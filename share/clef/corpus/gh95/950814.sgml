A SMALL town on the north-east coast is the centre of what can be the
most enjoyable of family visits. St Andrews and the East Neuk of Fife is
that rarest of areas, wonderful for a day visit, but even better for a
longer stay.
The university town of St Andrews is world-renowned, for much more
than its sporting stature as the Home of Golf. Most of the town's
attractions are well within walking distance of the car parks and bus
station -- which makes St Andrews the ideal choice for a day out with
small children or grandparents whose legs may get tired more easily.
The town can combine as a ''double-header'' day out with any of the
picturesque villages along the coast or can provide a packed few hours
in itself. Any golfer in the party will be drawn to the British Golf
Museum, which is open seven days from 10am to 5.30pm. It traces the
game's 500-year history and can only whet the appetite of any enthusiast
for the next big event being played over the Old Course -- the Dunhill
Cup from October 19 to 22.
St Andrews' other historical attractions are even older than the game
-- the town has a fascinating cathedral, museum, and castle as well as
Scotland's oldest university. With the university comes an influx of
young people and it is their vibrancy along with the rich heritage of
the buildings and shore that make St Andrews a favourite haunt for all
ages. Even the Sea Life Centre on The Scores with its resident rescued
seals, makes a point of letting visitors know something of their marine
history.
Heading south down the coast, stop off in Kingsbarns for a moment of
tranquillity in Cambo Gardens, two-and-a-half acres of walled garden set
in stunning parkland with an ornamental bridge, a Chinese bridge, and a
summer house.
The atmosphere is less relaxing, but nevertheless riveting a short
drive away at Troywood, just outside Crail, where you can experience
what the great and the good would have been doing in the event of a
nuclear attack.
Scotland's Secret Bunker is situated 100ft underground and was the
nuclear war command centre, from which armed forces' leaders would have
run the country in the event of attack. It is open 10am to 6pm and has a
distinct atmosphere -- the thought of what could have been is never far
from your mind . . .
When you reach Crail itself the peace of this fishing village is
immediately apparent. It has that typical Scottish coastal beauty which
attracts so many foreign visitors, who all hope to find the Local Hero
village. After a stroll through the quiet cobbled streets and down to
the harbour, visit the Crail Museum and Heritage Centre or the Tolbooth
to get a flavour of the oldest East Neuk burgh. Another short trip
brings you to Anstruther, a village that has used its famous fishing
history to its advantage, with the Anstruther Fisheries Museum, which
since 1969 has been telling locals and visitors the stories of the men
who often risked their lives to bring home the catch and the women who
kept the families together until the boats arrived back safely.
Pitenweem also has a history inextricably tied up with the sea, but
this month it's the arts which are the centre of attention in the
village. The village's arts festival brings together the works of some
of Scotland's most foremost artists in intimate galleries. Just a short
walk from the centre of the village is St Fillan's Cave, now treated as
a shrine, it goes deep into the rock and is said to have been the
retreat of a Christian missionary.
The National Trust for Scotland has many of the village's properties
in its care, including Kellie Castle which lies three miles inland. It
has superb examples of sixteenth and seventeenth-century domestic
architecture and a walled garden, ideal for a spot of quiet
contemplation.
There are also excellent family holiday locations with beaches and
sheltered bathing areas on the coast. On the Firth of Forth, Elie and
Earlsferry both offer attractions for families and sportsmen --
windsurfers and golfers will find the area meets their requirements
beautifully. There is only one problem with the East Neuk of Fife -- the
choice. It would be difficult to soak up the individual atmosphere of
every village mentioned in a day, but the combination of two or three at
a time will make for many happy family days away.

CONSUMER spending on ''big ticket'' items such as cars and washing
machines is set to increase, the Chartered Institute of Marketing
forecast today.
Shoppers have been spending freely on non-durable goods like food,
drink, and clothing but refraining from borrowing to buy bigger items
because of job insecurity, said the institute in its latest quarterly
State of the Market report.
But tax cuts ahead of the next election after two years of increases,
rising real incomes, and a series of special factors, such as the
unfreezing of the first Tessas and building society payouts following
mergers and takeovers, should boost consumer spending.
Shoppers may also benefit from a slight fall in interest rates over
the next 18 months, said the institute.

CREATIVE artists -- even the outgoing, articulate kind -- can find it
difficult to talk about their work. A disconsolate theatre director once
wailed at my obdurate questioning -- ''Work is what we do, not what we
talk about . . .'' Which is why the short film showing at Filmhouse 1
today at 10.30pm is such a gem.
It traces, in gentle, grainy black and white, the making of a dance
piece. While choreographer Mark Morris and cellist Yo-Yo Ma explore
together the resonances of Bach's Third Cello Suite, and while dancers
go through the emerging steps, the camera -- like the best of flies on a
rehearsal room wall -- persuades us it has caught them unawares . . .
has snaffled the private jokes, the stalemates, and frustrations, the
spark of inspiration. And indeed, a sense of all that is certainly
conveyed.
What shines through, rather movingly, is the growing rapport between
Ma and not just Morris alone, but the entire company. Fairly early on in
rehearsals, Ma had asked if he should sit in, learn what the
choreography was about -- he was, after all, going to be playing live
for the performance that rounds off the film. You subsequently see him
at rehearsal, face glowing with a kind of surprised joy as he tells the
dancers -- ''I don't need the music any more. I just have to watch you
guys and it's clear''.
This sense of camaraderie and -- more than that -- artistic security
persists even into the ordinarily sacrosanct reaches of the recording
session. For there, like cheerleaders, are Morris and dancer Guillermo
Resto, their arms patterning the music as Ma plays. Moments like these
-- Ma yet again so utterly taken by the way he hears the Bach through
their movements -- warmly reinforce Morris's status as an inately
musical choreographer.
In all, an utterly engaging glimpse behind scenes that leaves one
longing to see the final dance work performed on stage. The film is a
perfect coda, too, to a festival day that has seen both Ma and Morris
performing, albeit separately. Movements In Time: Bach Suite 3 -- how
about it for next year, Mr McMaster?

Edinburgh's Filmhouse has had a facelift. There is a new temporary
facade concealing the grimy stonework while, inside, the bar has been
transformed into a scarlet-and-silver-draped nightclub straight out of a
Hollywood musical, a tribute to the Stanley Donen retrospective which
promises to be one of the highlights of the programme. The film festival
opened last night with a scarlet-and-black gala British premiere of Ken
Loach's Land and Freedom proof that in spite of the glitter it is the
films that matter and even gala audiences should be asked to think, says
William Russell
A HEART-BREAKING story about war's effects on the lives of ordinary
people, Land and Freedom is Ken Loach's most ambitious work to date.
Loach shows he is not afraid to tackle new ideas, a daring illustrated
by the long discussion of collectivisation which stops the drama in its
tracks midway. His political message is consistent, but his films are
infinitely varied.
A European co-production, it is a film to applaud, to greet with awe
and admiration. While there are those on the left who do not agree with
Loach's version of history, that does not detract from the skill with
which he tells the story or the way he uses his documentary skill to get
his message across.
David, a young unemployed Liverpool man (finely played by Ian Hart) is
persuaded at a communist meeting to go to Spain to fight for the
workers. He meets Blanca (Rosana Pastor, quite superb), falls in love,
and is gradually disillusioned about the war and the infighting between
the factions on the left. She is killed, David goes home, Spain becomes
an interlude in his life, something packed away in a suitcase. His
family forget he was ever there, and what he did is only rediscovered
after his death half a century later by his granddaughter going through
his belongings.
Loach has secured performances of the highest calibre from his
multi-national cast and this moving film, with a powerful script by Jim
Allen, has been magnificently photographed by Barry Ackroyd.
Also a powerful political polemic, Mario van Peebles's Panther suffers
from an over-strident approach. About the rise of the Black Panther
movement from humble beginnings on Oakland in the 1960s, van Peebles's
hysterical directorial style damages his case, and the film is at its
best when he occasionally adopts a quasi-documentary approach to the
material. A little more restraint and he would have made a far more
important film.
The playing, by a largely unfamiliar cast, is universally good, and
the film holds the attention throughout but, like Malcolm X, it suffers
from overstatement and a decision to treat the villains, by and large
white men, as grotesques. There is no reason why a polemic should play
scrupulously fair, but it should treat the enemy seriously. Panther
fails to do that to its detriment.
Kevin Costner plays Stephen Simmons, a Vietnam veteran in Jon Avnet's
The War. Back home in Mississippi, Simmons is trying to come to terms
with the trauma of having abandoned his best friend to his death on the
battlefield, rediscover his family, and find a job. A charming film,
nicely played by Costner and very well played by the child actors,
Elijah Wood and Lexi Randall, as his hot-headed son Stu, the image of
his father, and tomboy daughter, Lidia, it suffers from an overwhelming
feeling of deja vu. We have seen it all before in other and better
films.
Mare Winningham, in the Sally Field role of downtrodden mother, is
touching, Costner subdues his superstar persona to turn in a decent
performance, and the children, especially Wood, are very good indeed.
But it remains a shopworn affair.
* Panther, Filmhouse 1 -- 8.15 tonight, UCI -- 7.30 Wednesday; The
War, MGM -- 8.15 tonight.

WITHIN 30 minutes of arriving in Edinburgh I was up on stage. I know
what you're thinking. Theatre slut. Frustrated ham. Can't keep himself
away from it. I swear it's not like that, but there was no arguing with
Kiev Theatre of Podol. They singled me out from the audience. I never
had any choice.
It was the press launch for Edinburgh Venue Associates. Go around as
many freebies as you can on Saturday, I was instructed by the features
desk. And write a diary. So there I was arriving, hot foot from the
station, and only in time to squeeze into the front row at the door.
They were performing extracts, but I hadn't caught the introduction to
Podol's contribution. I was exchanging greetings with friends I hadn't
seen since last year, marking my card with photographer Geraint Lewis of
the Independent, who had been in since last week. The next moment there
were two characters on stage pointing at me.
It was full eye contact stuff. Something like him saying, ''Oh,
there's Toby over there.'' And she says, ''Oh, Toby! Toby!'' They were
giving it long-lost friend stuff, which is disconcerting when you've
never met the folk in your life. And he comes over. His hand comes out,
beckoning. It's horrific. I'm trapped. It's a case of making a run for
it back out the door, or just going through with it.
I went centre stage with him and planted her a kiss on each cheek. She
seemed pleased to see this Toby character that I was evidently supposed
to be, and I assumed it was the kind of thing he would have done.
Whoever he was. I didn't even know what play we were in. Not that it
would have mattered. They were performing in Russian.
The kisses turned out to be a wee bit of a mistake. Toby, it emerged,
was a horse. I first realised I was playing a horse when they shoed me
and flung on a bridle. A very alarming moment. And Geraint was taking
pictures. So was Dennis Straughan of the Scotsman. It wasn't a kiss I
was supposed to give her. It was a ride.
I whinnied. If it is possible to freeze on stage and break into a
nervous lather simultaneously, that's what I did. Not many points for
dressage, I'm afraid, but I had to get off of there quickly.
This was the deal. I mention their show here, and they let me go. It
is Chekhov Anecdotes at Moray House Theatre, until August 27. Word of
advice: if you hear the name Toby, get well out of range.
* * *
ANOTHER Linklater making a spectacle of himself was former Scotsman
editor, Magnus. I've been longing for a chance to say in print that I'm
neither related to the man nor in any way responsible for what he does
or says.
It was difficult to say who was more embarrassed at the launch of the
Edinburgh Book Festival, him or his freeloading audience in the Beck's
Spiegeltent. His cringing introduction, ''the greatest big books
festival in the world'', was more than the laws of singing for your
supper require.
But when he bent down to an intractable microphone which refused to
rise above his knees, and performed a physical contortion that looked
suspiciously like a revival of the funky chicken, it was too much.
''This will do nothing for my image,'' he muttered.
What image?
* * *
HEATHROW sniffer dogs alerted Customs when the Shamans Theatre Company
tried to bring their set over from Budapest for The Tale (at the Tron
last week) and the new show Amine (at Demarco's, tomorrow until August
26). Set? It is a single armchair, specially designed to conceal teddy
bears and support performers walking tightrope along its headrest.
The dogs had the sniffies for it as it came through baggage,
signalling a full drugs alert. They wanted the stuffing out of the
thing. It was looking nasty, with little prospect of it being released
in time for their opening performance dates, until Eva Magyar drew the
attention of officials to its secret compartment. Fortunately, Hungarian
glue is not yet a banned substance.

AN adaptation of Lucy Ellmann's hep, funny novel, this sprightly
two-hander explores the bitter-sweet nuances of a relationship between
two very different sisters, the spikey Fran and the softie Suzy, and
their respective responses to food -- Fran's anorexic, Suzy overeats.
High-energy performances from Charlotte Jones and Liz Webb (bouncing
all over the stage and leaping atop a big Frigidaire), and eclectic
musical snatches, from the ravey Ride on Time to Tammy Wynette and
blasts of Nessun Dorma, keep the action bubbling along nicely. Grounded
in stand-up comedy, they deploy a mixture of dramatic styles, from
poignant reflection to audience interrogation, in a series of linked
sketches. Some lack ingenuity but it's all frothy, frenetic fun.

JIMMY Porter, John Osborne's iconoclastic angry young man, is given a
right going-over in Frantic Theatre Company's inspired interpretation.
Fracturing the text, self-consciously referring to stage directions and
introducing physical sequences at odds with the sentiments spoken -- the
archetypal victim Alison Porter transformed into a powerful, disdainful
manipulator -- Frantic's physical theatre approach undermines Jimmy at
every turn.
While he rants and rails, Alison, Cliff, and Helena literally dance
rings around him, smirking at his spleen. However, this is no lampoon
but ingenious subversion. Frantic stretch the structure of the play but
never puncture its heart. Jimmy retains his fierce dignity and power.
Magnificent theatre which elides innovation with convention -- the
ironing board as icon -- to mesmeric effect.

CIRQUE Surreal is -- in the best traditions of new circus -- more
stardust than sawdust.
The absence of animal acts has meant a rethink in the presentation of
such familiar skills as juggling, tumbling, high-wire work, and
clowning. Cirque Surreal has achieved this repackaging with flair and
imagination. They create a dream world of fantastical figures, some
exotic, some bizarre, but all lending an air of intrigue and mystique --
even to the business of setting up equipment.
But it's not just surface, here. The acts are impressive without the
trappings. Look out for some dramatic aerial artistry, a cyclist whose
abilities know no bounds (except when he's on a trampoline) and a demon
juggler -- in all a spectacularly stylish show that cleverly reinvents
circus for the nineties.

Theatre
IN the confines of the sweat box that is the Edinburgh Suite, Scarlet
Theatre have created a piece that redefines the term ''box set''. Total
theatre in miniature, it gives Robert Lepage's spinning cube for The
Dream Play a run for its money, using a simple garden shed and some
household tools.
On a Fringe that contains a few plays that take domestic violence as a
theme (usually from a revisionist male perspective), this one
concentrates on three victims: a mother and two daughters. Don't be put
off by visions of histrionics and angst -- this is more a surreal vision
of disturbed domesticity, as exploited by everyone from the Pythons to
David Byrne.
The performances of Grainne Byrne, Christine Entwhistle, and Jan
Pearson are honed to precision, and there is a hauntingly appropriate
score from Nigel Piper.

GOOD MORNING after the night before. Poulter and Duff blear through a
self-induced haze of mild narcosis. On the agenda the full
pharmacopoeia; on the menu a few of its (legal) entries. Free alcohol,
carob (safer than chocolate!), herbal ecstasy, kava kava, or nicotine
for willing volunteers.
This is a humorous description of recreational drugs' effects. An
amusing laugh at our would-be moral guardians. A minor tilt at a society
which outlaws the fun drugs, fails to deal with the pernicious ones, and
legalises the most addictive and useless. But there is not quite enough
of it. Like trying to make one joint go round a whole party, it's mildly
stimulating but not the full-blown trip.

SOME ageing musicians simply play on their reputations, but Jimmy
''Walking By Myself'' Rogers didn't even play the song that gave him his
name. Not that this mattered in the end. Now 73, Mississippi-born,
Chicago-based Rogers still possesses a rich, strong blues-singing voice
and although he didn't play guitar that much what he did play was
confirmation of an individual talent with his own electrified country
blues sound.
Backed by his splendid, hard working, and hard driving five-piece
band, including the redoubtable Piano Willie and a harmonica player
whose prodigious perspiring produced a novel take on the expression
''rinsing out a shirt'', Rogers produced a satisfying and crowd-pleasing
performance, including his former boss, Muddy Waters's Got My Mojo
Workin'.

Woodley as the classic knockabout double-act (''Lano and Woodley have
re-created the tradition in their own image; they are Tom and Jerry
Lewis, Laurel and Ha-ha-ha' blah blah blah). There will be learned
dissections of the duo's grasp of humanity's innate stupidity,
cowardice, and infinite capacity for deception.
Academics will comment upon the fearful tension at the core of the
pair's relationship, noting that as surely as Lano and Woodley smite one
another, they know that neither can live without the other. Meanwhile,
us plebs will be remembering that side-splitting bit where Woodley was

RICHARD O'Brien's pervily-clad devotees in the front row loved it, but
then they've remained easily pleased for the past 20 years by the Rocky
Horror Show's first instalment. In other words, it's
pink-tutu-and-fishnet time again, mother. Camp rock-song pastiches
trundle hither and yon. Self-conscious decadence is the order of the
day. Along with rather too much gratutitous swearing from author and
frontman Richard, perhaps seeking to undermine the comfy status
conferred by a long spell in telly's Crystal Maze.
Plus a devilish awkward amount of learned references to Mephistopheles
Smith's theatrical raison d'etre, Hell.
Richard's verbose treatise -- a plea for fresh party-goers at Club
Inferno plc -- invokes Goethe, Samuel Johnson, Ruskin, Beardsley and
Edvard Munch. And while Richard is admirably nimble on-stage in his
outsize cloven hoofs, his relentless word-play trips him up.
Hell is other people's puns, alliterations and rhymes. Does the Devil
have all the best tunes, the best lines, the best tale? Not here, no,
unfortunately, damn it.

THE lush interplay of oral and visual textures unfolding in the
opening moments of State Theta's collaborative performance excited
expectation.
A beautifully synchronised blend of luminous abstract projection, rich
fabric, and bodies-in-motion created an almost tangible sense of the
deep lustre, mystery, and power of the gold of the title, successfully
fusing movement, sound and design.
By the close of the first act this confidence in abstraction and
understatement was seriously failing, with the piece slipping into
heavy-handed symbolism and overly literal narrative.
The company's political agenda, a simplistic opposition of the wise
and spiritual Kogi Indians driven from their lands and traditions by the
''civilising'' Spaniards crowded out the subtlety of the earlier
contemplative and evocative imagery.

and Ross Stenhouse as the hellish Beverley and Lawrence. Wince at the
nasty seventies props. SV
3pm: Singin' In the Rain, Filmhouse 1
* THE Stanely Donen retrospective gets off to a dazzling start with
the screenings of two of the finest musicals ever, both made with Gene
Kelly -- the immortal and well nigh perfect Singin' in the Rain and the
groundbreaking On the Town (Cameo 3, 6pm). WR
3.40pm: Pills, Thrills and Backache, Pleasance
* GREAT costumes -- pointy-toe boots, awesome stetsons,
black-and-white suits -- and brilliant songs. What more do you need?
Well, maybe a plot: this script only hints at the many questions in
Williams's short life. But if you're looking for a sing-along . . . DB
4.15pm, Soup, Pleasance
* IMPRESSIVE one-man show by Michael Mears, who probes society's
attitudes to the homeless through a series of colourful portraits, from
an ex-Oxford vegan don now dossing it to a recalcitrant Irish crone.
Gentle humour, impressive insight, and a memorable performance. SV
6pm: On the Town, Cameo 3
* SEE above.
6.15pm: Indiscreet, Filmhouse 1
* ROMANTIC comedy from Stanley Donen is lacklustre, but worth catching
because it's rarely seen, and was made in Britain with Cary Grant and
Ingrid Bergman. WR
7pm: Don Giovanni, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Usher Hall
* STELLAR cast (as usual) for the predictably thorough and excellent
annual Mozart opera under the scrupulous supervision of Sir Charles
Mackerras. Felicity Lott as Donna Elvira and Nuccia Focile as Zerlina
(scrummy) with Boje Skovhus as the randy Don. MT
7.15pm: The Jacobin, Festival Theatre
* DVORAK's opera, completely unknown, has become famous for a
fortnight in the light of the Scottish Opera chorus's industrial action.
You've had the crisis, now see the drama. MT
7.30pm: I was Looking at the Ceiling and then I saw the Sky, Royal
Lyceum Theatre
* IS it a bird? Is it an opera? Is it a musical? God knows. It
certainly is composer John Adams and director Peter Sellars. Their last
Festival opera involved an onstage jumbo jet. This time they're going
several better and bringing a Los Angeles earthquake. I kid you not. MT
7.30pm: Lanark, Assembly Hall
* THE most unpredictable element of the Festival Theatre programme is
surely this interpetation of Alasdair Gray's dense novel by TAG Theatre
Company, awaited with a mixture of intense curiosity and slight
trepidation. Workshopped for almost two years, the fevered worlds of
Duncan Thaw and Lanark finally hit the stage, scored by Alasdair
Nicolson. SV
7.45pm: Brothers of the Brush, Theatre Workshop
* DUBLIN playwright Jimmy Murphy paints a bleak and caustic picture of
life in the black economy in his highly-acclaimed drama about three
Irish house painters and their cost-cutting boss. Brilliantly realised
by Wiseguise Theatre Company, it's a compelling fusion of wry wit and
simmering tensions. SV
7.50pm: Violent Night, C Venue, Over Seas House
* EXPLOSIVE two-hander by the National Student Theatre Company, with
outstanding performances by Griffin Price and David Little. An incisive
exploration of male aggression which culminates in a fight far removed
from the trendy cartoon violence of movies. SV
8pm: Trainspotting, Assembly Rooms
* A GRIM antidote to picture-postcard Edinburgh, Harry Gibson's
adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel is brutal, vicious, sickeningly
graphic in its depiction of heroin abuse, stomach-churningly disgusting,
and utterly unmissable. SV
9.25pm: Sean Locke, Pleasance
* HIS drift may not be the easiest thing to catch, but wherever it's
going, it's very, very funny. Purchase tickets now for his surreal
spivvery; the manic gleam in his eye; the epic swell of his flared
pinstripe trousers. Sean Locke is chop-socky, top-yocks guy. DB
12am: Club Indigo at the Assembly Room
* A GENTLE way to ease into Festival clubbing with an oil slick of
cheesy listening in a cabaret format. TD

RICHARD Herring resembles a more caustic Ned Sherrin with added
swagger and a nicer smile. Cutie Stewart Lee is a black-clad droll with
a Gothabilly quiff. They've each got their own solo Fringe shows, too,
after having together successfully colonised first radio and then TV
with Fist Of Fun.
Now it's Edinburgh's turn to discover why they've been hailed as a
super-sarcastic Eric and Ernie for the post-Cobain generation. Whatever
that means. Principally it means that they are very much your young men
for the nihilistic scoffing and the total rupturing of the
already-strained boundaries of bad taste, to wit urolagnia and sexual
impropriety with flies and grandads. Fist Of Fun? Indeed. Painful but
oddly pleasurable at the same time.

Theatre
WITH two Fringe firsts already under their belt, Wierszalin Theatre's
third visit to Edinburgh was destined to arouse high expectations. They
do not disappoint. Klatwa tells the story of a young woman who has borne
the local priest two children and is persecuted by her fellow villagers
for causing the drought that has made their land barren.
Wierszalin invest this simple tale with such dramatic passion and such
a unique visual style that it is transformed into a tragedy of mythic
proportions. The austere set design, the haunting use of music, and the
emotional intensity of the performances drag us down into a dark
nightmarish world of hypocrisy and fear that is difficult to forget.
This is a show not to miss.

IT'S not cricket, is the cry when a real bounder is caught not playing
the game. The more cynical call it a gentleman's game played by
hooligans.
Championship leaders Aberdeenshire did not play their game when they
were due to meet the strong-going West Lothian at Boghall, despite the
good weather. Aspersions of ungentlemanly conduct on behalf of the
visitors, who had several top team players unavailable, rumbled in the
clubhouse grumbles.
The basics are thus: Aberdeenshire skipper Colin Mitchell was spending
the weekend in Glasgow. One car short. Mike Smith, Andy Bee and Chris
Mearns were unavailable. Now four cars short. Colin Smith, Neil McRae,
Neil Robertson and Chris Ferro had severe problems with a hired vehicle.
Now five cars short, along with four players.
Only seven Aberdeenshire men made it to the ground, and skipper
Mitchell not only declined to play in the hope that the stranded four
would make it some time in the afternoon but, it is said, he also
declined the opportunity to play the match yesterday.
The end result will be an extraordinary meeting of the Scottish County
Cricket Board's Emergency Committee, once secretary and treasurer Tom
Gibson can arrange it. He said yesterday: ''There will be an inquiry
into this. We have had no response from Mannofield officials, although I
have spoken to Colin Mitchell.''
The gentleman at the centre of the problem would seem to be Colin
Smith. The hired car in which he and his team-mates were travelling
suddenly filled with smoke near Stonehaven at around 10am on Saturday.
''There was smoke everywhere,'' said Smith. ''As I was getting out of
the car, I tripped and banged my head on the road.''
Smith was taken to hospital and also had to return later in the
evening for a further check-up. One of the other players attended to the
towing back of the hired car.
Meanwhile, messages did not reach Boghall until just before midday.
West Lothian skipper Steve Crawley remained diplomatic yesterday when he
commented: ''Let's just say that we are extremely disappointed that the
other Aberdeenshire players did not make an effort to get here. And the
ones who did arrive did not even make an effort to change into their
gear.''
The one irony to come out of all this is that, in June, Crawley's car
hit trouble on the way to Mannofield, and West Lothian arrived with only
nine men. They tossed up, and began the game with Crawley and David Orr
not arriving until around 3.30.
Under the percentage scoring system, by not playing Aberdeenshire
certainly did not lose anything. Neither did West Lothian.
But Ayrshire, by winning against Clackmannan County at Prestwick, took
over as league leaders. Dominic Rigby has been in inspired form with the
bat this season, and his 103, backed by an unbeaten 53 from David Harper
and a half century by David Haggo took them to 248 for three.
However, Harper's five for 20 was just too severe for the Wee County,
who could make only 116, despite Stewart Jonstone's knock of 36.
But when it comes to bowling honours, it's a long time since a county
player took nine wickets in a league match. Bryce Robertson of
Forfarshire did just that for the loss of only 34 runs at Forthill as
Perthshire crumbled for 100.
A half century from Graham Garden, 46 from John Phillips and 35 from
Mike Cousin had taken the home side to 219 for seven, with Jimmy Muir
taking three for 35.
Strathmore and Stirling drew at Lochside Park, although the home side
were in dire trouble at 21 for six at one stage before recovering to 105
for seven, thanks to an unbeaten 31 from Mark Kelaher. George McGuire
took five from 39 as Strathie chased Stirling's total of 196 for eight
in which Kyle Wealleans and Bruce Russell each made 47.
Arbroath's 220 for seven was too much for Fifeshire, who could muster
only 165 all out in reply.

WELSH OPEN
NOT even a wasp sting on her finger at the twelfth hole could halt
world No.1 Laura Davies as she completed a third European victory of the
season with a final round of 70 in the Woodpecker Welsh Open at St
Pierre yesterday, writes Bill Johnson.
Davies equalled the Tour record 21 victories of Scotland's Dale Reid
when her 14-under-par total of 278 left her three strokes clear of
Australian Wendy Doolan.
Reid was the leading Scottish challenger after a closing round of 70
left her at six-under to share fifth place.
There is nothing predictable about Davies, but she does give
spectators value for money. Yesterday was no exception when she started
the day two strokes clear of Marie Laure de Lorenzi and Doolan.
At the 552-yard first, which she had eagled on Saturday, Davies pushed
her drive behind the trees, bunkered her third, then skimmed the next
over the green. She finally holed from 12 feet for a double bogey 7 and
shared the lead when de Lorenzi birdied the second.
Birdies at the sixth and ninth took Davies to the final turn in 36 and
at 11-under she was now two strokes ahead of de Lorenzi with Doolan a
further two strokes behind.
Davies then left the remainder of the field playing for second place
when she birdied the eleventh and twelfth and finished the job by
chipping to six inches for a final birdie at the long sixteenth.
Doolan made up ground by coming home in 33, finishing her inward half
with birdies at three of the last five holes. Reid had started her round
with 6s at the first two holes. She birdied the seventh, holed from 40
feet for an eagle at the 309-yard next hole, where she drove the green,
before coming home in 34.
''It's great to tie with a person like Dale Reid who has been a
tremendous player on the Tour for so long,'' said Davies after chalking
up her careeer thirty-eighth victory.
Leading final scores (British or Irish unless stated):
278 -- L Davies 68, 69, 71, 70 (#9000).
281 -- W Doolan (Australia) 67, 72, 71, 71 (#6090).

* COLLEEN Walker birdied the last two holes, the second after a
sparkling bunker shot, to complete a 67 and tie Beth Daniel for the lead
after Saturday's third round of the LPGA PING-Welch's championship at
Canton, Massachusetts. Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
202 -- C Walker 67, 68, 67; B Daniel 65, 68, 69.

victory in the LPGA PING-Welch's Championship in Canton, Massachusetts.
Colleen Walker shot a 72 to share second with Meg Mallon, whose 68
included the first hole-in-one of her LPGA career.
* RAY Floyd made a birdie on the final hole yesterday for a four-under
68 and a one-stroke win over Graham Marsh in the Burnet Senior Classic
at Coon Rapids, Minnesota. Floyd, who earned $165,000 for his eleventh
win in four years on the Senior Tour, had a 15-under 201 total.

ENGLAND emerged unbowed, if not unscathed, after the West Indies had
replied yesterday to the home side's substantial total in a most
positive manner, finishing with a first innings deficit of a mere 23
runs.
But the excellent atmosphere created by another cheerful, capacity
crowd on the fourth day of the Fifth Test at Trent Bridge was dampened
with the injury to England's Nick Knight towards the end of the West
Indies innings.
The potentially dangerous blow to the back of the head, from the
second ball after lunch, came from a drive by Kenneth Benjamin. Knight,
who was at silly point and not wearing a protective helmet, received
attention on the pitch until a mobile medical unit arrived.
Later, a TCCB spokesman announced that there was no fracture and that
he was not unconscious at any time after having been hit. He was being
detained overnight at the Queen's Medical Centre for further
observation. His parents, who were at the match, were with him at the
hospital.
England physio Dave Roberts said: ''It was a nasty blow and he was
very lucky not to be more seriously hurt.
''There was not a lot of distance between Benjamin's bat and Nick's
head and the ball was going pretty fast.''
West Indies tour manager Wes Hall sent his team's best wishes to
Knight. Hall said: ''Kenny Benjamin was very upset at the time and not
only he, but the whole team, wanted to know how Nick was when they came
off the field.
''It's very unfortunate when people get hit, but it is part of
cricketing life.''
By close of play England, on 111 for two, were 134 ahead, and although
eight wickets remain, Knight and Illingworth (with a broken finger) are
unlikely to contribute much to the batting.
Atherton (38) and Thorpe (47) have put on 75 and, as the only
remaining front-line batsmen, they will need to extend their stand this
morning. To make the match safe, England have much batting to do today.
With a slender lead of 23, England made a poor start to their second
innings. As expected, John Crawley partnered Atherton in Knight's
absence, and lost his wicket for 11.
Twelve runs later England were two wickets down for 36 when Graham
Hick's leg stump went for a spectacular cart-wheel. He seemed uncertain
in his foot movement to a ball from Benjamin and, despite such a superb
batting performance in the first innings, he was clearly shaky during
his half-hour in making seven.
The West Indies' pace bowlers had generated a great deal of life from
the wicket, which continued to provide an excellent batting surface.
Atherton, in spite of receiving a hit on the left hand from Bishop,
and Thorpe steadied the England innings. Atherton began tentatively,
being beaten by Bishop and Walsh, but soon settled into the form he had
displayed in making his first innings century.
Thorpe also played fluently, and soon after the leg spinner Dhanraj
was brought on, he hit him for successive boundaries to long leg and
repeated the stroke off Bishop to get into his forties.
Earlier, the West Indies, having resumed on the overnight score of 334
for five, lost the first wicket after a half-hour's play when Dhanraj,
in attempting to fend off a rising delivery from Cork, gloved a catch to
Knight at gully.
With all the leading West Indies batsmen, barring Chanderpaul, having
been dismissed on the previous day, England needed to ensure that the
tourists' innings did not progress towards a total to match their own.
That would have taken the game towards the probability of a draw.
But led by 20-year-old Chanderpaul, the West Indies' late order hung
around till an hour before tea. The young Guyanese batsman's tenacious
style makes him a difficult man to shift.
It was not his day for runs yesterday, but he occupied the crease for
two hours, during which useful runs were added. They came mainly from
Courtney Browne, the wicketkeeper, in only his second Test.
His two successive boundaries off Fraser, a cover drive and a pull
square on the on-side, were a treat. But having hit 34, he went down the
wicket to drive Illingworth, missed, and Russell behind the stumps made
no mistake this time after his glaring blunder under similar
circumstances on the previous day.
England took three wickets during the morning session with Chanderpaul
going a quarter of an hour before Bishop, who fell to the last ball.
The West Indians added 33, in as many minutes, for the tenth wicket
with Walsh enjoying the swing of his bat much to the crowd's amusement.
His 19 included an enormous straight 6 to the Radcliffe Road end off
Illingworth.
Surprisingly, it is one of only two 6s hit in the two high scoring
innings of either side with a combined total of 857 runs.

ROUND BRITAIN CHALLENGE:
AS THE 10 crews, two each from rugby's traditional five nations,
answer the starter's cannon off Southend-on-Sea at four o'clock today
for the first 2200-mile Teacher's Round Britain Challenge, each will be
reflecting that one crucial part of the race is already over.
Last Monday near Southampton the four professional crew from each
nation met for the first time with their pool of 12, strictly amateur,
and largely novice sailors who will help crew the identical 36-foot
Jeanneau SunFast yachts in what is sailing's first Five Nations
Challenge and the first race around Britain and Ireland to be staged in
identical boats.
Part of a #3m investment by Teacher's, the organisers aim to produce a
five-week contest which is easily understood, and inspirational -- even
if only by virtue of the fact that the volunteer crew were chosen ''off
the streets'' from more than 3000 applicants judged for their sense of
adventure and the strength of their commitment rather than any measure
of sailing experience.
Since then each crew has raced the clock, with a four-day, 150-mile,
shakedown cruise from Port Solent to London to mould themselves into
teams capable of not merely coping with the worst seas and weather the
UK coastline can throw at them, but thriving under the monotonous mental
toil and unrelenting physical effort of racing for up to seven days at a
time.
The concept owes much to Chay Blyth, who has turned his 1992 British
Steel Round The World Challenge (against the prevailing winds and
currents in identical 67-foot steel boats with one professional skipper
and a paying crew) into a multi-million pound business, with more
companies than ever seeking to sponsor boats in his next event.
Three of the Teacher's Challenge skippers are former British Steel
Challenge skippers, including Scotland's Paul Jeffes, who skippered
Interspray to fourth place in that circumnavigation and will skipper
Lord Inverforth in this four-stage race.
Each skipper has a chosen professional first mate. Jeffes, who also
raced in the 1982 Round Britain race, has paired up with west-coast
sailmaker Chris Owen, while Scotland's other skipper, Jon Fitzgerald,
will head up the team on Glen Dronach and has elected to sail with Chris
Nichol as his mate.
The Scots, on paper, should be among the pacesetters. Between them
they estimate to having clocked up the equivalent ocean miles to five
times around the world, but all have specific complementary strengths.
With his British Steel race experience, Jeffes is an accomplished
team-builder, excellent navigator, and accomplished weather expert --
skills which are complemented by Owen's ability to make all types of
boats go quickly, and a polished close quarters strategist.
Fitzgerald, who manages a boatyard on Kerrera by Oban, is one of the
country's top one-design sailors -- specialising in the Sigma 33 fleet
in recent years, but that mainly inshore experience is bolstered by
thousands of ocean miles delivering yachts and a long spell teaching
sailing, at every level, at the National Watersports Centre.
That Scottish Sports Council centre on Cumbrae is home to Nichol, who
is chief instructor there, but he also completed two legs of the 1989-90
Whitbread race on With Integrity.
''Between us, we have a breadth and depth of expertise which, of the
teams we know, is unmatched,'' said Jeffes.
He sees the English skipper, David Alan-Williams, as the biggest
single threat. He has sailed on four Whitbread races, three Admiral's
Cups, and was a crew member on the trimaran, Enza, which set a new,
74-day record for sailing round the world, but having sailed against
England's other skipper, Vivien Cherry, on the British Steel race he is
confident that she is less serious opposition.
All 12 greenhorn volunteers underwent a detailed psychological profile
before they stepped aboard Lord Inverforth and Glen Dronach last week --
a method which Jeffes used extensively with his British Steel crew.
''If nothing else, it's a starting point, but we're quick to pinpoint
potential weaknesses and niggles and deal with them as soon as possible.
I'm a firm believer in a happy crew being a motivated, fast crew.''
Crew motivation and outside interest should be spurred from start to
finish since the race is scored by leg placings, not time aggregated on
successive legs.
This should also eliminate the big strategic gambles, instead keeping
the fleet close together.
The first leg is 465 miles to Cardiff, the second -- passing outside
Ireland -- is 665 miles to Rothesay (due Friday, August 25). From
Rothesay the 10 boats sail outside the Orkneys 740 miles to Hartlepool,
immediately followed by a 250-mile sprint to Southend to finish around
September 9.

ALEXANDER Cejka, having led all the way, won the Hohe Brucke Austrian
Open by four shots yesterday and then said he would shave his head like
Open champion John Daly.
The 24-year-old German, who won the Andalucia Open in Spain earlier in
the year, shot a final-round 70 for a four-round aggregate of 267, 21
under par and the lowest of the European PGA Tour this year.
Ryder Cup player Ronan Rafferty, who closed with a 69, Spaniard
Ignacio Garrido (68), and Dutchman Rolf Muntz (68) shared second place
on 271.
Cejka, who began the day five shots clear, said: ''I made a bet a few
weeks ago with my friend and coach Peter Karz that if I won again this
year we would both shave our heads.
''But I think I will wait until after the Czech Open in Marianske
Lazne next week. I was born there and I think people would like to see
the real Alexander Cejka.
''I did not say when I would shave my head but I think Peter and I
will do it together during the German Open in two weeks' time.''
Cejka, who escaped with his father from Czechoslovakia in 1980 when he
was nine and is now a German citizen, set several tour records for the
year in this tournament.
He had the lowest first round of 61, the best 36-hole aggregate of 129
and the best 54-hole total of 197 as well as the lowest fourth-round
aggregate.
Garrido, having started six shots behind, closed the gap to one after
11 holes while Rafferty was waiting to pounce only two behind.
But, when it mattered most, Cejka produced the goods with birdies at
the twelfth, fourteenth, and fifteenth to pull away again for a
well-deserved success.
Rafferty, who birdied the first, fifth and eighth but could not hole
any putts in the last 10 holes despite having several chances, at least
had one consolation.
He won #18,640 as compared to #8950 by fellow Irishman Paul McGinley,
who finished joint fifth on 274 after a last-round 71.
So Rafferty is now less than #37 behind McGinley in the order of merit
and has improved his chances of making Ireland's Dunhill Cup team which
will be decided after next week's Czech Open.
Stephen McAllister (67) and East Kilbride rookie Craig Ronald (72)
were joint top Scots on 278 in joint eighteenth place, bringing
McAllister close to the total earnings he needs to retain his card and
giving Ronald his best finish of the season.

* JOHN Morgan successfully defended his Forte PGA Seniors title in a
dramatic sudden-death play-off at Sunningdale yesterday.
The 51-year-old pro from West Kirby shot a closing three-under-par 67
to tie with overnight leader Antonio Garrido (69) on six under 204.
But the former Spanish Ryder Cup player, who had led over the first
two days, twice found sand on the way to a double bogey 6 at the
play-off hole, the eighteenth.
Morgan's bogey 5 was good enough to secure him the #15,000 first
prize, but he could have saved himself the agony of the play-off had he
not missed a two-footer on the final green.
Last year's senior Order of Merit winner, Morgan has been in solid
form again this year so far collecting #42,500 in a climb to second
place behind Senior British Open champion Brian Barnes, who missed the
event through injury.
Christy O'Connor, who beat his age with an opening 69, closed by
matching his 70 years for a four-over-par 214. Leading scores (British
or Irish unless stated):
204 -- J Morgan 67, 70, 67; A Garrido (Spain) 65, 70, 69 (Morgan won
play-off).
206 -- N Coles 71, 67, 68; B Huggett 75, 66, 65; L Higgins 69, 68, 69;
F Abreu (Spain) 68, 69, 69; J Jacobs (USA) 68, 68, 70.
207 -- B Verwey (S Africa) 68, 70, 69.

209 -- B Waites 70, 67, 72; A Croce (Italy) 71, 68, 70.
210 -- P Butler 73, 70, 67; M Bembridge 70, 68, 72; R Campagnoli
(Italy) 69, 70, 71

I MET the caveman in a petite French village street, not far from the
cave-drawing centre of Peche Merle, where there was room for only two
rows of voitures.
One lot was parked, taking up half the street-width; the other phalanx
was hurtling towards me and mine. I waited, as I'm not stupid. I know
three into two won't go. Yet behind me, a driver suddenly tooted, urging
me to surge forward to certain death so that he might circumvent the
resulting bloody carnage to get on his way. Was he blind? No, he was
French.
My rage was exceeded only by my disbelief. On this, as on every trip
to La Belle France, I had seen the most disgraceful displays of
disregard for other people's safety on high-speed highways; I had been
driven to breakneck speeds myself by screaming Batmobiles charging up my
backside; I had watched these then overtake on blind hill-brows, as if
it were not possible that something -- perhaps a nice innocent family
like mine -- might be coming up the other side; I had seen overturned
cars; people lying and crying, bloodstained, on the roadsides. I had
never seen so much madness.
One of the most disconcerting things about French roads is the tyre
marks. Every couple of kilometres you see stressed-rubber marks that
disappear under newly replaced crash barriers. Evidence of the many
horrors you have not witnessed.
And now . . . the illogicality and pomposity of this man's grand
toot-toot seemed to encompass for me all that was wrong with French
driving. A simple refusal to see that which is right in front of you,
not to mention that which might be over the hill or just round the bend.
A denial that another car is a solid lump of metal, and a fond belief
that, somehow, you can just float right through it in your cloud-riding
indestructability. Mon Dieu, I wondered, how can such laid-back,
civilised people transmogrify into such juvenile imbeciles behind the
wheel?
After he had soon overtaken us with all the fury and fanfare he could
muster -- high-pitched engine revving, more toot-toots, a cluster of
fellow-madmen charging tight up behind him on blind brow of blind bend
-- Mad Max turned up just ahead of us, six kilometres later, at the Cave
Parking.
My blood had risen. ''Don't do it,'' said my wife. But I slammed my
driver door and marched over to his vulgar, whale-like white Citroen.
''Pourquoi le toot-toot?!'' I demanded to know as he stepped out to
reveal that he was unshaven, pot-bellied, garlic-smelling, and only a
few metres short of Notre Dame.
He was big. He looked down on me like (I presume) Goliath did on
David, did not quite grab my shirt, and said -- I think -- ''Don't you
know the code of the road?''
I gulped as the rest of his Beverly-Hillbillies-lookalike family
emerged from the car and slowly circled round us. My wife started to
laugh. So did I, in a nervous, self-deprecating sort of way, as if to
say: ''Oh, silly me. I quite forgot it.''
Neither can I quite remember how we escaped. Somehow, my wife charmed
them, and in any case I could sense that violence while stationary held
much less appeal for them than the high-speed variety. On terra firma
they vaguely resembled humans. But when they went into the cave, I had
this strong urge to close the door behind them and lock it. That was
where they belonged. Under the road among the extinct mammoths, and
certainly not on it.

A WELL-browned squid peers up at me from the plate. An overcooked
squid is bad news, as chewy as rubber bands. Happily, this one is
tender, marinated and very lightly cooked as a good squid deserves to
be. The squid encounter was only one of many culinary pleasures over a
four-day break in what might be termed ''the western Midi''.
For a meander by car in this relatively unknown part of the South of
France, Toulouse makes an easy starting point. South of Toulouse and
west of Provence and the Rhone Valley lie the Corbieres Hills. Further
west are the Pyrenees above the long sweep of sandy beaches and lagoons
of Languedoc-Roussillon along France's south-west Mediterranean coast.
This part of France has been trampled by the armies of Charlemagne,
the Crusaders, the Black Prince, and more recently, by Impressionist and
Fauve painters.
The historically aware might easily feel overwhelmed by the volume of
black historical dramas that have taken place here over the past 1000
years or so.
An insouciant philistine might simply wander from vineyard to
vineyard, tasting the region's excellent wines and soaking up the sun in
open-air restaurants in village squares or beside the sea. The locals
claim that this is the hottest part of France. Even at the end of June,
it is hot, very hot.
A few kilometres north of Carcassonne, the medieval village of Caunes
Minervois surrounds a Benedictine abbey founded in the seventh century.
A local historian proudly dates the red mortar of the apse's Romanesque
stonework at between 1020-50. The abbey's cellar offers quite pleasant
wines.
Driving south, at sunset the walls and towers of Carcassonne stand
bathed in glowing light against the skyline. Heavily restored in the
nineteenth century by architect Viollet-le-Duc, Carcassonne is probably
the most impressive medieval walled city remaining, albeit restored, in
Europe.
What an impregnable fortress it must have appeared to the Black Prince
in 1355. Faced with the city's formidable double walls and 50 towers, he
turned back after burning the lower town.
According to legend, Carcassonne was defended against Charlemagne by
Lady Carcas, the widow of Balac, the last Saracen governor of the city.
After a five-year siege that brought the city to starvation, she finally
surrendered after one last desperate ruse.
The last sack of grain was fed to a pig before throwing it over the
battlements. When the pig burst, the attackers concluded that the city
still had food. However, when the attackers remained, a sad trumpet
sounded for a parley: ''Carcas sonne''.
One of the city's bulging towers is said ''to have bent to Charlemagne
and never straightened up''.
The brave lady was married by Charlemagne to one of his generals,
Trencavel, whose descendants were still ruling Carcassonne in 1209, when
knights from the north of France swept south in a crusade to rid the
region of its ''heretical'' Cathars.
Treacherously, the Count of Trencavel was seized during a parley under
safe conduct and is said to have been poisoned. The leaderless city
surrendered and fell under the rule of the brutal Simon de Montfort, the
father of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who led the English
Barons against Henry III.
South-east of Carcassonne, Lagrasse is classified as one of the most
beautiful villages in France. Its Benedictine abbey, built of warm
rose-coloured stone, dates back to the time of Charlemagne.
Driving north-east, the Cistercian abbey of Fontfroide (founded
eleventh century), is a bit of a historical jigsaw, having pointed
Gothic openings on one side of the cloister and rounded arches above
carved Romanesque capitals on the other.
North-west of Narbonne, the tiny medieval village of Minerve is
perched heroically above an encircling gorge. During the Albigensian
crusade in 1210, after the village was bombarded from the opposite hill
by catapults, Simon de Montfort (he of Carcassonne) destroyed the
village's sole source of water and burned to death all 180 inhabitants.
Amazingly, the small church contains possibly the oldest altar of Gaul,
dated 456AD.
Moving some distance north-east, the Abbey of Valmagne near Pezenas
and Montpellier, offers more fine wines. Valmagne's octagonal cloister
within a cloister shelters the fountain of a spring discovered by the
Romans, which has never run dry. Amid the drone of cicadas and the
gurgling of the fountain, the sunlight filters through the ''roof'' of
entwined vines. Surely this must be one of the most soothing, tranquil
enclosures ever created by man.
Although still unspoiled, the picturesque hilltop village of Castelnou
has already been discovered, the cheapest house now costing around
#80,000.
From Castelnou, we head south along the coast to Collioure, where
Matisse painted the colourful fishing boats through The Open Window.
Enterprising Collioure has laid out a ''Fauve trail'', attaching prints
of Matisse and Derain to walls where the scenes were painted. The
stepped pedestrian lanes of Collioure pass beneath cascades of
bougainvilia. This charming seaside town has only 2700 inhabitants in
winter, rising to 15,000 in summer -- with 50,000 visitors per day
during July and August.
The seventeenth-century church stands to one side of the harbour, its
tower once a lighthouse. The side altars hold a wealth of gilt baroque
Catalan altarpieces, exuberantly carved with vines and grapes.
By the port, the Templiers restaurant, its three floors of paintings
hung eye-level to ceiling, must have served as the inspiration for that
cinema and TV commercial in which a French barman takes yet another
painting as payment for a drink.
At Banyuls, a few kilometres nearer to Spain, a Scot named William
Robertson, who has lived in Banyuls for 20 years, manages a wine
co-operative. He gladly shows visitors around and pours the sweet
aperitif and dessert wines for tastings. Try the special Banyuls Etoile,
aged in the sun.
To the east is Perpignan, in medieval times a wealthy port, centre of
weaving and leather work. Sadly, all that remains of the city walls is
an impressive red brick fortress-gate, the Castillet. The remaining city
walls were torn down at the beginning of this century.
For a long period ruled by Kings of Mallorca, who also held Aragon,
Barcelona, Valencia, Roussillon and Montpellier, the heart of Perpignan
is undoubtedly the Place de la Loge, paved in marble, overlooked by the
thirteenth century Hotel de Ville, and the Shipping Exchange, Now ''the
most elegant fast-food restaurant in France,'' according to a local
cynic.
Three bronze arms protruding from the Hotel de Ville symbolise the
three estates of the population represented in the medieval town
council.
Across town, the old Palace of the Kings of Mallorca seems rather
austere, but originally the bare interior walls were gaily painted, like
wallpaper.
The only remaining Romanesque sculpture in Perpignan, a seated Christ,
adorns the side door of the medieval cathedral of St Jean. Inside, under
the organ loft hangs a comical carved wooden head whose mouth used to
open when the organ played. How the children must have loved it.
The trouble with France is that however long the stay, it is never
quite long enough.

IRELAND v SCOTLAND
SCOTLAND'S cricketers, devastated by the sudden death of chairman of
selectors Hugh Stevenson on Saturday, lifted themselves bravely
yesterday to record an eight-run win in the first of two one-day
internationals in Dublin.
Skipper George Salmond had vowed that his side would do their best out
of respect for one of the game's leading officials. And so it proved.
Right from the start openers Bruce Patterson and Iain Philip grabbed
the initiative, and while it was not one of their vintage partnerships,
the pair proved again that their double act is the one most likely to
provide a solid foundation.
Stenhousemuir's Philip was first to go, but not before he had rattled
33 brisk runs. And his 72-run partnership with Patterson provided the
base for others to thrive.
Big-hitting Patterson survived chances off two successive balls and
went on to reach a half-century. By the time he became one of Uel
Graham's three victims he had made 58 from 118 balls, with seven 4s.
But the real fireworks were provided by the classy Mike Smith. The
Aberdeenshire batsman was at his imperious best, peppering the
boundaries with a range of attacking shots. His 65 came off just 50
balls and included 11 boundaries.
Uddingston's George Reifer was also going well until he was judged lbw
to Graham. But there was more disappointment for George Salmond, out for
just 6 to continue a disappointing sequence of scores since taking over
as captain.
The Irish reply got off to the worst possible start when they lost two
wickets with just 11 runs on the board. However, they rallied superbly
through experienced opener Stephen Warke and Neil Doak.
Indeed, Doak appeared to have the game in his grasp, having raced to
43 in a mere 27 balls. Then a sudden rush of blood saw him charge down
the wicket to Greig Williamson, whose straight delivery sent the stumps
tumbling.
Graham took up the challenge and also looked capable of turning the
game in Ireland's favour until he was run out going for a suicidal
second.
Grange gloveman Alec Davies also contributed to the Scottish cause
with two smart stumpings off Reifer's medium pace.
In the end it was left to young Scott Gourlay to grab the final wicket
with four balls left and the Irish eight runs short.
Coach Jim Love said: ''That was a fine performance by our lads in very
difficult circumstances. Mike Smith's innings was the real highlight,
but everyone pulled together.''

THE skirl of the pipes always makes the hairs on the back of my neck
stand on end and one of the greatest contributions given to the world of
music by the Scots is the pipes. So said Glasgow's Lord Provost Tommy
Dingwall on Saturday at the The World Pipe Band Championship held in the
Scotstoun Leisure Centre in Glasgow.
Well, Tommy, the skirl of the pipes does the same for the back of my
neck, too, but that is not too difficult really. Practically the only
hairs I have anywhere near my head these days are on the back of my
neck. But you are right at that.
It is not just the pipes and drums of course; the sheer spectacle of
the most glorious national dress in the world, even if there is a
certain invention to it, makes you greet with pride in our nation's
exoticism. Try me out with Heilan' Laddie. Try you out. The pipes have
two functions. There is a drone which does all the background work. The
fingering of the chanter is a different matter. Piping is a little like
ballet or ballroom dancing. The man does all the work and the feminine
article, the tune, the air, does the lace around it all.
And this is the biggest pipe band tournament in the world, oh, far and
away. There were 194 bands taking part from airts and pairts, Canada and
the United States, Australia and New Zealand, Northern Ireland, England,
Holland, and South Africa and wherever there is a Scot or a descendant
of one. Provost Dingwall was having hairs standing up not just because
of the glorious sound of the pipes, but the glorious sound of
international harmony, permitted by we Scots.
I had turned up at Scotstoun for the tug o' war actually, but there
wasn't one: there was the Strength Athletics, a spin-off in recent years
of Celtic and Gaelic sports. This is the Strongman tourney, in which
some of the strongest men in the world compete.
There were these massive athletes pulling cars by arm strength alone,
and massive wheels on an axle being lifted overhead, an extremely
demanding, if somewhat primitive, form of weightlifting. Professional
weightlifters and athletes do not scorn such bucolic sports: they earn a
living around the Celtic and Highland games.
Dundee's Brian Bell has long been a competitor and showed well, but
the entrant who showed best perhaps was Sebastian Abbatiello from
Worcester, a business development manager for a computer firm.
Sebastian, of Italian origin obviously, plays the Scottish circuit and
enjoys it, but he was the hero of the weightlifting for, though he
couldn't lift the weight ascribed to him, it was no wonder because he
had recently ripped muscles and that isn't just painful. That's a lot of
courage and tenacity. Sebastian is a huge man who weighs only 17 stones
because he is so fit and he came up to Glasgow for the fun. ''I tried a
lift,'' he said, ''but I'll just enjoy the rest of the day. I like to
watch the pipe bands.''
I watched the pipe bands too, just to stir the blood. The winners were
the hitherto unfancied Simon Fraser University Pipe band from Burnaby,
near Vancouver. Dr Daniel Weeks is a major factor in the band. Well, he
would be -- he is the director for human factors and interface
technology, (''I'm a psychologist and even I can't understand the
psychology of those who think up a title like that'') -- and there was
piper Dave Hicks from the Canadian winners. We had a dram together for
the simple reason that we shared the same birthday two days before, the
tenth of August. I am 52 and look older. He is not 52 at all and looks
like Richard Gere, the bugger. They were happy to win but, though they
understood and sympathised with the problem, were quite rightly critical
of the Scotstoun venue.
The problem was that Bellahouston Park, the usual spot for this World
Championship, is out of operation due to work in progress (there are
rumours of subsidence and lack of safety), and Scotstoun, which is
indeed a splendid leisure centre, owned and operated by Glasgow Parks
and Recreation, is very dusty indeed for it is used also for athletics,
and this hampered the pipers considerably, even psychologically, said Dr
Weeks. ''You want to look your best in your dress. Red dust on the
brogues and the spats and your costume doesn't make for confidence
really, and though we won, I suspect some of the bands were indeed
affected. Let us hope Bellahouston gets back to its proper state in time
for next year.''
Gaelic and Celtic sports are there, of course, though it might be
pushing it a bit to call piping a sport itself. What most certainly is,
is the highland dancing. Over the years I have argued this, as a
one-time highland dancer myself, and the youngsters were out in force.
Sadly few boys take part and there is a certain demise in both numbers
and quality, even among the girls, while there has been a remarkable
increase in interest in Irish dancing, much recently as a result of the
remarkable pyrotechnics of the Irish dance troupe Riverdance.
But the girls are still dancing. Vancouver's Estelle Clewes, who was
runner-up last year, came third this year, and there were a remarkable
number of Canadian entrants, for highland dancing is hugely popular in
North America. Would that it were so here. And bring back the boys
dancing. Michael Tucker from London, Ontario, was there, dressed like
the most beautiful shortbread tin you have ever seen.
There were nearly 30,000 people at Scotstoun on Saturday, and 4000
competitors. And we, like young Michael, aged nine, were dancing all the
way, and with a feather in our caps.

EDINBURGH financier Simon MacKenzie extended of his season's victory
account yesterday when he disposed of Powfoot's Craig Hislop at the
first extra play-off hole in the Standard Life Gold Medal at Leven, so
proving the worth of his Scottish Amateur success.
Indeed, a nine-under-par course record of 63 in the first round from
the newly crowned champion confirmed his emphatic win at Southerness was
due neither to out-of-sorts opponent Hugh McKibbin nor a weakened field.
The West Linton competitor was only caught after 72 holes by the former
Scottish Youths champion on an 11-under-par, four-round total of 273.
At the first extra hole, a wayward approach from Hislop found a
greenside bunker from where he took two attempts to find the green. With
his rival safely on the putting surface in regulation the Borders player
conceded the tournament.
The 25-year-old's victory is all the more remarkable considering he
enjoys none of the benefits of full-time amateurism. He hit only 100
practice balls entering the oldest amateur strokeplay tournament in the
world.
Bathgate's Stephen Gallacher returned to competitive action yesterday
only to be narrowly denied victory, so justifying his controversial
decision to skip his country's flagship event.
The 20-year-old, who enjoyed two weeks of rest and recuperation from a
period of high-intensity golf, carded closing rounds of 67 and 72 across
the linksland layout. His title aspirations were dashed with a hook out
of bounds at the closing hole for a double bogey. Leading scores:
273 -- S MacKenzie (West Linton) 63, 70, 68, 72; C Hislop (Powfoot)
68, 66, 72, 67. (MacKenzie won at first play-off hole).
275 -- S Gallacher (Bathgate) 67, 69, 67, 72; A Reid (Kilmarnock
Barassie) 71, 66, 68, 70.
280 -- B Wann (Nairn) 70, 70, 74, 66; S Carmichael (Cardross) 67, 71,
73, 69; B Collier (Callander) 71, 67, 72, 70; D Downie (Ladybank) 65,
68, 74, 73.
282 -- M Brooks (Carluke) 70, 69, 72, 71.
283 -- L Salariya (Downfield) 72, 69, 69, 73: M Donaldson (Kirkcaldy)
71, 74, 66, 72; A Turnbull (Innerleithen) 71, 70, 70, 72.
* WALKER Cup player Padraig Harrington broke the day-old course record
at Lahinch yesterday with a six-under-par 66 for a 140 total in the
second qualifying round of the Irish Amateur championship in County
Clare. He beat Bryan Omelia, who set the record 67 in Saturday's first
round and also finished on 140, on the better second round.

WE turn our attention today to a sport in which Scotland used to lead
the world but in which we have recently lost it to a bunch of
Scandinavians and sundry central European upstarts.
No, it isn't football. We lost that contest a long time ago. We are
talking about ballroom dancing. And, before you start, it is a sport
recognised by the Sports Council. And thoroughly recommended by them
too, as a healthy pursuit.
TV viewers last Monday night may have seen Scotland crashing out in
the first round of the all-new international Come Dancing competition.
It has to be said that the Scots were humiliated in this world cup of
waltz and pasa doble.
Sweden beat us 15-10. Apparently we could equally well have lost to
Poland, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, or Holland in the Marshall
Amplification Trophy, as the Come Dancing international prize is known
after its sponsors.
Defeat was particularly bitter in the formation dance section, an
aspect of the sport in which Scotland used to excel. The Scottish
entrants, the Harris formation team, lost out to a bunch of kids from
Gothenburg. This surely raises questions as to whether Hebridean
formation dancing is strong enough to compete at international level.
A ballroom dancing source close to the Diary tells us the kids from
Gothenburg were fresh and innovative, reminiscent of the famous Peggy
Spencer team from Penge, regarded as the Manchester United of formation
when British ballroom dancing was in its heyday.
So, where did it all go wrong? As in many sporting pursuits, our
ballroom skills have been devalued because of an unwillingness to change
at the top level, lack of a vigorous youth policy, and lack of
investment in the players, sorry dancers.
Alan Dee, who runs the D Scool of Latin American and Ballrom Dancing
in Paisley, and is a former competitor, points to a lack of proper
facilities: ''Scandinavian and other European countries have lavish
dance clubs. Ballroom dancing is encouraged in the schools. The amateur
dancers have sponsorship which enables them to put in the hours of
practice required to reach the top.
''It is a costly business competing and fewer and fewer British
couples can afford to take part. Britain used to be the leader and the
world came to learn from us. Now many countries are ahead of us.''
The young talent just isn't coming through as it used to. Glasgow, a
city famous for its standard of ballroom dancing, has only the Plaza
Ballroom when it used to have so many venues you could go to a different
one each night of the week. The Locarno is now a casino and the
Dennistoun Palais a supermarket.
Perhaps when Ernie Walker has finished his investigation of the plight
of Scottish football, he can turn his attention to the dancing.
* YOU might have imagined that only the residents of distant planets
would be unaware that Paul Gascoigne has joined the Rangers. But step
forward the Guinness Soccer Who's Who which describes itself as ''the
most authoritative source of information'' on players in the English
leagues, the Scottish premier league, and British footballers playing
abroad.
The Guinness is sufficiently up to date to record David Ginola's
turning down Celtic for Newcastle. But it still describes GazzaTM as
playing for Lazio.
* RANGERS may be numerically the best-supported team in Scotland but
they are also the most disliked, according to a readers' poll in the
almost-intellectual footie magazine The Absolute Game.
In reply to the question ''Which Scottish team do you most dislike?''
the Teddy Bears received a thumping 67%, Celtic were second with 17%,
and Partick Thistle a long way behind in third with 2%.
The reasons quoted for this animus against the Rangers were bigotry,
sectarianism, loyalist associations (56%) followed by arrogance (14%)
and financial power and greed (11%).
The main reasons quoted for disliking the Tims were bigotry,
sectarianism, Irish republican leanings, and those favourite Parkhead
traits -- paranoia and persecution complex.

SCOTTISH internationalist Alison Rose set a course record
five-under-par 65 on her way to victory in the Mary McCallay Trophy at
Dumfries &amp; Galloway yesterday.
The Stirling bank clerk cashed in on her opening round with a 68 for a
seven-under-par total of 133 to win by four strokes from Stanraer's
Marion Wilson. Leading scores:
133 -- A Rose (Stirling) 65, 68. 137 -- M Wilson (Stranraer) 66, 71.
138 -- C Divers (Douglas Park) 72, 66. 141 -- D Douglas (Dumfries &amp;
Galloway) 69, 72; C Agnew (University of Glasgow) 69, 72.
* GREAT Britain and Ireland defeated the Continent of Europe 9-6 on
Saturday in the Boys' International matches at Dunbar, despite trailing
by 3[1/2]-1[1/2] after the foursomes.
Scots Grant Campbell, of Airdrie, the team captain, Steven Young, of
Inverallochy, and Graham Fox, of West Kilbride, all won their singles,
while Scottish Boys' Strokeplay champion Craig Lee, of Stirling, halved
his match.
They will all now line up at the British Boys' championship, which
begins at the same venue today. Young, the triple Scottish Boys'
champion, will be aiming to add this title which eludes him. Details:
Foursomes -- C Duke and J Little (England) lost to P Touze and O David
(France), 4 and 3; G Campbell and S Young (Scotland) halved with S
Garcia and J Lara (Spain); M Palmer (Wales) and T Rice (Ireland) beat C
Bausek (Austria) and T Schuster (Germany), 2 and 1; C Lee and G Fox
(Scotland) lost to M Hastrup (Denmark) and M Soffietti (Italy), 2 and 1;
D Lucas and L Donald (England) lost to P Davidsson and J Backstrom
(Sweden), 2 and 1.

* COLIN Brooks, of Glencorse, and Cawder assistant Alan Tait shared
top prize in the McIntosh Plant/Newmachar Pro-Am at the north-east
course yesterday.
Both players carded rounds of 71 and 67 for a six-under-par total of
138 to pip Glasgow assistant John Greaves by a stroke, despite his
excellent second-round 66. Leading aggregates:
138 -- C Brooks (Glencorse) 71, 67; A Tait (Cawder) 71, 67. 139 -- J
Greaves (Glasgow) 73, 66. 140 -- D Thomson (Kings Links) 68, 72; R
Arnott (Caddy Shack) 72, 68. 142 -- L Vannet (Carnoustie Golf Links) 68,
74; K Fairbairn (Goswick) 69, 73.
* LOTHIAN Boys defeated Fife Boys by 7[1/2]-2[1/2] at Harburn

DUNCAN Ferguson and Paul McStay are unavailable because of injury, and
mental confusion prevents Andy Goram from pulling on the Scotland
goalkeeper's jersey, but it could have been worse.
The international side's captain Gary McAllister also might have been
no more than an onlooker. McAllister missed Scotland's last European
Championship qualifying tie -- against the Faroe Islands a couple of
months ago -- when he had surgery to repair a hernia problem, but the
Leeds United midfield player was first to report for training at Hampden
on Saturday morning.
There was a brightness about the 30-year-old, who remains the nation's
most accomplished performer. Given the events of the last few days, it
was a relief to see him looking so healthy and eager to get back into
serious competition -- which is exactly what he and the others Craig
Brown will choose for Wednesday night's crucial match against Greece
will experience.
The Greeks flew into Glasgow yesterday afternoon determined to
strengthen their credentials and right to qualify for the European
finals which will be played out in six English grounds next summer, and
a third successive defeat would eliminate them from what has become a
complicated equation.
They know they can't afford to lose at Hampden and the same is true of
Scotland, who must at least do to Greece what they did to us in Athens
last December when they won 1-0.
McAllister, who pales at the thought of his home turf at Elland Road
being one of the main venues for finals which might not include
Scotland, believes the game in Athens was Scotland's worst performance
so far in the qualifying series and it will be oneof his
responsibilities to make sure no one around him is overtaken by
desperation.
''That happened in the last game and I'm sure the Greeks will be
planning to sit back and try to hit us on the break, hoping we will be
rushing all over the place looking for goals,'' McAllister said.
''We will have to be smart about this match and play with
intelligence, while also making sure the Greeks experience a typical
British-type welcome.''
Football intelligence McAllister possess in abundance, and much will
depend on the degree of influence he is able to exert in the midfield
areas. He will be required to orchestrate movement and stretch Greece's
defence, and also find the net, because there is a lack of menace
contained within Scotland's strike force.
As always, Brown has problems, and even though Ally McCoist was
drafted in, the personnel on standby for places are not inspirational.
Darren Jackson, John Robertson, and Duncan Shearer are all good, honest
journeymen whose endeavours don't deserve to be dismissed, but there is
a distinct lack of genuine class at Brown's disposal.
Only Robertson (three goals) and Shearer (two) out of that lot have
scored for the national side, while McAllister has found the net four
times. John Collins is the top scorer with eight goals, in the squad
announced last week and he, too, will be expected to damage the Greeks.
''Most of the experience or caps can be found in our midfield,'' said
McAllister, ''and it will be up to those of us there to make things
happen and, yes, even to score. It is more difficult to score in
international matches, but I think every player should believe he might
score if he is given the chance.''
The game on Wednesday will be McAllister's thirty-fourth in a Scotland
jersey, and despite what players and managers may say about the level of
commitment among today's professionals, he is one of a diminishing breed
of player in that he still feels a sense of pride when he pulls on the
national colours.
He is one of the highest paid players in British football, but still
his desire to play for his country has not been eroded.
''I still get a buzz from it and I still believe it is an honour,'' he
said. ''I have played six games already this close season, but now I'm
anxious to get into a real competitive match -- a game which really
matters, and the rest of the players will be the same.
''This game is the most important one I will have played in for
Scotland, and we must get it right. It is the beginning of a three-game
run, and if we win we could ease ourselves almost into next year's
finals, where I want to be involved as a player and not a steward at
Elland Road.
''Already you can feel the excitment building in England because of
the finals, and there are a lot of good things happening down there with
the grounds which will be used and the talk of build ups. After having
failed to make it to the World Cup finals it is vital that we reach
these finals, especially since the other home nations are struggling to
qualify.''
For a Scot, Irishman or Welshman, playing in England next summer would
be unbearable if England who, as host nation, don't have to qualify,
were to be the only British representatives.
This next game means so much and we will have to stay calm, but up the
tempo so that the Greeks will be uncomfortable and the crowd will feel
we are doing something.
We can't wait for them to inspire us, we must help them, and I think
that if we are being realistic we have enough good players to be able to
beat Greece.
''I sometimes feel the criticism we suffer is excessive, but while we
are not among the elite in international football we should expect to
take care of teams like Greece. I know that recently their teams have
done pretty well while some of ours haven't, but we must be good enough
to beat them.''
''John Collins is top scorer in the squad with eight goals and he,
too, will be expected to inflict damage on the Greeks''

POLAROID (UK) Ltd's first arrival on the Scottish scene in l965 was
part of a well-planned strategy by the American corporation aimed at
establishing a firm presence in Europe, which at that time was reshaping
in commercial terms around EFTA and the Common Market. Choosing Scotland
and Holland gave Polaroid a stake in both groupings and the two
factories are still the group's only two plants in Europe.
''At Vale of Leven we began by manufacturing roll film on a site of
50,000 sq.ft and with a workforce of less than 100,'' said Mike
Fitzpatrick. ''Thirty years on we have a total factory area of more than
360,000 sq.ft and 1300 employees.
''Recognition of the Vale of Leven plant's success came quickly. In
l970 it was awarded the Queen's Award for Export Achievement. This year
that award was achieved for the fifth time. Other awards punctuate the
plant's history at regular intervals. To date it has 11 of the
prestigious annual British Safety Council Sword of Honour awards. Recent
quality accreditation has been achieved in BS5750 and ISO 9002.
Equally telling in its own way, six employees have now achieved 30
years service and 20% of the entire workforce has more than 20 years'
service.
''We have a loyal workforce,'' said Mike Fitzpatrick. ''Throughout our
history we have forged strong links with the local community in many
different ways, community, social and sporting. Employees are
shareholders in the company through an equity participation plan.'' He
himself is closely involved with Dunbartonshire Enterprise Trust.
Product highlights included l972, when sunglass asssembly was started,
and l974, when camera manufacture began with the Polaroid SX7O camera,
the first of a series of major camera manufacture systems to be
launched.
An industrial hardware division was established in l992, to produce
industrial cameras and specialised equipment in the field of electronic
imaging.
Recent and major production developments have included robotic
assembly being introduced in the camera division, the launch of a new
Polahybrid enhanced colour system and the launch of the award winning
Microcam scientific camera.
The steady forward growth has continued this year with Polaroid's 636
Autofocus and Talking Camera models and the introduction of new Xoor
sunglass lenses.
Achieving a #207m turnover last year, representing l5% of the Polaroid
Corporation's total turnover, the Scottish factory's management team is
the first to agree that their steady story of success and development is
one which will come as a surprise to most outsiders.
In a birthday greeting sent from the United States by Joseph R
Oldfield, the Corporation's executive vice-president for photographic
imaging, a particular compliment is paid to the years which have passed.
''Throughout this effort and in the years to come, our Vale of Leven
facility has and will play a leadership role in strengthening and
improving our manufacturing processes and product quality and
reliability. In today's highly complex competitive global economy,
Polaroid's Scottish facility remains the single largest manufacturing
source for cameras for shipment to markets world-wide -- a record we are
both proud of and confident will help lead us into the next century.''

POLAROID (UK), exports to more than 100 countries, with Europe and the
US accounting for 88% of its market.
The products concerned are used in a variety of ways, including
national identity and driving licence programmes. Another use has been
in identity programmes in Angola and in Mozambique prior to elections.
Often specific market needs have to be taken into account. The
Industrial Hardware division discovered that while German dentists
frequently ordered cameras to be used in photographing patients' teeth,
the same dentists wanted the cameras to be grey in colour, to match
their regular dental surgery equipment, rather than in the black in
which it had been supplied. The change was immediately carried out.
The Industrial Hardware division at Vale of Leven is one of the
smaller divisions in the Polaroid (UK) operation. But in Industrial
Hardware and Electronic Imaging the overall results are important beyond
mere size as they mainly involve the scientific, medical, technical and
professional imaging field.
In forensic medicine, crime scenes and the recording of evidence
requires a good quality image quickly. In professional photography and
particularly in a studio environment a good quality image is required
within a few seconds to allow the photographer to gauge composition and
lighting before commencing shooting with a portrait-standard camera.
As a third example, the electronics industry frequently require good
quality instant photographs. These can vary from use for documentation
purposes in wafer fabrication to defect analysis in printed circuit
board manufacture.
The name Polaroid has become equally linked with high quality sunglass
lenses with the ability to filter out specific light and give particular
clarity of vision.
Base material for the lenses comes in large rolls of material from the
United States -- base material so delicate that it must be used within
three months of arriving at Vale of Leven.
The process that follows begins by cutting the material into size and
form to fit the frame. The correct optical curve is then created using a
unique Polaroid press polishing process . . . the original process on
which the Polaroid empire was first built.
Today the Vale of Leven plant is the only supplier of Polaroid lenses
in the world.
There are four different colours and six size choices available and
each lens must undergo inspection with both transmitted and reflected
light. That in itself is a major task when Polaroid (UK) expect to make
more than six million pairs of lenses each year.
Teams of specially trained inspectors check each stage from the start
of manufacturing through to the packaging of the final approved lens.
Finished lenses are mainly sent to the Far East to be glazed and placed
in frames.
The next stage in Polaroid sunglasses is already under way. A new
sunglass lens product, known as XooR, is already under development. As
protective as the current material, it is claimed to give even better
optical performance combined with new standards of lightweight, strength
and durability.
Two distinct types of ''instant'' film are manufactured at the Vale of
Leven plant. The most familiar is the version that appears from the
bottom of a Polaroid camera when a photograph has been taken and then
develops as you watch.
The other, which has been manufactured at Vale of Leven for some 30
years, is mainly put to professional and specialist use. Known as ''peel
apart'' film, it involves a developing period after which the negative
is peeled away from the positive to reveal the developed photograph.
Key photographic materials used in the process are Polaroid
technologies and are manufactured and sent to Scotland from sister
companies in the US and in Holland. Once the film has been assembled in
Scotland and packed it is then shipped for use throughout the world.
Demand has meant that production volume has increased by almost 45%
since l945. More than 75% of total production is now supplied from
Scotland.
In all of this, Mike Fitzpatrick as director of manufacturing and
development sees a clear way ahead in terms of Polaroid (UK) and the
future. At his desk in his Vale of Leven office he said: ''In Scotland
we are uniquely placed as a Polaroid plant. We have an outstanding base
on which to build for a successful future. As Polaroid increasingly
becomes a global company we are actively working on establishing a
product development capacity here in Scotland.
''In the future we can compete through strengthening our technical
base and providing a level of capability and responsiveness to Polaroid
not available elsewhere in the world.
''We see Scotland continuing its present role as the managing centre
for manufacturing operations in China, Russia and Mexico and extending
this role as other nations emerge.''
Much of the credit for Polaroid (UK) success at Vale of Leven he
attributes to what he describes as ''the very special culture we have
created here''.
''We have long taken for granted practices and behaviours which would
be regarded as quite progressive and enlightened by many companies.
Quite simply, we believe in participation and involvement in the way we
work together.
''Ours is a team culture where we involve people in continuous
improvement programmes aimed at satisfying our customers. We use regular
meetings to let everyone know what is happening within the business.''
Polaroid operate an equity participation plan and a profit sharing
scheme. One result of this, he admits, is that he frequently gets first
news of stock price movements while out on the shop floor.

Polaroid opened its factory at Vale of Leven 30 years ago, and this
month it marks the occasion with a party for its employees and guests.
Bill Knox reports
BIRTHDAY celebrations are under way at one of Scotland's major and yet
relatively unknown success stories, the Polaroid (UK) Ltd factory at
Vale of Leven. Thirty years old this month, the factory marked the
occasion on Saturday with a party for more than 3000 guests -- workers
and families joined by VIP, civic and corporate representatives from
home and abroad. Bands played, there were sideshows and balloons, games
and entertainment, and a general good time was had by all.
How else do you mark a birthday for what is regarded as the largest
film and camera manufacturing plant in Europe, exporting to more than
100 countries? ''One in every nine cameras currently produced in the
world comes from our factory,'' said Mike Fitzpatrick, director of
manufacturing and development. ''Ninety per cent of our sales are export
revenue. Today we produce some four million consumer cameras and some 40
million packs of film each year as well as products for use in the
fields of medicine, science and technology. We are also the sole
manufacturers of Polaroid sunglass lenses.'' Even against the background
of birthday celebrations the Vale of Leven plant management team is
working hard on planning the way ahead for the next 30 years. They have
positive targets.
''As management team and workforce we plan to become one of the
up-front players in the Polaroid group,'' said Mike Fitzpatrick. ''We
are already a vibrant part of the Polaroid world-wide community.
The future will not just be based on the traditional skills we have
had before, but on a new set of skills which we will have acquired. We
have the responsibility to identify and develop these.'' Emphasising
that their products are not just ''holiday snap'' cameras but are used
in business, the professions, medicine and electronics, he sees the Vale
plan as vital in terms of translating research into saleable products.
''Our aim is to play a larger and major role in what will be
world-wide product development of an increasingly higher technical
nature, an onward and upward situation.'' Polaroid praise what they
describe as the ''special atmosphere'' that has developed among the
workforce and see it as part of the reason for the plant's overall
success. It is regarded as certain to become even more important in the
new products and markets ahead, the latter mapped as including the
Pacific Rim countries, Eastern Europe, Africa and Central America.
''We see the future as one in which intellectual knowledge will play
an even more important role. Quality of knowledge and quality of
training will be vital,'' said Alasdair Liddell, manager for strategy
and quality. ''The products of the future will be much more complex, the
skills need will be much more judgmental.
''Go back five years or so and what we had was more of a screwdriver
type of operation with efficiency training. We did not have a
particularly high proportion of graduate employees. But that has now
changed. The future demands higher levels of technology and we will
recruit at higher and graduate levels to match.'' A determined pursuit
of quality has deep roots in Polaroid history at Vale of Leven,
including a Total Quality programme with Awareness Training which
commenced for every employee in l992.
''Apart from an aim to be the outstanding centre of excellence within
the Polaroid Corporation's global operation, we aim to also be the best
company in Scotland in the primary areas of manufacturing and
innovation.'' Costs are among specific targets being tackled. The
continuing intention is to reduce total production costs by two to four
per cent each year through better operating efficiency.
''In quality we have achieved a 3O% improvement each year for the past
four years,'' said Alasdair Liddell. ''In that period we have moved from
tackling identified defects to improving total quality.''
Another area where targets have been met is in improving the general
plant environment. When specific surveys proved that much of waste
material collected in the plant came from the packaging of material sent
by the firm's suppliers, positive steps were taken including contacting
the suppliers concerned, asking them to either reduce or change the
nature of the packing involved.
Results have been surprisingly effective with improvements in
materials and quantities used and in increased opportunities for
recycling.
''We know above all that people are surprised to learn that we are the
only camera manufacturing plant in Europe,'' said Mike Fitzpatrick. ''In
fact, more cameras are now exported from the Vale of Leven than the
total number of cameras imported into the UK from all world-wide
manufacturers.
''These cameras range from low-cost 'fun' cameras to advanced products
involving advanced technology for many important scientific, medical,
and industrial applications. We also handle a large share of Polaroid's
consumer camera and pull-apart film business along with Polaroid lens
manufacture. The growth areas of industrial hardware and electronic
imaging now include much work which until only about 18 months ago was
carried out in the United States.'' Thirty years ago, when Polaroid
first arrived at Vale of Leven, no-one would have suggested it might
grow to become, as it is today, the largest private sector employer in
the whole Dumbarton area. But one reason for that choice remains equally
valid today.
''We have an excellent location via the Erskine Bridge for both
passenger and air freight connections at Glasgow and Prestwick airports.
We are close to the motorway network and rail links. The Clyde is on our
doorstep and we also use sea freight.
''These are assets in what we plan as our future role -- and as far as
possible we want our future to be in our own hands.''

POLAROID'S strong links with local communities begin with supporting
many charity activities and go on to include backing the Polaroid 10K
Road Race series, regarded as one of the premier road race series in
Scotland.
Among charities, the West of Scotland Downs Syndrome Association
receives strong support for its annual visit to the outward bound centre
near Fort William.
In a wider field, the company is one of the group of local industries
and education figures who come together in the Educational and Business
Partnership, whose aim is to promote better understanding between
schools and industry. One aspect is to explain to young people the
career opportunities that are available within a modern factory
environment.
They also join with other local companies in the Young Enterprise
scheme, which gives school pupils aged between l5 and l9 the opportunity
to run their own business in miniature from directors and share issues
to producing financial accounts and a company report.
THE Japanese paper folding art of ''origami'' has been put to
ingenious use in Polaroid's search to improve its packing methods at the
same time as it reduces waste.
Seeking a better method of packing cameras for despatch to export
markets, a company team came across a suggestion from origami
approaches. The net result was a box which could hold four cameras with
dividing walls of packaging where in the past four separate boxes had
been used.

WESTERN UNION
WEST of Scotland continued to make city rivals Clydesdale wait for
their first D M Hall Western Union title in 15 years when they routed
bottom club Uddingston at Hamilton Crescent on Saturday.
Now the top two are on a collision course next Saturday, when they
meet at Titwood, and although Clydesdale remain firmly in pole position,
they know they can take nothing for granted.
A 45-minute delay at the start only put off the inevitable for
Uddingston and sure enough, when the action got under way, their
fragility at the crease was evident once more.
Without George Reifer, who was with Scotland in Ireland, resistance
was limited and the innings closed at 119.
That was a simple task as far as the hosts were concerned. Former
Scotland skipper Alastair Storie dominated with an unbeaten 76 and West
went past the required number of runs with seven wickets still standing.
Clydesdale, the league leaders, also began late and their match with
Ferguslie at Meikleriggs was also deferred until half an hour later in
the day. Even so, Clydesdale were not about to let the Paisley climate
threaten their title quest.
Their professional, Aamir Hanif, is intent on winning the championship
in his debut season in the Western Union and he led by example. As
Clydesdale made 226 for five, he hit ten 4s and a 6 in a chanceless 143,
and he received good support from Donald Orr, who added 61.
In response, the home batsmen were never up to the rate and settled
for the draw early on. Mike Pawson, their Kiwi pro, top-scored with 36,
but Hanif was again the best Clydesdale performer, grabbing three for
51. His efforts were not sufficient to secure victory, however, as
Ferguslie held out for a share of the points at 121-7.
Meanwhile, Poloc's wafer-thin chances of landing the title finally
cracked at Shawholm, where they were narrowly beaten by Ayr. David
Simpson made a fine 83 from the opener's slot for the Cambusdoon men,
but when they were all back in the pavilion for 156 Poloc must have
fancied their chances.
This was to be one of those rare occasions, however, when Sajid Ali
misfired.
He went for 15, and only skipper Brian Spence, who made 60, was able
to cope with the Ayr attack as the Glasgow side fell eight runs short of
the visiting total.
While West were looking at their most potent ahead of this weekend's
Whyte and Mackay Scottish Cup final on their own ground, the other
finalists, Drumpellier, crashed to a heavy defeat against Kelburne at
Langloan.
Cricket was probably the last thing on anyone at the home club's mind
after news came through from Dublin of the sudden death of Hugh
Stevenson, the SCU vice-chairman.
His son, Alan, flew to Ireland immediately and, indeed, only 10 of
Drumpellier's senior players were available to play with a junior
drafted in.
Raising morale in those circumstances was as difficult as raising a
team had been and, despite rolling the Paisley side over for only 104,
the visitors' attack accounted for all of the Drumpellier batsmen --
minus the youngster who did not bat -- for a mere 61 runs.
Apart from that brief match, late finishes were the order of the day
on Saturday. Greenock's woeful run continued although they did hang on
in the end for a draw with Kilmarnock NK at Glenpark.
Pakistani Test player Asif Mujtaba was again the saviour of the
Kilmarnock innings, fashioning an excellent 93 off just 104 balls before
he was caught in the gully. Veterans Tom Black and Peter Duthie both
took three wickets for the home side.
When Greenock's turn to bat came, they never looked like reaching
their target in among the showers and by the time the full 100 overs had
been played it was getting dark.
Kilmarnock were not too far from taking full points themselves, but in
the end the home side clawed their way to 142 for eight.

WASIM Akram produced an inspired all-round performance to guide
Lancashire to a four-wicket victory at Leicestershire on Saturday. Wasim
completed his second six-wicket haul of the match -- six for 93 to go
with his first-innings six for 72 -- as Lancs, in fourth place going
into the match, dismissed the home side for 282 after they had resumed
on 157 for four.
As the Lancashire batsmen slipped to 162 for six in the chase for 215
to win, Wasim weighed in with a superb unbeaten 50 to seal victory
within three days.
Warwickshire kept up their push for a second successive title with an
innings victory over Hampshire at Southampton. The champions declared
their first innings on 535 for eight, with captain Dermot Reeve unbeaten
on 77, leaving Hampshire in need of 310 just to avoid an innings defeat.
Openers Paul Terry (46) and Jason Laney (61) frustrated Warwickshire
for a while, putting on 111 for the first wicket. But off-spinner Neil
Smith took six for 72 in 33.2 overs and paceman Allan Donald two for 50
to dismiss Hampshire for 221 and clinch a maximum-points victory by an
innings and 89 runs.
Mushtaq Ahmed took six for 38 in the second innings against Kent to
spin Somerset to an eight-wicket victory at Taunton.

EAST LEAGUE:
THERE was just one over to come at Myreside and Edinburgh Academicals
needed three runs for victory over Watsonians, but they had only one
wicket in hand. Andy Mason was bowling to Dave Brydon, who drove with a
mighty thump. It looked for all the world like the winning boundary
until veteran Tim Bunker jack-knifed to his left and clung on to a
marvellous low catch.
Poor Accies. They deserved more from a game in which fortunes
see-sawed all day.
Watsonians were put in on a capricious wicket which makes Steve
Lockhart's 63 out of an opening stand of 87 all the more admirable. He
hit twelve 4s in a top-notch innings.
His partner, Malcolm Heggie, had eight 4s in a knock of 43, during
which he was struck on the helmet by a flier. Accies' Keith Dyer was a
later casualty, when he gloved a rearing ball into his face, having
unfortunately ventured forth without any head protection against West
Indian John Pollard.
At 148 for four, a substantial total for 'Sonians looked probable, but
a middle-order collapse scuppered their prospects and they were all out
for 184 in the forty-eighth over. Craig Symon had figures of six for 72
from 24 overs.
The response was sensible as Accies made progress by taking runs off
the occasional loose ball. Dave Hill, Dougie Ferguson, Willie Tait, and
Stuart Moffat all batted attractively and all got out when set.
Then they, too, surrendered a flurry of quick wickets as Symon, Dave
Loudon and the unfortunate Dyer all came and went. This left too much
for Geoff Mawdesley to do on his own and he lost his off stick to
Pollard trying to force the pace, one of seven victims for the home pro
from his 25 overs.
There was a tight finish, too, at Golden Acre, where Grange's last
pair denied Heriot's a record 13 wins in a row. Steve Thomson scored a
century for the champions and Shahid Aslam had another fine all-round
outing with 48 runs and six wickets from 26 overs.
But the focus is now firmly on the bottom of the Ryden East League and
Royal High find themselves in real difficulty following a home drubbing
at the hands of Freuchie. Their meagre take of three points was reduced
to one on account of their slow over rate, inexcusable in the
circumstances.
They are now ominously close to Falkland, who came away from
Corstorphine with the better of the draw after another thriller. The
home side, at one point 22 for four, rallied to 143 for nine, thanks
mainly to Allan Speirs.
Falkland, too, were in dire straits at 31 for five, but a fine
partnership between Alan Hamilton and Darren Hogg in the teeth of
extremely hostile bowling from Shahid Saeed added 70. The last two overs
yielded the 14 runs necessary to tip the balance the Fifers way.
Stenhousemuir had Peter Gardiner back in their line-up in the absense
of Iain Philip, but their match with Carlton at The Tryst finished in a
draw. Incidently, Carlton's professional Robin Singh has an attractive
benefit match lined up at Grange Loan on Wednesday afternoon.

JOHN Cleland improved his overall lead in the Auto Trader RAC British
Touring Car Championship at Brands Hatch yesterday with victory in the
second of the day's two races.
Having earlier finished third behind Will Hoy and Rickard Rydell in
round 18 of the championship, the Scot left the Kent circuit with a
40-point advantage over Swede Rydell in the drivers' championship.
The first of the day's two 30-lap sprints was effectively decided on
the opening lap as Hoy outdragged front-row men Cleland and Rydell on
the run-up to the Druids hairpin.
It was a masterly manoeuvre from the Renault driver and he was quick
to capitalise on his advantage, pulling out a healthy lead that,
although reduced to less than half a second by the time the chequered
flag fell, was never seriously challenged.
It was Hoy's first win for the Renault team and his first BTCC race
victory since 1992, when he drove for Toyota.
Rydell was Hoy's closest rival, the Volvo man muscling past Cleland's
Vauxhall for second place on the opening lap. Cleland had made the
better start of the pair as, once again, Rydell failed to take advantage
of pole position.
Once through, Rydell was not to be robbed of it by Cleland, who stuck
to the Volvo's boot lid throughout. Hoy's Renault team-mate, Alain Menu,
was fourth, making up for the disadvantage of a seventh-slot grid
position with a fine start and early fight past BMW's Johnny Cecotto.
Rydell made no mistake second time around, leading from pole -- his
eleventh of the season -- to head Cleland and Hoy on the first lap. The
Swede built up a healthy lead, but by lap 12 Clelland was on the Volvo's
tail with Hoy in close attendance.
Entering Clearways for the fifteenth time, Rydell lost the line, was
nudged from behind by Cleland, and half-spun out of the lead. Cleland
seized the opportunity to head into a lead he was never to lose, with
Hoy following through to assume second place.
Rydell was fortunate to restart in third place, and he finished well
ahead of reigning champion Gabriele Tarquini. Results:
Round 18: 1, W Hoy (GB), Renault Laguna, 23min 51.57sec; 2, R Rydell
(Sweden), Volvo 850 20v, +0.46; 3, J Cleland (GB), Vauxhall Cavalier

EQUITY AND LAW LEAGUE
KENT'S hopes of landing the AXA Equity and Law League title were given
a massive lift as they secured a nine-wicket success over Somerset,
while rivals Essex and Lancashire both suffered defeats.
Sri Lankan batsman Arivinda de Silva was the architect of the victory
which lifts Kent into joint first place with Essex on 38 points, hitting
an unbeaten 105 as his side cruised past Somerset's 166 for seven with
10.5 overs to spare at Taunton.
De Silva joined opener Trevor Ward (52no) for an unbroken
second-wicket stand of 169 after the visitors had lost Matthew Fleming
for a duck.
Somerset were always struggling after having been reduced to 18 for
five, but Graham Rose rescued them from total humiliation with a gritty
knock of 59, while Mark Ealham finished with four for 21.
Graham Gooch hit 69 in Essex's total of 236 for nine but hosts
Glamorgan kept their nerve to win by four wickets at Pontypridd, thanks
to an overthrow off the penultimate ball.
Hugh Morris (86) and Steve James (40) gave Glamorgan a fine start with
an opening stand of 133, Matthew Maynard weighed in with 54 as the Welsh
county bounced back into the title reckoning. They now lie joint fourth
in the table, four points off the pace.
Lancashire's clash with Leicestershire at Grace Road was ''replayed''
after the pitch was declared dangerous by the umpires with the home side
on 35 for one.
Lancashire batted first on the newly-prepared strip and made 198 for
seven, Jason Gallian top-scoring with 51, but it was not enough to
prevent a six-wicket setback which sees them drop to sixth.
Vince Wells, who took three for 31 for Leicestershire, pepped their
innings with a knock of 40 after they had slipped to 32 for two, and
South African Hansie Cronje secured victory with 93 not out off just 89
balls as the home side reached their target in the thirty-sixth over.
Champions Warwickshire moved to third, just two points adrift of Essex
and Kent, with a 67-run victory over Hampshire at Southampton, where
Neil Smith (55) and Dominic Ostler (44) shared a second-wicket stand of
98 before skipper Dermot Reeve (50) pushed the visitors to 226 for
seven.

RUGBY LEAGUE
WAKEFIELD Trinity's powerful 20-year-old centre Lee Child scored two
well taken tries as Ireland beat Scotland at the Royal Dublin Showground
yesterday in the first full rugby league international between the two
countries.
The speedy Child grabbed the first following a sensational 80-yard
dash down the touchline, and the last of his side's four tries, in the
26-22 victory.
Scotland registered the same number of touchdowns as the home team,
but only got three goals through Halifax forward Martin Ketteridge,
while Irish full-back Ian Devery kicked five goals in an extremely
competitive encounter.
Ireland led just 8-2 at half-time, -- each half lasted 35 minutes --
but the points flowed freely in the second period with the lead changing
hands several times.
Child went over for his second from 30 yards near the end, to put the
game beyond the reach of Scotland who had the last word through winger
Gavin Manclark's second try of the match.
Scotland's other tryscorers were Sean Cusack and Huddersfield's Kiwi
centre Darrall Shelford, while Featherstone prop Leo Casey and Leeds
hooker Seamus McCallion touched down for the home side in between
Child's golden double.
Both sides fielded a mixture of both amateur and professional league
players, plus some from the union ranks, in this curtain-raiser to the
Charity Shield between Wigan and Leeds.

* PAT Eddery made a profitable comeback after his latest suspension
when Danehill Dancer landed a major gamble for owner Michael Tabor in
the Heinz Phoenix Stakes at Leopardstown yesterday.
Backed down from 4-1 to 2-1, Danehill Dancer hit the front more than a
furlong out and despite showing signs of inexperience held fellow
English raider Woodborough by a neck to give trainer Neville Callaghan a
tremendous boost.
''This is the first real race the horse has had. He will have one more
run, possibly back in Ireland in the National Stakes, before we put him
away until next year. He looks like a three-year-old already,'' said the
Irish-born Newmarket trainer.
A bargain at only 38,000 guineas and purchased for Monte Carlo-based
Tabor by Irish vet Demi O'Byrne, Danehill Dancer was driven by Eddery to
tackle and pass the front-running Sunset Reigns and Woodborough inside
the two-furlong marker and favourite backers were already counting their
winnings before John Reid rallied Woodborough to close the deficit from
the best part of a length to a neck in the last 100 yards.

ROGER Charlton's stable is firing again after a 20-day, 22-runner
winnerless spell.
The Beckhampton trainer ended the drought when Cap Juluca and Didina
won last Friday and a near 35-1 double at Kempton yesterday with
Monument (10-1) and Mystic Hill (9-4) made it four winners for the yard
in three racing days.
After Monument, ridden by Tim Sprake, had won the Knowle Green Maiden
Stakes by a head from Raise The Stakes, the 11-10 favourite, the
stewards called an inquiry into the winner's improvement on his previous
run at Sandown where he had finished thirteenth of 15.
They accepted the explanation of Charlton's assistant, Julian
Smyth-Osbourne, who told them that the gelding had pulled very hard
going to post at Sandown and then appeared to resent being settled in,
whereas yesterday he was more settled and appreciated a smaller field of
runners.
Mystic Hill, Artic Courier, and Major Change flashed past the post
locked together in the Nimbus Races Stakes and they finished in that
order, separated by a short head and a head.
The Charlton gelding, a son of Derby hero Shirley Heights, had a
tremendous battle with the other two but held on under inspired driving
from Richard Quinn.

HAMILTON Park has become a happy hunting ground for Nornax Lad, who
has won on his last two visits from Martyn Meade's Wiltshire yard.
The seven-year-old son of Northern Baby attempts to make it three wins
from three consecutive runs in less than a fortnight when he lines up
for the Carstairs Apprentices' Handicap.
There are three runners for this race over a mile-and-a-half and
Nornax Lad should have no trouble in accounting for Exclusion, a
disappointing sixth at Catterick last month and Lord Advocate, who seems
to have lost his form since his two successes on this track earlier in
the season.
Linda Perratt and Robert McKellar have been remarkably successful at
Hamilton in recent weeks and both Scottish trainers will have high
expectations in the Team Management Handicap.
Diet won the Arthur Balding Handicap here 11 days ago but was badly
hampered when struck by stable companion Mr Westsound at Ayr two days
later.
The old boy from Cree Lodge is having a great season and cannot be
discounted.
McKellar's Suedoro weakened into fourth place in Diet's race but the
five-year-old has won twice over this course and distance and must have
a chance.
However, Mark Johnston's Baileys Sunset will be hard to beat.
The five-year-old won a seller at Brighton two weeks ago and another
seller at Ayr earlier in July and is handicapped to win in this class.
Jack Berry's Moi Canard, who won the Hyndford Claiming Stakes on
Wednesday surviving both an objection and a stewards' inquiry, returns
for the Rosebank Claiming Stakes.
There are only four runners and Chestnut Colt should be good enough to
see off Ultra Barley, who won on the all-weather Wolverhampton recently.
Nose Nobounds, third to Crackernat at York on his first run is like to
improve sufficiently to take the Silverwell House Maiden Stakes from
Larghetto, runner-up in three of his past four races.

LEN Lungo, first winner of The Herald Leading Scottish National Hunt
Trainer award with 28 winners, has been busy over the summer preparing a
package of surprises for the new season.
The package contains more than 20 new horses which have not been seen
on a racecourse before, he revealed yesterday at his Carrutherstown
yard.
Not usually given to making exuberant claims about the future fortunes
of his horses, Lungo said: ''I am really excited about the new season
and am looking forward to it more than any before.
Although the last two seasons, with 27 and 28 winners, have been good,
this could be even better.''
He will have 35 horses in training at Hetlandhill, slightly less than
last time, including old favourite Attadale, a top-class hurdler who
goes novice chasing, Noyan and Oat Couture, who won three times, and
Forbidden Time and Santa Concerto, successful twice.
Although he expects all five to do well, the reason for his excitement
is centred around the newcomers to his string.
He was ''round Ireland twice'' during the off season in search of
young talent, and purchased a total of 13, of which 12 are unraced.
In addition, he has several ''store horses'' who have been nursed
along patiently over the last two or three years.
Lungo has had a clearout, selling about 20 of last season's horses to
make room for the new faces. ''It is a real challenge to have so many
newcomers in the yard. They will run in bumpers and novice hurdles later
in the year,'' he added.
Although the season proper starts with a two-day meeting at Perth on
Friday and Saturday, Lungo will not be represented.
''I intend to wait until the ground eases. It could be as late as the
end of October before the majority of my horses have their first run.''
Perth, voted Small Racecourse of the Year in Scotland and the North of
England by the Racegoers Club, has been watered night and day for the
past seven weeks, according to Sam Morshead, clerk of the course.
Unless there is a lot of rain, the ground will still be fast, and most
Scottish trainers are expected to wait until the last possible moment
before deciding to run their early-season horses.
Tom Dyer likes to support his local course and could have four runners
on Friday. He will walk the course on Thursday.
Dyer, who has 20 boxes at his Balruddery yard at Invergowrie, has
planning permission in for 20 more and an equine swimming pool.
He aims to compete on the same level as Lungo in future years, but,
for the present, will be satisfied to get into double figures.
High earning Chief Minister, who won the Swinton Hurdle at Haydock,
worth more than #23,500, may soon revert to novice chasing.
With the advent of summer jumping, the season started back in June. So
far, Tom Kemp has two winners and Peter Monteith, runner-up to Lungo,
one.

I LOVE cheese. It is a love affair which goes back a long time and is
now increasingly a cause of some domestic tension. The health police
seem to be particularly disapproving of cheese, citing it as a cause of
obesity and , therefore, heart disease. I am not obese, but with very
little effort I could be.
My rate of consumption has decreased in recent years, mainly through
my wife's policy of buying cheese in small amounts and making
disapproving noises if she ever catches me actually eating any. If it
were not for the fact that our son is also very fond of cheese, I doubt
if any would be brought into the house at all. Sons are something to be
cherished.
Away from home I am inclined to indulge myself. If, at any function
the double-cream Caboc is on the cheeseboard I will certainly have my
fair share. Never mind the last Rollo, I will be back for the last piece
of Caboc. The calory count must be fantastic -- and if it isn't I hope
someone will write and tell me, so that I can frame the letter.
I ascribe my love of cheese to my Fife mining pedigree. My father, and
both grandfathers, worked underground, and cheese was a favourite in the
piece box. I am told that the miners' fondness for cheese comes from the
fact that it retains its flavour underground, while meat becomes
unpalatable.
With that kind of background I could not fail to be interested in
Cheesemaking in Scotland, published by the Scottish Dairy Association.
The whole story is here, from the early Dunlop farmhouse cheeses to the
modern plant of today churning out vast quantities for the supermarkets.
The author, John Smith, is himself an experienced cheesemaker --
formerly a senior executive with Unigate but now retired and living in
Wiltshire. The book is the result of three years' detailed research and
is a serious work, although it does have its lighter moments.
One of these involves the reproduction (in an appendix lest it should
offend the more genteel souls among us) of a slightly bawdy poem written
by a Campbeltown bank manager in praise of Islay cheese. This followed
an import ban imposed by the Italians, many years ago, because the
island product was believed to have aphrodisiac properties. I quote the
final three verses:
An old and shaking Genoese,
His pension was collecting,
Ate just one bite of Islay cheese,
And now his wife's expecting.
He chews a chunk and softly sighs
''How I love this glorious cheesa''
Looks up aloft and loudly cries,
''Get up them stairs Theresa''.
The old wife prays upon her knees
''O Lord refrain his sallies'',
And from the awful Islay Cheese
Protect us poor old ''Tallies''.
For those of us who are more interested in eating cheese than in
studying its history, the best chapter in this book is the one devoted
to soft and speciality cheese.
Here we can read of the Howgate range and the Ingle Smoke House at
Perth. Humphrey Errington, famous for his Lanark Blue and Dunsyre Blue,
is also mentioned.
The Lanark Blue is made from unpasteurised sheep's milk, adopting a
method similar to that used in France to produce Roquefort. The Dunsyre
Blue uses milk from Ayrshire cows grazed at about 1000 feet above sea
level.
Traditional farmhouse cheddars are made yet on the Isle of Mull,
filled into cloth-bound cylinders and matured for six to nine months on
turning bales in a store at the local distillery.
The classic Dunlop cheese is still produced at West Clerkland farm,
only a stone's throw away from The Hill Farm which was home to Barbara
Gilmour, who is credited as the 17th century originator of Dunlop
cheese. She is said to have introduced the method from Ireland.
There is, of course, a counter-theory which says that the Cunningham
area already had an excellent reputation for both butter and cheese long
before the appearance of Barbara Gilmour -- who was the wife of John
Dunlop of Hill Farm.
Supporters of that theory will argue that the cheese takes its name
not from Mrs Dunlop (Barbara Gilmour) but from a trader who lived in the
parish of Dunlop and supplied cheese to markets in Glasgow.
The importance of cheesemaking in the rural economy of Scotland -- and
of south-west Scotland in particular, is recorded in some detail. Until
the start of the industrial revolution in central Scotland, the main
cash crop of farms in the upper Clyde valley around Liberton, Lamington
and Dunsyre was sheep's milk cheese.

A BATTERY of economic statistics this week will give the first clues
about the performance of the economy in the second quarter.
The indicator of the week could well turn out to be retail sales, due
on Wednesday. Sales have been lack-lustre in recent months, but the CBI
distributive trades survey has raised hopes of an increase in July,
helped by the good weather.
Economists at James Capel are looking for a 0.4% gain last month. This
would leave year-on-year growth down from 1.1% in June to 1%.
July's unemployment figures are also due on Wednesday. The rate at
which unemployment has been falling has been slowing down sharply this
year. In June the seasonally adjusted drop was just 4200.
This raises the possibility that unemployment will actually have risen
last month for the first time since 1993. Average earnings figures for
June are expected to be unchanged from May's 3.75%.
On Thursday July's Retail Price Index is expected to fall on the back
of discounting in the summer sales. Capel does not think discounting has
been as deep as last year.
It is forecasting a 0.4% month-on-month decline in all measures of
inflation. This would result in the annual rate ticking up from 3.5% to
3.6% on the headline measure. Underlying inflation would be 2.9% (2.8%)
and the Bank of England's much favoured RPIY rate 2.4% (2.3%).
Producer price data for July due later today could show that the
pressure on input prices is easing. Capel expects no change from June,
which would allow the annual rate to fall back from 10.2% in June to
8.9%.
Factory gate price inflation will continue to edge up. Output prices
are expected to rise by 0.2% with the result that the annual rate would
increase from 4.2% in June to 4.4%.
July is one of the three main months in the year for the collection of
corporation tax. This makes the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, due
on Wednesday, notoriously difficult to forecast. Capel has hopes that it
will fall to around #1000m.
Money supply figures on Friday are expected to show a recovery in M4
lending from #1700m in June to #3500m. Broad M4 would rise by 0.6% and
the annual rate edge lower from 6.7% in June to 6.6%.

INITIAL disappointments with low bushel weights have all been blown
away. Weights are generally down but the moistures are so low and the
cutting has been so easy that 1995 will be remembered as one of the good
harvest for winter barley.
It has even been too hot for some. The Red Rooster's fans in the
combine have been giving him trouble. In those 80-degree days his cab
has been like a sauna. So it wasn't just his hair that was bright red.
That was until he could stand it no longer and tried to drive with the
door open. Any other year, with the grain coming in at 20% that would
have worked well, but with the grain in the low teens the dust and awns
stuck to the sweat and produced a curious stubbly yellow Rooster in
extreme discomfort.
And it all came on so quickly we were taken quite unawares. The worst
case was Mains who doesn't need to dry barley in a normal year because
he has one of those blue grain storage towers. All his barley goes in
there to feed his bulls through the winter. The bulls prefer the grain
to be moist and it doesn't go off because the airtight container keeps
the bugs quiet.
But Mains was too late this year. He found himself putting barley at
13% into his moist grain tower. When Mossie heard about that he took on
a grave look. ''You're taking a bit of a risk, aren't you Mains? Should
you nae have popcorned it jist tae be sure?''
That would be as bad as having paper plates, a dishwasher and an au
pair girl.
I fear I am in dire trouble with my honorary consultant. I know the
rules and yet I have broken them. I am not allowed to have bigger yields
than the master and yet I have one field which has yielded 81 cwts at
13%. Or four tonnes three cwts at 15%.
That is the greatest cereal yield we have ever had and it was with
barley after wheat. The field which has a very good southerly exposure
was for many years in grass and had a great crop of wheat last year.
The yield was spoiled at the last minute when it got droughted and
burned.
You may not remember but last year I just managed my first ever
four-tonne crop. Well, both were grown with Pleasante, a six-rowed
barley which is generally thought to be past its time. Indeed, I had the
greatest difficulty getting any last year.
And such is the fame of my Pleasante at that I am inundated with
requests for some for seed. However, I just cannot understand all that
stuff that has been coming out recently about royalties so I'm just not
interested. I might just keep a wee bit back for myself, mind.
I don't have an overall figure yet but yields range down to three
tonnes five so I can't complain. Mossie's average is three tonnes nine
so, if I can sneak my average in below that, he may yet be persuaded to
stay on as adviser.
So it is going well but in the rush there have been some tense moments
-- like Mossie and the Red Rooster and their partnership in the swather.
The wonder is that the partnership has worked for so long. The Rooster
does all the work. At least he provides the excellent driver who manages
only to damage two rows at each end of the bouts. When the driver gets
tired, at about midnight, the Rooster takes over and, depending on how
much there is to do, he might drive all night.
The Rooster's father then sends out the invoices or even better calls
round with them and gets the money in. The Rooster's mother has to cope
with all the aggravation from those waiting in the swather queue.
Mossie, on the other hand, is the thinking drinking-partner. While the
hash is on he is in the pub blowing to all who will listen that he is
finished. ''Oh dear me! You're nae finished? Canna get a swather? Leave
it tae me.'' Then he gets on his mobile and tells the Rooster's mum to
tell the Rooster to get his tail over to the Barnyards and cut another
50 acres. ''Aye that's all fixed -- I'll have another pint.''
You can see the potential for strain, I'm sure.
And I had one of those moments of extreme embarrassment unknown to
farmers of my father's generation. They had staff on the farms then.
Mains was combining and the Wasting Asset, despite his hangover, was
just about managing to cope with driving off the grain. I was loading an
artic. Now the only way we can handle these monsters is to load them on
the road. With my old digger it takes me forty-five minutes and in that
time no one gets in or out.
I like to get them loaded in the early morning but last Wednesday the
Hash was on. The Wasting Asset arrived with a load from the field. I was
asking the lorry driver nicely if he would draw forward to let him in to
tip when I spied our postie who had pressures of his own and was showing
them. He wanted to get past to deliver-on.
I was going to ask him nicely if he would back-up and let the lorry
forward to let the Asset past when the biggest rigg I've ever seen on a
road arrived behind the postie blocking him completely.
A huge Ford tractor was pulling a low loader and behind that he had a
trailer. If you have ever backed a caravan just imagine doing the same
again on a narrow farm road with a trailer behind the caravan.
The warm air was blue.

SEARS, the stores and home shopping group, is set to sell the Freeman
Hardy &amp; Willis shoe shop chain, City experts believe.
The buyer, according to industry observers, is former Sheffield United
director Stephen Hinchliffe, who has rapidly assembled Britain's second
largest privately-owned retail empire.
Last summer he bought the Salisbury leathergoods and accessories chain
from jeweller Signet and added Sock Shop in October.
Four more deals followed this year, including fashion stores Red or
Dead and the Contessa lingerie chain.
Mr Hinchliffe, 45, aroused controversy three years ago for alleged
corporate extravagance after he resigned as chairman from
Sheffield-based beer mats to engineering group James Wilkes.
FHW would fit well into his new Facia group, which has largely been
built up by picking up businesses that have suffered financial problems.
Chief executive Liam Strong warned in June that Sears, whose flagship
store is Selfridge's, would report a disappointing first half-year and
was suffering from a surplus of shoe stocks.

THE outlook for interest rates has improved among big stock market
investors, according to survey evidence published today.
Managers who look after billions of pounds for institutions such as
pension funds and insurance companies believe the base rate for
borrowing in a year's time will be 7%, compared with 6.75% at present.
However, a month ago in the same survey conducted by Gallup for
stockbroker Smith New Court, the base rate forecast a year ahead was
7.2%.
The fund managers are also more optimistic about the UK economy over
the next 12 months than they were in July, according to the survey.
Last month 48% expected an improvement in the economic situation, but
this has jumped to 64% in the latest results.

THE London Stock Exchange will go on the offensive this week against
Tradepoint which will shortly begin as a rival market for trading
leading shares.
The Exchange is concerned about the implications of the rule changes
which will be required when Tradepoint starts operating. The rival
market became possible when the Office of Fair Trading ruled the Stock
Exchange anti-competitive in its rule 4.18 which states that
market-makers are not allowed to advertise shares at better prices than
they display on their screens.
It suggests that market makers deserve to continue to have certain
privileges, such as being exempt from stamp duty, because of their
obligation to quote dealing prices in all market conditions, which
exposes their own capital to risk. In contrast to this quote-driven
system, Tradepoint is order-driven, enabling institutions to deal
directly between each other bypassing the traditional market-maker.
Problems are expected to arise from the competing price systems and
the Exchange will campaign for retention of the crucial rule 4.18. It
will also argue that a dual trading system will raise costs for its
members. Underlying these points is the fear that Tradepoint will siphon
major deals away from the Stock Exchange and undermine its traditional
methods.
Tradepoint expects to start its fully computerised system on September
21, by which time it will publish the names of the participants and list
the 400 leading shares to be traded at the outset.

Lesley Duncan visits the Younger Botanic Garden and finds monkey
puzzles and the seeds of a solution inside the giant arboretum
It will be exciting to view plants rom another region of the world -
Peter Baxter
The project provides an interesting amenity for garden visitors
IT'S far from chilly (and Chile) in Argyll this summer's day. The sun
is shining mercilessly. The ground is parched. Even the midges are
intimidated into inactivity by the heat. All of which is rather ironic,
as the Younger Botanic Garden is the site of a pioneering project to
recreate a Chilean rainforest in Scotland. In spite of the aberrant
weather, the Cowal peninsula's normal temperate climate and high
rainfall offer reasonably similar climatic conditions to those at the
south end of South America.
The Younger Botanic Garden is an offshoot of that singular
institution, the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh. There are two others,
Logan Botanic Garden in the Mull of Galloway, notable for its palm
trees, and Dawyck, Peeblesshire. In their different ways all three
contribute to the scientific work of the parent garden.
Don't look for a Crathes in Cowal. Charming herbaceous borders or
drifts of roses are not the Younger garden's style or remit. Rather it
has been described as a giant arboretum whose siting on craggy slopes
just south of Loch Eck makes it the most exciting one in Great Britain.
Its avenue of giant redwoods, planted in 1863, is of awesome scale and
dignity. Of the world's 662 species of conifer more than 200 are
cultivated at Benmore. No wonder Peter Baxter, the assistant curator in
charge of the garden, has occasional recourse to his reference books.
In spring the garden's collection of more than 250 species of
rhododendron (and that's not counting the hybrids) offers a gorgeous
display. As late as July there are residual patches of colour -- the
crimson of Rhododendron griersonianum at the entrance, and, at the top
end of the site, the ubiquitous ponticum with its lilacy flowers and
rampant ways.
The Royal Botanic Garden and its specialist gardens have been growing
plants from Chile since the 1850s when some remarkable species were
introduced. Most notable of these is probably the monkey puzzle tree.
Today Scotland's collective ''botanics'' can boast of growing more
Chilean plants than any other gardens in the British Isles.
The reason for this is not simply climatic compatibility, but also the
fact that in the past 10 years a considerable amount of material has
been collected from the wild through expeditions there.
Up until now these collections have been dotted about in small numbers
where it was thought they would grow best. Now, since the development of
Benmore's Bhutanese Glade in 1989, a more systematic type of planting
has been encouraged, explains Martin Gardner. He is the Edinburgh-based
projects officer and conifer conservation programme co-ordinator.
The Bhutanese Glade, approached by an upward hike through some of the
Younger garden's 120-and-more acres, turns out to be a precipitous piece
of terrain. It has four different vegetative zones. They range upwards
from the blue pine forest, through forests of hemlock (a conifer as well
as potion for uppity philosophers) and fir, to the top level where, in
the real Bhutan, yaks would ''just hoover up'' vegetation in summer.
Appropriate plantings at various levels of a cliff path reflect the
vegetation in the little Himalayan kingdom.
Chile will now get similar treatment. This kind of ''effective
ecological planting'' has an important conservation message, says
Gardner, for ''the temperate rainforests of Southern Chile are as
threatened as the tropical rainforests of Brazil or South-East Asia''.
The garden planners are aware of the need to make such plantings as
attractive as possible. ''We want to keep scientific ethics, but not
frighten away the public,'' says Gardner.
The aim is to create ''living gene banks'', relying not on single
plants but on groups of plants of known wild provenance. The seed from
these living gene banks can be stored and in future years, when the
plants in the wild are much depleted, the material from the Younger
garden can be used to replenish the population in the wild.
The monkey puzzle is a case in point. In the 1850s some 3000 seeds
were introduced into the British Isles, many of them coming to Scotland.
The difficulty is that even the experts have no knowledge where the seed
was collected in Chile. Or whether, indeed, the Younger garden's own
fine specimens come from a narrow genetic base.
Now these characterful conifers will form one of the major plantings
in the new Chilean area, with the material, mainly seed, coming from
Chile. At the moment the nine acres of the south-facing hillside look
unpromising, strewn with the detritus of felled timber. It takes an
effort to imagine their transformation to a Latin-American lookalike
landscape. Some 40 monkey puzzles will be planted on higher ground -- at
the tree line or, more fancifully, the volcanic line. There they will
look like ''giant parasols'' and certainly more at home than standing
stiffly in suburban gardens which is their usual fate.
Another kenspeckle tree is the Fitzroya cupressoides (named after the
captain of Darwin's Beagle). This rather droopy conifer may be the
oldest living thing on earth and can grow to almost 60 metres. Benmore's
impressive ones probably came as seed as long ago as the 1860s, and have
outstripped their contemporaries in the wild, thanks to ideal growing
conditions.
''Significantly, in the wild,'' Gardner points out, ''less than 10 of
seed is viable so there's a tremendous problem of regeneration. Enormous
areas of Southern Chile are just totally burnt out. Although this is a
protected plant it is only as a living plant. So there's a loophole in
the law. The wood, even when burned, is usable for roofs and tiling.''
Land-clearing for the pulp industry is a factor, with Japanese interests
acting as ''asset strippers''.
Other Chilean species already at Benmore include the Fuchsia philesia
magellanica, which, like many Chilean flowering plants, is pollinated by
hummingbirds. Its flowers are pinkish red. Many plants have flowers of
red or orange. These flowers are commonly fairly thick, leathery, long,
and tubular, to withstand the constant probing of hummingbirds. Bees and
wasps, however, sometimes cheat by going in at the base of blooms.
Other characteristic Chilean trees include the Eucryphias -- one
evergreen, one deciduous -- which produce white, waxy flowers like
Christmas roses in late summer.
Gardner has just returned from Chile and will go back there in January
on a five-week collecting expedition, working in conjunction with two
local universities -- the University of Chile in San Diego and Valdivia
University.
The Benmore plantings will take 10 to 15 years to complete on a site
where standing commercial timber has had to be felled. ''Nurse trees'',
particularly the hardy southern beech, will be used to protect the more
vulnerable of them. Some of this initial planting will take place this
autumn and coming spring and the permanent material will be gradually
introduced as the habitat improves.
Nine different conifers will be represented. The burn that runs down
the site will be fringed by almost 100 different species of woody,
non-coniferous plants including ferns and herbaceous flowers.
The late Marquis of Bute was chairman of the Younger Benmore Trust for
16 years and the rainforest project is being dedicated to him. There
will be some sort of memorial building on the site carrying a
conservation message. The Bute family had strong Chilean links last
century and still has. ''We hope the building will be a wooden structure
and would very much like it to have Chilean design,'' says Gardner.
Meanwhile on the site, garden head Peter Baxter stresses the
peripheral work involved in making the project successful. ''The
clearing of the site has to be done in a sympathetic manner, using the
natural features of the area -- stream, rock faces, and ledges.''
Beyond that, and the tasks of draining and planning access for
vehicles and pedestrians, he sees the project as ''a very valuable
opportunity to introduce plants of known wild origin to a suitable
habitat on the west coast of Scotland, contributing towards the
scientific work of the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh, and providing
an interesting amenity for garden visitors''.
He adds -- no doubt thinking of himself as well as the public -- ''It
will be exciting to view plants from another region of the world being
associated together''.
Verisimilitude stops with the plants, however. There are no plans to
introduce Chilean wildlife. Hummingbirds need not apply.

Alan Campbell examines why, at a time when Scottish football is being
blasted by the media, supporters around the country are flocking to see
their teams
DESPITE media criticism of the product, Scottish football fans are
returning to the game in ever-increasing numbers. After three years of
slow but steady growth, there are strong indications that this season's
attendances could surge dramatically.
There are two grounds for optimism among Scotland's premier-division
clubs. The first is that virtually everyone has sold a record number of
season tickets during the summer, and the second is that a number of
stadia now have larger capacities because compulsory ground
redevelopment has been completed.
It is a paradoxical situation. The SFA has admitted there is a problem
over the reputation of Scottish football by appointing its former
secretary, Ernie Walker, to head a committee of inquiry. But however
wide his remit, Walker need not trouble himself with falling
attendances. The fans, who are usually the last to be consulted, may
take note of the media bombardment, and probably agree with much of it,
but they're coming back for more.
Although clubs will continue to sell season tickets until the end of
August, almost all have exceeded last year's sales. The most startling
increase has been by Celtic, who two seasons ago had never sold more
than 7000.
Last year, for their sabbatical at Hampden, the incoming Celtic regime
increased this figure to 18,500. Already this summer, season-ticket
sales are above 21,000 and on course for the club's quota of 25,000,
which, if achieved, would leave just 9000 tickets available to the
public at the new Parkhead.
The only reason Rangers haven't increased their season ticket sales
during the summer is that they are already at the capacity of 35,000, as
they were last season. Relief, however, is on the way for the 12,000
fans on the waiting-list; one of the two new corner sections, which will
be completed at the turn of the year, will be made available to
season-ticket applicants, and the overall capacity of Ibrox will
increase to 51,000.
Perhaps, though, the most encouraging sign for the overall health of
Scottish football is that this pattern is being repeated at
premier-division clubs throughout the country.
Both Hearts and Hibs sold about 3000 season tickets last year, and
each has already passed the 4000 mark for next season. Hibs chairman
Douglas Cromb says he expects the Easter Road figure to reach 5000 by
the start of the season.
Motherwell have increased sales by more than 50%, as have Raith
Rovers, although they were in the first division last season. Falkirk,
Kilmarnock, and Partick Thistle report more modest increases. Even
Aberdeen have recovered from a sluggish start to reach record sales of
6100.
Nor are the crowd increases confined to the premier-division clubs.
Last season the average first-division crowd rose from 2056 to 2773,
while even in the second division, where attendances start to tail away
significantly, the average gate grew from 548 to 893.
So why is this happening, especially in the face of a hostile media
bombardment and a recession which seems never quite to have gone away?
Celtic public relations officer Peter McLean insists that a
combination of attractive football and success is the only recipe
guaranteed to increase attendances but, as a number of premier-division
clubs arguably cannot offer even one of these ingredients, there are
clearly other factors at work.
Certainly, some of the clubs appear to be wakening up to the concept
of marketing, one of many modern developments which hitherto had passed
them by.
But, having spoken to representatives of all 10 premier-division
clubs, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the main reason
people are returning to football is because of all-seated stadia. The
new grounds are attracting women and children for the first time, at
least where season-ticket sales are concerned.
Also, because ground capacities are now much smaller than they were
even a decade ago, there are more all-ticket games. Demand for tickets
creates its own momentum, and supporters now have to plan ahead if they
want to watch certain games in each other's company. Smaller, but
fuller, grounds also create a better atmosphere.
Also, the more civilised the surroundings the more football's doors
will be opened to previously untapped markets.

ATLAS Powder, an ICI subsidiary in America, has filed for Chapter 11
protection against creditors with a US Bankruptcy Court as a result of a
major damages award.
Last month a jury awarded damages of $488m (#309m) against Atlas's
immediate parent, ICI Explosives USA, and a Texas judge has since
ordered the company to pay.
The case involves alleged conspiracy with others to lower prices in a
concerted attack on Thermex Energy, which went bankrupt five years ago.
The suit against Atlas was begun by Thermex in 1992.
The allegations relate to events before ICI Explosives bought Atlas in
1990. The two companies say there is no basis for the claims and that
the judgement was ''unreasonable and unwarranted''.
The protection of Chapter 11 was sought to prevent Atlas being hit by
an involuntary bankruptcy petition in case current negotiations with
Thermex fail.
ICI hopes a suitable agreement can be reached with the latter and it
has a standstill agreement with Thermex that the final judgment of the
court will not be acted upon without 14 days' notice.

THE insurance and banking interim reporting season continues this week
with Perth-based General Accident due tommorrow and HSBC, parent of the
Midland Bank, out today.
General Accident is not thought likely to produce any surprises
following a string of record half-year results from three other major UK
composites over the past two weeks. The company did have the highest
first quarter profits and can, therefore, be expected to produce some
good numbers.
Projections by analysts range from #234m to #264m for a consensus of
#247.1m before tax against #203.2m previously. It is thought the
dividend could be lifted from 10.1p to between 10.5p and 11p.
Looking at the sector generally, analysts say that any downturn in UK
underwriting business is likely to be less pronounced than expected a
year ago, while many of the composites are beginning to see a recovery
in their overseas operations.
HSBC could post profits of over #1600m against #1461m last time, but
the range of projections is wide at #1522m to #1700m as the very
diversity of the bank makes it impossible to generalise about prospects.
It controls Hongkong Bank, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC Markets, James Capel and
Midland Bank, Marine Midland of the US and has interests in Canada, the
Middle East and elsewhere.
The Midland will probably have suffered from similar constraints to
its peer banks at home -- a lack of home demand and tight margins.
However, provisions against bad debts should have fallen. HSBC's
dividend is forecast to rise from 8p to a consensus 9p.
Shopping catalogue group Argos will also be revealing half-year
progress today and here analysts are looking for between #18.5m and #21m
before tax which ould compare with #15.3m for the same time last year
when it suffered a sharp fall in sales.
Sales growth of around 6% on a similar selling area could be on the
cards and shareholders can look forward to a hike in the dividend from
2.65p to perhaps as much as 4p though the bottom estimate is 3.25p.
Healthcare group Smith &amp; Nephew is also producing its interim results
today. The company, which makes products ranging from Elastoplast to
artifical knees, should reveal steady profit growth with analysts
forecasting profits in a range of #84.5m to #89.7m before tax and
exceptional charges compared with to #82.2m previously. The interim
dividend could be lifted from 2.02p to 2p to 2.2p.
Hanson's third quarter profits tommorrow are expected to touch between
#290m and #340m after exceptional charges according to analysts, up from
#282m. No change is looked for in 3p quarterly dividend dividend. But
there could be more developments in the company's #2500m agreed bid for
electricity group Eastern.
Satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting reporting full-year
results for the first time on Thursday will show its potential for more
earnings growth and share price gains, at least in the short-term,
analysts believe. Most of them are looking at between #152m and #158m
pre-tax compared with the #104m reported for the nine months and #55m at
the half-year stage. The dividend is estimated at 2.8p to 3.5p.

YOUR rugby correspondent, John Beattie, has drawn attention to the
movement of players from Glasgow rugby clubs to play the better quality
of rugby supposedly available at first division clubs in Edinburgh and
the Borders.
I had thought that the daft arrangements now being made for club rugby
-- the new premier league will be over by the end of November and 40% of
the total league programme will be completed in September, not to
mention midweek and Sunday fixtures -- were to accommodate an expanded
inter-district tournament with the higher quality of competition that it
would provide.
There is no need for a player to change club to play district rugby.
Indeed, the opposite is the case. Who in his right mind would travel
from Glasgow to Edinburgh three or four times a week to train and play
for a club of convenience when he could play district rugby for Glasgow?
The Glasgow rugby authorities could reinforce this argument by
adjusting the eligibility rules. If they were to insist that a player
could represent Glasgow only if he was a current playing member of a
Glasgow club, then the movement of players would be markedly reduced. An
incentive would then exist for members of Glasgow clubs which is missing
if ''emigrants'' are eligible.
When a player who had changed clubs found that he could not play for
Glasgow and that the incumbent in his position in the team of his
adopted district was likely to retain his place, would he not have
second thoughts, even an attack of loyalty to his old club?
The current lax rules on district representation were drawn up to
provide additional playing strength to the North &amp; Midlands before
Stirling County became a power in the land. If Stirling were
re-allocated from the Glasgow district to the North &amp; Midlands, where
geographically it belongs, the rules could be tightened without
significantly affecting the relative strengths of the district sides.
There is another point to consider. Glasgow District Council have in
the past few years begun to provide very welcome finance to promote
Glasgow rugby, particularly at representative and junior levels.
Organisation of the visits of the All Blacks and the Springboks in the
last two seasons benefited quite significantly from the council's
interest and assistance.
The district council would surely not be happy to continue support of
the Glasgow rugby authorities if the so-called Glasgow representative
side contained few if any of the players whom the council is helping to
develop.
In this era when money so obviously talks, perhaps Glasgow District
Council should make its views known in the appropriate quarters.

WHILST I commend Mr Alstead, chief executive of the Scottish Sports
Council, for his speedy reply to my letter concerning grant-aid to
projects for the upgrading of facilities at junior football stadia, true
to type he trotted out the usual semantic justification.
Within hours of your newspaper hitting the street on the morning that
my letter was published, I had been contacted by a host of junior clubs
who fully endorsed my view. I wrote that letter with the Football Trust
conditions letter in front of me and, although I am in no doubt that Mr
Alstead stated what he believed to be true, I referred to the
impediments placed in the way of any prospective applicant and implicit
in that reference was a call for a change in the way that those
parameters have been set.
I have no desire to see a free-for-all, but the 10 ''initial
requirements'' set by the Trust are surely not only a cause for concern
as identified by the clubs who contacted me, but capable of being
modified to bring a greater number of clubs and organisations into the
net.
I refer to Rule 8.2 of the ''requirements'', where security of tenure
is identified as a pre-requisite. Because the bulk of junior clubs today
rent their stadium from a landlord, in most cases a sympathetic local
authority, the applications made by most of the clubs who were in
contact, fell at that hurdle, simply because their leases were,
invariably, a great deal less than the 15 years demanded.
Mr Alstead cited examples where two clubs were awarded grants
totalling #63,000. I find that astounding on two counts. If, for
example, the sum was awarded equally as #31,500 to each club, then it
breaches Rule 7 of the ''requirements'' which states that: ''Grant will
normally not exceed 50% of the eligible costs of the project excluding
VAT, to a maximum grant of #15,000''. That surely reinforces my point
that a fairer, more even distribution mechanism is not in place and
subsequently should be adopted.
Secondly, I, and all the clubs who contacted me, would like to know,
if they were in fact awarded #31,500 as grant-aid of 50%, where was the
other 50% of core-funding coming from? To quote Rule 8.5 of the
''requirements'': ''The balance of funding for the proposed development
is either in place or pledged.'' Most junior clubs would be in ecstasy
should they be in a position to lay their hands on that kind of money.
I am in no doubt that Mr Alstead has not addressed the points that I
made in my letter, rather he has issued a ''non-denial'' denial. I am
also in no doubt that the subject of grant aid and the parameters set is
a thorny one which I am convinced will not go away. I suggest that Mr
Alstead and his trained personnel scrum down and look carefully at the
small print.

AS a shareholder and season-ticket holder of St Mirren Football Club,
I am writing to express my disgust at St Mirren's decision not to honour
season tickets for the recent match against Rangers.
I only recently received my season ticket, which stated: ''The ticket
admits the holder to St Mirren Park at all Scottish League, Scottish FA
Cup, Scottish League Cup, Reserve and friendly matches.''
Apparently this does not extend to watching Rangers. It would appear
they would prefer to have Rangers supporters in the season-ticket
section than to have St Mirren supporters who have stood by the side
through thin and thin for many years.
The phrase Judas and thirty pieces of silver springs to mind.

MY son, who resides in Germany, and is a regular subscriber to the
Celtic View, posted the View's ticket application form with a cheque to
surprise the writer with a birthday visit, with my wife, to the opening
game of the new season against Newcastle United at Celtic Park. The
application, and cheque, were dated July 20, 1995.
My wife, who was party to the plot, had to let me in on it when I said
I was about to purchase tickets for the game.
When, on August 2, I waited for over an hour in the queue at Celtic
Park, as to the ticket status, I was informed by one of the staff that
my tickets would be posted in time for the game. When I said that if
there were any doubts re the tickets, I would rather purchase new
tickets then and there, he assured me my tickets would be available no
later than Friday's (August 4) post.
Imagine my expected delight when the envelope duly arrived and my
crushing disappointment to find my son's application and cheque returned
with Celtic's apology that ''we will unfortunately be unable to provide
additional (?) tickets.''
So much for chief executive McCann's #120,000 new computerised ticket
system and his team of dedicated staff -- not forgetting the new #30,000
international telephone network.

A WEEK, it has been said, is a long time in politics, but it can seem
an even longer time in football. Last weekend, Scottish football seemed
to be heading towards good times again.
Rangers had what looked to be the easiest of tasks in the preliminary
round of the European Cup having been drawn against Anorthosis
Famagusta, the Cypriot champions . . .
Both Motherwell and Raith Rovers were favourites to march on into the
first round proper of the UEFA Cup . . .
Celtic had strengthened their team for an assault on the European
Cup-Winners' Cup . . .
And the national team need just a couple of home wins to qualify for
the finals of the European Championships.
There was the whiff of a brave new era about our domestic game --
until the matches kicked off.
Then Motherwell were soundly defeated, Rangers had to settle for a
single-goal win, and Raith Rovers were the only runaway winners.
Which is why the Hampden clash on Wednesday now assumes even more
importance for this little country which the late Bill Shankly always
claimed was the cradle of professional football.
We cannot afford to even flirt with failure again. Already the
Scottish Football Association is celebrating the fact that more than
30,000 fans will be at the European tie with Greece.
Thirty thousand? We used to look for two, or three, or even four times
that kind of attendance when Scotland were chasing those scraps of glory
which sometimes came the way of the national side.
Now the team manager Craig Brown explains the desertion of the Tartan
Army by pointing out that all across Europe, international football is
on the skids.
''In Spain, where the team is doing well, they can't get many more
fans than we will have at Hampden,''he claims.
''And in Holland they get fewer than 30,000 at their international
matches.
''At international level the game has been suffering because of the
increased interest in the major clubs. We are simply in the same
situation as a great many other countries.''
That may well be the case but there are other reasons for the apathy
which has surrounded the Scotland side for some years now.
Failing to qualify for the last World Cup Finals was a major
contributory factor in the decline of interest, particularly when it was
allied to shoddy performances in the qualifying games.
Since then we have seen the team come within touching distance of
reaching the finals in England next summer, but not in any way that
would stir the blood.
Their performances have been organised, disciplined -- but mundane.
There have been few memorable moments so far, but now Brown and his
players have the opportunity this week to rescue the sagging reputation
of our national game.
They cannot afford to fail. They are not just playing for victory on
the night against a Greek side which so narrowly and controversially
defeated them in Athens back in December.
They are playing for a place in the soccer sun next summer, for a spot
among the European elite when they contest the Championship Finals in
stadiums all across England.
The idea of missing out on that tournament when it is just across the
Border is unthinkable.
I remember covering the World Cup Finals in 1966 when Scotland had
failed to qualify for a competition on its own doorstep.
It was not always easy to listen to the jibes of the English then, and
it would be no easier now.
The players recognise that. Brown also recognises that. Now they must
put the various troubles they have had at the weekend and before behind
them and take another step towards qualification.
If they do so then they can help claw back some prestige for their
country.
They can also give the suffering support something they can celebrate.
Above all they will then have the chance to push themselves into the
forefront of our football once more.
The players want desperately to see the Tartan Army return to Hampden
in massive numbers.
But they must earn the respect of these battle-weary fans before that
can happen and they can do that by reaching the finals.
Scotland have not been in a better position to qualify for a major
competition since going to West Germany in 1974 to take part in the
World Cup Finals for th first time in sixteen years.
Back then they needed just one win -- over Czechoslovakia -- at
Hampden to make certain. They won, and the Tartan Army's love affair
with the World Cup was born.
Now two wins are necessary and the first is against Greece this week.
There cannot be any thought of failure. Because if Scotland flop and
the clubs then follow that lead in Europe, this country will be
downgraded still further in the eyes of the football world.
All we will be left with are memories of days gone by, distant days
when the Scottish national team and the clubs were still considered a
power in the game.
Surely that cannot happen -- or can it?

<HEADLINE>Labour MP claims more companies are going under than starting up. Small firms failing to lead economic recovery</HEADLINE>

THE small company sector, usually a major generator of new jobs, is
not taking off in the economic recovery as much as hoped.
The number of firms going out of business exceeded the number of new
start-ups in the last financial year, according to the Labour Party,
while 3i, the specialist investor in small and medium-sized firms,
claimed they were less confident now than six months ago.
Alan Milburn, Labour MP for Darlington, said that in 1994/95 there
were 17,500 more firms de-registering for VAT than new companies being
registered.
Small and medium-sized companies less happy with the economy outweigh
the optimists by 15 percentage points in 3i's latest survey, which
compares with a negative balance of 4% last February.
De-registering can come about as a result of the steady increase in
the VAT threshold, with no registration necessary if annual turnover is
#46,000 or less, which means most one-man bands are excluded.
Mr Milburn points out that VAT-registered firms are usually
well-established and have the greatest potential for growth.
De-registration usually means the firm has gone out of business.
''The haemorrhage of enterprise throughout Britain is graphic evidence
of continuing economic uncertainty,'' Mr Milburn said. ''While the
Government extols the myth of a recovery, out in the real world a
generation of business talent is being laid to waste. There is no
feel-good factor in the business community because so many firms have
been hit hard by Tory economic failure.''
The biggest loss of businesses in the past year came in Southern
England, where the recession hit hardest. Scotland fared better with
12,316 de-registrations outnumbering registrations by just 213. The most
positive area was London where more new firms started up than closed
down.
As a result of the recession, Mr Milburn's figures, which were derived
from Parliamentary questions to Treasury Minister David Heathcoat-Amory,
showed that in the four years to last April there was an overall loss of
163,000 VAT registered firms. The latest offical figures will be
produced by the Treasury tomorrow.
Unlike previous recoveries the present upturn is not being led by the
consumer sector but by exports which are more usually the preserve of
larger companies. In contrast to earlier hopes, the more
domestic-oriented smaller businesses are still feeling the lingering
effects of the recession.
Declining optimism is also the feature across Europe, with 3i
reporting negative balances averaging 27% against 8% six months ago.
''The expectations of Europe's small and dynamic companies are an
important barometer for its economy and the prospects for growth,'' said
3i's marketing director Adam Quarry.
''It is therefore disheartening to see that Europe's entrepreneurs are
increasingly gloomy about the economic outlook, although they remain
confident about their own company prospects.''
He called on European Union governments to give greater encouragement
and more consistent support for the sector.
Mr Milburn said Labour was committed to establishing regional
development agencies to assist small firms financially and to introduce
measures to deal with late payments by companies to suppliers. In this
connection, credit insurer Trade Indemnity reports this morning that in
the second quarter the average value of long overdue debt rose to a
record #170,000 in the second quarter, as shown in its latest survey.

THE Germans are clinical, the Belgians boring, and the Italians
passionate, if we are to believe widely held social stereotypes.
Perhaps Alex Ferguson should have consulted his Observer's Guide to
Countries by Personality in 1992. Under France, he would have inevitably
found volatile.
Certainly Eric the Red has more than a fair share of his national
characteristic.
Last week he demanded that he be released from the three-year contract
he signed with Manchester United earlier in the year. Cantona felt that
he was being hounded by the English FA when they announced an inquiry
into whether United broke the terms of the player's suspension by
playing him in a practice game against Rochdale. Surely not a heinous
crime.
The FA decided to take no action but it is plain that Cantona feels
beleaguered and the United fans believe he is being harshly treated.
As one said: ''If he had been playing in the street with his son, they
would probably have launched an inquiry. He must feel it's never going
to end.
''Following the incident with the Crystal Palace supporter, he was
punished four times -- the FA ban, court case, being stripped of the
French national side's captaincy, and his fine from the club. Surely now
it's time to leave him alone.''
Following the Selhurst Park fracas some suggested that Cantona should
never be allowed to kick a ball again and, certainly, his record doesn't
make for pleasant reading: punching his own goalkeeper in 1987, swearing
at the national coach in '88, throwing the ball at a referee in '91, and
spitting at a Leeds fan in 1993. He even accused the referee of cheating
during United's match against Galatasaray in Turkey two years ago.
But for Ferguson, Cantona is crucial to his future. That's why he has
protected him so much and that's why he flew to Paris last week to
placate the temperamental Frenchman.
On his return, Ferguson said: ''I won't even contemplate his
departure. I want him in my team. It's as simple as that.''
But Inter-Milan are still waiting in the wings and may yet swoop for
Cantona. As Inter's president, Massimo Moratti, says: ''There is always
room for champions at Inter and I am convinced that Cantona is one.''
The Italian chief made no secret of his wish to sign Cantona when he
lured his former team-mate Paul Ince to Italy for #7m during the summer.
The United fans are edgy. They have seen something of a clear-out with
Ince's departure, and Andrei Kanchelskis in the process of moving to
Merseyside. Mark Hughes, a great favourite with the fans, has gone to
Chelsea for #1.5m, and there are dissenting voices within and outwith
the team.
Suddenly the judgment of United's saviour has been called into
question, and the whispers are getting louder that Ferguson has pinned
too much hope on the fickle Frenchman and last season's signing from
Newcastle, Andy Cole.
Like Cantona, football fans can be fickle. Last year, United were the
nearly men. There are no trophies in the cupboard at Old Trafford, and
Ferguson may become a victim of his own success. For the supporters now
expect, indeed demand, victory. Nothing less will do.
While United have floundered, the other Premiership clubs have been
shopping for players and preparing for a determined campaign in what
promises to be a particularly tough season.
On the positive side at least, Ferguson can look forward to the return
of Paul Parker who played only three times last season because of an
ankle injury.
Nevertheless, as the new season looms, Ferguson has gambled his future
on the fragile temperament of a hugely talented but flawed Frenchman.
Perhaps he would have been better to go through that Observer's Guide
and plump for someone dependable instead.

A HALLMARK last used almost 80 years ago has been revived by an
Inverness goldsmith. Mr Colin Campbell, who has his workshop in Market

THE defection of Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, Lieutenant General
Hussein Kamel Hassan, will have the Iraqi dictator spitting blood with
rage. Not only is Hussein Kamel married to his eldest and favourite
daughter, Raghad, he is a member of the Takriti clan on which Saddam
Hussein bases his power, and had been tipped as a possible successor to
his father-in-law.
His importance can hardly be overstated. It was he who had been
responsible for building up Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction before the Gulf War; after the war he became Defence
Minister and crushed the Kurd and Shia revolutions; then, two months
ago, he was appointed Minister of Industry in charge of the country's
programme of military industrialisation.
What made his defection even more remarkable was that when he escaped
late last Tuesday night, he took with him his brother, Colonel Saddam
Kamel Hassan, who is married to Rana, another of Saddam Hussein's
daughters, and was head of the dictator's personal bodyguard. With them
went some 30 senior officers.
First reports suggest that the defection was triggered by growing
tension between Uday, Saddam Hussein's thuggish son, and Hussein Kamel
which resulted in Hussein Kamel fearing for his life. It was a question
of one danger being greater than the other.
He said on arrival in Amman that the Saddam Hussein regime had ''lost
its credibility'' and that he was contacting people inside and outside
the nation ''to work to put an end to the suffering of the Irai people''
by overthrowing the regime.
It is unlikely, however, that he will be welcomed by the Iraqi
resistance movement. He has been a loyal supporter of Saddam Hussein for
too long to be trusted by the various groups that make up the fragmented
movement and are united only in the wish to get rid of Saddam Hussein.
Even if he is accepted by the West he will have to be guarded for the
rest of his life.
His real value to the West lies in what he knows. He can reveal the
true extent of the political chaos in Baghdad and the discontent within
the army.
He also knows more about Iraq's nuclear, germ and poison gas warfare
programmes than anyone else. And he is well aware of the value of his
information. Reports of his first contacts with American officials
suggest there is going to be some hard bargaining. On the table: a safe,
and presumably prosperous, life in America, in exchange for Saddam
Hussein's deepest secrets.
He also has locked up in his brain information which would be of great
interest to MI6 and to a number of British politicians, for he was the
man who negotiated with Dr Gerald Bull, the brilliant gun designer, to
build his supergun for Iraq. If it had been completed it could have
devastated Iraq's neighbours, but Bull was murdered, presumably by the
Israelis, before he could complete the gun and it has now been
destroyed. But the affair still rumbles on, threatening an explosion in
British politics with the Scott report into the arms for Iraq scandal.
As part of his programme for buying up foreign technical companies to
provide Iraq with arms, Hussein Kamel controlled Al Arabi Trading, an
Iraqi company. In a complicated deal Al Arabi bought the Technology
Development Group, a British holding company, and through it a
controlling interest in Matrix Churchill. It was the failed prosecution
of three directors of Matrix Churchill for illegally exporting
arms-making machinery to Iraq which eventually led to Sir Richard
Scott's inquiry into the affair.
There is no doubt that Hussein Kamel knows the secrets of the Matrix
Churchill affair and other similar deals. If he decided to unlock this
particular cupboard there will be a mighty rattling of skeletons.
Hussein Kamel's defection could, in fact, be almost as embarrassing to
Britain as it is to Saddam Hussein.

Everton 1, Blackburn 0
JUST as they had done against Manchester United last May, Joe Royle's
Everton arrived at Wembley as underdogs and made off with the bone,
adding the FA Charity Shield to the FA Cup and suggesting that the team
labelled ''The dogs of war'' are developing the bite to add to their
bark.
It was one of the less distinguished of the 22 charity shield matches
since the event was switched to Wembley and was watched by the smallest
crowd in that time -- 40,149. They saw a niggling first half in which
each goalkeeper made only one save before Vinny Samways decided the game
with a deft lob shortly after the interval.
Afforded the luxury of counter-attacking thereafter, Everton played
the ball around neatly and defended stoutly, restricing Alan Shearer to
one free kick that Neville Southall held and a late, unsuccessful shout
for a penalty as he tumbled under substitute David Watson's challenge.
Inevitably, there were absentees on both sides, though not as many as
a year ago when Blackburn were so severely depleted in losing 2-0 to
Manchester United. This time, the new champions lacked Colin Hendry and
Henning Berg, both on international duty, Jason Wilcox, and Paul
Warhurst. That meant using the #5m striker Chris Sutton in central
defence, but allowed Scotland's Kevin Gallacher to return to the big
stage after breaking a leg for the second time last season.
As well as the injured Duncan Ferguson, Everton had to do without
Andrei Kanchelskis, who would add a spectacular new dimension to their
attacking if they could persuade an FA Premier League tribunal to sort
out the tangle of his proposed transfer from United.
In his absence yesterday, Everton again left Paul Rideout, scorer of
the FA Cup winner, upfield largely on his own and flooded the midfield,
where tackles were shuddering and space hard to find. It was Samways,
one of their five players in the centre of the park, who used the room
vacated further forward to score 12 minutes into the second half.
Gary Ablett, who had moved to left back at half time, sent a careful
pass down the flank which the former Tottenham man met on the up,
cleverly lobbing over England goalkeeper Tim Flowers and in off the base
of the far post.
Thus began another new era for Blackburn, Kenny Dalglish having taken
a step out of the limelight and handed comtrol of team affairs to Ray
Harford. Like all champions, they must now contend with the double
burden of being the team every one wants to beat and also of sustaining
a challenge in the European Cup, in which a cynical change to the rules
has granted them automatic entry into the Champions League.
On yesterday's evidence, they will certainly want Sutton back in
attack to take the weight off Shearer and add his own quota of goals.
After two years of serious under-achievement in the League, Everton's
prospects are difficult to assess. For the moment they have certainly
settled for putting results ahead of style. The confidence to play more
expansive football will, it must be hoped, eventually follow from more
successes like this one.

PETER Whitehead is prepared to die for his dream of Olympic marathon
gold, a dream which drew tangible substance from the most unheralded
British performance of the World Championships, writes Doug Gillon.
Whitehead, aged 30, and coached by Scottish distance guru Brian
Scobie, achieved the UK's best major championship finish since Charlie
Spedding's Olympic bronze in 1984 when finishing fourth behind the
Spanish winner, Martin Fiz, on Saturday.
Fiz, also the European champion, and first man to do the title double,
clocked 2hr 11min 42sec ahead of Mexican Dionisio Ceron (2-12-13),
winner of London in April.
Whitehead finished in 2-14-08, with Spain's European bronze medallist,
Alberto Juzdado, 81sec behind. His top-five placing gives Whitehead an
automatic Olympic place.
The Leeds man's sights are set on gold in Atlanta next year -- a goal
for which he mortgaged his house and lives apart from his wife, in New
Mexico, running up a $2000 phone bill in three months alone.
Displaying a frightening intensity, he revealed: ''If someone said to
me: ''You can be Olympic champion, but the price you have to pay is that
you will be dead the next day,' I would say I would take it . . . it's
all I ever wanted to be -- it's my dream.''
Richard Nerurkar finished seventh (2-15-47), his poorest placing in
five attempts at the distance, though one place ahead of Commonwealth
champion Steve Moneghetti.
Mark Hudspith, from Morpeth, where he is trained by Scotland's former
Commonwealth gold medallist, Jim Alder, dropped out at 20 miles, blood
soaking through his right shoe from blisters.
Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan carved out a glorious 5000 metres victory
for her country when the event was staged for the first time for women
in a world championship.
Wedding vows back home were delayed as the nation stopped for the
14min 46.47sec which it took for her to beat world record-holder,
Fernando Ribiero of Portugal.
On the lap of honour, however, Irish supporters were upset when she
thrice snubbed the offer of the tricolour. There was a flood of angry
calls to radio and TV stations back home.
''Flags are too heavy. I didn't want to carry anything,'' she said.
Ivan Pedrosa, though well short of his controversial unratified world
long jump mark (8.96m) killed off the contest with his second attempt,
8.70m, after orchestrating the crowd to a clapping frenzy. ''I tried to
beat the world record -- again,'' said the defiant Cuban.
Jamaican James Beckford stunned the official world record-holder and
defending champion, Mike Powell, by snatching silver (8.30m), surpassing
the American by a centimetre on his sixth and final jump.
Tony Jarrett first saw Allen Johnson in 1991, training on the UCLA
track in Los Angeles. ''I realised then that this guy was going to whip
my butt one day,'' he said.
His worst fears were realised in the 110m hurdles final when the
American ran 13.00sec, joint fourth best ever, and the fastest time of
his life, with Jarrett (13.04) once again the quickest man to lose a
world title. He ran 13.00 when beaten by Colin Jackson two years ago.

ALEX Cathie made a winning return to Northfield on Saturday after his
Scottish singles disappointment of the previous week when he won the Ayr
Open singles with a 21-18 victory over Dougie McKie, from Northfield
Private.
The Coylton bowler, who had lost out at the last 16 stage in the
national championship, found himself trailing for much of Saturday's
final and, with 20 ends completed, McKie looked poised for victory when
he led 18-14.
However, McKie, whose father Willie won the title back in 1961, failed
to score again as Cathie reeled off the seven shots he needed for the
title over the next six ends.
The women's singles title turned into a romp for Crosshill's Margaret
Hutchison, who moved ahead 4-3 on the fifth end and went on to a 21-16
victory over defending champion Jean Sykes, from Cumnock.
The men's pairs produced the best finish of the day with
Dalmellington's Jim Black and Tommy Campbell battling to a 17-16 extra
end win over Maybole's Gavin Campbell and Peter Brown, from Annbank.
Black and Campbell counted six shots on the thirteenth end to lead
16-11 in the 15 end final, but Campbell and Brown stormed back with a
four on the penultimate end followed by a single on the last, to push
the match into overtime. But it was Black and Campbell who wrapped up
the extra end win.
The women's pairs title went to the international duo of Betty Forsyth
(Blantyre) and Janice Maxwell (Castle Douglas), who counted four shots
over the last two ends to beat defending champions Mary Reid and Susan
Kelly, from Stranraer, 14-11.
Kelly did have the consolation of watching her son Michael take the
boys' under-16 title when he hit back from 11-7 down at nine ends to
beat Thomas Newall, from Kincaidston-Belmont, 12-14. The girls' title
went to Galston when Mary Crawford led from the opening end to beat
Patrician McNulty (Kirkhill) 21-13. Results:
Men's singles -- A Cathie (Coylton) 21, D McKie (Northfield Private)
18.
Women's singles -- M Hutchison (Crosshill) 21, J Sykes (Cumnock) 6.
Men's pairs -- J Black (Dalmellington) and T Campbell (Crooksmoss) 17,
G Campbell (Maybole) and P Brown (Annbank) 16 (after extra end).
Women's pairs -- B Forsyth (Blantyre) and J Maxwell (Castle Douglas)
14, M Reid and S Kelly (Stranraer) 11.
Boys' singles -- M Kelly (Portpatrick) 21, T Newall
(Kincaidston-Belmont) 14.
Girls' singles -- M Crawford (Galston) 21, P McNulty (Kirkhill) 13.

Oslo,
AFTER a quarter of a century as an oil producer, Norway has started to
realise that it needs to save money and not spend it all now.
Oil has turned Norway, a seafaring and fishing country of 4.3 million
people, into a thriving industrial state with a welfare system that is
second to none.
Many countries struggle with runaway budget deficits but Norway,
Europe's top oil producer, has minimal debt and the budget is forecast
to show a surplus in 1996.
However, its economy is vulnerable because of the dependence on oil,
which is expected to stop flowing in 25 years.
In addition, weakness of the dollar is currently reducing Norwegian
revenue from the oil business, economists say.
Norway, with an ageing population and no baby boom, may not be as rich
as it thinks if future social expenditure is taken into account.
Torstein Moland, the central bank governor, has suggested that the
State Petroleum Fund, which until now has served as ''petty cash'' for
the government, be turned into a savings account for pensions. It would
also be a buffer against rapid oil price fluctuations.
''At some point we will be adversely affected by two problems
simultaneously -- oil revenues will probably fall markedly and social
security expenditure will rise sharply,'' Moland told the bank's annual
meeting.
''As a minimum, the increase in petroleum revenues in the coming years
should be set aside,'' Moland said. ''Over time there are no real
options but to tighten government budgets.''
The country's oil production, from fields in the North Sea and the
Norwegian Sea, is forecast to peak in 1996 at three million barrels per
day but will then decline.
However it has natural gas reserves for another 100 years or more,
which will help to make up for falling oil revenues in the next century.
Oil and gas production accounts for 16% of the economy, compared with
1% in Britain, which produces almost as much oil as Norway but has a
much bigger economy.
Norway has not been quite the same since a small notice in the Norsk
Lysningsblad, or government gazette, announced the first petroleum
licensing round on April 13, 1965.
Taking a chance, the government opened up a part of the North Sea to
exploration although a committee of geologists had established in 1958
that ''the possibility of finding coal, oil, or sulphur on the Norwegian
contintental shelf can be ignored''.
Foreign companies dominated exploration in the beginning and it was US
group Phillips Petroleum that made the first major find -- the discovery
of the Ekofisk field in 1969. Still on stream, Ekofisk began production
in 1971.
The government, anxious to take control of the new business, soon
founded the state-owned Statoil company and established the principle of
50% state participation in production.
Special taxes and royalties on oil and gas have helped the state land
as much as 640bn crowns (#65bn) since production began, according to
official figures.
Of that sum, 180bn crowns (#18.3bn) have been reinvested in offshore
activities through the State Direct Financial Interest, a body which
supplements Statoil.
Private oil firms have earned 100 billion crowns (#10.2bn) after tax,
according to the government. It has predicted that the companies will
earn another 150bn crowns (#15.3bn) from oil and gas in future.
Moland suggested that the petroleum fund could save up to 500bn crowns
(#51bn) between now and 2010, which would be enough to secure pensions
and other social costs.
Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen backed the idea, saying the money
could be put in shares, bonds or other investments abroad or in Norway
which would earn a return.--Reuter

John Anderson is a Scottish banker who became an international arms
dealer. Brian Wilson traces the extraordinary transition and suggests
those interested in the truth about arms for Iran and Iraq should start
by listening to his story
LATE last month, John Anderson was called to Glasgow by the
Investigation Branch of Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. For the period
of questioning he was placed under arrest and, when it was over, he was
told by his two inquisitors that he was now ''unarrested''. He went back
home to Fort Augustus.
Around the same time, his former business colleague, Gerald James, was
having much the same experience in London. The content and circumstances
of these interviews were the stuff of fiction -- but they were just the
latest episodes in the wider drama which has engulfed these two men.
On this occasion, they say, their interrogators were interested in
just two lines of inquiry -- whether they possess evidence which proves
that one of their companies, BMARC, traded illegally in arms with Iran
(which it certainly did), and the role of Jonathan Aitken, former Chief
Secretary to the Treasury and previously a BMARC director.
At the end of the sessions, there were no charges against Anderson and
James, just as there have been none against them since the Ministry of
Defence police first raided the premises of BMARC's parent company,
Astra plc, five years ago. They were, however, forced out by
institutional shareholders and, in 1993, Astra went into administration.
Anderson's arrest last month at least lacked the drama of a previous
encounter with the authorities, following the initial raid. Then, he was
taken from Fort Augustus by two police officers and driven at high speed
to Glasgow, where he was put on a plane to Gatwick.
A police car then set off at even higher speed for Ramsgate and duly
crashed into another car. The next day, a shaken and injured Anderson
was asked a few routine questions before being put on the plane back
home. He still suffers neck pains as a result of the accident and
continues to pursue a settlement from the police.
It is the kind of bizarre story which crops up routinely in any
conversation with Anderson or James. For whatever reasons, the
authorities decided five years ago that they should be cast as outsiders
-- ostracised, ridiculed, investigated, discredited, pursued.
Coincidentally or not, their troubles began soon after Astra blew the
whistle on the Iraq supergun affair, when they found that a Belgian firm
which they had taken over was supplying propellants for the project. The
question of whether Anderson and James are guilty of any offences in the
way their companies operated remains to be tested in court, if it ever
gets there.
In the meantime, their hitherto successful business has been brought
to its knees. The Department of Trade and Industry has spent, according
to a parliamentary answer, more that #2.7m on investigating it. When MoD
police raided Astra they took away enough files to fill two large
warehouses. Now it is Customs and Excise who are doing the questioning.
Seldom can the various agencies of government have amassed so much
information about any company. Yet the astonishing contention on which
ministers now routinely rely is that none of them told the others about
what they had found.
There are two possible reasons for the treatment of Anderson and
James. The first, whispered knowingly by certain Tory MPs to anyone who
will listen, is that they are supposed to be paranoid fantasists who got
in above their depth in the arms trade, ran Astra and its subsidiaries
along lines so improper as to justify their removal and subsequent
pursuit, and are now utterly unreliable purveyors of far-fetched
stories.
The second theory is that they know most of what there is to know
about the illegal arms dealings of the late 1980s and early 1990s with
Iran and Iraq, including where the vast commissions went. The last thing
which many people want is that their testimony should be heard or, worse
still, taken seriously. So they have been ruthlessly, relentlessly
marginalised.
MOST of us grew up with the name Astra. They were the company who made
bangers and rockets to celebrate Guy Fawkes Day. When James and Anderson
bought it in 1981, Astra was owned by two elderly Jewish gentlemen who
employed 38 people at Sandwich in Kent, calling in extra staff to cope
with seasonal demand as November 5 approached.
Anderson is a 64-year-old native of Balloch who did his stint in the
RAF and then spent 20 years working for the Bank of Scotland. In the
early 1970s he was based in the bank's foreign section in Glasgow and
then became a manager in the international department in London. By the
end of the decade he was fed up with banking and was looking for a new
challenge.
Via a Christmas card, he renewed his acquaintance with James, a
merchant banker with a Monday Club pedigree, and they teamed up as a
consultancy. Anderson knew his way round the complex world of
international credit and export guarantees. Their first commission was
to advise another fireworks company, Brock's, who had moved north to
Sanquhar.
Brock's had received orders from Nigeria and Malaysia for
thunderflashes and smoke grenades. They then ran into difficulty in
obtaining payment. Having had past dealings with Anderson, they asked
him to help. That job, he recalls, took just a couple of days to sort
out. But the lesson stayed with him -- if you can make a firework, you
can make a thunderflash, and indeed every other explosive device
involved in the conduct of war.
The crucial assets held by the firework makers were explosives
licences. When, soon afterwards, Astra came on the market, James and
Anderson tried to act as brokers for a sale to a German company. When
that fell through, they decided to buy it themselves and develop the
company's untapped potential for entering the arms trade. At the same
time, Astra carried on making fireworks.
IN TERMS both of business expansion and the ethos of the eighties, the
new-look Astra was a terrific success. James and Anderson proved to be
highly effective salesmen as they toured the arms fairs of the world,
with enthusiastic encouragement from the British Government. The DTI
provided them with assistance and made the contacts for them to wine and
dine.
Signal cartridges for the US Army; smoke grenades for Abu Dhabi;
practice bombs for the RAF -- the orders flowed and Astra was soon
looking to acquire smaller companies which would facilitate expansion.
First they bought the Chicago-based Walters Group which engaged in
precision engineering and fuse manufacture.
This was followed in 1988 by BMARC -- British Manufacture and Research
Co -- a long-established company based in Mrs Thatcher's home town of
Grantham. Finally, and fatefully, they bought one of the world's oldest
explosives companies, PRB, a Belgian propellant manufacturer which
proved to be up to its neck in the Iraq supergun.
By any standards, this was big-time stuff which left Astra and its
subsidiaries employing more than 2000 people. No company can operate,
far less expand so aggressively, in this trade without attracting the
interest of government agencies, including the intelligence services.
This was particularly true, Anderson recalls, after the Howe doctrine of
December 1984 concerning the Iran-Iraq war.
Supposedly, that put a British ''deadly weapons'' embargo in place. It
is now beyond reasonable doubt that throughout the Iran-Iraq war, the
embargo was honoured mainly in the breach. By one route or another, many
of the leading players in the British arms industry contributed to the
conflagration. Britain's reputation was as a relatively easy source of
export licences.
Some companies, in the highest traditions of the arms trade, helped to
arm both sides in the war, and one of these companies was BMARC.
BMARC's dealings with Iran were inherited from Oerlikon, the Swiss
company which had previously owned BMARC and had signed up for Project
Lisi -- an epic order which involved supplying almost 200 naval cannon
to Iran, via Singapore. When Astra acquired BMARC in 1988, the company
was already two years into Project Lisi.
Anderson recalls that, when he visited the Grantham factory, there was
common talk of the ''Iran order''. Anderson claims that when he
challenged this he was told that it was nonsense and that Singapore was
the true destination.
Anderson continues to find it remarkable that, on obtaining the
biggest order in BMARC's history, Major General Donald Isles, the BMARC
deputy managing director -- previously director of munitions at the
British Embassy in Washington and director general of weapons for the
Army -- did not consult Jane's Fighting Ships which might have cast
doubt on Singaporean demand for naval cannon.
BOOKS could, and doubtless will be, written on the mind-boggling
detail of who sold what to whom, via where and with whose knowledge and
acquiescence during the late 1980s and early 90s. It is possible that,
as Alan Clark might argue, the great British public neither knows nor
cares about the details of such arrangements; particularly when they
come to light several years after the event.
Indeed, arms for Iraq might have ended up as a murky episode of
interest only to aficionados of such matters if it had not been for the
inescapable fact that several ministers in Her Majesty's Government were
prepared to see three men go to jail rather than cough up the
inconvenient truth that the company had been operating with the full
knowledge of British Intelligence.
As a result of this disclosure and the furore which ensued, John Major
appointed Sir Richard Scott to enquire into arms for Iraq. The crucial
question is why Scott's remit did not also include arms for Iran, which
would have taken him straight into the affairs of BMARC and all the
ramifications which flowed from them.
Subsequently, and ostensibly in reply to my questions, Michael
Heseltine made his dramatic parliamentary statement. The House of
Commons, he proclaimed, had been inadvertently misled on a number of
occasions about BMARC and arms for Iran. He had now become aware, as a
result of inquiries which he had instigated, that cannon supposedly
bound for Singapore under Project Lisi may have ended up in Iran.
While the media excited itself over Heseltine's cleverness in keeping
himself clean on another potentially messy issue and speculation mounted
over what Aitken should or must have known in his role as a BMARC
non-executive director, his former colleagues in that company --
including Anderson -- shook their heads in disbelief at the farce which
was unfolding.
They had, after all, told the DTI about Project Lisi several years
earlier. There were plenty of grounds for believing that the
intelligence services had known everything there was to know about
Project Lisi from the word go. James had again spelt out the details in
his evidence to the trade and industry select committee in 1992.
But above all, there were these two warehouses full of files taken
from the Astra offices which Anderson and James have maintained all
along could set out the full picture. This gold-dust had been in the
hands of the MoD police since 1990, yet we are invited to believe that
neither the DTI nor Customs and Excise availed themselves of it, in
spite of all the forensic examination of BMARC's affairs which they
themselves have been engaged in.
Somehow -- in spite of James's efforts to tell them; in spite of the
Astra files; in spite of a #2.7m DTI investigation into the company; in
spite of the intelligence reports -- ministers had avoided knowing the
significance of Project Lisi at the time the Scott Inquiry was
established, and right up to the point at which Heseltine made his
statement.
Now, having been struck by a thunderbolt of enlightenment, Heseltine
has ensured that arms for Iran will not be investigated by a full-scale
judicial inquiry, but by the trade and industry select committee --
several of whose Tory members have been among the most active
disparagers of Anderson and James.
It is as clear as anything can be that arms for Iran and BMARC should
have been as much part of the Scott Inquiry as arms for Iraq and Matrix
Churchill. Anderson is in no doubt that such an inconvenient outcome was
avoided not on the basis of Project Lisi being a mystery which was only
later discovered, but through a systematic determination to ignore and
suppress available evidence.
If the sword of truth is ever to prevail, it would not be a bad idea
for Anderson's next trip from Fort Augustus to be to the warehouses full
of files to which he has been denied access since 1990. If the
information which would verify his version of events is indeed to be
found there, then even more serious questions will be begged of those
who have kept them under wraps for so long.

EARLIER this summer, GHK, arguably the City of Glasgow's most
successful club, finishing ninth in last year's leagues, tried to tempt
former Melrose and Scotland star Keith Robertson to come to Old
Anniesland as coach.
Robertson had been heard to speak jokingly that he would ''like to get
his hands on those big GHK forwards'' and several meetings took place.
Since then, of course, the club has had its trials and tribulations,
but the coming of Hugh Campbell as coach seems to have meant that only
two players are leaving the club. Some may have made their minds up to
go, but Keith Robertson was close to joining.
''But it would have meant too big a commitment for me,'' says
Robertson. ''I would have ended up having to move my family through to
Glasgow to do the job properly. I admire GHK for what they have done
with their club, and they do seem to have the right attitude.''
Robertson, who has quit his full-time job and is acting as unpaid
director of rugby for Melrose as he seeks another, nevertheless has his
misgivings about rugby in the west.
''I used to play against Glasgow High and Glasgow Accies when they
were great clubs, but what has happened has been quite sad. I find it
amazing, for instance, that the three Craig boys have gone from a
Glasgow club to Hawick. That's a very long way to go to play rugby.''
Now his energies are concentrated on getting his side, with its myriad
of talent, back to the very top, ahead of Stirling County.
''The whole of the structure of rugby is changing, and with the
payments system in place I see the coaches benefiting almost as a
consequence.
''I do have huge concerns about this season. Amidst all the talk of a
more competitive structure at a higher level, people have to understand
that the clubs must have meaningful competition.''
I remember Keith Robertson's first cap. Dragged out of his flu bed to
play against the New Zealanders, he jinked out, in, and then out again
past Bryan Williams on one of the few occasions he had the ball, but
when he talks now it is altogether far more direct.
''I really don't believe that an eight-team league will improve our
rugby this year. Already people are talking about the games being
negative.''
I'm not sure I agree wholly with Keith in that, as it is perhaps wrong
to say that competition means stifled games. The New Zealanders and
South Africans manage to produce thrilling games in a rarefied
atmosphere.
''It is going to be a huge season in so many ways that we have to get
it right.
''I believe strongly in a three-tier set up, with internationals,
districts and club rugby, but the clubs need a strong presence, and time
will tell if a league season that finishes in November, and a cup
competition, are enough.''
Having decided to give his all to his home club, it's interesting to
hear Robertson say that, like any good business would, Melrose have
produced a five-year business plan to see them through an era of change
in the game.
Recruited in the summer has been Rowan Shepherd, the former Edinburgh
Academical full back, John Amos and Mark Moncrieff from Gala were to
move from the few miles down the road but decided against it after some
heady local pressure, and perhaps the star attraction this season is to
be an as yet unnamed Tongan wing-forward who is currently the understudy
to Josh Kronfeld at Otago in New Zealand. We just have to hope he's not
Jonah Lomu's wee brother.
Weigh against that a relative lack of new faces playing for Glasgow
clubs and you can sense the unease Robertson might have had about coming
to Glasgow, although his arrival will undoubtedly have brought fresh
talent with it.
Yet again, the experience the city needs stays elsewhere. It was a
bold move by GHK. It's a shame it didn't come off.

HEARTS will go back to their roots to end recent flirtations with
relegation. Manager Jim Jefferies has reintroduced club tradition to
Tynecastle, and John Colquhoun insists Saturday's 5-1 victory over
Manchester City was just the start.
''To have a manager with his roots at the club unites the fans,'' said
Colquhoun, ''and we have found that filtering through on to the pitch.''
Colquhoun scored twice with Allan Johnstone, Brian Hamilton, and David
Hagen claiming a goal each, while Nick Summerbee scored for City.
At Easter Road, Hibs had six players missing yet still managed to
defeat Ray Wilkins' Queen's Park Rangers 2-1, with a handful of young
players involved.
Chris Reid, Chris Jackson, and Graeme Donald played from the start and
three others made appearances from the bench in the second half.
''We have another generation of players available, and this result
indicates a squad of depth and quality is ready for the new season,''
said skipper Gordon Hunter.
The Londoners' Danny Dichio scored first, but Pat McGinlay struck
twice after the interval.
* MOTHERWELL were still suffering form a European hangover when they
lost 4-1 to Bryan Robson's Middlesbrough at Fir Park.
The English side, with former Celtic players Chris Morris and Derek
Whyte, plus #5m signing Nick Barmby in their line-up, cruised through
the second half, with a Craig Hignett hat trick securing victory.
Robbie Mustoe gave the English Premiership newcomers the lead, but
just after the break, Tommy Coyne equalised with a penalty. It was
Motherwell's only moment of joy in a performance which had manager
McLeish keeping his players locked in the dressing room for more than an
hour after the match.
Bolton, another new side to the Premiership, also celebrated a
victory, beating Kilmarnock 2-1 at Rugby Park.
Former Dundee United and Aberdeen striker Mixu Paatelainen gave Bolton
the lead after just seven minutes, and Fabnian De Freitas added a second
before half-time. John Henry pulled one back for Killie after the
interval.

SECOND and THIRD DIVISIONS JOHN Hillcoat's penalty save at Somerset
Park earned Clyde a point on Saturday and meant that the debut goal by
Charlie Nicholas was not overshadowed by an adverse result.
Ayr United's new striker, Gordon Dalziel, struck the penalty low to
Hillcoat's right, but the keeper anticipated and gathered the ball at
the second attempt.
Vinnie Moore rose to head the equaliser 13 minutes from time.
Clyde's 500 travelling fans came to see what impact Nicholas could
make on their team. It took only 26 minutes for his Clyde career to take
off in spectacular fashion, pouncing on a poor clearance just outside
the box and chipping the ball into the net.
Manager Alex Smith described it as ''a typical Nicholas goal'' and
revealed that his plan will be for the former Celtic man to operate
sometimes as an out-and-out striker, while on other occasions to play
behind the front men.
''I enjoyed that and I liked the way we played football,'' said
Nicholas. ''There's a different kind of responsibility for me now with
Clyde.''
Ayr player-manager Simon Stainrod has been busy signing players and
pointed out that half of his team were playing together for the first
time on Saturday. He also has half-a-dozen of his squad on the injured
list.
Another veteran, Eamonn Bannon, wore the No.2 jersey for Stenhousemuir
at Dumfries, where Queen of the South hit back twice for a 2-2 draw.
Stirling Albion, whose 3-0 home win over Montrose was made easier when
Craig Mailer was sent off just after the interval for handling a
net-bound header, have re-signed midfielder Craig Taggart.
Forfar missed a penalty when the game was goalless in the 2-0 home
defeat by East Fife, a match in which referee Ian Taylor booked eight
players.
In Division 3, Livingston remain the only team in Scotland never to
have lost a game. The new club again visited one of manager Jim
Leishman's teams and came away victorious, from Inverness this time, by
beating Caley Thistle 3-0.
Brechin hit back to defeat East Stirlingshire 3-1, while Johnston
Bellshaw and visitor Ian Maxwell were sent off in Ross County's 2-0 home
win over injury hit Queen's Park.

John Anderson is a Scottish banker who became an international arms
dealer. Brian Wilson traces the extraordinary transition and suggests
those interested in the truth about arms for Iran and Iraq should start
by listening to his story
LATE last month, John Anderson was called to Glasgow by the
Investigation Branch of Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. For the period
of questioning he was placed under arrest and, when it was over, he was
told by his two inquisitors that he was now ''unarrested''. He went back
home to Fort Augustus.
Around the same time, his former business colleague, Gerald James, was
having much the same experience in London. The content and circumstances
of these interviews were the stuff of fiction -- but they were just the
latest episodes in the wider drama which has engulfed these two men.
On this occasion, they say, their interrogators were interested in
just two lines of inquiry -- whether they possess evidence which proves
that one of their companies, BMARC, traded illegally in arms with Iran
(which it certainly did), and the role of Jonathan Aitken, former Chief
Secretary to the Treasury and previously a BMARC director.
At the end of the sessions, there were no charges against Anderson and
James, just as there have been none against them since the Ministry of
Defence police first raided the premises of BMARC's parent company,
Astra plc, five years ago. They were, however, forced out by
institutional shareholders and, in 1993, Astra went into administration.
Anderson's arrest last month at least lacked the drama of a previous
encounter with the authorities, following the initial raid. Then, he was
taken from Fort Augustus by two police officers and driven at high speed
to Glasgow, where he was put on a plane to Gatwick.
A police car then set off at even higher speed for Ramsgate and duly
crashed into another car. The next day, a shaken and injured Anderson
was asked a few routine questions before being put on the plane back
home. He still suffers neck pains as a result of the accident and
continues to pursue a settlement from the police.
It is the kind of bizarre story which crops up routinely in any
conversation with Anderson or James. For whatever reasons, the
authorities decided five years ago that they should be cast as outsiders
-- ostracised, ridiculed, investigated, discredited, pursued.
Coincidentally or not, their troubles began soon after Astra blew the
whistle on the Iraq supergun affair, when they found that a Belgian firm
which they had taken over was supplying propellants for the project. The
question of whether Anderson and James are guilty of any offences in the
way their companies operated remains to be tested in court, if it ever
gets there.
In the meantime, their hitherto successful business has been brought
to its knees. The Department of Trade and Industry has spent, according
to a parliamentary answer, more that #2.7m on investigating it. When MoD
police raided Astra they took away enough files to fill two large
warehouses. Now it is Customs and Excise who are doing the questioning.
Seldom can the various agencies of government have amassed so much
information about any company. Yet the astonishing contention on which
ministers now routinely rely is that none of them told the others about
what they had found.
There are two possible reasons for the treatment of Anderson and
James. The first, whispered knowingly by certain Tory MPs to anyone who
will listen, is that they are supposed to be paranoid fantasists who got
in above their depth in the arms trade, ran Astra and its subsidiaries
along lines so improper as to justify their removal and subsequent
pursuit, and are now utterly unreliable purveyors of far-fetched
stories.
The second theory is that they know most of what there is to know
about the illegal arms dealings of the late 1980s and early 1990s with
Iran and Iraq, including where the vast commissions went. The last thing
which many people want is that their testimony should be heard or, worse
still, taken seriously. So they have been ruthlessly, relentlessly
marginalised.
MOST of us grew up with the name Astra. They were the company who made
bangers and rockets to celebrate Guy Fawkes Day. When James and Anderson
bought it in 1981, Astra was owned by two elderly Jewish gentlemen who
employed 38 people at Sandwich in Kent, calling in extra staff to cope
with seasonal demand as November 5 approached.
Anderson is a 64-year-old native of Balloch who did his stint in the
RAF and then spent 20 years working for the Bank of Scotland. In the
early 1970s he was based in the bank's foreign section in Glasgow and
then became a manager in the international department in London. By the
end of the decade he was fed up with banking and was looking for a new
challenge.
Via a Christmas card, he renewed his acquaintance with James, a
merchant banker with a Monday Club pedigree, and they teamed up as a
consultancy. Anderson knew his way round the complex world of
international credit and export guarantees. Their first commission was
to advise another fireworks company, Brock's, who had moved north to
Sanquhar.
Brock's had received orders from Nigeria and Malaysia for
thunderflashes and smoke grenades. They then ran into difficulty in
obtaining payment. Having had past dealings with Anderson, they asked
him to help. That job, he recalls, took just a couple of days to sort
out. But the lesson stayed with him -- if you can make a firework, you
can make a thunderflash, and indeed every other explosive device
involved in the conduct of war.
The crucial assets held by the firework makers were explosives
licences. When, soon afterwards, Astra came on the market, James and
Anderson tried to act as brokers for a sale to a German company. When
that fell through, they decided to buy it themselves and develop the
company's untapped potential for entering the arms trade. At the same
time, Astra carried on making fireworks.
IN TERMS both of business expansion and the ethos of the eighties, the
new-look Astra was a terrific success. James and Anderson proved to be
highly effective salesmen as they toured the arms fairs of the world,
with enthusiastic encouragement from the British Government. The DTI
provided them with assistance and made the contacts for them to wine and
dine.
Signal cartridges for the US Army; smoke grenades for Abu Dhabi;
practice bombs for the RAF -- the orders flowed and Astra was soon
looking to acquire smaller companies which would facilitate expansion.
First they bought the Chicago-based Walters Group which engaged in
precision engineering and fuse manufacture.
This was followed in 1988 by BMARC -- British Manufacture and Research
Co -- a long-established company based in Mrs Thatcher's home town of
Grantham. Finally, and fatefully, they bought one of the world's oldest
explosives companies, PRB, a Belgian propellant manufacturer which
proved to be up to its neck in the Iraq supergun.
By any standards, this was big-time stuff which left Astra and its
subsidiaries employing more than 2000 people. No company can operate,
far less expand so aggressively, in this trade without attracting the
interest of government agencies, including the intelligence services.
This was particularly true, Anderson recalls, after the Howe doctrine of
December 1984 concerning the Iran-Iraq war.
Supposedly, that put a British ''deadly weapons'' embargo in place. It
is now beyond reasonable doubt that throughout the Iran-Iraq war, the
embargo was honoured mainly in the breach. By one route or another, many
of the leading players in the British arms industry contributed to the
conflagration. Britain's reputation was as a relatively easy source of
export licences.
Some companies, in the highest traditions of the arms trade, helped to
arm both sides in the war, and one of these companies was BMARC.
BMARC's dealings with Iran were inherited from Oerlikon, the Swiss
company which had previously owned BMARC and had signed up for Project
Lisi -- an epic order which involved supplying almost 200 naval cannon
to Iran, via Singapore. When Astra acquired BMARC in 1988, the company
was already two years into Project Lisi.
Anderson recalls that, when he visited the Grantham factory, there was
common talk of the ''Iran order''. Anderson claims that when he
challenged this he was told that it was nonsense and that Singapore was
the true destination.
Anderson continues to find it remarkable that, on obtaining the
biggest order in BMARC's history, Major General Donald Isles, the BMARC
deputy managing director -- previously director of munitions at the
British Embassy in Washington and director general of weapons for the
Army -- did not consult Jane's Fighting Ships which might have cast
doubt on Singaporean demand for naval cannon.
BOOKS could, and doubtless will be, written on the mind-boggling
detail of who sold what to whom, via where and with whose knowledge and
acquiescence during the late 1980s and early 90s. It is possible that,
as Alan Clark might argue, the great British public neither knows nor
cares about the details of such arrangements; particularly when they
come to light several years after the event.
Indeed, arms for Iraq might have ended up as a murky episode of
interest only to aficionados of such matters if it had not been for the
inescapable fact that several ministers in Her Majesty's Government were
prepared to see three men go to jail rather than cough up the
inconvenient truth that the company had been operating with the full
knowledge of British Intelligence.
As a result of this disclosure and the furore which ensued, John Major
appointed Sir Richard Scott to enquire into arms for Iraq. The crucial
question is why Scott's remit did not also include arms for Iran, which
would have taken him straight into the affairs of BMARC and all the
ramifications which flowed from them.
Subsequently, and ostensibly in reply to my questions, Michael
Heseltine made his dramatic parliamentary statement. The House of
Commons, he proclaimed, had been inadvertently misled on a number of
occasions about BMARC and arms for Iran. He had now become aware, as a
result of inquiries which he had instigated, that cannon supposedly
bound for Singapore under Project Lisi may have ended up in Iran.
While the media excited itself over Heseltine's cleverness in keeping
himself clean on another potentially messy issue and speculation mounted
over what Aitken should or must have known in his role as a BMARC
non-executive director, his former colleagues in that company --
including Anderson -- shook their heads in disbelief at the farce which
was unfolding.
They had, after all, told the DTI about Project Lisi several years
earlier. There were plenty of grounds for believing that the
intelligence services had known everything there was to know about
Project Lisi from the word go. James had again spelt out the details in
his evidence to the trade and industry select committee in 1992.
But above all, there were these two warehouses full of files taken
from the Astra offices which Anderson and James have maintained all
along could set out the full picture. This gold-dust had been in the
hands of the MoD police since 1990, yet we are invited to believe that
neither the DTI nor Customs and Excise availed themselves of it, in
spite of all the forensic examination of BMARC's affairs which they
themselves have been engaged in.
Somehow -- in spite of James's efforts to tell them; in spite of the
Astra files; in spite of a #2.7m DTI investigation into the company; in
spite of the intelligence reports -- ministers had avoided knowing the
significance of Project Lisi at the time the Scott Inquiry was
established, and right up to the point at which Heseltine made his
statement.
Now, having been struck by a thunderbolt of enlightenment, Heseltine
has ensured that arms for Iran will not be investigated by a full-scale
judicial inquiry, but by the trade and industry select committee --
several of whose Tory members have been among the most active
disparagers of Anderson and James.
It is as clear as anything can be that arms for Iran and BMARC should
have been as much part of the Scott Inquiry as arms for Iraq and Matrix
Churchill. Anderson is in no doubt that such an inconvenient outcome was
avoided not on the basis of Project Lisi being a mystery which was only
later discovered, but through a systematic determination to ignore and
suppress available evidence.
If the sword of truth is ever to prevail, it would not be a bad idea
for Anderson's next trip from Fort Augustus to be to the warehouses full
of files to which he has been denied access since 1990. If the
information which would verify his version of events is indeed to be
found there, then even more serious questions will be begged of those
who have kept them under wraps for so long.

ANDY Goram was at pains to make it clear he was not walking out on
Scotland, who are about to play their most important match since the
qualifying series for the last World Cup finals.
The Rangers goalkeeper says he is ''not 100% upstairs'', and would be
more of a liability than an asset against the Greeks at Hampden on
Wednesday night.
''I am not walking out. I would never quit Scotland,'' he said, and
all over the country supporters of the national side, the foot-soldiers
who travel the world under the banner of the Tartan Army, would have
been shaking their heads in disbelief.
Goram could try to explain his decision to stand aside from now until
his dying days, but he will never convince the majority of fans his
action did not amount to a snub.
Too much had gone on before he arrived at Hampden on Saturday morning
to tell the national team manager, Craig Brown, of his change of heart,
and defending Goram with gusto and conviction would be a challenge even
Clarence Darrow might have declined.
The keeper was at his sharpest when Rangers won 1-0 against Anorthosis
in the first leg of their Champions' Cup preliminary tie last midweek,
and almost immediately after that match said in a radio interview he
didn't want to play in a game in which he might be injured and left
unavailable for Rangers' crucial second match against the Cypriots.
The following day Goram told Brown he was willing to play against the
Greeks. ''He said he was up for that match,'' the manager pointed out,
yet the keeper felt differently a couple of days later. Goram struggled
to explain himself and Brown, who left the player to make the
announcement of his withdrawal from the squad, sat looking perplexed.
Perplexed? He should have been livid. Goram is one of the most
important components of Scotland's team, and to lose him in such a
manner was hard to take.
It wasn't necessary for anyone to trot out doctors and psychiatrists
to tell us about the dangers of operating in high-pressure environments,
because we all know sports people at the sharp end walk a tightrope, and
the slightest possible change to a routine can reduce them to whimpering
heaps.
Indeed, we all live with pressure, especially people who are
unemployed or struggling below the poverty line, yet many of them will
be at Hampden come Wednesday.
Football is their escape and Goram has said he, too, forgets all about
his concerns when he pulls on his keeper's gloves. Has it really all
become too much for this bold, brash, and gallus individual?
Brown believes it has, and so too does Scotland's goalkeeping guru
Alan Hodgkinson, who is closer to Goram than anyone outside his own
home, and they say there will be no recriminations, no grudges.
That's fine and proper because mental illness can be as serious as any
physical ailment, and if Goram is crumbling under the strain then he
deserves all our sympathies.
More than Rangers fans will be waiting to see if his mind will be
straight and uncluttered in time for Saturday's Coca-Cola Cup tie
against Morton and still clear a week on Wednesday when the Ibrox side
play the second leg of their preliminary-round tie.
His mental problem could be expunged as quickly as it invaded his
head, but if he plays in Cyprus and performs his usual heroics, he will
leave himself open to further criticism. So, too, will Brown, who missed
an opportunity to strengthen his own credibility by making it clear to
Goram his problem might have ended his international career.
Wonderful keeper that he is, Goram, who says he would like to be
considered for the next match, which will be against Finland in
September, must be made absolutely certain of what will be required
before he can be welcomed back to the national team.
At the very least he should be told that unless he produces evidence
he has sought help to overcome his psychological problem he can't be
considered for a place because the national team, which is short of
genuine talent, needs to make up for deficiences through camaraderie and
unity.
Brown has a responsibility to other players, and also to the
supporters, and while saying he understood Goram's plight the manager
should have stressed there would be no straightforward road back.
Brown should have been stronger and ought to have taken a stance, if
only to prevent an outbreak of mental illness within the squad.
Besides, has not insanity, especially among keepers, been a
prerequisite in this business? Any attempts to make it a fashionable
escape from national service must be resited.

THE Norse gods, one of whose names is the origin of the Ullevi Stadium
here, must have looked down in satisfaction as the World Athletics
Championship battleground fell silent last night.
The javelin, appropriately in view of the arena's ancient pre-historic
roots, brought Britain silver from a rejuvenated Steve Backley, and
there was bronze from gallant soldier Kelly Holmes in the 800 metres.
But Britain's final medal tally, six, in thirteenth place overall, was
our poorest since the championships began in 1983. Analysed by the
number of places in finals -- perhaps a better guide to the health of
the sporting nation -- the UK was fourth overall.
If Britain is to stage the 2001 championships, as it was confirmed
last night they hope to do, then Backley's javelin, and Britain's other
successes on a shoestring, must be used to goad Government assistance.
Ullr, stepson of the thunder god, Thor, is the Viking deity to whom
the stadium owes its name. He was the god of hunting -- with spear, and
bow and arrow -- celebrated in the sagas.
The arena named in his memory was a fitting place for the conflict
between five of the six best spear-throwers ever, including former world
record-holder Backley, and Jan Zelezny, the holder.
Any one of three Zelezny efforts, the best of which was 89.58 metres,
would have won, but it was a final-round 86.30m by Backley, his best for
three seasons, which edged him ahead of Boris Henry, Germany's world
all-time No.2, to snatch silver.
With his famed yellow pages packing his shoes, to help his lop-sided
posture, Backley responded to a marvellous challenge. ''I am now in as
good shape as I was before all the injuries,'' he said afterwards,
vowing: ''I will be around for another 10 years.''
Noureddine Morceli won his third successive 1500m crown no less
majestic for all its predictability, though some will wonder at the
suicide tactics of American outsider Paul McMullen, whose 57.43sec
opening lap made it particularly easy for the world record-holder.
In the past, the Algerian has been accused of paying for a pace-maker
in championship finals. Here Morceli's last 300m, in 38.04, was more
than sufficient. Britain's Gary Lough was ninth in 3-37.59.
The 20-year-old Kenyan, Ismael Kirui, who set a world junior best to
win the 5000m title two years ago, was: ''prepared to run inside 13
minutes'' to retain his crown. But in the event, 13-16.77, with 26.54
for the final half lap, was devastating. The first six places went to
Africans, with Britain's John Nuttall fourteenth in 13-49.35.
Stefka Kostadinova cleared 2.01m, robbing Alina Astafei of a memorable
high jump success.
The Canadian relay squad sacrificed the chance of $50,000 to make sure
of gold in the 4 x 110m. They used $4500 of their $36,000 development
budget to take out insurance against breaking the world record.
The squad, led by 100m champion Donovan Bailey, felt sure they could
relieve the USA of their mark of 37.40, but in the end settled for safe
batton changes and victory in 38.31.
The USA, who never previously had lost this title, failed to make the
final, as did the UK. The Americans ran out of the take-over box, thanks
to an appalling baton-change between John Drummond and Theodore McCall.
Linford Christie had identified that the USA squad was ''vulnerable''
but Britain -- silver and bronze medal winners in the past two
championships -- also flopped.
Mel Neef ran her fastest 400m, 50.80 on the opening leg for Britain,
superior to the Scottish record (551.16), but relays do not count. The
team finished fifth, as were the men's squad, but they were only .57 off
the bronze place.
With 24 countries winning gold, and 43 taking medals, it was the
widest spread of titles and medals ever.
For Britain, with Christie injured, and Jackson and Gunnell
unavailable to defend titles, the final tally was respectable, though
not what one would wish for a nation with host aspirations.
Professor Peter Radford, the British Athletics Federation chairman,
confirmed last night that he has had fruitful talks with officials of
the world governing body here. ''I am very encouraged that Britain will
host the 2001 world championships,'' he revealed.
This will depend, however, on Lottery backing for a new national
stadium, details of which will be announced in November. There is no
suitable British arena. World athletics rules demand a 60,000 all-seater
stadium in a 1m population city.
''If we are to maintain our status in future, a radical change in
attitude is needed in the funding of athletics by the Government and its
agencies,'' warned UK coaching director Malcolm Arnold last night.
He said that other governments ''continue to back their athletes with
realistic funding. At these champs, it has been evident that small
nations are targeting particular areas, and achieving significant
success . . . this country gets a much greater return in results and
medals than its financial investment.
''If Britain is to host the world championships in 2001, now is the
time to begin preparation of a team which Britain can be proud of.''

Dundee United 1, Morton 1
IN the not too distant past, the threat of conflict had governments
spending millions on early warning systems. The first division, in terms
of the war coming up this season, may not be regarded as in the nuclear
class, but even after one game, it is obviously a bomb waiting to
explore.
Dundee United's players were told before they met Morton at Tannadice
to forget about forecasts that they were certainties to climb back up to
the premier division.
Manager Billy Kirkwood had made sure of that. But footballers, being
somewhat fickle folk who often think they know better, sometimes have to
be given a lesson or two. A sort of retraining in the ways of the real
football world.
United and their supporters were given that on Saturday as almost 7000
folk turned up to see them begin to ease their way back upstairs. And
after dropping two points so early in the season, Kirkwood was the first
to admit: ''We've got to learn from this. We'll be up against this for
the remainder of the season. Teams who come here and see our facilities
and pitch will raise their game. We must show that we are better. We
were under no illusions about this league and today proved the point.''
With new signings Steven Pressley, Ally Maxwell, Sandy Robertson, and
Neil Caldwell in impressive form, United looked better in the first
half. Craig Brewster added to that feeling after 22 minutes when he put
them ahead after the Morton defence failed to clear an Andy McLaren
corner.
It then seemed to be sit-back-and-wait time for more goals to follow.
After all, Morton, as mere second division champions, were visiting a
side fresh from the helter-skelter of premier division football. Even
the noisy and impressive Greenock support -- around 1000 -- suddenly
fell silent.
But Morton kept their cool, altered their formation from three to two
up front after the break, and most importantly continued not only to
play themselves out of trouble, but to cause problems to Maurice Malpas,
as sweeper, Pressley, and company.
David Wylie in the Morton goal, who had not looked his usual steady
self in the first half, made amends with two cracking saves later on.
But when it comes down to crackers then it will take some strike to beat
Alan Mahood's 30-yard equaliser after 65 minutes for a best-goal
competition.
Even Kirkwood, when bemoaning his side's missed chances, admitted it
was ''a wonder goal.'' And while expressing ''delight'' at gaining a
point, Allan McGraw said of Mahood: ''The lad missed a week's pre-season
training. I'm expecting much more from him. Just give him a couple of
months.''
While on the time capsule, McGraw was not getting too carried away
with the result. ''The first game of any season can bring strange
results, lads playing above themselves. Ask me again in six weeks' time
and I'll have a good idea of where we are going.
''No team will enjoy coming to Tannadice this season. They will be
frightened to come here and rightly so. But what makes this league so
good is that everyone feels that they can beat one another.''
Listening to the McGraw philosophy, and watching his team's style,
were Walter Smith -- back in familiar territory -- and assistant Archie
Knox of Rangers.
Morton must visit Ibrox on Saturday on Coca-Cola Cup business, but
McGraw's quiet, determined attitude, no matter what league or
competition he encounters, is always the same. ''We do not fear anyone.
We'll enjoy the occasion next week. Let's face it, we've nothing to
loose.''
The Rangers manager reminded the press corps about the game against St
Mirren tonight, saying he will send out a strong team, including Paul
Gascoigne.'' That should make Love Street a busy wee place.

ALTHOUGH they were far removed from the heat of the day and of the
battle, the American professionals Brad Faxon, Fred Couples, and Masters
champion Ben Crenshaw yesterday enlivened the early stages of the final
round of the US PGA Championship -- respectively with an outward half of
28, seven under par, and scores of 66 and 67 in continuing bright
sunshine and soft breezes.
Faxon, aged 34, who was seventh in last year's Open Championship at
Turnberry, lies fourteenth on the US Ryder Cup points list and would
make the team were he to finish at least equal fifth. From five under at
the start Faxon proceeded to 12 under with an eagle 3 and five birdies
to equal Denis Durnian's 1983 figure at Royal Birkdale as the lowest in
championship history.
Jose-Maria Olazabal, as Faxon's partner an eye-witness, had his
creditable 33, two under, put in the shade, but the Spaniard's presence
at all, let alone that he was now seven under for the tournament, was
remarkable, for he had almost withdrawn on Wednesday, when he added a
back ailment to his foot injury.
Couples, plagued by his back injury for much of the season since he
won the first two events on the European tour, had a rush of five
birdies in six holes from the fifth at the Riviera Country Club's
6949-yard course, where he twice won the Los Angeles Open. From a start
of even par he went to seven under but bogeyed two of the last six
holes.
Crenshaw also had his lowest round of the championship, which included
successive 2s -- an eagle at the 421-yard thirteenth and a birdie at the
short fourteenth.
Nick Faldo, whose decision to campaign almost exclusively on the US
tour began so promisingly with his victory at Doral in February, was
round in 67 for a total of 279. His latest example of fine-tuning,
incidentally, has been to abandon the cross-handed putting grip for the
conventional type.
All these labours were under way, or over, well before the leaders set
out -- Ernie Els, on 197, a whopping 16 under par, attempting to make a
three-stroke lead stand up against the threat of Jeff Maggert and Mark
O'Meara, and of Colin Montgomerie, the only realistic European
contender, albeit at a five-stroke distance.
The first hole, a highly accessible par-5 of 503 yards, duly fell to
Montgomerie's second to the back of the green, but O'Meara, his partner,
was bunkered in two and had to make do with par. However, behind them in
the last group, Els had a stroke of the fortune which has made him seem
destined to win.
Els pushed his second and the ball sank into the short course rough.
However, because of its proximity to a sprinkler head, Els was granted a
free drop and from a much kinder lie he chipped to within inches to move
to 17 under, still three ahead of Maggert.

NORWICH captain Jon Newsome scored twice as the visitors got their
Division 1 campaign off to a winning start at Luton yesterday. Norwich,
relegated from the Premiership last term, came under early pressure but
they weathered the storm and almost took the lead after 12 minutes
through Adeola Akinbiyi, but his striker went wide.
Newsome made the breakthrough two minutes later after good work from
Mark Bowen. Luton were awarded a penalty eight minutes into the second
half, and Bontcho Guentchev scored his first goal for the club from the
spot.
In 55 minutes, Norwich regained the initiative, Newsome scoring with
another header. Then Neil Adams made sure with a third goal after 69
minutes, firing home a scorching 45-yard shot.
Derby launched their Division 1 campaign with a firework display --
but the 0-0 draw with Port Vale turned out to be more of a damp squib.
The pre-match spectacle which marked the opening of a new stand easily
outshone a colourless game that contained few moments of quality.
Vale had the better openings but #450,000 signing from York Jon
McCarthy wasted the best chance.
Derby's new look side, which had shaped up impressively in pre-season,
struggled to find any rhythm against a tenacious Vale team and rarely
troubled Paul Musselwhite.

AN injury to Fraserburgh striker Paul Keith overshadowed action in the
Highland League Cup at the weekend, with Keith seriously-ill in hospital
after having suffered a collapsed lung.
An innocent collision with Cove Rangers keeper Ray Charles half an
hour into the game left Keith with three broken ribs and a punctured
lung, but his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.
Keith should make a full recovery, but the news of his injury clouded
Fraserburgh's surprise 5-1 triumph against the cup holders.
There were other surprises. Nairn County defeated last season's beaten
finalists Lossiemouth, Alan MacDonald (2) and Maurice MacMillan securing
a 3-1 win after Lossie's Steve Gerrard opened the scoring.
Rothes stunned Peterhead with a 2-1 away win. Colin Smith's opener was
answered by a goal from Scott Shephard, before Ricky Thomson grabbed a
late winner.
Surprise No.4 came as Fort William ran riot up at Wick Academy,
winning 6-1 with a double from Alan Muir. And Clach disposed of league
dark horses Brora Rangers 2-0, with goals from Stuart Golabeck and Gavin
Dearie.
Buckie beat Deveronvale 3-0 at home, and only Huntly's tight 2-1 win
away to Keith and Elgin's 2-0 victory at Forres added a touch of reality
to the scoresheets.

Theo Snelders' refusal to play for Aberdeen in their final preparatory
game against Coventry City on Saturday will earn him a maximum #4000
fine and ultimately bring to an end his career at Pittodrie.
The Aberdeen board is incensed at what they perceive was a gross act
of unprofessionalism on the part of their keeper. He will be put on the
transfer list -- but only when the timing suits their purposes.
Aberdeen, with an impending share issue, do not want to be seen to be
selling another of their main assets which could affect the launch. When
he does go, the price will be in excess of #1m for a player regarded as
one of the best in the country.
Club manager Roy Aitken now will discipline Snelders then ascertain
his attitude to continue playing for the club.
At the root of Snelders' grievance is his belief that he had an
agreement with Aberdeen that he could move if a bigger club came for
him. Snelders knows of Rangers interest and would welcome the
opportunity to join the Scottish champions.
Aitken, without money to spend on rebuilding his team until the share
launch is completed, is loth to lose such an important player.
''When I told Snelders before the match that he was not for sale and
that I saw him as a major player for this club in the remaining year of
his contract, he made it clear he did not want to play against
Coventry,'' said Aitken.
''I will be meeting with him again on Monday to find out what he is
thinking, but at the end of the day I have always stressed that I only
want players here who want to play for this club.''
As if this was not enough to concern a young manager embarking on his
first full season in charge, Aitken now has to re-think his plans after
a thoroughly inept performance in losing 5-1 to Coventry.

In a challenge to Einstein's theory that space travel beyond the speed
of light is impossible, an astronomer believes 'wormholes' could provide
rapid access to distant parts of the universe, writes Sarah Vincent.
PEOPLE could eventually travel through space and time to the far
corners of the universe -- and possibly come face to face with aliens --
it will be claimed in a paper to be published by the Royal Astronomical
Society.
The report, by astronomer Dr Ian Crawford of University College,
London, challenges one of the fundamentals of modern science -- that it
is theoretically impossible to travel faster than the speed of light.
Scientists have generally accepted this for decades, since Einstein
proved that the mass of an object increases as its speed increases.
Ultimately, when an object approaches the speed of light -- which
travels at 300,000km a second -- its mass becomes infinitely big, so
that no amount of extra energy can make it go any faster.
Dr Crawford's paper, Some Thoughts on the Implications of
Faster-Than-Light Interstellar Space Travel, will appear in next month's
edition of the Quarterly Journal of the society.
In his report, which has passed strict vetting procedures by two
independent referees in order to appear in the journal, Dr Crawford
claims that faster-than-light (FTL) travel may in fact be possible.
Laws of physics, including Einstein's theories of relativity, would
still apply in the everyday universe in which we live, where FTL is not
possible. But Dr Crawford suggests that there may be exceptional
structures -- known as wormholes -- within the universe where space and
time are governed by different laws.
These wormholes, which have been the subject of wide speculation for
the past 20 years, are effectively wrinkles in space and time, which act
as short cuts between distant points in the universe.
Dr Crawford does not claim to have proved that FTL is possible, but he
suggests that physicists should keep an open mind. He writes: ''There
are reasons for believing that FTL interstellar space travel may be
consistent with the laws of physics.
''For many space exploration and colonisation projects that we might
wish to undertake in the future it would be a great help if space
vehicles could travel faster than the speed of light. We simply do not
know whether FTL travel is possible.''
Dr Simon Mitton, an astronomer at Cambridge University and a member of
the Royal Astronomical Society, said it was an ''interesting''
development. He said: ''I think it is good when scientists draw
attention to the fact that our thinking has been running along very
straight tracks and we may be overlooking unusual and different
circumstances.
''Some people in the scientific community think this research is
rather unorthodox and flaky. I don't hold this view. I think these are
legitimate areas of inquiry and it will excite a lot of interest among
the general public.''

LESS than three years ago, Anna Fidelia Quirot lay close to death,
with the Cuban head of state, Fidel Castro, by her bedside, writes Doug
Gillon. A kerosene stove had exploded as the Olympic and world 800
metres medallist tried to light it, and 38% burns covered her face,
neck, shoulders, arms and hands.
Incredibly, yesterday Quirot took the world 800m title, timed at 1min
56.11sec, with Britain's Kelly Holmes smashing the UK and Commonwealth
records to take bronze behind Letitia Vriesde of Surinam.
Quirot, who before the tragedy which permanently scarred her and cost
the life of her child, had never won a world title, was helped by the
disqualification in the semis of 42-race unbeaten Maria Mutolo. But even
the Mozambique woman would have struggled in the face of the Cuban's
courage and determination.
''In my worst moments, I never believed I could come back so
strongly,'' she said. ''This is the most beautiful victory of my life.
My home village is expecting me with open arms, and we will have a grand
fiesta.''
At the time of her accident, Quirot was pregnant with a child
fathered, she says, by world high-jump record-holder Javier Sotomayor.
The child, born prematurely, died after a week, but was christened
Javiana.
Sotomayor has never refuted her claims, maintaining a dignified
silence. Quirot, it has long been suspected, had attempted to commit
suicide because Sotomayor had changed his mind about leaving his wife to
live with her.
''Bull-shit,'' she said, denying the suicide rumour outright.
Surgeons have been stunned by the pace of her recovery. There have
been seven skin-graft operations to date, and five more are planned. But
she has deferred these ''until after the Atlanta Olympics, when I will
retire.''
She was due to compete only in the relay here, until 20 days ago, but
then she ran Mutola close in the Monte Carlo grand prix. Cuban
officials, including former double Olympic champion Alberto Juantorena,
persuaded her to try the 800m.
Yesterday, the towering Juantorena grabbed her on the track, swept her
up, and spun her in his arms, before snatching a Cuban flag from the
crowd, and enshrouding her tortured figure.
It was all a dream to the 32-year old, after the nightmare of January,
1993. ''I am here thanks to the doctors in Cuba, and the help of my
family and coach,'' she said. ''They have made me what I am today.
''For a few months I could not bear to look at myself. I was so ugly .
. . so ugly.'' But last night, gloriously, she had shed all her
inhibitions, smiling, laughing, and giggling.
She was actually running within four months of the accident, and was
runner-up in the Central American Championships 11 months after it, even
though the tight scar tissue made every step agony.
Castro, after whom she is named, said then: 'She has won silver, but
she gets the gold medal for bravery.'' Now he is likely to make a
special award to her.
Army sergeant Holmes had already been on parade to collect silver in
the 1500m, Britain's only double medal winner. But the four earlier
races in her legs took their toll. Quirot and Vriesde stormed past, and
then France's Patricia Djate came alongside. ''I just fought and fought,
all the way to the line. I really wanted it,'' Holmes said, after her
record-breaking 1-56.95 had held off Djate.

A MYSTERY being may pull out of a public meeting in October where he
was due to reveal the secrets of the universe.
Falkirk councillor Billy Buchanan claimed the media had ridiculed his
efforts to stage the event in Falkirk Town Hall to such an extent that
the man in black known as Zal-us may now be ''scared off''.
He said: ''I'm being made out to be an idiot. But I'm sincere in what
I'm doing. I want the meeting to go ahead but I'm afraid the man I've
been seeing may want to pull out.''
Councillor Buchanan, of Bonnybridge, Stirlingshire, said he had met
with Zal-us, who claimed he belonged to a shadowy group known as the
Council of Nine which watches over Earth.

LESS than three years ago, Anna Fidelia Quirot lay close to death,
with the Cuban head of state, Fidel Castro, by her bedside, writes Doug
Gillon. A kerosene stove had exploded as the Olympic and world 800
metres medallist tried to light it, and 38% burns covered her face,
neck, shoulders, arms and hands.
Incredibly, yesterday Quirot took the world 800m title, timed at 1min
56.11sec, with Britain's Kelly Holmes smashing the UK and Commonwealth
records to take bronze behind Letitia Vriesde of Surinam.
Quirot, who before the tragedy which permanently scarred her and cost
the life of her child, had never won a world title, was helped by the
disqualification in the semis of 42-race unbeaten Maria Mutolo. But even
the Mozambique woman would have struggled in the face of the Cuban's
courage and determination.
''In my worst moments, I never believed I could come back so
strongly,'' she said. ''This is the most beautiful victory of my life.
My home village is expecting me with open arms, and we will have a grand
fiesta.''
At the time of her accident, Quirot was pregnant with a child
fathered, she says, by world high-jump record-holder Javier Sotomayor.
The child, born prematurely, died after a week, but was christened
Javiana.
Sotomayor has never refuted her claims, maintaining a dignified
silence. Quirot, it has long been suspected, had attempted to commit
suicide because Sotomayor had changed his mind about leaving his wife to
live with her.
''Bull-shit,'' she said, denying the suicide rumour outright.
Surgeons have been stunned by the pace of her recovery. There have
been seven skin-graft operations to date, and five more are planned. But
she has deferred these ''until after the Atlanta Olympics, when I will
retire.''
She was due to compete only in the relay here, until 20 days ago, but
then she ran Mutola close in the Monte Carlo grand prix. Cuban
officials, including former double Olympic champion Alberto Juantorena,
persuaded her to try the 800m.
Yesterday, the towering Juantorena grabbed her on the track, swept her
up, and spun her in his arms, before snatching a Cuban flag from the
crowd, and enshrouding her tortured figure.
It was all a dream to the 32-year old, after the nightmare of January,
1993. ''I am here thanks to the doctors in Cuba, and the help of my
family and coach,'' she said. ''They have made me what I am today.
''For a few months I could not bear to look at myself. I was so ugly .
. . so ugly.'' But last night, gloriously, she had shed all her
inhibitions, smiling, laughing, and giggling.
She was actually running within four months of the accident, and was
runner-up in the Central American Championships 11 months after it, even
though the tight scar tissue made every step agony.
Castro, after whom she is named, said then: 'She has won silver, but
she gets the gold medal for bravery.'' Now he is likely to make a
special award to her.
Army sergeant Holmes had already been on parade to collect silver in
the 1500m, Britain's only double medal winner. But the four earlier
races in her legs took their toll. Quirot and Vriesde stormed past, and
then France's Patricia Djate came alongside. ''I just fought and fought,
all the way to the line. I really wanted it,'' Holmes said, after her
record-breaking 1-56.95 had held off Djate.

YET another scandal threatens to drag fallen giants Olympique
Marseille further into the gutter.
No sooner had their former player, Jean Pierre Papin, alleged that the
French champions had bribed two AC Milan players to win the 1993
European Cup, when fresh accusations were levelled against them at the
weekend.
These came from the Croatian agent Ljubomir Barin, currently in jail
for his part in the corruption which bankrupted Bordeaux.
Barin, one-time friend of the famous, and a high-flier, claims he was
instructed by the technical staff at Marseille to bribe the referee in a
European Cup game against AEK Athens in 1989.
He said the match official, the leading Austrian Helmut Kohl, who was
a close associate of his, accepted the bribe and Marseille drew the tie
to progress in the competition.
Kohl died of cancer two years later, but the allegations have launched
another investigation by both the French FA and UEFA. The latter has
also demanded an explanation from Papin.
The malaise is not confined to France. Theo Aalbers, treasurer of the
Belgian FA, is being held in custody on charges of sexual harrassment.
Following their success in the European Cup last season Ajax have been
forced to refuse requests from foreign coaches anxious to learn their
secrets and study their methods.
Instead, the Amsterdam club has produced a video of itsfamed youth
policy and itstraining programme.
At the same time, coach Louis van Gaal has named the two players to
replace Frank Rijkaard and Clarence Seedorf.
In teenagers Nordin Wooter and Kiki Musampa he is confident he has the
replacements to help retain the club's position as Europe's pre-eminent
side.
Van Gaal, who scared off Manchester United with a #10m demand for Marc
Overmars, said: ''These two boys will prove they can do the job of men
this season. They are very exciting talents.''
There is every reason to believe that Ajax will be even more
formidable. They toyed with Lazio to win their final preparatory game
and meet Feyenoord this week in the Dutch Super Cup.
Ruud Gullit, now with Chelsea, is convinced the Premiership will pose
an increasing threat to the domination of the European game by Serie A
sides.
Now in the final chapter of an outstanding career, the Dutchman, who
will occupy the role of sweeper, explained: ''When I was in Italy I
never believed the game here would develop so excitingly.
''Italy will always be a major power because there are so many
exceptional players, and the enormous support the game enjoys. But the
same is now happening in England and I am happy to be part of it.''
Atletico Bilbao have smashed the transfer record between Spanish
clubs, paying #3.2m to buy Real Sociedad's 17-year-old striker Joseba
Etxeberria.
Lybia's Colonel Ghadaffi has offered Juventus and Parma #2m to play
their Italian supercup match in Tripoli as a birthday gift for his
football-mad son.
Permission must be gained from UEFA who will be hoping the event is
more peaceful than the Austrian equivalent between Salzburg and Rapid
Vienna last week when three players were hospitalised with fractured
limbs.

HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX
DAMON Hill blasted back into the Formula One world championship title
chase yesterday after roaring to victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix.
Hill slashed his deficit to title holder Michael Schumacher to just 11
points after the German dramatically ground to a halt with less than
four laps left.
Schumacher's late setback allowed David Coulthard to clinch second
place to complete a tremendous double for Williams Renault.
''It has been a fantastic weekend,'' said Hill, who is expected to be
named on Wednesday as co-driver with Jacques Villeneuve in the team next
season at the expence of Coulthard.
The 34-year-old, who led from start to finish, was greeted by a sea of
Union Jack flags carried by his band of supporters in the crowd as he
celebrated the twelfth win of his career.
''This was the best win I've ever hard,'' admitted Hill. ''I was
puffed out mounting the podium, but when you get a reception like that
it's a tremendous feeling. It was just fantastic. Michael stopping was
obviously a bonus, but I would have won anyway.''
Disappointed Schumacher insisted he could still have won, despite a
problem with his refuelling rig which delivered just 10 litres of fuel
rather than 40 when he made his first stop.
The Ferrari-bound driver had to make another unscheduled stop just 10
laps later to take on more fuel from team-mate Johnny Herbert's rig, but
saw his race ended with an unexplained engine failure.
''There was a big problem with the machine and I had to run longer on
one set of tyres,'' said the German. I think I still could have won, but
the car just stopped -- I don't know what was wrong with it.''
Coulthard took advantage of Schumacher's engine failure to finish
second, but he was over 33 seconds adrift of Hill having helped his
team-mate in the early stages by holding up the world champion.
''It wasn't planned that way,'' said the Monaco-based Scot. ''I was
amazed at the pace Damon set early on and I just could not keep up with
him.''
Coulthard's third podium finish took him to fourth in the
championship, 16 points behind Hill, having leapfrogged over Benetton's
Johnny Herbert, who was fourth behind Gerhard Berger.
Final placings:
1, D Hill (Britain) Williams, 1hr 46min 25.721sec (average speed
106.79mph); 2, D Coulthard (Britain) Williams, at 33.398sec; 3, G Berger

INTER Milan have not yet given up hope of signing Eric Cantona.
Their president Massimo Moratti last night repeated his intention to
sign Manchester United's mercurial French striker if and when he becomes
available.
Moratti's comments came after he ahad watched Inter struggle to a 0-0
draw with PSV Eindhoven in a friendly in Livorno on Saturday night.
It was Inter's second goal-less draw in 48 hours, following their
stalemate with Arsenal at Highbury, and Moratti admitted they were weak
in attack, saying: ''We need a little something up front.''
Asked whether Cantona might provide the answer, the Inter chief
replied: ''It's not simple to work out what either the player or
Manchester want. If it's possible, we'll sign him.''
Cantona, banned from soccer worldwide until September 30 after his
kung-fu attack on a Crystal Palace fan at Selhurst Park in January, last
week asked United to release him from his new three-year contract.
United turned down the request and manager Alex Ferguson flew to Paris
and persuaded Cantona to stay.
The Italian transfer market closed last week. Anyone signed now cannot
play until November.
United, meanwhile, are believed to be having talks with Ukrainian club
Shaktyor Donetsk in an attempt to break the deadlock over Andrei
Kanchelskis's #5m move to Everton.
United froze the transfer last week when the winger's former club
demanded a #1m slice of the transfer fee.
However, Donetsk spokesman Mark Levetski has said: ''We have sent a
fax to United saying the position is negotiable. We are entitled to a
percentage. We really want it and we really need it at the club.''
United have refused to attend a Premier League arbitration panel today
that could have paved the way for Kanchelskis to become a Goodison
player before tomorrow's registration deadline for the first round of
the European Cup-winners' Cup.

St Johnstone 0, Dundee 2
ALAN Main walked slowly towards the parking area at McDiarmid Park on
Saturday evening, puzzlement on his face, alone with his thoughts. The
guy was having a bad day.
Just more than an hour earlier the St Johnstone keeper had -- somehow
-- managed to juggle the ball into his own net when little danger
threatened, presenting Dundee with the platform for this success.
After such a horrendous gaffe most of us would hanker after Scotty to
beam us up somewher -- anywhere -- to ease the embarrassment, but young
Alan just had to stand there and take it. And boy, was he forced to take
plenty.
Remembering that Main was a former employee of Dundee United, he
performed his moment of lunacy right in front of the Dundee supporters,
who never ceased to inform him that he was as useful as dandruff.
On the other hand, Gerry Britton was just happy the game was over. He
could hardly muster the energy to support his head as he chatted about
how he rounded off the scoring with a fine strike in 53 minutes. He had
just completed his first competitive game since April, was knackered,
but had performed splendidly, pleasing his overseer no little.
''I gave Gerry a bit of stick after the testimonial match last week,''
said Dundee manager Jim Duffy, ''but I thought he led the line well
today and scored a great goal, stuffing my words down my throat.''
In the meantime, a blond, bulky figure sat in the stand wearing what
could only be described as a loud demob suit, perhaps from the Martian
army, and chatting to whoever would listen.
Andy Rhodes, it seems, is not flavour of the month around McDiarmid
Park these days, but if St Johnstone are to be taken seriously it may be
prudent for them to play the best men available.
As their manager, Paul Sturrock, wrote in the match programme: ''Teams
with ambitions of winning Division 1 will have to scrap every inch of
the way.'' In such a tight league its never too early to start
scrapping.

SCOTLAND team manager Craig Brown behaved as if he was a man walking
on egg shells at yesterday's Hampden press conference.
Twenty-four hours earlier, he had suggested that walk-out keeper Andy
Goram, who had told the manager that he was not in the right mental
state to play against Greece, should, perhaps, seek counselling from a
psychologist.
Brown went so far as to say: ''If he was my player, I would get him to
go to see someone with more knowledge of what he is going through. He
might need counselling from a psychologist.''
Last night, Brown had changed tack over the controversial issue of
Goram's mental readiness to go in against the Greeks in the crucial
European Championship clash at Hampden on Wednesday.
''I never said he should see a psychologist,'' he claimed. ''All I was
trying to say was that, whatever is wrong with Andy at this moment, then
it is beyond me as a coach to understand it.
''Over the years you learn about injuries and the like but this is
something different. It is beyond me. I understand that Andy has a
problem about this game. I can accept that because he has told me so,
and while I tried to dissuade him from leaving the group, it was obvious
that he was under some kind of strain.
''I spoke to him, Alan Hodgkinson, who is very, very close to Andy,
spoke to him, and neither of us could change his attitude.''
But there seems no chance of it affecting Goram's Scotland future.
Brown had stressed that he would bear no grudges and he hoped the Ibrox
player would return to the fold for next month's match against Finland.
Last night SFA chief executive Jim Farry took an admirably
understanding stance. ''The circumstances will be discussed by the
International Committee this week,'' he said.
''We are entering into territory where we have no experience at all.
But I can assure everyone that we will look on this whole matter with
sympathy.
''This can happen to anyone in other walks of life when stress reaches
out and affects attitudes. We will hear what the team manager's view is,
listen to what the player said to him, and talk the whole matter
through.''
Brown says that the furore has not affected morale in the Scottish
camp. The man who will continue as keeper, Hibs' Jim Leighton, added:
''I have a lot of sympathy for Andy. I hope he has an injury-free season
and he gets back to joining the international squad.
''I know how I missed the international scene when I was out of it for
five years. But I am sure that Andy will be back. As for this week, I
believe it is going to be the most important game I have played in.''
The Greeks arrived in Glasgow yesterday, and claimed the absence of
Goram would make no difference.
Their manager, Costas Polkhroniou, shrugged: ''We know he is a good
goalkeeper -- but Scotland are fortunate enough to have two class men
for that position. I still remember Jim Leighton when he came on in
Athens and looked very, very good.
''We are more concerned about our own team, and Nicos Machlas, who
plays in Crete, has just joined the squad after we thought he would miss
this game because of injury.''
As the Greeks unexpectedly welcome a striker, so, too, do the Scots.
Rangers' veteran Ally McCoist has joined up after the loss of Duncan
Ferguson and John Spencer.
It is unlikely that McCoist will play from the start of the match, but
manager Brown emphasised yesterday that he will be on the bench in a
game the Scots must win.
McCoist said: ''It has been a long time out for me. I broke my leg in
April, 1993, in Lisbon and I never did want to go out with a 5-0 defeat
and a bad injury. That is not my style.
''I feel I could go out and play because, after the pre-season
training I did, I feel fitter now than I have done since that night in
Portugal.''

Dumbarton 1, Hamilton Academical 0
MAYBE it was not a huge comfort to Dumbarton and their fans, but at
least Murdo's last fling was a winning one. MacLeod will join Partick
Thistle within the next 24 hours to step up another rung in the ladder
of a career that seems certain to reach the highest level one day.
The former Celtic and Borussia Dortmund player finalised the
arrangements with the premier division side last night and will
supervise Thistle's first game next Saturday when they meet Berwick
Rangers in the Coca-Cola Cup.
He will be hoping his debut will be as successful as his valedictory
appearance as Sons' leader, which was also the club's first of the
season.
The peculiarities of the management carousel are well illustrated by
MacLeod's situation. Working to give Dumbarton the best chance to
consolidate their promotion to the first division, he signed two new
players on Friday. He will say cheerio to them today.
He also enthusiastically captured Chick Charnley, who made a pleasing
debut against Accies, the man who was freed by the club he now joins.
Confused? You might be if Murdo decides he wants Chick back at Fihill.
MacLeod's arrival in the premier division as a manager in his own
right follows a two-season stint with Dumbarton after being assistant to
Alex Miller with Hibs. He joins a growing band of young men who are
gradually taking over the management positions in the top league. At 36,
he is the same age as Roy Aitken, of Aberdeen, and Alex McLeish of
Motherwell, two years younger than Jimmy Nicholl of Raith Rovers and
Tommy Burns of Celtic.
Murdo, naturally, wanted to talk about how pleased he was with
Dumbarton's challenge in the first division, rather than speculate on
the next chapter in his own progress. ''I thought we did better in the
second half and, in the end, deserved the win. We had four new players
and it takes time to get to know each other.''
Charnley did best of them all, especially after the interval when the
pace had settled to allow him to use the ball rather than his legs. He
looked very comfortable at this level and might be set to enjoy a
lengthy twilight to his career.
There were times at Boghead when some of us felt we were caught in a
time warp. Was that not Craig Paterson, who used to be a Rangers and
Hibs man, playing for Accies? That was Sammy McGivern, who played for
everybody, in a Dumbarton jersey; Hugh Burns, who played for everybody
else, as well. Survivors all and still capable of doing a job.
Burns, in fact, was hard to miss. The full back suffered a cut in his
head during the first half and was bandaged so heavily he looked like
The Mummy From Hell. But a few yards of linen can't keep an old soldier
down. He had stitches put in the wound at half time, the bandage was
removed and he chipped in a peach of a goal in 65 minutes to give his
new team three points and a happy ending to a day that had begun
tragically when striker Hugh Ward had been injured in a car crash that
resulted in the death of his pal. If victory celebrations were muted, it
was understandable.
There were some decent peformances from the younger brigade as well as
the experienced lot. Roland Fabiani, at 23 and a former St Mirren
player, looked smart and fast at full back for Dumbarton, while
Hamilton's Martin McIntosh and Pauil Hartley did well.
Both sides could have a hard job getting into the very heart of the
promotion chase for the premier division, but look capable of putting up
a good show against the best of them.

Clydebank 1, St Mirren 1
BOTH these sides had to battle hard last season to survive in the
first division and, even after only one game, it is hard not to forecast
more of the same.
A late penalty by Ken Eadie denied St Mirren victory, but even their
manager, Jimmy Bone, was able to comment wryly: ''We've lost our first
game for the last five seaons so I suppose I should be pleased with one
point, but really it should have been three.''
Defences dominated the first half, although whether Saints' opener was
a good or bad goal depended as usual in which dugout you were sitting.
Certainly Norrie McWhirter's speculative through ball should have been
cleared, but Scott Murdoch and keeper Gary Matthews both hesitated,
allowing Jamie Fullarton to nip in and lift the ball over the keeper
from 18 yards.
McWhirter, Fullarton, and Murdoch all were cautioned, which was a
pointer to the niggling which developed in the second half which, to be
fair, was a vast improvement on the first.
Saints again started brightly with substitute Ricky Gillies, who had
come on for the limping Barry Lavety on the half-hour mark, swivelling
and hitting a shot which was held by Matthews. However, the home side at
last found some inspiration and a David Nicholls effort struck the
underside of the bar.
Clydebank's hopes seemed dashed when James Grady was ordered off for
an over-the-ball tackle on McWhirter who was carried off.
However, against the run of play, Bankies equalised when they were
awarded a penalty after substitute Stuart Taylor appeared to trip Gary
Bowman. Eadie made no mistake with the spot kick.
Clydebank's coach Brian Wright said afterwards: ''We were more
committed in the second half and had far more shots on target -- even
after Grady was sent off.''

Airdrie 0, Dunfermline 1
DUNFERMLINE manager Bert Paton and club captain Norrie McCathie have
thrown down a challenge to first division favourites Dundee United and
any other side with sights set on the one promotion spot to the premier
division this season.
Paton watched and McCathie starred in Dunfermline's victory over
Airdrie at Broadwood on Saturday, and, after narrowly missing out on
promotion over the last two seasons, both feel the Fifers have what it
takes to make the leap back to the big time -- despite the fact that
most people are tipping United to leave every other club in the division
trailing.
Said Paton: ''We're quite happy for everyone to tip Rangers reserves
from up the road to win the league. I think we are going to be really
strong this season, and feel we are ready for anybody.
''Our victory over Airdrie -- it's the first time we have beaten them
away from home since I became manager -- was fully deserved, and I'm
going to have a few sleepless nights when I have all my players fit
again. People such as Andy Smith, Craig Robertson, Hamish French, and
Kenny Ward were all unavailable for this one.''
Captain McCathie, who has been at East End Park for 15 seasons,
realises this may be his last chance to get back to the premier
division, but is not in the least worried about the men from Tannadice
being regarded as hot favourites.
''Everybody fancies Dundee United, but they will find it hard in this
division,'' he said. ''Dunfermline are a big club, too, and we should be
in the top league, but we have no divine right to be there. We all know
it is going to take a lot of hard work, but we have a big squad and the
type of players who are ready to work.''
Saturday's match was one of those affairs which reminded us of the end
of a long, hard season rather than the bouncy, fizzy stuff you expect at
the start of a new campaign.
Airdrie had the better of the first half, but, even with new striker
Peter Duffield in the line-up, they failed to cash in.
Dunfermline dominated the second period and probably deserved their
victory, which was achieved by a beautiful goal from big Gregg Shaw.
The former Falkirk striker started the move in 78 minutes with a neat
lay-off to Paul Smith and, when he took the return pass, he spotted
Stewart Petrie charging down the left.
Shaw sent a perfect pass to his colleague and he raced towards goal
where he met Petrie's cross to bullet a powerful header past John
Martin.
Airdrie were unlucky in the closing minutes when a Duffield shot came
back off a post, but they didn't do nearly enough, especially in the
second half, to give the Fifers any real problems.
Airdrie were also annoyed at the sending off of midfield player Kenny
Black after 68 minutes for a second yellow card offence. ''That changed
the course of the match,'' said Alex MacDonald. ''But I can tell you
that no club discipline will be taken against the player -- and I had
better shut up and leave it at that.''
The Airdrie manager was clearly making sure he did not fall foul of
the SFA, and I also felt that the sending off was a bit harsh, but
Dunfermline looked the hungrier and more positive side and have got
themselves off to a flier.
What puzzled Airdrie fans more than the sending off of Black was the
sight of striker Alan Lawrence sitting in the stand while the side
struggled up front. Lawrence, out of contract, refused to sign a monthly
deal on Friday and could not play, and there seems no sign of an early
solution.
He said: ''I felt I had to make a stand, and I'm making it now. I'm
not being greedy or asking anything excessive. I'm only asking for what
some of the lads are getting and a lot less than others are getting.
''I will stick this out for as long as I can, which means as long as I
can afford.''

LUCY ELLMAN finds that using her own life as a vital source of
material for her novels can have its drawbacks
MY FIRST novel, Sweet Desserts, was an experiment. I wasn't sure that
I could write a novel at all nor, after I had written it, whether it was
one. What I'd proved in the process was that I am incapable of telling a
story in a straightforward manner, have great difficulty thinking up
names for my characters, and I have to use my own life in my work.
It's not that I'm after catharsis -- writing books in order to save
money on shrink bills. It's not even that I deliberately want to hurt
and embarrass family and friends. I simply have nothing else to write
about. Everyone's an expert on their own life -- in fact this is the
only subject to which I have devoted myself with zeal. I've spent years
contempating my own navel and see no reason not to burden others with my
findings!
My life has become a tool of my trade, like actors use their bodies;
it's not just their body, it's a theatrical prop. I regard anything I
can remember as possible material -- what saves me from offending
everybody is that I remember very little. This isn't autobiography
therefore. Autobiography is a different kind of fiction, with a pedantic
attachment to so-called truth. It rarely works. What would you rather
read, the memoirs of an Army colonel or those of his dog? The latter is
the novelist's job.
Many people thought Sweet Desserts was all too truthful. In its
depiction of two sisters, both with eating ''disorders'', but one with a
stunning career and an array of supposedly delectable boyfriends, the
other still a student and soon to settle for a pathetic husband, it does
bear some relation to my life. I have a high-flying sister and have had
a pathetic husband (he had a rather pathetic wife too, I admit).
In the book, the sisters' father eventually dies. The book was in fact
written while my own father was dying. One correspondent even recognised
the disease from my description of it, despite my deliberate avoidance
of naming it. In a court of literary licence, I'd no doubt be accused of
writing autobiography.
But that wasn't the intention. I felt these family relationships were
archetypal, universal. I was not describing my sister as much as sisters
in general -- well, what I knew about sisters, which was inevitably
based on my own experience.
The main character, Suzy (the younger sister), is struggling to finish
a thesis on collage. I was writing a PhD on collage when I decided to
give it up to write a novel. The thesis poured into the novel anyway,
both in the collage structure of the book and the helpful index at the
back. One can use autobiography in roundabout ways that actually turn it
on its head.
It's quite an eye-opener to find out who you offend by writing about
them. I felt I'd expressed a great deal of love for my sister in the
book, but she was not pleased. Nor was my mother, whom I killed off in
the first few pages, replacing her with an evil stepmother loosely based
on a combination of an obnoxious family friend and my grandmother.
My mother also wanted to know the name of the Italian train conductor
with whom Suzy has oral sex on her way to Venice -- a question I was
unable to answer, having not had a chance to ask him. (NOTE: I lost my
virginity in a much more pleasant way than I describe in the book -- the
guy with the socks came later.)
My brother meanwhile was hurt not to have been mentioned at all -- I
omitted his whole existence. I'm very fond of my brother, but I was
writing about sisters, not brothers. He says he lives in fear that I
will some day write about him in a book which he has already entitled,
My Jerky Brother.
Another guy caught my reference to him as bisexual and wanted to have
a long talk about it. And another surprised me by being pleased I'd
included him, despite my depiction of him as an emotional blackmailer,
lousy in bed, and prone to flatulence. I also wrote about the mad
husband of an old friend of mine.
The book has a kind of improvisatory freedom about it. I wanted to
joke, I wanted to shock.
It's almost a decade since I started writing it. If all our molecules
change every seven years, I'm not the same person at all, but I
recognise in it the same preoccupations and methods I'm still using
today. My second novel, Varying Degrees of Hopelessness, had similar
vagaries of plot, and some autobiographical foundation, though the
central character, Isabel, a 31-year-old virgin obsessed with romance,
strayed somewhat from fact.
But people still thought it was me. One friend asked if I really do
feel that bad about my belly button. Actually, I've never had any great
qualms about my belly button, but Isabel has a weird one.
In my third novel, Man or Mango? (in progress) I'm having my usual
trouble naming everyone, except for one guy called Ed. And once again I
seem to be writing about an annoyingly passive woman suffering from
unrequited love.
My daughter has recently pointed out that all of my books have an
American hero, which I hadn't even noticed. It's sad. But everyone's
allowed their little obsessions.
Sweet Desserts, adapted from Lucy Ellman's novel, is on the Edinburgh
Festival Fringe at The Pleasance until September 2.

Ulster took a backward step at the weekend as the parade of Apprentice
Boys of Derry sparked off confrontation and violence reminiscent of 26
years ago.
PEACE, what peace? The question lay heavy on the minds of many people
in Ulster this weekend. Suddenly, amid all the optimism of a new
brighter future, the province took a nasty lurch towards its violent
past.
The scenes of street battles between Catholic crowds and the RUC
seemed a rerun of August 12, 1969, when days and nights of rioting led
to the emergency deployment of troops for the first time. Then, as now,
the spark for violence had been lit by the traditional parade of
Protestant Apprentice Boys of Derry.
On Saturday, as the organisation insisted on marching around the
ancient walls of the city, overlooking the large Catholic neighbourhoods
of the Bogside and Creggan housing estates, it seemed as if history was
being rerun.
The trouble that occurred was predictable. Just as in 1969, the
Apprentice Boys were not going to step back from their age-old custom of
celebrating the Siege of Derry in 1689, when the Protestant King William
of Orange sailed up the River Foyle and chased away the army of the
Catholic King James, which had surrounded the city.
And just as in 1969, the arrival of 15,000 Protestants on Saturday was
not welcomed by the city's modern Catholic and nationalist majority, who
viewed the Apprentice Boys' parade as provocative, out-dated
triumphalism.
Throughout last week, the omens were not good. The Catholic mayor of
Derry, John Kerr, a member of the Social Democratic Labour Party,
appealed for an end to such marches and a new united approach to marking
his city's history. But the right to march and where to march have
become issues of major import in both communities. If the peace process
means anything, say Catholic, nationalist voices, then it must bring an
end to sectarian demonstrations at least in areas of Ulster where
Protestants are in the minority, such as Derry and parts of Belfast.
Yet, after 25 years during which they feel their former dominance has
been whittled away, Protestant Unionists are in no mood to give way on
what they believe is a vital civil right.
Throughout the summer, and despite the IRA and Loyalist ceasefires,
the tension over parades has built up, and as with last weekend and the
July 12 parades, boiled over into confrontation and trouble. At the
heart of the matter, is the phrase ''parity of esteem'' which is part of
the language of the peace declaration agreed between the British and
Irish governments.
To Catholics, it should mean an end to Protestant parades in or near
their neighbourhoods. To Protestants, it should mean Catholics showing a
new tolerance for all their marches. In practice, it has led to a
nightmare for the RUC, whose senior officers must take the final
decision whether to allow a march to go ahead or not.
Northern Ireland has thousands of parades every year, the majority
concentrated in July and August. In the past, Government orders have
been made banning gatherings or marches over a specific period or in a
certain area. More recently, the policy of the authorities has been to
avoid outright bans and allow the police on the ground to made judgments
on each gathering as to whether it is likely to lead to a breach of the
peace.
To date, the strategy has succeeded on many more occasions than it has
failed. Police usually take no decisions until the eleventh hour, which
gives them time to assess the strength of any opposition to a parade,
the will of those who are insisting on marching, and to try to negotiate
a compromise route. All this was done last week but to no avail, and the
police decided to let the marches go ahead.
The right to march along south Belfast's Ormeau Road has become a
cause celebre for Protestants even though 25 years of violence has
brought major demographic changes there, as in Derry.
The lower end of the Ormeau Road, a major access to the centre of
Belfast, is now flanked by streets of working-class Catholics, who want
all Protestant marches to be rerouted away from the area.
In Derry, Protestants are in a minority and though the old walled
central precincts are perceived as neutral, they stand on the side of
the River Foyle occupied overwhelmingly by Catholics.
RUC senior officers have defended their decisions to allow parades in
both cities on Saturday and rejected claims of heavy-handed police
tactics in south Belfast. But the scenes of riot police baton-charging
Catholics and firing plastic bullets is a blow to the force's attempts
to develop a better relationship with that community and to attract more
recruits from within it.
So far this year only one parade has been allowed to go through the
Catholic Ormeau neighbourhood. What is now in question in the minds of
Catholic leaders is the judgment of the RUC in accepting that a tiny
march of only 20 or so Apprentice Boys with their band, should be
allowed through, with such violent consequences.
Furthermore, the clashes in Belfast between Catholics and police
undoubtedly fuelled tempers elsewhere across Ulster.
In Derry, the RUC argue that had they not allowed a section of the
15,000 Apprentice Boys gathering to march around the walls (ironically
opened for the first time since 1969 because of Ulster's new-found
peace) the trouble would have been worse. Senior officers are worried
that if Protestants decide to force the right to march in a certain
area, the security forces may not be able to contain them. This happened
during July at Portadown and at the Ormeau Road, when the situations
were so serious that troops were called up on stand-by.
The RUC also believe that Sinn Fein and the IRA are acting as agent
provocateurs, organising and stirring up protests, with the aim of
embarrassing the police. Certainly Sinn Fein activists were to the fore
at the weekend. Their graffiti and posters attack the RUC's image. One
poster shows an RUC officer with an Orange Order collarette draped over
his shoulders.
The Sinn Fein leader, Martin McGuinness, was at the centre of the
Derry protest and described the actions of the police in removing him
and others staging a sit-down on the city's walls, as a ''defeat for the
RUC''.
More alarmingly, the viciousness of the clashes in Belfast and Derry,
the use of petrol bombs and the appearance of men wearing masks,
strongly suggest an IRA dimension to the trouble.
Many people believe the RUC is in a no-win position with regard to
marches. On the evidence of the weekend, the RUC has won some approval
from Protestants, but has lost ground in the propaganda war for the
hearts and minds of Catholics.

BRITAIN'S largest manufacturing union may have taken a swing to the
left in the contest for its leadership.
Voting for the vacant presidency of the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union has ended and, although the result is not due to be
announced until September, the union's dominant right wing fears that
the sole left-wing candidate has topped the poll.
However, Tyneside district secretary Mr Davey Hall, 43, is not a
typical left-winger in that he supports Labour leader Mr Tony Blair's
programme to modernise the party.
He also received lavish praise from the late Confederation of
Shipbuilding and Engineering Union general secretary Mr Alec Ferry,
himself a staunch moderate, for being the ''most effective'' union
official during the key shorter working week dispute of five years ago.
If he has topped the poll, it will be partly because of the lack of
discipline within the right-wing camp which split its votes between
three candidates.
It remains to be seen whether the ''official'' right wing candidate,
Mr Jackie Crystal, the executive member from Tyneside, has pipped his
decidely more able Midlands counterpart, Mr John Allen, to contest the
second ballot run-off against Mr Hall.
A third right-wing candidate, one M Meecham from Bristol, is clearly
set to be eliminated.
An all-Tyneside run-off between Mr Hall and Mr Crystal would be
intriguing and could open the way for the AEEU to have its first
left-wing president since Hugh (now Lord) Scanlon retired in 1978.
But as Gavin (now Sir Gavin) Laird proved in 1981 when he came from
behind to wrest the AEU general secretaryship from Communist Mr Ken
Brett, who had topped the first poll, it is the second ballot that
really matters.
The AEEU presidency became vacant earlier this year when Mr Bill
Jordan became the first British general secretary of the Brussels-based
International Confederation of Free Trades Unions. Under the terms of
the amalgamation between the AEU and the EETPU electricians, it is being
decided, for the last time, solely by members of the union's engineering
section, the old AEU.
The electrical section, the former EETPU, will decide who should
replace Mr Paul Gallagher, who has just retired on health grounds from
the post of AEEU general secretary. Both posts will be open to a full
ballot of the combined AEEU membership when they are next up for
re-election in five years.
Sir Gavin Laird retired from the AEEU in June.

A COUPLE and their 26 pet dogs are facing eviction for the third time
in four years.
The pack of pedigree Irish setters and their owners, Pat and Brian
Reader, have been told by Moray District Councilit is time to go
''walkies'' from their Banffshire caravan home, despite pleas they have
nowhere else to go.
''We are absolutely fed up with this now. It has been going on for
years,'' said Mrs Reader, 52. ''Why can't everybody just leave us in
peace?''
The Readers have devoted their lives to their animals and at one time
had no fewer than 72 dogs.
Management consultant Mr John Birch and his wife, Margaret, came to
their rescue two years ago when they became homeless for the second
time.
The Birches offered them a site for their caravan in a field behind
their house at Letterfourie, near Buckie.
Mr Birch said the Readers were model tenants, adding: ''They are not
doing anybody any harm and we would be delighted to let them carry on
living there.''
The Birches are so angry about their tenants' plight they have started
up a petition to change the council's mind.
The Readers had to give away most of their pets in 1991 when the
landlord of a cottage they rented near Deskford, Banffshire, refused to
renew the lease.
Two years later, they were living in a caravan near derelict farm
buildings beside the runway at RAF Lossiemouth but had to leave when the
site was sold. Now council planners say new rules introduced in Moray in
1993 ban anyone wanting to use a caravan as a permanent home.
Planning officials visited the Letterfourie site after objections from
neighbours and gave the Readers six months to quit.
''This may just look like an old caravan in a field to you, but we
thought we had found our little bit of paradise,'' said former nurse Mrs
Reader, who receives an invalidity pension.
''The dogs are well looked after. We've had visits from the SSPCA and
environmental health officers, who have given the place a clean bill of
health. Where are we meant to go now?'' The council advised the couple
to apply for a council house or look for a private flat.
Mr Reader, 63, a former fitter who spends #80 a week on dog food, said
it was unlikely the council or a private landlord would agree to house
their pets. ''These are more than just pet dogs in our eyes -- they are
our family. We couldn't leave them.''
Mr Stewart Halkett, Moray's deputy director of planning, said the
council was simply sticking to the rules.

A MASSIVE explosion, which blew a man out of his seventeenth-floor
council flat window, appears to have been caused by a suicide attempt, a
fire officer said yesterday.
The 20-year-old man died after falling 200ft from the nineteen-storey
block in Birmingham. His body was found on Saturday night at the foot of
Wilmcote Tower, Highgate.
Paramedics, police, and council workmen were called to the tower
block, owned by Birmingham City Council, after complaints from residents
that water was flooding through their ceilings.
The explosion happened as carpenters tried to break down the man's
door, which had been barricaded. The officials saw a huge fireball blow
the man out of the window.
Police have yet to name the man, who had a history of depressive
illness.
Seven other people were injured in the explosion, which fire chiefs
said was caused when the main gas supply pipe inside the flat was
severed.
''The occupant had severed the gas supply pipe and there was a free
flow of gas which appears to have been ignited by a small fire which the
occupant had lit in the flat itself,'' said West Midlands Divisional
Fire Officer Bill Gough.
It appeared to have been a suicide attempt, he said, adding: ''It
seems he certainly wasn't thinking in a very level-headed way.''

<TEXT>
I WRITE not only as president of the Scottish Rhododendron Society but
also as a member of the Arduaine Gardens Advisory Committee, a member of
the National Trust for Scotland, and a long-time friend of Ed and Harry
Wright.
I have been embroiled on the periphery of the dispute about Arduaine
gardens for some considerable time, trying in many respects to act as a
broker between Ed and the NTS.
As in most disputes there is truth on both sides, although I am not
sure that either side fully recognises the position of the other.
When Ed and Harry realised that they were not going to be able to
maintain their magnificent garden they explored a number of avenues in
an attempt to ensure the long-term viability of this unique collection
of plants. Having failed to secure a suitable financially viable
package, they eventually reached an agreement with the NTS, which on
face value should have meant a trouble-free and permanent continuity for
this world-famous garden.
Unfortunately it is true that if something can go wrong it will go
wrong and this has happened at Arduaine.
The NTS, like any large national organisation, has its problems such
as communications and misunderstandings and here it underestimated the
feelings that the loss of direct responsibility might cause.
Ed and Harry worked for so many years to achieve perfection (and Ed is
a perfectionist bar none) that the garden, as it is now, became their
creation, the loss of which was difficult to come to terms with.
There have been some problems on both sides, caused initially by
communications between the NTS and Ed and Harry, although I do not
believe that there was any deliberate plot to deceive them.
The trust has, however, accepted that there have been some
deficiencies and to be fair has moved some way towards rectifying them.
Ed on the other hand has been reluctant to make any conciliatory moves
until he had received a full apology from the trust and the
implementation of the necessary changes that he had sought.
The idea of a management committee was initially Ed's idea which was I
believe fully supported by all members of the advisory committee.
Unfortunately a recent meeting (at which I was not present) appeared to
result in an entrenchment of positions on both sides and the subsequent
abandonment of the idea of a management committee by the trust, since Ed
apparently was still refusing to accept the position of the present head
gardener.
In a very recent letter to the trust, Ed has made quite considerable
moves towards the inevitability that the trust does have the
responsibility for the head gardener and his staff and has said that
with a minor modification he will accept the terms of reference for the
management committee as drafted by the trust.
I therefore hope that the NTS will, despite the previous problem, now
accept his offer and that the War in the West will reach a peaceful
solution.

FIRE chiefs have issued a warning after a child was badly burned at a
barbecue.
Eighteen-month-old Bradley Kirkwood is believed to have been injured
by a fire flash when flammable spirit was poured on the lit barbecue.
His great aunt and grandfather were also injured in the incident in
Elgin, Moray, at the weekend.
Divisional Officer Mike Morrice, of Grampian Fire Brigade, warned
against the use of anything other than approved barbecue lighting fuel.
''Never use petrol or other highly flammable liquids and never try to
add fuel once the barbecue is lit,'' he said.
Bradley, who is understood to have burns to a third of his body, was
last night described as stable in hospital in Aberdeen.
The condition of his great-aunt, Mrs Agnes Reid, 76, of Turner Street,
Buckie, was said to be serious.
They accident happened in the garden of Bradley's grandparents' home
in Young Street, Elgin.
His grandfather, Mr William Smith, 56, a printer, was treated for arm
and chest burns at the Dr Gray's Hospital, Elgin, but released later.
Bradley and Mrs Reid were transferred to hospitals in Aberdeen. The
ambulance which took the boy to the Royal Aberdeen Sick Children's
Hospital was given a police escort.
Bradley's parents, Brian, an engineer, and Lorraine, of Maisondieu
Road, Elgin, have an older son, Andrew, aged five. Mr Kirkwood was
believed to be at his son's bedside last night.
Police said they were making inquiries into the cause of the accident.

IT IS a great pity that the fiftieth anniversary of VJ-Day has been
turned into a sterile argument about the rights and wrongs of the
nations and people involved. Hindsight is again being used, rather
dogmatically by some groups and pundits: for example, to justify or
condemn the dropping of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Surely the occasion must primarily be a time for sad reflection and
respect for the memory of all those who died or suffered as a result of
the war in the Far East.
The personal apology from the Japanese Prime Minister, in a letter to
our own Prime Minister, should be accepted, at least, as an honest token
of contrition. The fact that it falls short of what might satisfy
ex-servicemen's and prisoners-of-war organisations, is understandable.
The question of compensation, however, seems to me to be one which
could involve many intractable problems in formulating a scheme whereby
those most in need could qualify, irrespective of whether the funds came
from Japan or elsewhere.
I happen to have a personal interest as my late brother was a
prisoner-of-war having been captured, along with thousands of others not
only from the United Kingdom but from Australia, India and other parts
of the then Empire, at the fall of Singapore in February 1942.
He was fortunate to survive working on the infamous Burma/Siam railway
and finished up in a POW camp in Saigon, French Indo-China.
I happened to have served with the forgotten 14th Army in Burma and
had the good fortune to meet up with my brother in Rangoon after the
Japanese surrender.
Rangoon became the gathering place for many of the allied
prisoners-of-war and I shall never forget the appalling physical
condition they were in. They were nevertheless full of joy and relieved
that the war was over and that they would soon be home again and
re-united with their families and loved ones.
I mention all this to enable me to express a point of view on the
question of the demand for compensation, which is that it should be our
own Government which, if the need for compensation is justified, should
bear the responsibility.
Most former Far East POWs I ever knew thought it was regrettable that
our governments and parliaments in the immediate post-war era had not
been more generous in their treatment of those who suffered at the hands
of the Japanese.
Even now, I think our own Government has the obligation to look after
those survivors and perhaps dependants of ex-servicemen and women or
civilian internees, who still suffer illness or hardship as a result of
the war in the Far East.
If there is a problem that can be alleviated by some compensatory
financial or other support, then our own Government should deal with it
and not pass the buck to the Japanese people.

ANN COLTART visits Glasgow Women's Library's new Trongate home where
ambitious projects are being planned
AT LAST, founder-workers of the Glasgow Women's Library can afford to
pay someone modest wages, for the next few months anyway. They have been
running a unique resource in Scotland for almost four years, established
a reputation beyond the Border, and become an important focal point in
female networking -- but they've done it all on guts, gifts, and
peanuts.
The library has settled in on two floors above Trongate, on the edge
of the Merchant City and linking with the arts enclave developing behind
in the King Street area.
Rapidly growing in membership and materials, the library literally
burst out of its original corner shop site in Garnethill, just behind
Glasgow School of Art. It opened there late in 1991 and became so
popular that larger premises had to be found.
Glasgow District Council offered them their present home at a
reasonable rent and they have just been given a grant of #10,000 from a
publicity-shy business organisation. With this the library has bought a
handsome Dowling stove for the winter and will pay a meagre amount for a
lot of labour -- until the money runs out.
The library sprang from the organisation Women in Profile (WIP), set
up before Glasgow was the European City of Culture, to emphasise women's
contributions to culture and art.
Adele Patrick, Kate Henderson, and Sue John -- with the backing of
many other women -- have kept the WIP ideal going since and the library
is the most solid manifestation of this.
There are friendly welcomes for women using the place and workers make
endless covers, in between the endless filing, cross referencing, phone
answering, guiding new members, following up queries, and trying to
remember to water the plants.
''We may be poor and overstretched as usual, but this is a lovely
place to work'' says Sue.
Female volunteers made it so. Light from the large windows reflects
from white walls and gleaming floors which they sanded and varnished.
Donated shelves and cabinets, laden with books, archives and clearly
marked information surround a broad table area where people can write
and read in peace.
Our cuttings service helps to raise income, says Kate. ''For example
the district council's women's unit pays about #15 a month for items we
find for them, and there are regular requests from health organisations,
students, TV, radio, and many one-off requests,'' she explains.
The library has about 30 free subscriptions to UK newspapers and
magazines, though the Scotsman oddly has turned them down.
Although women can use facilities free, if they're members they can
take material away, receive mailings, and get discounts on events and
sales. Annual membership fees are #20 for groups, #15 for waged women
and #7.50 for those on low pay or who are unwaged.
Men sometimes ask for information but their visits are made by
appointment as the library is offered as a service and space essentially
for women.
A cafe and sales counter was planned but there is no space at present,
though it is hoped another floor may become available from the city
council.
The top storey is used for storage and has just received a load of
hundreds of boxes of fascinating items from London.
''We were asked to give a home to the National Lesbian Archives and
it's now arrived,'' says Adele. ''This collection lost its space in
London and finding new premises there was too expensive, so we were
delighted to have it come here. One proviso for this archive being
lodged in Glasgow was that it be kept intact. Additions will be made to
it, however.''
The library now has more than 400 members and many drop-in visitors
and connections with sister projects and information sources around the
world.
''We rely on those memberships to keep going, along with the cuttings
service,'' says Kate. ''And we are still thinking up new ideas for
fundraising events and sponsorship drives.''
The library has three word processors, two of which were donated via
the Glasgow women's unit and the city council has also installed a new
lift from their alley entrance off Trongate.
Sue displayed some of the publicity material being prepared with a
grant from the Equal Opportunities Commission.
There are posters advertising the cuttings service and bookmarks
explaining membership incorporating the library's simple but distinctive
logo in the design.
''We've included messages in Urdu, Punjabi and Chinese and are hoping
we'll get materials in other languages so that more women can use the
library,'' Sue explains.
This is not a highbrow haven. Any newcomer of any age can find novels,
biographies, trade union materials, documentation on a host of subjects
from health to humour, violence to music, with videos, slides,
photcopying facilities, up-to-date information on events and
organisations and a few tranquil corners.
''What we want to see in the future is some collecting of oral
history,'' says Adele. ''And we'd like to be able to give bursaries to
people to do research and gather material.''
Kate says that they were also hoping to provide lectures, poetry
readings, popular culture events and courses, and they do have a
sign-language course planned for the autumn.
''Not forgetting trying to get funds for an electronic database, a
phone system for deaf people and of course making our lavvy more
accessible,'' adds Sue.
With its progress so far, Glasgow Women's Library will probably
achieve all this and more.
Glasgow Women's Library, 109 Trongate, G1 5HD. Access by stairs and
lift from side entrance. Telephone 0141 552 8345. Open Tuesday to Friday
1-6pm, Saturday 2-5pm.

AN ARMY of ''Redcoats'' patrolling streets in the centre of Glasgow is
proving a big hit with visitors arriving in the city.
As the first project of its kind in Britain, City Centre
Representatives was launched to help tourists get the most out of their
visit.
The 15 ''ambassadors'' walk the city centre in distinctive red
uniforms, giving advice and pointing visitors towards attractions such
as the Burrell Collection and the People's Palace.
''As soon as we see anyone looking at a map, taking photographs or
looking lost, we go up to them and ask if they need any help,'' said Mr
David McKee, CCR's project manager.
Since last month's launch of the year-long pilot project, the reps
have been patrolling an area from Hope Street to High Street from west
to east and George Square to Argyle Street from north to south.
Radios keep them in touch with the scheme's offices in the High Street
and allow them to raise the alarm if they see any trouble or to get
additional information for tourists.
CCR's complement of 15 reps, six clean-up squad members and three
administrative staff was drawn from the ranks of the long-term
unemployed, with funding from the Glasgow Development Agency and Glasgow
City Council.
They underwent a six-week training programme, including a series of
courses from the tourist board which included learning basic phrases in
five foreign languages.
Mr McKee said: ''We've had visitors from Canada and America say they
think it's a fabulous scheme. And some Australians were so impressed
they are trying to get it introduced in some of their cities.''

I WANT to debunk the myth that Japanese atrocities to their prisoners
were inspired by the belief that prisoners were sub-human having
forfeited their honour by not taking their own lives when they were
taken prisoner.
When the tables were turned and thousands of Japanese prisoners were
in ''the bag'' there was no great bloodbath as they chose death to
dishonour. Indeed it never entered their heads.
From the officer class down through the most barbaric guards there was
a concerted rush to grovel to their victims pleading to have
testimonials signed, witnessing to their humanity and kindness.
After three-and-a-half years of their cruelty I find no fanciful
mitigation for the behaviour of the Japanese and Korean guards. It was
they who were sub-human.

THE Japanese Government insisted last night its Prime Minister, Mr
Tomiichi Murayama, did apologise to Britain for atrocities committed
during the Second World War after Mr Murayama apparently reneged on his
apology at the weekend.
As a week of VJ Day commemorations marking the end of the war in the
Far East got under way across the country yesterday, a statement issued
by the Japanese Embassy in London emphasised that Mr Murayama had been
sincere in a letter sent to Mr Major in July.
In a move meant to clarify what has been damaging confusion over the
exact meaning of the Prime Minister's words, the embassy said Mr
Murayama had recalled in his letter sentiments of remorse that the
Japanese Government had conveyed to Mr Major in a summit meeting in
Japan in 1993.
However, Japan's apology was dismissed by Far East war veterans who
had travelled from around Scotland to attend the Burma Star
Association's VJ Day 50th anniversary commemoration service in Airdrie
yesterday afternoon. One described it as a joke.
The row broke on Saturday, when Mr Murayama reportedly told a Japanese
news agency that the main purpose of the letter was to congratulate Mr
Major on winning the Conservative Party leadership election and that it
was not a letter of apology.
The remark had outraged former prisoners of war and war veterans'
associations who have demanded a full apology from Japan. Around 73,000
Far East Allied war veterans are suing the Japanese Government for
#14,000 each in compensation.
However, the Japanese embassy said Mr Murayama's comments on Saturday
did not contradict the remorse over Japan's actions expressed in his
earlier letter. ''There is no change on the part of the Prime Minister
Murayama and the Japanese Government regarding that view.''
It is now expected that Mr Murayama will mark the 50th anniversary of
the official surrender of Japan tomorrow to apologise formally to the
world for the massacres and degredation inflicted on prisoners.
Officials also said the letter sent from one Prime Minister to another
was not simply a personal matter. ''The feelings expressed there were on
behalf of the Japanese people.''
It was met with cynicism by the veterans at Airdrie. Accompanied by
wives and family some 400 veterans, many decorated with a row of medals,
recalled painful memories of service in Burma and of lost friends at the
association's last Scotland-wide reunion in the town's West Parish
Church. In future commemoration services will be held locally as time
and age take their toll on branch membership numbers.
In an emotional sermon, the former Moderator of the General Assembly
of the Church of Scotland, the Very Rev Dr Hugh Wyllie, said 50 years on
there was still a lot of confusion about the necessity of many events of
the war and in Japan a lot of ignorance of the atrocities the country
had committed.
He said while a lot had been written in recent weeks blaming the
Americans for dropping the second atomic bomb on Japan, people read
little in the British press about the rape of Nanking, the horrific
medical experiments carried out by the Japanese, and about the misery
suffered in the prisoner of war camps.
''There is a lot of confusion and it has to be clarified. You are the
people to do that. I'm sure there is no confusion in your memories of
those long years seperated from families and home,'' he said.
As they gathered to lay wreaths on the town's war memorial, many
described Japan's apology as at best half-hearted, at worst utter
nonsense. Mr Doug Laing from Aberdeen recalled time spent at the RAF's
forward repair depot in Bishnapur. ''I don't think much of the apology.
Our sympathies go to the prisoners of war who need a proper apology from
the nation of Japan and financial help.''
Mr Lewis Brown, 74, from Stirling, served with the Royal Corps of
Signallers in Burma. In a voice full of anger he said Japan's apology
was a joke. ''People never saw how the Japanses acted. They don't know
what we saw.''
More than 500 veterans also gathered in Glasgow's George Square after
a commemoration service in the city's St Andrews Cathedral. To mark the
occasion, Scottish artist George Wyllie unveiled a sculpture of
grave-like slabs beside the cenotaph.
Around 25,0000 veterans are expected to take part in a week of
commemorative VJ Day events including a service of rememberance outside
Buckingham Palace and Beating the Retreat ceremonies in London,
Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Glasgow.

WHILE we all share Bill Speirs's humanitarian concern for those
suffering in the former Yugoslavia, and admire his determination and
personal courage in actually going there in an attempt to help, I was
nevertheless surprised at the lack of any strategic overview in his
letter or any attempt to respond to my core argument that British
removal from permanent membership of the Security Council is a
prerequisite for lasting peace (August 11).
Ethnic cleansing is a systematic and crafted attempt to eliminate an
entire people and derives from the same philosophical thought processes
as the final solution of Adolf Hitler.
As the aerial photographs over Srebrenica seem to indicate, and as the
mass grave found near Vukovar in 1993 does in fact indicate, these
massacres were ordered at the highest military and political level.
An abomination and offence against humanity as the attacks against
fleeing Krajina refugees are, they are not ethnic cleansing, and indeed
Croatian Ministers are already making it clear that they will actively
co-operate in the repatriation of all but war criminals.

ALAN Clayton states that the Croatian offensive in the Krajina was not
to ethnically cleanse the area but to ''liberate the population of the
Krajina from the black marketeers, drug dealers, and currency fraudsters
who had taken political control of the area'' (August 9).
How then does he explain the harrowing scenes we see each evening? Are
the thousands of men, women and children, apparently heading for Serbian
territory the mentioned liberated population, or are they the black
marketeers, drug dealers, and currency fraudsters?
Finally, perhaps the next time Alan Clayton has #10 to gamble with he
may find the National Lottery or a flutter on the horses a bit more
tasteful to bet on rather than the reactions of Governments to the
unfolding horrors of the former Yugoslavia.

JOHN MACLEOD'S article (SNP aim should be to destroy Labour, August 8)
proves the point that pontification is the stuff of the columnist. It's
of no great consequence whether it's based on knowledge or insight
provided it reads well.
As a card-carrying member of the righteous as well as the SNP, John
Macleod should go back to the basics of Scottish Nationalism. The core
of our creed is not how do we achieve independence but why do we want
independence.
Some want independence for its own sake, a long held but totally
irrelevant view in a modern democratic society.
The SNP wants it to protect and positively develop the social and
economic life of our country.
These aims will be met, as they are met in many other small Western
European countries, by policies based upon socialist principles --
security of employment, welfare, and other related rights.
These are principles which command broad support in Scottish society
and are underpinned in Scotland, though not in England, by an acceptance
of the need to bite the redistributive bullet.

SCOTLAND's Colin Montgomerie yesterday lost the fifth play-off of his
career in as many of these fraught confrontations when at the first hole
of sudden death for the US PGA championship at the Riviera Country Club,
Steve Elkington of Australia holed a 20-foot putt for a birdie 3 to
which the Scot's reply from 15 feet, slightly pushed, missed by the
narrowest of margins.
Montgomerie's fate was all the more agonising for him since have
lamented long and bitterly over his fragile putting stroke he had
suddenly rediscovered his touch. Apparently out of contention at 14
under par, Europe's first ranked golfer of the last two years birdied
the final three holes of regulation play from four feet, five feet and
18 feet.
That last putt for a score of 65 tied him with his equally powerful
rival, at 32 the same age as himself, on a 17-under-par total of 267
which equalled the record aggregate for any of the four majors set by
Greg Norman in the 1992 Open Championship at Royal St George's.
Montgomerie took his disappointment stoically. ''I made par at the
play-off hole, so he won, I didn't lose,'' he said. ''I needed 64 or 65
to win and I made the start I wanted and kept that going. Knowing that I
had to birdie the last three holes to tie, and doing just that, lets me
take something positive away with me.
''I'm playing the best golf of my life from tee to green and although
my putting was not outstanding I took three putts only once.'' Then,
with a wry smile, Montgomerie added: ''The greens were as good today as
they have been all week.'' But for the Glasgow-born golfer, second for
the fourth time this season to earn #134,873, once again it was not to
be.
Elkington, a former winner of the Players' Championship and twice of
the tournament specifically for US Tour winners, had slightly more
ground to make up at the start of his round on yet another hot Los
Angeles afternoon -- six strokes adrift of the overnight leader, Ernie
Els, as against five for Montgomerie.
But as Els, apparently in unstoppable form, began to show signs that
he was vulnerable after all, Montgomerie, who was also runner-up in
Sweden last week and has not won since the German Open 12 months ago,
and Elkington, who was fifth in the Masters and sixth in the Open last
month, began to gather some momentum.
Elkington, eventually to earn #224,789, was the first to nail his
colours to the mast. He went to the turn in 31, four under par, and then
really trod on the accelerator with three successive birdies from the
turn, none with putts longer than 10 feet. He had a serious struggle to
save par at the long seventeenth and made a solid 4 at the last.
Montgomerie, too, was out of his blocks quickly with two opening
birdies. He turned in 32, but when he bogeyed the fourteenth to be
relatively three behind Elkington it looked as if he was to be thwarted
again of a major title as he had been in the 1992 and 1994 US Opens, in
the latter of which he also lost in a play-off.
With remarkable foresight, Montgomerie had suggested that the soft and
spiky greens on the 6949-yard course might help putters of the modest
reputation possessed both by himself and Elkington. He was proved only
too right; unfortunately it was the Australian who extended his own
play-off record to three wins out of five.
The irony for Els was that he could not rescue a faltering game at the
two long holes on the inward half which remained to him, for in the
first three rounds he was cumulatively 11 under for the three, having
scored nothing worse than a birdie. But just when he needed these most
he drove into rough at the eleventh and again at the seventeenth, where
he also missed from four feet to save par.
Although Els shared third place with Jeff Maggert, who thereby made
the US Ryder Cup side, the next best performance of the day was surely
given by Brad Faxon, the 34-year-old professional from Rhode Island, who
was out in 28, seven under, and round in 63, both figures equalling the
record in any of the four major championships.
That round, which also earned Faxon an eleventh hour place on the US
team, began two hours ahead of the last group, he was 11 strokes behind
Els and 20 players were in front of him. His outward half equalled Denis
Durnian's in the 1983 Open at Royal Birkdale and with his score he
joined 16 other players.
Sandy Lyle (71) finished disappointingly on 280, and Sam Torrance (71
for 278) could not quite fulfil his ambition of beating 70 in all four
rounds.

Jerusalem
JEWISH settlers shot dead an Arab today after about 100 Palestinians
demolished their makeshift hilltop camp set up to thwart Palestinian
self-rule, witnesses said.
The violence highlighted obstacles facing Israeli and PLO neogitators
trying to flesh out a framework agreement on extending Palestinian
self-rule to the West Bank in time for a September 6 Washington signing.
Witnesses said about 100 Palestinians from Dura al-Qara village north
of Jerusalem knocked down a partially-built cinderblock house and set
fire to the camp and an Israeli flag.
The camp was erected as part of a four-week-old campaign to block the
extension of autonomy from Gaza to the West Bank and an Israeli army
redployment.
The only settlers at the site, a woman and four children, fled. Others
soon arrived and opened fire, killing Khairy Mohammed Abdel-Hafeez and
wounding another Arab, witnesses and hospital sources said. Settlers
denied killing anyone. The army said it was investigating.
Soldiers prevented Palestinians from marching on another
settler-occupied hilltop in a nearby village. Settlers later heeded an
army request to leave the hill.
The self-rule Palestinian Authority issued a statement urging Israel
to rein in the settlers, saying the shooting endangered the whole peace
process.
The violence coincided with efforts by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat to win backing for the outline
self-rule deal reached after marathon talks on Friday.
Rabin's 18-strong cabinet on Sunday approved the deal which Interior
Minister Ehud Barak, a former army chief, said could weaken Israel's
bargaining position in talks next year on the final status of the West
Bank and Gaza.
Right-wing Energy Minister Gonen Segev voted against the deal while
Barak and one other minister abstained, cabinet sources said. Segev
cited security fears and the fate of settlements near the 1967 border.
Arafat was scheduled to fly to Tunis to try to persuade a meeting on
Monday of the PLO's Executive Committee to back the accord. Senior
Israeli and Palestinian sources said they expected both leaders would
push through the deal, a key component of the 1993 Israeli-PLO peace
accord which is already one year behind schedule.
The United States has already issued invitations for the signing and
is pressing both sides to conclude the agreement, the sources
said.--Reuter

AS an SNP activist I find that my recollections of the party's
campaign during the 1992 General Election differ considerably from those
of the party leader Alex Salmond and your columnist John Macleod.
I live in North East Fife and, while this area may not be a stronghold
of the SNP, I vividly recall many new and young recruits coming to the
SNP in response to the party's message. This mirrored what took place in
many of the constituencies throughout Scotland and at the end of that
election the SNP share of the vote advanced from 14% in 1987 to almost
22%.
If, as John Macleod stated (August 8), the 1992 campaign was a
''shambles'' then it was a rather curious ''shambles'' which produced a
50% hike in performance from the previous General Election. If another
''shambles'' is produced in 1996 or 1997 which results in a similar rise
in support then many of us on the ''Sillars'' wing of the party will be
quite content.
Turning to Mr Salmond's assessment of why the SNP did not make the
breakthrough in 1992, his point about resources may be valid. It is
equally valid to note, however, that one week prior to the election
taking place the party stood at over 30% in the opinion polls and looked
poised to make considerable advances.
There is no escaping the fact that it was the very positive nature of
the Independence campaign which took it to this point.
Further credence is given to this belief when one examines the party's
Independence in Europe campaign during the 1994 European elections. The
SNP scored over 30% in the polls and gained the North East of Scotland
seat in the process. History shows clearly that the SNP campaigning on
an independence ticket is a party with a strong message capable of
galvanising support.
Finally, it seems that John Macleod has now twigged the nature of Mr
Salmond's ''slowly, slowly catchee monkey'' strategy and clearly he
approves. Perhaps, however, he should be asking that if this strategy is
so successful then why is the SNP only standing at 22% of the polls and
the same level that the ''shambles'' of 1992 achieved?

THERE cannot be much sense in having an airport at Abbotsinch,
Renfrewshire, when Glasgow businessmen have to travel to Edinburgh to
catch an aircraft for London.
It is claimed that all this trouble is due to the crammed traffic
conditions on the Kingston Bridge and the M8 motorway. The latest report
states that work on the Kingston Bridge will start in January, 1996. Why
not close the bridge now and start the big repair job?
Prestwick, however, has a new railway which takes passengers right
into the airport. The new authority running Prestwick Airport is
arranging flights to London (Luton). Glasgow businessmen will be able to
catch a train from Glasgow Central to Prestwick and this will take less
time than travelling in their cars to Turnhouse.
Glasgow Airport is becoming a backwater as instanced by the withdrawal
of three American airlines in the winter and its poor fuelling
arrangements.
Prestwick, like Heathrow and Gatwick, has the hydrant system. Large
aircraft can leave Prestwick with a full load of fuel and passengers.

Lesley Duncan meets Rosamunde Pilcher whose first book in five years
will be published this month
SAYS Rosamunde Pilcher: ''Sex and money are just lovely things but the
minute you start to talk about them they both become incredibly dull.''
The best-selling author of The Shell Seekers, September, and a new novel
of door-stopper dimensions, Coming Home, is herself at home (and
obviously at home with herself) as she makes the pronouncement.
Her books have sold in millions throughout the world and have been
translated into some 25 languages (26 indeed, for an Indonesian version
of the Shell Seekers recently arrived at her home near Invergowrie,
Dundee).
Her roomy whitewashed house is set in a haven of garden and paddock
between the Tay and the rumble of traffic on the A85. Polished oak and
bric-a-brac and children's photos in the bathroom suggest the civilised
continuity of family living rather than the opulence of mega-success.
Graham, her husband of 50 years, is introduced, then tactfully withdraws
to another sunny sitting-room while his wife dispenses the remains of
the breakfast coffee.
Clad in blue denim skirt and spotted blouse, and with her sunburned
legs bare, Rosamunde Pilcher is a handsome woman who belies her calendar
age. Her eyes -- though brown not blue -- are reminiscent of a
seafarer's, crinkling as if to focus on distant horizons.
Coming Home is her first book in five years. Why the hiatus? She had
two years of ''a breather'' after September, she explains, then started
work again. At the halfway stage she spent a winter rewriting the new
book. ''So that's why it's taken so long.''
However successful it may prove it will have an uphill task to oust
The Shell Seekers as the public's favourite Pilcher novel. The Shell
Seekers may not be War and Peace (though it deals with both) but it is a
substantial book in more ways than size. How daring, to begin with, to
have as its central figure a 64-year-old woman with a weak heart, no sex
life, and three unendearing adult children.
Round this unpromising Penelope is woven a tale as memorable as that
of Odysseus' wife. Moving back and forward from the 1980s to the 1940s,
the novel explores the life of the tall, graceful artist's daughter who
finds marriage and love with two different men in the Second World War,
loses both, and is sustained by family and friendship for decades, only
to face the covetous attentions of her children when pictures inherited
from her father turn out to be worth a fortune. The melange of emotions,
scrupulous period detail, and shrewd human observation commands the
reader's attention to the end.
Analysing The Shell Seekers' success, its author says: ''I think it's
the universal appeal of family, really, and the complications of family
relationships.''
We soon find ourselves in animated discussion about Penelope's
unengaging offspring -- the materialistic Noel, Nancy of the middle-aged
spread and snobbish ways, and career-oriented Olivia. The fact that
fictional characters can be talked about as though real people, is
itself a testimony to the imaginative skill of the writer who has
conjured them into existence.
Does Rosamunde Pilcher see quite a lot of herself in Penelope? ''Not
really,'' she replies. ''Perhaps she was the person that I would have
liked to have been.'' The bohemian ambience in which the fictional
Penelope was brought up attracted her, though faced with similar
experiences author and character had ''completely different'' reactions.
For example, says Pilcher: ''I rather enjoyed the Wrens; she simply
loathed them.''
Richard, the love of Penelope's life, is killed on D-Day. Was there a
Richard in the author's life? ''No, not really. I never fell madly in
love with a man who was killed.''
The young Pilcher worked during the war for the Foreign Office in
Woburn Abbey. ''It was the headquarters of all the information going
into and coming out of Europe,'' she reminisces. ''There were a lot of
oddballs working there, very brilliant, rather strange people. We had
'outhouses' -- which sound like hens -- but they were in fact various
old houses which were never referred to by anything except code
numbers.''
Despite being at the heart of things, the teenage Pilcher found the
work quite tedious. Hence her joining the Wrens, with whom she served
both in Portsmouth and Ceylon (the latter place ''was stuffed with
Scotsmen'').
The Shell Seekers and her new book both deal with the war period but
most of her books, she says, are ''almost timeless. They're simply about
personal relationships.'' She started off with Mills and Boon but none
of these has been reprinted. ''I wrote them in my twenties and I wasn't
really all that proud of them.''
Does she find herself besieged by readers asking questions or
commenting on her characters? ''Yes, but not in the UK very much. People
are not so analytical here. Certainly the media is far more highbrow.
One can get a very fair and reasonable review in the New York Times or
Herald Tribune, but I've never had a review in The Times.''
She had about 5000 letters from Americans after The Shell Seekers was
published. ''Just shoals of them.'' Many were ''awful, humbling
letters'' saying very personal things like: ''It helped me through a bad
time when my son was killed on a motor bike,'' or ''I have been nursing
my husband through terminal cancer.''
In America, Rosamunde Pilcher muses: ''The family is just sacrosanct.
I think the attitude is that everything has to be just great. So it was
probably quite a relief to find other people had children you went on
loving but you didn't necessarily like.'' She laughs. ''And it's the
same with children. Children sometimes have parents they don't
particularly like.''
Rosamunde Pilcher, half Scottish by background but brought up in
Cornwall, will mark 50 years in Scotland next year. Much of September
was set here and a lot of her backlist. She shows me an illustrated
German book entitled The World of Rosamunde Pilcher, published in
Hamburg. The fact that such a book has been produced makes its own point
about public interest in her in Germany. ''Germany's almost more
enthusiastic than America,'' she reflects.
She doesn't really know the explanation, ''unless it's the old thing
of children, husband, and home,'' associated with ''large Germans with
plaits round their heads.'' Again, ''Shell Seekers was about the war.
They went through the war too and I think they rather liked hearing the
domestic side of it from this country. The publisher just bought it as a
book for his lighter imprint and simply couldn't believe it when it sat
in the best-seller list of Der Spiegel for two-and-a-half years, or two
years anyway. The reviews didn't come till the book had been in the
best-seller list for a long time. They said I was the Queen of Kitsch!''
She seems unfazed by this.
Kitsch, Shell Seekers is not, but there is a lot about kitchens and
domestic pleasures in it. Its author says: ''I'm not a madly brilliant
cook or anything but I think entertaining is one of the pleasures of
life and filling your house and producing a meal and a bottle of wine.
It doesn't need to be anything exotic or special. I think there's a
great therapy in ironing or putting a nice polish on tables.
''I like being with children too. The thing I hate about feminism is
that you've got to go into one stream. You don't have to do anything if
you're a woman. You can have a job if you want or you can stay at home
if you want, depending on your financial status. There's nothing
uncreative about being at home. In fact it's probably the most creative
thing in the world and one of the most important.''
One of the leitmotifs of her books is the possibility not only of
warm, pleasant relationships between people of the same sex but of
friendship, as opposed to love and high emotion, between the two sexes.
She points to a ''loving but totally unsexual'' relationship in her
new book. ''It's a lovely thing that you can be really friends with a
person or really love a man without wanting to go to bed with him. I
think I've always felt like that.''
She adds, somewhat unnecessarily: ''I'm not a bit prudish. So much is
written and analysed about sex, and every time you buy a magazine it's
telling you how to have what I call an organism!''
The lady is good fun. But then who doubted it?
Coming Home by Rosamunde Pilcher is published by Hodder and Stoughton
on August 24 at #16.99.

MORE than 20,000 people have signed a declaration expressing their
support for the bid by the Millennium Forest for Scotland for
multi-million pound funding.
Project manager Ms Penny Cousins said: ''The response has been
absolutely fantastic. We knew from our own experience how much the
Scottish public is behind this project but we wanted to be able to
demonstrate this to the Millennium Commission.''
The consortium behind the Millennium Forest initiative -- made up of
individuals, and conservation, community, and employment and training
groups -- wants to double the area of Scotland's native woods by the
year 2000, and claims it is set to become one of the first recipients of
cash from the Millennium Commission.
At the end of June, the commission announced that the Millennium
Forest bid had been selected for detailed appraisal.
Ms Cousins said: ''The Millennium Forest for Scotland stands out as
the only Scotland-wide proposal through to the next stage. With a high
level of community involvement and enormous environmental benefits to
the country as a whole, there are strong indications that this is the
type of project which the Millennium Commission finds particularly
attractive.''
Organisers are collecting signatures in Princes Street Gardens during
the first week of the Edinburgh International Festival.

New York
THREE airports went on high-security alert after receiving information
from law enforcement officers, officials said today.
The newspaper Newsday said the alert followed an FBI warning of a
possible attack by Islamic radicals, but the Port Authority, which
manages New York City's John F Kennedy and La Guardia airports and the
Newark, New Jersey, airport, would not confirm that.
''At some point on Saturday, there was communication between our
agency and the FAA, and a decision was made to elevate security at the
airports,'' an authority spokeswoman said. The FAA confirmed onlythat
information from law enforcement agencies prompted the alert.
Newsday said FBI anti-terrorist agents received detailed intelligence
that the Islamic resistance movement, Hamas, and Hezbollah were planning
a possible ''suicide massacre''.
The paper also said an attack would be in revenge for the US detention
of a key Hamas leader, Musa Abu Marzuk, pending an extradition request
from Israel. Hamas has warned President Bill Clinton of ''negative and
grave consequences'' for detaining Abu Marzuk.
Abu Marzuk's lawyer, Stanley Cohen, has denied any connection between
his client and possible Hamas attacks.--Reuter

this afternoon -- by the American captain, Lanny Wadkins.
Those who have played in the match before comprise the US Open
champion, Corey Pavin, Davis Love, Jay Haas, the Masters champion Ben
Crenshaw, and Peter Jacobsen.
Europe's 10 automatic places will be decided at the German Open in two
weeks' time and the captain, Bernard Gallacher, then decides on the two
other players. Leading European positions:
1, C Montgomerie (Scotland) 646,974pts; 2, B Langer (Germany) 566,481;

Baghdad
SHOPPERS in Baghdad today cursed the defector son-in-law of President
Saddam Hussein, Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel Hassan, blaming him for
steep price rises since he fled to Jordan last week.
''His blood has to be spilled in return for his treason,'' a woman
named Um Ali said of Hussein Kamel, Iraq's military mastermind who
defected with his brother and their wives -- both daughters of Saddam.
An old man said: ''He must be crazy. Why didn't he do what he wanted
to do while still here instead of fleeing with millions of dollars? That
is the way cowards behave.''
Food prices have soared since the high-level defections and the Iraqi
dinar has tumbled to new lows against the US dollar.
In Amman, Jordan was walking a political tightrope in sheltering
Hussein Kamel, who has used King Hussein's palace to call for the
toppling of the regime in Baghdad.
Officially, the Jordanian government maintains there is no change in
its policy towards its once powerful Iraqi neighbour and says it has
granted asylum to Hassan and his entourage on purely humanitarian
grounds.
However, officials and diplomats said granting the asylum was the
start of a decisive break between the two Arab leaders.
On Saturday, five days after the spectacular defection, Amman allowed
the general to hold a press conference at the guarded royal palace at
which he appealed for the overthrow of Saddam and hinted he might be
Iraq's future leader.
Hussein Kamel, looking calm and confident, said he planned to use
Amman as a base, at least for now, to shuttle to Arab and Western
capitals to lobby support for his effort.
''If we need anything, we will certainly ask the king,'' he told a
reporter.
However, apart from expressions of anger at the defectors, life on the
streets of the Iraqi capital appeared normal today.
One diplomat said he believed Saddam's government, struggling under
United Nations sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait five years
ago, was more concerned about runaway inflation than a possible coup
hatched by Hussein Kamel.
Another diplomat noted a statement today by Iraq's deputy premier
Tareq Aziz that Hussein Kamel had withheld data on Iraq's weapons
programme from the UN and Iraq was now ready to hand over the
information.
Aziz said General Amer Mohammed Rashid, who is now running Iraq's
Military Industrialisation Commission instead of Hussein Kamel, had sent
letters to UN official Rolf Ekeus and Hans Blix of the International
Atomic Energy Agency, inviting them to Baghdad to collect new data.

<TEXT>
THE creation of more than 2000 jobs and inward investment of #32m in
the year to March was not enough to help Fife lose its tag of worst
unemployment blackspot in Scotland, according to Fife Enterprise.
Despite the ''extremely encouraging'' progress -- with almost double
the previous year's total of jobs created -- more must be done, chairman
Mr Ray Baker says in the company's annual report.
Although the region suffered a blow with the announcement that Rosyth
naval base would close, the good news of major inward investment
projects, such as the #10m BSkyB management centre in Dunfermline and
the #9m AT &amp; T design and manufacturing facility at Dalgety Bay, proved
Fife's ability to compete internationally.
The report adds that Fife's inward investment success highlights the
effectiveness of the Invest in Fife one-stop economic development
partnership involving Fife Enterprise, Fife Regional Council, and
Glenrothes Development Corporation.
Throughout the year, Fife Enterprise helped 950 existing small
businesses and more than 450 new starts, which helped increase the
business creation rate by 20%.
Funding of #14.2m was also generated to support investment projects by
50 companies, while export assistance for 94 firms helped produce sales
of #12m as well as identifying potential sales worth #7m.
FE's commitment to ''highly targeted training and recruitment
initiatives'' increasingly focused attention on removing the barriers to
employment opportunities, the report adds.
Revealing that the company invested a total of #24m in a wide variety
of job creation, training, and environmental improvement projects, Mr
Baker said: ''While significant progress is being made, particularly in
inward investment, we cannot be complacent.
''Reducing the high levels of unemployment in Fife remains the
principal challenge to Fife Enterprise.''

SHADOW Foreign Secretary Robin Cook yesterday gave a strong warning
against a ''carve-up'' of Bosnia by the United States and Russia in the
interests of their ''client states''.
He commented: ''We are seeing a new form of partition based on
apartheid.''
Mr Cook said any deal which resulted in acceptance of ethnically
cleansed areas would be totally opposed to European values of toleration
and ''unacceptable''.
American and Russian negotiators are now seeking a solution to the
fighting in former Yugoslavia apparently based on acceptance of the
territorial gains and losses made in the fighting together with
''swopping'' of some territory to create areas almost totally Serb or
Croat.
Mr Cook said he was surprised there had been so little diplomatic
activity by Britain during what had been a very critical period.
He said what would be ''wholly unacceptable'' for Bosnia and Europe
was ''a carve-up'' of former Yugoslavia to suit the client states of the
US and Russia -- Croatia and Serbia.
He dismissed claims that Serb refugees in eastern Slovenia had left
the area voluntarily.
It was clear, he said, they had left in fear of their lives.
He called on Croatia to admit human rights monitors into the area
which they had so far refused to do.
''What is going on in former Yugoslavia is a form of ethnic cleansing
and the US seem prepared to be legitimising it,'' he said.
''We are seeing a new form of partition based on apartheid and I don't
think that European values of toleration and religious pluralism can be
content with that balance.''
He said the test of the US-Russian negotiation would be what happened
in Goradze. The US National Security Adviser Anthony Lake seemed to be
suggesting that the besieged Bosnian town with two other UN ''safe
areas'' Srebrenica and Zepa should be swapped for Serb held land around
Sarajevo.
This was first of all bargaining with UN protected areas which was
''extraordinary'' and also appeared to accept the outcome of ethnic
cleansing.

Sremska Raca
SERB men fleeing to Serbia from Croatia's rebel Krajina region were
blocked by border guards today, and protesting women and families
refused to go on without them.
Female refugees who crossed the border to pick up supplies described a
sea of tractors stretching for more than 12 miles past the Serb-held
town of Bijeljina, in eastern Bosnia.
Men, women, and children were camped in and around their vehicles
hoping for a change of policy, after hearing news of the border blockade
on local radio.
The refugees said the column, the tail end of an exodus of 150,000
people that fled Krajina after the rebel enclave was taken by the
Croatian army last weekend, had been stopped since mid-afternoon on
Saturday.
''These are mainly very poor peasants and farmers in this last wave,''
said UN aid agency spokesman Fernando Del Mundo.
''We left everything we had. There is nothing left for our men to
defend. So why can't our husbands come?'' asked Jasmina, 34, who fled
from the Krajina town of Petrinja.
Her husband and two children waited on the Bosnian Serb side of the
border while she walked 6 miles to get food and water.
''There is nothing for us on the other side, no water, no medicine. We
must come to the Red Cross for help,'' she said.
''We will wait as long as it takes to have our men come with us. We
won't go on without them,'' said Mira, 37, also from Petrinja, who said
she had been travelling for nine days.
Serbia said on Saturday that no more Krajina men could enter, and any
already in the country would have to go back and join the Bosnian Serb
army.
Diplomats in Belgrade said the ban appeared designed to encourage
families from remaining in Bosnia, reducing the refugee burden on the
impoverished sanctions-bound Serbian state.
The ban on military-age males would remove a potential source of
public disorder from disaffected men, aggrieved that Serbia failed to
come to the rescue of the Krajina Serbs, and would boost the undermanned
Bosnian Serb army, diplomats said.
''We would like to have (Serbian President Slobodan) Milosevic and
(Krajina Serb ''President'' Milan) Martic here to see what they have
done,'' said refugee Vesna, 23, visibly angry.
Asked what she would say to Milosevic, she said: ''Why did you sell us
out? Why didn't we fire a single bullet? In one hour it was over, and we
were on the road with nothing.''
Many refugees have complained that the defence of Krajina folded
without a fight, and soldiers were ordered to leave their posts by their
officers. Some said they suspected a deal between Milosevic and Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman.
Doctors at a medical tent said their biggest problem was transport to
move sick people, especially children, from the sprawling column on the
other side of the border to hospital.
''Today, we had to treat 10 babies suffering from dehydration or
diarrhoea,'' said Dr Slavko Arbanes.
''We've just been called about a 20-day-old baby with very high fever
about 12 miles down the column inside Bosnia. But we don't know if we
can get to him to bring help.''
Refugees described scenes of desperation and fear on the other side of
the border.

Sochi
RUSSIA and the United States met today to try to align their peace
plans for former Yugoslavia while fresh combat on the battlefields of
Bosnia underlined the difficulties ahead.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev and US National Security
Adviser Anthony Lake met in the Black Sea resort of Sochi as Bosnian
government forces launched an attack on Serb-held Donji Vakuf in central
Bosnia.
There was no immediate joint statement after today's talks, although
Kozyrev highlighted continued United Nations sanctions on the rump
Yugoslav state as one area of disagreement.
Bosnia's president today rejected any surrender of the eastern enclave
of Gorazde to separatist Serbs -- an option reported to be part of the
US proposals for peace.
Alija Izetbegovic said in a government television interview that the
Gorazde issue had come up today in a telephone conversation with US
vice-president Al Gore.
''I told him (Gore) we will not give up Gorazde if we have to fight
for the next 15 years,'' Izetbegovic said.
''He confirmed that whatever the initiative will be it will be based
on the sovereignty and integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina within its
internationally recognised borders.''
Izetbegovic said he awaited the arrival of US officials in Sarajevo on
Tuesday to learn the details of the plan.
Russia wants to ease sanctions against Belgrade to encourage
''reasanoble forces'' around Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
However, Kozyrev said after the talks today: ''In American thinking, it
looks like lifting or suspending sanctions is not the immediate task we
want it to be.''
Russia has been the main advocate of easing sanctions on Belgrade, its
traditional Slav partner, and President Boris Yeltsin has said it may
end the sanctions unilaterally unless the UN lifts them quickly.
Lake, on a whistle-stop tour of European countries, declined to talk
to reporters when he left Kozyrev's summer cottage in Sochi after talks
lasting two-and-a-half hours.
Yeltsin has called for direct talks between the leaders of Serbia,
Croatia and Bosnia to be followed by an international conference with
their participation.
He must soon decide how to respond to a non-binding resolution by the
Russian parliament on Saturday to abandon the sanctions imposed against
Belgrade for its support for rebel Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia.
The US administration, itself facing pressure from Congress to lift
the arms embargo against Bosnia's Muslim-led government, has warned
Moscow against such a step.
Despite such differences, Kozyrev today said Russia and the US both
backed the need to find a political solution to the conflict.
However, that made little impact on the frontlines and on the roads
now clogged by the latest flood of refugees, Serbs this time, fleeing
the Croat conquest of the Krajina region a week ago.
Although Bosnian government shelling dropped off around Donji Vakuf
today,a surge in small arms and machine-gun fire suggested infantry were
trying to advance into the Serb-held town, UN officials said.
The UN's Major Greg Thompson said: ''Government troops are active due
east of Donji Vakuf. We can't tell whether they've reached the town but
they can't be far off. We can't actually see them so this is all based
on what we are able to hear.''
At the UN's lone observation post in the area, on a hillside northeast
of Bugojno and overlooking Donji Vakuf, British soldiers were reported
to be sheltering in their Saxon armoured vehicles.
The government's objective seems to be the road from Donji Vakuf to
Turbe, which would provide an all-weather route between the Adriatic
coast and the heart of central Bosnia.
It marks the first major push by Bosnian Army troops since a major
offensive around Sarajevo in June stalled with significant losses and
minimal gains.
To the west, Bosnian Serb forces were battling Croat troops around the
town of Grahovo, recently captured by the Croats in a push that led to
the fall of the Serb-held Krajina.
Croat forces pounded the Serb-held town of Drvar with artillery
rounds, killing two people and damaging buildings.--Reuter

<HEADLINE>Delay in arms investigation a farce, says businessman</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976896148</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH businessman, arrested last month as part of the ''arms for
Iran'' inquiry, alleged yesterday that the Government was now
''desperate to be seen to be doing something'' after years of ignoring
available evidence.
Mr John Anderson, director of the firm BMARC until 1990, had just
received a reply from Customs and Excise to his complaints about the
arrest, which he had maintained was unjustified after he had voluntarily
travelled from his home in Fort Augustus to meet officers. He had also
complained that the interview was improperly conducted.
Mr C W Andrew, assistant chief investigating officer at Custom House
in London, wrote to Mr Anderson, saying: ''You have asked if my officers
were 'really investigating' or was it 'just another Government-inspired
intimidation'.
''Investigations by Customs are for the purpose of establishing
whether there have been any criminal offences. We do so as an
independent prosecuting authority of the Crown for the purpose of
initiating criminal proceedings where they would be justified. It is on
this basis and no other that decisions to investigate and whether to
initiate criminal proceedings are taken.''
But Mr Anderson retorted that it was ''absurd and insulting'' to
arrest him and former BMARC chairman Mr Gerald James for questioning
when they had for several years been willing to tell anyone who would
listen exactly what the firm was involved in.
It was the first time Customs and Excise had questioned Mr Anderson.
On arrival at Vigilant House, he was told that he was under arrest and,
when questioning was completed, that he was ''unarrested''.
Mr Anderson said that the interviewers were interested in two lines of
questioning -- whether he was still in possession of any material which
proved sales to Iran, and the role of Mr Jonathan Aitken, the former
Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who was previously a non-executive
director of BMARC.
Mr Anderson described the delay in investigating BMARC's dealings with
Iran as ''farcical''. He said that all the files relating to the sales
had been taken from the offices of BMARC and its parent company, Astra,
by Ministry of Defence police in April, 1990.
He had no doubt that the intelligence services had been fully aware at
all stages of BMARC's involvement, as well as that of other companies in
the embargo-breaching supply of arms to both Iran and Iraq.
Shortly before the parliamentary recess, following extensive scrutiny
of Mr Aitken's role, Mr Michael Heseltine claimed that it had only now
come to light that BMARC had been involved in illegal trade with Iran
during its war with Iraq.
He turned down demands for a full inquiry parallel to Sir Richard
Scott's Arms for Iraq investigation and the affair was referred instead
to the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, which will start its
investigations when the House of Commons resumes in October.
In a separate development, Mr Anderson and Mr James have claimed that
the Government is failing to meet a court order issued by the High Court
in London last month that the seized files of Astra and BMARC should be
made available to them.
Mr Anderson said yesterday that the list of files provided to him by
the Treasury solicitor, in response to the court order on July 25,
excluded Astra and BMARC board minutes for the 17-month period following
the MoD police raids. During this time, BMARC was sold to Royal Ordnance
and Astra went into administration.

STRATHCLYDE region's transport convener, Councillor Charles Gordon,
will today demand assurances from ScotRail that delays in repairing
trains, damaged in the Argyle line flooding before Christmas, will not
affect services when the line reopens next month.
In December, two Class 314 trains were badly damaged at Glasgow
Central when the line was flooded. Derby company ABB won the contract to
repair them against a bid from the St Rollox engineering works in
Springburn, Glasgow. But the contract is now running between six and
eight weeks late.
Councillor Gordon said: ''When are these sets going to be ready? If
they are not ready for the reopening of the line, I want to know what
are the operational consequences. Are we going to have trains cancelled
or trains under strength? Three coaches instead of six at a time when we
are launching a major marketing initiative to attract people back on to
the Argyle line?''
He added that as a Strathclyde councillor he was concerned at
allegations that the repairs could have been done in the West of
Scotland.
Mr Phil McGarry, the divisional organiser for Scotland of the Rail,
Maritime, and Transport workers' union, said: ''In the past, there would
not have been any fundamental problem when it was all under the one
umbrella of British Rail. People just got on with it.
''We argue that it should have been Scottish railway work for Scottish
railway workers.''
Ironically, the rolling stock had to be moved for repair to Derby by
road rather than rail, because it was cheaper.
A spokeswoman for ScotRail said that jobs had to go out to tender and
ABB had put in a bid for less money in a shorter time, even without the
current delay. ''We could not have justified giving it to St Rollox,''
she said.
However, she added: ''In hindsight, perhaps this is not as good a deal
as it looked. But at the time, ABB had the best tender. To be fair to
ABB, whoever got the contract would have had the same problem. The delay
has been caused by additional water damage being found, so more work
than originally thought has had to be done.''
The ScotRail spokeswoman added that the delay would not affect
services once the line reopened.
''If that set is not ready, we will simply use other sets. We do not
have a huge capacity of rolling stock, but there is some leeway built
in,'' she said.
Councillor Gordon also criticised Railtrack -- responsible for
reinstating the line, signalling, and Central low-level and Argyle
Street stations -- for not using the opportunity to upgrade facilities.
''The reinstatement of signalling is Railtrack's responsibility but it
is doing it from its own insurance cover for replacing like with like,
rather than anything more advanced,'' said Councillor Gordon.
''We (the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive) wanted to add
money to the pot and bring them up to a higher standard. But the
regional council advised us that the terms of investment in Railtrack in
projects at that time meant we would be putting too many risks on to the
council.
''When the Argyle line reopens, it will certainly look better and the
opportunity will have been taken to at least renew materials. But we had
hoped to take the opportunity to go to a slightly higher specification,
and that has not happened,'' he said.
A spokesman for Railtrack said that when the line reopened on
September 24, passengers would find that not only had the line been
reinstated, but the track slab replaced. At the Bridgeton and the
Exhibition Centre stations, there would be new customer information
systems, and escalators would also be renovated.
''Our concern has been to reopen the line in the fastest possible
timescale,'' he said.
By April, the company could not wait any longer for the council to
decide whether it would be investing any money in the project, he added.

FEMINIST publishing house, Virago, is breaking with its traditional
image by releasing a novel by a man. Diran Adebayo's book, Some Kind Of
Black, is to come out next June having won the first Saga prize for new
black fiction.
Adebayo received the award and a cheque for #3000 last night at the
Edinburgh Book Festival's Post Office Theatre. His London-based novel
was the unanimous choice of judges Margaret Busby, Steve Pope, and
Lennie Goodings, publishing director of Virago.
Founded by writer and actress, Marsha Hunt, the Saga prize aims to
promote a hitherto undernourished area of British writing by seeking out
the work of black writers born in Britain or Ireland.
The fact that Virago, which had previously restricted itself to male
authors who were dead, was now willing to take on a living one, has sent
tremors through the world of women's publishing.
However, Lennie Goodings justified the choice on the grounds that it
was consistent with the fight against established literary prejudices.
Adebayo was keen to point out the integrity of what Virago was doing.
He said: ''It's part of the tradition they've already had in place,
which is to encourage voices from the margin. If, as a guy, what I've
written fits in then it's part of that ethos.''

<HEADLINE>Labour leader to make discipline plea. Holiday over for Blair's detractors</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEN SMITH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Mr Tony Blair will return from his Italian holiday this
week to tell his restless MPs that they have to exercise more
self-discipline if the party is ever to be elected.
Sources close to Mr Blair say that he will remind them that winning
the next election is not a foregone conclusion, and that he has to
continue his modernising agenda if he is to win over voters who have not
previously supported Labour.
In Scotland, the row over Mr Blair's leadership has virtually split
the party into front benchers publicly supporting him while back
benchers criticise not so much Mr Blair himself but his autocratic style
of leadership, which suggests that back benchers feel more distant from
decision-making than ever before.
Any hopes that criticism of Mr Blair and his inner sanctum of advisers
was simply a passing fad were dashed at the weekend as former deputy
leader Mr Roy Hattersley, and then Scottish MPs at a meeting in Glasgow,
continued to open wounds on how the party was run.
Whether the outbreaks of criticism from within the party will coalesce
into any significant movement is difficult to predict. Certainly
critical motions of new Labour policies are well signposted for the
party's annual conference in October.
But before then Mr Blair will be reminding MPs and activists of the
discipline required to win the next election, which ought to be enough
to quell rebellion as many who have misgivings about Mr Blair's style
are willing to be extremely supportive in public for the greater good of
winning power.
As The Herald predicted, Saturday's meeting in Glasgow of the Campaign
for Socialism, a body set up to defend many of Labour's original values,
heard Falkirk West MP Dennis Canavan claim that there was considerable
concern about certain trends within the party and the ''trendy people
who are setting the trends''.
''No leader is infallible and it would be an abuse of leadership to
treat the membership as if they were mindless zombies,'' he said.
He warned: ''If certain trends continue, there is a danger that Labour
Party conference may become more and more like the Tory Party
conference, where the role of the party faithful is reduced to waving
flags and giving prolonged standing ovations to the leader.''
Mr Canavan told The Herald yesterday that Mr Blair had to listen to a
wider range of opinions within the party than simply taking advice from
a ''small coterie of special advisers who have no elected position and
who appear to be Johnnie-Come-Latelys as far as their Labour membership
is concerned''.
As for the criticism dying down, on the contrary Mr Canavan believes
that more people would be speaking out from right across the political
spectrum, pointing out that Mr Hattersley was hardly from the left-wing
of the party.
''I agree that not enough priority is being given to policies that
will help the poor, the disadvantaged, the dispossesed, the unemployed,
and the homeless -- the people who have suffered most from the past 16
years of Tory misrule.
''Part of the reason why there is not enough priority is that if you
look at the coterie of advisers who have almost the exclusive ear of the
leader, there are not many dispossesed, unemployed, or homeless among
them.''
Hillhead Labour MP George Galloway said discontent was undoubtedly
widespread and growing. He made it clear that he was personally not
critical of Mr Blair but said it was important to raise concerns now
rather than keeping quiet until after the election.
''The road to disaster is paved with the intention of just shutting up
and not rocking the boat,'' he stated.
''It is not our responsibility to be kind of lobotomised foot soldiers
for the New Blair Army,'' Mr Galloway told a radio interviewer.
''Leadership by fiat is not becoming in a democratic socialist party.''
Fellow Glasgow MP Mike Watson also criticised policy being made
without reference to the party, and argued that finding out about
policies through reading newspapers was not the way to run a democratic
party.
Mr Hattersley questioned whether Labour was pandering too much to the
middle-classes and had forgotten the disadvantaged in society.
But just as it appeared that the criticism was getting out of hand,
Scottish front-bench spokesmen leaped to Mr Blair's defence.
Glasgow MP Donald Dewar, the Shadow Social Security Secretary, said
that it was ''ludicrous'' to suggest the Labour leader was taking all
the power into his own hands, arguing that he had, in fact, given more
real power over the selection of leaders and over policy matters to
ordinary members of the party.
''We've got a few people who have been disquieted, but we've got a
Labour Party that has put on a third of its membership since Tony Blair
came in -- an enormous achievement in itself,'' he insisted.
Transport spokesman Henry McLeish said Labour was preparing for two
terms of office already, but that meant there was virtue in not coming
forward too early with specific policy and financial commitments.
Support did come from one Scottish Labour back bencher. Cumbernauld MP
Norman Hogg, who was a Scottish front-bench spokesman in the eighties,
said that Mr Hattersley had had his day. ''The harsh facts are the
Kinnock Hattersley leadership lost two elections. He has to explain the
election results in 1987 and 1992 before giving advice.''
* SNP leader Mr Alex Salmond attempted to add to Mr Blair's holiday
discomfort by claiming that the Labour leader and his advisers were
planning a ''pasta plot'' by using their time in Italy to discuss ways
of watering down Labour's devolution proposals for a Scottish
Parliament.

IN reply to Thomas R Curry (Rail travel costs, August 1), my
information comes from Basic Road Statistics 1994 published by the
British Road Federation, and from The Herald. I would add that I am
retired and have never been connected with any road or rail lobby. My
interest is the taxpayer, national and local.
In 1994-95 the tax revenues raised from road use will be about #24bn,
which is some four times the total expenditure on improving,
maintaining, and administering the road system, including policing. The
road taxation increases and planned reductions in road expenditure for
1995-6 will probably increase the ratio of taxes to road track costs to
near 5 to 1.
There is no proof that rail travel in Strathclyde, despite heavy
subsidy, is significantly above the national 7% or so.
I would also remind Mr Curry that the Glasgow-Carlisle line via
Kilmarnock is under used and could carry more freight. An improved
(faster) east coast line , Glasgow/Edinburgh to London, would be likely
to meet future passenger needs in competition with air and coach travel.
Do we need three main lines from Scotland to England? Would the
massive expenditure needed to upgrade (realign bends, radio signalling)
the line via Shap be cost effective?
It is very difficult to get real statistics on rail costs and revenue
(commercially sensitive?) but the letter from Dave Stewart (July 31) is
revealing.
He states that a dedicated diesel locomotive is hauling one (two)
sleeping coach(es) 200 miles between Edinburgh and Fort William with a
driver, second man, sleeping car attendant, and guard.
This is four operatives and a powerful locomotive for a maximum of 24
(48 Fridays and Sundays) passengers.
He pleads for the reintroduction of at least some budget seating, plus
couchette-style sleepers (no attendant necessary), and a bar/disco car
-- well within the capacity of the locomotive, with little increase in
fuel. Would passengers be willing to pay real economic fares?

RESIDENTS of an Edinburgh street yesterday spoke of a ''frightening''
series of fires which broke out within 50 minutes of each other and less
than 100 yards apart and which are believed to have been started
deliberately.
They said the three overnight blazes, which occurred outside flats in
tenement blocks in Stenhouse Drive on the west side of the city, could
have had tragic results.
As firefighters tackled these outbreaks they had to deal with flames
spotted coming from derelict garages only a few hundred yards away at
Carrick Knowe.
Fire units from nearby Sighthill fire station had to be reinforced, by
Lothian and Borders Fire Brigade colleagues from the Tollcross station
in the city centre, to cope with the incidents which led to police
bringing in tracker dogs.
One occupant of the Stenhouse Drive flats where front doors were set
alight said of the firefighters: ''They were running all over the place.
They must have been driven round the bend.''
Commenting on the Stenhouse Drive blazes Lothian and Borders Police
said they were investigating three ''malicious'' incidents where damage
had been caused by fire.
As well as the outbreaks at the flats and the garages, which happened
between 3.07am and 3.57am, firefighters at Sighthill received a call to
a fire at portable cabins at nearby Stevenson College at 1.40am and to
bins alight at flats at Sighthill Bank at 4.50am.
Mrs Carol Stemp, 35, who is expecting her second child soon, described
the situation as ''crazy''.
''Fortunately our son Gareth, who is asthmatic, is on holiday in Spain
at the moment. There was a lot of smoke in the stairway below us and we
were told to stay in our home. It was frightening,'' said Mrs Stemp.

Meanwhile, a valuable bronze statue removed by wheelbarrow from an
East Lothian gallery more than a year ago has been found buried in woods
near the scene of the raid.
Detectives, acting on information, made the discovery of the #24,000
work, known as Football Supporters, during a search yesterday of
woodlands near Haddington.
The recovery of the 26in-high statue -- said to be in good condition
-- comes only days before its creator, Ukrainian artist Valentin Znoba,
is due to arrive in Scotland to mount an exhibition of his work at the
festival.
Arrangements are now being made for Znoba to travel in person to
Haddington police station to collect the statue, which has three
figures, two sitting on a bench and another standing behind.
Yesterday the directors of the Sands Gallery at Haddington,
celebrating the discovery of the work, telephoned Kiev to tell the
sculptor it had been found safe and undamaged nearly 14 months after
what they termed had been ''a violent smash and grab raid''.
Gallery director Mrs Gill Bethell said last night: ''I can't express
enough our thanks to Lothian and Borders Police. The Ukrainian
Ambassador is a close friend of Valentin's and is coming to Edinburgh
soon to visit the exhibition.
''I feel so relieved that we have been able to tell him that one of
Ukraine's national treasures has been recovered.''
Mrs Bethell spoke of the ''pure coincidence'' that 50 of the artist's
works, some on loan from the Ukrainian National Museum of Fine Arts,
would be arriving overnight for the festival exhibition at Edinburgh's
Morningside Church.
Znoba himself will arrive on Wednesday and, once the work is collected
from the police station, it will take pride of place in the exhibition
at which a tribute will be on show to the police.
Mr John Bethell said they were ''gobsmacked'' about the find. ''I was
in Kiev just 10 days ago, going over an inventory of the pieces for the
exhibition. Valentin looked at me and asked if there was any news and I
told him not to give up hope.''
Last year there was a series of thefts involving statues in the
Lothians and at the time detectives did not rule out a link and the
possibility they were ''stolen-to-order'' raids.
Among items stolen were a #2000 bust from the foyer of Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary and a #10,000 classical statue of a winged god from a stately
home in East Lothian.

MINERS at the troubled Monktonhall colliery in Midlothian are facing a
new cash crisis with plans to float the company on the stock market
delayed.
The move has been postponed as Waverley Mining is looking at
alternative ways of raising #10m to develop the pit.
A senior Scottish mining official confirmed yesterday that the
colliery could be in trouble -- sadly, he said, because the miners
invested #10,000 of their own money into the venture.
Problems of coal output are thought to have occurred in developing a
seam, described as ''shallow'', which is a major problem in coal mining,
leaving the output potential of developing the mine below target
expectations.
In full production, and with a healthy output, the complex would be
considered a healthy prospect for flotation.
Personnel manager of Monktonhall Mineworkers Ltd, Mr Jackie Aitchison,
who was involved in the take-over of the pit as a workers'-style
co-operative from British Coal in 1992, was not available for comment
yesterday.
Chairman John Richards was also unavailable, as was the colliery
manager, and no-one on duty at the pit was prepared to comment.
The senior Scottish mining expert approached by The Herald yesterday,
said: ''It has always been a fear in mining circles in Scotland that
there was a danger of under-financing, with the possibility that new
finance, if necessary, would not be forthcoming.
''It would be sad if the pit is not able to survive. We must wait and
see.''
About 167 Monktonhall miners invested in the project.

HERE is a strange tale. In the French hill village of Le Monastier,
there is a monument to a great Scot. It is in the form of a cairn, with
an inscription indicating that it was from here that Robert Louis
Stevenson set off on a journey which he later immortalised in Travels
with a Donkey in the Cevennes.
There is a grander memorial to Stevenson in San Francisco, a national
park nearby is named after him, and his home in Western Samoa has been
transformed into a fine literary museum. Meanwhile in Scotland there is,
well, not much. In fact, there is not a single monument of note to our
most illustrious writer anywhere in the country.
Our cities are littered with statues of English sailors and
politicians, along with a variety of engineers and obscure philosophers,
but poor old RLS remains a prophet of romantic adventure without visible
honour in his own country. A century after his death, the best his
native Edinburgh has been able to come up with is a nondescript stone
tablet in Princes Street Gardens bearing the legend ''RLS a man of
letters 1850-1894''.
I went looking for it last week. A young woman at the Waverly tourist
office said she thought it was somewhere near the bandstand. Four bank
workers taking their lunch-break in the park were unable to help, but
they could direct me to the Scott Monument if I liked. I eventually
found it sticking out of the ground enigmatically, like a tombstone; its
inscription was barely legible.
Three lassies from Broxburn were lying on the grass nearby.
''Do you know who this RLS was?'' I asked them.
''Naw.''
''Robert Louis Stevenson.''
''Oh aye, Treasure Island.''
''Yes.''
''Is that his grave, then?''
For all that Edinburgh's city fathers seem to care, it might as well
be.
Admirers of Stevenson have long campaigned for a more fitting
memorial, but have been frustrated by squabbling among the conservative
burghers of Edinburgh over what form it should take, where it should be
placed -- and whether there should be one at all.
Ian Nimmo, a former editor of the Evening News, bravely suggested
Calton Hill would be an appropriate site; it was a favourite haunt of
Stevenson's, and it was where he sketched chapters of one of his first
published works, Edinburgh: Picturesque Notes. But a proposal to erect a
Victorian-style silhouette of Long John Silver on the hill raised howls
of protest from conservation groups that it would diminish the grandeur
of the site.
For those of you unfamiliar with this hallowed ground, it has several
interesting monuments already. At the main entrance there is a large
plaque to Saint Wolodymyr The Great, Ruler of Ukraine (in the tenth
century, I think). On the summit there is a pretentious, uncompleted,
fake Greek monument to soldiers of the Napoleonic Wars, and a bleak
Nelson's column memorably described by a former editor of the Scotsman
as resembling a bunch of concrete cotton reels.
The only monument of any size to a Scot is a grimy, circular
construction -- currently being restored at considerable cost --
dedicated to the memory of one Dugald Stewart. As we all know, of
course, this world-renowned figure was a professor of moral philosophy
at Edinburgh University in the early nineteenth century.
With splendid consistency, Edinburgh District Council has steadfastly
resisted public appeals for action on the issue, preferring to respond
half-heartedly to the initiatives of others. The latest was launched
last December, on the centenary of Stevenson's death, when the Scotsman
announced it would invite five sculptors to submit designs for a
memorial, and award #5000 to the winner. A judging panel was promptly
set up, chaired by the High Court Judge Lord Prosser, and enterprisingly
including two schoolchildren.
Nine months later, nothing much has happened. No sculptors have been
briefed, and with the newspaper having changed editors and been put up
for sale, doubts are being expressed about its commitment to the
project.
Curiously, the Robert Louis Stevenson Club, the authors of the
minimalist monument in Princes Street Gardens, is opposed to any further
schemes of this kind. It takes the debatable view that Stevenson would
not have wished it, and says it prefers to donate funds to a trust for
children with respiratory diseases, as a living memorial to the author
who suffered from tuberculosis throughout his life. A laudable sentiment
certainly, but not one which should preclude a more tangible tribute to
arguably the finest romantic novelist in the English language.
This week Edinburgh will be crammed with artistic types savouring
esoteric fringe activities such as naked lesbians swinging from
trapezes. That's fine by me, by the way -- a chacun son gout, I say. But
it seems a shame that the creator of the rather more memorable
characters of Long John Silver, David Balfour, and Dr Jekyll has been
waiting for more than a century for some formal recognition of his
immense talent.
If Edinburgh continues to drag its feet, we might wish to consider
another site, suggested obliquely by Stevenson himself. When asked in
1891 for his opinion on where to stage a Burns exhibition, he wrote
back: ''Glasgow, as the chief city of Scottish men, would do well.'' And
why not, indeed?

TWELVE months ago he was on the receiving end of criticism over a lack
of Scottish content in its programme.
Now the director of the Edinburgh International Festival is being
applauded by those who condemned him.
On the eve of last year's festival the Scottish National Party wrote
to Mr Brian McMaster, claiming that the event, as far as its recognition
of Scotland's heritage went, could be ''in Edgbaston rather than in
Edinburgh''.
Yesterday, as the festival officially got under way, Mr Paul Scott,
vice-president of the SNP and its arts and broadcasting spokesperson,
warmly welcomed the level of Scottish content this time round.
''If the Edinburgh Festival,'' Mr Scott said, ''is to be true to its
purpose and at its best, it must be Scottish as well as international --
taking Scotland to the world as well as bringing the world to Scotland.
''This year Mr McMaster and his team are to be congratulated for
including some first-class Scottish material.
''The adaptation of Alasdair Gray's Lanark in the Assembly Hall and
the folk songs from the Greig-Duncan collection which will be performed
in the Festival Theatre are particularly welcome.''
Mr Scott said that by including performances of outstanding Scottish
material and talent the festival could play an important part in
sustaining a sense of confidence in Scotland, not just during the
festival but all year round.
Around 100,000 people lined city centre streets for the Festival
Cavalcade which included dozens of floats. Among those involved in the
procession was American actress Diane Ladd.
The heat and volume of people took its toll with seven collapse cases
dealt with by Scottish Ambulance Service personnel within the first half
hour of the annual parade along Princes Street.
Last night, Mr McMaster commented: ''We are delighted that people are
pleased with the content of our programme.
''Events are included on merit, and it is rewarding for us to be
told.''
In an eve-of-festival message Scots Arts Minister the Earl of Lindsay
claimed that the event boosts the Scottish economy by more than #70m,
bringing in more than the equivalent of 3000 full-time jobs.

AS the world's greatest festival gets under way in Edinburgh today I
am thinking, with some family pride, of my great-grandfather, Gavin
Greig, an Aberdeenshire schoolmaster who undertook one of the most
daunting tasks in the history of Scottish culture.
From an early age, I would hear of his astonishing life from my
grandmother, the eldest and last survivor of his nine children.
She would tell of everyday life at the schoolhouse of Whitehill, in
the parish of New Deer, where her father became headmaster at 22 and
proceeded to create a centre of academic excellence which sent young
people into the world, at the age of 14, with such a well-rounded
education as to shame our allegedly more sophisticated society today.
A scholar of renown, he was visited by professors all the way from
Edinburgh to Berlin, who couldn't understand why a man of this calibre
would spend his days in rural Aberdeenshire when so much more awaited
him.
He tried to explain that he was thoroughly at home among the farming
folk of his native North-east. What's more, he had plays and novels to
write and running a country school gave him time for that. Those plays,
like Mains's Wooin', are still performed 100 years later and at least
one of his novels, Logie o' Buchan, remains in print.
As a contemporary of his distant cousin, Edvard Grieg, he was also a
brilliant musician and no mean composer. But with nine children about
his feet, I used to wonder how a man so dogged by ill health could have
found time and peace to express his art.
I still hadn't heard the half of it. In the early years of this
century he was asked to apply his scholarship to preserving that
particular wealth of North-east folk-song which had been passed down for
generations but mostly by word of mouth.
With the way the world was going even then, if somebody didn't get it
down on paper, much could soon disappear. So he undertook the task and
enlisted the help of an Aberdeenshire minister, the Rev James B Duncan
of Lynturk, near Alford, who had once, coincidentally, been a pupil at
the same Whitehill School where Greig was now headmaster. They could not
have imagined what they were taking on.
I heard from my grandmother how Gavin Greig would set out on his
bicycle, scouring the countryside for elderly people who remembered
those songs, perhaps in different versions, handed down from ancestors
whose memories stretched back to the 1700s.
After an evening in some remote croft, the man of the house would
''convoy'' Maister Greig to the road-end with a storm-lantern, suddenly
remembering a verse which had eluded him. So down they would crouch in
the lee of a bush and, by the light of the lamp, Greig would jot down
the missing verse. No tape-recorders then.
It went on for years, night after night, musical note by note, till
the two had amassed an astonishing 3300 songs with 3500 lyric versions,
gathered in the proportion of two-thirds by Greig and a third by Duncan
and hailed as a world-class effort.
They worked mostly by correspondence from different ends of
Aberdeenshire but very seldom met. Wasn't it typical of the time that,
after years of co-operation, they still addressed each other as ''Dear
Mr Duncan'' or ''Dear Mr Greig''?
On one occasion, in 1904, Duncan was giving a lecture within Greig's
district and the latter was naturally going to be there. In a subsequent
letter to ''Dear Mr Duncan,'' however, Greig apologises for missing an
event to which he had so looked forward.
At the last moment, he found that his bicycle had a flat tyre and, in
trying to pump it up, he succeeded only in breaking the pump! So he was
stranded at home, helpless and frustrated.
Their monumental task was only partially published at the time, with
the original manuscripts being entrusted to the King's College library
of Aberdeen University. Within our family, only my younger cousin, the
late Arthur Argo, had taken any real interest in the subject.
So would this great work ever be published? Mercifully, the fates
produced two brilliant people at the School of Scottish Studies in
Edinburgh, who immersed themselves completely in the task. Patrick
Shuldham-Shaw and Emily B Lyle began editing and preparing the
Greig-Duncan collection for publication.
Sadly, Shuldham-Shaw died before the first of the eight volumes
appeared in 1981. But Emily Lyle stuck to the task and remains a quiet,
modest lady who surely deserves the highest literary honour this country
can bestow.
What took me to Edinburgh the other day was the publication of volumes
five and six, for which she enlisted the editing skills of folk-singers
Adam McNaughtan and Elaine Petrie.
Side by side with this notable event, Edinburgh Festival director
Brian McMaster was there to launch the 21 concerts which begin tonight
at the Festival Theatre and will feature those songs from the
Greig-Duncan collection. There is even a compact disc, produced by
Greentrax Recordings.
Gavin Greig died in his fifties, in the early days of the First World
War; James Duncan survived him by three years -- two notable Scots who,
at last, are being given their due recognition. Wouldn't my dear old
granny have been delighted?

MOTORWAY protesters aim to take over a Strathclyde region planning
presentation today, promising it will be the first step in a seven-year
strategy to stop the #200m M74 extension.
Members of No M74, a small community group based in the Govanhill area
of Glasgow, are to march to Strathclyde House to demand a meeting with
councillors on the region's roads and transport committee. There, they
intend to hijack a planning film that details the proposed motorway
route and show their own protest video instead.
The group, most of whom were involved in the anti-M77 campaign, will
first deliver one of 600 letters to the Scottish Labour HQ, urging the
party's city council executive to throw its weight against the plans.
Strathclyde region recently completed the consultation period for the
M74 extension, to be built by 2002, which will link the A74 to the M8
and run through the city's South Side.
However, No M74 organiser Ms Rosie Kane said: ''The people along the
route have not been properly consulted and most of them do not even know
the region has plans available for inspection.
''Like me, they will be horrified to learn that a whole part of south
Glasgow is to be surrounded by motorway. Its slip roads will pollute the
area and endanger kids.''
However, a Strathclyde region spokesman claimed the council had been
involved in a ''full and extensive'' consultation process.
He said the motorway would ease the heavy traffic flow from the A74 to
the city centre through the East End of Glasgow and added: ''Social and
environmental studies commissioned by the council point to this being a
very positive step for the South Side community.''
Meanwhile, Glasgow For People, the environmental pressure group,
yesterday claimed the proposed M74 extension had ''cast a blight over
Glasgow's South Side'' and said it had evidence several companies in the
affected area already planned to relocate.
Campaigns officer Mr Ian Cowan called the motorway proposals ''a
sixties solution to a nineties problem''.
* Britain's motorways are among the safest in Europe and introducing
tolls could actually increase accidents, it was claimed yesterday.
Only Holland has safer motorways in terms of deaths per vehicle
kilometres travelled, said the Association of British Drivers. The least
safe European motorways were those with toll charges, according to
figures produced by the association.
The Government is currently investigating the technology needed to
introduce electronic tolling on motorways. A trial is to be set up on
the M3 in Hampshire next summer.

MANAGEMENT at BBC Scotland yesterday played down claims they had
scrapped the usual television coverage of the Royal National Mod.
However, insiders at the corporation's Glasgow headquarters insisted
that a new round of cuts in Scotland, and expensive new Gaelic shows,
had curtailed the comprehensive 11-year coverage of the annual Gaelic
festival, held this year at Golspie in Sutherland.
Meanwhile, the chief executive of Mod organisers An Comunn Gaidhealach
confirmed there were problems with the BBC's contract. He agreed he only
expected ''a couple'' of TV programmes from the Mod to be screened this
year.
Programme chiefs in Glasgow were said to have wielded the axe despite
excellent ratings in previous years. They were said to be concerned
about the strain on the Gaelic TV budget because of new series such as
Ran Dan.
The programme, a departure from the kinship, kilts, and kids approach
of Gaelic TV in recent years, is a comedy sketch series which began
filming last week in Stornoway.
The corporation's usual week-long series of bilingual Mod competition
reports and fringe ceilidhs had proved very popular. Since 1984, BBC
Scotland had covered the festival extensively with nightly programmes
and, in some years, afternoon sequences.
At the weekend, Mr Donald John MacSween, chief executive of An Comunn,
tried to play down any disappointment at the diminishing profile of the
annual showcase of Gaelic talent. He takes heart that An Comunn will at
least receive a #6000 fee for letting the BBC have full access and
rights.
A BBC Scotland spokeswoman was yesterday still insisting that no
decision about the extent of TV coverage of the Golspie Mod had been
made.
She said: ''It's all very much still in the planning stages. We do not
expect to make an announcement until September.''

CALL me an intuitive old hack, but somehow I fancy that not featuring
among the last-minute tasks undertaken by Mr Tony Blair before he left
for the relative cool of Italy was a phone call to Alex Salmond advising
the SNP leader how he, Bambi, would spend his hols. So when our Alex was
quoted all over yesterday's airwaves suggesting that the Italian sojourn
was to be spent watering down devolution policy in the same fashion as
the Clause 4 sanitisation strategy, he was not so much giving us
information from the horse's mouth, as words put into them.
But then he is, bless him, a politician, and as we have been reminded
since the return to these shores of Mr Michael Forsyth, the smarter
babes of that breed know how to exploit a quiet news day with the aid of
a judiciously fired heat-seeking press release.
However, Mr Salmond's motives for mischief-making are less important
than the question he raises. For truth to tell it is not just in the
ranks of battle-hardened Nats that doubts about the full conviction of
the Labour Leader to the speedy implementation of a Scottish parliament
are harboured. The way in which an incoming Labour Government honours
its devolution commitment is also the subject of much heartsearching
among Mr Blair's own paid-up party tartan groupies. And the louder
senior Shadow Ministers proclaim that commitment to be unshakeable, the
louder come whispers of unease from the rear.
Not just from the classes given to constant chattering either. You
hear people argue that if Labour has a large majority it will have no
need to be held to ransom by the troublesome, impatient Scots in its
ranks. You hear them argue that if Labour has a small majority nobody
will dare rock the boat if there's some slippage on the promise. You
hear people wonder if the North-east or the South-east or just about any
other English region you care to nominate will happily play
parliamentary patience while the complex enabling legislation is taken
through the house.
One of the reasons that John Smith kept referring to a Scottish
parliament as unfinished business was the fact he well remembered the
hours he spent on his feet over a two-year span getting the mark one
Bill in place only to watch it torpedoed in one night of kamikaze
madness.
Now these fears may be entirely groundless. They may be based on
nothing more than the Labour Party being led by a man with whom many
Scots are less instinctively comfortable than they were with the
quintessential Scottishness of John Smith. They may merely be a product
of national paranoia given that similarly high hopes were spectacularly
dashed once before. So maybe the doubters are not so much sceptical as
plain feart.
Nevertheless it's probably fair to ponder on the quality and nature of
advice Tony Blair is receiving on a subject dear to most Scots hearts,
but undoubtedly peripheral to the concerns of most Labour insiders furth
of Scotland.
Recently I spent a couple of very pleasant evenings at dinner parties
both of which, coincidentally, had been set up to let some London-based
institutions talk to Scots about how their relationship with Scotland
might alter should there be a Scottish parliament with significant
powers. Both were entirely congenial occasions. But on both nights the
Scots guests were positively astounded at the level of ignorance of
Scottish politics displayed by the London variety.
It became quite clear not only that the devolution debate had only
just begun in their backyard, but that they thought it had in ours too.
They just hadn't a clue about either the intensity of that debate, or
its importance. And I don't think they are in any sense unique.
Now there is no shortage of Scots within whispering distance of Tony
Blair's ear in London. And if a Fettes education doesn't quite qualify
you as a lad o' pairts, it does give you a certain level of basic
knowledge about the constitutional arguments.
But in the light of these recent encounters with several senior voices
from the London establishment I begin to wonder if anyone down there has
really been listening these past 20 years.
I would guess it's fair to assume that Labour will not wait till the
English regions sort out their priorities before implementing Scottish
legislation. (Otherwise my interest in the Act in question would almost
certainly be posthumous.) But can we also assume that the party fully
understand the urgency felt by their Scottish troops, and indeed Scots
voters of sundry other persuasions, over Labour not just delivering, but
delivering on the timescale promised? One comforting development has
been the setting up of a Constitution Unit to do some preliminary
groundwork on the kind of time-consuming small print necessary before
the legislation can be framed. An anomaly anticipated is a delay
avoided.
The fact that it is a free-standing group rich in experience and not
beholden to political masters of any hue makes it even more valuable. A
new government seriously interested in devolution should be properly
grateful for such noble efforts and make appropriate use of them.
A more positive PS to all of which is the increasing number of
talented Scots who have pronounced themselves interested in standing for
parliament here after a lifetime of eschewing the dubious pleasures of
Westminister. Fears then of a Strathclyde writ larger seem to be greatly
exaggerated. Mind you we still have to find ways of ensuring that all
the Scottish parties and their  assorted selection procedures are
reprogrammed to avoid picking Buggins. That may take more than a few
frontal lobotomies.

<TEXT>
ANYONE tempted to dismiss the scenes of violence from Northern Ireland
over the weekend as an inevitable part of a peace process which
progresses by fits and starts should think again. The marching season is
a misleadingly comical description of many hundreds of street-level
provocations perpetrated by both sides of Northern Ireland's community
but most persistently, and with the greatest gusto, by the Protestant
section. The routes and the very fact of the marches serve to raise
tensions in countless communities and, as we have been reminded this
weekend, it was the traditional march of the Apprentice Boys of Derry in
1969 which led directly to riots and to the subsequent involvement of
British troops on Northern Ireland's streets. Likewise, the occasion
over the weekend of marches in Derry and Belfast was transformed into
disgraceful scenes of rioting and violence. There is, however, little
point in arguing here about chicken-or-egg situations. It really doesn't
matter a whit whether the march or the ensuing and reactive violence
should carry the major blame for a deterioration of relations between
communities and a dimunition in hopes of peace: both elements play their
part and both are culpable.
Caught haplessly in the middle is the RUC which is charged with the
task of allowing or disallowing marches and approving or vetoing routes.
In this situation the RUC is the easiest target of all. Whatever the
decision taken on individual marches, one side of the community will
inevitably be disappointed. Having been forced into a decision the RUC
must then cope with the ensuing march and try to deal with any violence
or disturbance which might occur. It is literally a thankless task and
being wise after the event is not always helpful. Nevertheless it does
seem unfortunate that the march along south Belfast's Ormeau Road was
allowed when over the years the human composition of the streets which
abut the main road has become largely Catholic. Similarly, if the walls
of Derry have been closed to marches since 1969 because the circuit of
the walls overlooks Catholic areas, the current state of the peace
process is not a sufficiently good excuse to reopen the walls to marches
and abuse, as happened at the weekend. If proof of this were needed it
is only necessary to recall the weekend scenes of RUC officers firing
plastic bullets and of the reappearance of the masked thugs and
provocateurs with their pre-prepared petrol bombs.
The argument over whether marches should be allowed or not is an old
one. Everyone should be allowed to march to express their opinion or to
celebrate what is important to them, but nobody should be allowed to
provoke or insult his neighbours by intent or even by noisy proximity.
Reconciling these two demands is the job of the RUC and, despite the
events of the past weekend, its officers deserve the respect and
goodwill of everyone in Northern Ireland for their efforts. Where this
leaves the peace process is anybody's guess. Mr Gerry Adams made an
unhelpful speech yesterday in which he claimed that the British
Government was strangling the process. This is silly rhetoric, although
it was expected in the context in which he spoke. Nevertheless there is
a need for some movement and it would be unwise for the memory of the
weekend riots to linger without the dissipating effect of progress on
peace. Thankfully the marching season is almost ended. Now is the time
for recalling the very real benefits which have come already from the
peace process and for initiating new discussions as soon as possible and
certainly not later than the middle of next month. Talking, not
marching, is the way forward.

SCOTTISH cricket was saddened by the death at the weekend of Hugh
Stevenson from a heart attack in Dublin, where he was match manager for
Scotland's annual three-day game with Ireland. He was 60.
Born and bred in Coatbridge, Mr Stevenson was a distinguished
sportsman. He played football for Queen's Park in the 1950s, and was
captain of Western Union cricket side Drumpellier.
After his playing days he became secretary and later president of
Drumpellier. He was also involved at national level, serving the
Scottish Cricket Union as chairman of selectors.
In 1992 he was tour manager on Scotland's history-making trip to South
Africa, when the Scots became the first representative side to visit
after sanctions were lifted.
SCU general manager Alex Ritchie led the tributes to Mr Stevenson,
saying: ''Hugh was a tireless worker for the game of cricket. His
enthusiasm was infectious.''
Mr David McDougall, now chairman of Drumpellier and a former
team-mate, added: ''Hugh was a tremendous servant of this club at so
many levels. He was a talented player and a fine captain.''
Mr Stevenson retired earlier this year from his job with United
Biscuits. He is survived by his wife Jean, son Alan, current captain of
Drumpellier, and daughter Amanda, who was married last week and was on
honeymoon in Barbados when told of her father's death.

LABOUR having launched a ''summer heat on the Tories'' campaign found
last week that they were getting a little hot under the collar
themselves. The activities of the ''loony left''-led council in Walsall
hit the headlines and up until now private mutterings about policy
making under Tony Blair surfaced in an article by Labour MP Richard
Burden.
This was followed up by Scots left wingers fulminating about
''trendies'' influencing the leadership. When former deputy leader Roy
Hattersley weighed in as well, Mr Blair, still holidaying in Tuscany,
began to look beleaguered not just by the Old Left but by the Old Right.
Mr Blair's critics will step up their activities at October's party
conference. The Tories now have in Dr Brian Mawhinney a chairman well
able to exploit Labour difficulties. Tory divisions are unlikely to go
away but they should be able to get across to the voters that all is not
sweetness and light on the left.
Just how serious a threat to Labour's prospects are these issues which
have suddenly sprung up -- suddenly that is, as far as public awareness
is concerned?
''Loony left'' councils are quite serious. As a Blair supporter
remarked to me, ''they are playing with people's real lives''. The
activities of hard-left councils have hurt Labour badly in past General
Elections. Media publicity guarantees the impression being conveyed that
such councils are more numerous than they actually are. Citizen Dave
Church's idea of splitting Walsall into quite small neighbourhood
communities -- or Soviets as Dr Mawhinney will doubtless call them --
may be an imaginative way of extending local democracy and bringing
power to the people. But at Walworth Road they have other descriptions
for it and do not propose to let the experiment be conducted -- at least
in the name of the Labour Party -- in the run up to the next election.
Controlling the national executive as he does, Mr Blair holds most of
the cards in this dispute. He is also well aware that much Tory
propaganda about the ''hard left'' can be effectively neutralised if he
is seen cracking down on these groups. Mr Kinnock was never so popular
as when he publicly took on Militant.
Unrest within the party falls into two categories. Most of those who
have surfaced in the past week are traditional left wingers annoyed
about the abolition of Clause 4 and the leadership's tightening grip on
the party conference as a means of making policy decisions. Mr Blair
never has had a real honeymoon with this group and never will have. He
simply seemed too popular to attack profitably.
Even now criticisms are aimed at those unelected elitists who are, it
is claimed, unduly influencing the leader. Mr Blair is not in my
judgment an easy man to influence unduly so the criticisms are really a
smokescreen for attacks on him.
However, criticism from Mr Hattersley and even the little-known Mr
Burden is more serious as it comes closer to the worries of a larger
group of Labour MPs who are never going to speak out against Mr Blair
but are uneasy at some aspects of his leadership. It is true, as Mr
Norman Hogg reminded him, that Mr Hattersley had the policies for the
poor and education he wanted in place during his days in power. Whatever
their merits they did not get Labour elected.
Some commentators see Labour as still in a perpetual impasse between
the policies activists want and the policies or lack of them needed to
get elected. This impasse is publicised at least annually at the party
conference where activists demand true socialist policies and the
leadership calls for policies more voters will support.
The difficulty is that ''socialism'' means different things to members
of the same ''socialist'' party, if that is what Labour still is. Mr
Blair believes that the great advantage he now has lies in the
recruitment of large numbers of new members who have a strong desire to
see a different approach to governing Britain from the Tories but do not
carry the ideological baggage of left wingers who made up substantial
proportions of constituency parties.
He is probably right about that but the Walsall phenomenon indicates a
potential problem. How many of the new reform-minded members will be
active members? If they are simply content to vote in the odd ballot but
not get involved then a comparatively small number of hard-left members
will still be able to dominate some local parties and councils. However
impressive a leader may be, no national party can be a one-man band. Mr
Blair needs the active support of the new recruits to sustain his ''new
reformed Labour Party'' both now, to make clear that the great majority
of the membership support him, and in the future, if Labour comes to
power, when he's in trouble as all Prime Ministers are from time to
time.
Next week I will try to analyse what the ''New Labour'' approach is
that they will be called on to stand by.

APOLOGIES cost nothing, or so we are brought up to believe. But in
order to apologise one must first have something to apologise for,
something one regrets having done. As far as many Japanese are concerned
they have nothing to apologise for over the way they treated the Second
World War prisoners who laboured on their railways, were detained in
their camps, and died at their hands. It seemed last week that the
apology, long sought by Britain, from Japan for its war crimes -- some
12,433 British prisoners died at the hands of the Japanese -- had at
last been made. Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in a letter to John
Major, received on Friday, was said by Downing Street to have expressed
not merely ''profound remorse for Japan's actions'' but also
''apologies'' to Britain. The contents of the letter, written in
Japanese, were welcomed by veterans' organisations and all seemed well
until Mr Murayama denied it was a letter of apology. He had, according
to the Japanese news agency Kyodo been writing to congratulate Mr Major
on his re-election as Tory leader. Remorse had been expressed, but no
more. Downing Street is apparently satisfied that the word ''apologies''
is in the text and the Japanese Embassy in London added to the confusion
by confirming the Downing Street version and saying that, as a Prime
Minister to Prime Minister letter, it was on behalf of the Japanese
people.
Mr Murayama, who heads a fragile coalition government, should seize
his opportunity tomorrow when he addresses the Tokyo Parliament on the
anniversary of the Emperor Hirohito's surrender broadcast to clear up
this ridiculous confusion. He should state whether he apologised in the
letter and, if that is the case, repeat the apology so that his meaning
is not in doubt. He is undoubtedly under pressure from nationalist
factions in Japan opposed to any such action, and the question is
whether he can face up to them, thus risking the coalition. The Mayor of
Hiroshima, Takago Hiraoka, where 140,000 Japanese died when the first
atomic bomb was dropped, and a further 60,000 died from radiation
sickness in the following months, said at a memorial service last week
that the Japanese wanted to apologise for ''the unbearable suffering
Japanese colonial domination and war had inflicted on so many people''.
If Mr Hiraoka can bring himself to utter such words, Mr Murayama, who
appears to have said as much in the letter, if Downing Street is right,
should try again. There is a price for making the apology, but the price
here is worth paying.
The problem with such anniversaries is people expect them to be used
for different purposes, too many people want them to be marked in some
special way, and too many suggest how they might be marked without being
in a position to fulfil their suggestion. We may feel this fiftieth
anniversary of VJ Day is the time for an apology from Japan, but that is
no reason why the Japanese should feel the same way. Mr Murayama's
ramshackle coalition was recently nearly brought down over the issue and
he may well have felt last week that he could go no further in the
circumstances. Unfortunately things have moved on, confusion reigns, and
a clear apology to defuse a sorry international row is required. The
ceremonies -- celebrations is quite the wrong word -- to mark the end of
the war with Japan, if they are to serve any purpose, should be aimed at
promoting international understanding, and possibly smoothing the way to
some agreed compensation for the surviving victims. This bickering
hinders all that.

<HEADLINE>Council in move to ban jet skis from loch</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976896168</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
POWER boats and jet skis would be banned from an Ayrshire loch under a
proposed by-law being examined by the Scottish Office.
The by-law was drafted by Cumnock and Doon Valley District Council
after fears that Loch Doon, near Dalmellington, was becoming swamped at
weekends by water sports enthusiasts, forced to look elsewhere after the
introduction of tough new rules for Loch Lomond.
The move is backed by local residents, ScottishPower, the Forestry
Commission, and fishing and outdoor activities clubs using the loch,
which is designated a site of special scientific interest.
Councillor Rab Taylor, who represents Dalmellington, said yesterday:
''People have been turning up from all over putting jet skis and
speedboats into the water and causing mayhem.
''For some time now, the council has been trying to introduce limited
development of Loch Doon to encourage activities such as fishing and
swimming. We have had a massive response to our consultation exercise
with over 50 letters of support.
''There were one or two responses that asked for some minor changes to
the phraseology of the draft by-law, which allows for exceptions.''
If approved, the by-law would ban jet skis and boats with engines of
4.5hp or over. Rescue and licensed fishing club vessels would be exempt.
ScottishPower, which has dammed parts of the loch for hydro
electricity, and the Forestry Commission, which owns much of the
surrounding land, are firmly backing the move.
The seven-mile long loch is also used by two fishing clubs,
Craigmalloch Outdoor Centre which is run by Strathclyde Regional
Council's community education department, and the privately-owned
Lochhead Residential Outdoor Activities Centre. Both have been consulted
and are backing the proposals.
Mr Robert Farrell, manager of Lochhead residential outdoor activity
centre, said: ''The by-law is a good idea because it will cut down the
chances of an accident with more and more people coming here every year
with jet skis and power boats.
''The local fishing clubs complained that the jet skis were their
biggest hassle but there are power boats being driven by people not
looking where they are going.''
Council officials took the initiative to safeguard the area, which is
a haven for many species of wildlife including protected birds of prey.
The nearby Rinns Of Kells hills have also been put forward for
consideration under the EU's habitats directive as a special area of
conservation.
Councillor Taylor said: ''We seem to be getting there with this and
the people are supporting it. We don't want to spoil people's fun but it
was high time regulations were brought in for everybody's safety and for
the environment.''
The council has sent the draft by-law to the Scottish Office for
advice and the matter is to be continued for consideration until next
month.

THE GLASGOW ENLIGHTENMENT
Andrew Hook and Richard Sher (eds)
Tuckwell Press: #20
''THERE is an important sense in which the history of the Scottish
Enlightenment is the history of Edinburgh,'' wrote Nicholas Phillipson
more than 20 years ago. With hindsight, this looks like a highly
imprudent remark. Several people, including the authors of this book,
have set out to debunk it, by and large to good effect.
They show us that the Scottish Enlightenment was much more widely
diffused than some of its theorists have been willing to allow. This has
important implications for our whole view of it.
An obvious starting point is to demonstrate that other Scottish cities
enjoyed Enlightenments too. Enlightened Dundee may still await its
chronicler but, remarkably, Aberdeen struck back first, and a
lengthening list of works documents its contribution. Now that this
volume has appeared, however, there can be little doubt that Glasgow's
Enlightenment was a greater one.
What made a Scottish city enlightened? If we compare the three that
certainly did have an Enlightenment with the one that probably did not,
what sticks out is the presence of a university.
In the case of Glasgow this was especially crucial. Indeed, there is
an important sense in which the history of the Glaswegian Enlightenment
is the history of the university.
Its constellation of stars was no less brilliant -- perhaps more
brilliant -- than Edinburgh's. Francis Hutcheson placed moral philosophy
at the centre of Scottish thinking. William Leechman brought Moderate
theology to a city of hoary Presbyterians. Adam Smith could hardly have
written The Wealth of Nations without experience of its burgeoning
commerce. Thomas Reid pioneered the distinctive Scottish school of
Common Sense. John Anderson took science to the people. John Millar was
the prophet of liberal legal philosophy.
To each of them, this volume devotes an excellent essay. There can be
no further question of Glasgow's high intellectual distinction in the
eighteenth century.
We may then well ask why scholars such as Phillipson have been able to
ignore it, and keep a blinkered gaze fixed on Edinburgh. He did stress
the diffusion of enlightened principles, and pointed to the facets of
urban life which permitted this.
The capital relaxed in convivial intellectual clubs where great minds
could mix with lesser ones. The Moderate clergy hogged its pulpits,
whence the populace was instructed. At the heart of the city's affairs
lay a legal and landed establishment, often drawn from old families
though still having to come to terms with the progress of society.
Much of this was absent from Glasgow, or not present in the same form.
Clubs there were in plenty, but composed of merchants, who spent more
time striking deals than discussing their relationship to Aristotle. The
clerics were usually of the tub-thumping, if not bigoted, variety. The
city's establishment rested on money rather than on blood, acres, and
high-mindedness.
There are two articles on the city's religious life, by Ned Landsman
on disputes over patronage in the churches, and by Kent Donovan on a
clerical view of the American Revolution. Both authors are American, and
seem to wish to discover support for their revolution, so that they
tend, to my mind, to exaggerate the political liberalism of Scots
evangelicals.
These did talk a great deal about liberty, but in the special sense of
Presbyterian liberty: the principle that the Kirk was the equal of the
state and should be free of interference by it. Otherwise they could be
extremely intolerant. They would have denied civil rights to Roman
Catholics, for example, and later did not hesitate to damn the French
Revolution, a matter which is here ignored.
Still, I am sure Landsman is right to call attention to ''cultural
trends far removed from those of Scotland's celebrated literati''. He
goes on: ''Glasgow's merchants and tradesmen developed their own
evangelical or tradesmen's enlightenment of the literati to the growth,
development, and modernisation of the commercial city of Glasgow.'' That
certainly takes us along the right track, even if the map is not yet
completely true.
As we head off in this different direction, we can look back and begin
to understand why Nicholas Phillipson got things so wrong. He defined
Enlightenment as what happened in Edinburgh, and remained blind to the
Enlightenment in Glasgow, because his view of the Enlightenment was too
narrow, and above all too elitist. He also derived his model of the
Enlightenment from things that were going on elsewhere, in England or in
France, and tried to fit Scotland to them.
The strength of this book is to start out from what actually happened
in Scotland, and try to say what about it could be defined as
enlightened. This approach strikes me as the right one, though the
accuracy of particular judgments can naturally be questioned.
Nowhere are the problems drawn out with greater skill than in Richard
Sher's essay on two forgotten poets, John Mayne and Robert Galloway, who
wrote bad popular doggerel about the rapidly changing Glasgow of the
late eighteenth century. The poetry may be bad, but it gives us the
human touch, an insight into how the deeper forces of the age operated
on the mind of the people.
For Mayne, they ''constituted a miraculous phenomenon of economic
opportunity and visionary civic enterprise''. For Galloway, ''the good
old values of the city, symbolised by simple, virtuous attire and the
rock-solid stability of the Glasgow Tron, were being corrupted and
destroyed by the new spirit of acquisition and growth.''
Not everyone was happy; but a new age, a great destiny, awaited the
city.

MADE in Scotland from girders? Well, almost, though the structure
teetered somewhat at the last pillar. The music programme of this year's
Edinburgh Festival was launched yesterday afternoon, not with the
typical blockbuster concert -- that followed last night -- but with a
programme of Scottish contemporary music, the first of three that will
run on consecutive Sunday afternoons throughout the Festival.
Every programme will feature the world premiere performance of a BBC
commission -- the series is being run in conjunction with BBC Scotland.
Yesterday's new piece -- the last on the programme -- and, sadly, its
weakest link, was by John Lunn, a Glasgow-born composer now resident in
London.
Lunn's new piece, A Tonic for the Dominant?, reflects his multiple
interests -- he has worked in rock, jazz, and television genres -- as
well as in classical. A largely slow, soulful, and bluesy little opus,
it was suffused with Gershwin harmonies, echoes of Miles Davis, touches
of late Beethoven, and a dollop of Messiaen's Quartet for the End of
Time.
The problem with all this, simply, was the total result. It was
stylistically amorphous, almost as though the piece had no independent
persona, and it sounded in parts as though it had been written in a
hurry.
The rest, performed brilliantly by the Chamber Group of Scotland, was
pure steel: William Sweeney's searing Life Studies, Sally Beamish's
mobile Iasg, and, in John McLeod's dramatic Song of Dionysius, a
performance of blazing virtuosity from percussionist Heather Corbett.

THE Law Society is today launching an insurance scheme in England and
Wales to protect people involved in personal injury cases from being
landed with big legal bills.
The scheme is designed to ensure that clients who employ lawyers on a
''no win, no fee'' basis are not left having to pay their opponents'
legal fees if their case fails.
Previously, although clients employing lawyers under the so-called
conditional fee system were in no danger of having to pay their own
lawyers unless they won their case, they were still potentially liable
for their opponents' often substantial costs if they lost.
Under the new scheme, Accident Line Protect, for a fee of #85 clients
will be insured against having to pay their opponents' fees even if
their case fails. They are also insured against having to pay other
expenses, such as court charges.
Mr Kenneth Pritchard, secretary of The Law Society of Scotland, said
last night: ''The Law Society of Scotland has been looking at this
scheme, but we have serious reservations about its viability.''

Sir David Steel and Lama Yeshe, abbot of the Samye-Ling Tibetan
centre, near Eskdalemuir, Dumfriesshire, accompanied by the Liberal
Democrat MP's dog Lucy, enjoy a walk in the temple gardens yesterday.
Sir David was one of about 1500 people who attended the centre's annual
open day. Entertainment provided during the day included Tibetan
traditional dancers, Indian folk dancing, and Irish folk music. Mr Thom
McCarthy, the centre's assistant administrator, said the event raised
almost #5000 for projects in Tibet. He said it was held in appreciation
of the local support and to update the local community on the movement's

SINN Fein president Gerry Adams yesterday assured thousands of
cheering supporters that the IRA had ''not gone away''.
He made the remark as he was addressing a tricolour-waving crowd
outside Belfast city hall, and it followed a weekend of violence in
Londonderry, Belfast and Armagh which had already shaken the peace
process.
Police believe IRA activists were involved in the violence and point
to the appearance of men wearing masks and hurling petrol bombs in
Londonderry.
Mr Adams had told a Republican rally that the decommissioning of IRA
weapons would not be acceptable as the precondition for all-party talks
on a political settlement.
When one of the spectators called out ''Bring back the IRA'', Mr Adams
replied, to wild applause: ''They haven't gone away, you know.''
The Northern Ireland Office said it had no comment to make.
The scenes of disorder, which continued yesterday afternoon in Belfast
before the Republican rally, were among the worst since before the IRA
and loyalist groups declared ceasefires almost a year ago.
The RUC defended its decision to allow marches of Protestant
Apprentice Boys to go ahead in Londonderry and South Belfast on Saturday
and police tactics during serious disorder involving Roman Catholic
protesters in both cities.
There were more confrontations and clashes yesterday when several
thousand Sinn Fein followers attended the annual anti-internment rally
from West Belfast to the city centre.
Minor skirmishes occurred along the route as loyalist youths taunted
the marchers and threw missiles. Once again police in riot gear broke up
the trouble, although there was no recurrence of the serious street
violence which took place on Saturday and led to injuries to 10
civilians and 12 police officers.
In a weekend of trouble, youths threw petrol bombs, set vehicles
alight and stoned firefighters.
In Armagh, crowds threw bottles and bricks at police and firefighters.
One fireman was injured, and police cars and several buses were damaged
In Belfast, a bus was hijacked and set alight by a man armed with a
handgun.
In Londonderry, crowds hurled petrol bombs and damaged shops. A crane
at a new shopping centre was set ablaze. Riot police forcibly removed
200 demonstrators from the city's walls overlooking the Catholic Bogside
area just before the start of a parade to mark the 306th anniversary of
the siege of Derry.
At Belfast City Hall, Mr Adams also attacked the British Government
for ''bolstering'' Unionist inflexibility and for failing to meet
demands for the release of prisoners and moving ahead with all-party
talks.
Mr Adams, addressing a crowd including visitors from Noraid in the US
and representatives of Basque and Catalan activists, dismissed the
Government's demand for the decommissioning of weapons.
''The struggle is not over, let no one be in any doubt about that,''
he warned. The fight would not end ''until the people of this island
have freedom, justice and peace''.
He said the British Government and Unionists were calling for the IRA
to disarm without any real expectation. ''Who do they think they are
kidding?'' Mr Adams asked.
Loud cheers rang out as he told the crowd: ''Let no-one tell you there
won't be Irish unity, there will.''
He pledged the British Government connection would be ''broken'', and
added: ''Making war is not difficult, making peace is, and in many ways
more difficult.''
There was nowhere for the British Government to go ''except home'',
and ''nowhere for the Unionists to go except negotiations''.
Mr Major could not dodge the issue, said Mr Adams. All-party talks
were the minimum demanded by the peace process.
''One thing is certain,'' he declared. ''Despite all that might
happen, despite injustice or setbacks, we are going to have freedom and
justice in our country.''
Mr Adams warned the crowd they were facing ''a very dangerous phase of
the struggle'', but said he had found that, throughout the world, their
campaign had ''found an echo everywhere''.
He concluded: ''We want to make peace with the British and we want to
make peace with the Unionists. It's now over to them.''
He also criticised Church leaders yesterday, saying they have failed
''miserably'' to act as peacemakers.
He said there had been a lot of good work done by individuals and some
top figures in terms of reaching out to their neighbours. ''But where
the Church leaders have failed so miserably is in facing up to
injustice, it's facing up to the reality of the situation. You know
'Blessed be the peacemaker', that's where they have failed,'' he told
the Sunday programme on BBC Radio 4.
''Perhaps at a human level there has been a lot of good work done, in
fact I know there has been a lot of good work done, but at a leadership
level we don't have a Bishop Tutu.''
The weekend's trouble has again raised political tensions in Ulster
and led to criticism from Catholic leaders and Sinn Fein about the RUC's
use of batons and plastic bullets.
Senior police officers have defended the force's action. The deputy
chief constable, Mr Ronnie Flanagan, said: ''I have no doubt there was
an orchestration of the violence, some of those injured and others
recognised by police at the scene were certainly not local people.''
SDLP leader John Hume said the disorder should bring even more urgency
to the quest for political agreement and he urged the Government to call
all the parties in Ulster to talks in September.
The Protestant Archbishop of Armagh, Dr Robin Eames, said he believed
progress required the decommissioning of weapons by the IRA and
loyalists.
With the anniversary of the IRA ceasefire now approaching on August
31, the Government is certain to come under intense pressure from
nationalist leaders in Ulster and the Irish Government to set a date for
all-party talks.
However, the weekend has driven Unionists and nationalists further
apart.

DR Katharine Morrison, the senior police surgeon representing Ayrshire
doctors who have been in dispute with Strathclyde Police over cuts in
pay for travel time, had cause for double celebration at the weekend.
Not only did Strathclyde Police announce that doctors would once again
be paid time to and from call outs, but Dr Morrison, who had been
co-ordinating the action in the last days of her pregnancy, gave birth
to a 6lb 10oz baby boy, David Alexander.
The decision by Strathclyde Police to reinstate the status quo came
just two weeks after the commencement of industrial action by the
Ayrshire doctors, and two weeks before proposed mass resignation which
would have taken place on September 1.
The police, who have apparently now found a way to commence paying the
doctors, have always argued it would not be possible to continue the
practice as it would mean that Strathclyde would be out of step with the
rest of the UK.
However, the weekend agreement will now remain in place until national
negotiations, which are not expected to take place for at least nine
months, resolve the issue permanently for police doctors throughout the
UK. The agreement was reached at a meeting with Glasgow police surgeons
at which the doctors had intended outlining proposed action to be taken
in the city.
Speaking from her hospital bed, Dr Morrison said: ''I have not yet
received notification in writing from Strathclyde but I believe that is
on its way.
''I am delighted with the decision. This is exactly the result that we
hoped for and, more importantly, it means that justice has been done. It
has been a difficult few weeks but we achieved exactly what we set out
to achieve and that was a return to the status quo.
''Sanctions will now stop and the service will immediately return to
normal. It was a complete coincidence that a settlement was reached on
the same day that my baby was born but it certainly gives cause for a
double celebration.''
Strathclyde Police were not available for comment.

Clare Henry meets Greta Scaachi, who portrayed Maria Cosway in a
Hollywood film, and discovers similarities between the star and Regent
painter turned educator.
''Maria was not just beautiful; she was a great woman, an
extraordinary woman!''
FILMSTAR Greta Scacchi is enthusiatic and -- knowlegable -- about the
real life Regency artist, musician, socialite and educator, Maria
Cosway, who she plays in a new film, Jefferson in Paris, and who,
together with Richard Cosway, is the subject of the Scottish National
Portrait Gallery's superb Festival exhibition.
''Maria's self-portrait pose: arms crossed, assertive, in control,
looking straight at the lens so to speak, inspired one of my key scenes;
also my costume. I wore a crucifix dangling on a black ribbon exactly as
in the picture. She was a very serious person, much more so than her
husband Richard. It's interesting to see an exhibition which shows their
different styles. Richard's portrait of her is idealised; romantic. It
presents her as soft, pliable, passive, like a gentle muse -- but in
fact she was very active, very determined.''
We are in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Scacchi has driven
up from London because she is keen to see the exhibition. ''Oh! They've
got that big picture of her from Lodi!'' she exclaims, grabbing my arm.
Scaachi is easy, friendly, tactile, and immediately at home. ''I went to
the Fondazione Cosway in Lodi, near Milan where she lived from 1810 till
her death in 1838 and sat in her study for a day. It contains a wealth
of material. It's rare that you play a character with that amount of
research material available.''
Scacchi has certainly done her homework, lapping up all the
documentation Stephen Lloyd, SNPG curator of the show and advisor to the
film, sent her.
The Cosway story is stranger than fiction: more fascinating than any
script-writer could invent. Ravishing Anglo-Italian artist viewed as
potential successor to famous painter Angelica Kauffmann, in 1781,
(family in financial straits), Maria marries ugly, bisexual miniature
painter favoured by the Prince Regent. Becomes friend of aristocracy and
the society hostess of London. Affair with Jefferson, (later US
President). Only child dies. Retires to Lodi to set up girls convent
school.
Was it perfect casting? Greta Scacchi is also Anglo-Italian, from
Lombardy, her father keen on the arts. She obviously empathises with
Maria. ''I could talk for a couple of days about how wonderful this
woman Maria is!'' So was she disappointed when she saw Maria's
sentimental pictures, so obviously less impressive, even second rate, in
relation to the large oils and exquisite miniatures of Richard?
Scacchi is quick to fly to Maria's defence. ''Oh, I don't think you
should compare them. Once they were married, Richard banned her from
exhibiting. She wasn't allowed to compete with him! She accepted it
without complaint -- although she did complain vociferously about his
promiscuity and his bisexuality. In the end they grew apart, but she was
very loyal. When he became ill she returned to look after him and sit at
his bedside for his last years. There was a strong bond.
''People wondered why she married him when she had so many proposals,
but he wasn't just rich, he was a great artist and collector. He had an
eye for beauty, her included!'' Scaachi says.
A man with immense ego, determined to claw his way up the social
ladder, Richard Cosway was also a notorious gossip, libertine and dandy
who dressed like a peacock. His ability to collect people as well as art
served him well.
Maria, a prodigy, was exhibiting regularly at the Royal Academy by the
age of 20. In 1778, aged 18, Maria was elected a member of Florence's
Academy. She was also taught by Wright of Derby and the sculptor Thomas
Banks, going to Rome where ''I had the opportunity of knowing all the
first living artists intimately: Batoni, Mengs, Maron and many English
artists. Fuseli with his extraordinary visions struck my fancy. My
father had a great taste and knowledge of the arts and sciences,
therefore in every way contrived to furnish my mind. Had Mr Cosway
permitted me to paint professionally, I should have made a better
painter, but left to myself by degrees, instead of improving, I lost
what I had brought from Italy of my studies''.
Scaachi believes he compensated for this through his promotion of
Maria as a powerful society figure at the epicentre of an extraordinary
international circle of friends (and lovers) who included not just
Jefferson, but the painter Jacques-Louis David, (who also fancied her),
Canova of Three Graces fame (Maria and Canova corresponded over a
plaster cast of her friend Cardinal Fesch), Sir Thomas Lawrence, the
architect Sir John Soane, General Paoli, (at one time thought to be the
father of her child) and members of the Bonaparte family -- who
facilitated her project to copy the key pictures in the Louvre and print
a catalogue.
Scacchi is less interested in Maria's demise as an artist than her
decision to turn Jefferson down. ''Amazing! She met him in Paris when he
was American Ambassador. He wrote her the most wonderful letters. Yet
when he asked her to go to him, she said, 'What about my husband?' ''
Jefferson's famous 1786 love letter to Maria, composed ''by my fire
side, solitary and sad'' as a dialogue between ''my head and my heart'',
is poignant. ''Having performed the last sad office of handing you into
your carriage and seen the wheels into motion, I turned on my heel and
walked, more dead than alive, to the door.''
After their affair, Trumbull, who acted as courier of their letters
between Paris and London, painted a miniature of Jefferson for Maria
which she kept all her life. The glamorous pair continued to correspond
for 39 years till his death.
Meanwhile Richard Cosway had cornered the market in miniatures, his
breathtakingly beautiful -- and flattering -- portraits of the Prince of
Wales, later George IV, his morganatic wife Mrs Fitzherbert, the Duke of
Clarence later William IV, Queen Charlotte, Warren Hastings, Capability
Brown, the Duchess of Devonshire (who Maria also painted), the Lord
Elgin, Charles James Fox, Duc d'Orleans, Earl of Hopetoun et al, making
him a star.
These bejewelled rococo images come to Edinburgh from around the
world; lent by the V&amp;A, the Metropolitan, Paul Mellon and the Queen.
When Maria had a daughter in 1890 ''she seemed just as surprised as
everyone else was,'' says Scacchi. ''But it devastated her. Maybe it was
postnatal depression; she was certainly deeply troubled. She left her
husband and new baby and went to Italy for two years, writing to
Richard, ''the child is my only wish and thought, and my fears only for
her religion''. When her daughter died aged six, she turned increasingly
to Catholicism, he to mysticism.
''Guilt played its part,'' thinks Scacchi. ''But she had great success
with her strategy for education. The school flourished till the 1970s.''
An unexpected conclusion to an extraordinary Regency life.
''It was so nice to meet you,'' says Scacchi. ''You too,'' I reply,
thinking, surely this should be the other way around? Did Maria have
Scacchi's unaffected kind of charisma? I guess so. As James Ivory said,
Scacchi as Maria is the perfect dream casting -- someone who adds a
touch of interpretive gold dust to an already fascinating figure.
* Richard and Maria Cosway: Regency Artists of Taste and Fashion is at
Edinburgh's Portait Gallery, Queen Street until October 22 when it
transfers to London's National Portrait Gallery.
People wondered why Maria married him but he wasn't just rich, he was
a great artist.
Guilt played its part, but she had great success with her strategy for
education

<HEADLINE>Railtrack memo warns of safety crisis</HEADLINE>

RAILTRACK will be unable to manage its safety procedures effectively
for at least 18 months and should take immediate advice from safety
professionals such as the UK Atomic Energy Authority or Lloyds Safety
Register, according to a leaked internal Railtrack memo.
In it, Mr Jack Rose, the safety assessment manager at Railtrack's
Major Projects Division at Waterloo warns the MPD's director, Mr Gil
Howarth, that a list of systems must be put in place to help solve what
he describes as ''a critical situation for MPD'' and also to allow
Railtrack to adequately defend itself in the event of an accident.
He refers to a number of incidents, and two in particular, which ''but
for the final link in the chain could have been another Clapham''.
''Recent incidents in Scotland, among other places, add to the above
list of near misses,'' he adds.
''Given all the above, any safety professional or manager responsible
for safety worth their salt would at this point be seriously considering
whether at some very short time in the future they really want to stand
in the dock following a major disaster,'' he said in the memo.
The Labour Party last night called upon the Government to abandon its
plans for the sell-off and flotation of Railtrack and demanded it
publish an emergency safety plan.
Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, claimed the reference
in the memo to ''standing in the dock'' was a clear warning to Transport
Secretary Sir George Young and potential investors that Railtrack was
not ready for privatisation.
In the memo, dated June 22, 1995, Mr Rose accepts that by setting up a
safety management system and incident/accident monitoring system,
Railtrack has made ''a first step in the right direction in the process
of risk management and reduction''. However, he also warns that this is
only one of a number of critical processes and will take many months
before it is effective.
He wrote: ''Were I to be carrying out a safety audit of MPD (and
similar questions are likely to be asked of you following a major
accident), among the questions that currently could not be answered and
relate to the missing safety and management processes and incidents that
have been occurring are as follows:
* Do you really know and understand how safe your staff are, to what
risks they are exposed, and how effective your managers are in ensuring
that safety?
* Do you have a system in place that ensures that all staff,
particularly senior managers, are required to have a full profiling
examination and go through a professional assessment to determine their
adequacy for their job rather than waiting for them to fail, as has been
happening all too frequently of late?
* Do you have a total quantified risk assessment in place for MPD so
that you are in a position to pro-actively manage your risks by being
able to predict them and identify the root causes that need to be
eliminated if safety is to be effectively managed?
''Even with all the systems in place to answer the above, considerable
experience from all areas of industry, particularly London Underground,
tells us that it will take at least 18 months to be in a position where
we can begin to effectively manage safety and it will also require an
adequate safety professional organisation to help manage those systems
with a reporting line and responsibility to the top of Railtrack's
organisation.
''We would also need those systems in place to adequately defend
ourselves following an accident,'' he added.
The memo by Mr Rose, who carried out the first total quantified risk
assessment for London Underground following the King's Cross fire,
appears to be in response to two incidents, one in March during track
relaying at Stratford, and another in June at Saltham.
''In either incident, if the train body had been of the older, wooden
based construction, the events could have led to the ripping away of the
side of the train with disastrous consequences. We cannot afford to be
'third time unlucky','' he warned.
Mr McLeish last night described the leaked memo as ''a devastating
insight into the chaos within Railtrack''.
''It paints a picture of an organisation desperately struggling to get
to grips with the very contentious issue of safety and not succeeding,''
he said.
Mr McLeish said the memo showed ''clear signs of panic especially in
relation to the decision to contact UKAEA and the Lloyds Safety
Register'', and ''compelling evidence of an organisation that is giving
much less of a priority to safety than should be the case at a time when
all their energies and resources seem to be focused on the sale''.
He said: ''Against that background, we are demanding that the
privatisation and the flotation of Railtrack be immediately abandoned.
It would now be irresponsible, dangerous, and reckless to proceed with
this. I believe that the politics of privatisation are being put in
front of the lives of the travelling public.''
Mr McLeish also demanded details of the Scottish ''near-misses''
referred to in the memo, saying he had seen references to the incidents
in other documents but no information about the risks posed to the
travelling public.
He added: ''Labour has always said privatisation puts safety at risk.
Now we have the proof. The disruption caused by the break-up of the rail
industry has not just led to a poorer standard of service reliability,
it has put everyone who travels or works on the railway at risk.''
The RMT's divisional organiser in Scotland, Mr Phil McGarry, said
that, during last year's signal workers' strike, his union had warned
that Railtrack managers were ''gambling with people's lives'' during the
dispute and acting as if they were ''playing with Hornby train sets''.
He added that, under the Rail Safety Critical Work Regulations,
Railtrack was responsible for licensing other rail operators.
''This begs the question: if they have not got their own safety
correct, how can they be in a position to issue licences to other
operators?'', he said.
No comment was available from Railtrack last night.

TWO golfers were mugged by three youths as they putted out on a green
during an afternoon round. It was the latest incident in a catalogue of
violent crime that has turned a round of golf at Caird Park Golf Club in
Dundee into a survival course.
In recent months the club members have had to suffer:
* The clubhouse burgled and fire-bombed.
* The vice-captain held at knife-point.
* Players regularly mugged for cash and clubs on the course.
* Lockers ransacked dozens of times.
* Joyriders dumping burned-out vehicles on the fairways.
* Greens dug-up and vandalised.
* Golfers having to dodge glue-sniffers and motor cyclists.
* Thieves who queue up to break into vehicles in the club car park.
The clubhouse has now become a fully-alarmed ''bunker'' but last night
members vowed to get tough with the thugs and to play on regardless.
Committee member Mr Danny McLean said: ''If any muggers come near me
they will get my golf club over their head.
''Enough is enough. You don't expect to get mugged while you're
playing a game of golf. But we will play on through adversity. Our
members are very determined and very keen -- they have to be.''
He added: ''We are thinking of starting a karate club or a shooting
range to see if that will help matters. Our vice-captain was treatened
with a knife when he remonstrated with a young hooligan. These incidents
are very traumatic for the people affected.''
Member Mr Jim Cuthill said: ''We have problems Nick Faldo just
couldn't imagine. The locker rooms have been raided and the clubhouse
has been burgled. Earlier this year, they even tried to burn it down and
used a hose-pipe to pour petrol into it. If anyone tries to rob me I'll
let them have it with my putter.''
Another member, Mr Ken Smith, revealed: ''The situation at the car
park is really bad. Cars are always being vandalised. Sometimes you see
the neds waiting when you arrive.''
The 250-acre parkland course, with 350 members, on the northern
fringes of Dundee, is surrounded by five housing schemes.
Dundee District Council, which owns the course, has increased security
and has employed a ranger to patrol the course on an all-terrain
vehicle.
However, a spokesman admitted: ''We are aware of the problems and we
want golfers to enjoy a game in a trouble free atmosphere. But, because
of the vast area involved, it's impossible for our ranger to be every
place at once.''
Mr Stewart Ross, a spokesman for Tayside Police, said: ''The louts who
interfere with the leisure activity of these players are to be condemned
for their mean-spirited criminal acts.
''When crimes are perpetrated against this club, its members and its
property, we make every effort to detect those responsible.''
Police are still seeking the three youths who mugged two players in
the latest incident at the club.

Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester, Usher Hall
A WEE bit of tussling went on in Edinburgh yesterday between two
concerts vying for the title of opening concert to the 1995 Edinburgh
Festival. Technically and chronologically, the BBC claimed the right, as
their Scottish music concert was held in the afternoon. Try telling that
to the packed house at the Usher Hall last night where, in terms of
occasion (to say nothing of impact), the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra
probably won on points.
What a brilliant orchestra this is -- another of conductor Claudio
Abbado's richly imaginative institutions. Originally formed of
youngsters -- the average age looks to be mid-twenties -- from
non-European countries, the GMYO has broadened its base in the nine
years of its existence. Technically, as Abbado himself has acknowledged,
they are extraordinary.
If there was one characteristic that stamped their playing repeatedly
in their epic performances last night of Bruckner's Ninth Symphony and
Te Deum, it was virility. They bite and lean into music in a way that
you do not always hear from seasoned professional bands, almost as
though they want to bare their teeth and flex their muscles. And it was
a characteristic that I suspect Abbado exploited in a version of
Bruckner's last symphony that was refreshingly free of incense and
saccharine on the one hand, and the typical monolithic blocks of sound
on the other.
Rather than accumulate the composer's granite slabs, layering them
with musical mortar until they assemble into the familiar massive
pillars, Abbado used the raw thrill and burnished sound of the young
orchestra to draw great streams of intense lyricism. This version of the
symphony was more to do with colour and flow than with architecture. It
made for a different kind of drama -- though the immense climaxes were
equally shattering.
The playing was bracing, to say the least. There are a few
discrepancies in the woodwind playing (almost like a clash of national
styles), but the clarity and virtuosity of string playing was
mind-blowing: the fierce, youthful aggression of their attack in the
second movement was almost scary while, in the more relaxed section of
the same movement, they were downright racy and impudent.
Perhaps not a version for those who worship at the shrine where
Bruckner is the cardinal of devotional symphonic music -- far too
earthbound for that. For the rest of us, however, who are agnostics with
this sort of music, it was a refreshingly down-to-earth, feet-on-the
ground, humanist version of a great symphony, played with a rare and
robust fire in its belly.
Ironically, the same approach worked less well in the Te Deum, where
the sonorous Edinburgh Festival Chorus would have been put to better use
by building a rock-solid cathedral of sound, rather than a temple of
expressivity. Distinguished soloists made notable contributions,
particularly the fabulous soprano Jane Eaglen and German tenor Endrik
Wottrich.

THE director of Scotland's largest lone parent organisation last night
described controversial proposals by defeated Tory leadership challenger
John Redwood for teenage single mothers to put their babies up for
adoption as ''outrageous'' and ''a lurch back to Victorian values''.
Mr John Findlay of the Strathclyde-based One Plus, which represents
114 single parent groups in the West of Scotland, launched his attack
after the right-wing MP expressed the view that adoption should be
considered if the father or grandparents could not support the mother or
baby.
Mr Redwood wrote in the Mail on Sunday: ''If no-one in the family can
help, maybe a girl should consider letting a couple adopt her child to
provide the home the baby needs.''
The former Welsh Secretary also warned that young women with
illegitimate children were jumping the housing queue, and called for the
system to give more encouragement to the two-parent family.
However, in a stinging attack, Mr Findlay said: ''Mr Redwood's
proposals are outrageous and a further confirmation of the lurch back to
Victorian values pursued by the Tory Party.
''Thank God he did not become Prime Minister. One wonders if his
comments are a reflection of Tory party thinking in general. If they are
it is a warning to us all.''
Mr Redwood ran his unsuccessful campaign for the party leadership
based on demands for cuts in public spending.
In his article he warned that benefits to single mothers now cost
almost #10bn a year, equivalent to 4p on the standard rate of income
tax. He stressed that the welfare state should be a last resort for
young single mothers and they should be placed in hostels rather than
given a council house.
He stressed he was not writing about single mothers who were widows or
divorcees.
Mr Redwood caused a storm when, as Welsh Secretary, he made similar
remarks about single mothers.

<HEADLINE>Labour attacks hand-out 'scandal.'   Ministers claim EU cash subsidies for their farms.</HEADLINE>

LABOUR yesterday attacked the ''scandal'' of Ministers who own large
farms receiving European hand-outs of more than #100,000.
Shadow Agriculture Minister Gavin Strang said Labour opposed all
set-aside subsidies paid to farmers not to grow food.
''These tax hand-outs are a scandal. Why should the taxpayer be paying
out such colossal sums of money to large farmers?'' he said.
Dr Strang's criticism followed a report in yesterday's Sunday Times
claiming that several Ministers were receiving grants from Brussels in
excess of #100,000.
Some Ministers had even opposed the subsidy system but had accepted
the cash hand-outs for their farms.
They can claim a range of subsidies for their crops, setting aside
land, taking measures to protect the environment, such as planting
forests, or to cover them if the price of sheep or cattle falls below
the EU price.
Following an investigation, the newspaper alleged that:
* Lord Inglewood, a Minister at the Department of National Heritage,
would receive #130,000 in grants this year.
* Earl Ferrers, the Environment Minister, would receive #140,000.
* Earl Howe, a Defence Minister, had admitted gaining #85,000 in crop
subsidies this year.
* Other Ministers who have successfully claimed tens of thousands of
pounds are listed as Junior Agriculture Minister Timothy Boswell,
Foreign Office Minister Sir Nicholas Bonsor, and Treasury Minister David
Heathcoat-Amory.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food said:
''They are making these claims as they would if they were perfectly
private individuals.''
Under set-aside, farmers receive arable payments if they agree not to
grow food on a certain percentage of their land -- currently some 12%.
The spokesman said set-aside had been only a temporary measure and the
Government and farmers themselves were keen to find other ways of using
the land.
''Set-aside was brought in as an interim measure to try to reduce the
levels of surplus stocks. It has worked in that sense. The food
mountains are now almost like molehills,'' the spokesman said.
But Dr Strang criticised former Agriculture Minister John Gummer, who
represents a Suffolk farming seat, for leading a successful fight
against an original plan to put a cap on the amount large farms could
claim.
He also attacked another former Agriculture Minister, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, who represents a Norfolk farming seat, for securing additional
set-aside payments.
''She was described in the Council of Agriculture Ministers as the
voice of the Norfolk barley barons,'' Dr Strang said.
''Instead of fighting for open ended set-aside and arable payments to
farmers, Conservative Ministers should have been holding out for
fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which is costing
taxpayers and consumers in this country thousands of millions of
pounds.''

A SURGEON, who performed mid-air life-saving surgery on a Scots woman
aboard a jumbo jet using a coathanger, yesterday pledged to give a
#30,000 award made in recognition of his extraordinary feat to a medical
school.
Mrs Pauline Dixon, 39, of Torry, Aberdeen, was within 10 minutes of
death with a collapsed lung on board a flight from Hong Kong in May when
her life was saved by the emergency operation performed with makeshift
apparatus, including a coathanger sterilised with brandy.
Professor Angus Wallace, head of the orthopaedic department at Queen's
Medical Centre in Nottingham, said he would hand over the cash to the
Nottingham University Medical School for research.
He will receive the international award for exemplary medical care
from Baroness Thatcher later this year.
Professor Wallace said yesterday: ''When I was told over the phone
that I had won the award I accepted without realising that $50,000 went
with it.''
The award, understood to be from an American philanthropist, is in
recognition of the makeshift operation he carried out at 35,000ft on a
British Airways flight from Hong Kong to Heathrow when Mrs Dixon passed
out with chest pains.
After diagnosing a collapsed lung, shortly after the plane had taken
off, he inserted a straightened coathanger into a catheter and
sterilised it with brandy before draining Mrs Dixon's lung into a bottle
of mineral water.
Mrs Dixon recovered and was chatting to him by the time the plane
landed.
''A lot of people seem to have got a great deal of pleasure out of
what I did on the plane,'' Professor Wallace said. ''I must confess that
I myself had a very stressful flight but I was impressed by how much it
pleased other people.''
Professor Wallace was assisted by Dr Tom Wong, a senior house officer
at Stracathro Hospital, near Brechin.
Mrs Dixon had been returning home from a 10-day trip to Hong Kong
where she was visiting her sister, Kathleen.
She had been involved in a motorcycle crash during her holiday and
suffered a collapsed lung 20 minutes after the flight to Heathrow took
off.
Mrs Dixon could not be contacted for comment yesterday.

<HEADLINE>Carling's wife criticises the Princess</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976896183</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Princess of Wales was handed a stinging rebuke from Will Carling's
wife yesterday over her close friendship with the England rugby captain.
Mrs Julia Carling insisted her year-old marriage remained firmly
intact despite the strain of the disclosure that her husband had struck
up a relationship with the Princess.
In a pointed criticism of the Princess, she said: ''This has happened
to her before and you hope she won't do these things again, but she
obviously does.
''She picked the wrong couple to do it with this time because we can
only get stronger from it.''
Mrs Carling, 30, who runs her own public relations company, told the
Mail on Sunday newspaper that her first reaction to allegations about
her husband last weekend had been ''complete disbelief''.
She added: ''But the truth that this was no more than a friendship was
something that Will dealt with very quickly.''
For his part, Carling, 29, admitted: ''I made a mistake.'' He said he
had been naively flattered by the attention paid to him by the Princess.
''My main feelings are about what it has done to people around me, the
people I really care about and love, Julia, what it has done to her.
That is unforgiveable,'' he said.
Carling dismissed as ''utter rubbish'' claims made by his former
secretary, Ms Hilary Ryan, that he ran after the Princess like a puppy,
and said he had not installed a special hot line to take the Princess's
calls, nor had they swapped the pet names of Boss or Captain.
''I have spoken to the Princess since all this came out. She is sad
about it and says it has happened to her time and time again.
''But it hasn't happened to us before, and I never ever want it to
happen to us again,'' he said.
Friendships with the Princess of Wales have thrust a number of men,
including Mr Oliver Hoare, Major James Hewitt, and Mr James Gilbey, into
the media spotlight.
Mr Hoare's wife did not speak out and Lady Alethea Savile, a former
lover of Mr Gilbey, who later killed herself, confessed she had never
come to terms with his ''passion'' for the Princess.
However, Mrs Carling is making clear that she intends to use her
experience in dealing with the media to put her message across.
She is an experienced PR woman who knows how to deal with the press
and has carefully stage-managed her public appearances over the past
week, even drawing comparisons between herself and the Princess, such as
calling her husband captain -- the Princess's alleged nickname for him
-- within earshot of reporters.
She is used to the press. Before her marriage she attracted attention
when she dropped out of university to live with the millionaire former
Yardbirds guitarist Jeff Beck and also dated the rock star Eric Clapton.
With her brother Adrian, she runs PR agency Hands On, and has gained
invaluable experience in handling the demands of the media from
representing Clapton, Mick Jagger, and Right Said Fred.
Recently, she used these skills and industry contacts to turn herself
into a media personality with appearances on music channel VH-1 and on
Channel 4's The Big Breakfast show.
The Princess was said to be dismayed by reports that her relationship
with Carling was anything other than innocent, according to the News of
the World. A friend of the Princess told the newspaper she was
''extremely anxious'' to end the speculation.
There was further embarrassment for the Carlings yesterday, after the
People published alleged extracts from intimate letters written by the
rugby star to a former girlfriend.
The letters to Ms Victoria Taylor-Jackson are said to date from a tour
of Australia in 1991. The couple split up two years ago.

PRINCE Edward's girlfriend, Miss Sophie Rhys-Jones, kept a low profile
yesterday when she joined the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on a visit
to the Queen Mother at the Castle of Mey in Caithness.
Dressed in an ankle-length cream dress, she slipped away almost
unnoticed as the Queen Mother chatted with members of her family at the
quayside at Scrabster after Britannia cast anchor in Thurso Bay.
Crowds thronged the port to see the royal guests arrive. Shortly
before a launch took the visitors to the harbour, the Queen Mother
arrived at the quayside. She had a pronounced limp as she walked from
the Range Rover with the aid of a stick.
There was speculation last week that the sweethearts were soon to be
engaged when Miss Rhys-Jones joined the royal family for its annual
Western Isles cruise.
But royal insiders said the Scottish cruise in the royal yacht should
not be seen as signalling anything more than the couple's continuing
strong relationship.
The Queen delighted the crowd by going on a small walkabout along the
quay. Among the posies she accepted was one from five-year-old Andrew
McArter, who is on holiday with his grandmother, Mrs Marie Grant. The
Belfast pair are staying with relatives in Thurso.
The day was also memorable for 12-year-old Kerry Sutherland, of
Halkirk, near Thurso, who also presented the Queen with flowers.
She said: ''The Queen said the flowers were very nice. She asked if I
picked them from my garden and I said I did.''
After lunch at Mey, the visiting royals made their way back to
Scrabster to begin the last leg of their cruise.

<HEADLINE>Corpse carries deadline warning. Rebels behead hostage held with Britons</HEADLINE>

THERE were growing fears for the lives of two Britons held hostage
last night after Kashmiri terrorists beheaded one of their captive
colleagues.
The Al-Faran rebels carved their group's signature on the corpse and
dumped it in a road with a threat to kill the others.
The headless corpse of Norwegian Hans Ostroe was found with a note
threatening that his kidnappers would kill the four remaining Western
hostages if their demands were not met within two days.
''Indian dogs, if you do not fulfil our demands, the others will
suffer the same fate,'' the note said.
The Indian Government was considering an armed rescue operation to
free the hostages, who include Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells.
The Norwegian's head and body were found dumped about 20 metres apart
near the town of Anantnag, 35 miles from the Kashmiri capital, Srinagar.
The discovery was made by a peasant woman collecting firewood.
Mr Mangan's mother Mavis, 60, at the family's Middlesbrough home,
said: ''It's been hell. People just don't understand what we've been
through.''
The Foreign Office denounced Mr Ostroe's murder as ''barbaric'' and
said it heightened concern for the two Britons.
A spokesman said: ''We are redoubling our efforts with the Indian
authorities and others to try to bring about an early and safe release
of the remaining hostages.
''We have much sympathy for Mr Ostroe's family and for those others
affected by this tragic development. The responsibility for this
barbaric act of violence rests with the perpetrators Al-Faran, and
no-one else.''
Mr Mangan, 34, an electrical contractor, and Mr Wells, 23, of
Blackburn, were kidnapped while trekking in the Himalayas on July 4. Mr
Mangan's wife Julie, 33, was also captured, but released soon
afterwards.
Their kidnappers, fighting for Kashmir's independence from India, are
demanding the release of 15 militants from Indian jails.
It was not clear if the Indian authorities knew precisely where
Al-Faran was holding its hostages in Kashmir.
''We have a general idea of the place where these people are holed
up,'' said an official. ''We have maintained a kind of surveillance and
Al-Faran has been getting in touch with us from time to time.''
A telephone caller who said he was speaking for Al-Faran told the
Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency that the group killed Mr Ostroe
because its demands were ignored.
Envoys of Britain, Germany, Norway, and the US were last night called
to a meeting with the Indian Home Secretary to discuss possible action.
Norway's Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal said: ''Norway strongly
condemns this gruesome and meaningless act of terror against an innocent
Norwegian citizen. We demand that those behind it be held responsible.''
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel condemned the killing, and said
in a statement that the hostage-takers should ''not add another crime to
their inhuman act''.
The US called for the release of the captives, including American
Donald Hutchings, 42. The fifth hostage is German Dirk Hasert, 26.
Meanwhile, established Kashmiri militants in Pakistan were distancing
themselves from the previously unknown Al-Faran group, blaming the
killing on Indian Government ''dirty tricks''.
Mr Amanullah Khan, chairman of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front,
said: ''It is a heinous act. We condemn it with all force at our
command. No conscientious Kashmiri can do it.'' He said Al-Faran
appeared to be acting at the behest of Indian authorities to damage the
freedom struggle.
A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman said: ''It is clear that the
inhuman kidnapping and the ghastly murder are the acts of forces that
are seeking to discredit the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people
and to damage their cause.
''The government of Pakistan urges the unconditional and immediate
release of the remaining hostages.''
