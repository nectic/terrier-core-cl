A WOOL and clothing salesman -- whose area was the whole of Scotland
apart from a vague area 30 to 40 miles around Glasgow -- has won his
claim for unfair dismissal
For a ''heartless'' English company sacked him because the costs of
employing him outweighed his sales.
But an Industrial Tribunal said the arrangement excluded John
Marshall, of Knights Way, Stoneywood, Denny, Stirlingshire, from the
most densely populated part of the country.
And it found he was unfairly sacked by Roland Burgess Ltd., of
Newcastle, as their Scottish sales rep for hand-knitting wools and
ladies and kids clothing.
He was given notice and redundancy pay on January 3, 1995, but
complained to the Tribunal that there was no redundancy situation as TWO
new sales staff were employed to cover the area.
Mr Marshall also argued his selection for redundancy was unfair, there
was no intimation his job was in jeopardy, he had no consultation, and
wasn't offered one of the new posts.
The tribunal ruled: ''The manner of his dismissal, by a letter sent to
him by post, was heartless and fell far short of what would be expected
from a reasonable employer.''
Mr Marshall was awarded #7665.

A JOYRIDER -- aged 27 -- took a spin in her own father's car while
under the influence of drugs.
And Lesley Gilligan failed to stop after being involved in a crash.
But Glasgow District Court heard that Gilligan was recognised by the
other driver.
Her father told police she had taken the car without permission and
was not insured.
Gilligan, now living in London, admitted taking the car without
permission from Glenhead Street, Possilpark, driving without insurance
and failing to stop after an accident on December 17 last year.
An agent said that Gilligan had taken temazapam and had simply
panicked after the accident. She was now drug free.
Gilligan was fined #400 and banned from driving for one year.

MUMS may find it tough juggling home, family and career. But as far as
creature comforts go, there has never been a better time to be a baby.
While working mothers are short of time, their earning power means
that most babies want for nothing.
As a result, babies are having more money spent on them than ever
before.
According to the latest survey from Heinz, the average baby works its
way through 6000 nappies, worth a grand total of #1000, before it is
potty trained. And despite the fact that the birth rate is falling,
sales of both disposable nappies are actually continuing to grow.
Also gaining in popularity are disposable trainer pants. And there has
been an explosion in the sales of baby wipes with new, more expensive
cloth wipes, making a big impact.
But according to Claire Lyons from Bishopbriggs, many of the products
on the market are nice to have but not actually necessary for bringing
up baby.
Claire who has two boys, Paul (4) and Mark (1[1/2]), says that when
she had her first baby she bought every baby product on the market.
''With your first baby you do it by the book and I still meet mums in
the changing rooms who have bought the lot.''
But by the time her second baby came along she realised that, apart
from the basics, most of the stuff clogging up the medicine cupboard and
bathroom shelves was not vital.
Claire said: ''I really feel that the manufacturers who come up with
new products are praying on the guilt of busy mums.''

Top of the survey was Bob Hoskins for the British Telecom advert.

SCOTS trade unionists today fired a warning shot at Labour leader Tony
Blair over low pay.
They demanded Labour meets its pledge to bring in a national minimum
wage if it wins the next General Election.
The plea came at the launch of a new report on low pay from the STUC
and the Scottish Low Pay Unit.
The report - Minimum Wages: Dispelling the Myths - calls for a low
wage floor to be set at half the average male earning before eventually
rising to two-thirds.
At current prices, that means the new minimum wage will be set at
#4.15 an hour.
Trade unionists confirmed the report is aimed at pressurising Labour
bosses not to backslide on their commitment.
Mr Blair has repeatedly refused to commit himself to a set rate or
formula.
Today STUC assistant general secretary Bill Speirs said: ''We are very
anxious to put the strongest possible case to Labour that it should
stand by its existing policy of introducing a minimum wage formula.''
A spokeswoman in Mr Blair's office said: ''It's a matter of addressing
the problem of low pay but making sure it doesn't have an adverse affect
on jobs.''

She was preparing to star alongside Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder

But a spokesperson says: ''It is definitely not true that Emma is
pregnant.
''She pulled out of the film because she wants some time. She has so

ONLY the Tories could find a way to make crime pay.
Their latest plan is to charge jobhunters a fiver a time for their
criminal records.
EVEN IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT ONE.
Under a White Paper to be revealed in the autumn, more employers will
be allowed access to criminal records.
Employers denied direct access would be entitled to insist applicants
provide a 'criminal conviction certificate'.
One argument is that it will protect children, yet most childcare
employers already have access.
So why push ahead with such a daft and dangerous scheme?
TO LET THE TORIES PRIVATISE CRIMINAL RECORDS AND HAND THEIR CITY PALS
A PROFIT.
Minor offences long buried in the past will be dredged up.
More serious ones will be flung in the faces of people who have paid
their dues.
If this crazy plan goes ahead, no offender can ever be rehabilitated.

IT looks as if the sun was the only thing that had its hat on
recently.
Adults and children were seen looking like boiled lobsters in just
about every surgery and casualty up and down the country.
Is it lack of information that makes people rush out and sunbathe for
hours on end with a splash of sun cream on behind each ear?
I don't think so somehow. It's either some sort of masochism or summer
madness that does it, but it has crossed my mind that people don't buy
decent sun cream because it's expensive.
Certainly some can set you back six or seven quid. However I can
honestly say that after shopping around I have always managed to get it
much cheaper than that.
Now I figure if adults want to fry, they can accept the consequences
of pain, swelling and the increased risk of skin cancer.
But children don't deserve to suffer the pain and blistering from
overexposure to the sun whether it is Scottish or Mediterranean. Sun
burn in childhood has been shown to increase the risk of skin cancer.
And you don't need to mortgage the house to protect them either. A
floppy hat, a baggy T-shirt to cover shoulders and tops of legs and some
sun block should do the trick.
If you're off on holiday then it's also useful to take some antiseptic
cream for cuts, some paracetamol in case they get a high temperature,
some lacto-calamine which won't make them look like the pink panther and
will soothe any stings or, god forbid, sun burn that they get.
The usual household plasters should also be taken and some fluid
replacement sachets which are handy if they get diarrhoea.
And when you get to your resort whether it's Spain or Saltcoats, find
out where the nearest doctor is and get the telephone number.

THERE is nothing new in Scottish further education colleges accessing
European Social/Regional Development Funds.
But the Glasgow College of Nautical Studies may be unique in that the
person they have employed to co-ordinate this effort is a European
herself.
Anne Robin Doherty arrived in Scotland from her native France in 1985
as an exchange teacher and then returned to Glasgow in 1988 to marry.
Until recently she has worked with Paisley &amp; Renfrewshire Trust and
has been now been employed specifically by the College of Nautical
Studies to access European funding.
She will work with Fiona Cherry, who is head of Cross College Services
and in charge of the whole European dimension.
''We felt the need to bring it all together because it was less
efficient before with me doing the job with one hand while running my
department with the other,'' Anne said.
''So one person was appointed to take it forward as a sole task.''
This move to build relationships and form partnerships with member
states is likely to result in increased job opportunities for students
at the college, and potential markets are being investigated.
Two weeks ago, the college played host to a delegation from Kotka
Polytechnic in Finland, which has its own Maritime Department and is
interested in fostering links with other European bodies that run
courses in Maritime Studies.
Glasgow College of Nautical Studies had already recognised this niche
marketplace and is keen to promote its courses in Europe.
It is one of the only places in the UK to run a Masters Certificate,
and was of interest to the Finnish visitors.
''The Finnish students are expected to come on the Masters course and
there will be further dialogue about our students utilising their
training ship,'' said Anne.
''There is also an idea of incorporating marketing in our courses, and
they have an HND in Marketing which, like most of their courses, is run
in English.''
And as Fiona explained: ''While Maritime Studies is our niche market,
it is not the only market.
''We have the School of Sport and Leisure, for example, and have led
the field in our HND in Sports Coaching development.''
Anne and Fiona are hoping that this first, exploratory visit by the
Finns will be reciprocated in the near future and envisage a growing
partnership with them.

THE Monklands saga looks to be about as long running as Coronation
Street. The inquiry announced by Ian Lang into staffing will take some
time.
The staffing figures are interesting. If the average person in
Monklands had as many relatives employed by the council as the average
councillor, Monklands would be employing well over 300,000.
Makes one think. Not that there is necessarily anything wrong in the
relatives of councillors being employed by a council. But the scale of
it in Monklands raises questions, to put it mildly.
What is surprising about the reaction of Monklands to Professor
Black's report is that they commissioned it. Now they reject it
completely.
As for the future, Monklands District Council, like all other existing
councils, will no longer exist from next year. The people of Monklands
will be citizens of a new council - North Lanarkshire. A much needed
fresh start.

PARTICK THISTLE'S Inter-Toto Cup hero Tom Smith has told the club:
Stump up and I'll stay!
The 21-year-old midfielder, whose two goals dumped Keflavik at the
weekend, will meet John Lambie this week to try and thrash out a new
deal.
Smith is out of contract and only played against the Icelandic side
because he signed on for an extra month - now he wants his Firhill
future sorted out.
''I will be meeting the manager in the next few days,'' said Tom,
''but I need to wait and see if I'm offered a decent contract.
''I'd love to stay at Thistle because I enjoy playing here. My
contract finished on May 31 and I signed on for another month so I could
play in the Inter-Toto.''
Smith missed Thistle's draw in Austria with Linzer last week because
he was on holiday. Under UEFA rules he will have to sit out the clash
with French side Metz on Saturday unless he agrees to a new contract.

MANY people are willing to turn their hands to a variety of different
work - and that means that they often find themselves in unusual
interview situations.
While most of these will be straightforward, there is always the
possibility of 'rogue' situations arising with unscrupulous - or indeed
bogus - employers.
It is important to be vigilant in all instances and it is worth taking
on board the advice of the Employment Service when going for an
interview.
* Tell a friend or relative where you are going and when you will
return
* If the interview takes place after working hours, arrange for
someone to collect you
* Get as much background information on the company as possible before
you go
* Make sure your interview is at the employer's premises or in a
public place. Don't agree to meet in a location that you don't feel safe
in
* Don't agree to continue the interview over drinks or a meal
* Don't let the interviewer steer the interview towards personal
subjects unrelated to the job
* Don't accept a lift home from the interviewer.

and is now the Marquess of Bute, is offering land to Ayrshire and Arran
Community Health Trust to build a community hospital for East Ayrshire.
However, South Ayrshire Hospitals Trust wants the facility to be built
on a site at its own Ballochmyle Hospital near Mauchline.
The Community Trust is backing a consortium of Cumnock GPs who have
planned for the hospital to include a 24-bed medium acute unit at the
10-acre greenfield site Johnny Dumfries is offering in Cumnock.
Ayrshire and Arran Health Board has put the matter out to consultation
and is considering the views of both health trusts, local people, and
district councillors.
Community Trust chiefs feel Ballochmyle would be the wrong site for
the hospital to serve the health problems faced by East Ayrshire's
30,000 population.
Its vice-chairman Scott McConnell said: ''Now that we have obtained a
site the credibility of our case must now stand even higher with the
local population.
''We will now present our case to the Ayrshire and Arran Health Board
in the next few days, not as part of the battle between trusts, but as
an option based on good value for money for everyone concerned.''

SECURITY is to be stepped up at an Ayrshire railway station, where a
young woman was murdered.
Closed circuit cameras are to be installed along with more effective
lighting at the unmanned West Kilbride station.
It was in a bothy at the station that the body of 27-year-old murder
victim Yvette Wilson, (pictured left), was found in January. Her killer
Edward Mullen, (25), was later jailed for life.
Now the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive has unveiled
measures to make the station safer and more attractive.
And they were today welcomed by Cunninghame North MP Brian Wilson as
''very solid progress''.
While Mr Wilson said that he would still prefer to see all stations
manned he added: ''In the present economic climate the cameras are a
very useful step forward.''
The station car park is to be resurfaced and new seating provided on
the platform.

SCOTS rail commuters face summer holiday strike chaos.
Train drivers are thought to have backed a series of 24-hour stoppages
in a bid to win a better pay deal.
And the summer of discontent which is likely to bring Scotland's rail
network to a standstill could begin next week at the start of the
Glasgow Fair.
A strike ballot involving 12,000 thousand drivers with the Associated
Society of Locomotove Engineers and Firemen ended at noon today.
And Aslef sources predicted ''a significant majority'' wanted the
stoppages to try to force rail chiefs to improve a ''final offer'' pay
rise of three per cent.
Profit
Union officials will meet later today to be officially informed of the
strike ballot result.
If strike action is planned, unions must give BR 10 days notice before
the walk-outs.
Meanwhile, British Rail is set to announce bumper profits later this
week - its last financial year before privatisation.
Rail Maritime and Transport union members at BR are also voting on
one-day strikes over pay.
RMT general secretary Jimmy Knapp said: ''The expected profit
justifies the arguments we made during the pay negotiations that BR can
afford more and that the workforce deserve a better offer than three per
cent.''

A WORKER who punched a former works manager and his foreman at a
Christmas ''do'' has lost his unfair dismissal case.
An Industrial Tribunal heard the sacked employee thought the men, one
of whom was his brother-in-law, had kicked a stool he was dancing on.
John Moffat, of Inverurie Street, Springburn, Glasgow, was employed as
a yardman for 16 years by Clydeside Galvanisers, Yorkhill, Glasgow,
until he was sacked on December 20 last year.
Employees of the zinc galvanisers had been having a festive night out.
The Tribunal noted: ''The applicant was one of those dancing on a
stool and whilst doing so, considered that the stool had been kicked.
''He decided that the perpetrator was Mr Colin Turnbull - the ex works
manager and the applicant struck Mr Turnbull in the face.''
When Mr Moffat claimed Mr Turnbull had kicked the stool, his
brother-in-law Duncan Neilson said that it wasn't the ex works manager
but himself.
At this the yardman punched his brother-in-law on the mouth.
The tribunal verdict was: ''In our view the applicant's conduct
deserved dismissal.''

SCOTS business chiefs have voted against a single European currency.
Research carried out by the Forum of Private Business shows that 44.9
per cent of those polled oppose the move.
The survey shows that 31.4 per cent were undecided when asked if they
favoured a common currency in Europe.
And only 23.7 per cent were in favour of a common European currency.
A big majority - 65.2 per cent - would support a proposal for a
referendum on Europe.
Only 20 per cent of Scots businesses are opposed to the idea of a
European referendum.
Stan Mendham, head of FPB, said: ''The private business community is
saying that the politicians are pushing them further than they want to
go.
''Falling support for a single currency suggests that many business
owners fear this would signal the ceding to Europe to key areas such as
taxtion and employment issues.''
The survey shows that overall 71 per cent of members are against
speeding up the process towards a federal Europe.

THE name's Dunphy. James Dunphy.
I was bored with life so I decided to become a private eye. It kinda
appealed to me.
I got some funny looks at first because I'm only 11.
It ain't every day you see a primary school kid tracking down
unfaithful husbands and the like.
Still, they say size don't matter.
So how did I become an Honorary Investigator with a framed certificate
to prove it?
The kids in my class at Wallacestone Primary in Falkirk were
discussing what they wanted to do. Some said doctors. Some said train
drivers. Guess who piped up and said private eye.
I wrote to this Glasgow company, City Investigations in Ingram Street,
asking for tips. They gave me the 4.15 at Ayr. I told them I was
serious.
So they hauled me in and told me to stick in at school.
They've even promised me an interview when I'm 18.
And hey - guess the name of the guy who's taken me in hand here?His
name's Marlow. Not Philip, though. Ian.
But with someone with that surname looking out for me, a budding tec
can't go far wrong!

* WE often tend to ignore events abroad which can affect our lives.
We all know about the recent European Summit. But there has been much
less attention on the American Japanese trade talks.
Yet these are of great importance to us. Japan is an enormous market.
It is not easy to penetrate - not only because of official barriers but
because the whole selling system is very inward looking.
Yes there are tax problems but it is more complex than that.
The Americans are mostly concerned about trade in cars. But if they
generally open up the Japanese market, that has to be good news for us.
Not that we completely fail at the moment in Japan. We have lots of
successful exports, mainly at the quality end of the market.
But we could do with a bigger share of such a large and prosperous
market.

A RECENT conference heralded the return of apprenticeships in
Scotland.
The Scottish Modern Apprenticeships Seminar was attended by training
representatives from the LECs, Scottish Enterprise and Industrial
Training Organisations.
The modern apprenticeships envisaged had been endorsed in a
consultation document from the Secretary of State, and will be delivered
through the Skillseekers training initiative.
Areas like engineering, chemicals, plumbing and information technology
are included and all have been identified as areas of need within the
Scottish economy.
John Cunningham, director of training at Lanarkshire Development
Agency said: ''This new initiative will ensure young people are educated
and trained to a high level to undertake careers in a wide range of
occupations.
''It is vital that we gather the views of industry throughout Scotland
to establish the best way forward.''
The new apprenticeships differ from the original ones in that the
training is not time-served but competency-based.
The young people involved will be employed from the start of training
and that training will be to Scottish Vocational Qualification (SVQ)
Level 3 or above.
The expectation is that in any of these industries, the apprentice
will be paid the rate for the job and, while this is not mandatory, the
Group would ask questions where it is not the case.
Mr Cunningham continued:''The vast majority will be employed
apprentices receiving the rate for the job.
''We believe that modern aprentices have a valuable role to play in
the future of scottish industry.
And he added:''It will not only mean that we have a highly trained
workforce, but young people will be given the chance to gain invaluable
experience on the job training within full-time employment.''

LOCAL phone calls could soon be free under proposals drawn up by BT to
halt the drift of customers to its rivals.
The idea, already popular in the United States, is among a series put
to industry watchdog Oftel.
Subscribers opting for free calls, which currently cost 1p per minute
at off-peak times, would pay a higher rental charge - as they do in the
U.S.
BT is losing around 50,000 customers a month, mainly to new cable
companies which offer a combined phone and television service.
The company submitted its plans to Oftel in the spring and a ruling is
due this month.

DRINK-UP while you can afford it - because the price of your pint is
going up faster than the rate of inflation.
Beer drinkers have always suspected it and now it is official says
Camra, the Campaign for Real Ale.
In Scotland a pint of beer is amongst the highest in Britain.
The survey shows real ale in Edinburgh is generally more expensive
than London.
But Paul Waterson, President of the Scottish License Trade Association
defended the prices.
He said: ''Brewers are putting the prices up while publicans are
trying to keep them down. It is making life very difficult.''

COSMETICS giant Estee Lauder has thrown its support behind
''terrific'' Liz Hurley.
Backing for the model and actress came amid her continuing agony over
boyfriend Hugh Grant's arrest with a prostitute in Los Angeles' Sunset
Boulevard.
Company president Leonard Lauder said: ''Elizabeth Hurley's contract
with Estee Lauder remains unchanged.
''We stand by any decision Elizabeth makes in her personal life and
have not offered her any advice.
''We are supportive of Elizabeth in every way. She is terrific.''
Grant, the disgraced star of Four Weddings and a Funeral has been
charged with lewd conduct in public by LA police.
Liz's close friend, Lord Brocklehurst, today insisted: ''She is
bearing up under the stress and pressure. She has made no decision about
the future of her relationship.''
Miss Hurley fled her country hideaway near Bath, at the weekend where
she had spent the previous two days with Grant, for Sudeley Castle, in
Gloucestershire.

PRINCE Charles' personal surgeon is quitting the National Health
Service in a fury over changes in the system.
Professor Christopher Colton, the surgeon who treated the prince when
he broke his elbow in a polo accident, said he could no longer stand the
changes in the NHS.
Many of the reforms were more to do with ''politics than patient
care'' and at one point he said he was awarded a pay increase of #20,000
for treating fewer people.
The professor is taking early retirement from his post at Nottingham
University Hospital and says he will be glad to leave the NHS.

SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle, which will be the UK's biggest brewer if its bid

despite a weakening beer market.
Stronger performances from pub catering and the Center Parcs holiday
side helped towards the pre-tax profits rise in the year to April 30
from #222 million in the previous 12 months.
S &amp; N said it had confirmed its position as a leading national pub

The Edinburgh-based group said profits had declined 4.7 per cent to
#82 million after margins had fallen in the off-licence trade. However,
it had strengthened its share of ''an intensely competitive market''.

THREE upper-cuts from Lennox Lewis were enough to stop Australian
Justin Fortune in four rounds in a non-title fight in Dublin last night.
The former World Boxing Council heavyweight champion finally found his
range and power just as Fortune was beginning to cause him problems. It
was no more than expected with Lewis, at 6ft 5ins, towering over the
former Sydney nightclub doorman by eight inches.
He also had a weight advantage of more than two stone, but Lewis did
not have matters all his own way and admitted: ''He caught me with some
useful shots. I deliberately started cautiously just to size him up but
knew when I stepped up the pace I would get to him.
''He was very game and I was surprised he did not go down as I threw
some tremendous punches. The referee was right to stop it. I was really
bending my knees into those upper-cuts and did not want him to get hurt.
It's the brave guys who always get hurt.''
Lewis was stung into action by a solid jab from Fortune, replying with
two looping right hands at the beginning of the second round and two
more towards the end. At 17st 8lbs he was always going to be too
powerful but for a while found his man awkward to hit as Fortune
bulldozed in and frequently ended up with his head in the former
champion's chest or under his arms.
Lewis was now beginning to put his jab together but Fortune came back
at him in the third when his willingness to trade punches was well
received by the crowd.
In the next, Fortune's head was rocked back by the force of those
three upper-cuts and as he staggered back across the ring into the
ropes, referee Roy Francis immediately called a halt.
''They told me he was a big puncher,'' said the Australian, ''but I
must say I was disappointed with his performance.''
* NASEEM Hamed claimed after having stopped Colombian Juan Polo Perez
at the Royal Albert Hall, ''I could have done better.''
A near-capacity crowd saw the 21-year-old underline his world
championship credentials with a crushing fifth defence of the WBC
international super-bantamweight title.
''I'm creeping up on the world champions,'' said Hamed. ''They know
I'm going to take away their titles. It doesn't matter where I get my
chance, but I would love to box at the Albert Hall again. It's a super
venue.''

ENGLAND TEST SQUAD
MIKE Atherton has been reappointed England captain for the rest of
this summer's series against the West Indies.
Ray Illingworth, the chairman of selectors, said: ''Michael was
delighted to accept.''
Lancashire opener Atherton has led England in 20 of his 47 Tests since
succeeding Graham Gooch two years ago.
England's win at Lord's last week, levelling their six-match series
with West Indies at 1-1, was his sixth victory in charge, but Atherton
has also lost nine Tests, with five being drawn.
Illingworth said that England's selectors had formally invited
Atherton to continue during Saturday night's selection meeting in
Manchester.
It was an apt venue, since Jason Gallian, Lancashire's 24-year-old
Australian-born opener, has been called into England's squad for the
third Cornhill Test at Edgbaston next week along with his county
captain, Mike Watkinson.
Gallian will bat at No.6, unless wicketkeeper Alec Stewart does not
feel able to open after a long spell in the field. Then Gallian would go
in first along with Mike Atherton, as he does for Lancashire.
Middlesex's Mark Ramprakash has been dropped following his unhappy
pair at Lord's and scores of only four and 18 in the first Test at
Headingley.
Derbyshire all-rounder Phil DeFreitas also drops out of the squad to
make way for 33-year-old Watkinson, who has been picked because of his
ability to bowl off-spin as well as seam.
Illingworth said: ''If we feel the Edgbaston pitch is going to turn,
we might need a second spinner in the side. This squad gives us a few
options.''
Gallian, born in Sydney and a former captain of Australia Under-19s,
has Lancastrian parents and served a four-year qualification period to
become eligible for England last year.
Last winter he went to India with England A, and this summer, he has
made 537 championships runs at an average of 44.75.
Watkinson gets his first international recognition in the middle of an
outstanding season. So far he has scored 503 runs from only nine innings
at an average of 62.87. He has also taken 26 wickets, mainly with his
off-spinners at an average of 28.96. Team:
M A Atherton (Lancashire, captain) age 26, Tests 47; A J Stewart
(Surrey, wicketkeeper) 32, 47; G A Hick (Worcestershire) 29, 34; G P
Thorpe (Surrey) 25, 17; R A Smith (Hampshire) 31, 55; J E R Gallian

ST Johnstone last night dived into the transfer market by signing
Dundee right back John McQuillan.
Saints wanted to sign McQuillan before last season's transfer
deadline, but were frightened off by the asking price of #100,000.
Now manager Paul Sturrock hopes to reach an agreement with Dundee over
a fee and avoid going to a tribunal.
Ironically, McQuillan will make his competitive debut for his new club
against Dundee in the opening league game of the season at McDiarmid
Park on August 12.
Saints are now able to field a new full-back partnership, as Sturrock
recently signed Stenhousemuir left back Euan Donaldson for #80,000.
Meanwhile, former Falkirk and St Mirren defender Roddy Manley, who has
just returned from a spell in Hong Kong, will train with Dundee this
week and is almost certain to join them if he proves his fitness.
But Polish star Dariusz Adamczuk, the player at the centre of a
transfer tangle for the last year, has rejected the chance of returning
to Dundee on a year's contract.
* BARCELONA have transferred Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov to
Italian club Parma in a deal reported to be worth $15m, half of which
will go to the player.

ALAN Ball was reaching for the sky yesterday after agreeing to become
the new manager of Manchester City. Ball was desperately trying to find
a flight back to England after cutting short a family holiday in Spain
to complete the deal.
City chairman Francis Lee admitted that he was so determined to team
up again with his old England team-mate that he was prepared to travel
to Ball's Marbella villa to discuss the deal. However, Lee managed to
speak to Ball by telephone yesterday and persuade him to walk out on
Southampton.
''There are a few details to finalise, but I see no problems,'' said
Lee.
Lee now faces a #500,000 compensation claim from Southampton, and last
week solicitors acting for Brian Horton revealed that the former City
manager -- now in charge at Huddersfield -- was suing his old club over
compensation for the remainder of his contract, around #200,000.
* UNIQUE new youth leagues proposed by Rangers and St Johnstone to
develop the skills of Scotland's top schoolboys and also cut down the
number of competitive games they play will kick off in September.
Under the auspices of the Scottish League, 14 of Scotland's senior
sides will meet each other home and away in under-15 and under-16
matches which will have no points at stake, or medals or trophies.
Instead, games will consist of three, 30-minute segments and ''time
out'' coaching breaks.
Rangers manager Walter Smith said of the initiative: ''It takes away a
lot of the pressure and puts the boys in an environment where they can
learn.''

EAST LEAGUE:
THE second ball of the day at Raeburn Place accounted for Willie Tait
and after that it was all downhill for Edinburgh Academicals. Despite
another fine knock by Peter Flockhart, whose 71 was almost half the
innings total, and an early-order wobble by Heriot's, there were overs
aplenty in hand when Steve Litster hit the winning runs.
Victory for Corstorphine and a good draw for Falkland now means
second-bottom spot for Accies.
This grim turn of events contrasted starkly with the fortunes of their
visitors. The Herioters have yet to drop a point, whereas their
principal challengers, Carlton, were disintegrating against Grange.
Heriot's match-winner again was Shahid Aslam, who took six wickets for
62 off his 22 overs, Jim Love claiming the four others, and then steered
the ship clear of choppy waters at 55 for four in tandem with Mike
Allingham as they shared a fifth-wicket stand of 73, Allingham hitting
52 and Aslam 60.
There was some lively cricket across the way. The Carlton bowlers
regularly located a bald patch on the track which caused the ball to fly
off at unpredictable angles. Poor David McLean behind the stumps
conceded 34 byes in a remarkable total of 54 extras. And as Graham
Hurlbatt, Nick Peet, and Pete Steindl were to demonstrate later, that
was not the line to be bowling.
Grange prospered with 250 from 48 overs, Johnny Everett top-scoring
with 63 and Alec Davies hitting 53.
Carlton were soon losing wickets regularly to the three-pronged home
attack. Bryn Lockie (25) and Alan McLeod (31) offered the only
resistance as the innings petered out at 91.
Stenhousemuir hit 258 at Myreside, skipper Douglas Zuill 76 not out
and Eddie Pollock and John Owens contributing 40s. But they were unable
to bowl out Watsonians thanks mainly to Kenny Scott's 70, and had to be
content with the better of the draw.
So, too, had Falkland after Cheany Pandya (83 not out) had led them to
a massive 253 for three at home to Royal High. The visitors survived by
three wickets, Manzoor Elahi the mainstay with 82.
At Union Park, Freuchie set Corstorphine more than 200 to win and they
made it with three wickets to spare.

QUAICH
EDINBURGH made their Royal Bank of Scotland Quaich success academic
last night with a six-wicket victory at Selkirk against South to clinch
the trophy.
The hosts started brightly, and openers Jason Arnberger and David
Wilson raced to 45 inside half-an-hour, the former eventually making a
speedy 53.
The pace slowed after this but the runs continued to come, mainly
through man-of-the-match Tommy Parten, who made an unbeaten 102,
including a partnership with Peter Bruce which reached 78 as the locals
made a respectable 221 for six.
In reality, the Quaich was as good as won before a ball had been
bowled, but a heavy defeat coupled with a particularly bad run rate
might have proved Edinburgh's undoing.
However, despite a slowish start after tea, the capital side never
looked likely to let this happen.
Openers Brian Lockie and Chris Smith went early but Gordon McGurk soon
weighed in with 46 before Mike Allingham made 63 and Alex Davies hit an
unbeaten 46.
Edinburgh soon passed their target, making 225 for the loss of only
four wickets.
Strathclyde West secured second spot in the table with a two-wicket
victory at Hamilton Crescent over Strathclyde East.
Opener Alistair Storie made 70 for East, the home side, but despite 38
apiece from George Reifer and Greg Williamson, they could manage only
196 for eight.
After the restart, West made the target with three wickets to spare.
Central will have to settle for second-bottom despite a fine win over
North at McKane Park.
Aslam Raza's century, along with 63 from David Orr and 45 from Wayne
Sullivan, set the home side on their way to 295 for six.
After tea, Raza and Rob Mitchinson took three wickets apiece to
dismiss the visitors for 165.

GERONIMO, the IOR 50-footer run by Regatta Team Scotland, scored three
firsts from four races to win the 18-boat Class One at the Minerva Ford
Clyde Regatta at the weekend.
It landed Nicky Kirk the Clyde Master Helm trophy for the first time
and provided some consolation for the Largs-based thwarted Admiral's Cup
contender.
That project ground to a standstill due to a lack of sponsorship, but
the core of the proposed crew rarely put a foot wrong over the weekend's
four short Olympic triangle races in inconsistent shifting winds on the
southernmost of the two courses off Inverkip.
''It was pretty much the way things go, the boat likes light winds and
thankfully that's what we got, so we were able to capitalise,''
explained sailmaker Kirk, a former West Highland Week and Impala
European champion.
With an entry of 110 boats, boosted this year by a solid pack of 20
Etchells warming up for the UK championships which start on these waters
today, there was some evidence that a change of sponsors and revised
organisation might provide the initiative to rebuild what was once the
estuary's premier annual regatta.
Keith Lawrence, the local Gourock skipper, managed to hold off the
fiercely competitive Etchells fleet, taking two victories yesterday to
add to a second and third on Saturday.
Lawrence has paired Barcelona Olympian Andy Hemmings and Stuart
Childerly in his national championship campaign and they made a
formidable team winning the last race on the finish line from Adam
Gosling's Yes!
In second place overall was double Olympic gold medalist Poul Richard
Hoj Jensen.
Consistency throughout the very tricky conditions on the first day
when the upwind track frequently offered two competing winds and a
corridor of 'no man's land' where the conflicting breezes nullified each
other, prevailed into yesterday's two races for Simon Pender on the helm
of St Joan.
The double Scottish Series winner triumphed in the Sigma 33 fleet,
counting three thirds and a second.
In the Sport Boat class, Steve Goatcher, the Sonata UK champion,
steered the New Zealand designed and built Elliot 5.9 to an overall win
as his long-time rival from the Sonata and the Flying 15 classes Iain
Laidlaw won the Sonata Class in Rhythm Stick.

TWO world-record attempts back up the latest confrontation between
Linford Christie and Carl Lewis at today's grand-prix meeting in Paris.
A 100m contest between Britain's Christie and American Lewis may not
hold the glamour it once did, with both athletes having had slow starts
to the season. But Christie is the world and Olympic champion, having
taken the titles from Lewis, and the contest should still hold centre
stage.
Record attempts in Paris, meanwhile, will be made by Algerian
Nourredine Morceli and Ethiopian Haile Gebresilasie. Morceli already
holds the world 1500m, 3000m, and mile bests and will be seeking to
better the 2000m mark held by Said Aouita. Gebresilasie, who broke the
world 10,000m record earlier this year, has his sights set on
recapturing the 5000m after Kenyan Moses Kiptanui beat his one-year-old
mark with 12min 55.30sec last month in Rome.
Britain's Colin Jackson is scheduled to run in the 110m hurdles and
another world record-holder, American Mike Powell, is in the long jump.

MELANIE Neef, winner of the 400m race at the Europa Cup final at Lille
last weekend, maintained her season's unbeaten record with an
outstanding run in the United Kingdom women's league first-division
match at Copthall Stadium, Hendon.
Running just 24 hours before competing in the 200m sprint in the
grand-prix meeting at Gateshead, Neef faced four Great Britain sprinters
in the 400m race.
Running strongly, she recorded her third-fastest time ever for the
event to win the class race of the day in 52.0sec, defeating
internationalists Stephanie Llweyellyn (Shaftsbury), who set an Irish
record of 52.4 in second place ahead of Lorraine Hanson (Birchfield)
53.3, Louise Fraser (Trafford) 53.9, and Jennifer Stout (Essex) 54.5.
The Glasgow woman also ran a fast stage in the 4 x 400m relay, lifting
her team from eighth to third on the third stage of the race.
Jane Low recorded another Glasgow win in the 400m hurdles in 60.4sec,
with team-mate Alison Mahindru winning the B race in 63.3, and Hazel
Melvin taking the B triple jump with a leap of 10.88m.
Because of holidays, injuries, and weddings, Glasgow were without 11
of their top athletes, including Great Britain shot and discus
internationalist Alison Grey, and with just one match remaining are
second equal with Shaftsbury/Barnet AC behind leaders Sale Harriers.

DINGWALL'S David Barnetson set a second-division high jump record of
2.17 metres for Edinburgh Southern in the men's Guardian Assurance
British League meeting at Crawley.
But Southern could finish only fifth on the day and are now last
overall, two points behind Crawley.
Elliot Bunney, the former Scottish champion and Olympic relay silver
medallist, had his first individual outing of the season in the B 100
metres finishing third behind Toby Box in 11.0sec.
Edinburgh AC improved their position slightly by finishing third in
the fourth division at Meadowbank, where Doug Walker picked up the Man
of the Match award.
Walker, coming back after a month out through injury, won the 100m in
10.79 and the 200 in 21.49, both times achieved in spite of headwinds.
Stephen Hayward won the shot (15.08m) and discus (46.94m) while Darren
Ritchie won the long jump with a wind-assisted 7.33m.
The capital side are now fifth overall but only one point ahead of
Leeds City.
* COMMONWEALTH Games internationalist Ross Low (Red Star AC) won the
100m and 200m wheelchair races in the Scottish Handicapped Grand Prix at
Meadowbank, recording times of 18.07sec and 30.65 respectively.
Clubmate Karen Lewis set a Scottish record of 41.73sec for the 200m
event with an easy victory over her rivals.

WIMBLEDON, home of the aloof, the unaccommodating, and the detached
from reality. That takes care of the players, who seem to become more
mechanical and less human every year.
It has been an interesting first week at the Big W, as some of our
American friends like to call the championships, but which should really
be referred to now as the Big Bang because of the thunderous power being
used. The tennis has been poor so far and interest came from taking part
in the Great Debate: has the skill been bludgeoned out of Wimbledon?
Actually, when I say great debate that doesn't mean everyone who walks
through the gates is fretting over a decline in standards of on-court
excellence. No, the majority of the visitors -- from the blue bloods who
wander around the All England Lawn Tennis Club's gardens watching to see
if they are being watched, to the great unwashed who sleep on the
pavements outside -- are in awe of the place and its stuffy traditions.
One gets the impression that Wimbledon would survive as a main stop on
the world's sporting calendar even if the players stopped coming. We are
talking about a heady mixture of history and myth here. People want to
say: ''I've been to Wimbledon.''
Yet they would be doing themselves and the sport a great service if
they were to question their own part in perpetuating the myth that this
is a magical sporting kingdom.
By God, it is not the players who are preserving the event. If it were
left entirely to them, the astonishing appeal of Wimbledon would have
diminished long ago, and you have only to glance back over a first week
which offered little.
If it hadn't been for a weary old-timer, Mats Wilander, who played a
thrilling five-setter against Marc Goellner on Wednesday, Tim Henman's
decision to use a ball-girl as target practice, or Jeff Tarango's
variation on the old ''I'll get my big brother to you'' line after
having been bullied by an umpire, the first half of Wimbledon would have
been a crushing bore.
Despite the sweaty, grunting, clenched-teeth endeavour of it all there
are people who believe the tennis has been thrilling. They reckon
Hangdog Sampras and little baggy-drawers Agassi with his latest
superstar lady are enough to keep fans happy. But we need more. Granted,
Agassi did serve up some delights in his match against David Wheaton on
Saturday, but come on, let's cut to the tennis.
Is there anyone other than Agassi out there playing it? Is it true we
will never see the likes of McEnroe, Edberg at his peak, Leconte, Noah,
or Borg again? Have their successors been killed off by sheer power?
The search for the answers veered away from Wimbledon towards
Gleneagles, where the rich and famous were out in force again. This time
they were competing in the Rolex Jackie Stewart Celebrity Challenge,
which raised #450,000 for four deserving charities. The list of names
was impressive and among them were Rod Laver and Stan Smith, who occupy
their own slots in tennis folklore.
Smith, who won the singles championship in 1972 after a thrilling
five-set final against the first of tennis's really bad guys, Ilie
Nastase, stands in awe of the power being delivered by today's
champions, but then the American could be cited as one of the
forerunners of the heavy-duty serve. ''The power today is truly
amazing,'' he said. ''Not only the serve, but also the speed of the
returns and passing shots.''
However, Laver, whose affair with Wimbledon was aesthetically rich and
profitable, was more scathing of the modern player and the four-times
champion won't even bother watching this fortnight. ''I came over here
to help with this cause, but I won't go to Wimbledon,'' he said. There
was a weary resignation, maybe even a sadness, in his voice.
Laver, winner of the first Wimbledon in the open era (1968) and a folk
hero of the world's courts, was only an hour's flight from the tennis,
but he lacked the desire to stop by the scene of his greatest triumphs.
''Racket technology has taken the game on to a new level and at the same
time this technology has allowed more ordinary people to play,'' he
said.
''The rackets made it easier for people to become professionals more
easily. It used to be a player had a hard job with the learning process
before he was able to compete at the top, and that was because the old
wooden rackets demanded more skill and more work on shots.
''In my time there was a wider variety of shot and the full dimensions
of courts were used, whereas players today know that, as soon as they
get a slight opportunity, the power in their rackets will allow them to
put the ball away. In other words, they may take the easier option.''
Laver, like a growing number of players, fans, and organisers, worries
about the power and speed, and of what these two qualities are doing to
Wimbledon's image. ''Look at the French (Open), look at the tennis
played on the clay there,'' he said. ''It is so much more entertaining
and offers greater variety.
''Players are required to manoeuvre and engineer shots more there and
you would only get that kind of tennis at Wimbledon with, say, a match
between Agassi and Chang, two players who rely on speed, anticipation,
agility, and shot-making.''
The great Australian player offered suggestions like slowing the balls
further, allowing Wimbledon's grass to grow slightly longer, and
regulating the tension of racket strings, but he knows nothing will be
done. The money keeps washing over Wimbledon, which had a surplus last
year of #28,888,806.
Consider Laver's lot after he had won in '68, and becoming the year's
leading money-earner with $124,000, to Sampras' income from his last
year. He banked $3,607,812.
It is important to remember also that this figure is only prize money,
and if you wish an idea of how much Sampras might have earned in total
you would be erring madly on the side of caution if you doubled this
figure.
Players earn staggering amounts through endorsements, with the wealth
of even the tour's mediocrities reaching into millions, and perhaps by
looking at the sums it is easier to understand why most of these players
show a disdain for their public. So many dozens of them have reached
their own financial comfort zones that they see no reason to accommodate
anyone.
Karsten Braasch, whose claim to fame is a service action which looks
as though it was taught by a contortionist, earned $317,232 last year,
Jonas Bjorkman got away with $756,552, Andrea Gaudenzi took $445,699,
and somebody who is really nobody, John-Laffnie de Jager, was given
$124,731. I could rest my case there, but Ivan Lendl's career prize
money is only a couple of notes short of $26m, which suggests the sport
is out of control.
''Money is a problem,'' Laver said, ''and the more someone has the
harder it may be for him to wake up and push himself every day. When
your pocket is full, it is easier to lie in.''
He shook his head and wandered off to continue his fund-raising
effort. Small and wiry, but his 56 years beginning to show on his face,
Laver could put most of them at Wimbledon to shame, but he won't be
going. Doesn't see the point. Besides, he talks some sense.

THE Celtic Swing bandwagon came badly off the rails at The Curragh
yesterday when Peter Savill's colt trailed in miles behind the winner,
Winged Love, in the Irish Derby.
Celtic Swing has often displayed a dislike for firm ground, but a
dejected Savill refused to accept that the going, officially described
as good to firm, had caused his runner's downfall and believes something
must have been wrong with the 5-4 favourite.
''The run is too bad to be true,'' said Savill. ''The horse that
finished behind him in the French Derby has won. It's not as if he has
turned the form round by a length -- Celtic Swing was way behind.
''Kevin Darley (Celtic Swing's rider) said that, for him, the ground
was plenty fast enough, but I can't use that as an excuse. Too many
jockeys have praised it, having ridden on it in the last three days.
''We can't make any plans now. We will take him home and have the vets
look at him to see if we can find anything wrong.''
But as Savill scratched his head in bewilderment, Sheikh Mohammed
really enjoyed his day, for not only did Winged Love impress by getting
his head in front on the line, but earlier in the afternoon the owner's
Carnegie, last year's Prix de l' Arc de Triomphe winner, instigated a
Group One double for the Arab owner with a thrilling victory in the
Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud in Paris.
Sheikh Mohammed, who donated his first prize of #338,350 in Ireland to
local charities, said after the race that the Arc will be Winged Love's
main target.
''We were only hopeful after the French Derby but he had improved
since then and he will be an even better horse in the autumn,'' he said.
Walter Swinburn, third on best British finisher, Annus Mirabilis,
said: ''He's run a big race. His heart is twice the size of himself. He
got the trip well. He is a real special horse.''
* PIQUANT will carry the Queen's colours at Edinburgh this evening
when Her Majesty visits the course to open the new #750,000 corporate
hospitality complex and improved stable yard, writes Tom McConnell.
The eight-year-old will be partnered by Jason Weaver in the East
Lothian District Council Handicap, the second of two races which the
Queen will watch after her tour of the new facilities.
Although Piquant has won eight races he has not shown much form this
season. His last win was at Lingfield in November, and on his most
recent run at Goodwood he was fourth in an amateur riders' race.
Gospel Song, a winner of two races earlier in the season, is not
without a chance but Mark Johnston's Jubran, second and third on his
last two visit to Edinburgh, is the most likely winner.

FRANK Nobilo fought off local hero Bernhard Langer and rising Swedish
star Jarmo Sandelin to win the BMW International Open at St Eurach, near
Munich, yesterday.
The New Zealander, who lives in London, turned a five-shot deficit
into a two-shot victory to earn the #91,660 first prize. Nobilo, whose
last success was in Indonesia a year ago, fired a final-round 67 for a
16-under-par total of 272.
Victory was all the sweeter for Nobilo, who believes the Volvo
European Tour is getting tougher each year and that Nick Faldo's remarks
about ''comfort zones'' were out of order.
''The cuts are getting lower and the standards are getting higher,''
said Nobilo. ''After the way this year has gone, I am delighted to win
again. Five shots are difficult to get back.''
Sandelin and Ireland's Raymond Burns, who finished joint-seventh, both
stepped up from the Challenge Tour last season and are beginning to make
an impact.
Nobilo, who had a top-10 finish at the US Open, drew level with
Sandelin -- the overnight leader, who shot a course-record 63 on
Saturday -- at the turn thanks to an eagle at the first, followed by
five birdies.
Nobilo then made headway down the home stretch, fighting off the
threat from Langer, who is always a dangerous competitor and never more
so than on his home territory.
However, although the German also returned a 67, his 73 on the opening
day, when he was suffering from a neck injury, proved costly.
Leading aggregates (British and Irish unless stated):
272 -- F Nobilo (New Zealand) 67, 69, 69, 67 (#91,660).
274 -- B Langer (Germany) 73, 67, 67, 67; J Sandelin (Sweden) 68, 69,
63, 74 (#47,765 each).

ANNIKA Sorenstam completed an impressive second European victory in
three weeks yesterday and gave Sweden its fifth consecutive win in the
Hennessy Cup at Refrath, Cologne.
Sorenstam, winner in Austria last month, finished with a 68 for a
17-under-par 271 to take the #45,000 first prize. She was one stroke
ahead of Britain's Trish Johnson, who shared second place with British
Open champion Lotta Neumann, another Swede.
Gillian Stewart was the best of the Scottish trio. A final round of 72
left her at four under on 284, with Dale Reid and Julie Forbes three
strokes behind.
Sorenstam today travels back to America, where this week she plays in
the Jamie Farr Classic. Her attentions may well be focused on the US
Open in Broadmoor, Colorado, the following week, when she is likely to
be a serious contender.

STEVE Redgrave, three times Olympic champion and five times world
champion, concluded his career at Henley Royal Regatta with a flourish
yesterday. He won the Silver Goblets for the seventh time with partner
Matthew Pinsent at the end of the day's racing, after earlier setting a
new record time in the Prince Philip Cup for coxed fours.
Redgrave will be involved in a pre-Olympic training camp during next
year's regatta and, with plans to retire after Atlanta, now looks likely
to conclude his domestic career with a total of 15 Henley wins.
In Saturday's semi-final, Redgrave and Pinsent set a new course record
of 6min. 56secs., beating their own previous record by 13 seconds and
becoming the first pair to go through the seven-minute barrier.
A number of records tumbled yesterday. The Australian double of Markus
Free and Olympic gold medalist Peter Antonie, beat a USA squad crew by
just two feet on the line in the closest race of the day. Then in the
Grand Challenge Cup final, this year's young British crew pushed the
American world champions all the way to go down by just a third of a
length.
In the Diamond Sculls, Juri Jaanson of Estonia, beat the defending
champion Xeno Muller of Switzerland, while in the women's singles
sculls, Maria Brandin of Sweden, beat controversial Canadian Silken
Laumann, taking 23 seconds off the course record which she set up in
1993. Winners:
Grand Challenge Cup -- San Diego Training Center, USA.
Ladies' Plate -- Nottinghamshire County.
Thames Cup -- Imperial College, London.
Temple Cup -- Oxford Brookes University.
Princess Elizabeth Cup -- Eton College.
Stewards' Cup -- Cambridge University and Mladost, Croatia.
Prince Philip Cup -- Leander.
Queen Mother Cup -- Augusta Training Center USA.
Visitors' Cup -- Isis.
Wyfold Cup -- Lea.
Britannia Cup -- Wallingford.
Fawley Cup -- Windsor Boys School and Poplar Blackwall and District.
Silver Goblets -- Leander (Redgrave and Pinsent).
Double Sculls Cup -- Tweed Heads and Melbourne University, Australia
(Free and Antonie).
Diamond Sculls -- Panu, Estonia (Jaanson).
Women's Sculls -- Kungalvs, Sweden (Brandin).

DAVID Gillanders crashed out of the lead in then Burmah Scottish Rally
Championship at the weekend on the sixth round of the series, the Jim
Clark Memorial event.
The former British champion was leading after four of Saturday's seven
special stages when he made rare mistake. Having just taken the lead of
the rally from last year's winner Michael Horne, Gillanders was going
well in the Kielder Forest complex.
His Ford Escort Cosworth crested a rise only to find the forest road
veering sharper right than the treeline suggested. The car slid wide on
the bend and vaulted a ditch, from where it took spectators more than
half an hour to extricate the car.
John Baird, the Merseyside-based Edinburgh exile, now heads the 85-car
field, but Horne was just three seconds behind with two stages to go.
As winner of this event, in a similarly close-fought fight last year,
the big partisan crowd were willing local man Horne to repeat that
success. Over the penultimate forest road special stage, he clawed back
a second of Baird's lead.
Going into the final stage at Riccarton on the Scottish/English
border, Baird's lead now was two seconds. Ahead lay nine miles of
flat-out, timed to the second motoring, with two seconds separating the
two favourites.
Within a mile of the finish, Horne's Ford Sierra punctured a tyre and
dropped half a minute to Baird. That put victory beyond doubt and Baird,
with co-driver Martin Forrest, scored a first outright victory on a
national championship event. Neil Hiorns found the long trip north
worthwhile with third place overall ahead of Walter Henderson
(Carnwath). Results:
1, John Baird/Martin Forrest (Ford Escort Cosworth) 51min.24sec; 2,
Mike Horne/Monty Pearson (Sierra Cos) 51.50; 3, Neil Hiorns/Tom Watson
(Escort Cosworth) 52.26; 4, Walter Henderson/Jim Kinloch (Escort Cos)
52.37; 5, Gordon Smith/Graham Brunton (Escort Cos) 53.11; 6, John
Gray/Fergus Loudon (MG Metro 6R4) 53.26; 7, Chris Wagner/Alan Stark
(Audi 90 Quattro) 53.35; 8, Jimmy Christie/Jim Howie (Opel Manta) 54.01;
9, Bill Stewart/Bill McGhie (Sierra Cos) 54.21; 10, Bobby Youden/Ernest
Cowan (Escort Cos) 54.23.
Championship leaderboard: 1, C Wagner 129pts; 2, D Gillanders 118; 3,
J Baird 118; 4, W Henderson 117; 5, G Boyd 94; 6, G Gauld 90.

INJURY-HIT Tom McKean and Yvonne Murray made encouraging movements
towards top form in their first test of the season at the Gateshead BUPA
Games.
Though McKean could finish only seventh in the 800 metres behind
European silver medallist, Norway's Vebjorn Rodal, he slashed more than
two seconds off his season's best time, clocking 1min 47.76sec, with
which he was quietly pleased, considering the problems he has had
recently. Rodal scampered away from the field to win in 1-45.45.
''I'm not ready to run 1-45.0 yet but it's a step in the right
direction,'' said McKean.
The 31-year-old Uddingston star, who dropped out of last weekend's
Scottish Championships, tried to run a secret time trial in a
Lanarkshire League race at Coatbridge last Wednesday night, winning in a
slow 1-52.22.
The former European champion, who had knee trouble earlier in the
season, then made his British League debut for Haringey in London on
Saturday, winning the 800 in 1-50.25.
Sciatica-victim Murray showed no signs of the problem which kept her
out of the European Cup 5000m in Lille as she moved down a distance to
1500m to capture a gritty third just behind her great Irish rival, Sonia
O'Sullivan, in a fast 4-05.61. But there was no doubt about the winner,
Britian's Kelly Holmes sprinting clear in 4-04.21, the fastest time in
the world this year.
Mel Neef continues to break new ground and followed up her UK Women's
League 400m victory in 52.0sec at Barnet on Saturday with a new best
200m time of 23.35 in finishing second at Gateshead yesterday.
The top performance of the day came from Daniella Bartova from the
Czech Republic, who set a new world women's pole vault record of 4.14m.
Kate Staples -- better known as Zodiac on TV's Gladiators -- set new UK
and Commonwealth women's pole vault records with 3.80m.
Bartova's new mark was the first world record set in the arena since
Brendan Foster ran the 3000m in 7-35.1 on the day the stadium opened on
August 3, 1974.
Jonathan Edwards continued the magnificent form that saw him produce
the longest triple jump in history last weekend.
Edwards, in front of his home crowd, flew out to 18.03 metres in the
third round of the event -- the longest leap ever seen in Britain.
But, as at the European Cup in Lille last weekend, he was denied a
world record because of an illegal tailwind of 2.9m per second.
The Gateshead Harrier leapt an astonishing 18.43m in France last
Sunday but the wind also denied him a place in the record books that
time.
The wind finally died down for Edwards in the later rounds as he broke
his own UK record.
He equalled the 17.72m set last weekend in yesterday's fourth round
and, after having passed the fifth round, added two centimetres to his
legal best with his final leap to beat it.
The Gateshead Harrier also added 13cm to the UK all-comers' record of
17.61m set by Cuba's Yoelvis Quesada last year.
But Rob Denmark could finish only third in the 5000m, won by South
Africa's Shadrack Hoff. ''My mind was wandering on the last lap, which
is usually my forte,'' admitted the Commonwealth champion.
And there was worse trouble for European 400m champion Du'aine Ladejo,
who pulled up halfway down the back straight with a hamstring strain,
which must put a question mark over his fitness for the AAA
championships -- serving also as the world-championship trials -- in a
fortnight.
* KENYA will parade a galaxy of emerging stars blended with known top
performers at the world championships in Gothenburg next month after
some dramatic national trials held in Nairobi at the weekend.
With the main focus on the 800m -- where Olympic champion William
Tanui and world champion Paul Ruto were eclipsed in the semi-finals --
few noticed that established stars such as Paul Ereng, Billy Konchellah,
Patrick Konchellah, and Nixon Kiprotich had not even entered.
Instead, rising stars Joseph Tengelei, William Serem, and Philip
Kibitok completed a 1-2-3 at the games, used as trials for both the
world championships and the All African Games in Harare in September.
Former 10,000m record-holder William Sigei was beaten into sixth place
and former world champion Moses Tanui was dropped. Little-known Josphat
Machuka won in 27-53.0 followed by 20-year-old soldier Joseph Kimani and
cross-country star Paul Tergat. It was Kimani's major track debut.

WESTERN UNION:
FOR the past seven days, the Kilmarnock NK regulars have done little
else but moan. They reckoned it should have been them, and not
Uddingston, who rid themselves last weekend of the winless tag.
Those at Kirkstyle have been saying for ages that eventually things
would come good -- and that someone would suffer.
On Saturday, West of Scotland were on the receiving end at Hamilton
Crescent when Killie won their first DM Hall Western Union encounter of
the season. And they did it with style.
Alastair Storie, Mark Harper, and Jon Williams all got among the runs,
and were in turn removed by Asif Mujtaba in his spell that was worth
five for 56. From 76 for one after 27 overs, West managed 185 for six,
with the feeling being that the home side should have set a bigger
target.
But, given the way they set about the chase, Killie could have been
set 300 and still won with ease, as Mujtaba and Muzamil Malik especially
showed how to carry the attack to the bowlers.
After just three balls, Kilmarnock were 8-1, Mike Richardson driven
for 4, then edged to the boundary, before the bowler got his yorker to
work.
Mujtaba entered the fray, and simply destroyed the bowling. The
Pakistani Test man played every shot in the book, and some twice, as he
took just 54 balls to pile up his unbeaten 97, which contained 17
boundaries. At the opposite end, Muzamil Malik also went for his shots,
his 50 not out coming off 68 deliveries, with seven 4s.
In one ball short of 16 overs, they added 116 in an unbroken stand for
the fourth wicket, Kilmarnock knocking off the required runs in just 31
overs.
As one unwanted record went, so did a cherished one. Greenock lost for
the first time, beaten at Cambusdoon by defending champions Ayr.
Albert Simpson's 49 in 64 balls was in contrast to Bruce Patterson's
innings, with whom Simpson added 73 for the second wicket.
The Scotland opener struggled to find his touch on not the easiest of
strips. He hung around for 49 overs, by which time he had made 55. Andy
Baird and Adrian Holdstock applied the pressure, and the Greenock
batting crumbled. Only Ronnie Thomson, walking out when the score was
already 39 for three, made any impression. Ayr wrapped up both the
points and victory with eight overs remaining, Greenock bowled out for
126.
Poloc also bowled out the opposition, spin twins Keith Sheridan and
Muzaffer Mahmood reducing Drumpellier from 35 without loss to 138 all
out, leaving Poloc winners by 37 runs.
Elsewhere, there were a couple of quick finishes. By 4.22, Ferguslie
-- who gifted Uddingston 16 of their 69 runs in no-balls -- had won by
eight wickets. And, under an hour later at Titwood, championship leaders
Progress Software Clydesdale secured an identical result against Tilbury
Phoenix Kelburne.
Richie Henderson cleaned out the Kelburne tail, his five for 20
leaving the home batsmen needing just 75 for another win, achieved in
comfort, despite Aamir Hanif falling for a first-ball duck.

MICHAEL Schumacher accused Damon Hill of unsporting and dangerous
driving after having stretched his world championship lead following
victory in yesterday's French Grand Prix at Magny Cours.
Schumacher, who beat runner-up Hill by more than 30 seconds in his
Benetton, said he was shocked and angered by an incident involving Hill
on the thirteenth lap of the 72-lap race.
Hill, now 11 points behind the German in the quest for this year's
driver's championship, was leading in his Williams with Schumacher close
behind when the German said it seemed that Hill had ''brake-tested'' him
as they approached a backmarker.
''I was very angry with Damon,'' said Schumacher. ''But I am not
speaking to him about it until we have cooled off -- maybe at a quiet
moment later in the week.
''He seemed to lift his foot off the accelerator or maybe even braked
a little, and it was wrong. It was dangerous and unsporting. If he does
it again I know what to do with him.''
Schumacher had earlier said he was happy with the way the race went
for him as he took the lead from Hill after the first round of pit stops
and was never headed thereafter. ''Everything was just perfect,'' he
said. ''We were better prepared and quicker in the race. I knew when I
went into the lead I would win,'' he said.
Hill was baffled as to why the Williams team were finding it so
difficult to turn excellent practice performances into victory on the
track. ''It's a mystery why the car is good in qualifying but not so in
the race. It's something we must sort out,'' he said.
''Michael has extended his lead in the championship and that's not
good. But there is a long way to go and I still believe the title is
wide open.''
Hill's team-mate David Coulthard ended his three-race failure to
finish by taking third, although more than a minute behind Schumacher,
after having staved off a fierce bid for the podium from fellow Briton
Martin Brundle.
Norfolk-based Brundle was desperate to make the top three in his
Ligier team's home race but, despite a magnificent drive, was less than
a second adrift as he claimed his first points of the season.
''I did not expect to have such a battle with the Ligier,'' said
Coulthard. ''Martin was pushing very hard and I remembered the last time
he was behind me in Hungary last year -- I crashed.
''He got within lunging distance of me and I'd dreamt the night before
that I would crash on the last lap. But it is just good to finish and
get in among the points again.''
Brundle, competing for the fourth time since rejoining Ligier from
McLaren just before the start of the season, said: ''I've had three very
good races and no points previously, so it was good to get some finally.
''We would have been third but for our last pit stop, which cost us. I
would have got Coulthard eventually, as I was lapping a second faster
than the Williams, which I found amazing.''
Frenchman Jean Alesi could not deliver a second-successive victory
which the majority of the Magny Cours crowd wanted. He finished fifth,
with Jordan's Rubens Barrichello in the points for the second successive
race in sixth.
Eddie Irvine, aiming to follow up his third place in Canada, paid the
price for a poor second stop in the other Jordan to slip out of the
points into ninth. Mark Blundell finished eleventh after another
disappointing day for McLaren.
Johnny Herbert, forced out of the Canadian Grand Prix on the first lap
after a collision with Mika Hakkinen, lasted only until the third lap
this time.
Herbert's challenge ended when Alesi tried to overtake him on the
inside. The Londoner went off the circuit as Alesi and Ferrari team-mate
Gerhard Berger manoeuvred around his Benetton. Details (British unless
stated):

* WEST Indies coach Andy Roberts has admitted that his side, beaten by
England in the second Test last week, are suffering from mental fatigue.
Roberts saw his struggling team endure more misery at Hove yesterday
when they slumped to 97 for seven in reply to Sussex's 446 for nine
declared.
Only an unbeaten 70 from Keith Arthurton, plus stout resistance from
tailender Rajindra Dhanraj, enabled them to finish a weather-shortened
day on 167 for seven.
Rain and bad light, which allowed a total of only 30 minutes' play
after the first interruption, enabled them to regroup.
Nevertheless, Richie Richardson's side still face the prospect today
of becoming the first West Indies side to have to follow on in England
since the 1933 tourists suffered that embarrassment against Kent.
And if they are bowled out a second time, they will be the first West
Indies team to be beaten by an English county since 1976, when Middlesex
triumphed at Lord's.

WILLIE Donald is one of those seemingly laid-back six-footers who
treat cricket as a walk on the mild side.
After 42 years on this planet, 57 Scottish caps, 12 years with
Aberdeenshire, some of them as skipper, and 11 more years down in
London, where he played with Middlesex league side Teddington, when he's
asked to do something different . . . ''no problem.''
Like coming out of self-imposed retirement from cricket after his
banking job resulted in a move from England to Edinburgh; like opening
the batting for West Lothian against Fifeshire at Boghall on Saturday,
after skipper Steve Crawley had pulled a hamstring.
Donald teamed up with the in-form Sanjay Patel to put together West
Lothian's highest opening stand of the season. They put on 116 before
Donald was adjudged to have been lbw to Fifeshire's Lindsay Ferguson for
56, which included seven 4s and a 6. The look on Donald's face as the
umpire's arm was raised said all that was needed about his thoughts.
However, with only 151 to chase, and Patel in superb form, it seemed a
formality, although Ferguson again -- he also spilled two
caught-and-bowled chances -- and then young Ross Mitchenson snapped up
three more wickets to have the home side slightly nervous on 126 for
four. But Alan Farquarson joined Patel to steady the ship, and the final
total of 154 for four was easily reached, with Patel unbeaten on 70,
which included nine 4s.
Donald said afterwards that West Lothian, despite being bottom of the
league after a bad start to the season, could still challenge for the
title.
''We're unbeaten in our last five games, and have won four of them. We
are a new side, and have taken some time to settle. But now the better
weather is bringing harder wickets, we are playing much better.''
The same cannot be said for Fifeshire. Internal dressing-room politics
certainly do not seem to be helping the side, who seemed decidedly
listless as they lost their first wicket at 20, and slumped to 117 for
eight before Richard McMullins and Paul Norman put together a 34
partnership until Norman went for 19.
McMullins was unbeaten on 15 as Fifeshire reached 151 -- and that
despite a superb 46 by Wayne Sullivan. When he was out at 105 for three,
the collapse really began.
Chief tormentors were Crawley, who took three for 48 before having to
limp off injured, and Gordon Hollins, with three for 33. David Orr
wrapped up the tail with figures of two overs, one maiden, two wickets
for one run.
The dressing-room problems led last week to the resignation as captain
of Wayne Sullivan. He said: ''I don't want to say too much about it.
Basically, the lads were not happy with me, I was not happy with them,
so it seemed the best thing was to step down. They were not happy with
the way I was captaining the team.''
Bowler Keith Graveling led the side at Boghall, but with vice-captain
Ewan Ogilvie due back from America, it is thought that he will be
invited to take over.
Fifeshire certainly missed his experience on Saturday, and the fact
that unusually, Graveling not only failed to take a wicket, but was out
for a duck, possibly could be put down to the added responsibility of
having to captain an unhappy side.
Aberdeenshire, meanwhile, brought back memories of better days when
they moved to the top of the Caley 80/- Scottish Counties League with a
thrilling three-wicket win over Forfarshire at Forthill.
The home side had made 221 for five, with John Phillips unbeaten on
52, and Scott Carnegie, Bruce Ferrier, and Mike Cousin all in the 30s.
Sanju Mudkavi took five for 55.
But, led by Mike Smith's 63, with Colin Smith, Neil McRae, and Andy
Bee all in the 30s, Aberdeenshire reached 222 for seven, despite Gordon
Walker taking six for 62.
Stirling County moved into second-top place with a stunning victory
against Ayrshire at Prestwick Oval. Willie Morton destroyed the Ayr
batting with figures of six for 31, leaving them down and out on 127.
Despite Javed Ashraf taking three for 29, Kyle Wealleans' unbeaten 60,
aided by 33 from Alan Sievewright, took Stirling home by seven wickets.
Previous leaders Strathmore were involved in a fairly high-scoring
draw against Perthshire at Lochside. Perth's batsmen were in stunning
form, led by Chris Galloway's unbeaten 93. Lal Rajput hit 50, and Graeme
Ferguson and Kash Kalil each scored 33.
The total of 220 for three looked ominous, but Strathie got close,
finishing on 215 for six, with top scores coming from Grant Lawrence 61,
Nigel Hazel 59, and Mark Kelaher 47, Rajput taking five for 65.
Alistair McEwan's 74 was more than half of Clackmannan's all-out total
of 128 against Arbroath County at Lochlands, with Neil Burnett and Zahld
each weighing in with four wickets. Arbroath cruised to 132 for four,
John Salmond unbeaten on 65.

JONAH Lomu, New Zealand's World Cup giant, is set to dash the hopes of
league clubs desperate to sign him by agreeing a huge cash deal that
will keep him in Rugby Union for the next three years.
Other leading All Blacks could also soon be offered around #88,000
plus annual contracts, according to New Zealand's Sunday Star-Times. The
newspaper said there was a strong push for an annual base payment of
about #66,000 per year for all players who make the New Zealand side.
All Black coach Laurie Mains is quoted as saying: ''A package has been
agreed by Jonah and Phil Kingsley-Jones (his manager). Now Jonah has to
be given time during the next few days to go over it.
''What Jonah has said to the team and ourselves is that he really
wants to play in the next World Cup. Hopefully, it is just a matter of
us being able to finalise things.''
The amount offered to Lomu, who shattered England's World Cup dreams
with four semi-final tries last month, has not been disclosed.
The issue has been forced by a multi-million-pound television rights
deal with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and pressure from Rugby
League.

MICHELLE Martin recovered from losing the opening game to beat
fellow-Australian Sarah Fitz-Gerald and retain the women's world squash
title in Hong Kong yesterday.
The top seed from Sydney became the first player to win the crown
three times in succession with an 8-10, 9-2, 9-6, 9-3 final triumph over
fourth seed Fitz-Gerald.
''It's tremendous to win three in a row,'' said 28-year-old Martin.
''It was magnificent the first time, but this is the best of the lot.
''This win is also more satisfying because it was a harder final and
the pressure was on me. But I stuck with my game plan and experience
helped me through.''
Martin, whose brother Rodney is a former men's world champion,
squandered five game points in a marathon first game. But she produced a
string of winners in the second to square the match.
She had survived a match point when playing Fitz-Gerald in the
semi-finals of last week's Malaysian Open, but she never looked in any
danger of having to dig herself out of a similar hole.
Martin came out on top in a series of hard-fought rallies in the third
game and dominated the fourth at the front of the court to clinch the
match.

A SUPERB series of Flying Hanks gave Yoker's Rab Clark victory in the
13st 7lb final against Stuart Elliot, of Greenock, at the Springburn Fun
Day yesterday and made him the lightest wrestler in the past few seasons
to have stepped successfully so far out of his weight class.
Clark had already given away two stones to take first place in the
11st 7lb class before venturing any further up the weight scale.
Greenock's Hugh Ferns in his first appearance on the grass since
winning the European championships in Brittany, took the first fall from
Robert McNamara, of East Kilbride, in the heavyweight final but had to
be content with second place after going down to defeat by three falls
to one. Results:
Juniors 4st under 12 -- 1, G Corr (Woodside); 2, S Quinn (Springburn);

BRITISH riders flopped disastrously at Aachen yesterday as Jean-Claude
Vangeenberghe won the Grand Prix at the German event.
The 32-year-old Belgian, riding Omnistor Freestyle, came out top in a
nine-horse timed jump-off which none of the British hopefuls could
reach.
Michael Whitaker came nearest, but a second round mistake on Midnight
Madness kept him out of the jump-off and left him in 12th place.
Team-mate Nick Skelton, who posted a double clear on Dollar Girl in
the team effort, went out after an opening round error on the same
partner. Geoff Billington also went out with a single mistake on It's
Otto.
Vangeenberghe's third clear in 50.34secs earned him the first prize of
around #32,000, ahead of Frenchman Herve Godignon, who was 0.14s slower
on Twist du Valon. Results:
1 -- Omnistor Freestyle (J-C Vangeenberghe, Bel) clear 50.34secs, 2 --
Twist du Valon (H Godignon, Fra) clear 50.48secs, 3 -- Sprehe Rush On (L

back in 1980.
The Scots line up in their opening match this afternoon against
defending champions England, take on Wales tomorrow, followed by the
Channel Islands -- who are competing for the first time -- on Wednesday,
and Ireland on Thursday.
Scotland's challenge in the individual British championships is led by
national title-holder Colin Peacock from Marchmont, who goes straight

Nottingham.
* HOULDSWORTH's Ian Campbell, who plays for Scotland today, won the
Lanarkshire Singles Championship at Motherwell Miners Welfare on
Saturday, beating holder Finlay Forrest, from Eddlewood, 21-11 in the
final. Eddlewood had the consolation of a win in the junior singles when
Scott Cathcart counted a last-end 4 to edge out Scott McDonald from

SARAH Gourlay, in the best traditions of her native Ayrshire, is a
doughty fighter. That trait shone through at Ayr Northfield on Saturday
when she recaptured the Scottish Women's Singles Bowls Championship.
Gourlay, the winner back in 1991, has played better. But winners are
those who survive when not playing at the top of their form, and Gourlay
did just that to recapture the title.
Indeed, she was pushed to the limit in Friday's second round and
quarter-finals, surviving both matches by the narrowest of 21-20
margins. And only a superb last bowl in her morning semi-final,
conjuring up a 3, gave her a final place again with a 25-21 win over
indoor internationalist Evelyn McGarvie, from Perth Caledonian.
Gourlay's final opponent was international colleague Nan Stirling,
from Corstorphine, and the Edinburgh player dominated the early
exchanges. She opened up a 7-0 lead after just three ends and by the
close of the twenty-first end, had the winning post in sight at 19-12.
Gourlay, however, rallied to square at 21-21 after 26 ends and a double
on the next pushed the former champion 23-21 ahead.
Stirling rallied with two singles to square again at 23-all, but after
Gourlay had missed a golden chance to add a match-winning second on the
thirtieth end, the Ayrshire player got the shot she needed to take the
title again on the following end.
The junior singles final produced a remarkable fightback when Kelly
Wilson (Laurieston) recovered from 21-7 down to beat Alison Forsyth
(Galashiels) 25-22.
Ayr Forehill's Valerie Bryce and Dorothy Barr took the pairs when they
beat County rivals Isabel Marshall and Jessie Steed 29-12, thanks mainly
to a maximum count of 8 on the seventh end that turned a 6-5 advantage
into a commanding 14-5 lead.
Dumfries's Valerie Gordon, Alison McLelland, Mary Ferguson, and Irene
Brown enjoyed an uninterrupted run of 11 shots over the last six ends to
beat Doreen Hain's Riverside rink 25-18 and, in the triples, Dunblane's
Jean Thomson, Mary Wright, and Jean Nairn got the all-important shot on
the extra end to defeat defending champions Carnwath 18-17.
Colinton's Catherine Thorburn and Jessie Macdonald led from the fourth
end to take the two-bowl pairs title with a 20-15 win over Queen's Park.
Results of semi-finals and finals:
Singles -- S Gourlay (Annbank) 25, E McGarvie (Perth Caledonian) 21; N
Stirling (Corstorphine) 25, L McKenzie (Elgin) 11. Final -- Gourlay 25,

at Whitevale on Saturday when he beat Donnie Nelson 21-6. But Nelson's
club, Yarrow Recreation, did lift the senior fours, beating Titwood
16-6, while Carmyle, chasing both the triples and fours, had to settle

Partick Thistle 3,
IBK Keflavik 1
IT BEGINS to look as if Thistle and the Intertoto Cup are meant for
each other. There are matching facets which suggest that the Firhill
club might just take one of their defiant turns and end up qualifying
for the preliminary round of the UEFA Cup.
For most folk, this Intertoto tournament is eccentric; who is more
eccentric than the Jags? It is a cup competition which does not have a
cup. That seems ideal for the old Maryhill troupers. No-one really
understands this competition. Does anyone truly understand Thistle?
The way things are going, it would be entirely appropriate if the
Firhill lot topped their group and went on to go further. Zany? You bet
they are.
They have played two games, looked beaten on both occasions, yet ended
up with four points out of a possible six. Their best player of last
week, Ian Cameron, who was outstanding in the 2-2 draw with Linzer ASK
in Austria, preferred to do his flitting on Saturday, after having
failed to agree a new contract. Manager John Lambie brought in Tom
Smith, who scored two goals. It seems logical enough.
The coach of the Icelandic side, Thorir Sigfusson, while a bit miffed
that his side squandered a first-half lead, and missed two golden
chances into the bargain, believes Thistle are good enough to win their
next assignment, against Metz in France on Saturday. Said Sigfusson:
''They are very strong and deserved to win in the end. They are much
harder and more physical than Metz, who beat us 2-1.
''I think they can beat Metz but, if the Scottish team play the way
they did against us, they will have to careful of Metz' quick
breakaways. I thought Tom Smith was excellent, with good skill, and he
always wanted to use the ball sensibly.''
Sigfusson's team next meet Zagreb, and he promises they will be doing
their best to help the Firhill cause, even if IBK are out of the running
themselves now.
Lambie, never one to couch his views in ambiguous language, did not
have a high opinion of the Icelanders. ''They wouldn't live in the
premier league,'' he said. ''If we were geared up we would have
crucified them.''
The manager's intention to use these games as a pre-season build-up is
questioned by many in the game, but he insists that it is better than a
tour of the Highlands or Ireland or some other ploy of that type. ''We
did that last year and ended up with two players out of action before
the season started. This tournament is giving our lads a good work-out.
''They said it was too hot and maybe that explains why they were so
sluggish in the first half. I don't think summer football would suit our
players but, having said that, once we started playing our own way, we
got better.''
As with the opening tie in Linz, Thistle's inclination to pass the
ball about at the back did not meet with the manager's approval. He was
waiting for them at half-time to give them a fair old rollicking, which
produced the desired change of style and gave the Icelanders a taste of
what the up-and-at-'em game is all about.
''These teams like to give you all the time in the world to build up,
but then they hit on the break. I hate to say it, but our best efforts
in the first half came from long, Nicky Walker clearances. Once we went
at them we gave them problems.''
Lambie, you would guess, has not been deterred by the defection of
Cameron or the fact that four other first-team regulars, plus many
others on the fringe, are out of contract. As well as Cameron, Greg
Watson, Alan Dinnie, Steve Pittman, and Derek McWilliams have yet to
sign new deals.
''I don't expect to have many problems,'' said the manager. ''If any
of them can better themselves they are free to do so, but everything
will change after 31 days, when we stop paying wages.''
He had hoped to have at least one new face in the side by the weekend,
but may not make it even by next weekend. However, he is determined it
will be done. Asked about filling Cameron's role, he said: ''If he
doesn't come back, I will just go out and sign someone better.''
Striker Rod McDonald had to leave the field after 23 minutes,
following a severe tackle that left him with an ankle injury. He was
taken for X-rays later but, other than that and a niggling Wayne Foster
injury, the pool seems in good fettle for the next chapter of this
bizarre summer tale.
They didn't look too sparkling after IBK, who had been content to let
Partick make the running, struck with a fine goal scored by their best
player, Yugoslav Marko Tanasic, in 20 minutes.
The Thistle crowd, all 3182 of them, had been in benevolent summer
mood until then, but they changed their mood, as Scottish fans do, when
their heroes lost their way a bit. ''Bonuses, ya balloons?'' was one
heart-felt cry. ''We should get the dough for turning up.''
They were a diferent team after the break and goals seemed inevitable.
Albert Craig headed in the equaliser seven minutes after the break,
although there were spoil-sports who suggested the Icelandic defender,
Holgi Bjorguinsson, had actually made more contact.
Seventeen minutes afterwards, Smith scored the first of his two goals,
a well-struck right-foot shot, and nine minutes from time added the
finishing touch to a neat bit of play by Roddy Grant.
Craig, the captain, reckons the toughest game could be in Metz on
Saturday, but also believes Thistle could win it and virtually be
through to the next stage. It might be best not to argue.
PARTICK THISTLE -- Walker, Dinnie, Pittman, Watson, Welsh, McWilliams,
McDonald, Craig, Grant, Smith, Foster. Substitutes -- Cairns, Milne,
McKee, Docherty, Gibson.
IBK KEFLAVIK -- Gottskalksson, Bjorguinsson, Steinarsson,
Gudbrandsson, Sigurdsson, Finnbogasson, Hauksson, Tanasic, Margeirsson,
Einarsson, Gudmundsson.

OCCASIONALLY in the game of golf you get the feeling that somehow it
is going to be your day, writes Scott Crockett. Borderer Graham Davidson
experienced that at Lundin Links yesterday as he triumphed in the East
of Scotland Open.
Five strokes behind the leaders at the halfway stage, a course
record-equalling six-under-par 65 in the third round of the Bank of
Scotland sponsored event put him one stroke off the pace, then a closing
71 ensured victory by a stroke from Graham Lowson and Stuart Meiklejohn.
The mere statistics of the final round, however, do not do justice to
the manner in which they were achieved, particularly the events of the
last five holes.
One over par at the turn, Davidson had seemingly blown his chances
when he drove out of bounds at the 512-yard thirteenh, but amazingly
rescued a par-5 courtesy of an eagle with his second ball, holing a putt
of 35 feet.
As if that was not enough minutes later, at the 314-yard sixteenth, he
chipped in from the adjacent seventeenth tee for an eagle 2, which gave
him the lead.
Lowson failed with the birdie putt from 10 feet at the last which
would have taken the contest into a play-off. Meiklejohn, the 1993
winner, also harboured play-off hopes before three-putting the
eighteenth from 50 feet. Leading aggregates:
278 -- G Davidson (Langholm) 71, 71, 65, 71.
279 -- S Meiklejohn (Aberdour) 69, 73, 66, 71; G Lowson (Crieff) 71,
67, 68, 73.
280 -- G Beveridge (Leven Thistle) 70, 69, 69, 72.
282 -- D Downie (Ladybank) 74, 70, 69, 69; A Turnbull (Innerleithen)
70, 73, 67, 72; M Goggin (Australia) 70, 72, 69, 71; B Williams
(Ladybank) 72, 68, 71, 71.
283 -- S Whiteford (Lundin) 70, 67, 73, 73.
285 -- S Armstrong (Ratho Park) 71, 76, 68, 70; C Hislop (Powfoot) 71,
72, 72, 70; B Smith (Duddingston) 69, 70, 75, 71.
286 -- D Orr (East Renfrewshire) 70, 70, 73, 73.

* KYLES of Bute won the Argyll and Bute Team Trophy at Tarbert
yesterday with a three-ball aggregate of 203, two strokes clear of the
Tobermory trio. The Kyles team's cause was aided greatly by a
four-under-par 62 in wet and windy conditions from Gus Finlayson.
Leading aggregates:
203 -- Kyles of Bute (T White (4) 72, W MacDonald (10) 69, A Finlayson

holes in two under par to beat three-time local winner John Bauer by two
strokes. Leading aggregates:
137 -- J Bauer (Lanark) 66, 71; G Rankin (Palacerigg) 68, 69 (Rankin
won three-hole play-off). 139 -- B Howard (Cochrane Castle) 73, 66; W

YOU have to hand it to Partick Thistle. Asked to put on an important
Intertoto European cup-tie on the unseasonal date, football-wise, of
July 1, the finely-honed Firhill machine was up to the task.
The representative of the parking conglomerate, Urchins plc, was on
hand to ask the usual question: ''Look efter yir motor, mister?'' The
wee wumman form the Sally Ann was out with her collecting tin.
Even the Firhill food franchise people, 007 Catering (''Licensed to
Grill''), were ready for the challenge of summer football with a menu of
strawberries and cream, a brochette of satay chicken on a bed of
endives, and a terrine of summer fruits. Actually, the last bit about
the food is made up.
The 007 people were offering burgers, bovril, tea, coffee, Pepsi and
Tango as usual. Although I am reliably informed that in the executive
dining area, the first course of pea-and-ham soup had been replaced by
prawns with melon.
The chap in front of me was having no truck with Wimbledon-style
menus. He was eating a pie supper. Despite the heatwave he also was
wearing a woolly scarf and bunnet. But many of the Firhill faithful had
embraced the good weather.
One old-timer who had concessions to the hot weather was greeted at
the main door with the words: ''Oh, it's you, Wullie. I didn't recognise
you without your bunnet.'' Another elderly Jags fan went for broke
fashion-wise and turned up for the game against Keflavik with a pair of
Bermuda shorts, a singlet, and straw hat which looked mighty fine,
finished off with black ankle socks, and the Marks and Spencers brogues.
Thistle's many female fans responded to the weather by turning out in
eye-catching summer apparel which made a pleasant change from the shorts
and colourful girls' blouses being worn by the players on the field.
But to get back to Thistle's great European campaign. Firhill fans
have had a slender diet at this level. The Jags got stuffed by Honved in
1972 in the first round of the UEFA Cup.
But those who follow Thistle are undeterred. Participation in the
Intertoto -- or the It's A Knockout Cup or the Cup-losers' Cup, as some
call it -- gives them the chance for European adventures. Some 50 of
them had followed the Jags to Linz in Austria and were proudly showing
their holiday snaps to fellow Thistle fanatics in the Jackie Husband
stand.
More than 400 are set to bus it to France next weekend for le crunch
against Metz. After Saturday's match, grown men, having seen the notice
in the Jackie Husband lounge at the Woodside Bar advertising a #49
return trip, were busily constructing scenarios which might convince Her
Indoors of the need to see Thistle through these important times.
About 3800 fans were treated to a game of dubious quality. Misplaced
passes and many embarrassing attempts at ball control, but what do you
expect when you ask Partick Thistle to play on a pitch which isn't
waterlogged?
Given the heat, it was understandable that the fans, smothered in
factor 20 suntan lotion, were in lethargic mood. One diehard tried in
vain three times to get some community singing going with ''We love you
Thistle, we do . . . '' He eventually settled for a solo ''I love you
Thistle, I do . . . ''
Thistle, after having gone behind to a team they should have
mollicated in the first 10 minutes, then scored three beautiful goals
and the smiles on the Firhill faithful were beatific.
But, as ever, there is no point in being a football fan if you can't
have a good moan about the board of directors. Chairman Jim Oliver and
his colleagues appear to be giving their supporters a lot to moan about.
Fifteen players, including last year's player of the year, Ian Cameron,
are out of contract and have been offered Oliver Twist-style wages.
The Thistle fanzine, Sick in the Basin (a reference to the proximity
of the canal to Firhill), asks where Partick Thistle's money from
healthy gate receipts is going. Certainly not into players' wages or
into big-money buys.
The fanzine vendor made interesting allegations about the chairman.
The laws of libel prevent me from giving details.
Sick in the Basin also suggest that George Galloway, Labour MP for
Hillhead, was involved in a group interested in buying Partick Thistle.
This seems unlikely, given Gorgeous George's affiliation to Dundee
United and the fact that Thistle aren't even in his constituency.
It's going to be a long, hot summer, we hope, at Firhill.

JIM Gallagher surrendered a three-shot lead before fighting back to
clinch a dramatic victory at the $1.25m St Jude Memphis Classic in
Memphis, Tennessee, yesterday.
He sank a 10-foot par-saving putt on the final hole to eke out a
one-stroke win over fellow Americans Jay Delsing and Ken Green.
Gallagher seemed in command until he double-bogeyed the twelfth hole
and bogeyed the thirteenth on the Southwind TPC course to let his
pursuers back into the hunt.
However, five closings pars was all Gallagher needed to clinch his
fifth US Tour victory, and his second of the year, after a closing
one-over-par round of 72.
He finished at 17-under 267 to collect 216,000 and jump to eleventh in
the US Ryder Cup standings. The top 10 players after next month's US PGA
Championship automatically make the American team.
''My putter's what kept me in there all week and it saved me at the
end,'' said Gallagher.
Delsing tied Gallagher with two holes left, but he bogeyed the
seventeenth and narrowly missed a birdie putt at the last. Final
aggregates (American unless stated):
267 -- J Gallagher 65, 62, 68, 72.
268 -- J Delsing 69, 63, 69, 67; K Green 68, 67, 65, 68.

* TOM Weiskopf won the first major title on home soil of his 31-year
career with a dominating four-stroke victory yesterday at the US Senior
Open at Bethesda, Maryland.
Driving powerfully, putting elegantly, and recovering from trouble
calmly, Weiskopf ran away from his long-time friend and nemesis Jack
Nicklaus by shooting a final-round 68 for a 13-under-par total of 275.
Nicklaus shot a five-under 67 to finish alone in second place at 279,
with Japan's Isao Aoki and Bob Murphy five strokes behind the winner at
280. Leading aggregates (American unless stated):
275 -- T Weiskopf 69, 69, 69, 68.
279 -- J Nicklaus 71, 71, 70, 67.

CAMOGIE is girls' hurling. It is the first time it has been played in
Scotland because hurling is much the same game as shinty and, until
recently, girls didn't play any sport at all, let alone shinty and
hurling.
But Irish girls did, because the Gaelic Athletic Association goes in
for dance and sport. Dance is important, for since the remarkable
achievements of River Dance at the European Song Contest, Irish dancing
is much to the fore. In truth, Irish dancing has been splendid for years
and, all credit to this newspaper, we have been writing about it for
some years, too.
But the purpose of the GAA has been to bring back -- a bit like the
Gaelic language, really -- Gaelic arts and sports. One of them was
camogie -- hurling for girls, and grand it was.
Truthfully, some of the girls were not girls and some of them were.
One was called Colette and was in her thirties. She was playing for the
Toryglen, Glasgow-based Tir Connail Harps, replendent in green skirt and
gold-and-green top. So was the smallest girl on the park, who was eight.
There are 25 girls playing camogie in South-side Glasgow, most of them
of Irish origin, some of them even Irish. Yesterday, there were Irish
girls playing against the Harps, too. Two of them and both representing
Lochgilphead. This takes a bit of explaining. Shinty has for many years,
like many other male sports, eschewed females in their games, but things
have changed. Shinty now permits women and girls to take part in what
is, after all, a splendid sport. This is a recent development, as Jean
and Rosie and Lesley told me.
All three played shinty. Rosie, from Edinburgh, a textile designer,
told me more. ''We got into this from shinty: just liked playing sport.
Speak to wee Stevie Coyle. Here's her cousin Katie: she's only nine.''
The sudden realisation that girls don't have the same age differention
as boys possess was a bit of a shock. Not really, for I have seen this
before. Yesterday was a celebration, a bit, of Scotto-Irishism for there
were displays of Irish dancing and Irish consciousness. Actually not
much dancing, really, because the rain would have ruined the dresses
which are elaborate and incredibly expensive. But the wee girls and boys
danced for me all the same to the tune of an Irish band giving Rose of
Mooncoin fair laldy.
A lot of the children were from Holyrood Secondary, a nearby school.
Nearby? It is the biggest secondary school in Scotland, and in common
with many another educational establishment, it doesn't have enough
sport for the children. But there is most certainly not enough sport for
girls.
Despite the fact that camogie exists for girls -- the stick is for
young people, especially girls, and is different from the caman in being
narrower and rather more like a hockey stick -- despite the rules which
are designed for girls and young boys, despite all that, camogie has
very little opportunities for Irish girls.
There is no girls' shinty in Scotland, and no girls' hurling. Celts
seem to be similar to every other culture in that the men decide to stop
women from playing anything at all other than a hapless harlotry. This
is perhaps not fair.
Because, as in many sports, it is men who are helping out. The coach
for Tir Connail is none other than Jim McCurdie, a legendary figure in
Gaelic athleticism. Let me tell you about this Association. It started
up trying to recreate the world of Irish Gaeltacht. I mentioned Irish
dancing and rightly so, for Highland Dancing has but disappeared for
boys. Outside of a few spots in the Western Isles, shinty has gone.
Irish dancing is back and the boys are back taking steps. Thank God.
Yesterday at Cathkin Park, where the Third Lanark once were back in
the days of Jimmy Mason, with me standing once again on the terraces of
this hallowed ground, I watched what is, after all, everything which
sport is all about.
There was a 37-year-old girl playing out there, and a wee
eight-year-old called Anne Marie Collins. There was Katie, aged nine,
whose cousin was playing. There was Marie, who I daftly asked, after
interviewing her and getting all the information, what she did for as
living. She has five children. She looks after weans for a living and
quite right, too.
The rain came on, which was upsetting considering what the weather in
Scotland has been like for the past month. Tir Connail won, by three
goals to two goals and a point, against the team which had come all the
way from Lochgilphead, and the Highland girls with two Irish girls in it
as well.
Later on at night I dined with the girls. I even sang. I sang a song
from Philomena Begley's repertoire, ''She's just her mummy and daddy's
little girl.'' I sang it to a wee lassie called Collette Greene, who is
from Ireland. She telt me not be so sentimental and bought me a drink.
It was a good day.

CELTIC'S hopes of persuading Paris St Germain star David Ginoli to
come to Scotland rose and sank almost at the same time yesterday.
It became clear that the main rivals for the French winger's
signature, Barcelona, have abandoned their plans to buy the
internationalist, thus leaving the way clear for the Parkhead club to
lead the race.
However, sources on the Continent indicate that the reason Barcelona
manager Johan Cruyff decided to step back was because of the wage
demands of the St Germain player.
Ginoli asked for a basic salary of #1.2m a year and a three-year
contract to go with it, demands which proved too much even for Cruyff to
tolerate.
The French winger, who made a huge impression in the Champions' Cup
quarter-final against the Spaniards last season, has fallen out with his
French club to the extent that they have told him he can move on if he
wishes.
Now the prospects of any club, other than in the Italian Serie A
league, meeting his demands seem remote.
That also would seem to be the word to describe Everton's chances of
persuading Rangers to part with their international keeper, Andy Goram.
The Merseyside team's manager, Joe Royle, is said to be anxious to get
Goram as a replacement for Neville Southall, the 36-year-old Welsh
international keeper whose testimonial game will be against Celtic in
August.
Royle has a long association with Goram over seven years at Oldham
before he went to Hibs for #200,000. He joined Rangers for #1m soon
after Walter Smith took over in 1991 and went on to become Scotland's
No.1 goalkeeper.
Although he was put on the transfer list last summer because Smith
felt Goram had not applied himself to recapturing fitness after a series
of knee operations, he has since won his way back to favour.
The keeper missed the second half of last season because of further
injuries but is fully fit again and will be a keen member of the Ibrox
side for their bid to get into the Champions League again this season.
Smith knows that Goram, as a Scot, is one guaranteed quality player for
the European competition and that is a major reason for keeping him in
his place.
* JOCK McStay, will sign for East Fife in a bid to rebuild his career.
The 29-year-old defender, at the centre of the Duncan Ferguson
head-butting incident, was freed by Clydebank last season.
And now McStay is hoping to put the trauma of the past year behind him
with a move to the second division outfit.
Manager Steve Archibald said: ''Preliminary negotiations have gone
well and I'm hopeful we can complete the deal.''
''McStay is a good, versatile player and I would be delighted to bring
him to Methil.''
* CELTIC will be forced to play in the European Cup-winners' Cup
preliminary round because of a Yugoslav second division side.
Modest Obilic lost 4-0 to League champions Red Star Belgrade in the
Yugoslav Cup final. But because Yugoslavia are rated higher than
Scotland, UEFA will rank Modest in fifteenth place, one above Celtic.
And only the top 15 will be seeded and have the luxury of avoiding the
preliminary round.
There are 49 entrants to the tournament, including holders Real
Zaragoza, and that number must be slashed to 32 for the first round
proper.
Celtic would have received the final seeded place had UEFA not taken a
late decision to welcome back teams from war-ravaged Yugoslavia.
Celtic will find out who they face in the preliminary round when the
draw is made on July 12.

FINANCIAL markets are likely to remain subdued this week as the battle
for the Conservative leadership continues.
Their initial hope for a resounding first ballot win for John Major
has disappeared and uncertainty will prevail until the issue is
resolved.
The FTSE-100 index did rally on Thursday and Friday last week but at
3314 it is still nearly 100 points down on its level before Mr Major
made his dramatic stand.
Business has been thin, with fund managers sitting on their hands and
the index could easily slide again this week, though many analysts
believe buyers would come in at the 3250 level.
Perhaps the worst outcome would be for Mr Major to win the battle on
the first ballot but not have enough votes to have won the war. This
would merely extend the uncertainty in the market's view, leaving the
basic split in the party festering whatever gloss the Major camp put on
the result.
A Major withdrawal and a second round possibly involving Michael
Portillo and Michael Heseltine would mean another week of uncertainty
without even the assurance the leadership issue would be resolved even
then. The market abhors a vacuum and tends to drift lower in such
conditions.
Sterling and gilts will be fearful that a chastened Mr Major or a new
leader would not be able to resist a loosening of monetary restraint in
a desperate attempt to win favour with the electorate.
There is also the worry that the Government would be forced into an
election before 1997 which it would almost certainly lose resulting in a
new and inexperienced Labour administration full of plans for the
economy, forcing interest rates higher.
THE Chancellor of the Exchequer meets the Governor of the Bank of
England on Wednesday morning in the immediate aftermath of the
first-round vote for the leadership of the Conservative Party, writes R
E DUNDAS, Chief Financial Editor.
Kenneth Clarke will stick to his view that the evidence of a slowdown
in the pace of economic activity has justified his decision to reject
calls from the Governor of the Bank of England for a rise in interest
rates.
Sterling remains weak, but it is difficult to see what additional
information Eddie George could muster to persuade the Chancellor that he
was wrong and should agree to a rise in rates.
Across the Atlantic the Federal Open Market Committee meets on
Wednesday and Thursday, but strong house sales figures last week are
thought to have dashed hopes that the US central bank would cut American
rates.
The week is light on official statistics. The narrow measure of the
money supply, due today, has followed an erratic path in recent months
because of the volatility of bankers' balances.
A bounceback in these last month is forecast by James Capel's Adam
Cole to give a 0.7% rise in M0, mainly notes and coins in circulation,
for a same-again year-on-year growth rate of 5.9%.
Also due today are the figures for new credit, expected to show a
recovery from April's #498m to #550m in May. Credit card lending is
known to have been stronger, and retail sales rose.
With the pound in the toils last month the reserves, due tomorrow, may
have fallen by an underlying $50m.

Paul Motian's Broadway Music band knows jazz and what can be achieved
with its trendy reinterpretation of tunes. Keith Bruce reports on the
quintet which is full of surprises
THE oft-repeated adage that the path to building a jazz vocabulary is
to learn to play the standards, is somewhat out of fashion these days.
Musical boundaries are crumbling and many players are suspicious of the
use of the word jazz at all, never mind a retread of Body and Soul. On
the other hand, since 1988 Paul Motian's Broadway Music has been giving
the lie to such trendy disregard for the tunes that have been the
foundation of jazz.
Motian has appeared in Glasgow before -- on the same day in 1992 -- in
his superb trio with guitarist Bill Frisell and saxophonist Joe Lovano.
A quartet, with the addition of Charlie Haden on bass, recorded the
first two On Broadway albums at the end of the eighties. They have
recently been joined by volume three, which sees the band further
expanded with Lee Konitz on alto sax. Marc Johnson, another regular
Motian sideman, is on bass for the Glasgow concert, which kicks off a
European tour.
For those used to standard treatment of standard tunes, Broadway
Music's approach will seem oblique, and that can be put down as much to
the company Motian keeps as to his own distinctive style of drumming.
With his own band Frisell has been reinventing the idea of the standard
by covering songs like Madonna's Live To Tell, but there is no doubting
each Broadway Music player's familiarity with the standard repertoire --
a knowledge of the song has to be there before it can be taken into new
territory.
''I love those tunes and it is music closely associated with the
people I've played with. But I learned some of them because there were
lots of times in New York when times were hard and I couldn't do the
things I wanted to do. I played weddings, floorshows, and bar mitzvahs.
I even played with Cab Calloway one time -- it was a gig,'' says Motian.
The addition of Konitz, a player of Motian's vintage rather than
Lovano and Frisell's, might seem almost safe in the context of the
band's unconventional approach, but Motian bridles at the gentle
suggestion that the altoist is less aggressive than the ferocious
Lovano.
''I'm not sure about that. He's a jazz legend. I've known Lee for many
years and worked with him in New York in the fifties. He fits well with
Joe -- it's two different sounds but they sound great together. It is
more frosting on the cake.''
The recipe is not consistently that straightforward, however. This
quintet concert is not what it seems. ''There's not always five of us on
stage at the one time,'' the drummer explains.
Motian promises some trio music and the enticing prospect of an alto
and tenor duo of the two saxophonists. ''Just keep your ears open and
enjoy it,'' is the band-leader's advice.
Motian always has a number of projects on the go at one time, using
different musicians to play different music and touring with different
bands at different times of the year.
His most recent release in the US is by his Electric Be-Bop Band, an
outfit that includes bassist Steve Swallow, two saxophones and two
guitars, and ploughs through another repertoire: the classic jazz
compositions of the bop era, including Ornithology, Two Bass Hit, and
Round Midnight.
That band is set to tour Europe in November. It is to be hoped that
Scottish promoters who operate outside of festival time take note.

CONNECTED by the great motorway arteries of the M1 and A1 as they
stride northward from London, the Shires of Middle England are too often
neglected by visitors drawn by the better promoted pleasures of
Britain's more touristy destinations. However, those who bypass this
region -- less poetically labelled the Midlands -- are missing much.
One of the shires that form this extensive territory is that of
Derbyshire headed by its traditional county town of Derby. Let it be
said that Derby is no showplace of the likes of Chester or York but
nevertheless has become a most attractive and well laid-out city that is
a pleasure to explore.
Its heritage embraces many famous names including Rolls Royce and
Royal Crown Derby, all proudly reflected in Derby's beautifully devised
free-entry museums. Its Eagle, Audley and Main covered shopping centres
and pedestrianised St Peters Street, St James and Irongate shopping
areas together with the magnificent Market Hall, blend comfortably with
ancient buildings and half-hidden corners of historic allure.
Kedleston Hall stands 4[1/2] miles north-east of the city and remains
a masterpiece of sumptuous style as does Calke Abbey to the south, home
of the Harpur-Crewe family and a jumbled treasure trove of furniture,
pictures, cartoons, books and maps, stuffed birds and animals, minerals,
shells and everything under the sun. Nearby is yet another great house;
the lived-in (by Lord and Lady Kerr) Melbourne Hall, one-time residence
of Lord Melbourne, Queen Victoria's first and much-loved Prime Minister
who gave his name to the Australian city.
Touring anywhere in Derbyshire is a joy, the villages of thatched and
picturesque cottages are well-endowed with mouth-watering pubs that make
perfect sources of home-cooked meals. Repton has its celebrated public
school, Cromford its Arkwright Mill, historic canal and High Peak
railway, Crich its Tramway Museum, Ripley the Midland Railway Centre,
and Lea is home to a striking collection of rare rhododendrons, azaleas,
alpines and conifers.
Should theme parks be to your taste then Derby can oblige. Within the
city's boundary can be found the American Adventure while the reservoir
of Carsington Water hosts a variety of activities of a more nautical
flavour. But the Disneyland of Britain, the redoubtable Alton Towers,
offers a thrill a minute if you go in for that sort of thing.
From high peak to the big wheel, Derby heads a county that has
everything at the heart of the under-appreciated, even spurned, shires
of Middle England.

TOUR DE FRANCE
CHRIS Boardman was back in Britain last night for an operation on
three broken bones after having crashed out of the Tour de France on
Saturday, less than two minutes after the start of the three-week race.
Boardman, dreaming of a second prologue victory in the event, fell
heavily on a left-hand bend as he took risks on a rain-soaked 4.5-mile
circuit in the Breton port of St Brieuc.
The 26-year-old star from Hoylake, Wirral, underwent an operation at a
Birkenhead hospital last night after having been flown back from
Britanny.
Boardman, who is expected to be out for up to two months, said: ''I
have to think of the future now.'' He sustained a double fracture of his
left ankle and a broken right arm and said yesterday: ''The conditions
were extreme and dangerous.
''I really wanted to win the first stage. I was just pushing a little
bit too hard. It was a wet bend at 80kmh. I just lost the back wheel and
went spinning along the ground. I hit the barriers and then,
unfortunately, the team car hit me as well, because it couldn't quite
stop in time.''
The brave Briton, who won the prologue last year at an average speed
which was a record for any stage in Tour history, got back on his bike
and tried to carry on, but the pain was too severe and he was carried
away to his team car.
Boardman's accident was provoked by a rainstorm which turned the
traditional prologue time-trial start to the Tour into a mockery.
Almost half of the 189 riders in the field rode in perfect sunny
conditions, but the breaking storm left all the favourites, who started
later, with no chance of competitive performances.
Boardman's pain was Jacky Durand's gain. The Frenchman, one of the
early starters, won the prologue against all his own expectations to
wear the race leader's yellow jersey for the first time in his long
career.
Durand, a former Tour of Flanders winner, completed the course in
exactly nine minutes -- two seconds ahead of compatriot Thierry Laurent
and three faster than a third French rider, Francis Moreau. All rode
before the rain fell.
Spain's Miguel Indurain, last year's winner, took no chances on the
slippery course and came in 30 seconds behind Durand, and just five
slower than his expected main rival for overall victory, Tony Rominger
of Switzerland.
The irony of Boardman's accident was that the race had been put back
to the evening for the first time in 27 years so that his likely
prologue win could be seen live on prime-time television in Britain.
The first stage of the Tour took place in western France yesterday
from Dinan to Lannion, with Italian Fabio Baldato winning a mass sprint
finish, although Durand retained the race leader's yellow jersey.
Baldato, competing in his first Tour de France, outsprinted two
familiar figures in such finishes -- France's Laurent Jalabert and
Djamolidine Abdoujaparov of Uzbekistan -- at the end of the 146-mile
stage. Placings:
Stage: 1, Fabio Baldato (Italy) MG Technogym 5hr 49min 18sec; 2,
Laurent Jalabert (France) ONCE; 3, Djamolidine Abdoujaparov (Uzbekistan)
Novell, same time as winner. Others included: 6, Tony Rominger
(Switzerland) Mapei GB;  12, Miguel Indurain (Spain) Banesto; 26, Max
Sciandri MG Technogym all same time;  69, Sean Yates Motorola 24 seconds
behind.
Overall: 1, Jacky Durand (France) Castorama 5-58-18; 2, Brochard two
seconds behind;  3, Thierry Laurent (France) Castorama same time; 19,
Rominger  26 seconds behind; 50, Sciandri 52sec; 88, Yates  1-13.

Margaret Henderson makes a cautious journey by Alloway's auld haunted
kirk.
ROBERT Burns's pen had a way of preserving everything it touched,
whether in Alloway or beyond -- its earliest success probably achieved
in 1813, when a proposal to demolish the old Brig o' Doon was drowned in
a clamour of protest.
The fifteenth century hump-backed bridge is the oldest attraction in
the recently designated Burns National Heritage Park, which Her Majesty
the Queen will visit on July 5 to officially open the Tam o' Shanter
Experience. And the keystone of its arch we remember not as the old
Kyle-Carrick boundary, but as the spot where Tam made good his escape
from the fair witch Cutty Sark in the tale that Burns considered his
masterpiece.
Replacing the old Land o' Burns Centre, on the site of the former
railway goods yard, the Tam o' Shanter Experience Visitor Centre is one
of the first fruits of next year's commemoration of the poet's death on
July 21, 1796. A 12-minute spectacular audio-visual interpretation of
the famous narrative poem is in store, preceded by ''Discover Burns''
the tried and tested 10-minute biography of the poet's 37[1/2] years.
In Burns's cottage a superb audio-visual affectionately tells the
story of young Robert's first seven years before the move to
neighbouring Mount Oliphant. We smile to see brought to life the waxwork
figure in the next room, as William Burnes endeavours to teach his
first-born the Parable of the Sower. Burnes senior, a devout man, wrote
his own manual of religious instruction. It is one of the treasures of
the adjacent museum, along with the verses of Tam o' Shanter and Auld
Lang Syne in the poet's own hand.
William Burnes is buried in the graveyard of Alloway Auld Kirk. On the
headstone (a copy of the original, which was damaged by
souvenir-hunters) is inscribed Robert's eloquent epitaph to ''the tender
father and the generous friend''. Burns's mother outlived her famous son
by 24 years.
By 1790 when Tam o' Shanter came to be composed, Kirk Alloway lay
abandoned and in a ruinous state -- contemporary prints show only
one-third or so of the roof timbers still in place. It was the ideal for
a tale of witchcraft. Dating from the early 1500s, the old kirk seems
very small to the modern eye, but in those far-off days the congregation
stood at worship.
Across the road, Alloway Parish Church (1858) has some fine stained
glass. One ornamental window commemorates the Ayrshire aviation pioneer,
David F McIntyre, whose bi-plane took part in the first flight over
Everest in 1933. Controversy surrounded the building of this fine Gothic
church, for it blocked the view of the Burns Monument approaching
visitors had enjoyed for 40 years.
The idea of a monument to Burns ''within his native country'' was
conceived by Alexander Boswell of Auchinleck, Member of Parliament and
Worshipful Depute Grand Master of the Most Ancient Lodge Kilwinning.
Boswell himself laid the foundation stone on January 25 1820. The
completion ceremony took place in 1823 on July 4, the anniversary of
Robert Burns's induction into St David's Lodge Tarbolton, but Boswell
did not live to see it. He had been killed in a duel the year before.
In the years following the '45 Rebellion the impoverished magistrates
of Ayr sold the lands of the Barony of Alloway. Huge sums of money were
to be lavished by wealthy men on the creation of the estates of Rozelle
and Belleisle. Burns's father was first attracted to Alloway by the
prospect of well-paid employment in the landscaping of these estates,
and feued 7[1/2] acres of Belleisle for his cottage and market garden.
In 1968 the Hamiltons of Rozelle House gave the mansion and estate to
the people of Ayr ''for cultural and recreational purposes''. The stable
block is now an art gallery, a Henry Moore sculpture reclines in the old
stable yard and the mansion houses a permanent exhibition of local
history and municipal regalia. In the magnificent grounds are a variety
of exotic trees, some so ancient that they have to be held in shape by
steel ropes.
Belleisle tends to mean golf. The championship course is arguably the
finest local authority parkland course in Scotland; the Seafield offers
an interesting mixture of parklands and links. Advance booking is
essential for both. Belleisle House, now a hotel, was built by a brother
of Hamilton of Rozelle. It has an interesting French connection,
permission having been obtained from the French authorities to reproduce
from the Palace of Versailles the Music Room and Marie Antoinette's
Boudoir, now the hotel's Fontainebleau Restaurant. In the foyer are much
admired wood carvings of scenes from Tam o' Shanter, four years' work by
local craftsman James Davidson.
It is 4[1/2] miles from Alloway to the church where the Burns family
worshipped, the Auld Kirk of Ayr, up the narrow Kirkgate from the High
Street. On the site of the former Grey Friars' Monastery and dating from
1655, the old church is still in use.
Under the arch of the lygate leading to the churchyard are stored two
heavy iron mortsafes used to protect fresh graves from the attentions of
body-snatchers. The Rev William Dalrymple of the Auld Kirk baptised the
infant Burns at Alloway the day after his birth.
A brass plaque in Sandgate, opposite Ayr Post Office, marks the spot
where once stood the house of Burns's tutor, John Murdoch. In 1733
Robert came to lodge with Murdoch for three weeks and attended Ayr
Grammar School where Murdoch had been appointed English master. Three
years later Murdoch had to leave Ayr. His tongue loosened by drink, he
had uttered ill-judged words against the Rev Dalrymple. He was to die in
London at an advanced age in much reduced circumstances.
John Murdoch had only been 18 years of age when he was chosen by
William Burnes to educate his children. The young man was interviewed
for the job in Simpson's Inn at the north end of the Auld Brig of Ayr
where the stagecoach left for Glasgow. Today it goes by the name of the
Black Bull.
In the early years of this century, the Auld Brig -- having
comfortably seen off the challenge of its younger rival in 1886 -- held
a special place in the affections of Ayr people, but was itself at last
showing signs of infirmity. The civil engineers recommended demolition
and the building of ''a copy'' of the ancient bridge, as old as the town
itself.
Public opinion revolted. An international appeal was launched to raise
privately the necessary #10,000 and three years later the hero of The
Brigs Of Ayr was as good as new. The pen of Burns had done its work
again.

FURTHER signs that growth in the economy is slowing comes from two
surveys published today showing that the decline in the rate of business
failures is becoming less marked, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Year-on-year figures from Trade Indemnity show that business failures
notified to the credit insurance company were down 9% in the second
quarter, against a 19% fall in the opening quarter of the year.
It represents the sixth quarter that the rate of decline has slowed.
Failures in the second quarter, according the business information
group Dun &amp; Bradstreet, actually increased by 11% compared with the
first quarter to 11,033.
In comparison with last year the long-term trend is still down, with
first-half failures 10.6% lower.
Scotland remains the part of Britain most affected by business
failures, though this partly reflects changes in the bankrupty laws
which caused a small fall in 1994. Failures were 35% higher at 2060.
William Simpson, chief economist at Trade Indemnity, commented: ''The
pace of improvement in the economy has clearly slowed during 1995.
''We have identified three reasons for this slowdown -- manufacturers'
profits are coming under pressure from higher raw material and import
costs that are not being accommodated by similar rates of monetary
growth; weakness at the retail level is coming back to manufactuers in
reduced orders and, thirdly European and American retail sluggishness
will also intensify international competition.''
Dun &amp; Bradstreet says the London area has seen an increase of 22% in
failures in the first half of the year.
Senior analyst Philip Mellor commented: ''The increase in company
liquidations, particularly in London, is worrying because this seems to
be part of an accelerating process which started at the beginning of the
year . . . as yet smaller businesses have not been affected.''

AT the formidable age of 87, French violinist Stephane Grappelli could
reasonably be expected to have slowed down a little. The jazz life is
not normally conducive to health and longevity. But Grappelli remains in
every sense formidable, the twinkle in his eye and the acid jazz
iridescence of his shirt and waistcoat underlining the fact that his
style, his technique and his joie de vivre remain gloriously intact.
Grappelli's music has changed little since his partnership with Django
Reinhardt in the Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s, when the
duo forged the first wholly convincing European jazz perspective -- a
fleet-fingered, blissful confection of carbaret chanson and Broadway
show tunes, where thematic embellishment was more important than
extended harmonic improvisation.
Accompanied with great verve and sensitivity by Marc Fosset on guitar
(more Charlie Christian and Wes Montgomery than Reinhardt) and Jean
Philippe Viret on double bass, Grappelli took his delighted audience
through a 90-minute reprise of his back catalogue, the great hits of
Gershwin and Porter sounding as fresh as if they were written yesterday.
For the final 15 minutes, the trio were joined by the superb
Reinhardt-like Belgian guitarist Fapy Lapertin, coincidentally and
fortuitously in the city, kicking off with the old Hot Club favourite
Sweet Georgia Brown.
Even with the full complement of fingers and thumbs, Lapertin is not
quite in the same league as the digitally-challenged Reinhardt, but when
you closed your eyes you were back in Montaparnasse 60 years ago,
sipping absinthe and rapping with Cocteau. A magical evening.

OK, it's early days yet, but it could well be that one of the
highlights of this year's jazz festival is actually a folk festival gig.
In the adman's vogue for things Reinhardt, Lafertin stands out as a
phenomenal exponent of the great guitarist's style: forget your Renault
Clios, this was music for Mercs. His playing, although apparently
effortless, was dazzling and passionate -- and no mere impersonation.
Equally impressive was Steve Ellsworth, whose fiddle solos were -- as
Stephane Grappelli's were to Reinhardt -- the perfect complement. His
playing on Minor Swing was red-hot and by Viper's Dream (two tunes
later), the strings must have been sizzling.
The programme dipped in and out of the Hot Club repertoire, but all
the numbers were characterised by that band's cheery twenties Gallic
charm: from Walter Donaldson's zithery and instantly smile-inducing I've
Had My Moments, via a spicy Mexican tune and the lovely lament Vous Qui
Me Passez Sans Me Voir through to the encore medley which should have
been titled The Sheik of Araby Meets The Third Man.
But the real five-star stand-outs were the lightning-fast version of I
Wonder Where My Baby Is Tonight and Putting On the Ritz; and the
sumptuous serenade, Melody at Crepuscule. One of the numbers almost
summed the night up: C'est Si Bon. More like merveilleux, I'd say.

THE economy is heading for a ''soft landing'' -- steady, sustainable
growth with low inflation -- but interest rates need to rise again, a
leading group of economists say in a report today.
After growing rapidly last year, the economy will expand more slowly
in 1995 and 1996 with gross domestic product expected to increase by 3%
and 2.4% respectively, according to the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club's latest
forecast, based on the Treasury's computer model of the economy.
Meanwhile, the Government's benchmark measure of inflation, excluding
mortgage interest payments, should remain in its 1%-4% target range. But
there is a significant risk that rising costs in industry could filter
through to retail prices despite the sluggishness of consumer spending,
said the ITEM Club.
''In order to address this risk ITEM feels it would be prudent to
increase interest rates to 7.25% (from 6.75%) by the autumn.
''While this should not place too large a cost in terms of output, it
could help avert the need for larger increases at a later date should
inflation begin to accelerate excessively,'' according to the forecast.
ITEM said it is increasingly evident that the Government intends to
cut taxes in November's budget to win votes in the next general
election, assumed to take place in the autumn of 1996.
But it warns that, although politically expedient, tax cuts may not be
''financially prudent''. ''We do not expect the Government to be able to
meet its ambitious spending plans over the lead-up to a general election
which will leave the public sector borrowing requirement standing at
#4000m higher than the forecast by the Treasury in its latest summer
forecast,'' said ITEM's chief economist Paul Droop.

CONTROVERSIAL American tennis player Jeff Tarango, who stormed out of
a Wimbledon match in a blaze of anger and accusations on Saturday,
yesterday met tournament referee Alan Mills for an hour.
But details of the fine to be imposed -- probably a five figure sum --
were not being announced until later, according to a Wimbledon
spokeswoman, who added that a decision on the amount was being made by
officials at the All-England Club last night.
''I will stay here until justice is done,'' vowed Tarango as he
returned to his London hotel. ''I don't regret what happened.''
It is understood there may have been difficulty in reaching all the
officials and individuals involved in the Court 13 rumpus.
But Tarango may have a strong argument against heavy disciplinary
action. Bruno Rebeuh awarded a code violation for an audible obscenity
against him when Californian Tarango merely responded to crowd taunts by
yelling ''shut up.'' Tarango will have argued that by no stretch of the
imagination can ''shut up'' be regarded as an obscenity.
Tarango walked out of his match against Alexander Mronz -- at 7-6, 2-1
to the German, who faces Andre Agassi on Centre Court today -- and
accused French umpire Rebeuh of corruption and favouritism. When he was
denied recourse to the supervisor, he told Rebeuh: ''You are the most
corrupt official in the game.''
The umpire has been given the go-ahead to continue, but Tarango has
been banished along with his French wife, Benedicte, after a weekend
which surrendered the Championships to farce.
The 26-year-old player went to the meeting with Mr Mills with his
wife, who added injury to insult in unprecedented scenes at the club by
slapping the official in the face.
The nonsense reached another height yesterday when the Manchild
himself, John McEnroe, criticised Tarango's outburst. ''I just can't
believe he did that,'' said McEnroe, who was the bane of umpires.
McEnroe, who is commentating at the Championships for American
television network NBC, added: ''He has shot himself in the foot. I
never walked off court, I never wanted to be defaulted.''
Tarango snapped Wimbledon to attention after a first week of serve and
volley boredom. Then, when his wife stood up for her man and slapped
umpire Rebeuh, who the couple felt had been unfair, madness had arrived
back at sleepy hollow.
Mrs Tarango said yesterday she had no regrets over her actions and she
was fully supporting her husband. I don't regret anything. I am a little
hot-blooded but that is my Latin temperament.''
Tarango will be fined heavily and a ban on his participation in other
tournaments will also be imposed. Mrs Tarango can't be penalised
financially, but she can be be banned from courtside in future.
''I must admit I have said 'shut up' to the crowd before and not been
given a warning,'' McEroe added. ''I didn't think saying shut up was
profane.
''I have to say, though, I did find it funny the way his wife stood up
to the umpire. I thought that was a remarkable scene.''
Funny or not, there may also be legal implications and repercussions
for Tarango who alleged the umpire awarded matches out of friendship to
players and futher alleged that the Swiss player, Marc Rosset, seeded
10, was one who benefited in this manner.
Both umpire and Rosset, beaten first time out by Michael Joyce, could
consider having their names cleared in court. However, Tarango claims he
can substantate his claims if necessary.
Mr Rebeuh said last night that he would not be making any comment
about the scandal or whether he would be taking legal action until after
the end of the championships. He said: ''I am not going to say anything
until after my last day at Wimbledon. I just want to finish the
tournament and then after that I may be able to say something.''
The great British hope, Greg Rusedeski, is on the main court with the
defending champion, Pete Sampras, and the most remarkable thing about
the Canuck, apart from his peculiar desire to be British, is that he is
being given a chance.
Canadian-born Rusedski, who now considers himself as British as fish
and chips, said: ''The public have been brilliant. They have been full
of encouragement. I feel a great warmth from them.
''They have accepted me and consider me British.''
No less an authority than former Wimbledon champion Stan Smith, who
beat Nastase in a thrilling five-set final 23 years ago, believes the
big guy is a threat. ''Anyone who serves with his power has to have a
chance at Wimbledon, where left-handers always seem to do well,'' he
said.
Boris Becker rumbles on, but not with the old panache, and he wll have
to be extremely wary out on Court 2, the graveyard of the seeds, when he
plays against that long strip of nonsense with a huge serve, 6ft 8in
Dick Norman, who has already seen off two former champions, Pat Cash and
Stefan Edberg. Becker does not want to become third victim of the
unknown Belgian.

WEST End impresario Cameron Mackintosh and publisher John Madejski top
the pay league for directors of growing private companies with around
#4m each, according to a book published today.
Profits at Mr Mackintosh's theatrical production company nearly
doubled to more than #14m in the last trading year, enabling him and two
fellow directors to share #11.3m.
Mr Madejski's Hurst Publishing, which publishes Auto Trader, also
virtually doubled profits to just below #10m. He shared a payout of
#7.8m with another director.
The figures come from the 10th edition of the Brown Shipley Growth
Companies Register, which tracks the 2000 fastest-growing private
companies.
''The overall trading performance of the top 2000 companies shows
spectacular improvements over the previous year as this important
section of British industry has moved strongly out of recession,'' said
publisher Roy Assersohn.
''Nearly 1000 companies doubled their profits, compared with only 500
in the previous edition in 1994.''

AS the sun went down on Friday night, the summer feeling continued in
the City Cafe Bar as the Annie Whitehead Experience took to the stage
with their own brand of jazz.
Kicking off with The Culprit, a moody piece with an early sixties
filmic feel to it, the band quickly established its cross-genre
dexterity.
Hello Max, written with Harry Becket, was reggae influenced in a
friendly sunsplash-kinda-way, affording Whitehead the opportunity to
display some roaring trombone lines.
Three songs in, Whitehead announced the end of the first set,
promising a much longer second. But during the interval, she appeared on
stage asking if anyone had a trombone. It seemed a tall order, but this
is a jazz festival after all, and the Berklee bound Scottish player
Nichol Thomson gallantly nipped home and got his.
The Experience sound owes much to Whitehead's love of world music and
as a band, the players really excelled on a blues inflected piece,
with some neat playing by Jasper Von t'Hof on keyboards and slap bass
from Dudley Philips. His walking lines combined with Maidman's strolling
blues riffs, creating a wholly satisfying interplay while the vociferous
Genockey ensured they kept up with his own searing pace.

AFTER years as a Jazzfest favourite on the pub circuit, Saturday night
saw Joe Locke graduate to (in his own words) the big room. The
flamboyant vibraphonist admitted to being nervous, although this may
have had more to do with the suit he was wearing than the size of the
venue. It was one of the most sartorially-challenged outfits I've seen
since 1986. Happily, his taste in attire was not reflected in his
musical offerings.
Featured guest for the night was saxophonist Tommy Smith. It
transpires that the pair have been spending a bit of time together, and
the empathy that has grown between them, resulted in an inspired
improvisational playfulness. Smith was in fine form, creating sheets of
sound and playing with a warm lyricism, best heard on his own haunting
composition Memorial, based on the poem by Norman McCaig. Surely one of
the saddest tunes ever written.
Elsewhere, particularly on Andrew Hill's Tripping, we heard some
terrific ensemble playing; Alex Dankworth on bass, and the particularly
impressive New Yorker Joe Caldorazzo (sitting in for Cindy Blackman on
drums) who kept the quartet pieces moving along at a furious pace. Solo,
Locke embraced technology, creating haunting, impressionistic
soundscapes from mystical keyboard and percussion sound effects.
The encore saw Smith and Locke take to the stage for a duo piece; a
futuristic sci-fi soundtrack fantasy which would not have been out of
place in Blade Runner.
The gig, however, remained strangely unengaging, which was
disappointing, given Locke's legendary ability to charm audiences.
Perhaps he was genuinely nervous in finding himself promoted to the big
room.

PLAYERS like saxist Julian Arguelles make you long for a time when a
definable jazz ''scene'', in which talents like his -- at home in any
company and extraordinary in most -- would be properly appreciated. His
current quartet -- the live incarnation has brother Steve on drums and
bassist Steve Watts -- teams him with guitarist Mike Walker, who has
played in recent years with Tommy Smith and the George Russell
Orchestra, and they are an amazing partnership.
The duo's unison playing in 500 Broadway -- a tune named for the
address of the saxist's New York digs -- defined the evening, even if it
was often Walker who won the real acclaim of the punters for his
explosive soloing and wide range of expression. If that tune was
Arguelles' impressionistic response to the Big Apple, the first set
closer, Which Way Out, was pure NYC funk and a showcase for the
artist-formerly-known-as side of Walker's musical personality.
The saxophonist's writing style is impossible to define. Third
Escapade owed a debt to Mike Gibbs, while Hix -- featuring the leader on
soprano sax -- dallied in Ornette Coleman territory. A Month in Tunisia
(characteristically introduced by Arguelles in a way that made sure the
joke was not wasted) contained only the merest nod towards its titual
be-bop inspiration, and rather more of the African influence that is
detectable in much of his composition. On another piece he played two
flutes while Walker demonstrated that highlife guitar was also part of
his repertoire.
It all suited the sun-baked party atmosphere of the festival's opening
weekend -- so what did the quartet encore with? In the Bleak Midwinter.
No, really. And superbly arranged and movingly played it was.

A GUIDE as to whether or not there has been any upturn in consumer
confidence and with it retail spending will come this week from results
from three leading retailers.
Today, John Menzies reports its annual results. Bell Lawrie White is
expecting these to show a small increase in taxable profit from #34.4m
to around #38.2m.
The High Street retail business is forecast to make a small profit of
perhaps #1m compared with a loss in 1993-94, still an inadequate return
on sales and capital. Flat operating profits are expected from the Early
Learning Centre business which is being steadily rolled out in a
superstore format.
MFI is also reporting annual profits today with the City forecasting a
drop from #87.8m to #65m. The group has found it difficult to pass on
higher raw material prices to its customers in the difficult retail
environment.
There is expected to be a more upbeat trading statement from brewer
Scottish &amp; Newcastle. NatWest Securities is forecasting profits up from
#222m to #265m, helped by the Chef &amp; Brewer pubs acquisition.
Investors will be interested to hear of the company's plans for the
integration of Courage, recently acquired from Foster's. A decision by
the OFT is expected next month on whether the deal, making S&amp;N's
Britain's largest brewer, will be referred to the MMC.
There are no major companies reporting results tomorrow, but on
Wednesday, Dixons is expected to show the benefit of a margin recovery.
Goldman Sachs expects a 31% increase in profits to #96m. Last year's
results were hit by exceptional charges which led to a pre-tax loss of
#165m.
The shares have enjoyed a strong run in recent times with many in the
City taking the view that the fundamentals of the business have improved
dramatically.
Over the last six months, the resolution of the OFT investigation into
extended warranties, the withdrawal of a number of major players, the
weak performance of rival Comet, the number two in the market, and the
growth in demand for home computers have all improved the trading
picture.
On the same day, flushed with success from the #800m acquisition of
Trident submarine manufacturer VSEL, GEC reports its finals. Rising
research and development costs on the Eurofighter 2000 and the Boeing
777 are thought to have depressed second-half profitability.
However, Natwest Securities is forecasting a #68m rise in profits to
#934m. There may be some exceptional charges for rationalisation and
problem contracts. The City will also be looking for any hint of a bid
for British Aerospace.
Thursday is a quiet day for results announcements but on Friday
attention will centre on Britain's biggest jeweller, Signet Group,
formerly Ratners. The group has forecast that that it will make pre-tax
profits of around #8m, up from #1.7m before provisions on losses from
disposals in 1993-94.
Signet is battling to rebuild profits after the recession and
over-expansion. However, it is saddled with #360m of debt and has #130m
of arrears on its Preference dividends.
There is also speculation that the catalogue showroom retailer Argos,
which has about 8% of the UK jewellery market, may want to buy Signet's
UK's businesses which trade under the Hill Samuel and Ernest Jones brand
names.

WELL, they were there in their thousands on Saturday night for the
Royal SNO's Last Night of the Proms, balloons at the ready,
party-poppers loaded, the auditorium full, the arena packed like a
sardine can. But it took a Sousa march and a pair of polka-dot boxer
shorts in the second half to get the crowd roaring and jumping.
Not that it was the orchestra's fault that it took so long. They were
demob happy and primed for anarchy from the outset, as conductor Owain
Arwel Hughes -- sporting a recent injury -- hobbled onstage on crutches
to a chorus of Long John Silver impersonations from the band.
''It's all English music,'' said one patron in an explanation of the
sedate behaviour of the mob through first-half performances of music by
Arnold, Vaughan Williams, and Walton. And even though the
Whistlebinkies, in a guest spot with some very fine Celtic music, got
the feet tapping, their sound had neither its proper size nor immediacy
in the giant auditorium.
Second half -- principal trombonist Lance Green came on in his
underwear and stuffed a balloon in Philip Hore's tuba. Out came the
funny hats and the band blew the hell out of Stars and Stripes Forever.
From then on it was straight up the home strait, with Khatchaturian
sabre-rattling, Jeremy Randalls's Ceilidh, a compendium of Scots tunes
and reels, and an eloquent plea for support for the orchestra in its
winter season from conductor Hughes.
Incidentally, RSNO followers should note that the orchestra's new
winter season is being launched this week. Get The Herald on Wednesday.
* Concert sponsored by the Bank of Scotland.

* THERE was an unadvertised change of personnel on the bandstand
during the Joe Locke gig on Saturday night. American drummer Cindy
Blackman had a good reason for her absence. Lenny Kravitz, apparently,
has first call on the drummer, and he decided that he wanted her for his
forthcoming tour.
As the Jazz Festival recovers from a weekend of indulgence, choices of
what to hear become simpler. In the McEwan's Old Fruitmarket 7.30pm slot
tonight is Paul Motian's Broadway Music outfit. Their self-imposed remit
is to resurrect and re-interpret standards from the great Broadway
musicals.
Over at McChuills pub on the High Street, at 8.30pm, the Scottish
women's group Engender is hosting a night of ''Women in Jazz''.
Back at the McEwan's Old Fruitmarket at 10pm, Chicago's young
trumpeter Robert Mazurek will be introducing Glaswegians to his blend of
hard and hot bop, with the help of his band -- Eric Alexander (sax),
Randy Tressler (piano), John Webber (bass) and George Fludas (drums).

I'VE already highlighted the last week of September in my diary --
that's when Rambert are in Glasgow, at the King's. Three of the reasons
I'm looking forward to seeing the company again soon are contained in
the programme that rounded off their performances at the Edinburgh
Festival Theatre last week.
This really was a treat of a triple bill, a well judged blend of wit,
drama, powerful emotions, and tongue-in-cheek fun that ably bore out
Christopher Bruce's contention that dance can be popular with a wide
ranging audience without any dilution of standards or ideas.
The ideas behind his own piece, Swansong, are in part a response to
Oriana Fallaci's novel A Man in which brutal interrogations of a
political prisoner take on a kind of heightened theatricality. This
element of showmanship Bruce tellingly translates into vaudeville dance
-- suddenly the rat-a-ta-tat of tap dance, the swaggering panache
attached to using a cane, take on an unexpectedly menacing edge.
Simon Cooper and Christopher Powney tap and shuffle with an ease that
is brilliantly, subtly sinister while Ted Stoffer -- the fall guy in the
chair -- brings an aching intensity to the lonely visions of flight that
intersperse bouts of fiercely athletic ''questioning''. Like an earlier
work of Bruce's, Ghost Dances, this is dance with a conscience --
eloquent, compassionate and crafted with integrity.
Another able craftsman is Mark Baldwin, whose Banter Banter opened the
programme. Bright, confident movement full of conversational gesture and
flirty humour -- set to energising Stravinsky rhythms -- it was neatly
balanced by Bruce's Rooster, a deliciously sassy evocation of the
generation who strutted (in flares and kipper ties) to the sounds of the
Stones. Absolutely ace -- not to be missed when the company make their
welcome return to Scotland in the autumn.

THE Scottish jazz scene has never been so rich in bands as it is
currently and this two-day event certainly proved the quality of the
product available. It's just a pity that this message never got through
to the public as attendances were uniformly thin.
I don't pretend to have the answer, although #5 tickets for bands who
can be seen either free or for half that price in clubs might have
something to do with it, but this is something the jazz festival will
surely want to look at in future.
The other problem is keeping all these bands working. The Spontaniacs,
though well-rehearsed and brilliantly marshalled by Des Travis's
precise, stylish drumming, lacked the freedom of movement within their
arrangements that comes with steady live performances.
In contrast, Chick Lyall's quintet, playing a not dissimilar, if less
self-consciously arty style of electric jazz used their tunes as a
jumping off point for some exciting solos from Lyall (keyboards),
saxophonist Phil Bancroft and guitarist Morph.
Pianist Steve Hamilton's trio reduced the heat but maintained a high
level of creativity with both original tunes and an unusual choice of
covers.
Leading a band seemed to weigh heavily on Robert Henderson. The
trumpeter, a dependably fiery and imaginative sideman, didn't play as he
can. But his specially commissioned compositions, particularly his
dedication to fellow trumpeter, the late Lee Morgan, captured the late
1950s/early 1960s hard-bop spirit to perfection.
Less easily pinned down stylistically, Mike Travis's EH15 closed the
weekend with another assured stride through a mix of African influences,
reggaefied blues and Spanish flavours that keeps getting better every
time I hear it.

DEEDEE CUDDIHY looks at links between food and relationships
DOES marriage change our eating habits? That's the question a team of
researchers from Glasgow and Edinburgh universities are going to be
concentrating on over the next year or so.
Apparently, ''eating together is central to living together and in the
early stages of marriage or cohabiting, the eating habits of two
individuals are changing to become the eating habits of a couple''.
The researchers claim that the results of their study ''may ultimately
help people buy and choose food wisely and well''.
Who knows? But what is certain about the results is that, jargon
permitting, they're bound to make fascinating reading.
Although the universities' team is concentrating on first-time
cohabitees (married or otherwise), the whole business of just how much
control we have over our eating habits and how they change throughout
life is ripe for discussion and research.
On the face of it, it could be argued that mothers have total control
over what their children eat. But I have one child who seemed so
determined, from birth, that he was not going to be breastfed, that I
eventually had to give up and put him on to bottles. Since then we've
had such ferocious battles over numerous foods that I've now got to the
stage where I don't care what he eats (usually doughnuts and carry-out
chips with far too much tomato sauce), as long as he's getting enough
calories.
His sister, on the other hand, took to the breast like a seasoned
professional and is willing to have a go at most things including
creamed tuna fish and other dishes which don't look too promising but
actually taste quite nice (honest).
And what about school dinners, hospital food, canteen meals and other
institutional fare? Does exposure to all that alter our eating habits?
The researchers will have more than enough on their plates with newly
cohabiting, heterosexual couples (the sample of 45 pairs is, apparently,
too small to include gay people). For, as they state: ''In marriage,
food and meals have significant, symbolic functions which affect the
choice of food, its preparation, the way it is served and how it is
eaten. The role of gender in taking decisions and performing tasks is
crucial to our understanding of marital relationships.''
There is certainly no doubt in my mind that eating habits change when
you start living with someone. I distinctly remember, pre-cohabitation,
that my evening meal usually consisted of tinned tomato soup, cheddar
cheese and salad. Then, within hours of moving out of my flat and into
his, I found myself looking down a chicken's backside and feeling more
than a little uneasy about the prospect of roasting it.
I have a friend who, when her marriage broke up a few years ago, said
she only realised the relationship was in danger when her husband became
physically violent. However, I now recall that, some time before then,
he had begun rejecting the meals she made and latterly was buying and
preparing all his own food. Maybe that, and not the violence, was the
first sign of a marriage going down hill.
The researchers are still looking for volunteer couples to take part
in the project. You'll be doing them a favour and you get to talk about
yourself and what you eat -- all in complete confidence, at a time and
place to suit you.
Couples who will be interviewed by Deborah Kemmer just before they
move in together and again three months afterwards, must be childless
and be embarking on a first marriage or cohabitation some time this
year.
For further information, contact Doctor Kemmer on 0141 304 4686 or
0131 228 1484.

LESLEY DUNCAN finds it's now easy to get back to her roots
I'VE been digging up old family Bones. No macabre sorties to
graveyards were involved. Rather the location was that most handsome of
Glasgow enclaves, Park Circus. Here Strathclyde Regional Council's new
wedding suites are housed in the splendid terraced building that used to
be the Casa d'Italia. On the top floor, above the nuptual salons, is a
room kitted out with computer screens. These are the technological tools
for Strathclyde's new genealogy service. It will allow West of Scotland
residents to explore their family trees without having to go to Register
House, Edinburgh.
For the fee of #12 visitors can book a day's research, using visual
display units to trace information stored on microfilm or microfiche.
Two users share a link to the index of national records in Edinburgh.
Although this lists only names and dates, without giving details of
addresses and occupations, it gives basic information on every birth,
death, and marriage registered in Scotland. This in turn is a useful
tool for delving into microfiche showing all the entries made in the
area covered by Strathclyde Region since civil registration was
introduced in 1855. Pre-1955 Church of Scotland parish registers, which
listed most of the baptism, marriage proclamations, and burials in their
areas, can also be consulted.
A caveat about the last. ''These records are only as good as the
session clerks in each area!'' counsels Bill Craig, depute chief
registrar for Glasgow, who had kindly offered to guide me through the
intricacies of research.
There's a further bank of information available in microfilm records
of the census taken every 10 years from 1841 to 1891. It gives details
about households (enabling the tracing of siblings) as well as the
names, ages, occupations, marital status and parish of birth of everyone
listed.
All this is most impressive in theory. Now to put it to the test. I
start off with certain advantages. Ancestors on both sides of the family
-- with known Ayrshire and Paisley connections -- almost certainly all
lived within the geographical boundaries of Strathclyde for the last 200
years .
I've decided, however, to pursue one of my own middle names. This is
Bone -- my maternal grandmother's maiden name. Needless to say, it was
the cause of much leg-pulling when I was at school. Only when I reached
my late teens did I realise it had a certain kudos. For my grandmother
had been some sort of cousin to the celebrated Bone brothers who
included the war artist and etcher Muirhead Bone; David, novelist and
commodore of the Anchor Line; and James, London editor of the then
Manchester Guardian.
I start with myself. There's a slight hiccup because my baptismal
first name (Elisabeth) has been recorded with a Z rather than an S. My
full baptismal data is there pulled up on microfiche. From there we
pursue my father, because his surname, Munn, is less common than my
mother's, Stevenson.
We find my parents' marriage details, and from that my mother's age
and her parents' names. My grandparents' marriage is soon found and then
again, using the lever of my grandmother's age at marriage, her birth
information, and then her parents' marriage -- 1859 at St Quivox Church,
Ayr. I now have the name of my great-great-grandfather -- James, also a
coalminer, and his wife, another Elizabeth, who has, sadly, an illegible
surname.
In less than an hour I have traced this branch of my family back to
the 1830s. Lunch obtrudes. The link with the Bone brothers is still to
be made. But I've gleaned from The Dictionary of National Biography that
Muirhead Bone's father, David Drummond Bone, came from Ayr and probably
married within the same decade as my great-grandfather. Another session
will be sure to crack the Bones. That leaves only the Stevensons and
McCullochs, the Munns and Tainshes, and a few other surnames forbye, for
future sleuthing.
The combination of the uncommon name and Bill Craig's expert
assistance have made my introductory exploration unusually swift. Not
that difficulties will daunt members of the public such as Agnes Murray.
She emigrated to Canada in 1955 and is now back in Scotland from London,
Ontario, looking into both sides of her family tree. ''I've got back to
1850 and the marriage of my great-great-grand father,'' she announces
with satisfaction.
Strathclyde's pilot genealogy service can accommodate six researchers
at the same time. There will be a review after six months and the
possibility of doubling that number.

<HEADLINE>Conflicts still simmering away. The politics of milk</HEADLINE>

IT was a senior Nestle executive who last year described how he used
to regard milk as ''wet white stuff'' which he bought as basic raw
material.
Deregulation has changed all of that and much more attention is being
paid to the composition of milk and to the price which processors are
prepared to pay producers for that basic raw material.
The Scottish Milk Marketing Board has gone and there is keen interest
in the prices paid to farmers by its partial successor, Scottish Milk,
and by private operators such as Wiseman or Nestle who are now free to
make their own contractual arrangements with producers.
People speak of the politics of milk and the indications are that
deregulation has not made the scene any less political.
A hint at some of the conflicts still simmering away was given at the
annual meeting of the residual board which is charged with the
responsibility over the next five years of winding up the affairs of the
former SMMB.
Scottish Pride, formerly the manufacturing arm of the board and now a
public limited company in its own right, is regarded with suspicion by
many of its dairy farmer/shareholders who fear that the company's desire
to be an efficient modern business may run contrary to their interests
as dairy farmers.
Scottish Pride's ambitions, they suspect, lie in screwing down the
cost of its raw material -- milk. If these fears prove justified will
the money they receive in dividends on their shares compensate for a
less-than-expected figure on the milk cheque?
It is these fears which have led to the formation of a shareholders'
association which is determined to raise its concerns at the company's
first annual general meeting later this month.
The interim-chairman of that grouping was Tom Reid, vice-convener of
the National Farmers' Union of Scotland Milk Committee, until it was
explained to him that there was a possible conflict of interest. He has
stepped down from the shareholders' grouping.
The possible conflict of interest became a reality on Friday of last
week when the milk committee decided to give its support to the Scottish
Pride board and advised shareholders to vote against the five
resolutions submitted by the shareholders' association for the company's
annual meeting.
It has become clear that the NFUS is anxious to maintain its sphere of
influence in the milk sector and does not regard Scotttish Pride as just
another company with whom some of its members do business. The union's
milk committee will not to support ''any action which might destabilise
the company'' during this first year of its development.
It invited both the dissident shareholders and Scottish Pride to be
represented at the specially convened meeting of the milk committee,
although the shareholders' grouping declined.
John Ross, national president of the NFUS, attended a meeting of milk
producers in Ayr last week to press home the point that the union very
much wants to be part of any discussions on milk. Concern over milk
prices was one of the causes which led to the formation of the union 80
years ago. That concern is not fading. ''If there are any problems,
bring them here,' John Scott, president of the Ayr area executive, has
told his members.
Michael McReath, secretary of the Scottish Pride shareholders'
association insists, however, that he and his 200 co-signatories have
done nothing wrong in putting forward critical resolutions for the
Scottish Pride meeting. The best way forward, he sees, is for the
resolutions to be voted on. That will give an indication of how much
support there is for the stance taken by the association members.
There is, of course, logic in all the arguments. Shareholders
obviously have a right to express concerns about their company, as they
did recently with great public acceptance, at British Gas.
Scottish Pride directors, naturally, have a responsibility to run the
company as effectively as possible in the interests of the shareholders
-- but they will presumably look at the shareholders' interests as
shareholders and not as suppliers of the raw material.
The union argues that it exists to protect the economic and political
interests of its members -- including its dairy farmer members -- which
it obviously interprets as not undermining one of the major players this
early in the post-deregulation game.
It is a situation which needs handling with kid gloves. It may be one
of the first hot potatoes to land in the lap of the NFU's new director
of public affairs and communications, if the union's council decides to
go ahead with such an appointment.
The recent surge of adverse publicity on animal welfare has caused the
union to review its communications procedures in the wake of complaints
from members that the farmers' side of the story was not getting over to
the public. Chief executive Tom Brady has prepared a paper for
Wednesday's council meeting which outlines the need for improved
communications both internally and externally.
His proposals are soundly based, provided whoever is appointed to the
post does not see his or her role as the conduit for all communication
with with the union's leaders. Journalists will always prefer direct
contact.

WE had a glimpse of the future last week when Tony Blair and John
Major came to Cannes. Both had their media minders marching one step
behind them and both wielded carefully rehearsed soundbites. Indeed it
is becoming increasingly difficult these days to distinguish between
Blair and Major on European policy. Both are adept at news management, a
sinister but accurate enough phrase, first given to the world, I
believe, by officials in the Kennedy White House.
Getting to Major was the difficult part but the effort produced
another little victory which brings the latest score in the continuing
match between the Scottish press and the Whitehall machine to two-nil
for us.
Major was preparing his response to the news of the Redwood challenge
and agreed to meet British reporters on the Croisette in Cannes, where
he would say a few words, we were advised. But, it seems, when Number 10
talks of the British-only media, it means London-only.
This was to be a pool job with places for only 11 reporters, each
issued with a green badge of accreditation. The others were told they
could take a hike. My colleague from that Edinburgh rag and I were
included out.
Call me an old cynic, but it did seem strange there just happened to
be 11 Westminster lobby correspondents in town. A stushie ensued in
which demonstrations of the Glasgow kiss were promised. We won after
intervention by the Foreign Office team in Brussels, who understand
about our sensitivities on these matters.
Indeed, the brave chap who came to our rescue, again, must be bored to
death with them. But he proved he is one of us at heart. (His mum comes
from Bellshill.) Our greatest admiration, however, is reserved for one
hack -- who must remain anonymous -- who knew his chances of a green
card were nil but who needed to be there.
He scoured around for some green cardboard and black felt pen and
simply made his own. No-one rumbled him. This disgraceful forgery now
hangs on his office wall as a trophy. There was a time when enterprising
journalists like that were promoted and given a pay rise. Now they are
fired if the politicians' media minders complain.
Being Prime Minister (at the time of writing), Major has a battery of
media advisers. They will talk for hours about how wonderfully he
performed in negotiations, scoring lots of successes with his bulldog
determination to battle for Britain. What they don't tell you is, of
course, usually what their audience wants to know.
As always, Burns said it all:
Here's freedom to him who would read
Here's freedom to him who would write
There's nane ever feared
But the truth should be heard
But they whom the truth would indict.
If and when Major steps down, his media team will do the same for his
successor. Some of the key personalities will change if the governing
party changes, but the system will remain firmly in place.
Tony Blair is a dab hand at news management. His media trusty,
Alastair Campbell, is permanently at his side and destined to become the
Bernard Ingham of the Labour Party. I don't know whether Campbell's
relationship with Blair involves coaching, but there is no question that
when it comes to offering soundbites Tony Blair is almost ridiculously
determined.
At the socialist summit near Cannes, the British media were taken into
the garden where Blair appeared before them. Someone said they counted
seven questions to the Labour leader, all different, all on camera. The
trouble was that the seven replies to the seven different questions were
almost identical.
The Blair message that day was that the Tory leadership election was
damaging Britain. He said it every time, regardless. If you had asked
him if he fancied Queen of the South for the European Cup, he would have
replied that the Tory leadership election was damaging Britain. This
raises a neo-Orwellian concept: news programmes on the telly where
no-one asks questions. There would be no need because the political
parties would have already sent in their soundbites in advance. It would
matter not what viewers or newspaper readers actually wanted to know:
they would be told what politicians decide they must hear.
Most politicians are like Major and Blair. Douglas Hurd, elegant and
cultured, is an honourable exception. History might not be kind to Hurd
as Foreign Secretary, but no-one can deny he is an erudite and almost
poetic individual among less thoughtful men like Major.
Hurd loves conjuring phrases. He foresaw the grisly concept of the
''level killing field'' in Bosnia if the arms embargo was lifted; he
recalled Jacques Delors as the ''philosopher king in Brussels''. Hurd,
of course, is a writer in his spare time. Not for him the shameless,
glib soundbite. He would rather quote Shakespeare than struggle to
remember his media minder's script for the day.
Soundbite culture is having a curious effect on the general direction
of British policy in Europe. Blair and Major are in danger of becoming
indistinguishable. Telling who is saying what is confusing because the
same soundbites, with their need for simplicity, are becoming
attributable to either leader. This trend reached a new level of
precision when both Blair and Major talked about Britain ''at the heart
of Europe''.
For example, who do you think said: ''We will maintain the veto
vigorously in key areas.'' And who said: ''We shall not accept the end
of the national veto.'' Which Tory is the Tony? Well, not that it
matters much, the first was Blair last month in Bonn and the second Mr
Major in the Commons on March 1.
There are reams of speeches from both men on the issue of Europe. On
minor questions -- and the social chapter of Maastricht, which Labour
wants and the Tories don't, is a minor question if you consider its real
effect on working people -- there is some genuine difference of opinion.
Gradually, however, on the great issues such as the veto and the single
currency there is a convergence of soundbites (sorry, policies).
What will happen when Blair is in power is, of course, another matter.

A WEEK is a long time in farming . . . especially if it is a
longer-than-average week because of the holidays.
There was I complaining that we were at the fourth week of June
without getting a summer. Now we're enjoying a heatwave and the Farmer
has nothing to do but enjoy listening to the grass growing and the corn
filling.
And the grass is growing. The cattle are wading deep in the stuff and
those who made the later silage have full clamps.
The barley is filling at a rate which threatens to be embarrassing at
harvest time. In five days last week, it went from empty to a
half-decent grain size, and still filling. We've never had so much sun
at just the right time before so it's a case of ''brace yourself
banker'', again.
The rape doesn't look so good though. It is definitely shorter than in
recent years and I expect the yields to be down there.
But Mossie hasn't given up on his rape. He said it all depends on the
size of the pods and he's given it every encouragement. He's sown three
acres of garden peas in the setaside next to his rape and every day he
goes out and tells the rape: ''Watch what the peas do and do likewise.''
If you're wondering how it is that he is growing peas on land the
Government has paid him more than #100 an acre not to grow cash crops
on, the answer is that these peas are not a cash crop. Mossie and I are
going to eat the lot. He's sown them at fortnightly intervals and we
hope to have fresh garden peas to our hearts' content, right up to
Christmas.
This is the life for a king, surely!
And then again there have been little snags.
When I was spraying my setaside with round-up to get rid of the couch,
the sprayer didn't seem to be delivering properly. I kept increasing the
flow and yet the level in the tank never seemed to fall. Too late I
twigged it. There is a great lot of sticker in round-up and that makes
froth. When the stuff ran done I was left with the tank half-full of
froth and half a field still to spray.
And then there was the trouble I had with the calves' ear-tags. We've
given up on the single FASL jumbo tags because we can't get them to stay
in. It was embarrassing how often we had to change the numbers on the
cattle's passports. If Farm Assured Scottish Livestock was supposed to
increase consumer confidence those tags certainly weren't helping.
We've got a new set of the UK metal tags and the plan is to give them
a jumbo tag with the last numbers on it for easy identification. So a
calf gets a metal tag with UK AB 8283 00006 and a jumbo tag which just
says 6.
We thought it a good idea until I found a bull and a heifer both with
the number 6.
A willing horse is an irresistible gift especially when it is a gift
and doesn't require payment, but I knew exactly whose fault it was.
Potions had helped with the numbering of the calves.
We got them all in again and found the two number sixes. The heifer
was indeed number six but the bull . . . the one we had to get right for
the passports, should have been nine. It was Potions who wrote out the
numbers but he wasn't putting his hand up for the mistake.
''I definitely wrote the numbers out right. It must have been one of
the tags that was upside down?'' He should have been a lawyer.
Then there was my little faux pas at the Royal Highland Show.
Scottish Pride, which does some of the work formerly done by the
Scottish Milk Marketing Board, had the decency to invite us to take a
light lunch, and hear something of their trials and triumphs.
Lord Sanderson was in the chair and made a first-rate job of giving
the press what they were entitled to and no more. When the drink was
finished the press went off to their next conference and his lordship
went off to provide a ''photo-opportunity''.
The Breadwinner and I, having arrived late, and the Farmer being not
yet replete, were left with a nice lady who plied us unstintingly with
more coffee, more wholesome sandwiches and pleasant chat about this and
that.
I should have left it at that of course, but no. ''Have you been with
the board long?'' said the Farmer, like a neep.
''Oh, no,'' says the lady, kindly. ''I'm Russell's wife.''
So our hostess was Lady Sanderson.
I defend myself. Would I have looked a bigger fool if I'd asked a
waitress if she was Lady Sanderson?
Mossie had a quiet show. At least that's what his sweet, patient wife
thinks. Her reasoning is that he didn't appear to be ill when he came
home after his two days away with the boys.
In fact, he came home inspired. Next year he and Butcher Bain plan to
sell barbecued beef from the converted muckspreader.
They had a triumph in Aberdeen the other day. It was the 500th
birthday of the university and they sold 12 sirloins as ''steak in a
bun'' in four hours. Every time the queue got below 10 yards long Mossie
gave the old muckspreader a kick spilling some of the fat from the trays
into the fire. The explosion of reek and fire turned every head for
half-a-mile and the queue was soon up to 20 yards or more.
''That's marketing,'' said the butcher, ''give her anither kick,
Mossie.''
And, of course, Mossie's been insufferable since, ''Oh, aye,'' he
keeps saying. ''I've been to the university, ye ken.''

SAUDI businessmen Prince al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdul-Aziz is
preparing a bid for Canary Wharf, the London office development that
once symbolised the collapse of Britain's 1980s property boom, market
sources said yesterday.
They said that there were no other partners involved and that the bid
needed no outside financing as it would be backed by the prince's own
funds.
''He is now leading the list of bidders for Canary Wharf,'' said one
source.
The bid pits the prince against a consortium assembled by Paul
Reichmann that is trying to regain control of the development which in
1992 sent his Olympia &amp; York into administration as commercial property
prices plunged.
The market sees the bid by Prince al-Waleed, who owns nearly 25% of
Euro Disney and is Citicorp's largest single shareholder, in a
favourable light because, unlike Reichmann, he had no previous
involvement in the project.
Canary Wharf is now owned by an 11-bank syndicate headed by Lloyds
Bank, which pulled the east end dockside site out of administrative
receivership in 1993. The syndicate includes Barclays, Citicorp,
Commerzbank and Credit Suisse.
A spokeswoman for Lloyds would not comment on any specific bids but
confirmed a number of interests had been expressed. She said that no
sale prospectus had been produced and that all offers so far had been
unsolicited.
Though Canary Wharf was seen as a disaster after its financial
collapse, market sentiment has been changing recently. The huge
development, visible for miles around and now a London landmark, has
attracted a succession of high-profile businesses.
Investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd is based there and the complex
has become the new ''Fleet Street'' with several newspapers, including
the Daily Mirror and Daily Telegraph, working out of the east London
site.
Prince al-Waleed, a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, has
specialised in making seemingly doomed ventures turn a profit. He has
taken stakes in and merged several failing firms in Saudi Arabia and
turned them into profitable ventures.
He is currently leading a consortium involved in talks to buy part of
former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest media
empire.
At 37 years old and a multi-billionaire, Prince al-Waleed is chairman
of United Saudi Commercial Bank and also counts among his global
holdings a 25% stake in the Toronto-based Four Seasons Hotels Inc. --

THE investment trust trade association has called on the Government to
exempt investors in school fee plans from the Inland Revenue's plan to
change the tax regime on gilts and zero dividend capital shares.
The Revenue is proposing that capital gains on gilts and zeros should
be taxed as income. Zeros rise in value by a specified percentage each
year and at present this is counted as capital gain and taxed
accordingly. They are often used in school fee plans where it is
necessary to have a particular capital sum available at a certain date.
''A large number of private shareholders have invested in good faith
under the existing tax rules to meet future spending commitments such as
school fees and retirement provision,'' said Ernest Fenton, director
general of the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC). ''I
thought the Government wished to encourage self-help, not penalise it.
To change the rules retrospectively would hit these people hard.''
The AITC has also objected to the changes in gilt taxation which it
says would result in double taxation on gilts and bonds held by
investment trusts. Around #5500m is invested in gilts and bonds by the
industry.

IN A hilarious article in the current issue of the British Journalism
Review, the great Hugh Cudlipp discloses some 65-year-old secrets about
his graduation as a cub reporter in Blackpool. It was there, at the
tender age of 17, that he took his degree in street wisdom, with honours
in what he describes as ''creative journalism''.
When he arrived in Blackpool as a district reporter for the Manchester
Evening Chronicle, the young Cudlipp had already seen some life -- and
attempted death, having had to use his Boy Scout knife to cut down an
editor who had tried suicide with the cord of the window blind after
learning of the impending closure of his newspaper.
On the famous Front, amid the Kiss-me-Quick paper hats of 1930, he was
to be provided with a further introduction to the realities of survival
in the newspaper industry: his news editor reminded him every Monday
morning of the need for ''something the others haven't got''. By means
of creative journalism, Cudlipp gave it to them. ''Creative
journalism,'' he writes, ''is the art of causing something to occur that
would not otherwise materialise and is worthy of record in a newspaper;
making news, not faking news.'' How different, how very different, to
the kind of creative journalism so widely practised today.
If that sounds pompous, it is unintentional. It so happened that I was
reading Lord Cudlipp's article on Saturday shortly after reading the
morning newspapers and what he wrote acquired a particular relevance for
me because of a news report in that morning's Daily Mail.
The item concerned the Tory leadership contest. It reported how John
Redwood's campaign had allegedly received a considerable boost because
of the declared support of Lord Tebbit (who does not have a vote and
whose political position was, in any case, already obvious) and a
statement by Virginia Bottomley. The Secretary of State for Health had
apparently indicated in a TV interview that if John Redwood were elected
leader she would be prepared, if asked, to serve in his Government.
The correct reaction to that is: so what? Of course Mrs Bottomley,
like most other members of the Cabinet, would probably be prepared to
stay on under Mr Redwood. Some might not be able to stick the idea; some
might not be asked. As it happens, Mrs Bottomley is exactly the sort of
person Mr Redwood probably would NOT ask.
I saw the interview in question which was shown yesterday and what Mrs
Bottomley said, when asked if she would serve, was: ''I don't think
anyone seriously thinks that will be a prospect we will be facing.'' She
was also rather rude about Mr Redwood.
Nevertheless this interview had been turned into an item of ''news'',
as a huge blow for John Major, as an embarrassment to him and his
campaign, when in fact it was actually political propaganda by a
newspaper actively campaigning against him. Making news? Or faking news?
Its relevance for me was that I had spent much of the previous day
following Mrs Bottomley around her constituency, listening to her
addressing her local voters, answering questions from schoolchildren and
talking to individuals. According to my notebook she made at least seven
enthusiastic public references to John Major in which she spoke of him
as a ''nice person'', a ''good man'', and an excellent Prime Minister.
She liked working for him, thought he would win the election easily, and
was distinctly negative about any other outcome.
In her best Mary Poppins manner she told a schoolchild playing the
part of John Redwood in a mock election: ''If you don't win I hope
you're going to be a very good team player.''
The purpose of the Daily Mail story was pure mischief, and everyone
involved in its publication knew as much. It was not in itself damaging,
but then neither was it ''news'' and nor should it have been presented
as such.
Whose fault was this -- the ambitious young journalist who reported
the interview or the editorial staff who prepared it for publication? I
certainly remember the ignominy of my own youthful discovery that I was
not heading for a career as a fearless Fleet Street gossip columnist. I
had been sent to find out whether the late Bill Simpson, then enjoying
huge fame as the first Dr Finlay, was about to marry a particular
actress. I bought him lunch in a pub on some flimsy pretext and then,
hugely embarrassed, revealed the real reason -- which he had, of course,
already guessed. I had to ask him these questions, I explained, and he
took pity on me and kindly heard me out. To every question he replied:
''I don't know.''
When I returned to the office, claiming in relief that there was no
story, they asked me what precisely he had said. Had I asked all the
questions? Was he going to marry the lady? My relief was short-lived.
The story appeared as a page lead: ''TV's Dr Finlay is uncertain about
his future with Miss X. Is he going to marry her? ''I don't know'' he
told the Daily Beast . . .'' Making news? Or faking it?
Creative journalism as practised by Cudlipp was altogether a more
subtle and sophisticated matter. And was it wrong? As he argues himself
he gave them all manner of amusement, from church services for people's
pets and the artists of the Tower circus to Uproar Over Unfrocked
Rector's Public Shame and the mysterious Case of the Missing Blackpool
Fullback. But, he boasts, and with some justification, his exclusives
were not inaccurate, misleading or distorted; distinguished between
comment and fact; were not intrusive or intimidating; and did not
require misrepresentation or subterfuge. He made news in the public
interest for the public interest. Alas that we shall not see those days
again.

THE LOST VICTORY: BRITISH
DREAMS, BRITISH REALITIES
1945-1950.
By Correlli Barnett.
Macmillan #20 (pp 514)
UNDERSTANDABLY, in 1945, Britons believed they had won the war against
Germany and Japan. Their most successful general, Montgomery, had taken
the surrender of the German armies in the west, and their
representatives had been present aboard USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay when
the Americans accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces.
The Empire had been fully restored and, contrary to what is normally
noted in books, its fullest extent had not after all been fixed in 1918,
for Cyrenaica was informally added in 1945, an expansion devoutly wished
by the new Foreign Secretary, Labour's Ernest Bevin.
Moreover the Axis surrenders (and these included Italy earlier) were
unconditional, advertising in that fact the overwhelming extent of
victory, a victory which, from the British point of view, also knocked
out the threat German and Japanese exports had posed to their
international trade before 1939.
The victory had been won by three main allies: Britain, the US, and
the Soviet Union -- the Great Powers, to whom weak China and defeated
France were added only by generosity. Of the Big Three only Britain had
entered the war on grounds of principle -- the Americans and Russians
had merely responded to Axis aggression against them -- and Britain had
for a time faced the Germans alone, in what proved to be glorious
isolation.
Correlli Barnett is right to start his analysis of the comprehensive
disaster the country suffered under the 1945-50 Labour Government by
establishing how this view of our wartime role distorted reality. We had
not won the war, but instead had been on the winning side.
It was American money and Russian manpower which defeated the Nazis.
Our own effort was magnificent, but marginal to the outcome. At the end
we were close to bankruptcy, but could not grasp its meaning or
consequence because of the heady brew of succcess.
The Labour Government which was unexpectedly elected in 1945 had to
deal with this complex situation in which public opinion was
ill-equipped to recognise reality. It was ill-equipped to do so itself
and signally failed to establish the right priorities -- investment
before consumption -- which were unerringly accepted on the Continent,
since no-one there had any doubts about what the war had done to their
economies.
Barnett has a polemical tone -- this is not dry as dust history -- but
that does not affect the quality of the argument which begins by
noticing how the new Government adopted a stance in international
affairs commensurate only with being a Great Power, and not the much
more modest power which the country had become.
Hence the leaders of the armed forces (who might be forgiven, since
they had participated in the, eventually, successful fighting) shared
the grandiose notions of their political masters. Attlee, identified
here as a foreign policy realist, was somewhat more cautious (though,
without telling the Cabinet, he committed the country to the huge
expense of atomic weaponry) but his colleagues, notably Bevin, were for
maintaining the myth of Great Power status at enormous cost.
Defence spending under Labour took an enormous slice of the national
income, around one-quarter of the state budget, in spite of the
knock-out of the Axis and before the emergence of the Cold War.
The assumptions behind this policy, particularly the weight accorded
to the Empire, were themselves suspect -- here Barnett is maintaining
his argument from earlier books about the Empire being a burden rather
that a source of strength, an argument now widely accepted.
If the country could not afford this international role, could it
afford the vastly expensive welfare state and National Health Service,
designed with a prodigality far beyond that of Sir William Beveridge, on
whose thinking they were based? The financing of state insurance
benefits, already detached from contributions, was now massively
increased, and warnings of eventual catastrophe (now looming,
incidentally) were ignored. The health service did not even have a
contributions myth: its cost quickly escalated wildly out of control,
presenting the Government with continual stress, but no other country in
the world with a model.
No Government has successfully managed to reform the service because
of the political cost of assaulting its main assumption, that it is free
at the point of use. Even the one available wedge, prescription charges,
eventually conceded by its main creator, Aneurin Bevan, still leaves
more than two-thirds of prescriptions free.
The enormous sums involved in this, and the housing policy designed to
give every family a house of its own, were a colossal strain on
available resources. They were paid for by American loans and by not
investing in productive industry or the infrastructure.
The Government had no plan (nothing remotely analagous to the French
national plan) and no coherent policy for the economy. It had
nationalisation but that did not revolutionise anything and merely
distorted the allocation of scarce resources. It certainly did not
address technical, and technological, weakness from education to
management, identified here in page after page.
Nor could it when the Government itself, and its advisers, were so
conspicuously lacking in technical and managerial expertise. Of
Ministers, only Cripps had managerial experience to an extent sufficient
for Barnett to call him ''a technocrat''. The top civil servants were
nearly all Oxbridge classicists with no involvement in industry. Yet it
was mainly industry -- and its exports -- which were vital to the
economy's salvation.
Barnett runs through a range of industries and activities: textiles,
shipbuilding, the mines, the railways, aeronautics, gas (where he adds
notes of direct personal experience). Their experience had few positive
gains: state intervention proved to be more harmful than helpful.
Of course the Government had bad luck. Nationalisation changed little
if anything in workers' attitudes (voluntary absenteeism and strike
statistics make that clear) and the fearful winter of 1947, with the
coldest February in 300 years, was a disaster of its own, especially on
the railways (effectively denied investment by the Government which
funnelled it into housing).
The fact was that the economy did not grow very much, the foreign
loans (Canadian as well as American) were consumed and the investment in
new plant, new products, and the infrastructure to serve them, so
conspicuous in defeated France and Germany, was inadequate.
Those who presided over this failure were neither wicked nor stupid.
They believed in goodness and social improvement and they were thrown by
victory and the need to offer better lives to their fellow citizens.
Fifty years later it is clear that good intentions are not enough,
that profit is not a dirty word but a necessity, and that international
roles are only to be played where we have a direct material interest --
such as we did in Kuwait and assuredly do not have in Bosnia.

IN your report, Region's role in gas row attacked (June 24),
Councillor Gould illustrates how unfit he and the entire Labour
administration are to protect the interests of the electorate, or to
understand financial matters.
No-one has suggested that Strathclyde Regional Council's pension fund
should not be invested in British Gas. What was suggested was that at
the AGM the voting power of the shares held by the pension fund should
have been used to express a vote of no confidence in the gas board
directors following their awarding a 75% salary increase to Cedric
Brown, chief executive.
All local authority pension funds should use their voting power to
ensure that the companies' profits go to the benefit of the pensioners
and not to awarding chief executives or directors undue salary increases
or share options.
Grampian region and Central have given a clear lead. Strathclyde and
the new unitary authorities must quickly follow their example.
A united lead on behalf of local government pensioners may encourage
the private sector pension fund holders also to ensure that their voting
power is used to represent the interests of pensioners whose funds they
hold.

I WAS intrigued by the notion in your front-page headline on June 27
that the Conservative leadership contest was a ''battle for soul of Tory
party''.
I had thought that the purpose of politicians (if they have any) was
to try to knock the sharp edges off amoral market forces. Both Mr Major
and Mr Redwood seem to be of the view that market forces should shape
our moral values.
In the context that Mrs Thatcher held similar views and has already
dispensed with any soul the Tory party had, the current contestants
would seem to be too late to engage in the battle you suggest.
It is an unfortunate sign of the times that any political party
wishing to pursue the current Conservative agenda (even if it be New
Labour) has no need of, or apparently use for, a soul.

TWO factors in the leadership campaign emerged yesterday that should
have a considerable impact on tomorrow night's result. The first is what
Major and Redwood said, bearing in mind that the electorate in this kind
of vote may be duplicitous, but the candidates themselves rarely tell
outright lies in public.
Mr Major declared that he does not feel betrayed by Redwood's
challenge to him and that there will be no recriminations. Mr Redwood
stated that he wants the leadership resolved tomorrow and that whoever
wins should receive 100% support.
This contradicts the perception of some that what he really wants is
to damage Major sufficiently to cause a second ballot in which Michael
Portillo could take up his standard. This would create the risk of a
successful intervention by Michael Heseltine.
The second factor is that the Tory constituency parties are
overwhelmingly in favour of Major and threaten dark deeds if their
advice is ignored by their MPs. They find that they have already been
deserted by erstwhile Tory voters; now it might be their turn to desert
Tory MPs seeking to hold their seats in a General Election.
Let us take the second factor first. Anybody who has kept in touch
with the voluntary wing of the Tory party -- those who do the
door-knocking and raise the money -- over the past three years in
particular will have picked up the message. It is this: if the
parliamentary party cannot unite behind its leader, come what may, why
should we bother any more?
Weekend opinion polls, external and internal -- confirm this view. If
another Tory leader is dumped, these people will react furiously. It is
not just a matter of de-selecting sitting MPs as candidates for a
General Election. This is hard to do precisely and fairly when their MPs
vote tomorrow in a secret ballot.
It is more serious than this. The threat is that next time it will not
just be Tory voters who stay at home to accord Labour a victory, but
Tory activists who will do so -- to accord Labour a landslide victory.
Belatedly, the parliamentary party is moving towards the idea that it is
daft to have rules that allow an annual challenge to the leadership of a
sitting Prime Minister.
The party in the country has been telling the parliamentary party this
since Sir Anthony Meyer challenged Prime Minister Thatcher and opened up
the grudgers' delight of the ''stalking horse'' concept. In Opposition,
a party can take these kind of factional risks. In Government, that
party looks and smells suicidal.
Over the past week, full-time party political agents of long standing
in their jobs, plus a series of constituency chairmen, have told me that
they will quit if Mr Major is humiliated. ''If this happens, I go,'' is
what they say. ''If this happens, Blair would be crazy not to engineer a
General Election in the next nine months. That means obliteration for
us.''
So, emerging over the weekend is this new element, always there but
not so baldly stated: whoever Major's successor might be, he would have
no time to restore morale and loyalty in the constituencies. Discount
for hyperbole, and you still have a disaster potential for the Tories.
Unless, that is, you think Mr Redwood would give voters such a charge as
Prime Minister that the party activists would rejoin the Tory cause too.
Of course, this is what Redwood is offering in resigning from Major's
Government and standing against him. He claims that if the leader can't
make his own views clear, and state them sharply, he has no chance of
coping with Blair and his new model Labour alternative. He is developing
his campaign in its closing stages from the ideological to the starkly
practical. Vote Redwood for the best chance of holding your seats. No
change, no chance.
Both candidates were interviewed by Sir David Frost on BBC breakfast
television yesterday and it was from these interviews that Factor One
emerged. They have a common interest in not wanting a second ballot. Mr
Redwood went first and made his pitch as the best leader to win a
General Election. The formula is tax and spending cuts now, plus a
''never'' to a single European currency and a referendum on this issue
when it has to be faced.
He is playing on the gutsy factor -- ie, he and he alone has had the
courage actually to put up against Major whereas others, like Portillo
and Heseltine, are still lurking around awaiting the providence of a
second ballot. No wonder he wants it sorted tomorrow. Why should he owe
them anything, should he win? And why should he support them,
particularly Portillo, if he loses? To get a better Cabinet job than
Wales?
Mr Major followed him into the Frost studio, having heard what he said
about the need for 100% support for the winner tomorrow night. Major
said his opponent had behaved ''perfectly honourably'' in standing
against him. ''I am not in the business of recriminations. I am not a
factional politician. I don't feel betrayed by John Redwood. You don't
call a leadership election and then complain if somebody takes you up on
it.''
This sounds like mending fences. A Major victory will not mean a purge
of the right wing from his Government's 110 posts. It could also mean a
return to Cabinet for Redwood, providing he concedes defeat gallantly,
discounting abstentions and offering 100% support for the winner. What
chance then of his right-wing rival, Portillo, benefiting from a second
ballot at his, Redwood's, expense?
If this sounds fanciful, look at it this way. Such conduct would earn
the 44-year-old Redwood good opinions throughout the party, not least
from the activists. His integrity as a young, able, and honourably
ambitious politician would be re-established.
If Major reneged on his pledge of no recriminations his chance of
creating unity -- the whole purpose of the exercise -- would be gone.
Redwood lives to fight another day, still able to influence Cabinet
decisions. He loses the ''extreme'' right label and, centre stage, joins
the much broader power base of the centre right.
There is, of course, another side to the coin. Sufficient MPs may
seize this chance, the last before a General Election, for a more macho
alternative leader. A Redwood victory would bring about the instant
resignation of the Prime Minister, a concept deeply desired by sections
of the erstwhile Tory media and the Tory back benches. But Redwood would
be hard-put to establish unity.
It is commonly thought Mr Blair would rather have Major maintained in
office, preferably as a lame-duck leader. But a Redwood victory would
suit him by pushing the Tories further to the right, leaving him in
command of the centre ground that wins elections. So much so that he
could spring a confidence motion and bring forward the date of the
General Election.
Only suicidal Tories could countenance such a possibility. They need
all the time they have left to try to regain the country's confidence.
In short, when they vote tomorrow they might remember Margaret
Thatcher's Tina, (There Is No Alternative), as propounded now by her
successor.

WITH a Conservative Party leadership contest sprung upon us again for
the second time in five years questions must be asked about the
credibility of the British political system as a bona fide democracy.
In April 1992 41.8% of the British electorate voted for the
Conservative Party led by John Major, yet in the weeks to come we may
well see the democratically expressed wish of this 41.8% overturned by
the very Conservative MPs who got elected on a platform of John Major's
leadership.
In the months running up to the 1992 General Election John Major, like
other political party leaders, was placed at the forefront of the
Conservative Party's campaign to gain re-election and thus when those
41.8% of the electorate put their cross in the Conservative box they
also explicity endorsed John Major as the Prime Minister for five years
in an indirect way by voting for Conservative candidates.
The Conservative Party's practice of changing leader when in
government is dubious in a democracy because the 329 Conservative MPs
who will decide John Major's fate this month have a democratic
legitimacy that is derived only from the particular constituency in
which they were elected as an MP, whereas John Major is the only
politician elected on a nationwide basis with his mandate derived from
the British electorate. Thus in a democracy the Prime Minister should
only be removable by that electorate at a General Election.
The Conservative Party should urgently consider scrapping this
leadership contest from the party constitution during the period that
the party is in government. Should the Conservatives continue with this
practice Britain may be lumbered with a one-party state for ever.
The danger is that if a Conservative Government is suffering extreme
unpopularity as in 1990 and 1995 it can dump the old Prime Minister,
wheel in a new Prime Ministger, and thereby change the whole personality
of the Government, giving the electorate the impression that the party
is revitalised with new policies when in fact it's the same collection
of Conservative MPs with the same old ideas.

CAN anyone tell me why everyone seems to assume that Socialism has
failed? Where did we ever have Socialism?
Certainly not in Soviet Russia as James Burnham showed many years ago
in his book The Managerial Revolution.
We have had the Labour Party in power in this country but they were
working with a capitalist system. Has there ever been Socialism in any
country?
Those who believe that private enterprise is superior to public
enterprise are appealing to human greed to produce more and more goods
in the belief that human happiness depends on havingness.
If more goods are what is wanted, why can't Socialism produce the
goods? Is it because it isn't based on greed? Is it desirable that we
must be greedy to get what we want?
Values are all important. Is the desire to have more a good human
value?

success of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and a Comprehensive Test

ecological balance of the planet, damage which simply cannot be
calculated; and shocking to those who live in the South Pacific and to

MAY I offer a few observations on the article by Mary Docherty on
local authority policies on placing requests (Education Herald, June
20)?
The placing request legislation was never thought through properly
before being implemented. Either that, or the implications were ignored.
As well as the problem experienced by Mary Docherty (of one child
failing to obtain a place in the same school as his brothers), it has
led inevitably to class sizes rising to the maximum of 33 pupils, in
both primary and secondary sectors, and to the situation where children
who have moved into the catchment area of a school have to be
transported by taxi to a school miles away until a place in their local
school becomes available.
While sympathising with Mary Docherty in her particular situation, I
find it hard to accept that she never foresaw the possibility of their
third son being refused a place in Notre Dame Primary School.
In a popular school there must always be the chance that this will
happen. Projected school rolls are available for several years ahead,
and they must have indicated a rising intake from the catchment area.
It was explained to Mary Docherty that the school had room for only
one primary one class, but this was disputed later at the appeal
hearing. Every school has an agreed capacity, designed to allow it to
operate efficiently and without overcrowding.
There may well be a spare room somewhere where an extra class could be
accommodated, but would this reduce the space available for other
essential school activities, such as music and drama?
As for the argument that the region should employ an extra teacher at
Notre Dame, current financial restrictions simply do not make this a
practical solution, bearing in mind that the same situation is repeated,
year in, year out, in many of Strathclyde's schools.
The main point in Mary Docherty's article seems to be the proposition
that in the case of too few places being available in a school priority
should be given to those children with siblings already at the school,
whether or not they live in the catchment area.
I find this amazingly self-centred. If all the 15 children from
outwith the catchment area of Notre Dame, but with brothers and sisters
already in the school, were to be allocated places this year, what does
Mary Docherty suggest should happen to the 15 children from within the
catchment area who would then be displaced?
To which school should they be transported, and how many miles away
from their homes would it be? Who would be responsible for ensuring, and
paying for, their safe transport there?
Most important of all, should every parent in the catchment area of a
school really be expected to live with the uncertainty until the very
last moment of wondering if their child will be allocated a place in the
local school?
I agree that the placing request legislation needs to be reviewed, but
the answer does not lie in scrapping the catchment area system. Without
it, administration of the education system would be impossible and chaos
would result.

I WAS rather aggrieved to hear that Michael Portillo has had no fewer
than 20 new telephone lines installed. It is presumed that this has been
done to assist hs challenge in the Tory leadership contest should there
be a second ballot. The decision to install them must, therefore, have
been made in the last very few days.
For more than a week now I have awaited the installation of a single
phone line to my factory unit. Today I was told that though it had been
scheduled for today I would have to wait.
In an effort to speed up my telephone installation, I should like to
make the following categorical statement:
''The rumours indicating that I might stand for election as leader of
the Conservative Party are unfounded. I have no plans to put my name
forward in the first ballot for Conservative Party leader. I assure you
that the Prime Minister will win in the first ballot and win
convincingly. There will be no second ballot and Mr Major continues to
enjoy my full support.''
After that denial, I assume British Telecom will be breaking down my
door to install my telephone line.

THE selection procedure for candidates for the ministry seems to me in
need of an overhaul. My main concern is for the candidates who feel
genuinely called to the ministry. In their years of study at divinity
college they can face a selection committee three times in all, if they
do not succeed first time round.
Failure to succeed at any of these interviews does not entitle the
applicants to the benefit of any constructive criticism. In fact they
are never told where they went wrong at all.
All the while, the earnest, diligent candidates are studying and
preaching -- it could be almost every week. In this way they are gaining
experience and the more mature candidates, with more experience of life
and the world in general, are very much in touch with grassroot Church
members.
If however the candidate fails the third interview then his hopes can
be dashed forever unless an appeal is made against the decision and he
appears before a further committee of 20 members.
Whether or not they are all qualified clergymen no-one knows because
they appear in mufti, but they have all reached the giddy heights of 121
George Street, the Church of Scotland's equivalent of the Houses of
Parliament, so are deemed capable of deciding who best to let loose on
unsuspecting congregations.
There is still no hint of criteria to be met, no encouragement, no
empathy. The inrerviewee is dealt with coldly and almost as a prisoner
in the dock who has to prove his worth to his inquisitors.
To have reached this rather demeaning stage in the process of
selection and still be able to be polite and rational deserves a medal
for tenacity, strong character, strong will, and strong stomach. Would
someone without the proper motivation have travelled so far along the
road to achieving his goal -- being called to the ministry of the Church
of Scotland?
If new blood in the form of genuinely dedicated candidates is
discouraged without explanation by unsympathetic, unfriendly,
uncommunicative selection panels, then the Church has no future, only a
self-perpetuating desire to live in the past and a seeming death wish to
hold itself aloof from the real world.

ALL strength to the students of Gray's School of Art whom Clare Henry
extols (June 19). But shame on her for having believed the propaganda
that conceals the dirty deal between city councillors and Aberdeen's
newest university.
Robert Gordon University has offered to sell the old Gray's School of
Art at the city centre. In exchange the city might persuade the
Secretary of State to sacrifice green belt parkland, including part of a
designated conservation area on the River Dee.
Within yards, on a legitimate industrial site, Sainsbury's is hoping
to build beside a development proclaimed as Britain's biggest
home-improvement store -- all this on the road that funnels all traffic
from the north and west of the city into the notorious Bridge of Dee
roundabout.
But the regional roads department may not object. After all, their
next employers may be city councillors.
A ''university campus'' at Garthdee would only bring an additional
population the size of Stonehaven's. Much more important to get the
traffic off Union Street. And how nice to have a new Heritage Centre in
the old building beside the Art Gallery -- very cheap at the price of a
little congestion at the edge of town.
The former allotment holders have been quietly evicted and a block
vote by the economic development committee has pre-determined how the
planning committee should vote after the pretence of a public hearing.
The cut-price purchase of our green belt will bring Robert Gordon
University no popularity in a local community whose formerly quiet
streets have already become overspill car-parks and traffic ''rat
runs''.

peaceful purposes. President Rafsanjani, the Iranian leader, said so at
the weekend, indicating that American diplomatic pressure on the
Russians spearheaded by Vice President Gore has been unavailing. The
Russians desperately need the hard currency the Iranians can provide
from their oil earnings and there is little doubt that what they will
offer will have peaceful uses. The rub is that the process involved is
bound to provide access to weapons-grade plutonium eventually, so that
even if the Iranians have only the most pacific intentions at the
moment, they are bound to be tempted to take the steps towards a nuclear
weapon capacity. Few observers would doubt that their intention is to
enjoy that opportunity.
The Americans have two motivations. In general they want to prevent
the proliferation of nuclear capacities. The case for their concern is
obvious, and will be widely shared. In particular, the Middle East is
already an unstable region, with the bitterness between Israel and some
of its neighbours, especially the most militant Islamic states,
remaining marked in spite of progress with the Palestinians. The
creation of Arab nuclear powers is bound to worry the Israelis acutely
enough for them to consider pre-emptive action, a move whose
consequences are not altogether clear. President Rafsanjani affects to
believe that any such course is unlikely since attacks might easily
involve casualties among Russian personnel who would be involved in
constructing any nuclear plant (Iran does not have the specialised
workers and scientists required).
The Israelis may not be deterred by that possibility. The chance of an
adverse Russian reaction to any pre-emptive strike will be less
important in their calculations than the chance of the Iranians
providing plutonium to other Israeli enemies, or of their using it for
nuclear warheads for delivery systems of their own purchased from the
Chinese. The Americans should redouble their efforts with the Russians
to keep tinder away from a region with so many matches waiting to be
struck.

DR Elizabeth Wilson (Profits rather than well-being, June 21) forgets
that it was private enterprise which created the rail network she is
arguing it will now destroy.
Nor is it true that, presumably, rapacious private landlords, cleared
the Highlands for sheep. H H Lamb in Climate, History and the Modern
World, says: ''The physical background to . . . the history of Scotland
shows itself in the fact that the upper limit of cultivation on the
Lammermuir Hills south-east of Edinburgh, which had been as high as 425m
(nearly 1400 feet) above sea-level at one point in the mid-thirteenth
century, fell in stages until in 1600 it was 200m lower.''

IN the debate about what happens to John Major, one of the
implications of his decision to call the contest has been neglected.
Douglas Hurd's departure from the Foreign Office was not prompted by the
Prime Minister's decision to call a leadership election, although it
affected the announcement's timing. But who inherits the Foreign Office
does depend on what happens to Mr Major. No unseasonable leadership
election would have meant that the Defence Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind,
could have inherited a job he dearly wants. Should Mr Major win hands
down, the reshuffle patronage is his to dispense without preconditions;
Mr Rifkind could still be a happy man. If Major is badly damaged, the
Foreign Office will probably have to go to somebody from the
Euro-sceptic right -- possibly the Home Secretary, Michael Howard, as
the price of survival. And if Mr Major is destroyed, we move on to round
two, and it is anybody's guess.
In a Heseltine Cabinet it ought to go to a good European, but Mr
Heseltine's victory could depend on deals struck with the Euro-sceptic
right, which is why Mr Portillo gets mentioned. The Foreign Office is
going to be increasingly important in the run-up to the 1996
intergovernmental conference, even if the timetable on economic and
monetary union continues to slip. The issue of Britain's role in Europe
will dominate political debate for the rest of the decade. While some
Prime Ministers try to do the Foreign Secretary's job themselves -- Mrs
Thatcher was always interfering -- Michael Heseltine, given his state of
health, needs a man he can trust to do things his way unwatched, not a
hostage to fortune. In a Portillo or Redwood Cabinet it would go to a
Euro-sceptic and it would be a case of fasten your seatbelts. Handbag
days are here again.
But Europe, and Yugoslavia, are not the only issues. There is a
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in the autumn where egos must
be massaged. Who follows Hurd matters. Malcolm Rifkind should be the
man, with Ian Lang as the preferred option, because the other
possibilities inspire little confidence.

AMONG the white writers and artists who struggled valiantly against
apartheid in South Africa was the theatre director Barney Simon. Simon's
death last week will be mourned far beyond theatrical circles. He earned
a world-wide reputation as an opponent of racism through the policies
and practice of the Market Theatre of Johannesburg, which he co-founded
and co-directed. The Market Theatre steadfastly opposed apartheid,
insisting there should be no discrimination either on stage or in the
auditorium, and that the repertory should continue to raise political
issues however unpopular with the administration. Thanks to Simon and
his colleagues, black and white, the fame of his theatre spread beyond
South Africa and the company received many invitations to appear abroad
-- resulting, for example, in appearances in Edinburgh at festival time
and currently in a visit (with Antony Sher) to Britain. Simon had the
satisfaction of seeing his work vindicated with the establishment of
Nelson Mandela's non-racial Government.
Sceptics have suggested the Market Theatre could be tolerated by an
oppressive regime only because theatre is not a mass medium; plays don't
topple governments. The theatre's function might even be interpreted as
a safety valve, a dissident institution cynically allowed to give
harmless voice to disaffection which might otherwise have found release
in more threatening ways. But ideas are dangerous to a tyrannical
regime, and theatre at best is a platform for ideas. The repression
which the playwright (later President) Vaclav Havel suffered in
communist Czechoslovakia demonstrates this, and there are many other
instances.
It is distressing that even as the barriers to freedom of expression
fall in one part of the world, intolerance and repression show no sign
of easing elsewhere; indeed, from Africa and South America to the Far
East, the reverse may be true. The case of the writer Salman Rushdie is
the most glaring example -- recently back in the headlines when hopes of
a release from the Ayatollah's fatwa were cruelly dashed. Rushdie
survives. The Bangladeshi feminist writer Taslima Nasreen flees. Others
die in the cause of free speech. To be a writer of independent mind in
Algeria is carte blanche for murder. Barney Simon's legacy is a noble
one, but far from comforting.

AS YOU roll along on the conveyor-belt of a career, one of the
bewildering facts of life is that you run out of colleagues who have
shared your experience. I find myself raising the names of newspaper
characters from the past -- and encountering blank expressions from
those who have never heard of them.
''It was before my time,'' they say. So with a sigh of resignation I
must now accept that those who were around me in the 1940s are either in
retirement or have advanced to that higher point of Elysian contentment.
It was therefore all the more of a pleasure at the weekend to meet up
with one of the finest journalists of his day -- not a name widely known
to the public but a guiding hand who shaped up great newspapers and
became editor of two.
Jack Campbell takes his place in the history of Scottish journalism
for several reasons. As a youngster at Copland Road School, Glasgow,
just after the First World War, he found himself without a father -- and
with a mother left to bring up six children.
As so often in those days, there was nothing for it but to get out and
work. In 1928, at the age of 15, he turned up at this same Albion Street
building where I sit now, to become the very first copyboy and start a
newspaper adventure.
The Scots-bred Lord Beaverbrook had turned a tobacco factory into a
modern centre of journalism, home of his new Scottish Daily Express --
and to my knowledge Jack Campbell is the last survivor of that original
staff.
Within a year, the quiet, bright lad had become the paper's first cub
reporter. By 21 he was night news editor of the Express, a progress
interrupted only by the war, in which he was to be found in command of a
deep-sea rescue tug in the Atlantic.
His post-war story was a predictable one which took him to the
editorship of those other Beaverbrook enterprises, the Evening Citizen
and the Scottish Sunday Express.
And when he retired in 1978, he took a freelancing role in which he
edited the company newspaper of the great Christian Salvesen
organisation, founded by that Norwegian gent who came to Scotland and
established himself in whaling and with a fleet of merchant ships.
In that role, Jack Campbell came across a mystery which he set out to
solve -- and it was in that connection we met up the other day.
Among the models and pictures of ships, he found a Salvesen trawler
called Fairtry, which intrigued him. Although of post-war origin, it had
already slipped into oblivion. Yet, if it was as significant as Jack
Campbell believed, there was a story here to be dug up and recorded. His
newspaper instincts blazed into action.
The story was, indeed, a fascinating one. It began with a quite
remarkable inventor, Sir Dennis Burney, who had worked with ICI at
Ardeer during the war, developing secret weapons.
Before that, however, he was the man who had gone into partnership
with Vickers to build the famous R100 airship (the one which didn't
crash!). He then produced a streamlined car, which he also named the
R100 -- with its engine at the back. Was the man mad?
The Germans didn't think so, and it was left to them to mass produce a
smaller version under the name of the Volkswagen Beetle.
Such is the fate of inventors. Although his father had been Jellicoe's
second-in-command at the battle of Jutland, Burney had no connection
with fishing, except that his observation told him the industry was not
as efficient as it should be.
He thought he could change the face of it. And his proposal was to
send out a purpose-built trawler, fishing from the stern, which would
travel to grounds, catch, fillet, pack and freeze the fish and bring it
home to sell in the big stores.
There was little support for the idea. But Captain Harold Salvesen,
like Burney unconnected with the fishing industry, decided to gamble
that the inventor was right.
He backed the idea, had this stern-trawling factory ship built at
Lewis's yard in Aberdeen in 1953, and chose the name Fairtry, which had
a hint of daring adventure about it.
If there was resistance at home, the Russians were soon spying on
Fairtry -- and copying it. For good or ill, this forgotten ship had
certainly changed the shape of the industry. Among the side issues of a
remarkable tale, we learned how it came to introduce the name of
fish-fingers into our vocabulary, sparking off the massive frozen-food
industry we know today.
Jack Campbell had rescued a piece of modern industrial history which,
like so much of our heritage, was being allowed to slip down the drain
to oblivion. The man who started as a newspaper copyboy 67 years ago had
never written a book. But he couldn't avoid this one.
At 82, that's what he has done -- and appropriately, it was down by
the port of Leith, scene of the Salvesen origins, that The Fairtry
Experiment was launched. It bears all the immaculate research of a fine
journalist, complete with grammar and punctuation of the model variety.

Meanwhile, Cardinal Basil Hume yesterday reassured Catholics that
priests would retain their vows of celibacy.
The pledge, by the leader of Catholics in England and Wales, follows
Vatican approval for the ordination of former Anglican clergy.
In a letter read at masses, Cardinal Hume acknowledged the presence of
married priests in parishes raised a number of ''important and
sensitive'' issues. But he stressed it was not a step toward allowing
all priests to wed.
''The permission being given for the ordination of these married men
are by way of exception,'' he said. ''They will be given personally by
the Holy Father. These permissions do not change the general rule of the
Catholic Church, that priests must be celibate.''
The Catholic Church has been forced to consider the matter in the
light of the number of Anglican priests leaving the Church of England
over the ordination of women.
Cardinal Hume said priesthood would not be ''demeaned'' by the fact
that a priest could also be a husband and father.

David Butler records how a shock defeat by Attlee at the polls 50
years ago robbed Winston Churchill of a peace-time victory that had
seemed assured
FIFTY years ago this week -- on July 5, 1945 -- Britain went to the
polls for the first General Election in 10 years.
It was high summer; the European war was at last over. Winston
Churchill, the victorious Prime Minister, has failed to persuade Labour
to continue the wartime coalition but his new ''caretaker'' government
was sailing to victory -- or so everyone thought.
The campaign had been vigorous, a reaction to the silent years of the
wartime party truce. Churchill drew vast crowds to his rallies but the
cheers were for the leader in war rather than for the leader of the
Conservative Party. Everywhere meetings were crowded and there was busy
canvassing.
In an old-fashioned pursuit of neutrality the BBC did not report the
election campaign in its news bulletins, but 10 half-hour broadcasts
were given to Conservative and 10 to Labour. Churchill gave four of
those for his party and one of them, in which he suggested that a Labour
victory would lead to a socialist Gestapo, was generally reckoned an own
goal.
The quiet Clement Attlee coolly dismissed the suggestion that he would
be at the mercy of the Labour Party executive and its over-assertive
chairman, Professor Laski. He focused on the theme that planning had won
the war and was needed to win the peace. The Conservatives displayed
posters of Churchill with the slogan ''Help him to finish the job''.
It was the first General Election to be held in June or July in this
century and it was unusual in other respects. In 19 seats, where a whole
town was away on a Wakes Week holiday, the vote was postponed for a
week. Nationwide the counting of ballots had to wait until July 26 for
postal ballots to come in from servicemen around the world.
On the day of the vote the News Chronicle published the first Gallup
poll election prediction ever made in Britain. No-one believed its
almost accurate finding of a Labour lead of 6%. A week later the Daily
Express had a headline: ''Experts tell Churchill 'You are in'.''
But on the morning of July 26, two hours into the count, the first BBC
flash reported that Labour had won 100 seats and the Conservatives 24.
By the end of the afternoon one of the greatest electoral landslides was
there for all to see. As a surprise outcome, its only rivals came much
later, in 1970 and in February 1974.
In 1935 the National Government won 432 seats and a clear majority of
249. Now Labour won 394 seats and a clear majority of 148 -- 226 seats
had changed hands. The 12% nationwide swing in votes was the largest
ever recorded in a British General Election. (It is noteworthy that
since 1945 the largest swing in a General Election has been 5%).
Five Ministers in the caretaker Cabinet lost their seats, including
the rising Harold Macmillan, the veteran Leo Army, and the Churchill
loyalist Brendan Bracken. Sir Archibald Sinclair was beaten in Caithness
in the narrowest of three-cornered races, and Dr McIntyre, the first
ever SNP member, lost Motherwell which he had just won in a by-election.
Notable among the 15 seats that changed hands in Scotland was Lanark
where Lord Dunglass (now Lord Home) was defeated. But Scotland swung
less than the rest of the country. In Glasgow the movement was merely a
2.5% swing with only one seat changing hands (Walter Elliott lost
Kelvingrove by 88 votes on a 0.2% swing). In Birmingham there was a 12%
swing and 9 seats out of 13 switched from Conservative to Labour.
Labour's English victory was in the most unlikely places -- prosperous
suburbs and traditional naval ports, as well as Eton, Cambridge, Harrow,
and Winchester.
And a new generation of politicians swept in -- Hugh Gaitskell, Harold
Wilson, Michael Foot, Barbara Castle and Hartley Shawcross. Others who
stood and lost were to come in five years later -- Roy Jenkins, Denis
Healey, Jo Grimond, Reggie Maudling and Iain Macleod (who vainly
contested his ancestral Western Isles).
On July 25 Roosevelt and Stalin agreed to suspend the Potsdam
conference for a day to allow the British politicians to go home for the
election results. It was a world-wide shock when Clement Attlee returned
alone to speak for Britain in place of Winston Churchill.
Labour has won only two General Elections with a working majority;
1945 was a much bigger victory than 1966 and the 1945-50 parliament left
a much bigger mark on British history than 1966-70.
Of course, if current opinion polls are to be believed, Labour now
stands ready to win an even greater victory. But 1997 is still a long
way off.

Britain's leading electoral historian.

William Russell considers whether in the age of satellite
communications and jet travel there is any need for Britain to maintain
a diplomatic corp around the world
WHAT do diplomats do? Hold birthday parties for the Queen, attend
cocktail parties, levees and balls, live in the lap of luxury in
splendid town houses in foreign capitals waited upon by liveried
servants, sip the odd Bucks fizz and nibble a canape while they compose
elegantly phrased telegrams containing the odd Latin or Greek phrase to
the Foreign Office about the local situation?
At times it looks like it, because there is no denying some of our
overseas embassies are housed in extremely grand buildings, occasional
posh parties are held in them, and there are ambassadors with toffee
noses, not to mention their wives. If the monarchy, Parliament, the
church -- those bastions of the Establishment -- come under fire today,
so too has that other pillar of the Old Boy network, the Diplomatic
Service. Does it deserve to?
Although to some extent the Foreign Office still is a home away from
home for the boys from the playing fields, the service is far more
democratic than the impression it gives.
Admittedly many diplomats do come from Oxford and Cambridge -- 73% of
last year's entrants did, which was in line with the number of Oxbridge
applicants -- but FO recruitment teams had targeted 23 universities from
Aberdeen to Brighton seeking recruits. The commitment was to choosing
the best.
But does the service have any place in a world rapidly turning into a
global village? Can much that it does not be done by fax? Do we need
reports from far-flung capitals when there are satellites, telephones
and computer links to make instant contact feasible?
One after-effect of the end of the cold war is that the secrecy which
was necessary for diplomatic dealings has been lessened. There can be
more openness. The problem is that people brought up to be discreet find
the change difficult. If one's career is founded on a nod, a wink and a
hint, rather than plain speaking it is difficult to speak plainly. It
has to be learnt.
Sir John Coles, Foreign Office permanent under-secretary, tried a
little plain speaking during a speech in Oxford when he tackled the
image problems facing the service. For a start, the cost of Britain's
entire diplomatic effort, including the World Service, the British
Council and peacekeeping, is #1300m, which is less than 60% of the
budget for West Midlands District Council. Or, to put it in another
context, roughly what we spend annually on buying jeans. It hardly adds
up to high spending worthy of a once great, imperial power, and if you
exclude all the extraneous things like our contributions to the UN,
Nato, the council of Europe, scholarships for overseas students and
military training, then the annual cost of the FO, at home and abroad,
is #650m.
What does that pay for? Some 215 diplomatic posts in 183 countries
staffed by 2530 diplomats from Britain and 7400 locally engaged staff.
As for those grand houses, there are only 25 which merit that
description and they are in capitals where, if one is to swim with the
big fish, one needs a decent pool. It is a tiny number out of some 3000
homes for foreign office staff around the world, and they are, Sir John
argued, ''a good tool to promote Britain''.
In fact, promoting Britain takes up a large part of a diplomat's time,
and while it is possible to argue that this could be done by civil
servants from the Department of Trade and Industry, they suffer from the
disadvantage of being home based. They would only be occasional
visitors. The diplomat is on the spot, and if trade and industry is his
special remit then he is in contact with the right people. Sir John
cited one of the grander expensive establishments, the Paris embassy --
cost #12.76m a year -- to demonstrate the job being done.
Paris arranges and staffs high-level visits to France -- more than 200
a year by politicians, businessmen, and others representing British
interests, Sir John said. Last year British exports to France, our third
biggest market, were worth #13.5bn. Commercial staff made more than 2000
visits to French companies and gave support to hundreds of British
companies at trade fairs, and the embassy helped Cable and Wireless
secure the licence for a new mobile phone network, and Forte fight off a
takeover battle for the Meridian Hotel chain. He believed that the
support offered to exporters could sometimes tip the balance between a
contract won or lost.
In addition, more than 10,000,000 Britons visit France each year, and
some 60,000 live there permanently. Their interests have to be looked
after. Last year some 14,500 Britons in distress were helped, and 11,000
passport problems solved. But those are the domestic things. France is
one of the major players in the Bosnian crisis, just as we are, and the
embassy is a vital channel of communication, and a look-out post. As
well as keeping in contact with French officials, it also watches how
French public opinion is reacting to events, something one cannot do
over the telephone, and not something one can learn from watching
satellite news.
There is much more -- from hostage situations, rebellions in which
Britons need to be evacuated, accidents, robberies, and assaults. The
consular service, one arm of the diplomatic set-up, is there to help.
As to whether there could be a world without diplomats, Sir John
believed he would not live to see it. It would have to be a world with
no conflicts to prevent, no political tensions to resolve, be free of
the menace of drugs, white-collar crime, money laundering and terrorism.
It would be a world in which British nationals never ended up in trouble
or in prison abroad, where British firms required no assistance to help
them export, and nobody needed overseas aid.
That world was not on offer.

The anti-roads protest movement has come a long way from the days of
isolated 'angry young men' chained to bulldozers to co-ordinated action
via the information superhighway. But where does it go from here? Anne
Johnstone investigates
IN a recent Gallup poll 62% of respondents said they supported
protesters who broke the law while disrupting motorway building. Last
month Emma Must of Alarm UK, an umbrella group of nearly 300 anti-road
campaign groups, won the prestigious #48,000 Goldman environmental
prize, which honours grassroots environmentalists.
Last week more than 40 local campaign groups, along with Alarm UK and
Friends of the Earth, joined together to protest against the creation
''by stealth'' of a Folkstone to Honiton south-coast highway, under the
guise of a mass of by-pass and road upgrading schemes.
What a long way it is from the naive bunch of tousled-haired
protesters who took on the Department of Transport over the M3 extension
outside Winchester, symbol of Government eco-insensitivity. That was
only three years ago. The media, and not just the tabloids, continue to
caricature the anti-roads movement in terms of dreadlocked youths
chaining themselves to bulldozers and swinging around the treetops.
''Nobody wanted to take a picture of me. I look too ordinary,'' says
Ian Cowan, without rancour. Cowan is a 33-year-old languages graduate
who works for Glasgow for People. Articulate, cheerful, quietly spoken,
he is the pressure group's only paid employee, earning #8000 a year.
Despite the failure of the battle to halt the M77, Cowan realises that
groups like his are gradually winning the war. ''It's obvious to anyone
that there are too many cars. I don't think our message is far away from
being universally accepted.''
Lesley Boulton has just turned 50 and belongs to a number of
environmental groups, including Earth First!, the direct action group
which has stolen much of the media show at Pollok Free State. She laughs
at the way the group has been characterised as wild and woolly ''angry
young men''.
Boulton describes her background as ''classically bourgeois''. She
went to boarding school and art school, and took a degree in archaeology
and classics. Tree houses? ''I wouldn't mind living in a tree house if I
could be linked up to the Internet, and so long as there was lots of hot
water!''
Like many of those in the counter-culture, she's enthusiatic about new
technology as an easy and convenient way of networking and can't imagine
life without her computer and fax machine.
Organisations like Road Alert have sprung up to service needs like
hers. Originating at Twyford Down, it has developed into a network of
road protesters who publish a fortnightly bulletin, providing up-to-date
information about all the latest anti-roads protests. It goes out by
mail, fax and e-mail to subscribers, many of whom process it on to
hundreds of others. A spokesman said it was impossible to estimate how
many people saw it.
Another sort of cross-fertilisation in the movement is typified by
Smallworld Video, based in Oxford. A non-profit-making organisation, it
teaches protesters to use camcorders, and distributes films of previous
roads protests. This enables small, local groups to learn from similar
campaigns elsewhere -- DIY activism.
John Stewart of Alarm UK, says: ''Local groups are beginning to come
together in a more structured way because they realise they can put more
strategic pressure on the authorities that way.'' The south coast
highway protest is just the latest example.
Stewart detects two distinct strands within the current roads
movement: ''First there are traditional residents' associations and
small-town groups. Their protest about a road scheme may start off as a
NIMBY movement (''Not In My Back Yard'') but as they become more
informed, and join in with other groups, they develop wider objectives.
''Then there are the young people who believe in direct action. They
are activists who have grown up under a pretty right-wing Government.
They feel excluded from mainstream politics. They are like two circles,
and occasionally they cross each other.
''Earth First! supporters are very different from those fighting the
Hastings by-pass. But because until recently the Government's roads
programme has been so horrendous, everyone has been moving in the same
direction. The reason why the Government has come under such pressure is
that they haven't been able to marginalise the Earth First! types.
Instead, these protesters have had a lot of tacit and some active
support.''
This remarkable alliance between the radicals and legions of county
ladies is typified by Lady Bullock, who when confronted with the
prospect of another road through Oxford, declared: ''If this goes ahead
I will sit down in front of the bulldozer.''
Although road schemes are still going ahead, few doubt that the
protesters are winning the public relations war hands down. The notion
that more roads generate more traffic, once dismissed as radical
nonsense, is now almost universally accepted, and formed one of the key
conclusions of the Royal Commission's report on pollution. Faced with
massive opposition, not from shaggy youths denied their social security
benefits, but voters, many of them former Tory voters, the Government is
rapidly scaling down its roads programme. So where does the roads
movement go from here?
For a long time respected lobby groups such as Transport 2000 have
concentrated on suggesting positive alternatives to current policy.
Smaller local groups like Glasgow for People are now trying to go the
same way. Their Alternative Strategy to the Ayr Road Route was part
funded by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and Friends of the Earth. They
will continue to run campaigns. Next will be the M74 extension and after
that probably the M80 link through Strathkelvin. But with local and
national government quickly donning green clothes in their transport
policies, local protest groups have to adopt new roles and stategies.
''We'll keep highlighting their record and look at whether they are
putting their money where their mouths are,'' says Ian Cowan.

WITH the summer here, Scotland's towns are once more alive with
soldiers, wastrels and strumpets -- and with ghosts, hangmen and the odd
Mary, Queen of Scots. It is street theatre time, as the country's past
is acted out in a welter of Heritage Events, Living History and Ghost
Walks.
Street theatre has grown in popularity over a decade. Unlike
traditional theatre, the streets do not offer the security of reliable
lighting, controlled temperature and a distant audience. Street theatre
is raw and immediate -- and potentially unforgiving if things go wrong.
Nowhere is this more true than with the costumes.
A new breed of costumier has emerged to provide for open-air drama.
One of these is Sandra Morton, based in Stirling. A freelance, she
contracts to the Stirling Heritage Events Company, whose performances
range from Fort George to Ayr. ''It's not like ordinary theatre,'' she
says.
''Our actors are in among the audience. Costumes have to look
authentic close up. People notice things. Take machine stitching; it
simply looks wrong, so I try to hide it with braid where possible. Hand
stitching looks best but it's too slow. Whatever happens, seams need to
be strong. You can't have clothes held together with safety pins as you
can on stage.''
Weather, of course, is a big problem. Costumes must be neither too hot
nor too cold. Above all, they have to be able to survive a soaking.
Certain fabrics are definitely out. Velvet blotches horribly in rain,
and wool poses obvious difficulties. Once, Morton made Redcoat uniforms
out of woollen cloth, lining them with calico for stiffness in the
authentic manner. ''They looked wonderful,'' she smiles wryly, ''until
the sun shone and the actors just melted. You learn the hard way
sometimes.''
Finding the right cloth is crucial. For a start, it has to be tough.
Early on, the Events Company employed ordinary theatrical costumiers and
David Kinnaird, their events manager, recalls getting some men's coats
made of pressed felt. ''After one wearing they were like pobbly old
jumpers. That's why we turned to Sandra, who really understands the
properties of materials.''
Again, fabrics must look genuine without being too expensive. For
brocade waistcoats, for example, Morton uses upholstery material.
Needlecord makes a tolerable velvet substitute, and as it moves well,
actors like it. The most exotic fabrics, not surprisingly, cause the
most trouble.
Just now she is costuming for the Dundee Living History, which
portrays preparations for Captain Scott's Antarctic voyage. Able Seaman
Lashly's uniform is seemingly causing headaches. ''The old photos are
black and white,'' she frets. ''I'm guessing that the uniform was navy,
although I'm told his kerchief was pale blue. I hope it's right.''
Actor Rab Buchanan, playing the Able Seaman, is less concerned about
accuracy and wants to know what to do with the ''woggle thing'' around
his neck. Through a mouthful of pins, Morton makes a terse suggestion .
. . This advice was surely never in the script -- but maybe it is a
costumier's privilege to offer it at times like these.

Pop superstar George Michael is in self-imposed exile after the well
publicised fall-out with record company Sony. Anvar Khan reports the
successful artist is taking steps to break his vow of silence and
eventually go it alone
I have no control or say in the way that my work is exploited
IN the 1980s, George Michael, the frankly hirsute member of Wham!, was
one of the biggest pop stars in the world. There are different calibres
of silence; moody, recalcitrant, intimidating, monastic and vengeful.
When George Michael fell out with his record company, Sony, he pled the
Fifth Amendment for five years. He refused to record another song for
them.
It was a dramatic, self-imposed exile. George Michael wrote and
produced two of the hits of the decade: Wake Me Up Before You Go Go and
Careless Whisper. If you're a success in Scotland you want to break
London, if you sell records in the UK you want to crack America. Talent
and ability become a matter of geography and association.
As a singer, Michael earned the ultimate accolade, he recorded a duet
with Aretha Franklin on the transatlantic No 1 Knew You Were Waiting. He
revelled in working with the music industry's most fearsome mamma.
Franklin is a music industry matriarch, a measure of credibility. In a
comparative version of Sir Norman Tebbit's Cricket Test, where British
Asians were invited to show their patriotism by supporting England
rather than Pakistan, George Michael took the soul test, holding his own
alongside the Queen Bee. Michael's admiration is a precious commodity,
which he lends to few, but only those he respects. He respects only
talent, and most of all he respects his own.
When he broke up with Wham! partner and long-term friend Andrew
Ridgeley, his first solo album, Faith, included four US No 1 singles. It
became the biggest selling album of 1988 in the US, and won him the
prestigious Ivor Novello Songwriting Award -- and a personal fortune of
about #80m. To understand why Michael decided to take on Sony, in the
face of such fame and riches, it's necessary to go back a few years.
In the seventies Sony launched the Betamax video. Although generally
recognised as a superior product, Betamax lost out to the VHS system
because Sony didn't own enough films to release on compatible tapes. The
company then vowed it would never develop a new electronic product
without owning the software as well. When it dawned there was going to
be a battle to succeed the compact disc, between Sony's Digital Audio
Tape and Philips' Digital Compact Cassette, the Japanese giant paid
$2000m for CBS Records which also had Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Bruce
Springsteen and Barbra Streisand on its books. It was to this episode in
Sony's career that George Michael later referred to in court, by saying
he was tired of ''being treated like little more than software''.
His complaints against Sony were, like the key players in the music
industry, major but few. While Faith sold 14,000,000 copies, the
precociously titled Listen Without Prejudice, sold 6,000,000. Sony
justified the poor sales by saying that Michael had refused to do any
promotional videos. Michael returned that Sony couldn't be bothered
pushing the album properly. They were embroiled in a tit-for-tat
argument. Neither party sought a compromise.
When they bought CBS, Sony inherited a pop star who was getting on a
bit in terms of self-expression. Dance routines were no longer important
to him. Michael wanted his day as a party boy to be a mere 24-hours in
history. He wanted the gravitas of an elder statesman. His sexual image
had to go.
Watching people become serious about themselves is a spectator sport.
They change the way they look, as if we're a nation of window-shoppers.
The catalogue of naff attempts presently includes Celtic manager Tommy
Burns in round, professorial spectacles; Carol Smillie swapping
wedding-cake dresses for jeans; Sam Fox, after breast reduction, in a
smaller bra. Accessorise for an instant brain injection, why don't you.
Michael's prime contention was that Sony treated him as a product
rather than an artist, which is the superstar equivalent of ''I am not a
number'' and ''My wife doesn't understand me''. Let's face it, they
probably didn't. Matters with Sony evenually came to a crisis point when
the singer accused them of failing to handle his work for an Aids
charity correctly. His cause was human, people before business. But he
was expecting Sony to do the PR for his social work.
Michael intended that his stance against Sony be interpreted as
standing up against the bullies. The court case was intended to
illustrate a fault in the way artists are treated in the music industry.
Michael attacked the long-term written contract. He was effectively
minced in the press for his complaint that his was a position of
''professional slavery''.
Artists, the self-proclaimed sensitive ones, anchor themselves to
impersonal business to become as famous as they want. Their work is the
product, not themselves. But somehow Michael believed that Sony had
stepped over that fine line. Artists need a ringmaster. Michael,
however, was originally signed up in 1982 when he was on the dole. He
does discipline the way other pop stars do drugs.
During the court case in 1994, it became apparent that Michael's views
of Sony's attitude, motives and competence derived less from first-hand
experience than from reports to him by his advisers, particularly his
manager Rob Kahane. Despite his concerns about the promotion of the
album Listen Without Prejudice, Michael never sought a meeting with the
relevant Sony executives.
Like the Aids-ribbon frequently on his lapel, publicising support for
an infection which still doesn't kill as many people as heart disease,
Michael seems to lack perspective. The judge said he could not help
feeling, that if Sony had seen more of the star rather than less of Mr
Kahane, events might have turned out differently.
As it was, George Michael told the company he wanted to be released
from his contract of six albums by 2003. He took a vow of silence which
meant immediate anonymity. His attempt to escape from his recording
contract was finally rejected by the High Court. The episode cost him
#3m. ''Even though I both created and paid for my work, I will never own
it or have any rights over it. I have no control or say in the way that
my work is exploited'', he said at the time, explaining that there was
no such thing as resignation for an artist in the music industry.
''Effectively, you sign a piece of paper at the beginning of your
career and you are expected to live with that decision, good or bad, for
the rest of your professional life.''
Sony is like any huge company which trades on artists. The talented,
high-earners subsidise the wage-slaves, their glamour justifies the
endless mediocrity. In signing with Virgin and Dreamworks SKG, Michael
has forgone the globally powerful Japanese for the best of American and
British business talent. In short, one self-made musician signs with
four entrepreneurs. It is significant.
He has left working for the company behind, to deal with people who
make commercial ''products'' as artists of a kind, whether it be films
or aeroplane rides. Stephen Spielberg, ex-Disney boss Jeffrey
Katzenberg, and Richard Branson all made it on their own too, on the
strength of the work they knew was good enough to make money, and they
all had the integrity of imagination. The pop star has awarded his
custom to men whose credentials he respects. It makes sense that George
Michael would trust fellow strugglers more.

AJACCIO: A French ferry strike which halted crossings to the holiday
island of Corsica for almost four days has been called off after unions
won job security pledges from the state-owned ferry operator. Officials
of the communist-led CGT union said crews had voted to go back to work.
Thousands reached the island yesterday after driving along the Riviera
coast to Italy and queueing overnight for places on ferries from Genoa.

New Orleans, Sunday
TWO cargo ships which collided in the Gulf of Mexico have created a
15-mile fuel slick as they have been drifting, locked together, in an
area studded with petroleum rigs.
The US Coast Guard did not want to pull the ships apart because one of
them, the Enif, could sink, said Petty Officer Tyler Johnson.
''It appears as if one of the ships is holding the other up,'' he
said. ''Our biggest concern is that the wreckage might drift into some
of the oil platforms.''
Tugs were brought in to stop the drift.
The Greek-flagged 750ft Alexia apparently rammed the Enif, out of
Singapore, on its port side. The Alexia was empty, while the 514ft Enif
was loaded with 1500 tons of steel.
No-one was hurt in the crash yesterday, about 70 miles south of New
Orleans. The cause of the collision was not immediately known.
Most of the Enif's crew was evacuated, as were nearby oil rigs. All 32
members of the Alexia's crew remained on board, and its engines were
used to control the drift away from an oil rig.
About 10,000 gallons of fuel leaked from the Enif, Coast Guard Captain
Gordon Marsh said. The Alexia's fuel was not leaking.--AP.

Tokyo, Sunday
AT least 36 people were taken to hospital after being overcome by
mystery fumes at a subway station in the port city of Yokohama today,
creating new poison gas worries for Japan.
The incident happened at Kamioka Station, 20 miles west of Tokyo, at
about 3pm (0600 GMT), a spokesman for the local fire department said.
All the victims were complaining of sore throats and pain in the eyes
but were not in a serious condition, the spokesman said. No specific
cause had been identified.
A police spokesman said no suspicious objects or materials had been
found.
Kyodo news agency said police closed an eight-storey department store
with two basements leading to an underground passage just outside the
station.
It quoted an employee at a supermarket in the basement as saying:
''There was no odour, but I suddenly felt pain in my throat and later my
eyes started to hurt.''
The police spokesman declined to speculate on whether the latest
incident was linked to the doomsday cult accused of involvement in the
March 20 sarin nerve gas attack on Tokyo subways that killed 11 people
and made 5500 ill.
''At present, we can't say whether Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth Sect)
was responsible for the incident,'' the spokesman said.
An Aum spokeswoman refused to comment on today's incident.
Cult leader Shoko Asahara and several top followers face murder and
attempted murder charges in connection with the Tokyo subway attack.
Since the March 20 attack, there have been incidents similar to that
in Yokohama, with people complaining of sore throats and burning eyes.
None has been firmly pinned to the sect.
On May 5, an apparent cyanide gas attack was thwarted at Tokyo's
busiest underground railway station, Shinjuku.
The cult was suspected of involvement in another sarin attack in a
mountain resort city last year, as well as the attempted assassination
of Japan's police chief on March 30. It has denied the allegations.
On Friday, Japanese authorities began formal moves aimed at disbanding
the cult.--Reuter.

Johannesburg, Sunday
FOUR miners killed by a fire more than a mile beneath the surface of a
South African goldmine died in a failed bid to rescue two colleagues
trapped behind a curtain of smoke, officials said today.
The fire at Gencor Ltd's St Helena mine, near the Free State town of
Welkom, had been isolated by early tonight and 100 miners were due to
resume work on the night shift at the Number Four shaft, about 2[1/2]
miles from the shaft where the fire started, they said.
Four of the miners died after running back through thick smoke to warn
colleagues further down an incline at the pit's Number Two shaft. The
men, and the two men they tried to save, were overcome as they tried to
get back above the smoke wall.
''The heroism and the selflessness of the . . . miners who ran back
through the smoke to warn their fellow workers serves as an inspiring
example to us all,'' Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha said
in a statement.
Andrew Davidson, spokesman for Gencor's mining division Gengold, told
Reuters the fire broke out in a disused stope about 5250ft underground
at the mine 150 miles southwest of Johannesburg.
He said four fire-fighting teams had sealed off the blaze site in the
shaft, which produced high-grade ore.
''The fire at Number Two shaft has been isolated . . . teams have
created a chimney within the mine so that the smoke can be channelled
out,'' he added.
''Some 100 workers will resume duty with the night shift this evening
at Number Four shaft which is . . . served with a separate ventilation
system,'' he said, adding that he did not have estimates of lost
production.
In the first three months of this year, the St Helena mine produced
3300lb of gold, making it the fifth largest producer out of Gengold's 10
mines.
Botha said the government was doing all it could to bring new mine
safety measures into force with the greatest urgency.
''We are striving to meet the risks inherent in mining with the most
effective safety measures that are humanly possible,'' Botha said in his
statement.
The accident is the latest in a series to hit South Africa's mining
industry, the mainstay of the country's economy.
On May 10, 104 miners were killed when an underground locomotive
plunged down Anglo American's Vaal Reefs gold mine shaft number two,
near the town of Orkney, crushing the lift cage carrying the men to
their night shift.--Reuter.

Erez, Gaza Strip, Sunday
THE PLO and Israel failed in marathon talks today to clinch an accord
on widening Palestinian self-rule but both sides said agreement was
still possible.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
spent the night on the border between Israel and PLO-ruled Gaza in an
attempt to meet their July 1 deadline for agreement on pulling back
Israeli troops from West Bank towns and villages.
''The night was not long enough,'' Peres told reporters. ''We did not
reach yet an agreement.''
A spokeswoman for Peres said he would meet Arafat again tomorrow or
Tuesday.
The missed deadline, one of many, was likely to increase tension in
the West Bank, where violent protests have erupted in the last week over
the release of Palestinian prisoners.
Peres and Arafat emerged looking haggard but with no evident animosity
between them after more than eight hours of talks which did not produce
even a joint statement.
A US official familiar with details of the talks said the next target
date for an accord was July 17.
Troop redeployment and elections for a Palestinian Council, envisaged
in the 1993 Israel-PLO peace deal that established Palestinian self-rule
in Gaza and the West Bank enclave of Jericho, are already a year behind
schedule.
After the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem today Israeli ministers
said that the talks were not in crisis.
''This isn't a crisis now but rather the last part of climb up a
mountain,'' negotiator and Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said. ''That
part, as you know, is always the steepest.''
PLO officials said the differences centred on security arrangements
after Israeli troops redeploy in the West Bank, home to one million
Palestinians and 100,000 Jewish settlers.
''What Israel is trying to do,'' said one PLO negotiator, ''is to
restrict the movements and deployment of the Palestinian police, and to
divide the West Bank in an attempt to avoid the establishment of a
Palestinian state at the end of the process.''
Israel rejected PLO demands to control security in villages and
refugee camps near Jewish settlements. It also opposed joint
Israeli-Palestinian patrols on roads to settlements, Israeli officials
said.
Arafat wants redeployment over two months from all major West Bank
towns, including Hebron which would have special security arrangements.
Redeployment would start four weeks after an agreement was signed. This
first phase would be completed 21 days before Palestinians elections.
PLO officials said Israel had agreed to pull back from major towns
although Ramallah and Bethlehem, both near Jerusalem, would not be
handed over fully until the completion of by-pass roads for settlers.
Peres said the talks were very complicated for both sides and he said
''some gaps'' remained. He refused to speculate when an agreement would
be signed.
* At least 19 people suffered from smoke inhalation as a huge fire
raged outside of Jerusalem today, whipped up by high winds, medical
officials said.
The flames spread quickly towards Jerusalem. The western outskirts of
the city were inundated with the smell of burning wood and ashes drifted
down onto the city's streets.

Seoul, Sunday
A 22-YEAR-OLD woman rescued today from the wreckage of a Seoul
department store four days after it collapsed died later in hospital,
dimming hopes of finding other survivors in the debris.
Hospital officials said Lee Eun-young's injuries were too serious to
save her. She was pulled from the wreckage of the five-storey Sampoong
Department Store on a stretcher, bleeding and exhausted with an oxygen
mask strapped to her face.
''It was very difficult to get her out. The space down there was too
narrow, too hot and full of gas,'' said rescue official Kim Wol-sil.
''The rescue took longer (than anticipated) as we had to cut through
the steel bars and widen the hole to take her out,'' he said.
She was the first person found alive today, after 24 were saved
yesterday. Her death took the official toll to 104, with 347 still
missing. Some rescue officials said they were resigned to the final
tally soaring beyond the 300 mark.
Lee's cousin Kwon Eun-jong, who was rescued on Friday, had urged
rescuers to dig through a supermarket area in the basement of the
building to search for her after rescue work was suspended for safety
reasons.
Rescue officials earlier said their greatest hope was signs of life in
a basement food outlet where up to 30 people may still be clinging to
life.
''The survivors are believed to be trapped in a Wendy's hamburger
restaurant,'' a rescue official told MBC television.
There were signs today that pent-up grief was turning to anger for
relatives waiting at the site in southern Seoul to hear of the fate of
loved ones missing in the debris.
Around 500 relatives scuffled with riot police after safety officials
ruled the wreckage unsafe, saying an elevator tower left standing when
the store collapsed on Thursday was beginning to tilt dangerously.
But early today the rescuers were allowed to resume the search for
survivors.
Preliminary investigation teams have blamed the collapse on shoddy
construction and negligence.
Prosecutors have charged the founder and president of the store and
two other executives for failing to order an evacuation although aware

Singapore, Sunday
A BRITON alleged to have murdered and mutilated his tourist victims
said in jail here this weekend that he was coming to terms with the fact
he will face the gallows.
John Scripps, 34, who admitted avoiding justice throughout a 20-year
life of crime, said: ''Whatever happens to me now is in the hands of
God. I know that Singaporeans are calling for death.''
Scripps has already asked for a Catholic priest after admitting he
killed South African Gerard Lowe whose dismembered body was found in
Singapore harbour last March.
He will be remanded in court again on Tuesday.
Scripps, 34, of Hertford, admitted in Taneh Merah Prison he had killed
engineer Gerard Lowe, 28.
Scripps says he will plead guilty to manslaughter, claiming that Lowe,
a brewery executive, had sexually assaulted him.
He has refused to talk about the murders of a Canadian mother and son
-- Sheila 45, and Darin Damude, 21 -- or about Briton Timothy McDowall,
who went missing in Mexico.

Kosice, Slovakia, Sunday
POPE John Paul paid tribute to Protestants killed by Catholics in the
17th century today as he made amends for perceived religious
insensitivity during his visit to Slovakia.
He spoke of ''praise and admiration'' for martyrs of all Christian
confessions after a service to confer sainthood on three Roman Catholic
priests tortured to death by Calvinist forces had alienated the minority
Slovak Evangelical churches.
Addressing the open air mass in the eastern city of Kosice, where the
three priests were killed in 1619 during the Thirty Years War, the Pope
told a huge crowd that Slovak Christians of various confessions had paid
for their faith with their lives.
He made special mention of 24 Calvinist pastors executed in the Slovak
town of Presov in 1687 by Catholic Habsburg forces, saying that the
Roman Catholic Church could not fail to acknowledge their ''spiritual
greatness''.
''To them and to all who accepted suffering and death out of fidelity
to the dictates of their conscience the Church gives praise and
expresses admiration,'' the Pope said.
He ater prayed at a monument to the 24 martyrs in Presov in an
unscheduled late addition to his four-day visit to strongly Catholic
Slovakia.
The stop, on the way to a meeting with Eastern rite Catholics in
Presov, was announced yesterday after several thousand Protestants had
gathered there to honour the 24.
They say they were upset that the Pope, who has set Christian unity a
goal of his reign, had not planned to acknowledge that Protestants as
well as Catholics died in the religious wars that swept central Europe
in the 17th century.
The Vatican denied the Pope had bowed to pressure from non-Catholics
by adding the visit to the Presov monument, saying that the idea had
come from the 75-year-old pontiff.
''He wants to help secure justice but also to heal historic wounds,''
chief spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls told reporters.
The Vatican was embarrassed in May when leading Czech Protestants
boycotted a meeting with the pontiff in Prague in a similar dispute over
the canonisation of a Catholic martyr.
The target then was Jan Sarkander, a Polish-born priest tortured to
death by Protestant noblemen in the 17th century.
The Pope responded at the time with an appeal to Catholics and
Protestants to forgive each other for what he called past sins and
errors on both sides.
Today's new saints were Marek Krizin, a Croat, Stefan Pongracz, a
Hungarian, and Melichar Grodziecky, from the Pope's native Poland.
Catholics from all three countries were among the crowds at the Kosice
service.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Sunday
BOSNIAN Serbs fired a mortar round at UN headquarters in Sarajevo
today and the mayor of the beleaguered capital said Bosnian government
forces would press on with an offensive to ease the Serb siege of the
city.
Three UN soldiers, including two Britons, were slightly wounded by
shrapnel when a mortar bomb exploded in trees next to the UN flagpole in
the compound. A local police guard at the United States embassy next
door was also slighty injured.
The building serves as UN peacekeeping headquarters in Bosnia and is
the residence of the UN commander in the country, Lieutenant-General
Rupert Smith of Britain.
Smith is on leave but the building was crowded with UN military and
civilian personnel when the mortar round struck.
The Bosnians said 25 people were wounded today after Serbs blasted the
city centre in intermittent attacks. On Saturday 13 people were killed
by the shelling.
Two Associated Press journalists were slightly hurt when two mortar
bombs fell near the UN compound about 45 minutes later.
Earlier in the day, French UN soldiers were targeted by a Serb heavy
machinegun as they left the city on the exposed road across Mount Igman,
a UN spokesman said.
After Bosnian Serb forces ignored a warning smoke shell, UN troops
fired two mortar rounds at the post and fire from it ceased when a round
landed within 20 yards. It was the first time UN forces used such force
near Sarajevo since deploying heavy combat weaponry after Nato air
strikes in May.
A heavy firefight broke out this afternoon around the Jewish cemetery
in the Bosnian capital with government and Bosnian Serb forces trading
machine-gun and artillery fire.
Sarajevo's mayor, meanwhile, said a Bosnian army offensive to ease the
Serbs' stranglehold was exacting a terrible price in casualties but it
represented his people's only hope. ''We will take the risk of fighting
for survival if the other option is surrender and survival,'' Mayor
Tarik Kupusovic told Reuters.
While the UN said the shelling was apparently unconnected with
offensive activity by Muslim-led forces, city dwellers were convinced
the attacks were revenge for successes by their army somewhere far from
the eyes of UN observers.
Bosnian state radio said government troops had advanced on high ground
north of the city towards the Serb-held town of Semizovac.
Mayor Kupusovic rejected the argument that the government had brought
unnecessary woes on its people, pointing out that shelling had
increased, water and power been cut off and all aid supplies blocked
before the offensive began.
In the Croatian capital Zagreb, EU peace envoy Carl Bildt said he had
discussed Serbian recognition of Bosnia with President Slobodan
Milosevic but emphasised he wanted Belgrade to do more to bring an end
to the war.--Reuter

A CROFTER was flown to hospital in Inverness after falling from cliffs
in a remote part of the Highlands while going to rescue a sheep. The man
suffered head and back injuries in the accident at Reiff, by
Achiltibuie. It is believed he fell about 10ft after scrambling down the
cliffs after the animal. A major rescue operation was mounted after the
alarm was raised with police. They contacted a local doctor and an
ambulance crew also raced to the scene. Due to the remoteness of the
area and access problems the Stornoway Coastguard rescue helicopter was
also scrambled. A winchman was lowered to the casualty while the chopper
landed on a nearby island to preserve fuel. The man was then flown to
Raigmore Hospital in Inverness where the extent of his injuries were not
known last night. Police were waiting to contact the man's next-of-kin
before releasing his name.

LOCAL telephone calls could soon be free under proposals drawn up by
BT to halt the drift of customers to its rivals.
The idea, already popular in the United States, is among a series put
to industry watchdog Oftel.
Subscribers opting for free calls which, at the cheapest rate,
currently cost 1p per minute, would pay a higher rental charge -- as
they do in the US.
''The essence of the proposals is flexibility,'' said a BT spokesman.
''We want to offer a variety of packages tailored to particular groups
of customers.
''One of the proposed packages involves free local calls. We are also
examining the possibility of different charging structures for different
regions, but we would ensure no existing customers would be
disadvantaged.''
The company is losing around 50,000 customers a month, mainly to new
cable companies which offer a combined telephone and television service.
But it has been barred from delivering live TV programmes through its
telephone lines as part of a deal to give the cable industry a flying
start.
The free calls scheme, which would appeal to small businesses and
those who spend a long time on the telephone to local friends and
neighbours, is one way for BT to fight back.
The company submitted its plans to Oftel in the spring, and a ruling
is due this month.

PIONEERING treatment has helped a mother recover from mouth cancer,
which is now affecting more than double the number of Scottish women
compared with 20 years ago.
Cancer Research figures reveal an increase from 41 to 96 cases a year
and for six out of 10 women the cause is unknown. Now doctors have
launched a drive to help patients spot it in time to save their lives.
Mrs Audrey Innes, a health visitor, was only 32 and newly pregnant
with her first child, Michael, now 15 months, when she discovered a
small lump on the floor of her mouth. ''Like most health workers, I
still held the belief that oral cancer was a disease of the elderly,''
she said.
''By the time Michael was born, the lump was big enough for me to be
worried enough to ask for a specialist's opinion. The surgeon at Paisley
Royal Alexandra Hospital took a biopsy and diagnosed cancer.''
Mrs Innes was transferred to the plastic surgery and head and neck
cancer unit unit at Canniesburn Hospital in Glasgow where surgeons
worked at removing the cancer and preserving her looks. Canniesburn
handles more than 25% of oral cancer patients in Scotland.
Pioneering work was carried out on nerve endings to ensure that she
retained sensation for eating. Mr David Souter, a consultant plastic
surgeon, said: ''The surgery took about seven hours because we had to
take out the tumour and the draining glands in the neck to where the
disease is most likely to spread.
''We then have to rebuild the mouth by taking tissue from Audrey's arm
to replace the lining of her mouth. To make the transplant successful,
we had to join the small vessels together using an operating microscope
and microsurgical skills. A nerve had to be carefully joined together to
ensure continued sensation in Audrey's mouth.''
Mrs Innes's treatment consisted of a combination of surgery and
radiotherapy. Speech therapy has allowed her to talk and eat again.
During that time, she lost more than two stones and survived on a diet
of food supplement drinks.
Doctors at Canniesburn are concerned about the rising number of women
with oral cancer, which was previously a disease of elderly men.
Consultant oncologist Dr Gerry Robertson said: ''It is vital to get your
GP or dentist to check any mouth ulcer, sore, or lump which has not
healed in four weeks. Teeth which fall out but where the socket refuses
to heal can be another early warning sign. Immediate diagnosis is
essential.''
''We do not know what causes this cancer in six out of 10 women and we
are very unhappy about the rise.''

<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by Scottish Natural Heritage to restrict the number of
dolphin cruises in the Moray Firth have run into opposition.
A new code of conduct seeks to have a maximum of four trips a day into
a ''sensitive'' part of the firth, where around 130 bottle-nosed
dolphins live.
But two Inverness-based cruise companies say the move could put them
out of business.
SNH drew up an accreditation scheme for boat operators last year to
protect the dolphins.
Both Moray Firth Cruises and McAulay Charters, which operate side by
side at Inverness Harbour, signed up to the scheme. Moray Firth Cruises
received a grant from Inverness and Nairn Enterprise only after getting
SNH backing for its operation.
But the code now includes a restriction to four trips a day in the
Kessock Narrows. Both firms run up to six trips a day into the firth.
Scott Gair, a partner in Moray Firth Cruises, said: ''We are totally
dumbfounded by this. On the one hand they have helped us set up, and on
the other they are trying to put us out of business. If we do as they
want and run only two trips a day we would go bust pretty quickly.''
John McAulay of McAulay Charters said the dolphins faced greater
problems from other shipping and from leisure boats and jet skiers.
''It seems we are an easy target. The dolphins are under greater
threat from increased use of leisure craft. It concerns me that two
creditable operators working in a sane and sensible way are being hit in
this way.''
The cruise firms claim that the restrictions on sailings are proposed
because noise from the boats could affect SNH-funded listening stations
where people can hear the dolphins ''talk'' via hydrophones.
Mr McAulay said: ''I believe the crux of this matter is the listening
stations. This is just as much about their commercial operation as it is
about dolphins.''
A spokesman for Inverness and Nairn Enterprise said: ''We are
concerned that the operators are not getting a fair crack of the whip.
They are quite happy to abide by the code of conduct, but it appears the
goalposts have been moved.
''Despite their best endeavours they are being asked to restrict their
activities to what most people would consider to be an unfair level.''
Ben Leishon, of SNH, said four trips a day was judged to be the best
precaution to limit disturbance. He suggested that any additional trips
should be made on a fixed route around the edge of the sensitive area,
and then concentrating on other parts of the firth.
He said 16 or 17 dolphins frequented the area, and were vulnerable to
all forms of disturbance. Four of the animals had died since 1990 before
reaching adulthood.
He agreed that boats might affect the listening stations. ''If there
are a number of boats near the dolphins for large parts of the day there
will be a visual and audible effect, and this could compromise an
extremely valuable land base.''

almost 500 people develop Alzheimer's disease or some other form of
dementia every day -- but many go undiagnosed for long periods and
receive help only in a crisis, according to a report published today.
However, Scotland is leading the way in improvements that will help
GPs to recognise the disease. Dunfermline West MP Mrs Rachel Squire has
put down an early day motion in Parliament which asks the Government to
recognise the importance of training for GPs and early diagnosis of the
disease.
The Alzheimer's Disease Society's Right from the Start report
estimates that 180,000 people in the United Kingdom are struck down by
dementia each year. A survey of 2000 carers and 700 family doctors also
highlighted widespread ignorance of the condition, says the document,
produced to mark the start of Alzheimer's Awareness Week.
The survey found that seven out of 10 GPs felt they had not received
adequate training in managing dementia, while fewer than one in four
carers thought their GPs had good knowledge of the disease. More than
half of GPs said they were dissatisfied with community care services.
The study also discovered that 5% of carers were more than 90 years old.
Alzheimer's Disease Society executive director Mr Harry Cayton said:
''Our surveys show that neither GPs nor carers are satisfied with the
way in which people with dementia are identified and supported in the
community. The number of people diagnosed is only the tip of the
iceberg, leaving people with dementia and their carers to cope until a
crisis forces recognition and help.''
The report's recommendations include:
* GPs to pay greater attention to the value of early diagnosis.
* A call for the Government to consider introducing incentives for GPs
to carry out health checks on 75-year-olds.
* GPs to improve links with other professionals and work with
voluntary organisations to support carers and sufferers.
Alzheimer's Scotland -- Action on Dementia (SAD) has joined the UK
campaign with the publication of a free booklet, Getting Help From Your
GP, on how to get help for sufferers and their carers. Ms Jan Killeen,
assistant director of public policy for SAD, said the campaign in
Scotland was one step ahead of the rest of the country, adding: ''We
have begun to address the issue of GPs' training at Alzheimer's
Scotland.'' The Dementia Services Development Centre at Stirling
University had also produced a training pack on dementia.
There are about 60,000 people with dementia in Scotland. Ms Killeen
said training and education were central to improvements in dementia
services, and added: ''It is important that GPs are alert so that early
support can be given.''
Mrs Squire, leader of Labour's Scottish task force on community care,
will apply for an adjournment debate on the issue, and said she would
also be seeking more resources for the primary health care sector.
The free 24-hour helpline for dementia advice in Scotland is 0800
317817.

SKIN specialist Professor Rona MacKie of Glasgow University will
present new research on the treatment of melanoma to the annual meeting
of the British Association of Dermatologists, at the SECC tomorrow.
The conference, which ends on Saturday, will also hear a reports from
Australia and America on the treatment and diagnosis of melanoma and
other skin diseases, including eczema and psoriasis.
Melanoma can take up to 20 years to develop after severe sunburn. It
is the second most common form of cancer in Scotland, affecting around
4400 each year.

ROBBIE the Pict has told Hollywood film stars profiting from Scottish
connections to put up or shut up. The campaigner for independence has
called on actors such as Sean Connery and stars from the current spate
of Scottish films to repay the nation by offering a bounty for the
return of the Stone of Destiny.
In the past two weeks the Pictish Free State founder has raised #1200
towards a reward for any Scot who can steal back the stone from its
current berth, beneath the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey. He
said the money had been raised ''from common folk'' and added: ''If this
is what ordinary people can come up with then surely the stars in their
ivory towers can do something.''
He added: ''The stone is a tangible symbol of the nation's
sovereignty. It should be a matter of principle for them: this is a
cultural, not political question.''
The ancient stone, upon which Scottish kings sat during their
coronation, was removed by the Edward I from Scone in 1296. Its origins
are suffused by myths, among which are that it is the biblical Jacob's
Pillow or that it was brought to Scotland by St Columba.However, some
historical accounts claim the Westminster one is a fake.
A famous raid took place on Christmas Day 1950, when a group stole the
stone and brought it back to Arbroath Abbey.
Sean Connery was unavailable to answer the appeal, but a spokeswoman
for United International Pictures, which distributed Rob Roy, said: ''It
sounds a very good cause and I do hope he succeeds, but Rob Roy has
already contributed a lot of money to the local economy.''
The Scottish Film Production Fund said the matter was more political
than filmic.

<HEADLINE>Professor paid bonus after treating fewer patients resigns in disgust. Royal surgeon in NHS attack</HEADLINE>

THE surgeon who operated on Prince Charles, after he broke his elbow
in a polo accident, yesterday criticised the Government's health reforms
and said he was quitting the NHS.
In the first of two major public attacks made on the eve of the
British Medical Association's annual conference in Harrogate, Professor
Christopher Colton claimed many of the reforms were ''more to do with
politics than patient care''.
''I am fed up,'' he said, claiming that at one stage he was awarded a
#20,000 bonus for agreeing to treat fewer people.
''In order not to exceed the targets, I had to close my children's
clinic for about four months and not have any referrals,'' he said.
''I was seeing so few people it meant another target was 100%
successful, in that nobody would have to wait longer than 30 minutes.''
The professor, who will be taking early retirement from his post at
the Nottingham University Hospital, said he was glad to be leaving the
NHS.
''I've had enough. I feel unhappy with the way the NHS is going. I
don't like the market pressures, and I don't like the fact that
decisions are being made about care, based upon market forces and not
necessarily on clinical need.''
His resignation came as the Bishop of Ripon chose the traditional
church service held before the conference to make his own attack. The Rt
Rev David Young said the NHS was now more concerned with its own
survival than long-term health care.
He warned the reforms were splitting apart the NHS and said changes
could cause chaos in the future. He told doctors in his sermon that the
fragmentation of health care was ''increasing rapidly in the culture of
competition.'' If it went on unchecked, he warned, ''chaos will ensue''.
The bishop said some of the central aims of the reforms, to increase
patient choice and allow the money to follow the patient, had not
materialised. He argued that, to some extent at least, a competitive
market struck at the root of the principle of caring.
''The increasingly competitive nature of health care is damaging.
Although lip service is given to the idea of co-operation between
trusts, the reality of the internal market requires competition,
secrecy, and fragmentation of historical links and exchange of clinical
expertise.''
Doctors are heading for another clash with the Government over plans
for hospital trusts to take over the training of future consultants.
The BMA will today debate an emergency motion calling on the
Government to revise the ''ill-judged and potentially destructive''
decision to have junior doctors employed directly by trusts.
The re-siting of junior doctors' contracts with trusts is due to take
place next April, when regional health authorities are scrapped. But
professional bodies across the spectrum of medicine have argued strongly
against the move, claiming it threatens the future of post-graduate
medical training.
Dr Mac Armstrong, BMA secretary, said: ''The Government has ignored
the advice of the juniors backed by the seniors, and all of the great
royal colleges. ''This great body of medical opinion has said this is
something that will not fly, this is something we advise you not to
do.''
Meanwhile, talks aimed at achieving a breakthrough in the bitter
health service pay dispute take place today, as the clock ticks towards
industrial action.
All hangs on the meeting between employers, NHS officials, and 13
unions who will try to resolve the row over the Government's offer of a
1% rise plus up to 2% to be negotiated locally.
The round-the-table talks -- the third to be held -- take place just
days before the start of the ballot process on strike action.
However, the unions' fight against locally determined pay was severely
undermined on Friday, when midwives opened the way for ''cash on
delivery'' productivity deals.
The decision by the Royal College of Midwives to accept a 1% national
award to be topped up in local negotiations shattered the fragile
coalition that exists between the unions, and earned widespread
condemnation. But midwives are still planning to join today's talks.

Nic Outterside takes a weekend reading from the man who remains the
most reliable barometer of political feeling on the Conservative right
BETWEEN the cream teas and an emergency executive meeting it was
business as usual for Eastwood Tories at the weekend.
At every level party activists are at one with their MP, Mr Allan
Stewart, in support for Prime Minister John Major in tomorrow's party
leadership election against former Welsh Secretary John Redwood.
However, although Mr Redwood is almost universally condemned as a man
''not up to the top job'', a stern warning to Mr Major came from this
most secure of all Scottish Conservative constituencies: ''Harden up
your act or we'll waste no time in choosing someone else.''
While Mr Michael Forsyth and Mr Michael Portillo pledge support for
the Prime Minister on the basis of their Cabinet positions, Mr Stewart
remains the most reliable barometer of political feeling on the right of
the Conservative Party.
He sees politics as a matter of pragmatism, and his pragmatic view is
that Mr Major is the one man who can continue to unite the party. Any
other option could be disastrous.
But he stressed that if Mr Major failed to reach the target needed to
secure the leadership a second ballot could provide a Pandora's box of
possibilities. The hint was obvious -- the result could be the return of
Mr Michael Heseltine as leader and Prime Minister.
Mr Stewart went back to Eastwood on Friday knowing he could rely on
the support of his constituency association. A special executive meeting
was called on Saturday morning at Rhuallan House, Giffnock. The party
hierarchy spent less than 50 minutes determining their advice to their
MP.
Chairman Ian Muir said there had been a ''full and frank'' discussion
but the executive had voted overwhelmingly to instruct Mr Stewart to
vote for Mr Major.
''We have in the past few years had some policies that have not been
totally acceptable or not very suitable to the grass roots,'' said Mr
Muir. ''But the overwhelming opinion is that John Major is the only
person who can unite the party and win the next General Election.''
Committee member Bill Cameron summed up the feeling of most of his
colleagues. ''I think Mr Stewart's views are as right-wing as anybody in
Eastwood, but we all feel for John Major and we don't want any change at
the moment,'' he said.
Mrs Muriel Mitchell added: ''I feel that John Major has had his
authority diluted and has spent all his time looking over his shoulder.
After Tuesday the party must get behind him and give him the authority
to win the next General Election.''
Ms Jean Hamilton -- a former constituency chair for Sir Teddy Taylor
-- said: ''I think Europe is the key to this. I am not for Europe, but
at the same time I think Major has done the best for us whereas Redwood
would have us out and that would be disaster, no matter how we feel
about the EU's shortcomings.''
Mr Stewart's day had begun with a spread of unity, but there was a lot
of policy-crunching to come. A short car journey and he was back at his
Neilston home -- an 1830s mill owner's house set in a couple of acres of
well-tended rural garden.
The sun drenched a private patio and amid budding lavender plants,
cold Australian Chardonnay, and crusty ham rolls -- served by his wife
Susie -- the MP ventured his views on the state of his party.
Two months ago he warned that the Government could suffer an electoral
wipe-out in Scotland if changes were not made on essential policy.
But Mr Stewart sees the Prime Minister as the best and only man
capable of carrying acceptable policy changes forward.
On Saturday he expanded: ''I believe governments have got to develop
policies. That doesn't necessarily mean radical changes -- but times
change and you need to change policies with them.''
He supported an increase in mortgage tax relief to help combat the
stagnation and negative equity evident in the housing market. ''There is
a need to put up the percentage rate on mortgage tax relief across the
board if we are to regenerate demand and help first-time buyers.
''A move on tax relief would also push house prices up and address the
problem of negative equity, which has become a problem in many other
parts of the country.''
Taxation is another primary issue he believes must be addressed if the
Conservative Party is to win back the voters who have deserted it in
droves during the past three years.
''You can put up a good argument for VAT on domestic fuel at half the
standard rate,'' he said, ''and I would now be inclined for the
Government to announce that the position is one which will not be
changed.''
But the MP admitted that a tricky problem existed in finding a
''painless way'' to raise extra revenue for the Government to fund tax
cuts, admitting that VAT on newspapers and children's clothes would not
yield a satisfactory return.
He said that an increase of the standard rate of VAT to 20% would be
one method that could be considered. ''It would be inflationary in the
immediate term because it would raise prices, but it is not necessarily
inflationary in the medium term as it takes money out of the economy.
''I would personally be slightly more relaxed about the inflation
target anyway. The 2.75% is an extraordinarily tight inflation target
and we could cope with an extra point on that.''
Care in the community is another issue where Mr Stewart believes his
party has come adrift of its electorate. ''The main problem seems to be
because it is delivered through local authorities and its implementation
is out of direct control of the Government.
''It's not a case of going into reverse, but there are horror stories,
such as instances where people have had to sell their houses to pay for
care and these need to be addressed. We need to look a lot harder at the
respective roles of the local authority sector, the voluntary sector,
and private sector and work out how their roles can be supported and
developed. But any changes must be carried out in a kind of pragmatic,
practical way.''
Mr Stewart also moved quickly to shift two of Mr Redwood's primary
election planks. He dismissed Europe as a pressing policy issue. ''I am
happy with the Prime Minister's policy of delaying the decision on a
single currency now. Parliament can decide when the time comes and we
can also keep the options open for a referendum. That's a reasonable and
pragmatic line to take.''
He added that the party now needed to put aside its own internal
debate on Europe and begin drawing demarcation lines over where it
differs from Labour. ''The single issue of Europe should not be one
which determines the leadership of the party or the Prime Minister of
the country.''
The second promise of Mr Redwood to stamp down on sleaze by screening
every Minister was dismissed as being fraught with difficulty.
''Who are you going to get to do the screening?'' asked Mr Stewart.
''Mr Redwood said he would call people in and ask them questions. But
nobody is going to say: 'Oh, by the way, I've got two broads on the side
and have my heroin every second Tuesday'.''
Turning to the leadership election, he said Mr Redwood's decision to
stand came as a ''complete surprise''. He believed there was an initial
knee-jerk reaction to support the contender but that support had
''noticeably waned'' as Mr Redwood's credentials were exposed.
There is a feeling of close loyalty between Mr Stewart and the Prime
Minister. He harks back to the mid-1970s when the two of them were both
active within the Beckenham constituency Conservative association.
However, he believes that Mr Major needs to develop a harder streak
and cites last week's meeting with the 60 Euro-sceptics and his loyalty
to David Mellor as two instances that were mishandled -- things Mrs
Thatcher would never have tolerated.
Lunch was soon over and it was time to face the constituents once
again. This time a Tory cream tea in the home of a party activist in the
Clarkston ward. The supporters had time to relax over their meringues
and strawberries and pass more thoughtful comment on the party's
problems.
''We will support the Prime Minister. However, if he does not get the
sufficient votes he needs to continue then Michael Portillo will get a
lot of votes,'' says businessman Malcolm Mulheron.
''If Major wins he must listen to the views of Mr Redwood's supporters
and take those views on board and act upon them . . . he can't afford to
cut off one wing of the party.''
Bunty McDowall believed Mr Major's decision to resign and force a
leadership challenge was ''a mistake in hindsight'' but agreed he had to
take action on internal bickering.
''Even if he wins on Tuesday I don't believe he will stop the
infighting. I don't think the whole bang-shoot augurs very well for the
next General Election,'' she added.
The same resignation was reflected by Mr Fraser MacIntosh, who
admitted that Mr Michael Heseltine would be his choice on a second
ballot. ''My honest opinion is that if Redwood was to win it would not
only be a disaster for the party but for the country as a whole.
''We must look ahead. What's hapening now is what happened to the
Labour Party a few years ago . . . we're tearing ourselves apart.''
Opinions, like the weather, cooled. Mr Stewart, asked by one party
activist whether he had changed his mind and would support John Redwood,
quipped: ''Aw no, we're all backing Ted Heath in the second ballot, then
we can give everything away to Europe.''
The fear of the Pandora's box is never far away.

MAVERICK Scottish MP Bill Walker survived an emergency meeting of his
constituency party yesterday, over his support for the Tory leadership
challenger John Redwood.
Despite a call for his deselection and strong opposition to his
support for Mr Redwood, he emerged unscathed.
He said: ''I anticipate I will be the candidate (for Tayside North).
Of course, I accept that will depend on getting the support of the party
activists and party workers, and that's the majority that have to
support me.''
Opinion at the ''lively'' emergency meeting of the Tayside North
party's executive over Mr Walker's stance was ''evenly divided'', and
the MP admitted that strong views were expressed on each side.
Before the meeting, which was attended by around 40 activists,
constituency deputy chairman Charles Cormack said: ''I'm sure some
people are discontented. Obviously he's upset quite a few people, that's
the nature of the beast.''
But Mr Walker and constituency chairman Michael MacPhail presented a
united front after the meeting in a Blairgowrie hotel.
Mr MacPhail said: ''Everybody had points to make. There was, of
course, different opinions expressed, but we welcome that. Ultimately, I
think it will go on to show that we are united in North Tayside.
''Obviously, a leadership election, any election, makes for some
degree of division, and some controversy. Politics is more interesting
as a consequence.''
Mr MacPhail explained that under Scottish Conservative rules, Mr
Walker had the right to back ''whosoever he may wish to support'', and
added that it would be incorrect if Mr Walker's stance led to his
deselection.
Mr Walker welcomed the outcome of the meeting and said that he was
still absolutely behind Mr Redwood.

SENIOR Labour figures last night demanded Government responses to
allegations in a newspaper that a company owned by a leading Tory
fund-raiser in Scotland owes more than #1.2m to the public purse for
property deals done in the 1980s.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said the claims, involving
Glasgow businessman Mr Jack Harvie, should be the subject of a full
inquiry by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
Shadow trade and industry spokesman Brian Wilson said he would be
tabling questions in the Commons.
An article in Scotland on Sunday suggested that City Link Developments
-- owned by Mr Harvie, who organises lucrative annual dinners for the
Conservative Party in Scotland -- bought two properties from the former
Scottish Development Agency in 1987 and 1988.
He is alleged to have purchased Merlin House, an office block on the
Hillington industrial estate, for #850,000, in 1987, yet has paid only
#125,000 to date.
The following year, he is said to have bought a 10-acre site nearby
for #550,000, but has so far paid only 10%.
It is understood that the outstanding sum, in excess of #1.2m, is
registered as a loan in the latest published accounts of Scottish
Enterprise, which succeeded the SDA.
A Scottish Enterprise spokesman said the agency was completely
satisfied that there was ''no case to answer'' and that any inquiry
would show ''the high standards of professional business practice and
general integrity of all parties involved''.
Agency insiders are thought to regard yesterday's newspaper article as
politically motivated and selective in its use of facts. It is
understood that other companies have larger ''debts'' with the country's
main industrial aid body, which is subjected to regular auditing
scrutiny.
However, Labour's Mr Robertson said that, apart from demanding answers
from Mr Lang, he had also written to Professor Donald Mackay, chairman
of Scottish Enterprise, asking if interest had been paid on the
outstanding amount; and to Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the Public
Accounts Committee, requesting him to investigate.
He said: ''Serious questions are posed by these land sales and, given
Mr Harvie's close links to the Scottish Tory party, it is essential that
Ian Lang clarifies the picture right away.''
''He has responsibility for Scottish Enterprise, and he personally
must explain why any company should get preferential terms with valuable
public assets.
Mr Harvie, who received the CBE in the 1992 New Year's Honours List,
could not be contacted yesterday at his home in Mugdock, near Milngavie.
But Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party,
leapt to his defence, claiming the Scotland on Sunday article was
''seriously flawed by inaccuracies, half-truths, bias and innuendo''.
He said he believed nothing illegal or dishonourable had occurred.
Sir Michael added: ''Not surprisingly, the article makes no reference
to the fact that Jack Harvie has, from scratch, built up businesses
which now employ nearly 1500 people. Scotland would benefit enormously
from a lot more successful entrepreneurs like him.''

SCOTLAND has never had it so good on the cinema screen. This weekend
they have been fighting Bannockburn all over again. It seemed like going
from the sublime to the ridiculous, turning from watching the cast of
thousands being slaughtered in the battle scenes of Mel Gibson's epic
film Braveheart about William Wallace -- there are probably more people
on screen fighting than there were in all of thirteenth century Scotland
-- to viewing the cast of around 150 extras doing the same in The Bruce.
The two films are at the opposite ends of the film-making spectrum.
The Bruce, directed by Bob Carruthers, who made Chasing the Deer, is
largely financed by the public who, if they take shares, get the chance
to appear in it and their names in the end credits. One, a member of the
Anglo-Scottish squirearchy, told a chum watching the filming on
Saturday: ''It is what they call a low-budget film. I don't know why I'm
here. I just got the urge.''
But does this rewriting of history matter? Rob Roy, the most recent
Scots epic, took a swipe at the truth, much to the annoyance of those
who believe they know what it is.
In Gibson's Braveheart, Wallace wages his battles in selected Highland
or Irish beauty spots, not the dreary Lowlands, marries a lady called
Murren, a very odd name indeed, and romances the Princess of Wales. Does
it matter if, as here, the history is bunk? Only if those watching the
result take it as gospel. Brought up in Lanark in the belief that
Wallace could remotely look like the whitewashed figure in a skirt, and
wrap-around plaid, with a First World War tin hat and crown on his head,
on the front of the parish kirk, I was reared on largely imaginary
history.
But the Wallace story, provided one knows that much of it is legend,
only a little historical fact, gave the town a sense of its past, which
is what matters. Unfortunately, Braveheart, while being thrilling,
paints a world not remotely like thirteenth century Scotland. Given the
way history is taught in schools today, that is a pity.
How does Robert the Bruce, planned to ride along on the slipstream of
Braveheart, fare?
Historically, not all that well, but the makers' hearts are in the
right place in a film about freedom from English domination. Bannockburn
was re-fought over the weekend at Neidpath Castle outside Peebles, with
the Tweed standing in for the silvery Tay. It proved to be two days of
crises, some great, some small, involving much standing about for the
100-odd extras who played both the Scots and English armies.
Carruthers, sporting a Glengarry with a feather and a black The Bruce
T-shirt costing #10, summed things up at one moment of high tension. His
explicit instructions from on high were being wantonly disobeyed down
below. ''I think you start speaking Japanese when you start making a
film. I really do,'' he sighed. ''It is like bloody Hampden Park down
there.''
The extras may have found it tedious but it was not much fun for the
actors who had to do even more waiting. Edward I, played by Brian
Blessed, spent most of his time letting small boys take his photograph
and explaining: ''I am Edward I, Hammer of the Scots, a very cruel great
king who beat Bruce seven times and I am directing the English acting
scenes as well as acting.''
The small boys seemed surprised. Should you wonder why Edward I was at
Bannockburn, it was partly because they had some additional shots to
take of Blessed with an army behind him, partly, action being
Carruthers's specialty, so he could direct some of the scenes.
Unfortunately, somehow they kept never quite getting round to them.
This drove Edward II, played by Richard Brimblecombe, into quite a
tizzy as he was made to get on his horse, having just been told to get
off. ''I have been here since eight this morning and this is the first
thing I have actually done and it is wrong,'' he said. ''How do I know
what to do if they won't tell me? I'm not a mind reader.''
He is there as the sex appeal because, as Blessed admitted, the rest
of the cast are far from pretty. Bruce (Sandy Walsh) has designer
stubble, wears an orange fright wig, and will cause Mel Gibson no
worries.
''Oliver Reed is pretty ugly these days and I am what you might call a
rough-hewn Ulysses. Richard is handsome, the women swoon for him, so I
am making the character of Edward II stronger,'' proclaimed Blessed as
he rehearsed his colleagues in those scenes they never got round to
filming.

<TEXT>
MORE and more husbands are cheating on their wives, a marriage expert
claims today.
In a new book, The Trouble With You, therapist Mrs Zelda West-Meads
estimates that 60% of married men are having affairs.
The numbers could hit three out of four if trends continue, she said.
Some husbands wait just six months after exchanging vows before
straying.
However, the phenomenon is not restricted to men only. Based on recent
research from magazines, books, and a paper from the Institute of
Marital Studies, Mrs West-Meads said 40% of women were also fooling
around.
The author, who has counselled couples with marriage guidance group
Relate for 20 years, said the rapid growth in adultery in Britain
mirrors a rise in infidelity in the United States.
There, expectations about the pleasures of marriage are higher and
divorce is more socially accepted, she said.
''Many philandering husbands and straying wives convince themselves
that adultery is actually good for their marriages,'' she said.
''They believe it does no harm as long as it remains a secret. Some
feel an affair is a way of staying together rather than seeking divorce.
''But really it's frequently just an excuse to have their cake and eat
it without ever trying to get to grips with what is wrong in their own
marriages,'' she said.
The book also reveals that one affair often leads to another and those
who were promiscuous before marriage often end up unable to settle down
when wedded.
''Once you have been used to having a variety of sexual partners, it's
more difficult to give up,'' she said.

A RECORD was claimed by an Edinburgh family yesterday as its sixth son
became a full member of the choir at St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral,
following in the footsteps of his five brothers.
Michael Wood, eight, from Craigmount Avenue North in the city's
Drumbrae area, donned his surplice and became a full chorister after
having served as a probationer in the choir for the past 18 months.
The remarkable achievements of the sons of Carol and Bill Wood began
in 1981 when their eldest son, Martin, began as a chorister at St
Mary's.
Martin, now 22, Stuart, 20, William, 16, and Mark, 15, have all been
head choristers.
Michael Wood joins his brother Stephen, 10, also a chorister. The
brothers celebrated at a lunchtime party yesterday.
Mrs Wood had no explanation for her family's talents yesterday. But
one clue could lie in the fact that she is a great-niece of Louis Levy,
who composed music for films and had an orchestra that played for George
VI.

NEARLY half of UK businesses oppose a single European currency,
according to a survey published today.
The research, by the Forum of Private Businesses which represents
23,000 independent UK firms, shows 47% against a single currency.
However, one in five businesses were ''undecided''. The survey also
found an overwhelming 71% against faster European integration.
A regional breakdown shows that Scottish opposition to a single
European currency almost matches the UK average. But Scottish opposition
to faster European integration is lower.
Forum Scottish spokesman Mr Jim Gorie said the results confirmed Scots
were outward-looking, though this was tempered by the currency issue.
He added: ''There is a much higher complacency and ignorance towards
Europe down south, particularly in middle England.
''Scottish business is much more informed and interested, but there is
a great nervousness that we might be less competitive under a single
European currency.
''There is still a residue of caution that if there is a level
playing-field, Scotland might suffer particularly if it has strings such
as a minimum wage.''
Across the UK, the report shows a significant draining of support for
a single currency, which stood at 59% prior to the Maastricht summit in
1991.
Sectors most strongly opposed were agriculture, construction and
manufacturing, where businesses felt a single currency might affect raw
material costs.
The FPB forum survey also shows two out of three in the business
community now want a referendum on the Government's European policy.
This compares to 33% who wanted a similar vote this at the time of
Maastricht.

THE Archbishop of Canterbury watched with pride as his son followed in
his footsteps yesterday, at Wakefield Cathedral.
At a special ceremony watched by 700 people, Dr George Carey saw his
30-year-old son Mark ordained as a priest.
However, Dr Carey admitted it was a day he thought he would never see.
''I was surprised when he told me he wanted to be a priest. I am
delighted and very proud of Mark, and I am sure he is going to be a very
fine priest.''
Mark Carey, who accepted the cloth in a two-hour ceremony watched by
wife Penny, 32, and mother Eileen, left a job as a social worker and
manager of a children's home in Avon to join the ministry. He has been
curate of Christ Church at South Ossett, in the Wakefield diocese, for
more than a year.
''When I started out in social work I didn't want to be a priest, and
I had to think very carefully about following my dad,'' he said.
''But in the end God made me join the church. This is what I want to
do, and I am very happy.''

<HEADLINE>Tour firm could face death charge. Police probe Thomson holiday tragedy</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TOUR operator Thomson could be charged with corporate manslaughter
over the death last October of a holidaymaker in Spain, it emerged
yesterday.
Following a request by a coroner, police are investigating the death
from carbon monoxide poisoning of Miss Janet Smith at Veramar holiday
apartments, Fuengirola, during a week-long break booked through Thomson
Tour Operators.
Miss Smith, 31, of Hornchurch, Essex, who was sharing her apartment
with friends Linsey Moore and Sharon Fisher, was exposed to high levels
of carbon monoxide, believed to have come from a faulty water heater.
Her friends, who were part of a group of mentally-handicapped
holidaymakers, recovered after four days in intensive care.
Waltham Forest coroner Harold Price opened an inquest but adjourned it
to allow the police investigation to be carried out.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ''It is alleged that the carbon
monoxide poisoning was caused by defective water heaters, and that
Thomson Tour Operators knew about the defective heaters prior to the
holiday booking.''
A spokeswoman for Thomson said: ''We take the responsibility for the
safety of our customers extremely seriously.
''It would be wholly inappropriate for us to comment on the tragic
death of Janet Smith while the Spanish authorities continue their
inquiries and before the UK coroner has conducted an inquest.''
A corporate manslaughter charge is rare in Britain. Eight defendants,
including ferry company Townsend Thorensen and three former directors,
were acquitted in 1990 over the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, when
193 people died in 1987.
The managing director of an activity centre was jailed for three years
in 1994, after four teenagers died in the Lyme Bay canoeing tragedy.
* Striking Greek seamen have promised to end a walkout that has halted
ferry traffic to the Aegean islands, stranding thousands of tourists.
''We will end this strike on Monday,'' said Mr John Halas, secretary
general of the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation. ''We will then consider
renewing action if there is no progress in our talks with the
government.''
The strike, to press their demands for higher pensions and lower
taxes, has stranded at least 10,000 tourists -- some Britons -- in ports
around the country, and virtually halted seaborne traffic between the
mainland and the islands.
Piraeus, Greece's largest commercial and passenger port, looked like a
refugee camp, with foreign tourists sleeping on the docks. Others slept
in the grounds of Athens international airport, awaiting a place on a
charter flight.
At the port, trucks carrying supplies for the islands backed up at
Piraeus as perishables rotted in the sun. The strike has hurt the
country's many islands, which get most of their supplies by sea.
Union leaders said that although the strike had been nearly 100%
successful, the government was not willing to satisfy their demands.
''Participation so far in the strike is total. No passenger ships have
left port,'' Halas said.
The socialist government has repeated a pledge made in March that it
would raise minimum pensions in 1996. It also said it would try to deal
with pension fund problems in the budget for that year.
A spokesman for Thomson said none of the hundreds of people on its
holidays in the Greek islands this weekend had been hit by the strike.
''In the places affected we have arranged hydrofoils or chartered our
own boats, so our customers have not had to change any travel
arrangements,'' said a spokeswoman for the tour operator.
Meanwhile, a sharp earth tremor struck yesterday near the
quake-battered Greek port of Egion, but officials reported no injuries
or serious damage.
The town was hit by a major quake on June 15, that left 26 dead and
over 60 injured. Most of the dead were in a block of flats and a hotel
that collapsed.
The Athens Geodynamic Institute said the tremor measured 4.5 on the
Richter scale, with its epicentre in the Gulf of Corinth, 90 miles
south-west of Athens.

PROPOSALS requiring job applicants to produce an official certificate
stating whether they have a criminal record, and costing them #5, are
set to be published by the Government later this year.
A draft White Paper, due to be unveiled at the Tory Party conference
in October, would allow a large section of employers access to a
computer, currently at Scotland Yard, containing applicants'
convictions.
Those looking for work in the ''most sensitive areas of employment''
will have to submit to ''full criminal record checks'' with a new
privatised Criminal Justice Record System, known as Phoenix.
This will reveal not only recent unspent convictions, but details of
offences committed in the distant past, according to a confidential
Whitehall paper obtained by a Sunday newspaper.
The Home Office said yesterday that Home Secretary Michael Howard
''could certainly mention this at the Tory conference'', but a spokesman
would neither confirm nor deny that the certificate would cost job
applicants #5.
''We cannot go into details until the White Paper is published,'' he
said.
The Scottish Office said it was ''aware of the Home Office work in
this area and it is a matter which is also under consideration by the
Scottish Office.''
A spokesman was also unable to talk in detail about the proposals, but
added that the Scottish Office was looking at how arrangements could be
put into place ''which best reflect Scottish circumstances''.
Childcare employers already have full access to criminal records, but
the White Paper introduces many new categories of employers who can vet
applicants.
These are understood to include teachers, probation officers, social
workers, health staff, opticians, dentists, osteopaths, chiropractors,
vets, pharmacists, managers of clinics or nursing homes, accountants,
lawyers, and legal executives.
National lottery ticket-sellers, firefighters, and managers of banks,
building societies, and insurance companies are also included.
The second category -- all other employers -- would be entitled to
insist that job applicants present a ''criminal conviction certificate''
-- a computer printout recording whether they have ''unspent
convictions'' together with details of any offences committed.
A Bill containing the plans could be introduced in the next
parliamentary session.
According to the Observer, job applicants will have to pay #5 for the
certificate, even if they have no convictions.
It quotes the White Paper as stating: ''The criminal conviction
certificates should alert employers to individuals with a recent and/or
very serious convictions on their record, but should not prejudice the
prospects of those who have committed offences incurring long prison
sentences and who have reformed.''
Mr Alan Miller, chairman of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties,
said yesterday that, while the criminal convictions of people seeking
jobs in sensitive areas of work such as childcare had to be considered,
he would be concerned about matters of confidentiality affecting people
seeking jobs in less sensitive areas.
''It seems to be an extension beyond the previous situation covering
people working with children, and I think it's an extension too far.
''It is also shifting the onus on to the employee to get the
certificate, and some of the jobs to which this applies don't seem at
all appropriate.''
Mr Miller added: ''If you have increased access to police criminal
records, we would have concern about what other use or abuse that could
be put to.
''The whole point of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act is that
people should get over their offences and be rehabilitated into society,
so we would be concerned that old convictions were dragged up and
prejudiced someone from getting a job.
''People should be able to reintegrate into society without having
these held against them.
''I would like to know what the reason for this move is. Our concern
is that a lot of these kind of moves arise from Conservative Party
conferences and pressure to appease Tories and come up with something
new rather than the perceived need to introduce things.''

THE charities Shelter and the Scottish Council for Single Homeless
yesterday urged the Scottish Office to widen the safety net for
youngsters leaving local authority care.
Their last-ditch appeal comes two days before the Children (Scotland)
Bill is debated in the House of Lords.
At present, the legislation proposes that councils should provide
after-care support for children up to their 19th birthday, and the
Government has rejected amendments that this should be extended to the
age of 21.
However, both Shelter and the SCSH argued yesterday that the increase
had backing from across the political spectrum, and from many child-care
groups, including Barnardo's, the Scottish Child Law Centre, and the
Association of Directors of Social work.
They also quoted Tory MP Phil Gallie, who told a Commons committee
during an earlier reading of the Bill: ''I have some sympathy for the
argument. A youngster between the ages of 19 and 21 still needs
support.''
Shelter spokesman Michael Thain pointed out that recent legislation
for Northern Ireland had given individuals rights to after-care support
until they were 21.
He said: ''Young people who have been in local authority care are 70
times more likely to become homeless than other young people. We have
asked for a minimal concession from the Government to ensure that young
people are helped through an extremely difficult time in their lives.''

GEESE are the reason why Argyll and Bute District Council will this
week be advised to refuse permission for a wind farm.
Director of planning George Harper will recommend that Trigen
(Kintyre) Ltd's plan to build a 25-turbine wind farm at Largie Estate,
Kintyre, be turned down because of fears that it could interfere with
Greenland white-fronted geese which winter in the area.
Each of the turbines is to be 62 metres high, and both the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Natural Heritage fear
that the geese, which have special protection status under an EC
directive, might fly into them and be killed.
The proposal has also prompted local concern over visual impact and
noise, but it is clearly the goose factor which perturbs Mr Harper.
In a report to his council's planning committee this week, he states
that the planned site lies between a Site of Special Scientific
Interest, where internationally important numbers of the geese feed, and
lochs to the east where the birds roost.

<HEADLINE>Number of 19-year-olds staying-on in education increases with jobs slump</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977584356</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE number of Scottish 19-year-olds going on to higher education has
more than doubled over the last eight years, mainly because of reduced
employment opportunities for school-leavers.
The finding is contained in a report by the Centre for Educational
Sociology at Edinburgh University, published today, which says that most
pupils are staying on at school in the hope of going to university.
But social class remains an important factor in progress to tertiary
education. The Government's overhaul of Scottish secondary education,
Higher Still, which aims to cater for the growing numbers of children
staying on after 16, will have to cater for all social classes and meet
their employment and training needs, says the report.
The findings are based on the Scottish Young People's Survey, a
regular postal survey of school-leavers and year groups to provide a
picture of participation trends among 16 to 19-year-olds in education
and training.
The analysis, based on data collected from samples of 16-year-olds
between 1985 and 1991 followed over a 30-month period, shows that
participation in higher education rose from 16% of 19-year-olds in 1987
to 31% in 1993.
The proportion who stayed in full-time education after 16 rose from
46% to 58%, an increase offset by a fall in full-time employment.
There was also a decline in unemployment among 16-year-olds and the
centre says this might be partly explained by benefit changes in 1988
which ruled out unemployment as an option for the under-18s.
Over the survey period, the proportion of 19-year-olds in full-time
work fell from 59% to 41% while unemployment remained stable at about
12%.
''Changes in the labour market, and in higher education, have weakened
the 'pull' of young people out of education at 16 and increased the
incentives to stay on,'' says the report.
In a finding which will be of particular interest to educationists and
secondary headteachers, the data shows that what young people do after
16 is less dependent than before on the fourth-year qualifications they
obtain.
The fastest increase in participation in fifth and sixth years, and in
further and higher education, occurred in the group with the lowest
fourth-year attainment, and more girls than boys participated in these
four ''educational'' routes.
The data also show significant differences in participation between
young people from working and middle-class backgrounds.
According to the most recent group of young people suryeved, the
proportion going on to higher education from non-manual backgrounds was
58%, while for those from manual backgrounds it was 20%.
Professor David Raffe, who worked on the survey with colleague Paula
Surridge, said: ''Staying on rates have risen fastest among the
least-qualified 16-year-olds, and this trend should continue if Higher
Still fulfils its promise to offer 'opportunity for all'.
''One of the biggest challenges for Higher Still will be to satisfy
the needs and aspirations of those aiming for university, while also
providing worthwhile routes into employment and occupational training.''

MARKS and Spencer is refusing to take part in the first trial of a
revolutionary new payment card.
M&amp;S will be the only major store not involved in the trial of the
Mondex card which begins in Swindon, Wiltshire, today.
Mondex -- invented by the NatWest bank -- is the latest in plastic
smart cards and the biggest step so far down the road to the cashless
society.
It can be electronically charged with cash and allows the holder to
shop without coins or notes.
NatWest, the Midland and British Telecom, which jointly developed the
project, persuaded hundreds of shops in Swindon to take part in a trial
over the next one to two years.
But M&amp;S, which only began to accept debit cards in May, is standing
back -- to the disappointment of the trial's organisers.
''They have a history of being very cautious about these things and we
have to respect that,'' said a Mondex spokesman.
M&amp;S said its priority was to gear all stores to accept debit cards.
''We have looked at Mondex and we do not rule it out for the future,''
said an M&amp;S spokeswoman. ''It's simply that our priority at the moment
is to press on with Switch and Visa Delta cards as fast as possible.''
Mondex cards contain a microchip which allows users to charge them up
with cash at NatWest or Midland hole-in-the-wall machines or over the
telephone.
They are then swiped through a shop terminal and payments docked from
the card.

<TEXT>
A 70-YEAR-OLD man died yesterday after he was turned into a human
fireball in front of horrified wedding guests.
Church gardener Mr Arthur Handy was engulfed by flames moments before
the wedding ceremony began when he turned on a shed light after filling
a lawn mower with petrol.
Members of the congregation smothered him with morning suits and a
blanket as he staggered from the outbuilding in agony.
Mr Handy was taken to hospital and later transferred to a special
intensive care unit but died nine hours later.
The tragedy happened at the weekend at St Jude's Church, South
Shields, Tyne and Wear, just before Miss Joanne Bailey, 25, and Mr
Joseph Goss, 27, were to be married.
The bride was not told about it until after the ceremony.
Mr Handy was about to mow the lawn, before the wedding photos were
taken, and he had taken a can of petrol into the shed.
Safety officer Mr Colin Kennedy, 39, who helped to smother the fire
with a blanket said: ''It was a terrible thing to happen on what should
have been a happy day.''
His wife, Joyce, added: ''We saw smoke coming from a shed and thought
the door was on fire but then this poor man came out covered in flames.
''He was obviously in a lot of pain and had his arms stretched out --
it was awful. The ceremony went on after the accident. We didn't tell
Joanne what had happened until afterwards.
''We told her that someone had collapsed outside the church.''
The Rev Pat Bealing said: ''We were all terribly shocked by what
happened.''
Another guest was treated in hospital for shock following the
incident.
Paramedics took Mr Handy, of Dacre Street, South Shields, to the
town's general hospital and he was later taken to Newcastle General,
where he died in the intensive care unit while his sister, Eunice, was
at his bedside.
A Northumbria police spokesman said last night: ''This appears to have
been a terrible tragedy.
''Mr Handy was spotted shortly before the fire carrying a red petrol
can -- we can only assume he got some of the fuel on his body and it
ignited when he switched on the light.''

<HEADLINE>The night two secret drinkers led to unfair sacking of Gleneagles barman</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977584359</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE potted palms were swaying at the Gleneagles Hotel after two
private detectives poured drinks over them, an industrial tribunal has
heard in relation to a claim for unfair dismissal.
The men, undercover Pinkerton agents, surreptitiously poured #63.60
worth of drinks into the plants in the cocktail lounge while carrying
out a routine security audit at the five-star hotel in Auchterarder,
Perthshire, on January 23, 1995.
At around 8pm, they went into the American Bar to buy drinks with
''marked'' money, which showed up under ultraviolet light, and for an
hour observed Mr Lyndon Bowring and Miss Nicola Stewart, the two duty
cocktail bartenders.
Mr Bowring, of Clos Nant-y-Cym, North Penwtyn, Cardiff, who claimed he
was unfairly dismissed by the hotel, said the private detectives had
bought two rounds but the Pinkerton pair claimed to have bought six.
The morning after the night in the American Bar the detectives
reported to Mr McKenzie, the security manager, that they had spent
#63.60, which could not be reconciled with the till report.
Two days later the barman was summoned to a meeting in front of Mr K
Poulter, former deputy general manager, and Mr B Graham, former acting
personnel manager, at which he denied knowledge of the irregularities.
The tribunal notes: ''He stated he could remember only two rounds of
drink being served to the Pinkerton agents. He confirmed he had banked
cash takings when the bar closed and that these amounted to #22.60.''
At the end the barman, who was suspended on full pay, was ''visibly
distressed by the nature of the meeting''. A search of his quarters
revealed nothing.
A disciplinary hearing followed on January 27 but despite requests by
Mr Bowring, Mr Poulter refused to give him any documentation, including
the Pinkerton report.
The hearing sacked the barman and he lost an appeal on February 23.
Before the appeal, Mr G Graham, the hotel's operations director, carried
out some investigations of his own.
He noted Mr Bowring's claim that the undercover agents had only bought
two rounds of drinks, none of which he had taken to their table.
Mr Graham also noted the surveillance report, which ''indicated that
the Pinkerton agents had disposed of the six rounds of drinks they had
purchased by surreptitiously pouring them over nearby plants in the
American Bar''.
The operations manager visited the bar to check whether this was
feasible and also spoke to the hotel gardeners about the matter.
In issuing its judgment the tribunal unanimously decided the
Gleneagles Hotel plc had not adopted a fair procedure in dismissing the
applicant by not issuing him with a copy of the Pinkerton report, and
awarded Mr Bowring #2114 compensation.
But because of contributory conduct the tribunal halved the award and
noted: ''He had by his own admission during the investigative process
been unable to account for the sum of #10.60.
''As that sum represented one round of drinks purchased by the
Pinkerton agents it would have been reasonable to expect the respondents
to have investigated whether responsibility for misappropriation of that
sum lay with the applicant and Miss Stewart jointly, or with one of them
alone.
''In all the circumstances it seems just and equitable to reduce the
applicant's compensation by 50% by reason of contributory conduct.''

TENS of thousands of bees swarmed into Mr Keith Dodson's house in
Stornoway. But, despite calls to police and the Western Isles Council,
Mr Dodson, a sports centre officer, says that no-one would help and his
panic-stricken family.
For almost a week, Mr Dodson, his wife, Catherine, and daughters,
Sandra, 19, and Caroline, 17, have fought to clear their private house
at Mackenzie Street of the bees, which were covered in soot and made
three rooms filthy in minutes. Life is only now getting back to normal
after they used sulphur candles to fumigate the rooms.
The Dodsons had closed off the three affected rooms and called police
and the environmental health department. Mr Dodson said: ''The
department didn't even come and see. They did nothing. The depute
environmental health director, Mr Bryan Barrett, suggested a pest
control company.'' The Dodsons said that only Councillor Katie Mackenzie
came to see the bees for herself.
Mr Dodson rang the council chief executive, Mr Brian Stewart. ''When
the chief executive heard it was not a council house, he said there was
nothing they could do.''
Mr Barrett confirmed that he referred Mr Dodson to a private company.
He said: ''He did not get back to me, so I had no idea he still had the
problem. If he had, I would have done something about it. It's not a
statutory duty of the council to do something about bees. We have
neither the training nor the equipment.''
Local councillor Al Macrae promised to have a close look at the
problem of bees as dangerous pests.

The House of Lords will this
week discuss allegations of bullying at one of Scotland's most famous
independent schools, Fettes College in Edinburgh, whose old boys include
Labour leader Tony Blair.
At its annual founder's day ceremony at the weekend the school's
headmaster, Mr Malcolm Thyne, strongly denied claims of bullying and
sexual assault on pupils.
He told an audience of about 1500 people that he thought the
allegations were the result of a campaign to cause embarrassment to the
school, where fees cost #10,000 a year.
He said: ''The issue, I think, has arisen following my decision in
1992 to ask six members of the school to leave following an incident
involving cannabis. Since that time there has been a sustained campaign
to cause embarrassment to the school.''
Mr Thyne said he was very proud of the school, his staff who served
it, and the current pupils, adding that he believed parents were
delighted with the quality of education being provided.
The Lords will be discussing an amendment to the Children (Scotland)
Bill, which could result in independent schools receiving annual
inspections instead of one every five years, as proposed by the
Government.
Submissions on the allegations have been sent by parents and former
pupils to the Earl of Mar and Kellie and other peers, and the matter
will be discussed on Wednesday in the House.
Fettes has not been inspected sinced 1981, but a spokesman for the 475
pupil co-educational school said yesterday it would be ''quite happy''
to have annual inspections as it regarded the 14-year gap as too long.
Around a marquee set up in the grounds of the 125-year-old college for
the founder's day ceremony parents were dismissive of the allegations.
Landowner Eileen Monk, from Aberdeen, whose son was at the school for 10
years, said: ''It is a load of codswallop.''
Yesterday, the Earl of Mar and Kellie was unavailable for comment.

A FILM starring Omar Sharif and Glenda Jackson was abandoned after a
swindle by two businessmen.
Lawyer Euan McIlvride, 35, and Michael McLetchie, 39, were convicted
at the High Court in Glasgow at the weekend of defrauding the film's
producer.
They had pretended they could raise #12m to fund a historical film
called The Castle.
The producer, Kenteas Brine, 45, spent nearly #lm building a village
in Czechoslovakia as a set. She told Mr Scott Brady, prosecuting, that
she had to sell her home when cash ran out for the project, and the two
accused pretended they could fund the money she needed.
Miss Brine told how, in 1990, she borrowed $35,000 from the late Sir
John Anthony Langford-Holt, a former Tory MP and Lloyd's name, and gave
it to the accused. Both were directors of RTR Estates Ltd, of West Nile
Street, Glasgow, which dealt in raising finance for businesses.
But McIlvride and McLetchie failed to produce the money they promised.
The jury returned its verdict on Saturday after spending the night in
a hotel at the end of a five-week trial.
McIlvride, of Stewart Drive, Glasgow, and McLetchie, of Islay Drive,
Newton Mearns, were found guilty of defrauding Miss Brine of $35,000.
McIlvride was also found guilty of embezzling #3450 while a lawyer
with another firm seven years ago.
He was also found guilty of embezzling #13,244 in a swindle involving
a fishing boat skipper. McIlvride gave the skipper #37,000, less #2000
in fees, and sold a licence for #50,000 to a firm in Buckie, the court
heard.
The jury found fraud charges against both accused not proven in two
other cases involving a total of #15,000.
Temporary judge Alexander Wilkinson deferred sentence for three weeks
for background reports, and continued bail.

THE Employment Secretary became involved with the ''wets'' yesterday
when he turned out to support his department at a rained-off cricket
match.
Mr Michael Portillo, despite heavy showers and a battery of TV
cameras, joined an Employment Department team due to play against
industrial and labour newspaper correspondents.
However, he ended up sheltering with his wife, Carolyn, beneath a huge
umbrella at Mill Hill School, north London, close to his Enfield
constituency.
''Why is it always raining in Mill Hill?'' he asked.
Employment Department officials said Mr Portillo was not sporty and he
was not due to play in the match.
Mr Portillo stayed for an hour, chatting with officials from his
department, and sipping a glass of diet cola.
Half an hour after he left, the sun came out, and the match started.
But it was abandoned after less than an hour when heavy rain returned.

IN THE latest episode of the Grant-Hurley saga, the brunette
girlfriend disguised in a blonde wig took refuge in a castle, having won
the support of Estee Lauder, and the boyfriend's fantasy was
''revealed''.
The president of the cosmetic giant, Mr Leonard Lauder, said in a
statement: ''Elizabeth Hurley's contract with Estee Lauder remains
unchanged.'' It is reported to be worth #1m.
0 However, the future of the couple looked less settled. Lord
Brocklehurst said: ''She has made no decision about the future of her
relationship.'' Miss Hurley had fled at the weekend to Lord
Brocklehurst's family home, Sudeley Castle.
The 550-year-old castle at Winchcombe in Gloucestershire is open to
the public and attracts thousands every year.
Coachloads of visitors were shown round the castle, crammed with
historical treasures and once the palace of Katherine Parr, who is
buried in the castle church.
Reporters and photographers hoping to catch sight of Miss Hurley were
given their marching orders by a member of staff as soon as they veered
off the tourist trail.
However, a blonde wig fooled no one when she emerged from the castle
for a drive with Lord Brocklehurst.
Grant, meanwhile, could relive the opening episode where he was
charged with lewd conduct in public. In the News of the World, Divine
Brown said Grant paid her #40 for sex in his BMW convertible. She said
the actor told her: ''I always wanted to sleep with a black woman.
That's my fantasy.''

THE differences over Europe emerged again yesterday as the crucial
issue between Tory leadership contenders John Major and John Redwood.
Mr Major stuck to his guns over his policy on Europe, refusing to rule
out a single currency or come down in favour of a referendum: Mr Redwood
made clear that no Government led by him would ever agree to the
abolition of the pound.
In his stance, Mr Major also warned of the dangers of appealing to the
hard-right Euro view. ''There is no point in the Conservative Party
enthusing 20% of the electorate if the other 80% is not prepared to
understand its policies.''
Mr Redwood, on his determination to avoid scandal by using a moral
screening programme of potential Ministers, said there would no problem
in appointing a homosexual if they were quite open about it.
Both men will try to sell their message to the right-wing 92 Group of
Tory MPs at Westminster today, in what could be a last attempt to win
support. Opinion poll evidence at the weekend indicated Mr Major will
win tomorrow, but a question mark exists over whether he can win by
enough to make him safe.
A survey of Tory MPs in the Sunday Express found Mr Major would get
about 224 votes compared with 60 for Mr Redwood and 45 abstentions. The
Sunday Times found the Prime Minister's rating among people who voted
Tory in 1992 had risen seven points to 55% since last week, compared
with Mr Redwood on 10%. A poll by the BBC's political research unit
showed some 93% of 150 constituency chairmen who replied to the survey
favoured the Prime Minister.
However, if many more than 100 MPs fail to support him, either through
voting for Mr Redwood or abstentions, the feeling is that he will stand
down, opening the way for a second ballot in which the big guns such as
Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Michael Portillo would enter the fray. Some
believe their supporters may deliberately abstain on the first ballot to
force the issue.
Mr Major's only concession yesterday to the Euro-sceptics was to adopt
his traditional ''wait-and-see'' approach, holding out the possibility
of Britain setting itself up as a leader of nations excluded from the
single currency.
He said only a small number of nations would be ready to move to
monetary union in 1999 and no thought had been given to those left out.
Making clear the decision would have to be taken at the time and could
not be prejudged, he said: ''Once the decision has been made, if we do
have a two-core Europe, an inner core and an outer core, I think small
nations in the outer core will probably look to some of the bigger
nations and we might well be that nation.''
He combined his remarks on Europe with a strong call for party unity.
''The Conservative Party wins elections from the centre-right, and that
is where I stand. There is no point in the Conservative Party enthusing
20% of the electorate if the other 80% is not prepared to understand its
policies. We need to win 40% or 45% of the vote -- closer to 45% than
40% -- in order to form the next government.''
Mr Redwood claimed his message was gaining ground, particularly in the
constituencies.
''I am saying there have to be changes for us to win the election. I
have put forward policy changes, I am also putting myself forward to
take those policy changes through and to lead the party to the future.
We have found as the week has progressed a growing amount of support
coming in from around the country for what I am saying and that is
beginning to have an impact on MPs.''
On the aspect of scandal and sleaze, he told ITV's Jonathan Dimbleby
programme: ''Anybody being offered a job for the first time in a
government under my leadership would talk to me or a senior colleague
about the intrusiveness of the modern media.''
On homosexuality, Mr Redwood said: ''We would have to discuss whether
or nor that was going to be an embarrassment to them. If someone was a
homosexual, but said so, and that was on the public record, I'd see no
problem with that at all.''
One of Mr Major's campaign leaders, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang,
appeared to concede that a ''technical'' victory tomorrow would not be
enough for Mr Major, though he believed the question was academic since
the mood was shifting ''firmly and decisively towards a very substantial
victory''.
Former Tory party chairman Lord Tebbit, a declared supporter of Mr
Redwood, said Europe remained the key issue. ''I hoped that when John
Major took this decision to precipitate this election and stand down as
leader that he would take up the Euro-sceptic flag and carry it. He did
not do so,'' he told BBC Radio.
Laour, meanwhile, held out the prospect of a ''no confidence'' vote on
the Government in the Commons. Deputy leader John Prescott said: ''If it
goes to a second ballot then the question of whether this party can
govern the country is a very clear issue and we will have to judge it
there and then.''

RAIL travellers could face an other summer of disruption if a train
drivers' ballot result out today backs strike action.
Officials of Aslef (the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and
Firemen) believe the 12,000 British Rail drivers, including about 1500
in Scotland, will come out in support of a series of 24-hour strikes in
protest at what the union has described as a ''derisory'' 3% pay offer
which BR says is final.
The executive of Aslef will meet today to consider the ballot result,
but was not officially predicting the outcome because voting does not
end until noon today. However union sources yesterday forecast a
''significant majority'' in favour of strike action.
One Scottish union official said such backing would mean all rail
services, including freight and InterCity trains, would grind to a halt
on strike days and warned that disruption would be much more widespread
than during last year's signalworkers' dispute since BR would not be
able to replace train drivers as easily as signalworkers were replaced.
ScotRail admitted yesterday that it was bracing itself for widespread
disruption and warned that a further loss of revenue on top of the
signalworkers' dispute could lead to job losses.
Aslef, which has to give BR seven-days' notice of strikes, could start
the first walk-out from next Monday, while Rail, Maritime, and Transport
union members at BR and on London Underground are also voting on one-day
strikes over pay, with the result expected on Friday.
Mr Pat O'Connor, Aslef district secretary for Scotland, said yesterday
that he was ''100% confident'' that the union would be given a mandate
to start industrial action, adding that its executive would meet
immediately afterwards and would probably decide to hold one 24-hour
stoppage each week.
''Depending on the time of day the strike action started, that could
mean a complete shutdown of all services in Scotland and the rest of
Britain for a minimum of 24 hours.''
He said the dispute was solely about the ''derisory'' 3% pay increase
offered by management, which would be the fourth consecutive pay rise of
less than the rate of inflation.
Train drivers currently earn a gross pay rate of #220 per week, and
can earn about an extra #30 in ancilliary payments for overtime and
variations in conditions such as driver-only operations.
Describing the train drivers' wage rate as ''unbelievable'' given the
responsibilty of their jobs, Mr O'Connor said that rail privatisation
meant it was vitally important ''to establish a reasonable wage before
we go into company-bargaining when they will be looking for all sorts of
changes in conditions such as an increase in hours and shifts.''
He added: ''We hope the public realise that the last thing Aslef
members want is to cause them any inconvenience.''
BR is expected to declare a healthy profit for the last financial year
when its annual report is published on tomorrow.
RMT's general secretary, Mr Jimmy Knapp, said: ''The expected profit
justifies the arguments we made during the pay negotiations that BR can
afford more, and that the workforce deserve a better offer than 3%.''
A ScotRail spokeswoman said yesterday that, although every effort
would be made to maintain as many services as possible, the implications
of a train drivers' strike would be very serious.
''The majority of train crews are Aslef or RMT members so any strike
action would mean there would be very limited services.
''The implications in terms of loss of customers and income just don't
bear thinking about. There was a small percentage of people who did not
return to railway services last time.
''UK-wide, from the strikes in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
railways lost between 1% and 3% of passengers who just didn't come back
after finding alternative means of transport to rail.''
She further warned: ''In the long-term, if the railway loses more
money because of strike action it has to cut costs. ScotRail's major
cost is its staff -- the only asset -- so if cuts in budget have to be
made, one area it would have to look at would be staff.''
She said it was difficult to say if strikes would affect the viability
of services but admitted that, if the railway loses a lot of money as a
result of industrial action, the Office of Passenger and Rail
Franchising (whose Passenger Service Requirement document is presently
out for public consultation and will be finalised later this year)
''might say that some things have to be withdrawn''.
Aslef later dismissed such warnings as ''scare tactics.''
* Meanwhile the white-collar Transport Salaried Staffs' Association
yesterday accused BR of trying to ''torpedo'' efforts to resolve its pay
dispute by mediation.
The union, which has 23,000 members at BR, wanted to refer its pay
claim to mediation rather than hold a ballot for industrial action, but
BR would not agree.
The union's general secretary, Mr Richard Rosser, accused the
Government of ''meddling'' in the negotiations. But a BR spokesman said:
''With our two main unions engaged in balloting it would be
inappropriate to become involved in mediation at this time.''

FIVE members of staff at Perth Prison, including a senior assistant
governor and a supervisor, have been suspended from duty.
The Scottish Prison Service said three officers and a supervisor have
been suspended pending the outcome of inquiries by Tayside police and
prison governors ''following allegations made by a number of
prisoners''.
The SPS said it could not reveal the nature of the inquiries but it is
understood they are based on allegations of assault.
A spokesman for the SPS said the four, whose names have not been
revealed, were put on special leave on Thursday. It is technically not a
suspension but has the same effect.
A spokesman for Tayside police in Perth said: ''We can confirm that
there is a police investigation in progress regarding allegations
against three officers and a supervisor at Perth Prison.''
A senior official, whose position was described as a middle-ranking
governor, has also been suspended on full pay following an internal SPS
inquiry and a disciplinary hearing last Wednesday.
It is understood the matter is related to expenses claims and that the
person involved admitted alleged irregularities.
After the hearing, prison Governor Mike Duffy recommended on Friday
that the person concerned, who has also not been named, should be
dismissed from the SPS. However, the decision is subject to the
ratification of the Secretary of State for Scotland and the person has
the right to appeal against the finding.
Perth Prison, Scotland's oldest, houses more than 400, including a
mixture of short and long-term inmates and local remand prisoners.
The prison population also includes about half of the country's 12
category A inmates who are regarded as those prisoners who pose the
greatest danger to the public and prison staff and require the highest
security.
Perth was the scene of riots by about 120 inmates in December 1992,
when prison officers were taken hostage in D hall. There were previous
riots in 1987.

IRISH whiskey is to be blended and bottled in Scotland, then sold to
retail chains in Britain. The arrangement is part of a 10-year deal
between Invergordon Distilleries in Glasgow and Ireland's only
independent whiskey maker, the tiny Cooley Distillery.
Cooley will provide the bulk whiskey which Invergordon will blend and
bottle for sale to 10 leading British chains, including Tesco and Asda,
as an own-brand product. Another brand, Erin's Isle, will be sold
through smaller retailers who do not want an own label.
According to Cooley's chief executive, Dr John Teeling, the deal
follows an approach by Invergordon. ''They were apparently very
impressed by the success of a Cooley single-malt whiskey which is being
sold by the Sainsbury's chain as an own-brand product,'' he said.
Irish whiskey sells at around #13 a bottle in the UK. The new brands
will be some #2 cheaper. But Dr Teeling expects prices to fall further
as Irish Distillers, the dominant Irish whiskey maker, reacts to this
latest move.
Invergordon is part of American Brands, which also owns Whyte &amp; Mackay
which last week dispensed with the services of the chairman and chief
executive, Mr Michael Lunn.
Meanwhile, the first whisky to be produced on Arran in 150 years was
yesterday run from the copper stills of the island's new distillery at
Lochranza. Isle of Arran Distillers are producing an eight-year-old
single malt, which ''is robust with a nice sweetness and a nutty,
peppery flavour''.
It was in middle of last century that the last legal whisky was made
on the island, at Lagg.
The company has also launched the Arran Bond, a scheme for
pre-purchasing the distillery's early production, and is building a
visitor centre which it hopes to open next summer.
