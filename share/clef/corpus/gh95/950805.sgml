LIFE-LONG Hearts supporter Jim Jefferies took over as manager at
Tynecastle yesterday -- and admitted that the club he used to enjoy
beating most of all was the one whose fortunes he has been asked to turn
around.
Grinned Jefferies: ''Honestly, when I was manager of a team playing
against Hearts, I always wanted to win the games, and really do well
against them. Maybe it was because I wanted to impress the people here,
because this was the job I always wanted. I can't hide that.
''My father is a Hearts supporter, I used to stand on the terracings
and travel everywhere to watch them, and my own son is a Jambo, too. It
is in the blood.
''Obviously, it is the job I dreamed of having at some stage in my
career and now here I am.
''But I don't want the fans thinking that I am arriving here as some
kind of Messiah. That is not the case. What is needed is hard work from
everyone.
''When I was a player at the club I gave 100%. I don't think that
anyone could accuse me of doing anything other than that in all the
years I was with Hearts. That is what I want from the lads who are here
now.''
Jefferies made it clear that he would not accept less from the players
he has inherited. He insisted: ''I may have some hard decisions to make
when I get into this job. I will tell you this: I won't shirk doing
that. If there are tough decisions to be made for the good of this club,
then these will be made.
''In other jobs I have had, I have never sidestepped a hard decision
and I won't do it now. People talk about the great team spirit we had at
Falkirk and I like to think that did help us do well last season. But
when Alex MacDonald and Sandy Jardine were in charge here they had a
similar feeling among the players. You always felt that everyone in that
team was pulling for each other. We have to get back to that.''
Jefferies will work under the same severe financial constraints as his
predecessor, Tommy McLean, but he hinted strongly that some money might
become available and that he would be ready to wheel and deal in the
transfer market to get the team he wants.
''I don't know how long it will take,'' he says, ''but I do want to
deliver a trophy for this club and for their fans. They have had so many
disappointments in finals, and in semi-finals, and in the league, when
they seemed to have won the title. I told the chairman I want to get
that monkey off their backs.''
Jefferies will watch the team in action at Derby today, but will not
take charge formally until next week. Then he hopes to be joined by his
assistant at Falkirk, Billy Brown. The Brockville club have given Hearts
permission to speak to Brown, provided a compensation figure can be
agreed. The Edinburgh side claim that will be done in time for the
midweek clash with Newcastle.

CELTIC may not have been issued with their safety certificate for the
new-look Parkhead yesterday (they hope to secure it this morning), but
they did receive clearance from the German FA which will allow Andreas
Thom to make his debut against Newcastle United.
The news was welcomed by manager Tommy Burns and by his record signing
from Germany last night as they prepared for Celtic's most serious test
of their pre-season programme so far.
Burns pointed out: ''Newcastle have spent a great deal of money in the
summer, which underlines just how ambitious they are. They are a club
who are aiming for the Premiership title in England.
''We have built towards this game, using the matches we have had so
far to get things right. There were positive signs at Goodison, where we
drew with Everton, and we are looking for further improvement.''
Thom seems determined to make his first appearance before the Celtic
fans a memorable one. The 29-year-old internationalist, who spent five
years with Bayer Leverkusen after leaving the former East Germany, wants
to impress the Parkhead support.
''Everyone has told me that these supporters are simply the best,'' he
says. ''It would be very good for me if I could do well in my very first
game. It will not be easy against Newcastle, but then we have to aim to
match that quality of opposition.
''There will be a little bit of pressure on me. That is natural when
you come to a new club, but I am sure the fans will help me forget any
nervousness.''
Thom, in common with Burns, is certain that he can strike up a
profitable partnership with Pierre van Hooydonk. This afternoon, all
going well with the safety inspection, the Celtic support will get an
indication for themselves if that is going to happen in the new season.
Frenchman David Ginola will play for the English side after snubbing
Celtic's signing offer, but Burns said yesterday that there were no hard
feelings over that deal which went sour.
Whether the Celic support will see things in that same diplomatic way
is another matter.
* MOTHERWELL must subue the new wonder boy of Finnish football if they
are to clear their preliminary round in the UEFA Cup next week.
Manager Alex McLeish returned yesterday from a spying trip on MyPa 47
and immediately named Jonas Kolkka as the main threat to his European
hopes.
After watching MyPa 47 beat Kuusys Lahti 3-1, he revealed: ''The Finns
have produced several top-class players like Jari Litmannen in recent
years. This little lad Kolkka is a bit special. We must keep him quiet
or suffer the consequences.
''MyPa played to a higher standard than I expected. They won the game
very comfortably and showed a lot of quality. They always looked
dangerous.
''It certainly will not be an easy night at Fir Park, where we must
establish a lead without giving anything away.''
MyPa are an emerging power in Finnish football and are in Europe for
the third successive season. Their policy has been to buy the best young
players in their country -- and this has paid off with the sale of
Litmannen to Ajax and Marco Rajamaki to Morton.
* BLACKBURN striker Alan Shearer has been given the all-clear after
returning early from the champions' pre-season tour of Scandinavia with
a back injury.
He may not play in today's friendly against Huddersfield, but will
certainly be fit for Tuesday's game at Kilmarnock.

THE row between Hearts and Falkirk did not end yesterday when Jim
Jefferies was handed a five-year contract to take over as manager of the
Tynecastle club.
Indeed, by last night it appeared to have intensified after Chris
Robinson, chairman of the Edinburgh side, had indicated that he was
ready to pay compensation to Falkirk -- ''today, tomorrow, or the next
day.''
But Brockville chairman George Fulston snapped angrily: ''I cannot
understand why Chris Robinson is telling people that at a press
conference. He has made a verbal offer so far, one which in no way comes
close to meeting our ideas on compensation.
''He knows how I feel about that, yet he has never been in touch again
and he makes these announcements when it was made very clear to him that
he could not appoint Jim Jefferies until he had agreed a compensation
figure with Falkirk Football Club. That was in our initial letter to
Hearts, when they asked for permission to approach our manager. They
have chosen to ignore that and we shall be raising the matter with the
football authorities.''
I understand that Hearts have offered just #30,000, roughly half the
annual earnings Jefferies had at Falkirk. He had another year of his
contract to run and, of course, Fulston offered him a seven-year deal
when he decided to remain, only for Jefferies to change his mind again
24 hours later.
Fulston realises that he could stop Jefferies taking up his new post
if he resorted to the law, but he won't do that. Fulston will play the
game according to football's rules and will allow the Scottish League
and the SFA to judge the situation.
Robinson is ready to do the same and has already written to both the
League and the SFA to alert them to the possible need for a tribunal to
be set up to decide the level of compensation.
Yesterday Robinson denied that the whole affair resembled the
Celtic-Tommy Burns-Kilmarnock fiasco of last season.
But Fulston claimed: ''I know how Bob Fleeting felt last year. We have
lost a manager and we have not been treated fairly over this. We will be
in touch with the football authorities and place the whole situation
before them. Unless Hearts can offer a sensible figure in compensation,
then a tribunal will be necessary to sort the whole thing out.
''Meanwhile, we have to start looking for another manager when we
thought we could look forward to a period of stability. It is difficult
to accept what has happened.''
Fulston, of course, knows that he must get on with the job he has
begun at Falkirk and rely on the football hierarchy to solve a
compensation problem which has not been of his making.

RUGBY
KERRY Packer's plans for a rebel World Rugby Corporation seemed to be
crumbling last night as leading South African players rejected his
overtures and the top Australians look poised to follow suit.
The South African Rugby Football Union said the 28-strong World
Cup-winning Springbok squad had agreed to sign contracts with them.
''I met with the players this morning and they have agreed to remain
loyal to SARFU and will not take part in any other organisation.
Contractual details are being finalised,'' Edward Griffiths, SARFU's
chief executive, told a news conference at Ellis Park.
State television later stated that 25 of the 28 had signed contracts,
claiming that only utility back Hennie le Roux, centre Christiaan
Scholtz, and flanker Robby Brink had asked for more time.
''I do not believe there's a single member of the World Cup squad
bound to the World Rugby Corporation,'' Griffiths said. He added that
South African players outside the national squad could also look forward
to lucrative contracts from their provincial unions following a meeting
on Thursday.
Asked if the deal meant that South African rugby was now fully
professional, Griffiths said: ''It doesn't mean that. Until the
International Rugby Football Board meeting in August, rugby union
remains an amateur game.''
Earlier, Australian Rugby Football Union board member Ian Ferrier said
in Sydney that the top Australian players would remain loyal and reject
offers to defect to Packer's WRC. Ferrier said in Sydney: ''Can you
imagine a world contest without Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa?
It would be a joke.''
New Zealand players, who are currently in negotiations with their
governing body, seem sure to take note of yesterday's developments.
In June, the Australian, New Zealand, and South African rugby unions
signed a 10-year television rights deal with the News Corporation outfit
of Packer's rival, Rupert Murdoch. The #360m deal has enabled officials
to offer players the lucrative contracts which appear to have won the
day in Johannesburg and Sydney.
In the northern hemisphere, England's players, who are not involved in
the Murdoch deal, have turned down a #30,000-a-man offer from the
English RFU, whose secretary, Tony Hallett, is expected to prepare a
peace package when he returns from holiday this weekend.

THE British women's eight, including George Watson's College girls
Katrina Hastings, Isabel Walker, and Louise Fitzgibbon, just failed to
qualify for today's main final at the world junior championships in
Posnan, Poland, coming third in their race yesterday behind Romania and
the Czech Republic.
Ironically, if they had been drawn in the other repechage, their time
would have been good enough to put them into the final.
The British team of 10 boats has now managed to gain five main final
places, including the women's four which has both Hastings and Walker
aboard.
Although not in this crew, Fitzgibbon has played her part in putting
her club-mates into the biggest race of their careers.
She substituted for Walker earlier in the week when the regatta's
salmonella outbreak was at its height.
The other British crews racing for medals today will be the women's
pair, both the men's pairs -- coxed and coxless, and the men's coxless
four.

FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
STOCKPORT County have upset Cowdenbeath chairman Gordon McDougall, who
claims that the English club also has demeaned Scottish football. The
problem is that the Central Park side's top striker, Mark Yardley, has
been on trial with Stockport, but they have now offered only #l0,000 for
his transfer.
''They have told us and the player that this is their top offer,''
said McDougall. ''But they know that it is not enough, for they will not
go to a transfer tribunal.
''Now we are left with an unhappy player, who is so upset that we will
have to leave him out of our opening match against Albion Rovers in the
Coca-Cola Cup today.
''This offer is demeaning to Scottish football. It is treating the
third division like an amateur division. To take the player down there
and put in an offer like this is a disgrace.''
Cowdenbeath also will be without Sammy Conn, whose son has been
injured in a road accident, when they visit Cliftonhill.
Queen of the South wish to sign Dragutin Ristic, the former Dundee
United player. Palmerston manager Billy McLaren said: ''We are in
contact with him in Yugoslavia and he is considering our offer.''
Meanwhile, Queen's will include recent signings Jim Butter, Stuart
Wilson, and Colin Harris today against Queen's Park.
Clyde yesterday signed former Hearts midfielder Tommy Harrison and the
former Meadowbank keeper Jim McQueen, who will be included in their
squad for the match against East Stirling, who will be without out of
contract midfield player Ian Lee.
Alloa will have Steve Morrison in against Forfar, while Steve Paterson
will be in charge of Caledonian Thistle for the first time as they visit
Berwick.
Jim Leishman's Livingston -- formerly Meadowbank -- visit Montrose and
Arbroath will include many new signings for their visit to Ross County.
Finally, East Fife must travel to Brechin.
* IT is a sad day when the only team who wants to sign a former
Scottish internationalist is that of his local pub, but such is the case
with David Speedie.
The former World Cup player put himself on the Endsleigh League's list
of available players after having been cleared of injury. But after
months of training to regain fitness, no club has shown any interest in
the former Liverpool, Blackburn, and Chelsea favourite.
Now the 35-year-old has resigned himself to playing for his local pub
team in Warwickshire if no-one comes forward before the season starts.
''I haven't had one phone call from any club,'' said Speedie. ''Money
isn't an issue. I don't play football for money.
''If nothing comes up I will be joining my mates at the Chetwynd Arms
-- I just want to play.''
* DUNDEE United fans are being urged to turn up at Tannadice tomorrow
to pay their tribute to Dave Bowman. The former Scotland player has his
testimonial against city rivals Dundee, and United will field several
players who miss the competitive start of the season through suspension
-- including Bowman himself.

GARY ARMSTRONG, the Scot-
land and Jed-Forest scrum half, has been given the all-clear by the
medics in his fight to win back an international place.
Armstrong was sidelined a year ago after having suffered a devastating
training injury to the left knee. The ligaments in the joint were so
badly damaged that carbon-fibre material had to be used to restore
strength to the knee.
The 28-year-old lorry driver revealed recently that he was determined
to win back his place in the Scottish side.
This week specialists at an Edinburgh hospital carried out a final
inspection on the injury and pronounced the Jed man ready to take
contact on the damaged joint.
''I've been training with the club for the past month or so and last
week I did a charity tri-athlon in the Borders, so my general fitness is
fine,'' said Armstrong.
''Last night at training I got my brother, Kevin, to put in a dozen or
more tackles on me and it all went well. I'm well on target now to play
for Jed at the start of the season.''
The knee injury meant that Armstrong missed the Five Nations' campaign
this year and also cost him his place in Scotland's World Cup squad.
''I've made up my mind that I want to have another one or two seasons
at the top,'' he said. ''Since I've been away I've come to realise how
much I miss international rugby. I'm keen to go to New Zealand with
Scotland next summer because the last time I was there in 1990, it
underlined just how superb the rugby is over there.''
He added: ''I know that getting my place back in the Scottish side is
going to be hard. Bryan Redpath is the sitting tenant and he's playing
really well.''

CRICKET ROUND-UP
GRAEME Hick's Test career is at a crossroads -- and he can only hope
that his omission from Old Trafford represented a give-way signal rather
than a stop sign.
West Indies batsman Jimmy Adams, however, looks like missing the
remainder of the series after having suffering a cracked cheekbone.
While his colleagues prepare to face England in the crucial fifth Test
at Trent Bridge, Adams will undergo surgery from a Nottingham
specialist.
Hick was bitterly disappointed to be discarded from a Manchester match
that ended in a series-levelling victory for Mike Atherton's new-look
team. But he will feel even worse tomorrow if his name is missing from
England's squad.
Having been taken to Old Trafford and then omitted when 13 players
were whittled down to 11, Hick might think he's the obvious batsman to
benefit from Robin Smith's unfortunate facial injury -- especially as
Alec Stewart remains out of contention because of a broken finger.
But his return looks far from automatic, with Alan Wells and David
Byas certain to be considered as alternatives at tonight's selection
meeting. And there is even a possibility that Allan Lamb -- dropped
nearly three years ago -- could come into the reckoning.
With Nick Knight (1 cap) and John Crawley (7 caps) certain to be
picked, there is a lack of experience among England's top-order now that
Smith's services have been cruelly taken away. Lamb, in good form this
season,would solve that problem even more emphatically than Hick.
But his name has never been mentioned since he made ball-tampering
allegations against Pakistan in 1992. If there is a Northants player in
this weekend's squad it is more likely to be David Capel. Now 32,
all-rounder Capel has suddenly found the form of his life -- five years
after he last played a Test for England. Averaging 36 with the bat and
having taken 38 championship wickets, Capel looks a better bet than
Craig White, whose contribution to the Old Trafford victory was modest.
Adams, meanwhile, was resting at the team hotel yesterday after having
been discharged from hospital. He will not be sent home and the West
Indies have not yet written him off for the remainder of the tour,
although further participation looks unlikely.

KEN Wood opened the defence of his men's singles title at the Bank of
Scotland Scottish hardcourt championships at Dundee's Games Club
yesterday with a clinical victory over surprise quarter-finalist Gary
Smith.
The Dunfermline player never looked back after he dropped the first
game and reeled off the next 12 to secure his win but was suitably
impressed by the 15-year-old from Clarkston, who had claimed the scalps
of ranked seniors Toby Smith and Ronnie Terras on his way to the last
eight.
Wood said: ''It's good to see another youngster coming through but if
he's going to make an impression on the senior game he'll need to work
on his serve and learn to be more patient in the long rallies.
''I was trying to adjust to the hardcourt from grass by hitting deep
with top spin and he gave me a good workout.''
Today's semi-final stage provides a repeat of last year's decider
between Wood and Jason Barnett, who proved too strong for 16-year-old
Nick Bradley, while former British Davis Cup player Nick Fullwood meets
fourth seed Malcolm Watt in the bottom half of the draw.
Fullwood outclassed Calum McKnight, while Watt survived a
two-and-a-half hour duel in the sun with his Newlands clubmate Ian
MacAulay before winning through 4-6, 6-2, 6-0. Results:
Men singles. Quarter-finals -- N Fulwood (Derbyshire) beat C McKnight
(Newlands) 6-0, 6-2; J Barnett (Ruthrieston) beat N Bradley (Bridge of
Allan) 6-2, 6-1; K Wood (Dunfermline) beat G Smith (David Lloyd Club)
6-1, 6-0; M Watt (Newlands) beat I MacAulay (Newlands) 4-6, 6-1, 6-0.
Men's singles. 21-and-under. Semi-finals -- Barnett beat T Smith
(Giffnock) 6-1, 6-1; S Crabtree (Nottinghamshire) beat B McIver (St
Andrews) 6-3, 6-1.
Boys' singles. 18-and-under. Semi-finals -- R Hangar (Dorset) beat S
Jigajinni (Thistle) 6-3, 6-3.
Boys' singles. 14 and under. Semi-finals -- J Gray (Bearsden) beat J
McDonald (Western) 6-2, 6-0; M Hendry (Linlithgow) beat T Ogilvie

THE only constant at Tennents West Highland yachting week which
finished off Oban yesterday has been the unrelenting sunshine.
In contrast, the winds had mainly been fickle, and for the final race,
supposedly around Lismore, it did its disappearing act again only to
return after the fleet drifted on a glassy sea for more than half an
hour, from the opposite direction.
With the course shortened just before the north end of the island, the
combination of the new light following wind, of at most six knots and a
contrary three knot tide produced a remarkable finish-line spectacle.
In one minute, the race committee estimated later, around 50 boats
crossed or attempted to cross the line. Increasingly blanketed by the
spinnakers of the battalion chasing from behind, it soon became the
finish boat crew's worst nightmare in trying to calculate results for
all 173 boats.
In Class 1, Nicky Kirk in the Sigma 8 Metre Mr Pink was sharper than
his nearest opponent on the water, sister ship Mr Green, steered by Sean
Goodlet. Both Mr Pink and Chris Owen in the new Melges 24 Tunnocks
Teacake held wide to increase the angle of their approach to the finish
line, crabbing quickly across the current. Kirk overtook the stranded
Goodlet and Mr Pink was chased by Owen over the finish. On corrected
time, second place for Teacake behind Mr Pink gave them Class 1 overall.
Arthur Harvey's textbook start in Class 2 in the S&amp;S34 Vigil set the
Gourock boat up for a fourth victory from Five Star, an aggregate which
left them clear winners of that division overall. Vigil also won the
Peter Cocks Memorial Trophy for being the week's top crew. Winners of
the Tennent Caledonian Trophy for the best family crewed yacht were the
Flowers family on the visiting J35 from Ulster, Jacana.

* BRITISH skipper Mike Golding has urged his team mates to help
restore lost pride as the 24 yachts competing for the Admiral's Cup are
joined by 220 others for the gruelling Fastnet Race starting at Cowes.
Golding, skipper of the British small boat entry in the Mumm 36 class,
says the yachtsmen representing the host nation are devastated by their
performance in the seven days of racing so far.
With Golding the only member of the British team to win a race in his
class in the entire regatta, Britain are in last place -- 6.25 points
behind seventh-placed Hong Kong.
Points for the Fastnet Race, which starts tomorrow and could last up
to a week, count 4.5 times for the Admiral's Cup.

LINFORD Christie retreated to a kitchen full of dirty dishes, to be
grilled by foreign media on the eve of the defence of the 100 metres
title at the World Athletics Championships yesterday.
The British press people, with whom the Olympic champion is enjoying
an unprecedented summer of discontent, could stand the heat of his
wrath, but could not get into the tiny, packed room.
Earlier, in open forum, Christie said he could run a world record if
that was what it would take to keep the crown. ''I was born to run, born
to be a champion, and if it takes a world record to win it, I am
capable,'' he said.
The 35-year-old's European record, 9.87sec, is just .02 outside the
world best of Leroy Burrell, who failed to make the US team.
Christie rounded angrily on reporters who asked how it felt to be a
grandfather. His 16-year old son, Merrick, is father of a young
daughter.
''What has that got to do with athletics?'' he snapped. ''Let's stick
to athletics. My personal life doesn't come into it.'' He claimed the
British media want him to lose -- a preposterous notion -- and vowed:
''A lot of them are going to be very disappointed.''
He then rounded on another questioner who asked whether he would
defend the Olympic crown in Atlanta next year: ''I've already said
everything I have to say about that.
''I am so tired of repeating that I will retire. Why not? It really
does not matter, because I can't get more famous than I already am. I
have nothing to gain and everything to lose if I continue.''
The 100m opens today, but Christie says that the 200m ''has me more
excited. Because that's unknown territory for me -- more challenging,
and I look forward to challenges.'' Reverting to the short sprint, he
added: ''There will be eight good guys in the final, and nothing is a
foregone conclusion in athletics. But I am up for the challenge and I
believe I have the ammunition to win it again.''
One journalist whom Christie surely cannot resent was happy to speak.
Irina Privalova, the European 100 and 200m champion from Moscow,
having graduated in journalism, is ready to take up a writing career.
''When? As soon as I retire. In about two years. It won't be politics.
That's still too dangerous in my country. It will be sport -- that's
what I know about.''
* BRITAIN yesterday lodged a complaint over a noisy live band and
disco which has been blaring out only 60 yards from the team's sleeping
quarters in the athletes' village.
Liz McColgan, Scotland's double former Commonwealth 10,000m champion,
who tomorrow begins her attempt to regain the world title she
surrendered through injury, said: ''The music goes on until midnight.''
McColgan is rooming with Jill Hunter who also competes in the 10,000m.
But Commonwealth champion Yvonne Murray minimised loss of sleep by
delaying her arrival until last night.
The British endurance trio learned they have one less rival to worry
about following the withdrawal last night of Ireland's world
cross-country champion, Catherina McKiernan, who has a foot injury.
The team management lodged an official protest to the IAAF through the
chairman of the athletes' commission, former Cuban athlete Alberto
Juantorena, the 1976 Olympic 400 and 800m champion.
''We have done this because we believe he will know how athletes want
to prepare,'' said UK team spokesman Tony Ward. ''Several other
countries have also complained.''
The Brits also have taken exception to arrangements for athletes
heading to compete in the stadium. They are expected to walk some 350
yards, mingling with the public going to the meeting.
''Athletes are supposed to stroll up, like it was the 1896 Olympics,''
said Ward. ''If somebody famous, like Linford Christie, goes up there
he'll be mobbed by all kinds of autograph hunters. They should have a
segregated walk-way.''
Cuba, meanwhile, reacted angrily and lodged an official protest to the
International Amateur Athletic Federation over the Italian governing
body's recommendation not to ratify Ivan Pedroso's 8.96m world-record
long jump last weekend.
The Italians have drawn attention to three video films showing the
wind gauge was obstructed by a coach. Only one other athlete at the
meeting had a single jump inside the legal limit of two metres per
second.
But Juantorena, also Cuba's IAAF delegate, said: ''As the official
report was signed by the meeting judge, this means there was nothing
wrong with the jump, and there is no reason it should not be ratified.''
* CARL Lewis has almost certainly ended his championship career. He is
in the US squad only for the long jump, and as second reserve for the
relay, has made insufficient progress following a hamstring injury.
* MEL Neef, Glasgow's Europa Cup champion, has a tough first-round
400m heat. She has drawn Commonwealth champion Cathy Freeman of
Australia and a Cuban, Idalmis Bonne, who also has run inside 51
seconds. Neef is only just third-fastest in the hardest heat, with three
to qualify, and is eleventh-fastest in the field, making her hope of a
final place a very difficult one to realise.
* PRIMO Nebiolo, president of the IAAF, contrived to keep Ingvar
Carlsson, the host nation's Prime Minister, waiting for 10 minutes.
* THE exorbitantly-priced tickets are said to be sold out for all
sessions, which is comforting for the lynx. A fund supporting the
championship mascot, Europe's last big cat, threatened with extinction,
benefits from every ticket sold.
A contribution from every beer drunk in the press bar goes to a fund
to save elephants. If the pachyderms become extinct, that is one thing
Christie won't lay at the door of the UK media. So far, we must have
been the salvation of several herds already.

ONE of the more revealing lessons I've learned from years of innocent
snooping around Scotland's corporate undergrowth is that, no matter how
simple a product or service may look to the casual outside observer, the
hidden complexities which confront companies making or providing these
everyday items can be awesome.
The other week I visited a company which makes the grown-up, real-life
version of the transfers all of us, with sons, have fiddled with and
wrestled to anchor on to Power Rangers, Transformers and other assorted
plastic model toys, from Second World War fighter planes to pirate
brigs. Family-owned Anotek of Kilwinning reinforces the truth of that
corporate lesson about apparent simplicity often masking challenging
complexity.
Anotek has a sound basic business, which succeeds in satisfying the
increasingly sophisticated demands of its customers by embracing the
newer, more exotic materials and technologies of its trade and investing
in them. That business is thriving. But, over the past three years,
Anotek also found itself on the wrong end of an internal political
battle within one of the world's biggest car makers, a battle which left
the small Ayrshire supplier bruised, out-of-pocket, but wiser in the
hard ball ways of the corporate world.
The insider's term for the transfers Anotek makes is decals. Decal,
Anotek's founder and managing director Donald Dalgoutte told me, is
short for decalcomania, the art of putting printed material onto
objects, like china. But Anotek is not in the business of putting the
patterns on Minton or Coalport tea services.
Dalgoutte started life as a screenprinter with the old Scottish
Aviation at Prestwick. And an important part of Anotek's business today
is still making the decals -- the roundels, warning notices,
identification codes, and fuel and battery port identifiers -- which go
onto the skin of real-life aircraft, not just plastic replicas. It also
makes the cockpit fascia panels which identify all the instrumentation.
You'll find Anotek's handiwork on everything from the Jetstream to the
Tornado, the Airbus to Concorde.
Such self-adhesive printed plastic products have to be durable, so a
lot of technical effort goes into both the base material which carries
the print and the adhesive which keeps it in place. On aircraft, the aim
is a seven-year life. But, of course, the technology has applications in
many other areas, including consumer electronics and the white goods
industry.
Today, Anotek's biggest single customer is Polaroid, not just the US
multinational's Vale of Leven plant, but factories in Russia, China,
Africa, and India as well. The Kilwinning plant produces all the plastic
overlays which identify each camera as a Polaroid, an astonishing eight
to ten million components each year.
''Since it's a camera, we can't afford to allow any flecks of dust to
become attached. And the decals mustn't cause any light refraction,''
explains Donald Dalgoutte. ''It's probably the best tooling
specification of its kind in the world. It may seem like a ridiculous
spec for plastic technology. But we're can deliver it.''
Anotek's customer list also ranges to other household names like
Mitsubishi, JVC, Philips, Hoover, and Vodaphone. ''It's taken us a long
time to put together a customer list like that'' says Donald's son
Callum, the operations manager. Donald's wife Margaret, another son, a
daughter, a son-in-law and a daughter-in-law all work for Anotek.
The business dates from 1982 and is Donald Dalgoutte's second stab at
creating his own business. After leaving Scottish Aviation his first
venture in the field lasted for 13 years but eventually failed. ''I was
encouraged to restart by my customer base,'' he recalls. ''In the first
year I retained up to 90% of them.''
Anotek began in a farmhouse but quickly moved into the same
Nethermains industrial estate where it occupies 18,000sq.ft of space
today. Apart from the kind of specialist printing work it still does for
Polaroid, British Aerospace and the rest of its blue-chip customer list,
Anotek originally had another complementary arm.
The name Anotek is short for Anodising Technologies and, until 1991,
that other arm was involved in chemical engineering, repairing parts for
aero engines for the likes of the then Caledonian Airmotive. That
business was sold in 1991, around the time Anotek began to focus on a
new opportunity to diversify into the automotive sector.
Anotek was invited by Vauxhall, part of General Motors, to consider
supplying a new component the car giant had developed in-house. The part
was a polypropylene water deflector for fitting inside car doors.
Existing PVC alternatives were found to be degenerating, raising fears
of carbon monoxide gas build-up in vehicles.
Vauxhall was seeking a UK supplier for its new-style deflector. For
the car maker, the alternative was not only safer but also more
cost-effective. For a potential supplier like the Dalgouttes, it was a
process they understood, the development work had already been done, and
doing the deal promised massive future volumes, as other GM plants in
Europe were rolled into the equation.
These volumes ran to more than seven million parts a year, with 14
plants taking them. But the politics of General Motors mean that, before
any supplier can begin to count on these numbers, a global sourcing
committee, sitting in Germany, has to give the green light. Anotek went
through that process and was selected as single source vendor for the
new door part.
So the deal was done. Anotek invested just under #500,000 on new
equipment, including a large press, and more on retraining staff to
produce the parts. Production for Vauxhall's Luton plant started in 1992
and, within months, reached an annualised rate of 400,000 units a year.
The part was approved for models like the Astra, Vectra, and Calibra.
Kilwinning started supplying Saab, who were building the Calibra, with
parts too.
But then things started to go wrong. In Germany, the new part was
being failed in laboratory tests for flammability reasons. The
Dalgouttes believe they got enmeshed in intra-GM politics and pressures
from rival German suppliers. They claim the criteria on which the part
was being failed, were American criteria which do not apply in Europe.
The upshot was that the expected volumes never came. By April last
year, after 18 months of virtually fault-free supply to Luton, and after
an ultimatum to Vauxhall and GM to sort the issue out, Anotek pulled out
and ceased production of the deflectors. ''We decided enough was
enough,'' says Donald Dalgoutte.
The family reckons the diversification cost them #200,000 in direct
losses. They contemplated legal action but were advised that taking on
the might of GM could cost them their company. So instead they've dusted
themselves down and are now bouncing back.
John Fairlie, Scottish manager of British Steel (Industry), which has
invested #125,000 in Anotek over the past two years says: ''It speaks
volumes for the management and workforce at Anotek that they've turned
the company round after considerable set-backs. I'm sure it has a
healthy future.''

A weekly round-up of vital observations and advice from The Herald's
team of financial writers Your questions answered: by RE Dundas, Chris
Stone, Aidan O'Carroll and Christopher Sims
* I see that there are such things as investment companies which are
apparently not the same as investment trusts. Can you explain the
difference?
* Investment companies are similar to investment trusts but do not
fulfill all the Inland Revenue criteria to qualify for trust status.
Thus investment companies have to pay capital gains tax, whereas trusts
are exempt, though shareholders are liable when they sell their shares.
The criteria include the provision that no single holding must account
for more than 15% of assets; the trust must be a UK-quoted company and
resident for tax purposes; capital gain cannot be paid over to
shareholders and 85% of the income from dividends and interest has to be
paid to shareholders as dividends. Some 70% of income must come from
stocks and shares.
Many investment companies are identical to trusts save for their
offshore domicile, chosen because they are directed at overseas
investors. In this case they may well be exempt from capital gains, in
which case the private investor will not see much difference in tax
treatment.
* Most of my working life to date has been spent abroad and it seems
likely with my new job that I will be required to work in overseas
branches for the next few years. I would, however, like to buy a
property in Glasgow which will eventually be my main residence. If I
take a mortgage for the purchase, will the interest on it be eligible
for tax relief now or not until I take up residence?
* Mortgage interest relief is available on loans to purchase a
person's only or main residence. For this purpose there is an Inland
Revenue concession which allows temporary absences of up to four years
to be ignored if the person's employment requires a move from property
occupied before departure or if the property has been purchased but
occupation is prevented because of the move. This four-year period will
re-apply if the house can be re-occupied for at least three months
during a four-year stretch.
In these circumstances, the full length of the period of absence
abroad is ignored for mortgage relief purposes and also for the main
residence exemption to apply for capital gains purposes.
* Will you please answer the following two questions. What is my
holding in Saltire shares when I have certificates for 1000 Cannon
Street Investments shares and 1000 Saltire shares? How can my wife and I
convert a joint holding into a single person holding without going via a
broker?
* Cannon Street Investments has changed its name to Saltire and the
certificate in that name is now the valid one. The original Cannon
Street certificate can be thrown away.
In respect of your second question, you buy a stock transfer form for
a small price from a legal stationer, complete it and send it with the
relevant share certificate to the company's registrar, whose name and
address -- if you don't know it -- can be obtained by writing to the
company secretary. The registrar will in due course send a replacement
certificate in the new name, for which he or she may possibly charge a
small fee. In case you are puzzled by the stamp duty section on the back
of the form, your transfer will fall under category ''L'' and,
therefore, be exempt.
* I have several unit trusts invested in North America and I am
disappointed with their performance given the strength of the US stock
market. I don't understand why they have not at least kept pace with the
Dow Jones index. Is it something to do with the strength of the pound or
what? Should I continue to hold them?
* You are right to feel puzzled because hardly any unit trust
investing in North America has kept pace with the US indices. Over the
past six months the average such trust has shown a rise of 7.5% compared
with 17% for the Dow Jones index, a significant under-performance. Over
the past year the comparison is just as bad, with a 13% average gain
comparing with 28% in the Dow Jones.
The problem for the funds has been that the sharp rise in the US
market this year has been driven by a few sectors, notably technology
stocks. The Nasdaq index, which includes many of these, has increased
35% over the past year. Some sectors have not achieved nearly as much.
So if a trust was invested in the wrong sectors it would not have done
well. Few have had the necessary exposure to the technology sector to
participate fully in the rise.
Currency movements have had nothing to do with the recent
under-performance as sterling has changed little against the dollar in
the past six months. Over the past year there has been a disadvantage of
some 2% from a weaker dollar.
After such a heady rise, there is some nervousness about the speed of
the US rally, but a recent correction was immediately reversed and it
still seems to have plenty of steam left. However, the higher it goes
the greater the risk of a sharp correction, so you should soon be
thinking of lightening your holdings.
* In June, 1990 I retired early and I was looking for an investment
with growth. I invested #20,000 with Royal Heritage Life Assurance
through a fund manager called Siltala, with #10,000 in a special
opportunities fund and #10,000 in a regular income fund. Siltala was
suspended by FIMBRA and the portfolio was transferred to Johnson Fry on
October 1992 with a market value of #18,500. Johnson Fry reinvested in a
lower risk zone, half in compound interest fund and half in compound
growth fund. Five years on the portfolio stands at #20,653. Not much
growth here. Should I ask for a change of portfolio or invest elsewhere?
* Given the conservative nature of the investment, 12% growth over
nearly three years is actually not too bad, though perhaps it is time
for a rethink. First of all you should consider again exactly what you
want from the investment. If it is still capital growth then the degree
of risk you are prepared to take has to be decided. This is really a
question of timescale. If you will not need the money for say five years
then you can afford to take more risk than if it could be needed in two
years time. If the latter then there should be no equity content at all
and you should stick to National Savings or the building society.
Assuming the investment is for the long term you still need to know
what the ultimate aim is. For example if you intend to use the money to
raise your income in old age then it might be worth using PEPs now. If
this is the case you could consider one of the corporate bond PEPs, such
as the one offered by Guinness Flight, reinvesting the income until you
want to take it.
If you can take a five-year view then you should consider greater
equity exposure, such as through investment trusts like Foreign &amp;
Colonial and Law Debenture Corporation and unit trusts like Schroder UK
Enterprise and Perpetual UK Growth.
* I enclose some data pertaining to my ''Save Insure and Prosper''
plan with a 15-year term which is due to mature in April next year. I am
no expert but it would seem to me from the statement of account for the
year to March 1995 that this plan is on a downward spiral. A call to the
investor services department to question the latest statement was met
with ''well, South East Asia Growth Fund was always very speculative''.
News to me.
The surrender value quoted for this month (copy enclosed) would seem
to bear this out although the bid price of the units seems to have risen
slightly. I am utterly confused and would value your advice on whether
to hold on for the last few months to maturity, or would you advise me
to take my money and run?
* If you were not told that the South-East Asian fund was volatile
then you were badly advised. But you have not done too badly. Though the
Save &amp; Prosper fund has performed below the average for its sector in
recent years, your policy is still worth some #5200 against the #2200
you have paid in, which includes a proportion for life insurance.
The South-East Asian stock markets have not seen the improvement which
the UK has witnessed this year because they ran too far ahead of
themselves in 1993. But the underlying economic growth of the region
remains strong and is likely to continue so. Once the economy has
''caught up'' with the stock markets they will move ahead again. There
is a reasonable chance this will happen by next April but as with all
stock market investment there is also a risk of a fall. Markets
everywhere would be affected by a drop in the US market, for example. So
long as you don't need the money you should hold on.
* I retire in the autumn with a fair pension and a lump sum, which I
will use to top up my existing portfolio of shares. My wife and I intend
to live in our house on the Fife coast and to sell our home in Bearsden.
We expect to obtain about #140,000 for this and to spend #15,000 to
#20,000 on various improvements and renovations necessary in Fife. There
are no mortgages on either property.
We would like to enjoy our retirement while we are fit to do so, and
intend to spend quite a bit of money on holidays both at home and
abroad. To finance this we would like to invest the remaining proceeds
from the sale of our Glasgow house to produce a good income. Building
society investment is one possibility for this, but I am reluctant to be
too dependent on this source of income because of the way interest rates
move up and down. I would prefer something more secure.
I understand that at 65 I am too young to benefit from the purchase of
an annuity and wonder what you can suggest. After investing the lump sum
from the pension fund I will have more than #150,000 in equities for
capital growth rather than income. I will still be a higher rate
taxpayer, but my wife is not, and I intend to invest the holiday funds
in her name so that we do not have to pay extra tax on the income?
* It would seem that you will have around #120,000 to invest in your
so-called holiday fund. A good way of obtaining a high secure return is
to invest in gilts or corporate bonds. It is still possible to get
returns of around 7.5% to 8% gross from gilts, which is more than can be
obtained from building societies. The secret is to buy stock below par.
This reduces the risk of capital losses since the stock is redeemed at
par at the due date. The interest is fixed until redemption. Corporate
bonds offer slightly higher returns but can be riskier.
If the whole #120,000 was invested in this way your wife would receive
a net income of around #6750. Depending on her exact income she might be
able to claim some of the tax credits back.
However, this would give you a somewhat unbalanced portfolio since
nearly 45% of your funds would be in fixed-interest stocks. Some of the
holiday funds should be invested in extra equities for growth of income
and capital. You have to take account of future inflation and in the
case of holidays abroad the possibility that the pound might fetch less
on the foreign exchanges.
We understand your reasoning in allocating funds specifically to
provide income for holidays, but it might be better to estimate how much
you intend to spend in this way and add it to your normal budget
arrangements. Your total funds should then be invested in such a way as
to meet your income needs.
You would need a stockbroker to purchase gilts and invest your lump
sum. A frank discussion with him should enable a suitable portfolio of
investments to be set up. Gilts should play some part in this, but how
much depends on your anticipated spending.
* I am involved in looking after the estate of my brother who died
earlier this year. It appears that there are various changes to the
normal capital gains tax rules when dealing with the assets of a
deceased person and it would be helpful if you could give me a brief
summary of these changes?
* When someone dies, the death is not treated as an event which gives
rise to any capital gains tax but the personal representatives must
include in the deceased's final tax return for the period April 6 to
date of death any capital gains which have arisen on disposals during
this period and pay over any tax due to the Inland Revenue. If the
deceased had a net capital loss for the tax year of his death, it may be
set against gains the previous three tax years starting with the latest,
and any repayment of tax which this produces will be refunded to the
estate. Unused losses cannot, however, be carried forward against gains
made on disposals of assets after death.
There are no capital gains tax charges on the disposals of assets by
your brother's executors to beneficiaries under the terms of his will or
the laws of intestacy. The beneficiaries are regarded as having acquired
the assets at the market value at the date of death. However, assets
sold by the personal representatives must be reported to the Revenue who
will assess any gains which have accrued in the period from date of
death to date of disposal.
Only the increase in value from date of death is taxed less any
inflation allowance for the same period. Losses on disposals during this
period will be deducted from the gains in the normal way. The executors
are entitled to a full annual exemption for the remaining part of the
tax year in which your brother died and the two following tax years.
If your brother's estate included investments liable to inheritance
tax, and these fell in value and were sold within 12 months of death,
the executors can claim to pay inheritance tax on the reduced value. In
that case the value for inheritance tax purposes is also the value used
for capital gains tax purposes.
* My wife has been told by the DSS that she will be due her retirement
pension from next year even though it will be two years before I qualify
for a State pension. I was under the impression that married couples had
their pension paid together and wonder why my wife qualifies now and
what will happen in two years time?
* Many married women now reaching retirement age will have been paying
national insurance contributions at a reduced rate which do not provide
any entitlement to State pension. In these circumstances their pensions
are, as you say, paid with their husband's on his retirement at age 65.
The amount of pension payable to a married woman by virtue of her
husband's contributions is #35.23 per week.
Your wife appears, however, to have been paying full national
insurance contributions for at least part of her working life and has
therefore qualified for a pension in her own right. The amount of this
pension will have a bearing on what happens when you retire. If her
contributions were sufficient to entitle her to a full pension she will
continue to receive this when you reach age 65. If, however, her own
pension is less than the married woman's rate of #35.25 it will be
topped up to this level when you retire.

WITH an average age in the late fifties, more and more British dairy
farmers are expected to quit the business and cash in their milk quotas
to provide a pension.
Senior executives at Dalgety Agriculture reckon almost one in three of
Britain's 35,000 dairy farmers will leave the industry in the next five
years.
Most of these will be in the peripheral regions of South-west and
North-west England, Wales and South-west Scotland. At current price of
around 60p per litre a typical dairy farmer could realise an instant
pension fund of around #200,000 by selling his quota.
But this is only the tip of the iceberg, according Don Phillips, the
company's sales and marketing director.
''I reckon that by the year 2000 there will be no more than 50,000
professional farmers in the United Kingdom producing not far off 90% of
agricultural output,'' he said.
The remaining 10% would come from what could be described as ''hobby''
farmers. Some of these could even become sales representatives for
agricultural supply companies which would have to rationalise their
sales forces.
This rationalisation would extend throughout the industry. He
predicted that neither the national farmers unions nor the 70-odd trade
bodies representing various interests would be able to continue without
substantial re-engineering.
''We can't afford 70 bodies and their staffs in an industry where the
number of serious farmers and growers totals 50,000.
''I suggest now is the time to start reviewing the structure. It will
take five years to sort out if normal patterns of change are followed.
Let's be quicker if we can'' he told a London news briefing.
Rodger Trewhella the company's milk liaison manager, predicted about
10,000 producers would quit in the next four to five years.
Age, economics, and a lack of a succession plan would be the main
factors causing this, but increased demands from supermarkets for farm
animal welfare assurance and traceability of product would be
contributory factors.
''In high population areas, such as the central belt of Scotland, I
would have thought the high demand for liquid milk will ensure
production continues there.
But coming further south, around the borders and down into Cumbria it
will become increasingly marginal and this will continue into Wales and
down into Cornwall and Devon.''
Only by accepting a lower price or by getting ahead of the game on
farm assurance and traceability would producers in these and other
peripheral areas be able to survive, said Mr Trewhella.
But it was not all bad news particularly for the leaders in the field.
Dr Stuart Marsden, technical development manager, said the top 10%
producers in the company's herd recording scheme were making margins per
hectare more than 30% higher than the average.
For a typical 50 hectare dairy unit this was worth an extra boost in
herd of more than #38,000.

FUND managers Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets (FCEM) has been
fined #37,500 by investment industry regulator Imro and is also paying
#22,411 in costs, writes ANDREW WILSON.
The disciplinary proceedings arose from a routine investigation last
year by Imro which led to two charges. One was for failing to ensure
that sufficient information was recorded and retained and the other that
it also did not comply with responsibilities under the regulatory
system.
The problems appear to have arisen after Foreign &amp; Colonial Management
bought a controlling stake in Latin American Securities and had its name
changed to FCEM on same day, July 1, 1993.
Between September and January 1994, the managers failed to retain
records of investment decisions on some dealings in Latin American
stocks. They also did not record the cancellation of some limit orders
as these automatically lapsed if the target prices were not achieved.
There was not an adequate recording after the takeover and the
procedures manual was not updated to reflect changes after the
reorganisation.
None of the problems involved any losses to clients.

COMMENT
SCOTTISH &amp; NEWCASTLE was quietly grinding its teeth in frustration
after being told yesterday that it was almost certain to be allowed to
buy Courage without a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
-- but not yet.
The brewery sector is set to enter period of great change. Jonathan
Evans, the Competition and Consumer Affairs Minister, said he was going
to accept various undertakings from S&amp;N instead of the reference to the
MMC.
He has asked various interested parties, the two most important
probably being Bass and Whitbread, to comment on the text but not the
substance of the S&amp;N undertakings by next Thursday, August 10.
This seems nit-picking of a high order even for a solicitor -- Mr
Evans' job before assuming office. He was drafted in to decide on the
matter because President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang preferred to
stand aside having had earlier discussions with S&amp;N in his former role
as Scottish Secretary.
Certainly S&amp;N has got off lightly with the disposal of 115 pubs to
reduce its new permitted total to 2624 outlets. That is probably less
than the additional beer volume for just one of these fine summer days
-- particularly as it could be selling only dregs of the estate barrel.
The Office of Fair Trading has advised that some competitors wanted
S&amp;N to sell off breweries and/or brands. However, the brewery disposals
would not be an effective way of dealing with the competition concerns,
as there was already too much excess capacity in the industry.
Although there is a case for forcing S&amp;N to divest its licensed
brands, which include Becks, Hofmeister, Kronenbourg and Coors, the big
brand owners would be most likely to move the licences to other major
brewers with the distribution and marketing strength, and which already
have significant brand portfolios.
The other brewers now about to compete with a Scottish Courage with a
31% market share on the traditional calculation of volume sold, are
rightly wondering about the basis of the Government's competition
policy.
Allied Domecq has recently asked for the obligations imposed at the
time of the formation of Carlsberg-Tetley in 1991 to be set aside in the
wake of the leniency shown towards S&amp;N. These include bringing forward
the ending of a supply agreement to Allied pubs to December 1997. That
may also have a strategic purpose
Whitbread apparently offered significantly more than S&amp;N for Courage,
but there was a clash of personalities between the Whitbread management
and Foster's Brewing, which owns Courage.
Now it will be looking hard at the other brewery in play in the form
of Carlsberg-Tetley, with 17% market share to add to the 14% of
Whitbread, to create a group approximately the same size as Scottish
Courage.
An OFT dispensation on the earlier restrictions would virtually
guarantee a clear run for Whitbread without any fear of an MMC
reference.
Certainly Allied Domecq will need little moral persuasion to sell.
Chief executive Tony Hales is on record as saying that brewing will not
receive any additional capital. The caution is understandable given the
general acceptance that the merger of Carlsberg and Tetley has yet to
come together, and that any improvement in profitability is a long way
off, with perhaps #50m of restructuring costs to be incurred over the
next few months.
That in part explains the raft of disposals in the last year of the
food interests and even this week of the Black Bottle scotch sale to
Highland Distilleries for #12.8m.
Allied Domecq does need cash and asset sale profits to make the next
set of results look at all respectable with shareholder confidence still
shaken by the unhappy experiences in Mexico at the beginning of 1995
when the peso was collapsing.
There is the thought that if Whitbread were to relieve the company of
its brewing, why stop there?
The pub assets could be floated as a major pub company. The spirits
business, which is the world's number two behind Grand Metropolitan's
IDV, would be an attractive investment either as an independent entity
or part of another consumer group, while the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream
and Dunkin' Donuts international franchises would also find good homes.
These may be a better way of realising shareholder value than by
maintaining the group in its present shape. Certainly one cannot see any
light on the horizon otherwise.

GLASGOW-based property company Halladale, which has been trading for
only three years, has its sights firmly set on a Stock Exchange listing,
writes IAN McCONNELL.
In the company's latest annual report, chairman David Lockhart reveals
that the board is considering a merger with a company which is already
listed, a direct introduction to the principal market in conjuction
with, or following, an expansion of its asset base, or an introduction
to the Alternative Investment Market.
He said the board and the company's advisors would keep the matter
under constant review, so action could be taken quickly when the timing
was right.
Mr Lockhart believes property companies wishing to succeed over the
longer-term should have access to a complete range of financing
alternatives.
Halladale suffered a 46% fall in pre-tax profits, from #207,475 to
#112,987, in the year to end-March.
The company attributed the reduction to an increase in costs
associated with its expansion programme.
Although rental income advanced from #827,485 to #1.16m,
administrative expenses leapt from #309,974 to #483,357 and interest
charges increased by more than #100,000 to #445,195.
Brian Rout, a former managing director of R Green Properties and
investment trust Throgmorton, has joined the board as deputy chairman
and will spearhead the company's drive towards a listing.
With the appointments of Mark Harkin, from Edinburgh Development and
Investment, as finance director and Michael Baker as a non-executive
director, the number of directors has increased from one to four.
During the year, Halladale has been refurbishing the Greenhills
Shopping Centre in East Kilbride. The centre is virtually fully let,
with a mix of tenants anchored by deep-discounter Kwik Save.
In the same town, Halladale acquired the Calderwood Shopping Centre
during the year.

ELECTRICITY distribution shares soared yesterday as bid fever again
swept the sector on hopes of further takeover bids. That was despite
Trafalgar House saying that it was dropping its attempt to acquire
Northern Electricity.
Northern shares initially fell 94p to 800p then bounded ahead to close
11p better at 905p as shareholders looked forward to receiving the
package of benefits, worth about 500p per share. That was to have been
used to fight off the potential Trafalgar bid which would have been
pitched at 900p.
However, the agreed #2500m Hanson bid for Eastern Group considerably
muddied the waters for Trafalgar. It said yesterday that it had decided
against making an offer and was influenced by both the ''particularly
harsh'' effect on Northern of industry regulator Professor Stephen
Littlechild's revised review, and the price expectations influenced by
the bids for other regional electrcity companies.
Last night, there were three takeovers on the table. In addition to
Hanson for Eastern, ScottishPower has made a hostile offer for Manweb,
and Southern Electricity of the US for South Western Electricity, both
at #1000m. But there is growing speculation that either the RWE Energie
utility group or Veba, both of Germany, will soon move.
London Electricity is thought by some, perhaps cynically, the most
likely target to follow the purchases of City merchant banks by German
commercial banks.
As the underlying results from the reginal comapnies are essentially
similar, it does not matter that much which is bought, the main factor
being the size of the bidder's purse.
There is considerable pressure for all the bids to be referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission as a matter of principle, with weight
being added by the National Audit Office, now looking at how the utility
regulators have performed.
Nowhere in the electricity bids have consumers seen much tangible
potential benefit. However, in the water industry, Ofwat regulator Ian
Byatt stirred up the pond when he demanded that Lyonnais des Eaux cut
its bills by up to 20% over the next five years as the price for being
allowed to buy Northumbrian Water. That proved too heavy a burden and
the French company lost interest.
The Hanson move was a major blow to Trafalgar as it effectively priced
Northern out of its buying range, to leave it looking for an
alternative, affordable asset able to supply sustained and growing UK
earnings. Trafalgar shares dipped 2p to a year's closing low of 41p.
In the six months to March it lost #48.2m and faces further
cost-cutting for the engineering construction and Cunard group to come
back onto an even keel. The Jardine Matheson owned Hong Kong Land, with
a 25% stake, has already invested well over #300m and faces a
considerable management challenge to recoup its losses.

EUROPEAN Commission proposals to reduce the rate of set-aside for 1996
from 12% to 10% are over-cautious, says the United Kingdom Agricultural
Supply Trade Association.
Director-general Jim Reed said: ''The commission has recently shown a
proper concern about the effect of escalating grain prices on livestock
producers by suspending virtually all cereals exports.
''With this proposal they should have signalled their determination to
ensure adequate supplies of all arable crops next year.
''World market stocks on both wheat and coarse grains are heading for
a historic low point. The Council of Ministers should be more courageous
when it meets in September and fix the set-aside percentage well down in
single figures.''
* A #275,000 grant from the EU will help Perth Fresh Meat to expand
its avctivities at Inveralmond Industrial Estate, with the labour force
expected to increase from 350 to 500. The grant will be used to invest
in packaging technology.

GLASGOW-based Murray European Investment Trust underperformed during
the first half because of its overweight position in cyclical stocks,
which suffered most from first-quarter fears of an early curtailment of
economic recovery.
Net asset value rose 7.2% to 68.5p during the six months to end-June,
while European stock markets advanced 10.6% in sterling terms.
The perception earlier this year that the US economy was growing too
rapidly, and worries that further monetary tightening by the Federal
Reserve would be followed by the Bundesbank, hit stocks such as Finnair,
Murray European's largest holding.
There were fears that Bundesbank rate increases would cut short
economic recovery in Europe.
With the Fed having now cut interest rates, trust manager David Briggs
said: ''The general view now is that, if the Bundesbank moves after the
summer recess, it is more likely to ease.
''I feel much more comfortable with the way the psychology of the
markets has moved in relation to where it was six months ago.''
Murray European's performance, relative to European stock markets as a
whole, recovered during the second quarter.
During the six months, the environment for European bond markets and
equities improved as the sharp pace of economic growth seen last year
began to ease and inflationary pressures receded.
The #21m Murray Johnstone fund considers the slowdown to be perfectly
healthy and does not see any risk of renewed recession in current
economic data.
Mr Briggs said: ''The probability of an extension to the perceived
economic cycle should be positive for corporate profits and equity
valuations in Europe.''
French equities account for 28% of the portfolio, with 14% of the fund
invested in Germany and 10% in both Spain and Finland. The remainder of
the portfolio is spread between another eight European countries.
The trust, which focuses on capital growth, does not pay an interim
dividend.

SOME people believe that highbrow culture, such as opera, jazz, poetry
and the Edinburgh Festival, is somehow far superior to popular culture.
The same people generally believe that highbrow culture is better for
you, that to consume it is to be part of the creme de la creme, that it
is the proper British culture and that it is an area of refinement with
which any art form worth its salt should be compared. But the
superiority of highbrow culture is a myth.
The public gets what the public wants and this is especially true of
pop culture. Popular culture runs as a business, a simple case of supply
and demand. Popular culture services the world's public because it
depends on their money to survive. This is the huge difference between
highbrow and popular culture. Highbrow culture is subsidised.
The natural laws of the economic jungle, where, if no-one buys, you
die, do not apply to highbrow culture. Therefore highbrow culture is
far, far removed from any ideas of what the public will pay to see.
Take, for example, an arty theatre company who want to put on a play
that no-one will understand let alone buy a ticket for. They are awarded
a grant to put it on because no-one will pay to see it and lo! No-one
comes to see it.
This is where highbrow culture ceases to be part of the real world.
Someone like Susan Sontag epitomises the highbrow artist desperate to
bridge the yawning gap between high art and ordinary life. She was last
heard of putting on plays in Bosnia. But what good can theatre do in a
war zone? When it comes to experiencing conflict first hand, there is no
effective medium other than TV reportage to show us, the public, the
savagery of war.
Consumers have real power. They have the power to forge some kind of
individuality through what they buy. Some people believe that what you
choose to consume is simply an extension of your class, your IQ, your
personality. For example, if you are a Sun reader you're stupid, if you
keep up with fashion you're a victim, if you carry a mobile phone you're
a flash bastard. This is a vulgar philosophy based on making big
assumptions about complete strangers. It is nearer the truth to say that
the mass consumption of popular culture has produced a new kind of
sophisticate. And there are tribes of them, individuating through their
selection of what the commercial world has to offer.
Take the satellite viewer. Contemptuous of tired TV formats (bland
sitcoms, canned laughter) he buys a satellite dish so he can tune in,
whenever he wants, to any channel of his choice. Satellite TV offers
programmes from all over the world and provides a myriad of viewing
possibilities. From sport -- the NBA Basketball Magazine, German League
Football, Sky Soccer Weekend, from news -- 48 Hours, CBS News, Sunrise
Europe, to movies -- Brides of Dracula, Wargames, A Bridge Too Far, to
documentaries -- Challenge of the Seas, Dangerous Earth, Treasure
Hunters. The satellite viewer is a discriminating consumer. He
diversifies into areas of personal interest. He specialises. A satellite
dish is not, as many might believe, an indicator of low moral fibre or
living-room sloth.
But highbrow culture is still regarded by its proponents as a
civilising influence on an unruly world. Highbrow culture seeks to
determine the moral and spiritual values of our time, but completely
dismisses popular culture. The result? A culture high on theory and low
on impact. Highbrow enthusiasts debate endlessly about the state of the
world, but they do nothing to change it.
The impotence of highbrow culture is best illustrated if you compare
one of its protagonists, say, Susan Sontag, with Sir Bob Geldof. Whereas
Susan Sontag's whole energies are devoted to fabricating a connection
between art and life, Bob Geldof, with Live Aid, devoted his whole
energies into putting on popular art in order to raise money and save
lives. Follow that! Anita Roddick too, uses the medium of a global,
commercial business to forge mutually beneficial links with indigenous
people whose way of life is under threat. What advocate of highbrow
culture has the power to do this?
Most people, most of the time, consume popular culture. Not highbrow
culture. Therefore the zeitgeist is at the very soul of popular culture.
Not highbrow. And anyway, consumers of popular culture want fun. Fun is
a major word in pop vocabulary. Probably used as often as post-modernism
in the highbrow. There you have it. Fun or post-modernism. It's not much
of a contest.

WITH Scotty McClue on holiday, it was another job for Chancer Man,
Yours Truly. I was offered the chance to take callers' flak every night
between 10 and one for a fortnight alongside Terry McGeadie. Scot FM's
Nightline is an amazing phenomenon.
Even the most optimistic radio exec must be amazed at the response
elicited by this format -- a new one for Scottish night-time radio.
Since December, Sco'y (as with all words that are used frequently, the
pronunciation of the host's name has evolved to an exceptional degree,
the glottal stop continuing to evolve, leaving virtually no gap where
the ''t'' used to be: if the letter continues to shrink, even the
apostrophe will become redundant) has had his voice blaring through
every taxi I've clambered into during darkness hours.
The driver might like him, will more likely loathe him, but his
admiration is as inevitable as the good man's reactionary
pronouncements. More than one late-night cabbie has pronounced his work
to me as ''genius''. That a late-night show on a previously beleaguered
station has attracted a vast audience, is surprising. That the audience
encompasses such a broad sweep of Scottish society, is astonishing.
How can the mix work? Lowbrow calls sit somehow so easily beside the
highbrow spreads they inspire in quality broadsheets. Why? Is the
Scottish acceptance of the Americanised radio format so surprising?
The pattern of the show is fairly constant. At the top of the show,
the host's job is to set a topic for the night's discussion. This is
vital, as it is important that the callers have something to ignore when
they phone up. Usually Terry or I would scan the papers, searching for a
story that elicits the merest hint of outrage or affront, no matter how
fleeting. Armed with this, we would announce in solemn tones what
exactly angered us, hopefully in as controversial a way as possible, so
that listeners might feel a similar sense of indignation, whether at the
story or at our interpretation, and phone in with their point of view.
For many reasons, this does not work on the Sco'y show. For a start,
the phone lines jam from about 9.45 onwards. It seems that the entire
nation sits by the phone from mid-evening, and no amount of feeble
invective from a couple of tubby chancers is going to deflect them from
making a point on their original field of discussion.
The first half-hour of the show, therefore, is probably the radio
jock's equivalent of a computer game. Most of the callers at this time
are teenagers, and usually they're just trying to indulge in a bit of
verbal graffiti; swearing live on-air in an effort to save them writing
it on the wall of the public convenience. Terry quickly became a master
at anticipating swear words seconds before they were uttered. Often, we
learned they would be preceded by the phrase ''Can I just say one more
thing?''
Every evening the discussion takes on a complete momentum of its own,
and subjects brought up by the first few callers invariably catch the
imagination of the public far better than the token pseudo-outrage of a
couple of so-called media trendies. Their chosen topics can be anything
from euthanasia (a good thing, they thought) to ghosts (a real thing,
apparently) and Gazza haircuts (not so good).
At first I had some difficulty in dealing with callers who were
looking for advice on coping with a serious or disturbing problem.
What the Celtic soul demands is that you get down to your local
boozer, become maudlin-drunk, and challenge all-comers to a fist-fight.
Next day, the headache, the handcuff marks on both wrists, and the
threat of your name all over the papers should be enough to make you
realise that yesterday's plight was really a bed of roses compared to
today's personal mess.
So naturally, anyone phoning up wanting advice on how to deal with a
violent father, a jealous wife, or an amorous farm animal, left me with
the feeling that I was being taken for a mug. Being faced with these
problems, whether real or imagined, has you walking a bit of tightrope,
when you can be faced with persistent grief, addictions, and
dysfunctional families.
Terry was always in control. He knew exactly what to do. If you're
stuck for something to say, then all you have to do is follow Terry's
Three Point Plan.
1. Summarise the problem in around 10 words.
2. Ask the caller the question ''How does that make you feel?'' then.
3. Offer to ''put it to the nation'', ie ask the public to phone in
with their calls on the subject.
By the time the fortnight was coming to an end, I was in the pub with
Big Jim and he was telling me about his recent woman troubles. Before I
knew it, I found myself saying ''So it looks as if it's all over then.
How does that make you feel?''
It was time to get out. Fast.
The Scottish psyche is a strange thing. Last week a footballer
celebrated a goal at Ibrox with a parody of an Orange Walk. Before the
crowds had left the ground we have column acres full of middle-class
fury and mock outrage. From the front pages (what's an Ayrshire MP got
to do with a Glasgow football game?) to the sports pages (since when did
we have to listen to a sports journalist giving us a lecture on
sociology?) there was never any shortage of doom-laden warnings.
The yards of newsprint, for some reason, presumed that West of
Scotland sectarianism is an issue that is ''too difficult for a
foreigner to understand''. Sadly these divisions are so facile that a
10-year-old boy can understand them -- just look round the ground at any
Old Firm game.
It's easy to see that cretins on one side of the divide will despise
Gazza for his japery, to the same extent that some cretins on the other
side will revere him for it. Instead of feeling outrage about the prank
(for that is all it was), maybe we should be having a laugh.
There are nutters on both sides, that is a regrettable part of
Scottish life, but I see no reason why we should avoid laughing at
ourselves because of this mindless minority. People who would get worked
up about this humorous stunt must be either sensationalists seeking to
sell papers, or loonies. Either way, we should just ignore them, and
accept that the 18,000 Rangers fans present last Sunday weren't
offended, no matter what the papers said. Why shouldn't Gascoigne have a
laugh?
For everyone's sake, let's start enjoying the game, instead of
pandering to the humourless bigoted morons. I reckon it's those who
can't laugh about the incident that have the real problem.

In sweltering temperatures nothing can cool you down like the humble
ice-lolly. Anvar Khan guides a panel of tasters through the best, and
the rest
ASKING men and women to volunteer for The Herald's Great Ice-Lolly
Tasting Test was an instance of the utmost human cruelty. For, in the
world of ice-lollies, great claims are made. Some manufacturers insist
that their ingredients include real fruit juices, others that they spurn
artificial additives.
Upon the mastication of these our judges, however, willing and able
taste buds accurately detected saccharin; otherwise happy palates
suffered disturbing alien aftertastes. The volunteers expressed a
genuine interest in nibbling and slurping new tastes, but a few were
genuinely shocked by what they drew from the scabbard.
Moments of horror included the first glance at the Opal Fruits lolly,
which is a Stonehenge block of bruising; and the incomprehension of a
fat ice-pole in rainbow colours, the exact replica of a set of five
rolls of streamers in a party pack. Here, however, is what they all
said, before they asked to be excused for a sit down and a glass of
water.
* Testers: Chris Mack, Brian Slevin, Robert Grieve, Gemma Stoddart and
Julie Morris.
* Brand: Rowntrees Fruit Pastilles.
Price: 65p.
Marks out of 10: 8/10, 9/10, 9/10, 7/10, 6/10.
Total: 39/50.
Chris: Eyecatching and really sweet. Good aftertaste, and it's not
boring because there's different flavours. Not much for 65p but I would
definitely buy it.
Robert: A pretty smart lolly, a great product for kids. On a hot day,
you need a fruity one.
Julie: Smells sherbety. The pole design is easy to sook and there are
layers of different taste sensations.
Brian: Looks like a rocket. It's lovely. At 65p it's not worth it;
you're paying for the label. It does taste like the different Fruit
Pastilles but the price lets it down.
Gemma: It looks like a Paris fashion hat, the Leaning Tower of
Pastille. The lemon's quite refreshing but a bit tangy.
* Brand: Marks and Spencer Belgian Chocolate Ice Cream.
Price: 89p.
Marks out of 10: 6/10, 6/10, 7/10, 9/10, 9/10.
Total: 37/50.
Chris: The chocolate is crunchy, cracks and falls all over the place
but that's part of the fun. Quite a sophisticated ice-cream. You know
it's an M&amp;S product because there's nothing exciting to it.
Robert: It doesn't have much taste, the ice-cream might be vanilla but
it's weak.
Julie: Easy going, smooth, with double cream. Interest in eating it
wanes.
Brian: Delicious, it tastes elegant. I'm surprised at the price, you
can buy Galaxy or Magnum for less. A luxury item.
Gemma: The chocolate is real chocolate. It's more like a dessert, it's
too sweet to eat to cool down. It's 321 calories but I don't care. I
love it.
* Brand: Walls Strawberry Split.
Price: 55p.
Marks out of 10: 5/10, 7/10, 8/10, 9/10, 8/10
Total: 37/50.
Chris: The ice-cream inside is boring Cornish. The strawberry is
refreshing. I don't like the way the ice-cream melts before the ice and
runs down your hand.
Robert: A bit basic-looking but it's been out for a while. You can
tell it's a strawberry fruit.
Julie: The ice is lovely, like biting into a fresh strawberry
marinated in jam.
Brian: Not the most glamorous lolly but it's a classic. Very sharp.
The ice-cream looks a cheap quality but tastes okay, but 55p is
outrageous, it should be 30p.
Gemma: Looks a wee bit bland but maybe that means there's less food
colouring. The stick's a bit short. They could encase the ice-cream
which leaks out the bottom to stop you getting sticky fingers.
* Brand: Walls Feast.
Price: 60p.
Marks out of Ten: 7/10, 7/10, 6/10, 6/10, 8/10.
Total: 34/50.
Chris: Wholesome, nutty and filling. This has the thumbs-up. I've
always liked the idea of the chocolate bar in the middle.
Robert: The dark chocolate is a bit strong. A reasonable lolly.
Julie: Too sweet, too runny, although the flecks on the skin provide a
pleasant chews.
Brian: It looks crumbly and is very fragile, the sort of lolly you
have to keep an eye on. It's a pure sugar rush. Too chocolatey.
Gemma: I eat these quite a lot. They are sweet and disgusting but I
love them. They're my chocolate fix.
* Brand: Mars Blackcurrant Spangles.
Price: 30p.
Marks out of 10: 4/10, 8/10, 3/10, 10/10, 7/10.
Total: 32/50.
Chris: Strange. The flavouring is weak, as if they got water, poured
Ribena into it and froze it. Reasonable value for money.
Robert: A strong taste. Doesn't melt as easily in the mouth.
Julie: A putrid bright plum colour which tastes like medicine.
Brian: A normal lolly. It looks plain with no hidden secrets. 30p is
good for ice on a stick. The simple touch for simple taste.
Gemma: It looks like nail varnish and despite the manufacturers claim,
there's more sugar in it than fruit juices, which is a bit of a con. But
good on a hot day and bang on for 30p.
* Brand: Mars Opal Fruit.
Price: 65p.
Marks out of 10: 6/10, 8/10, 2/10, 2/10, 3/10.
Total: 21/50.
Chris: This is novel because it has an interesting design on the bar.
Has a convincing fruit flavour. The contrast in flavours is good, the
outside is bitter and the inside sweet.
Robert: A lot of detail on the lolly for one colour. It actually
tastes like Opal Fruits. I'd buy it.
Julie: For vampires only. The purple ice is gritty and the surrogate
mousse-effect filling tastes as sickly as sticking a whole packet of
Opal Fruits in your mouth at the same time.
Brian: My God, steak on a stick. It looks bloody which is off-putting.
It's howling, it doesn't taste nice at all. And the price is well
out-of-order.
Gemma: This looks like something out of an accident. It's black, so I
don't understand why there are designs of oranges and strawberries on
it. It looks like fruit concentrate. The consistency of the middle is
Angel Delight gone wrong, not that Angel Delight is that brilliant.

The garden can be hazardous to tots, warns new mother Eileen Crone
* IN this glorious summer, many Scottish children are discovering the
delights of playing in the garden for the first time. But it is not just
a haven with endless possibilities for adventure; the garden can also be
a danger to toddlers.
Certain plants -- some enticing and brightly coloured, others
innocuous-looking -- can be irritants and even poisonous, and hot
weather can add to a child's sensitivity.
Throughout the summer, family doctors, local accident and emergency
departments, and children's hospitals around the country regularly
receive calls from anxious parents after children swallow or come into
contact with harmful plants.
If you are creating a garden from scratch, careful design and choice
of plants should minimise potential risks. If, however, you inherited
your garden, what lurks in the flower beds may pose a threat.
Would you know which plants to avoid? The well-named deadly nightshade
is perhaps the most obvious example, but what many gardeners consider
normal plants, widely available in garden centres, can pose a serious
threat.
New guidelines on hazardous plants should help. By autumn 1997, every
poisonous plant should should carry a warning label, under a code drawn
up by the Horticultural Trades Association in consultation with the
National Poisons Unit at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals, and the Royal
Botanic Gardens at Kew.
The guidelines contain detailed information of 109 plants or plant
groups and groups them according to their danger levels. There is only
one plant in the most toxic Category A (poisonous if eaten) and that is
poison ivy. The remaining ones fall into Category B (toxic if eaten) or
Category C (harmful if eaten).
Other dangers are posed by irritant plants which could cause various
forms of dermatitis and are categorised B1-B4 and C1-C4. Although the
labelling code is voluntary, it is believed that most plant suppliers
and retailers will use it.
Richard Tibenham, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents
(RoSPA), says: ''Supervision is the easiest way to avoid accidents, but
those looking after children in a garden must know what is and isn't
dangerous.''
Fortunately, many plants that can induce vomiting or diarrhoea have an
unpleasant taste which can often deter children from sucking or biting
them. If a child has become ill from eating a plant, do not try to
induce vomiting. For skin or eye irritation, wash the affected area with
clean water. If in doubt, seek medical advice.
Dr Dorais Wamy is consultant in charge of casualty at Glasgow's Royal
Hospital for Sick Children, which has a short-stay ward for observation
and blood tests. He says that if you can take the plant with you, it
will make identification and treatment easier. Dr Wamy recommends
adequate clothing to protect against the chemical reactions some plants
produce by direct skin contact. Parks and public gardens are careful
with the plants they stock and are safe for children; but in my own town
garden, inspection revealed a number of dangers to my one-year-old
daughter Georgia and her little playmates -- laburnum, two varietes of
euphorbia, lily-of-the-valley, honeysuckle, partridge berry, columbine,
ivies, holly and more.
Since there are plenty of non-poisonous plants to choose from, I'll be
disposing of many of these dangerous plants in the autumn, and meanwhile
I'll keep a careful eye on where Georgia strays.
Some plants and shrubs are ideal for kids -- bright, cheap annuals
like marigolds and dwarf cornflowers or perennials like pinks, London
Pride and bedding plants like pansies. With a little encouragement and
practice, they will enjoy nurturing their own patch in safety.
Now all I have to worry about is handfuls of gravel being chewed, and
a hard stone patio to fall on. And that's before she climbs her first
tree.
* Useful sources of information: The Royal Hospital for Sick Children,
Dalnair Street, Yorkhill, Glasgow. Tel: 0141 201 0078 (Casualty
Department). * RoSPA, Cannon House, The Priory Queensway, Birmingham, B4
6BS. Tel: 0121 200 2461. (For an sae, they will send an information
leaflet; they also have three posters, at #10 each, on plant safety, one
dealing with the garden. * Poisonous Plants and Fungi -- an illustrated
guide (#9.99) published by HMSO. From John Smiths, 57 St Vincent Street,
Glasgow, or HMSO Office, 71 Lothian Road, Edinburgh.
FOR THE CHILD GARDENER
* CHILD-SIZE tools can make gardening for tots easier and more fun.
They often double-up as sandpit toys. Early Learning Centres stock
reassuringly rounded garden toy-tools. Such as:
* Little Gardener (#3.75) to inspire beginners aged 2-6. The set
contains everything toddlers need, including rake, spade, flower basket
and watering can.
* Four-item garden hand tools set (#2.99; see picture above) for those
aged 3 and over.
The Wheelbarrow Playset (#19.99), with integral tank and hose, is
ideal for children between 2 and 6; while for older children (4-6) there
are robust Brio Tools priced from #1.99.
Findlay Clark and other garden centres stock attractive children's
garden gloves -- at #1.69 in fabric and #2.99 with leather palm. Mini
garden aprons cost #4.80, and there's a minature wooden garden bench at
#24.99.
Findlay Clark also stocks brightly-coloured tools for children.
TEN TIPS FOR SAFER GARDENS
* Keep ornamental and edible plants in separate parts of the garden.
* Keep tools and garden chemicals in a locked garden shed.
* Teach your children not to eat berries, fruits, seeds or any other
part of a plant.
* Children and adults should wash their hands after garden play and
especially before eating.
* Be vigilant around ponds, pools or water. A small child can drown in
one inch of water.
* With plants where berries or seed pods are the greatest danger, try
to deadhead the plants before it can set seeds or produce fruits.
* Make sure you can supervise the children from the house (an
overlooking window is ideal) or garden (open trellis or brickwork
between areas is better than the complete screen of a hedge or
fencing/walls).
* Keep animals out of play areas.
* Place play equipment where there will be a soft landing -- grass,
bark or sand. Test the equipment regularly.
* Apply sunscreen, especially between 11am and 3pm, and put on sun
hats.

SO HOW did you feel the other week when the jury in the Susan Smith
trial sentenced her to life imprisonment, instead of death, for the
murder of her two children? You should, as a right-on kind of person,
have been relieved. After all, America was being deprived of yet another
opportunity to strap someone in a chair and fry them. But perhaps, just
perhaps, there was a nagging doubt at the back of your mind. Maybe, when
you considered the nature of the crime, a little voice told you that she
actually deserved to die.
Still, there is something truly awful about state execution. The due
process of death. No matter how wicked, how evil, how sinful, a person
may be is there any justice in depriving them of what's left of their
wretched lives? Lock them up, throw away the key, sure . . . but kill
them?
It's a question which Channel 4 seeks, if not to answer, then
certainly to investigate this week with a series of challenging and at
times provocative programmes which tackle the death penalty debate. The
Lethal Justice season is certainly well-intentioned and
thought-provoking but, in the end, it makes for often harrowing and
frankly depressing summer viewing.
Launching the season, When The State Kills (Wednesday) presents a
cool, considered, if a little short of objective, analysis of the
history and current practise of capital punishment. There is no denying
that the death penalty is becoming increasingly popular in the 1990s
(it's supported by 80% of Americans and by a small majority in Britain),
but is it morally right?
Director Stephen Trombley examines the broad spectrum of views,
including those of former executioners, police, lawyers, and the
families of murder victims. The film also includes the first television
interview with Mikal Gilmore, the brother of Gary Gilmore whose
execution by firing squad in 1977 (''Let's do it'' were his infamous
parting words) marked the return of serial execution to the American
system.
Mikal Gilmore speaks of his brother's suicidal tendencies, his
weariness of a life of crime and punishment, and his virtual taunting of
the state to kill him.
With its mixture of historal footage and contemporary reportage, When
The State Kills reflects upon the age-old themes of capital punishment
-- the ritual nature of execution, the question of its deterrent value,
the selection process of who lives and dies, and the past and present
role of vengeance in our society.
The starkest contribution to the film, however, comes from Don Cabana,
a prison guard who worked on death rows in Missouri and Florida, and
personally supervised the executions of three men. The questions which
Cabana posed -- and the answers he arrived at -- form the conclusion of
this powerful documentary.
The season continues on Thursday with a special edition of The Black
Bag, examining the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther and
convicted murderer who is awaiting execution in Pennsylvania, and
Hanratty, a re-examination of the evidence surrounding the infamous A6
murder of the sixties, for which James Hanratty was convicted and
hanged.
* THERE is only one thing wrong with Marks and Spencers and it is
this: there you are in the queue, with your new St Michael Y-fronts in
your hand, and when you hand them over to the assistant at the till she
always, as a matter of course, shouts out the size in a very loud voice.
This means that the attractive young lady standing behind you, and who
you have just engaged in witty conversation, is made immediately aware
that you favour ''extra-large'' when it comes to undergarments.
Apart from that, Marks and Spencers is wonderful. Indeed, department
stores are wonderful. Especially if you are a bloke. It means that you
can do all your shopping in a one-er. No messing about.
Though Napoleon once sneeringly described the British as a nation of
shopkeepers, it was in fact a Frenchman who opened the world's first
department store -- the Bon Marche -- in Paris in 1869. It was, and
remains, a great cathedral to the retail trade. A city rendezvous for
ladies. An elegant purchasing pleasure palace, designed by Gustav Eiffel
(shortly after he completed work on his more famous tower). The grand
purveyor of everything from haute couture fashion to toys for les weans.
According to Shopping (BBC2, Monday), an intriguing documentary series
on the retail trade, Britain had to wait until 1908 for its first
department store. Gordon Selfridge, an enterprising American, took
several years to buy up an entire block of Oxford Street, shop by shop.
Then, once he'd acquired it all, he took just 12 months to transform it
into a huge emporium with 60 separate departments offering all manner of
merchandise and services, from groceries to steamer tickets.
Going to a department store, according to Michael Southgate, of Adel
Rootstein Mannequins, was a major event in the early days. ''If you
weren't rich enough to go to the theatre or the music hall, you went to
the department store.''
Now, in the mid-nineties, the department store appears to have had its
day. Even the great Macy's in New York almost closed its doors in 1991
(it was only saved from bankruptcy at the eleventh hour). Michael
Southgate laments their passing. Nowadays every department store looks
the same as the next. They concentrate on price and value for money at
the expense of personal service.
* IF YOU have ever wondered why English people have armpits instead of
oxters or why we Scots folk ''mask'' the tea instead of ''brewing'' it,
then The Ken Fine Show (ITV, Thursday) could well provide the answer.
For the next six weeks Ken (the play-on-words alter ego of Absolutely
comic/actor Jack Docherty) will prove that programmes about the Scottish
language don't necessarily have to be earnest, worthy, reverential, and
boring.
Refreshingly, there's neither a Gaelic word nor phrase in sight during
this magazine-style show, made by the Edinburgh-based Hand Pict Films
for Scottish Television. Instead you've got a witty and thoroughly
entertaining examination of our guid Scots tongue (including a folk-rock
version of The Barnyards of Dalgety in this week's opener).
Producer/director George Cathro explains: ''We were trying to find a
concept which would show that Scots is a very lively and vibrant
language which is spoken all over the country, but we didn't want to
make it overly academic. It had to be enjoyable and fun to watch so we
came up with Ken Fine.''
* THIS reporter used to have neighbours who, it seemed, had a party
every weekend. And invariably these parties ended up at four in the
morning with everyone elephant's trunk and singing along to a karaoke
version of ''(Show Me The Way To) Amarillo.'' Every night I was hugging
my pillow . . . over my ears in an attempt to drown out the noise.
According to Public Eye: Love Thy Neighbour (BBC2, Tuesday), I was not
alone. Feuding with the folks next door is on the increase.
This documentary visits a Home Counties house which, in addition to
six children and another on the way, has 20 cats, a rabbit, and a goat
called Fanny. The father of the house has convictions for threatening
behaviour and for keeping dangerous dogs. They are now planning to get a
cockerel. Church mice, it seems, are definitely out.
Their neighbours, understandably, are at their wits end but they can't
force the family-from-hell to move (they own their own home). For their
part, the zoo-keepers accuse their critics of being interfering busy
bodies who don't understand their unconventional lifestyle.
Public Eye reports how some local authorities are now employing
private detectives to spy on nuisance neighbours. But identifying them
is one thing; evicting them another. The process is often impossible.
* NOW well into its second series, Carlton's Moving Story (ITV,
Tuesday) is showing promising signs of being the programme to fill the
yawning gap left by the demise of Minder. Created by Jack Rosenthal (as
a kind of spin-off from his TV movie, The Chain), its above-average
storylines, strong characters, and excellent scripts serve to make it
one of the brightest popular dramas around.
In ''Something Blue'', the wedding day has finally arrived for Kathy
(Emma Amos) and Nick (Con O'Neill). But hours before he gets hitched,
Nick goes off with the Elite Removals lads to do a quick local doobery .
. . job. But for Bamber (Warren Clarke) the responsibility of stepping
in as best man at the last minute is weighing heavily on his mind.

Scottish Open,
BRITAIN'S Alison Nicholas took advantage of an early morning start
when she scored an impressive 67 to set a pace the chasing pack were
unable to match in the second round of the Payne &amp; Gunter Scottish Open
at Dalmahoy yesterday.
Nicholas, a former British Open champion, finished the day at 11 under
par on 133, one stroke outside the Tour record for 36 holes, to lead by
three shots from French duo Patricia Meunier and Marie-Laure de Lorenzi.
Julie Forbes was the best of the Scottish challenge when a second
round of 69 left her on 142, with Curtis Cup player Janice Moodie from
Glasgow one stroke further behind alongside defending champion Laura
Davies.
For the last three years Nicholas has been dividing her time between
the LPGA Tour in America and playing in Europe. In May, she made a major
breakthrough in America when she won the Corning Classic in New York.
This gave the diminutive Yorkshire golfer a three-year exemption with
her only commitment in America being to complete the 15 tournaments
which international membership demands.
''It has enabled me to adjust my playing schedule, which has been a
great help. Laura takes crossing the Atlantic in her stride but I find
it very tiring,'' said Nicholas, who has undertaken fitness exercises to
strengthen her back, and make swing adjustments under the guidance of
coach Lawrence Farmer.
Yesterday, it was a trusted friend in the shape of a 13-year-old Ping
A blade putter which proved a useful ally. ''The hole looked like a
bucket,'' said Nicholas, who gathered six birdies in her round, three of
these at the short holes.
Four of her birdie putts were from 20 feet and over and she safely
negotiated a three footer for par with the putter she has used in all of
her 13 tournament wins since turning professional 11 years ago.
It is now three years since the last of her 10 wins in Europe. When
asked if she could win this week, Nicholas said: ''It may be this week,
it could be next week. You can't tell because there are so many good
players on the Tour now, and Laura could still rip the course apart.''
If Nicholas found the greens to her liking, Meunier and de Lorenzi
found the birdie putts elusive in their respective rounds of 71 and 70.
Meunier, the first-day leader after a 65, had two birdies and an eagle
in her round yesterday.
She holed from 15ft for her eagle 3 at the long ninth on her way
through the turn in 34, and was still nine-under until she found an
unkind lie in a divot to drop a shot at the difficult sixteenth.
DeLorenzi again hit the ball with authority. Three of her five birdies
came at the par-5 holes before a slip-up at the fourteenth. Lorenzi
pulled her second shot there into the front bunker. She then played a
fine recovery to four feet only to miss the putt.
Forbes, the French Open champion, had reached the turn in 35 then
birdied three of her first five holes after the turn before dropping her
second shot of the day at the troublesome sixteenth hole.
Moodie, who has two more years to complete of her scholarship at San
Jose State in California, had struggled to the turn in 38. Her cause was
well served with a birdie at the long tenth, and another at the
fourteenth for a respectable 73 in her first professional tournament.
Not even Davies, the World No.1, can constantly produce the magic
brand of golf she displayed in Ireland last week. After her 71, she
explained: ''It was a bit of an annoying day because I didn't hole any
putts.
She did finish with a flourish -- a 310-yards drive to the last green,
but she pushed her eagle putt of 10ft wide of the hole. ''Ten shots is a
lot to give Alison. She is too good a player,'' she summed up.

Myra Pater brings Rosemary and Basil into your home to...
* WHAT is a herb? As a herb grower, I'm frequently asked that
question.
The dictionary definitions are: a plant with no woody stem above the
ground; one which is not persistent; one that dies down in the winter.
Given that such descriptions would immediately rule out those most
recognisable of herbs, rosemary, sage and thyme, I prefer to subscribe
to the school of thought which holds that a herb is a plant which is
useful to man both medicinally and cosmetically and adds flavour to
foods. Since ancient times, herbs have been said to have sacred and
magical properties.
The earliest reference is, of course, in the Bible, which says: ''And
God said 'Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed and
the fruit tree yielding fruit'. ''
There's no disputing that herbs are more popular now than ever before,
whether for cooking, as homoeopathic treatments, essential oils for
aromatherapy, materials for crafts or simply for the pleasure that their
presence brings to the garden and home.
Supermarkets are stocking a wide range of cut and pot herbs, while
dishes sampled in our ever-increasing choice of ethnic restaurants and
on foreign travel have opened the door to a wonderful selection of
exotic herbs and spices such as cumin, lemon grass, fenugreek, cardamom,
and galangal.
Despite the apparent mystique that once surrounded the cultivation of
herbs, creating a garden, from the simple windowbox or containers in the
kitchen to an elaborate-themed knot garden, is remarkably simple.
Most plants benefit from being sown and raised inside, not necessarily
in a heated greenhouse, before being planted out. The possible summer
exceptions being savory and chervil, which I find is best sown directly
into the ground where it is to grow.
Why can't I grow basil? This seems to be one of the most common
laments, and up until this year, when I triumphed in my own personal
Battle of the Basils, I fully sympathised with reports of plants eaten
by slugs, stripped by aphids or simply keeling over with the cold.
Considering that basil in both bush and sweet form originated in India
and South-east Asia, it's not surprising that our temperate climate
often thwarts all attempts to raise this aromatic plant.
Unless you have a controlled-temperature greenhouse, I would avoid
sowing seed until all danger of frost is over, even if that means
mid-May. Only sterilised seed compost should be used, and as a
belt-and-braces precaution I spray the soil with Cheshunt Compound
before putting in the seeds as well as when the seedlings appear.
Regular spraying with an insecticide of your choice -- although I have
equal success with well-diluted washing-up liquid -- and careful
attention to slug control will result in healthy plants. Unless you have
a completely sheltered environment, such as a courtyard garden or a
sunny balcony, basil thrives indoors, especially if you nip out the
growing tip as soon as the small, white flowers emerge. Put three plants
together in a decorative container and you will have a luxuriant supply
that even Delia Smith would be pleased to have by her side. Marjoram is
another plant which requires more care, and does not really come through
a Scottish winter outdoors, so lift it and keep it in a frost-free
environment. Its sister plant oregano has no such problems; indeed it
may become quite invasive and may need to be divided at the end of the
season. The generic name of both herbs is origanum from the Greek oros
and ganos meaning mountain glamour or joy of the mountain, which is
fitting for such sweet-scented flowers and leaves. Are there particular
superstitions attached to herbs? Given that most meanings and legends
have their roots in practical properties and uses recognised by ancient
peoples, there's a wealth of admonitions, recommendations and taboos
attached to herbs, and parsley seems to be top of the hit list.
Introduced by the Romans to Britain, but certainly used by the Greeks
centuries before, when it was associated with death and burial, it is
now one of the most-used garnishing and cooking herbs.
''Parsley grows for the wicked, and not for the just.'' So says an old
English saying, and there must be many of us waiting for our sins to
find us out, judging by the fine crops of the plant I've seen so far
this year.
It was held in distrust by midwives, probably because of its
birth-controlling properties. Traditionally sown on St George's Day,
parsley was supposed to go down to the devil nine times before
appearing, which may refer to its long germination period. Parsley
should never be given away -- the recipient should either pick it or pay
a nominal sum for it, and there is still a widely-held belief in some
areas that if the woman of the house plants the parsley, then she will
wear the trousers.
Female domination was also predicted in gardens where rosemary grew,
or to put it rather more lyrically, where rosemary grows the grey mare
is better than a horse! Although Shakespearian playwrights referred to
it as the herb of mourning, rosemary was carried in bridegrooms' pockets
to ensure a satisfying and fruitful marriage, and it was suggested that
no bouquet should be without a sprig or two.
Sage, which in China, rather surprisingly, was the main ingredient for
tea at one time, was used by young girls to see the face of their future
husband by plucking a leaf for each stroke of the clock at midnight.
Still sceptical about the magical properties of plants?
If you have one or more daughters, a modest outlay of around #5 could
save you quite literally thousands of pounds per girl and endear you
forever to your bank manager. And what exactly is this wonderful plant,
and how does it work?
A hydrangea, planted by your front door, will ensure that your
daughters will never marry.
Of course, as superstitions don't carry a guarantee, and should the
unthinkable happen, just think what a beautiful background these lovely
flowerheads will make in photographs of the blushing bride.

THE Japanese owners of London's County Hall backed down yesterday
after intense diplomatic pressure and gave British veterans the go-ahead
to hold a VJ Day commemoration ceremony there.
The Shirayama Corporation, which bought the former GLC headquarters
which houses a war memorial, said the decision was taken to demonstrate
its personal apology to the British people -- and all other people in
the world -- who suffered from Japanese cruelty during the Second World
War.
In a carefully worded statement, the corporation said it hoped its
move would persuade the Japanese Government and the whole Japanese
community to make a formal apology to all who suffered and pay proper
compensation to them.
A row had erupted after the corporation, an Osaka-based real estate
company, refused to allow the veterans access to the memorial which
lists the names of veterans who died in the two world wars.
The corporation said the service could go ahead if the branch could
find and pay for seven Japanese veterans to attend but this was
dismissed as financially impossible.
The British Consul General in Osaka intervened and the British
Ambassador, Mr John Boyd, wrote to Mr Takashi Shirayama, the
corporation's president.
Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth is to see off 370
veterans at RAF Turnhouse, Edinburgh, when they fly to London on August
19 to take part in the events that day.
The previous evening, Mr Forsyth is to have dinner with the veterans
when they are accommodated overnight at HMS Cochrane, Rosyth.
A total of 15,000 veterans from the United Kingdom and the
Commonwealth are expected to take part in the service in the forecourt
of Buckingham Palace and the march past the Queen along the Mall.
The Scottish party will fly back to Edinburgh on Saturday evening and
take part in events in the city the next day.
A service of commemoration to be held in St Giles' Cathedral at 4pm
will be attended by the Princess Royal, accompanied by her husband,
Commander Tim Laurence, and an invited congregation including 650
veterans. Mr Forsyth will then host a reception for the participants in
the Royal Museum of Scotland in Chambers Street.
In the evening, a Sunset Ceremony will be held at Edinburgh Castle.
The Princess Royal and Commander Laurence will attend and 500 musicians
will take part. A large video screen is to be erected in Princes Street
west of the Mound to let the public see the ceremony.

Catherine Brown goes in search of a legendary cone
SO, WHAT to choose for a street-walking ice-cream in Edinburgh? Will
it be a not-so-natural tasting, fluffy-textured ''soft scoop whippy'' or
a creamy heavyweight, multi-flavoured American ice? What I really need
is the refreshing, light, cold, clean-tasting, milky-flavoured -- and
familiar from childhood -- taste of a cone from the ''Tally''.
Seeking help, I am encouraged to take a trip out of town to
Musselburgh where the legendary Luca family make classic Italian
ice-cream for purist cone-lickers. But Musselburgh is a long way.
Besides, as I eventually discover, the city centre is not entirely
devoid of possibilities.
Several Italian ice-cream makers continue to make their famous ices,
enjoyed by generations of Scots since the first barrow-pushing
immigrants arrived in Scotland at the turn of the century with their
recipe for palate-refreshing ice-cream.
Classic Italian ice-cream, traditionally made with full-cream milk,
makes less of a creamy ice than those in the French and American mode,
which have a higher cream content. Because of this, the Italian ices are
more icy, taking longer to freeze, which gives them an increased density
and their clear, clean, light taste.
The other important feature of Italian-recipe ices is the low
percentage of air which is beaten in to them during freezing.
''There are three ways to make cheap ice-cream,'' says Stephano Boni,
of Mr Boni's Ice-cream Parlours in Edinburgh. ''Firstly by using cheap
ingredients, such as artificial flavourings and whey powder instead of
milk, secondly by making it in a large-scale industrial plant which
reduces labour costs, and thirdly by beating huge amounts of air into
the product.''
Ice-cream makers would like to see a change in the law. At the moment
there is no legislation to limit the amount of air which is beaten into
ice-cream. It can exceed 200%.
''People don't understand why a quality ice-cream can be so much more
expensive,'' says Boni, ''but if you think of blowing up a balloon,
that's what happens to ice-cream when you start pumping air into it.''
To make ice-cream commercially, the ingredients are first pasteurised,
then homogenised under pressure -- the degree of pressure depends on the
percentage of solids in the mix. The mixture is cooled quickly by
passing through chilled coils. It is then put into an ''ageing'' vat,
where the mixture is left to mature. Then it goes into the freezer,
which may be a batch-type taking about 25 litres at a time, or a
continuous freezer. In the batch-type, which is the most common method
for small-scale traditional producers, around 30%-40% of air is beaten
into the ice-cream. In a continuous freezer any amount can be pumped in
under pressure.
Traditional Italian ice-cream makers are reluctant to declare the
exact percentage of air added, but maintain it is much less than 100%
but not lower than 30%. Stephano Boni claims their level is around 30%.
The Boni family have been making Italian ice-cream in Edinburgh for
three generations. When they began, around the turn of the century,
ice-cream was one of the great pleasures of the urban Scots working
classes, rejected by the middle classes as an unsavoury product made by
wild-looking, unclean foreigners.
GIVING BIG LICKS
Italian ice-cream cone venues in Edinburgh: Mr Boni's Ice Cream
Parlours, are at 4 Lochrin Place, St Mary's Street, and Cochrane Street.
Their range is also sold at The Coney Island Ice Cream outlet in
Waverley Market where they make hot pancakes on a girdle to serve with
the ice-cream.
D Margiotta, 104 Marchmont Road, 115 Bruntsfield Place, and 56 Bridge
Road, Colinton. Makes vanilla flavour, plus around 12 other flavours
which vary.
R D Sotto, The Fudge House of Edinburgh, 197 Canongate.
Vittoria Cafe, 113 Brunswick Street, on a corner halfway down Leith
Walk. Home-made ices made daily in about half a dozen flavours.
Valvona and &amp; Crolla, Italian deli at 19 Elm Row, in Leith Walk, sell
tubs of Luca ice-cream from Musselburgh.

* JEREMY Weller (Directing 20/52, the Grassmarket Project, Traverse
Theatre, Aug 10-Sept 2, various times)
Anything at the Richard Demarco Foundation. Often I just go in there
and look at what's on that day. Sometimes it's ridiculous, sometimes
it's sublime. It's one of the few places that keeps the spirit of the
Fringe alive. For me Demarco is the Festival.
Still/Here, Bill T Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, Edinburgh
Playhouse:
I'm interested to see it because it's much the same theme as what I'm
doing in 20/52 -- it's about loss, a requiem for loved ones who have
died.
Nelken (Carnations), Pina Bausch, Edinburgh Playhouse: I don't tend to
go to that much theatre in the Festival but I do go to music and dance.
Pina Bausch is one of the classic people who transforms dance into
poetry. We all deal with real life but she does it in a way that is pure
beauty.

Conrad Wilson disregards many of the 10,000 'food outlets', but finds
that are worth considering.
IN the Edinburgh Festival's first years, food was low priority. If you
insisted on eating out at night, the Festival Club -- then in George
Street -- was your oasis, serving such richesse as lobster mayonnaise
after a concert. Even the performers congregated there, not least
because there was almost nowhere else to go.
Not that the options were entirely awful. The Caledonian Hotel's
splendidly named but now long defunct De Guise Restaurant made a valiant
stab at a real menu. The Cafe Royal nourished us with its famous lentil
soup. The much-missed Aperitif in Frederick Street provided a flash of
glamour. The Albyn in Queen Street was suavely subdued, but the city's
one and only Chinese restaurant, in Chambers Street, turned oriental
eating into a grim and grubby experience.
Today, it has been estimated there are 10,000 ''food outlets'' in
Edinburgh, though few of them, in spite of their ambitions, can be rated
higher than quite good. On the plus side, the range of cuisine is
remarkably wide. Though Thai, Japanese, Malyasian, and Vietnamese
restaurants are no longer a rarity in Britain, Edinburgh provides these
alongside French, Swiss, Italian, Moroccan, Spanish, Indian and, a
little outside town, South African, which between them supply as vast a
choice as you will encounter this side of London.
At least one of the French restaurants is genuinely French -- ie, it
has a Frenchman in the kitchen -- and the same can be said for more than
one of the Italians. Yet though Edinburgh continues to boast one of the
starriest festivals in the world, it has still to win itself a Michelin
star. Even its Good Food Guide ratings are nothing special, with only
two restaurants measuring up to more than a very meagre score of two
points out of a possible five. When you consider the international
sophistication of the festival city, it's an odd and disappointing
tally.
Part of the problem, I'm sure, lies in the Edinburgh people
themselves, who are simply not prepared to pay for really good food --
the fate of the Japanese Aye Restaurant being a case in point -- and who
respond with horror to what is charged for a good meal in London or
abroad. And because they are uninterested in quality, they seldom get it
at top level. I could name a hundred Edinburgh restaurants much praised
by the locals, which I have tried once and would not dream of returning
to, because the cooking is so ill-focused, the presentation so
maladroit, the menus so unimaginative, the shortcuts so lazy.
Though places in the vicinity of theatres and concert halls are often
to be avoided -- not only in Edinburgh -- some do make an effort to
serve something enticing to people en route to a show or desiring to
relax afterwards. Near the Usher Hall, the Sheraton Hotel's so-called
Terrace Cafe and adjoining Grill Room supply relaxation at a high price,
along with a Franco-Scottish menu that does not always rise to its
aspirations. But if, as I do, you deplore the Usher Hall's wine, it is
certainly worth braving the Lothian Road traffic for the sake of a glass
of the Sheraton's house Fetzer during the concert interval.
Even nearer the Usher Hall is the smart Atrium at 10 Cambridge Street,
within the belly of the office-block that houses the Traverse Theatre.
Though Andrew Radford's cooking is narrow in scope, it is good within
its limits, as the seafood in particular testifies. The decor here is as
provocative as the service -- you'll love it or loathe it -- but that
presumably is the intention. This is a restaurant that makes a statement
and demands a response.
Cheaper and noisier is Loon Fung at 32 Grindlay Street, where the
seafood is above Edinburgh's Cantonese norm and the staff are welcoming,
even at busy times. There is another, slightly calmer, branch of the
same outfit at 2 Warriston Place, near the Botanics, which some prefer,
though I would always opt for Grindlay Street's bustling cheerfulness.
Around the King's Theatre, the best bet is the Bagatelle at 22a
Brougham Place, though its leisurely set dinner is ill-suited to
festival-goers in a hurry. Happily there are also single items to choose
from, even if they don't provide the full French flavour of a place
which, to judge by appearances, must once have been somebody's Victorian
front parlour.
More frenetic, and perhaps more fun, is Pasquale's at 169 Gilmore
Place, which exists triumphantly in a Neapolitan time warp, complete
with singing proprietor, but serves faultlessly garlicky shellfish,
gaudy ices, and -- if the stock has not run out -- bottles of ice-cold
deep southern Locorotondo.
Between the Queen's Hall and the Festival Theatre, two of the most
flavoursome restaurants are South Indian vegetarian. Kalpna at 2-3 St
Patrick Square is the better established, with a wide and authentic
range of dishes, but the Anapurna, across the road at 45 St Patrick
Square, is catching up, thanks to its authentically homely atmosphere
and good spicing.
In comparison, the once good Suruchi at 14a Nicolson Street, right
opposite the Festival Theatre, seems to have grown rather tired (tepid
dishes and lukewarm white wine were recent shortcomings) and is at
present no match for the Italian gusto of Ciao Roma at 64 South Bridge,
which may have dispensed with the theatricality of its centurion
doorkeeper and toga-clad waiters, but remains strong on pizza and pasta.
A few steps away at 22a Nicolson Street, Librizzi's offers more
finesse, though its Sicilian overtones are curiously muted. This,
however, is the nearest Edinburgh gets to a new-wave Italian restaurant,
and it supplies an experience very different from the relentless
Italianism of Giuliano's at 18-19 Union Place, opposite the Playhouse,
or De Niro's at 140 Nicolson Street, near the Queen's Hall.
But some of the most inviting cooking in the area is in the back
streets rather than on the main road. The Phenicia at 55 West Nicolson
Street may look somewhat cramped and comfortless, but its North African
dishes are bursting with pungency. Sunday lunch at the Auberge brings
the real flavour of France -- brilliantly crispy duck surrounded by
whole garlic cloves on one recent occasion -- to 56 St Mary's Street.
And if you have time to stray further afield, there is increasingly good
food to be found in Leith.
Silvio's at 54 The Shore remains the pick of the bunch, thanks to its
antipasti in good olive-oil, its fresh fish, Italian herbs, and
sensational wine list, but the Frenchness of Marinette at 52 Coburg
Street seems no less genuine, even if its mussels and chips are redolent
of nowhere but Belgium.

* A Private Flat, 1993: Veteran Fringe performer Malcolm Hardee
decided to perform in his own rented flat in the New Town, much to the
chagrin of the retired solicitor living in the flat below who threatened
to call the police. Hardee's solution was to give free admission, which
meant that whatever he got up to couldn't be classed as a performance.
* Ladies Toilets, 1987: Those late lamented Australian comedy kings,
the Doug Anthony Allstars, were masters of the scratch venue. After one
raucous Fringe Club gig they led their audience on an invasion of the
ladies' loos where they sang a round of religious ditties, climbed on
top of the (occupied) cubicles, and encouraged the audience to bang its
approval on the ceiling.
* Swimming Baths, 1994: The audience sat in the viewers' gallery while
the Ukrainian company Theatre-on-Podol splashed its way through Iago, a
soggy reworking of Othello in Infirmary Street Baths. The most
impressive entrances involved a dive and a 50m swim and the show
culminated in a double drowning. Oddly, the company had wanted to
perform in a laundry and only settled for the baths as second best.
* An Island, 1989: Richard Demarco is no novice when it comes to
finding out-of-the-way places for his shows. In 1989 he got together a
Scottish company to do Macbeth on Inchcolm Island (after the intended
Italians had cancelled at the last minute) in a production that was
stronger on atmosphere than it was on drama -- not least for the punters
left stranded on the quayside because there were more tickets than there
were seats on the boat.
* A Cave, 1983: Vidor Egg took the art of intimate theatre to an
extreme in his 25-minute Icelandic one-man show performed in
semi-darkness in a specially-made ''crypt'' to an audience of one.
* A Bus, 1994: A simulated sight-seeing tour of the city mutated into
a sci-fi hostage yarn as the Black Ambulance Gang drove its audience
round Edinburgh in a coach. Nice idea, but the execution was lamentable.
* Another Bus, 1988: Australian Rod Quantock filled his bus with 45
passengers a day and drove them to wherever he fancied. He'd look for an
open door and lead  them on a mass gatecrash -- sometimes into other
people's performances.

THAT Irvine Welsh has a lot to answer for, quite apart from being a
Hibs supporter. For one thing, his novel Trainspotting has ruined a
perfectly good jape.
According to this cunning plan the annual ritual of the Edinburgh Pub
Guide for Festival visitors was to be subverted and a collection of
grim, concrete licensed bunkers in housing schemes on the edge of the
city were to be praised extravagantly. The bemused regulars in these
establishments wouldn't know what hit them as strange people with posh
accents clutching Fringe programmes began to wander in, requesting
oak-barrelled Chardonnay and mineral water and asking whether Dr Johnson
had imbibed there.
''Eh, is he the gadgie who runs the Methadone scheme? We've no got
Perrier. Vodka do?''
Ah, yes. What a hoot. But not any more, thanks to the infernal Welsh.
Now, if we direct the cultural tourists to The Gunner in Muirhouse (or
the Penny Farthing or whatever fantastically inappropriate twee name it
goes under these days) the joke will be entirely lost. The visitors will
actually recognise the place. It's probably become quite trendy to visit
such premises, thanks to Welsh.
''Goodness, Roland, isn't this the bar where Tommy and Secks
intervened in the marital dispute to such dramatic effect?''
''Yes, Lucinda, you're probably right and that bookmaker we passed on
the way in will be the one where Rent Boy rolled his sleeve up and
plunged his arm into the blocked toilet to retrieve the morphine
suppositories. Yes, barman, make that two double voddies with Merrydown
chasers!''
Meanwhile the locals will be overheard discussing whether Welsh's work
is emblematic of the linkage in post Thatcherite society between heroin
use and existentialist angst. No, the joke just won't work any more, so
we'll stick to some of the better known of the 500 or so pubs and bars
to be found in the capital and its port. Which is another way of saying
that Edinburgh's reputation for coldness -- physical and social -- can
be misplaced. How could any city with this many great boozers be as
buttoned up as its reputation?
The choice of drinking venue is such a highly subjective affair as to
render the accolade of ''Best bar in Edinburgh'' virtually meaningless.
But what follows here is a list of some -- only some -- of the best to
be found in the city.
First up are the two treasures of the East End, tucked away off
Princes Street behind the equestrian statue known hereabouts as the
Welly Boot. The Guildford is recognisable as the scene of a spectacular
fight in Trainspotting, but don't let that put you off. It is a wee
oasis of opulence reminiscent of a small theatre with its balcony
hovering above like a box at the opera. Next door is the fabulous
Victorian drinking hall of the Cafe Royal.
Rose Street, the lane running parallel to Princes Street, is the
capital's traditional pub crawl. But while pedestrianisation has
rendered this safer the quality of the establishments has fluctuated.
Among the beacons of consistency are Robertson's 37 Bar and the
Abbotsford.
Another street which has a cluster of fine bars is Broughton Street,
which is handy for the Playhouse Theatre. The Barony, near the foot, and
Mathers at the top are two of the best in Edinburgh. Both have elevated
the pub lunch far beyond the simple pie and a pint (although if that is
what you are after, try the Bow Bar in Victoria Street between George IV
Bridge and the Grassmarket). Mathers, incidentally is the name of
another unrelated but excellent bar at the West End which is a haven of
traditional drinking among the many theme bars and meat markets in that
part of town.
The port now boasts a plethora of pubs too numerous to mention, but
the Kings Wark is one of the oldest and is in good shape once again. A
more recent addition to Leith, Tod's Tap, has been renamed The Merman
and it is to be hoped that the changes end there. Further west along the
coast at Newhaven is the Starbank Inn, a fine bar with views across the
Forth to Fife.
Back in the centre of Edinburgh festival-goers are spoiled for choice
for a drink before or after shows, but three bars around the High Street
show the range on offer. The Mitre (returning to its original name after
a stint as Ca Va) is smack in the middle of the action. And although the
interior may be a little garish for some tastes, when the shuttered
windows are thrown open it makes a marvellous viewing point from which
to watch the throngs go by. Cross the High Street from there and head
down the side of the Scandic Crown Hotel to the Cowgate and you come to
Bannerman's, a superbly atmospheric cellar bar which looks as if it
would survive an earthquake.
Back up on the High Street, just up the hill from the Fringe Office,
is a bar that sums up a lot of what the city is about. Deacon Brodie's
was named after the eighteenth-century figure, a respectable councillor
by day and burglar by night who was eventually hanged on a gallows of
his own devising. People need constantly to be reminded that Edinburgh
has its dark side. Irvine Welsh has done us no disservice by continuing
that tradition, but he's still a Hibs supporter.

* GREEN-FINGERED houseplant-owners all over Britain are being
astonished to find their yucca plants bursting into flower. The recent
heatwave has seen sprays of beautiful striking flowers appearing,
shocking unsuspecting owners.
Yucca plants have rocketed in popularity over the past 20 years and
now sit in the corner of many offices and living rooms; but the trees,
originally from Central and Northern America, rarely flower in this
country unless they are treated properly and well established.
Now the sweltering heat of the summer has meant more of the plants are
bursting into a bloom of colour than ever before. They enjoy the
extremely hot weather and are not too fussy about how often they are
watered.
At Kew Gardens, home of the Royal Botanical Society, giant yuccas
stand proud in the Princess of Wales Conservatory.
''Ours flower every year, but that is not always the case with the
common yuccas,'' says a spokesman. ''If they are outside, in the right
place and well established, then they do tend to flower.
''But inside a lot are not looked after properly and they are
notorious for not flowering for years. Because of the heat -- July was
the third hottest on record and August has started out the same -- more
and more of them are flowering everywhere.''

William Russell is pleased to report that rumours of the death of the
British film industry are greatly exaggerated.
IT may be dead, but it won't lie down. The British film industry, that
is, not the Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival which is very much alive,
kicking, and rarin' to go on August 13. The new management -- director
Mark Cousins and producer Ginnie Atkinson -- has opted to launch New
British Expo as one of the Festival's attractions at which a
comprehensive programme of British films made in the past year will be
shown, issues like how to market British films internationally will be
debated, and producers encouraged in the art of making a pitch for the
cash.
Some of those taking part should be heeded; others are responsible for
those reports of the industry's demise because of the films they have
been responsible for. It should be a stimulating event, and luckily
there are plenty of British films around, the death of the industry
having been prematurely celebrated.
The Festival opens and closes with two eagerly awaited films. The
opening gala is devoted to one of Edinburgh's most loyal supporters, Ken
Loach, whose latest film, Land and Freedom, scandalously ignored by the
Cannes jury, is a powerful drama set during the Spanish Civil War. It is
a European co-production with an international cast led by Ian Hart, and
is an object lesson in how it is done. It would not be a Loach film
without a political agenda, but it also works as a moving love story,
and on several other levels.
The closing film is Funny Bones, directed by Peter Chelsom, who had an
unexpected hit with his first feature, a fantasy about the Irish tenor,
Josef Locke, Hear My Song. This one is about people who are funny
naturally, funny when given a script, and not funny at all no matter how
hard they try. A black comedy, it stars Jerry Lewis as a naturally funny
comedian, Lee Evans as his naturally funny son, and Oliver Platt as his
naturally unfunny son. The comedy is fine, but Chelsom the writer
reveals himself weak on plot with a denouement which is a straight rerun
of his previous film.
The mid-Festival gala film will be Carrington, directed by Christopher
Hampton, which is about the peculiar relationship between the homosexual
historian, Lytton Strachey, and the heterosexual painter, Dora
Carrington, played by Emma Thompson. Jonathan Price won the best actor
prize at Cannes for his performance as Strachey, and the film is the
kind foreigners adore because its picture of England is the England they
imagine still exists, all white flannels, golden summers, and refugees
from James Ivory movies.
This year's big retrospective is devoted to Stanley Donen. Sadly the
great man could not attend, since he is making a new film, Love Letters
-- his first since a Michael Caine turkey called Leave it to Rio in 1984
-- based on a terrible play Hollywood stars like to do in dinner
theatres because it consists of two people reading letters to each
other. No lines to learn. One can only hope the film proves reason
enough for his absence.
The retrospective, even without him, is well worth catching, although
wisely they have left Rio out of it. The great musicals are there in all
their glory -- On the Town, Singin' in the Rain, Seven Brides for Seven
Brothers, It's Always Fair Weather, Funny Face, The Pajama Game, and
Damn Yankees, as well as the quintessential Audrey Hepburn romantic
thriller, Charade, and a rarity, Staircase, notable for the gruesome
miscasting of Rex Harrison and Richard Burton as two gay hairdressers
who yack about love and life across the scissors.
Steve Martin is one of the visiting Americans, there to present his
film, A Simple Twist of Fate, directed by Gillies MacKinnon. A reworking
of Silas Marner set in middle America, it is a heartwarming affair, but
the nineteenth-century plot mechanics do not cross the years well and
Martin's decision to dye his white hair ginger gives him a distinctly
creepy appearance, a sad mistake for a single man allowed to adopt an
orphan baby girl, making him look more like child molester than child
rescuer.
The Irish actor, Gabriel Byrne, plays the child's father and is also
expected in town, as are Adrian Dunbar, Brian Cox, Robert Carlyle,
Robert Towne, Dianne Ladd, Antonia Byrd, Nikita Mikhalkov, and that
great British star, now a hard-working theatre actress, Sylvia Sims.
British films on show range from Chris Newby's Madagascar Skin, a gay
drama set in Wales starring wee Franky Drinkall, alias East Kilbride's
John Hannah, as a boy with a birthmark who finds true love with Bernard
Hill, and Three Steps to Heaven, a swinging London thriller about sex
and corruption in which Katrin Cartlidge shows exactly why she should
have kept her clothes on. Some folk, like Mark Cousins, consider it a
triumph, others, like me, evidence that one reason the British film
industry is in such a dire state is because the BFI makes films like
this.
Terence Davies's The Neon Bible, which stars Gena Rowlands as an
over-the-hill jazz singer, was most unfairly booed at Cannes -- there
were many more boo-worthy movies around -- and it will be interesting to
see whether Edinburgh gives it a warmer reception. It is a typical
Davies tale about small boy surrounded by women whose father is a
bullying drunk and who, to a background of vintage tunes, amid stylised
sets, dreams of escape, if not to happiness at least to better things.
This year the Festival is taking place all over town, with all of
Edinburgh's six cinemas being used, and the cream of the crop being
dispatched to Glasgow Film Theatre -- what you might call a special Out
of Edinburgh week. It is a bold attempt to take the Festival to the
masses, because audiences, although they have been steadily rising, tend
to be drawn from film buffs and the usual Filmhouse/Cameo suspects.
It may even bring in a few tourists, because the crossover between the
Film Festival and the other Festival is small. Art should know no
boundaries.
* The Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival runs from Sunday, August 13, to
Sunday, August 27.

KEN LOACH is well aware that his view of the Spanish Civil War is
going to upset many people on the Left because the film script for Land
And Freedom by Jim Allen, with whom he has worked many times, blames the
communists for its failure. Trotskyite revisionism is the Stalinist
charge. It is a good row, one which will keep the comrades chewing the
fat for months to come, although the rest of the world may be somewhat
bemused at the fierce passions Loach has aroused.
It all happened a long time ago. The war, which lasted from 1936-39,
is today a forgotten war. Why, therefore, make such a film in this day
and age?
Loach has an answer. ''Because it is one of the best stories of the
twentieth century,'' he said. ''It was a time when there was mass
unemployment in Britain, as there is now, when fascism was strong in
Europe, as it is now. It is a very contemporary story. The central issue
is that the Spanish Civil War was the beginning of a revolution in which
factory workers took over the factories, people worked the land,
collectivised the land, and asked themselves the biggest question which
confronts people now -- how do we control our resources?
''That is the central question facing people today, democratic control
of resources, labour and capital. They asked it in Spain in the thirties
and they answered it, or they were beginning to find the answers. It is
important to celebrate that, to put that question on our agenda too, but
it is also important to show how it failed.''
It is the way he does this that has caused the controversy. ''The
revolution was destroyed on the instructions of Stalin,'' he said. ''The
Communist Party was in a position of strength, although numerically
small, because it was the conduits for weapons. The only place you could
get arms was from Russia, conditions which were designed to give the
Communist Party a leading role.
''Stalin believed that if revolutions in other countries endangered
the Soviet Union he would betray them. It was the Communists who put the
landlords back in power over the peasants. That is the quintessence of a
counter-revolutionary act. The workers lost the war because of the
non-intervention of Britain, France, and the other Western powers who
had investments in Spain, and thought a Republican government might take
them over, while they knew the fascists would defend their right to keep
them. That is particularly ironic given the VE celebrations we had
earlier this year where the West was shown as great anti-fascists, yet
three years before that it chose to support them in Spain rather than
the democratically-elected government. The rewriting of history takes
your breath away.''
That is Loach's view. It is not shared by everyone on the left, where
the counter-argument is that Loach and Allen have also done more than
their fair share of rewriting history.
But the film has been a success in Spain, where it opened earlier this
year. On the surface the film works well taken as a straightforward tale
about a young unemployed working-class Liverpool communist, played by
Ian Hart, who goes to war seeking adventure and the brotherhood of man,
falls in love with Blanca, a young Spanish anarchist, and, after her
death, returns home to resume his old life leaving behind a past his
family know nothing about. After his death more than 50 years later his
granddaughter, going through his things, discovers this romantic episode
in the old man's past.
Loach gave his multinational cast -- the story focuses round a group
of 16 militiamen and women -- about 10 days of military training during
the rehearsals, and ensured they talked to people who had lived through
the Spanish Civil War.
He and Allen started writing the Land and Freedom script in 1989, but
it took time to raise the money -- #2.5m. -- given the subject. It is
not big money by other film-makers' standards, but it is Loach's most
expensive film.
Making it was complicated by the fact that it requires subtitles --
the Spanish characters speak Spanish to one another as they would in
real life.

Warm tones and primary colours are brightening up British homes, says
Tracy Peet
* SOUTHERN-EUROPEAN styles are very much in vogue in home interiors,
thanks to the influnce of foreign travel. The vivid colours associated
with bright sunshine, the softer tones of warm landscapes and the
natural shades of sandy beaches are reflected in our choice of schemes
for our homes.
Although the sun doesn't shine so brightly over here, light and airy
window fittings and warm-tone terracotta tiles can still look good.
They're practical, durable, and can shrug off abuse far better than
fabrics.
Whether they're used inside a conservatory or in the house, terracotta
tiles give a warm, homely glow to most interiors, with colours ranging
from pale sand to rich red-brown. Terracotta's popularity has risen
recently, and the subsequent increase in suppliers has meant lower
prices thanks to greater competition.
Tiles can be laid on almost any floor, usually over a layer of
plywood, but beware of rising damp. It will infiltrate the pores of the
tiles and cause salts to rise to the surface, giving an effect similar
to the marks on clay plant pots.
Scotland may lack the climate of southern Europe, but a tiled floor
needn't mean a chilly room. Carpets are cosier, but they generally need
replacing every few years. Terracotta is warmer to the touch than glazed
tiles or lino, and has the advantage of lasting almost forever and even
improving with age.
Before you decide to invest in a terracotta floor, consider the final
appearance. They look best in older houses, particularly those with lots
of wood, so if your home is modern and pristine you may prefer the more
polished look of ceramic tiles.
As a rough guide to prices, the most common 12in-square tiles cost
about #20 a yard. There are plenty of stockists of new tiles around the
country, but for something a bit different, Paris Ceramics sources
antique floors from France, some dating back to the seventeenth century.
Parrefeuilles, for example, are creamy-pink tiles originally used under
the eaves of barns. Alternatively, the Santa Rufina range is still
produced in Spain using methods introduced by the Moors. A less drastic
way to cast a southern glow on your home is with a change in window
fittings. During the summer, when curtains aren't needed to shut out
draughts, blinds and shutters can offer a softer, lighter touch.
Sunway's Roman blind, from the Woodweave Collection, ensures privacy but
allows in light -- even when closed. It has a natural simplicity of
style and comes in a selection of finishes from natural wood to ivy
green, cornflour blue and buttercup yellow. Roman blinds are made to
order, with prices starting at #58 for 60x80cm, and roller blinds are
also available.
Venetian blinds have come a long way from the dull, office blind look
of the seventies. Sunway has softened the style considerably with
delicate finishes, including natural wood tones, the soft yellow of
maize and the blue-on-white patterning of Filigree. Venetian blinds cost
from #76 for a 2x2ft blind.
Epsilon, IKEA's venetian blind, comes in green, cherry and natural
lime wood, and costs from #39 for an 80x175cm blind up to #49 for
120x175cm.
If you prefer fabric blinds, Sunway has teamed up with textile houses
Dovedale and Hill &amp; Knowles, and conjures up some very stylish
combinations. Claudette is a simple blue and white stripe at #55 for a
2x3ft roller blind. It would suit a Mediterranean colour scheme of
painted walls in sunshine colours.

* AWARDS abound at the Festival -- but there's nothing quite like the
Herald Angels. These imposing gilded statuettes will be awarded for the
first time this year to the individuals, groups or even venues which
most impress our regular writers and reviewers. And there's also
something for those upon whom fortune does not smile so favourably -- a
mischievous Little Devil.  Both were designed by sculptor Allan Ross and
will be presented weekly during the Festival.

THE Isle of Lewis Chess Festival (24-28 July) not only promised to be
the event of the year in Scotland, it proved to be just that. More than
230 players competed from all over Scotland and further afield. Four
top-class grandmasters battled in a special invitation grandmaster
tournament.
Many players brought spouses and families on holiday to the island, to
the great delight of the Western Isles Tourist Board. Chess brought more
people to Lewis than any other sporting event or other attraction has
done or is likely to do this year. That includes the island's renowned
sea angling competition and open golf championship. I was there, too,
and it was a great occasion.
The grandmasters played in Stornoway's newly restored Nan Eilan
museum, which also housed an exhibition of the famous Lewis chessmen, on
loan from the British Museum for four months this year. The chessmen are
every bit as mysterious and intriguing as their reputation and could not
fail to inspire a competitive edge in all who saw them. They were
splendidly exhibited with excellent on-line computer information about
their origins and importance in the ancient Norse world to which they
belonged.
In the grandmaster tournament, which attracted considerable coverage
on Grampian television as well as in the national press, 19-year-old
Judit Polgar (Hungary), won convincingly with 5/6, ahead of Simen
Agdestein (Norway) 3[1/2], Nigel Short (England) 2 and Paul Motwani
(Scotland) 1[1/2]. In the Scottish Co-op Open Championship, Mark Hebden
won with 5[1/2]/6. Among other prize-winners, Mark Marshall took the
Western Isles prize for his score of 4/6 in the Minor championship.
Many thanks must go to the organising Lewis Chess Club and the
sponsors -- Western Isles Island Council, Western Isles Enterprise,
Western Isles Tourist Board, the Gannochy Trust, Scottish Co-op, the
Bank of Scotland and Scotia Pharmaceuticals -- who hope to establish the
festival annually. Here is one of the best games from the grandmaster
tournament.
White: S. Agdestein
Black: N. Short
Stornoway 1995
Queen's Gambit Declined
1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nf3 d5 4 Nc3 Be7 5 Bf4 0-0 6 e3 c5 7 dxc5 Bxc5 8 a3
Nc6 9 Qc2 Qa5 10 0-0-0 Be7 11 h4!
Poor Short has to face Kasparov. The PCA world champion introduced
this move in a game against Vaganian in Novgorod two months ago. The
main idea is that after 11 . . . dxc4 12 Bxc4 e5 13 Bg5 is possible.
After the old 11 g4, the same line would leave White's g-pawn under
attack.
11 . . . Rd8 12 Nd2
Agdestein tries to improve on a second game at Novgorod,
Kasparov-Ehlvest, which continued 11 g4 and was eventually drawn.
12 . . . Rd7?!
Short reacts with a rather ungainly and probably suspect plan, whose
main problem is that it fails to develop his queenside while White
develops kingside pressure.
13 Bd3 Qd8 14 cxd5 exd5 15 Nf3 Qf8 16 g4!
White can safely play this aggressive move because of his pressure on
h7. While White's kingside attack is moving into gear, Black is still
far from establishing counter-balancing queenside play.
16 . . . Ne4 17 Ne5 Nxe5 18 Bxe5 f6 19 Bd4 Rc7 20 f3!
Just as Black's pieces are beginning to line up against White's king,
Agdestein demonstrates that White's attack is stronger following a long
combinational line introduced by this fine pawn move.
20 . . . Nxc3 21 Bxh7+ Kh8 22 Bxc3 Bxa3 23 Rxd5!
Not 23 bxa3 Qxa3+ 24 Kd2 Bxg4 25 fxg4 Rac8 and Black has a real
attack. But now 24 Rh5 is a deadly threat and Black can only sacrifice
his queen's bishop under disadvantageous circumstances.
23 . . . Bxg4 24 fxg4 Rxc3 25 Qxc3 Rc8 26 Qxc8 Qxc8+ 27 Bc2
And if 27 . . . Qc3 28 Rd8+ and mates. Black now has to go completely
on to the defensive and is defenceless against the combined fire-power
of White's two rooks and king's bishop.
27 . . . Be7 28 Rhd1 Kg8 29 Rd7 Kf8 30 Kb1 a5 31 h5 Qc6 32 Bf5 a4 33
Rc1 Black resigns
Or if Black's queen moves, 34 Rc8+ and wins.

Lesley Duncan strolls down the Royal MIle with a tourist's eye.
TO see oursels as others see us is -- by implication at least in
Burns's poem -- a chastening experience. But Scottish morale, and that
of the denizens of Edinburgh in particular, gets a major boost from a
trip down the Royal Mile in the company of a volunteer guide such as
Herbert Suslak.
Mr Suslak -- a sprightly senior citizen ''in advertising'' -- came to
Edinburgh from London 20 years ago and ''fell in love with the place''.
His European origins show in his accent and his talent for lecturing
tourists in German. His knowledge of Scottish cultural history and the
country's Continental links puts a mere native to shame. His fellow
guides, he told me, range from the quite young to ''geriatrics like
myself!'' They don't learn set speeches and each has his or her own
slant on historic Edinburgh.
We met at Cannonball House beside the Castle Esplanade, the place a
bedlam of buses and visitors. Bagpipers beset us. Taking refuge under
one of the Tattoo stands -- ''Mind your head on the Meccano set,'' he
warned --Mr Suslak began with the volcano and subsequent ice ages that
gouged out the Forth Valley, leaving the Castle Rock and the spine of
the Royal Mile to gradual habitation.
Queen Margaret, wife of Malcolm Canmore, won his plaudits for
establishing Scotland's enduring continental links -- and even for
bringing in the Normans and feudalism (debatable, that). He also pointed
out how ''all the palace-like places in Edinburgh are schools'' and
praised the merchants who founded them. The Scots educational tradition
has certainly an admirer.
Downwards into the melee. The leitmotif of Herbert Suslak's discourse
was how the geographical limitations of the Royal Mile affected its
housing (the first skyscrapers in the world were its wooden, fire-prone
buildings, 10 to 14 storeys high) and its social mix (law lords and
gentry brushed shoulders with street-sweepers on the turnpike stairs,
making Edinburgh the ''most democratic town there had ever been, up
until the eighteenth century''). All this in a welter of sewage that
attracted the ironic sobriquet ''the flowers of Edinburgh''. The
accompanying ''gardyloo'' rite needs no explanation to Scots -- no doubt
it causes fastidious shudders in others.
Before we started darting up closes, my guide drew attention to the
little memorial to the 300 or so witches executed in Edinburgh over the
centuries of that disgusting persecution. Even here, he was willing to
give Scotland credit for being less appalling in its treatment of them
than other countries. Only a few decades separated the end of
witch-hunting from the Enlightenment. Not a comfortable thought.
The tirling-pin in Cannonball House provided a diversion. Two giggling
Asian students watched us pull the bent nail up and down the handle --
the polite alternative to knocking at the door.
The austerity of the Calvinist building tradition is another theme for
Herbert Suslak. In Milne's Court, he pointed out the first open square
and the first building built on infrastructure on the side of the old
town's spine.
The small windows, glazed on top with wooden shutters below, are a
traditional feature here, as in Gladstone's Land, the
seventeenth-century house owned by the National Trust for Scotland.
There probably weren't rowan trees in James Court when Boswell lived
there and David Hume was visited by the philosopher Rousseau.
But it's people who haunt the Royal Mile. Take Lady Stair, the
aristocratic battered wife who was forced into her second marriage by a
doting suitor's appearance in nightgarb at her window; Deacon Brodie who
combined cabinet-making with robbery and designed his own scaffold; the
six-foot-high Countess of Eglinton who with her eight plumed daughters
graced the assemblies which ''were the discos of their day''; Bailie
McMorrin who found fame in 1595 by being shot dead by a rioting
schoolboy.
All this without the detour via the chaussee stones beside St Giles'
into Parliament House. Here wigged lawyers pace the parquet floor in
predetermined lines under a roof of Baltic splendour while, outside,
Charles II bestrides his lead horse which threatened to buckle into a
dachshund last century when the interior filled with water. Over in
Anchor Close lived a William Smellie who printed the first edition of
the Encyclopaedia Britannica, while across the road a Dr Hutton was
laying the basis for modern geology with his 1785 tome, The Theory of
the Earth.
Sticking out into the street, John Knox's House has a Tudor air --
maybe with a bit of poetic justice since the man spent time at the
English court. And, yes, I did know that Knox's ''monstrous regiment of
women'' was not a military allusion but referred to the regimens of
Bloody Mary and her half sister.
Perhaps Paisley Close sums up the mixture of mortar and humanity that
makes the Royal Mile so fascinating. It's also known as ''Heave awa''
Close after the original building there collapsed in the 1860s. Days
after the event, a boy's voice piped up from the rubble saying, ''Heave
awa' chaps, A'm no deid yet!''  A certain Mr Fettes, a greengrocer, once
lived in that close.
The Royal Mile walk may be downhill all the way but it's certainly
uplifting educationally.
* Free walking tours of the Royal Mile -- lasting approximately two
hours -- run throughout the Festival, starting from Cannonball House
beside the Castle Esplanade every 10 minutes between 10am and 11am and
2pm and 3pm; Sundays between 2pm and 3pm only.

* ONCE Richard Demarco decided to venture as far as Dundee School of
Art for one of his exhibitions, it was certain that others would follow
in their search for pastures new.
Demarco's Festival Summer School, or ''university under a tree'', for
so many years carried out on a ship as it sailed its way to Edinburgh,
this year travels via 30 different gardens scattered from Goodwood to
Brussels, Lulworth to Yorkshire, Traquair to Pitmedden. Telephone 0131
557 0707 to join them on the next few days.
Other out-of-town galleries include a couple at Haddington: the Peter
Potter which shows Hebridean Harmonies of Harris by Mackenzie and Fiona
MacIntyre, and The Sands Gallery with paintings by Russians from the
Ukraine and from Rostov-on-Don.
The Norrie Toch Studios in Gullane are a great space, and they mount
ambitious, lively exhibitions. Now joining with the Italian Cultural
Institute to present photo work by Carlo Maria Causati. Nearby in
Stenton, the Macaulay Gallery shows work by new graduates from the
Scottish art colleges.
In the other direction the Line Gallery at Linlithgow is selling
Danish applied arts in parallel with the Danish Festival show at
Edinburgh City Art Centre.
In Edinburgh itself less well-known spaces include the Adam Pottery in
Henderson Row, and Wasps Studios off Hamilton Place.

To you, it may be a pavement, but explains Mark Fisher, to some, it's
a performance space.
IF THEY ever get someone to write an official song for the Edinburgh
Festival, its chorus will go: ''Wherever I lay my hat, that's my
venue.'' For the Scottish capital has an uncanny knack of producing
theatre spaces out of nowhere. And when no physical space is available,
Fringe companies simply invent one.
Richard Demarco, not content with stuffing performances and
exhibitions into every corner of an abandoned school in the New Town,
has annexed a chunk of Tayside and, with a unilateral pincer movement,
declared that Dundee Rep is part of the Fringe too. And in case there's
any doubt about it, he's arranging performances for Fringegoers on the
northbound train.
All of which makes a certain Dr Neil's proposal to turn his garden
into a venue sound relatively commonplace. His award-winning grounds on
the edge of Duddingston Loch will be open to the public on the
afternoons of Aug 19 and 20, when you'll discover celebrities from The
Beechgrove Garden lingering among the rose bushes ready to give you
advice.
Odd perhaps, but is it art? And where, for that matter, does the
boundary lie between art and commerce? This year you can shop, drink and
eat while listening to folk-songs at Valvona &amp; Crolla, rhythm and blues
at Fat Sams, wartime reminiscences at Fingers Piano Bar, a one-woman
revue at C C Blooms, some Sondheim at the Sheraton, and Bangladeshi food
at the Raj. All in the name of the Fringe.
This year there's also the first gay and lesbian venue, called the
Blue Fest, in the former Calton Studios which, in addition to the
already announced programme, has slotted in a revival of Cat A Theatre
Company's tough Mayfest prison drama, Doing Bird, and a new production
of Are there Tigers in the Congo?, first seen at the Traverse in 1991,
by Oxygen House. ''We have created a venue which gives all gay artists,
whether well-established or just starting out, a chance to perform at
the 1995 Fringe,'' says co-director Siobhain Jamieson.
Creating new venues is not the exclusive province of the Fringe,
however. The Edinburgh International Festival loves to do it too. ''It's
a real tradition of the Edinburgh Festival to find the least likely
place and put on a show,'' says Nick Dodds, administrative manager of
the Edinburgh International Film Festival. This year's find is the Drill
Hall on Forrest Road, an unglamorous building once used by the Officer
Training Corps and now in operation as a car-park for the university's
stores department.
''It's a car-park with a roof on it,'' says Dodds whose team will be
installing two seating banks to cater for 350 people, plus a few mobile
toilets and a handful of fire exits.
The Drill Hall been called into action by French director Patrice
Chereau who asked the Fesitval organisers to come up with a venue that
had no associations. His production of Dans la Solitude des Champs Coton
(In the Loneliness of the Cotton Fields) by Bernard-Marie Koltes is
about a dealer and a client who meet in a street at dusk for an
anonymous transaction. ''He wanted a neutral space,'' explains Dodds.
''He didn't want people coming in and immediately thinking it was a
theatre or an ice-rink or whatever.''
This turned out to be an unexpectedly tall order and it was only a
chance diversion at the end of a fruitless day searching Edinburgh's
more obscure corners that revealed just the place Chereau had in mind.
The glass roof of this small unpretentious building will enable the
director to put on his production virtually entirely in natural light,
the performances having been scheduled precisely to start in daylight
and finish after dark.
Compared to covering over an ice-rink last year, or refitting a sports
hall with a week's notice after a fire knocked the Playhouse out of
action in 1993, getting the Drill Hall ready should be plain sailing for
the Festival's technical crew.
The people at Regular Music like to set themselves a bit of a
challenge too. For the past couple of years they've run a popular site
called the Acropolis in a tent on top of Calton Hill, but this time they
felt the need for a change. Down at the bottom of Broughton Place, a
residential road off Broughton Street, they discovered a deconsecrated
church that was on the property market. Rechristening it the Palladium,
they took out a lease for the duration of the Fringe and programmed a
considerably more cacophonous line-up than older parishioners will
remember.
''We like to do different things,'' says Regular's Gael Ramage.
''Broughton is the 'in' area of Edinburgh. It's young and funky and it's
taking over from Stockbridge in that respect.''
It's not all sacrilege, however. Admittedly they're hoping to put up a
neon sign on the colonnaded front, but they'll be keeping most of the
original pews, and the stage, in time-honoured fashion, will be where
the pulpit should be. The walls are so thick they don't expect noise
pollution to be a problem and the bare paving stones and shaded interior
will ensure that the Palladium is one of the city's coolest venues.
As well as the already announced performances by Club Swing (sexy
Aussie trapeze artists), the Tokyo Shock Boys (kamikaze novelty
stuntmen), and the Tap Dogs (camp dancers from down under), there'll be
additional helpings of profanity and pop culture courtesy of Corky and
the Juice Pigs, Hue and Cry and Horse.
With so many people looking for so many new venues every year, you'd
think the supply of daft places would be drying up. But it seems not.
Already the Fringe Office has received a call from someone who has a yet
more bizarre venue to rent out for 1996. It's an industrial quarry.

Saturation coverage or a diserning selection procedure - however you
handle your Festival campaign, Thom Dibdin has some handy hints to make
life that bit easier.
ANY fool can have an awful time in Edinburgh during the Festival. It
takes a well-prepared fool to cope with the severe cultural overload,
the prolonged exposure to antediluvian seating methods, the frantic
races across the city to catch the latest nominees for the Perrier Award
-- only to find that they are medical students -- and the crowds that
subscribe to the Continental queueing theory, and still want to come
back for more.
In fact, the largest arts festival on earth is such a health hazard
that were it set in America it would be the subject of several cases of
litigation. Thankfully this is not the case. Fringe-goers continue to
rely on preparation for their wellbeing.
There are only two ways to attend the Festivals. Either ration
yourself to one show, screening, or talk a day, or blitz the city in a
full-on orgy of cultural hedonism. The former form of deferred
gratification is only for those of a highly sensible disposition. Those
who do not live in Edinburgh should remember that the last train for
Glasgow leaves Waverley Station at 11.30pm (12.30am on Saturday night).
Blitzing is by far the most appealing approach. With careful perusal
of the various programmes, taking into account travel times between
venues, the queueing factor, and the complications of alcohol abuse, you
will be able to sleep, eat, breathe, and generally live the Festival
until you fall over or run out of money. And even then you should still
be able to keep going. It is best to avoid the last weekend of the
Festival which is the English bank holiday. If you must attend at this
time, buy your tickets well in advance. If you are unable to confine
your viewing habits to one part of Edinburgh then make sure that your
travel arrangements are well-organised. Leave your car at home or
park-and-ride from the edge of town. Even if you are able to drive into
the centre, then you won't be able to park. Bus maps are available from
the Travel Centre in St Giles' Street, and the Fringe Office has
arranged for a one-week bus pass for #9.
Walking, with the occasional taxi, is a viable option. Do not, however
allow a cab in which you are a passenger to pass near the top of the
High Street, the Castle, or George IV Bridge within half an hour of the
beginning or end of the Tattoo. The roads become so blocked that taxi
costs can rise to five minutes and pounds per 100 yards. In the centre
of town your walking speed will be cut in half by meandering tourists
and thrusting leafleters.
By far the best bet is to beg, borrow or hire a bicycle. Make sure
that both it and you can cope with quite strenuous hills and
cobblestones. It is the quickest and most efficient way of getting
around. Expect to pay #10 a day for five days' hire or more.
Once at your venue, you will notice the seats. These appear to have
improved over the years. Where seating was once designed in the style of
Tomas de Torquemada, it is now created to the specifications of the
Marquis de Sade: It is as uncomfortable as it ever was. It's just a bit
more fun. This is an illusion caused by a strongly accelerated
application of Darwin's theories to the buttocks of the average
festival-goer. Be prepared and take a cushion. Strapping a Lilo on to
your back is considered excessive but will provide some shelter when it
rains which it invariably will. So pack a mac.
The Festival army like any other marches on its stomach. You should be
able to get by on alcohol and adrenalin for a few days but there will
come a time when you need to eat. The Fringe Club provides a solid meal
of the student union variety. Most venues provide some sort of cafe.
Generally, in a bizarre form of instant karma the quality of the food
will be inversely proportional to the quality of the seats.
If you have problems finding time to eat then choose one of the
several shows which offer free food as an inducement for your patronage.
This does not necessarily mean that the performance will be dire.
Alternatively book yourself a table at a restaurant, pretend it is a
Fringe venue, and review the service. It will undoubtedly be better
acted and with a tastier denoument than the last show you saw. It might
even be cheaper.
Your chief enemy in the blitz is sleep. The best espressos and better
ristrettos are to be had in the Elephant House on George IV Bridge. A
single should stir even the catatonic from their slumber while a double
dose should jolt them into top gear.
If you have been feeding your head so hard that you have neglected
your stomach Dario's on Lothian Road is open until 6am every day. Last
orders is at 5am. Cafe Florentine, just off the High Street in St Giles'
Street, has applied for an all-night licence but should at any rate be
open for extended hours. It is the ideal place to chill and chat over a
chocolate cake which, although highly priced, will be worth every penny.
The Blue Moon Cafe on Broughton Street is friendly and serves good,
moderately priced, food although it disgraces itself somewhat by closing
at 3am and opening at 9am during the week -- 5am over the weekend.
The most common ailment directly related to the festival starts in the
wallet and quickly spreads to both your bank and credit-card accounts.
Without a serious injection of readies it is likely to lead to solo
performances in front of your bank manager.
The best way round this problem is to recognise that you don't
actually have to go to any performances at all. All you really need is
to be able to lord it over everyone else when you get home. A working
knowledge of the shows is easily gleaned from the papers and from around
the bars. You should also take the time to research a few juicy items of
gossip. For maximum effect these should not be plausible.
If you must see something, besides appearing at the venue advertised
in the Fringe brochure any self-respecting show will put on a free
''taster'' at either the Mound, the queue outside the Fringe Office,
Fringe Sunday, or the Fringe Club. Try not to get suckered into watching
the fire-eaters, magicians, or snake-dancers. These are not bona fide
Fringe artistes but are outrageously good and you will feel compelled to
give them a donation.
Entry to the Fringe Club is free during the day or you can buy a
season ticket for #20 (#5 a day). It is a good place to find out what is
worth seeing. But don't believe a word of anything that anyone tells you
about a play, whether they are a professional critic or bar fly, until
you have assessed their taste against some commonly viewed show.
If you can't stand the heat of the Festival then do not enter the
kitchen. Late holidays in Romania are cheap at the moment. Go there with
your portable computer and modem. Log on to the Internet and surf
through the Fringe's own worldwide web site.

IT USED to be the case at the Edinburgh Jazz Festival that you spent
the week jumping from one gig to another in crosstown treks, chasing
your favourite musicians.
Well, as Duke Ellington once observed in a song title -- Things Ain't
What They Used to Be.
Mike Hart's festival is smaller now than it was in its glory days.
There are fewer star musicians from the States than there once were.
Yet Hart has been able to keep the flame of traditional and mainstream
music alive -- and still attract some top-level names to the city
despite the cutbacks he has suffered in sponsorship cash.
Though there may not be as many musicians as before, he has retained
quality. That extraordinary pianist Dick Hyman, taking a break from
doing movie scores for Woody Allen films, will be seen and heard in
various settings on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
On Monday afternoon, for example, he will provide a history of jazz
piano in a solo setting. I have seen Hyman give a similar recital before
and it is uncanny how well he can adapt to illustrate the playing of so
many disparate stylists while allowing glimpses of his own Tatum-touched
wizardry to break through.
Hyman will take his listeners from ragtime through stride piano and on
to the most modern playing.
Only recently a CD was released which put together two of his
re-creation albums, one devoted to the music of Jelly Roll Morton and
the other focusing on James P Johnson.
Doubtless, both these giants will have roles to play in the Hyman
history before he changes over to organ for a recital in St Giles'
Cathedral that evening.
Hyman is with various groups on Tuesday and then joins the Festival
headliners Summit Reunion at the gala concert on Wednesday night.
Hart has done well to lure Hyman from his Florida home once more, and
also in persuading the star-studded Summit Reunion to appear. Only
veteran bass player Milt Hinton is missing from the usual line-up.
The gala affair is billed as the highlight of the week and Hart has
packed the bill with top names.
But there are other events which, for me, will be equally rewarding.
On Tuesday, George Melly forsakes his own vocalising to lecture on the
work of blues singer Bessie Smith.
The Empress of the Blues has long been a passion for Melly and his
talk, illustrated with records, should be memorable.
Then there are several appearances from the underrated Australian
trumpeter Bob Barnard scheduled throughout the week. Barnard deserves
this kind of exposure. He plays superbly on a new CD which teams him
with pianist Ralph Sutton and on the evidence of that he will more than
hold his own in a trumpet battle which is set for Tuesday night.
A little earlier that same day British trombonists Roy Williams and
Pete Strange pay tribute to Jay and Kai -- J J Johnson and Kai Winding,
the legendary trombone team of the 1950s.
There are other tributes, too, studded through the programme, Martin
Taylor pays homage to Django Reinhardt; Rosemary Squires, Maxine
Daniels, and Barbara Jay salute Ella Fitzgerald; and Bruce Adams and
Alan Barnes will play the music of Charlie Parker.
Oh, and I can't forget that singer-guitarist-raconteur Marti Grosz
will appear on Tuesday and Wednesday.
So, while the Jazz Festival may not have the drawing power of before
it remains a week which is lovingly and carefully put together. There
are fewer of the giants on parade. We must simply content ourselves with
memories of Buddy Tate, Carl Fontana, Doc Cheatham, Yank Lawson, Teddy
Wilson, Jay McShann, and all those others who have visited this event.
Hart, despite the cash problems he has had to contend with over the
past few years, in common with many other such events, still relies on
presenting tasteful, swinging music played in the main by musicians
whose work can cut across stylistic barriers.
When you go to Edinburgh for the Festival, then you know you will
always find moments of musical magic, moments which will touch your
heart.

LOCK up your mothers. The Hot Antic Jazz Band is back in town. These
six Provencal purveyors of long-neglected tunes from the heyday of the
small jazz group are bound to convert even the most reluctant of jazz
agnostics into festival trailblazers. They certainly helped my
conversion along when I came across them during my first jazz festival
in 1986.
By that time the Hot Antics were already established as festival
favourites, having won BBC Radio Scotland's title of Best Band for their
second appearance in Edinburgh, in 1983. Music aside, what makes the
Antics so hot with audiences is their collective joie de vivre. That
they simply ooze Gallic charm is just a bonus.
The Hot Antic Jazz Band -- also known as the Hotties, the Antics or
for the more earnest fan, HAJB -- was formed in 1979. From the beginning
the little-remembered trumpeter Cladys ''Jabbo'' Smith was a major
influence on the Hot Antics. Cornettist Michel Bastide, effectively the
band's leader, is an expert on the music of Smith, who -- in the late
1920s -- was one of the more serious trumpeting rivals to Louis
Armstrong. He was also an extremely inventive composer (and rather
suggestive lyricist), and the repertoire of his most celebrated band,
the Rhythm Aces, was packed with Smith originals.
By the late 1980s when they played New York's Carnegie Hall, the
repertoire and instrumentation included work by Bix Beiderbecke, Don
Redman, King Oliver, and Sidney Bechet. And the band was undergoing
various changes in personnel. To this Edinburgh Jazz Festival-lover's
dismay, the Antics were rumoured to have split up at some point after
their 1989 trip here.
They reappeared in 1992. Now they were six: with two relatively
fresh-faced newcomers (Bernard Antherieu and Philippe Raspail), and an
entirely different repertoire. But working the same old magic, with the
same old style. The Hot Antics -- always dapperly dressed in crisp white
shirts, identical trousers and coloured braces -- could pass for
escapees from a 1930s screwball comedy. The personalities and
appearances of three of the pre-1989 members would appear to confirm
this. ''Doc'' Bastide is the resident smoothie, the Cary Grant of the
cornet (he plays valve trombone almost as well) who -- as the most
fluent in English -- does most of the talking and crooning. Pianist
Stephane ''Groucho'' Matthey's playing is as madcap and unpredictable as
the great comedian's gags. Sousaphone player (and occasional trombonist)
Christian Lefevre is the quiet man of the band (but only in comparison
with the others) and, as such, reminds one of Harpo, not least when he
makes rude noises with his horn.
An eclectic bunch, but one which clearly relishes every opportunity to
make music and entertain together. These are jazz enthusiasts in the
truest sense: during their first Edinburgh week after their re-forming
-- and with only a limited number of tunes to their repertoire -- they
volunteered to take on all the gigs which another band was suddenly
unable to fulfil, as well as their own existing commitments. Needless to
say, they pulled it off with characterstic panache. But then what would
you expect from a band that has more instruments than feet?
* The Hot Antic Jazz Band is playing at various venues, starting today
at 1pm in the Grassmarket's free Mardi Gras event. See Jazz Festival
programme for full details.

Thom Dibdin makes a case for legitmising clubland
JUST when you thought that Edinburgh couldn't get any more hedonistic
during August, the Fringe has discovered clubbing. Or rather, clubbing
has discovered the Fringe.
Thespians and their audiences might be hard-working by day, but come
the strike of midnight they are not about to turn into bed-ridden
bookworms. What is needed is a spot of uninhibited dance-floor action
and from four-to-the-floor house to polyrhythmic world music, almost
every limb-lubricating style is on offer.
You will have to look carefully through the Fringe programme, however,
to find the clubs: filed away under ''Music''. One promoter who believes
that clubbing is ''part and parcel'' of the Festival is Gerry McDonald,
manager of Venue 50: the Music Box (Victoria Street). He contacted the
Fringe Office to ask why they didn't have a section for clubs: ''They
said they didn't think they warrant it,'' he reports. ''I'm sorry, but
that is a dated attitude.''
Although it is one of the few clubs to open all week, it must be said
that Venue 50 is strongly committed to alcohol-fuelled dancing to the
sounds of Indie rock. With a spot of soul thrown in on Tuesdays and funk
on Thursdays. Similarly, the Rocking Horse (Victoria Street) is at its
best on Fridays and Saturdays when the rock gods hold sway .
For a more modern music policy head for La Belle Angele (Venue 147,
Cowgate, Thurs-Sat), the Attic (Cowgate, nightly), the Vaults (Niddry
Street, Thurs-Sun), the Venue (Calton Road, Thurs-Sun), or Blue Fest
(Venue 94, Calton Road, not Monday).
The Vaults has a mainstream house approach with parties up to 1000
strong. Big-name guests to look out include Jon of the Pleased Wimmin
(Thursday 17) and a Mix Mag party on Thursday 31.
Truly dancetastic moments are most likely to be achieved on the
technotronic dance floor of Pure (the Venue, Fridays) which celebrates
five years of hedonism on August 11 and is where Andrew Weatherall
guests on the 23rd. Tribal Funktion (the Venue, Saturday 19 and Saturday
2) is equally renowned for its superbly mixed house.
Saturday nights at La Belle always fill early. And quite justificably
so. Fridays alternate between the dress-as-you-dare Fetish (11th and
25th) with its flirtatious hard house and Big Beat (18th and 1st) where
dance-floor jazz provides the groovers.
Thursdays is home to Squid, on a hip hop tip with guests such as Andy
Smith of Portishead (25th).
Blue Fest kickstarts the festival with Fruit Machine coming up from
Heaven on Friday. Every Saturday, Scotland's largest gay club, Joy, will
continue to prove that Edinburgh throws the best parties. Queen Maxine
joins Maggie and Alan on the 19th. Other delights include Dragged Out,
Babe-tastic (dresses only!), and Queer Sisterhood.
If polyrhythmic partying is your preference, try the Mambo Club of
Edinburgh which is open every night of the festival at Venue 75. Sir
Ossie is guaranteed to please with everything from African to Zouk,
passing through Latin and Reggae. Otherwise, Club Latino returns to the
Assembly Rooms (Venue 3, George Street, Thurs-Sat) with a host of
glittering Latin bands to complement the hot and sweaty DJ action. The
skankingly good rude is at the Attic on Saturdays, the 25th and 2nd.
Cheesy listening is being imported in the form of London's Club Indigo
which alternates between the City Cafe (Blair Street, Fri, Sat) and the
Assembly Rooms. It is doubtful, however, that even Indigo will live up
to the excessive cheesiness of Edinburgh's own Going Places at the MGM
Cinema, Lothian Road, Saturday 12 and Saturday 2.
Whatever your preference, every clubber should head for Venue 116:
Club M8, where Damage Productions are producing a play about clubbing
and club culture in the main hall (7.30pm, not Monday). At nights they
are taking over the top rooms for their own club, while during the day
they are hosting discussions about club culture.
''It makes sense to combine the two energies, of a Fringe venue and a
club venue, says Damage's director John Paul McGroarty. And with a pair
of Technics on hand, video mixing and installed lighting, the venue is
better equipped than any other.
Finally, should you still have not had enough dancing during the
Festival don't forget The Event III. Twenty hours of bouncy hardcore and
techno dance action are promised out at Ingliston from noon on Saturday,
September 2. See you on the dance floor.

Alison Kerr warns of the addictive nature of the Original Soprano
Summit
PARENTS of very small children are advised not to bring them along to
the Edinburgh Jazz Festival's Original Soprano Summit concert, because
they could end up inflicting irreparable damage on them. Because this
band's effect on audiences, apparently, goes beyond even Tom Jones's on
the knicker-waving population. As summit co-leader Kenny Davern
explains: ''People still throw their babies up at this band, at this
combination of instruments.''
Original Soprano Summit is the 1990s version of the phenomenally
successful Soprano Summit band of the 1970s; a band which, despite -- or
possibly because of -- its lamentably short lifetime (six years), became
legendary and whose albums became collectors' items almost as soon as
they were issued. Its conception -- at a ''jazz party'' organised by
enthusiast Dick Gibson over a holiday weekend in September 1972 -- has
become a tale that clarinettist Davern and fellow founding father,
saxophonist and clarinettist Bob Wilber, enjoy telling.
By day three of the party, audiences were suffering from ear fatigue
and Gibson decided that he needed something to wake everyone up.
According to Davern, Gibson turned to Wilber and said in his Alabama
drawl: ''Now, I wan' you and Kinny to get together and play a duet''.
The two, who had rarely performed together, quickly talked through a
head arrangement of Duke Ellington's moody and magnificent The Mooche
for two soprano saxophones -- a combination, amazingly, never before
used in a working jazz band.
''We got a rhythm section together -- by a fluke Dick Hyman, Bucky
Pizzarelli, Bobby Rosengarden, and Milt Hinton were all there -- and we
got up and did the number. We finished it off on two high notes in
thirds and to our amazement people just rose up in applause -- 650 folks
just screaming with delight -- and it was then that we realised that we
had something different.''
In December 1972 the infant Soprano Summit cut its first album, the
only difference in personnel being that busy bassist Hinton was replaced
by George Duvivier. Then, after a second LP, the second incarnation of
Soprano Summit was born.
The main reason for change was an economic one: as a six-piece band,
Soprano Summit was an expensive package. The band also wanted to travel
light, so the piano had to go.
Rhythm guitarist Marty Grosz was signed up to replace Pizzarelli, who
was tied up with studio work. Grosz shared with Wilber and Davern a love
for tunes that were off the beaten standard track. Indeed, Soprano
Summit's basic groundplan was to be different and to make a feature of
the fact that this was a working band with a varied working repertoire.
In Grosz they also had ''a marvellous player who lent the band an
entertainment factor with his singing and clowning''. Davern adds:
''That was the basic sound of the group: two sopranos, or clarinet and
soprano, and the guitar held it together like glue''.
The guitar was the icing on an already rather tasty cake, because the
essence of Soprano Summit was the relationship between its two frontmen.
Davern puts it down to the fact that they grew up on the same music but
both have their own views on how it should be played. ''Our differences
lie in how to approach the godhead, so to speak. We're all descendants
of classic jazz. Bob has his idea of how it should be interpreted and I
have mine. But together, it works.''
In a typical Soprano Summit number they will bounce the melody
backwards and forwards between them like a football, with one taking a
step back to play the obbligato and create a space for the other to lead
the way with a solo. There is always a balance between the arranged and
the spontaneous, although one senses that much of the arranging is going
on as they play. As Wilber says: ''A lot of it is intuitive. We find out
what works by trying it, and then incorporate it into our repertoire.''
Their intuition about one another's direction also means that they
complement each other's playing. Davern observes: ''Sometimes when the
two of us play two notes, you can hear a third note present -- a
harmonic that suddenly appears, a richness.''
Although Soprano Summit split up in 1978, both Wilber and Davern, who
now concentrates on clarinet, discuss their musical rapport in the
present tense because since they got together to record Summit Reunion
(with their original line-up) in 1990, they have increasingly found
themselves being booked together for concerts, albeit with different
rhythm sections. For the Edinburgh Jazz Festival's gala concert,
however, they will be joined by their first choices. As Wilber points
out: ''It's amazing. First time around, we really had to scramble to get
enough gigs to keep going, and now we're in demand all over the place as
a reunion band.'' With Marty Grosz also in attendance at the gala gig,
it could well be that the entire living cast (George Duvivier is dead)
of this seventies supergroup will take the stage together for the first
time.
* Original Soprano Summit will be part of the Edinburgh International
Jazz Festival's Gala Concert on Wednesday, August 9, at 8pm in the
Festival Theatre.

Scottish Amateur
TROON Wellbeck's Hugh McKibbin, aged 21, could today become only the
fourth player -- after Jack McLean, Ronnie Shade, and Charlie Green --
since the event's inauguration in 1922 to win the J &amp; B Scottish Amateur
Championship in successive years.
In the 36-hole final at Southerness, West Linton's Simon Mackenzie,
who is 25, will attempt to thwart that achievement.
In the semi-finals yesterday, again played in brilliant sunshine and a
cooling easterly breeze, McKibbin demolished Alan Turnbull, the other
surviving seed, by 5 and 4, never losing a hole. Despite the
unpredictable bounces of fiery fairways, McKibbin was three under par,
so that in 106 holes over seven games he is approximately two under.
In a more laboured match Mackenzie beat Michael Brooks, the son of
Andrew, the Royal St George's professional by 2 and 1 in two over par.
Mackenzie's figures for 112 holes do not compare for economy with
McKibbin's but the semi-finalist of two years ago has, remarkably, never
been down to any of his seven opponents.
The penultimate matches followed similar patterns. Both eventual
winners were out in 33, two under, for Mackenzie to be four up and
McKibbin two. But the latter forged further ahead, a knock-down
No.6-iron dead at the eleventh. His most telling shot and a No.8-iron
from 180 yards to three feet at the fourteenth the coup de grace.
More than once Mackenzie has seen a lead built before the turn dwindle
alarmingly after it, but although Brooks took the short tenth and
eleventh in par Mackenzie stood more firmly this time. Indeed, the
crucial shot for him was the putt of eight feet he holed to half the
short fifteenth to avoid going back to one up.
Brooks made one last valiant effort to stay in the game when, after he
had mis-hit a chip at the sixteenth, in the manner of Costantino Rocca
at the seventy-second hole in the Open championship, he then holed a 25
feet putt for a 4 up and over a bank. But that proved to be that.
McKibbin has had mixed fortunes since he won at Renfrew but two
experiences in more recent times improved morale. He finished fourth in
the Tennant Cup and playing alongside the professionals, Peter Senior
and Vicente Fernandez, in the Open qualifying competition taught him the
value of not being over-aggressive.
Mackenzie, who was runner-up in the national strokeplay championship
in June, made the point that going one better than at Royal Dornoch was
a real bonus. ''After all, I'm a full-time worker,'' said the assistant
branch manager of a finance company in Edinburgh.
Barclay Howard, at 42, rather ran out of steam in his quarter-final
match against Brooks and later confirmed that after the home
internationals he would retire from full-time competition.

Dundee United 1, Rangers 2
APART from a delay of more than an hour caused by a faulty fire alarm,
there was a further disappointment for the crowd of more than 6000 when
Rangers fielded a depleted side.
Manager Walter Smith clearly had decided that Paul Gascoigne and other
big-name stars had already gained enough pre-season practice ahead of
Rangers' last warm-up match before meeting Famagusta in the European Cup
preliminary-round tie at Ibrox on Wednesday.
The match itself was something of a nightmare for Ally Maxwell on his
Tannadice debut, and against his former club. He lost two goals inside a
minute as United were defeated, and the first was hauntingly reminiscent
of the one he conceded when playing against the Taysiders in the 1994
Scottish Cup final. It was Maxwell's part in that defeat which virtually
ended his Rangers career.
Former United player Gary Bollan created the first opening. He floated
a cross to the far post, where Gordon Durie's header was too high.
Paddy Connolly had United's first chance and it required a fine tackle
by Craig Moore to keep him out. Maxwell was relieved a few minutes later
when a powerful 30-yard effort by Gordan Petric crept just past the same
post.
Delightful skills by Connolly set up a United chance for Robbie
Winters, whose try was well saved by Billy Thomson as the interval
approached.
United moved ahead in 53 minutes after Basile Boli fouled Winters out
on the right. Billy Thomson saved brilliantly when David Hannah headed
in Andy McLaren's free kick. But the Rangers keeper could not hold the
ball and Steven Pressley forced the ball over the line.
Maxwell's night began to turn sour in 62 minutes. He tried to clear a
Pressley pass-back, but the ball cannoned off Gordon Durie and rebounded
into the net.
A minute later Petric scored against his former club with a 25-yard
free kick which beat Maxwell at his left-hand post. United tried to
overcome that double setback and both Winters and Scott Crabbe had
scoring opportunities.
DUNDEE UNITED -- Maxwell, Terry, Shannon, Malpas, Pressley, Hannah,
McLaren, Robertson, Winters, Connolly, Caldwell. Substitutes -- Crabbe,
Brewster, McKinlay, Gilmour, O'Hanlon.
RANGERS -- Thomson, Cleland, Bolan, Moore, Boli, Petric, Murray,
Ferguson, Durrant, Durie, Mikhailichenko. Substitutes -- Brown, Boyack,
Rae, Nicolson, Morrow, Robertson.
Referee -- M Pocock (Edinburgh).

SCANDINAVIAN MASTERS
JESPER Parnevik, the Swede who finished second in the Open
championship at Turnberry last year, played ''unbelievable golf''
yesterday to lead the field by two shots after two rounds of the Volvo
Scandinavian Masters in Malmo.
Despite playing in by far the worst of the weather, strong wind and
heavy rain, Parnevik shot a second successive 67 for a 36-hole aggregate
of 134, two strokes ahead of Barry Lane and New Zealander Michael
Campbell.
Lane (68) and Campbell (67) played in almost ideal conditions in the
morning. But when Parnevik went out, the weather worsened rapidly, yet
he played an almost flawless round which included five birdies.
This week the Swede has played in the pro-am and in two rounds of the
tournament, and in 54 holes has not had a single bogey, an incredible
achievement.
He still has an outside chance of making the European Ryder Cup team
to play the Americans in Rochester, New York, next month but Parnevik is
hardly optimistic.
He said: ''I would have to win the tournament here and the USPGA
championship next week to get enough points to be an automatic
selection.
''I would like to be in the team but I think my only chance is being
one of the two picked and that is up to Bernard Gallacher.
''I have spoken with Joakim Haeggman and he told me that playing in
the Ryder Cup was one of the best experiences of his career.''
Certainly, if Parnevik continues to produce the same form as in the
first two rounds, he must be a strong favourite to carry off this week's
first prize of #108,330.
Lane, who is also keen to make the Ryder Cup team, has a far better
chance of playing for Europe than Parnevik because if he won here, he
would have enough points to be an automatic selection.
He said his swing is still not as good as he would like it to be but
after two 68s he can hardly complain.
Campbell, who finished third in the Open at St Andrews, is also in
with a shout this week but Open champion John Daly only just squeezed
into the last two rounds on the last qualifying score of 145 -- one over
par -- with his second round 74.
Daly, like Parnevik, had the worst of the weather and after 13 holes,
needed two birdies in the last five holes to qualify.
But he did it in style with birdies at the fourteenth and sixteenth
and later said that, considering the wind and rain, the holes from six
to 11 were the toughest he had ever played. Qualifiers (British and

PAUL Carman held his nerve to secure a two-stroke victory in the
Glenmuir Club Professional championship at West Hill in Surrey yesterday
as the Scottish challenge faltered, writes Matthew Lindsay. The
33-year-old veteran ground out a three-under-par 66 to edge clear of the
pack and claim the #8000 winner's cheque.
Poor putting proved costly for overnight leader Fraser Mann, while a
bogey at the penultimate hole saw Colin Gillies drop back, and the
Scottish duo shared second place with Nick Job and Joe Higgins on 271.
Leading aggregates:
269 -- P Carman (Huddersfield) 66, 69, 68, 66. 271 -- N Job (Richmond)
65, 69, 68, 69; J Higgins (Patshull) 69, 65, 69, 68; F Mann

THIS story could have been dreamed up by Alasdair Gray himself. But it
really happened. To explain: there's a scene in Gray's landmark Scottish
novel, Lanark, in which the luckless titular hero brings a selection of
three books to read to a hospital patient he is caring for. (The patient
is in the advanced stages of turning into a dragon and will later give
birth to Lanark's son.) With a flourish of typically colourful Gray
humour, Lanark's three books are as useless as they are disparate: No
Orchids for Miss Blandish, The Holy War and Oor Wullie's Annual for
1938.
So when Glasgow's TAG Theatre Company set about adapting the novel, it
dutifully wrote off for permission to use a copy of Oor Wullie's Annual
on the stage.
Back came the letter from D C Thomson. Impossible! There never was a
1938 edition of Oor Wullie's Annual. So, no, TAG most certainly could
not have permission to use it.
The idea that someone can own the copyright on something that never
existed might have come straight out of Unthank, Alasdair Gray's
fictionalised Glasgow of the future, a grim, desperate place where the
sun never shines, clocks have been abolished, and the only currency that
counts is a unit of time taken from your own life to come. ''It's about
an ordinary person caught up in a world run by lunatics,'' Gray told The
Herald.
Lanark is a big, sprawling book -- so big that it took Gray many years
to find a publisher prepared to print it as a single volume. It is part
political allegory, part sci-fi adventure, part autobiography, part
homage to Glasgow, and part experiment in self-conscious deconstruction.
It's no surprise that the book was almost 30 years in the writing, and
little surprise either that TAG director Tony Graham has been decidedly
cautious about going ahead with an adaptation.
As long ago as the autumn of 1992, Graham led a three-week
experimental workshop with a group of Scottish actors using Lanark as
his source material precisely because it was so untheatrical and could
''challenge assumptions about conventional theatre practice''. The aim
was never to stage Lanark, but to use it as a springboard to find new
forms of expression in theatre and dance.
But now three years on, here's Graham mounting a major version that is
one of only two Scottish theatre productions in the Edinburgh
International Festival.
''I've profoundly changed my position,'' he admits. ''It's flowing
much more easily than I thought. The episodic character of the script
translates well on stage. My fear was that it would be a bit filmic, but
it rather helps the slightly unreal world that's being created.''
The novel has been adapted by Alastair Cording, the actor-cum-writer
behind TAG's 1992 Festival adaptation, A Scots Quair. His script, which
is published in the new edition of Theatre Scotland magazine, rips apart
Gray's novel and rebuilds it to emphasise the many parallels that are
embedded deep within it.
Teamed with an operatic score by Alasdair Nicolson (two parts are
entirely sung), and choreography by Andrew Howitt, the script does its
utmost to find a theatrical form for this most literary of novels.
With a cast of only 12 musicians and actors playing a roster of more
than 40 characters, the necessary doubling of roles is another way of
underlining connections. Neither Graham nor Cording want to push it,
however, and it's telling that the two male leads are played by
different actors -- Laurance Rudic as Lanark and Tom Smith as Duncan
Thaw.
''There are powerful emotional links,'' says Graham, ''but it avoids
any crass one-to-oneness. You cannot come away from that book and say
with any decisiveness, 'Lanark is Duncan Thaw'. It's more difficult than
that, because it's about the relationship between the creator and the
creation, and if we come to easy solutions with that, then we're sunk.''
Gray himself has given his approval to the project, but is generally
keeping his distance. He knows that if he got involved he'd want to take
over the whole show, so he's given them free rein to interpret his book
how they will, and is confining himself to answering their questions. To
coincide with the renewed attention, Gray has recorded an audio version
of Lanark that will be released by Canongate just before the Festival.
* Lanark, TAG Theatre Company, EIF, Assembly Hall. Aug 14-27, 7.30pm.

LAWRENCE BATLEY SENIORS
ALBERTO Croce holed a 25ft putt for an eagle 3 on the final green to
win the Lawrence Batley Seniors tournament in a tense climax at Fixby,
Huddersfield, yesterday.
The 55-year-old professional from Monticello, Como, collected the
#11,000 top prize after a closing three-under-par 68 for a
four-under-total of 209.
A play-off seemed likely when Croce and British partners Tommy Horton
and Malcolm Gregson all arrived at the eighteenth at two under.
Last year's top European senior, John Morgan, was already in the
clubhouse on two under, after a best-of-the-day four-under 67.
Horton made a birdie for a 69 and 210 but Gregson three-putted to drop
back and share third spot with Morgan on 211.
Croce's win follows his share of second place behind fellow
countryman, Ronato Campagnoli in the German International seniors in
Frankfurt last month. Final totals (GB and Ire unless stated):
209 -- A Croce (Italy) 69, 72, 68.
210 -- T Horton 74, 67, 69.
211 -- M Gregson 73, 69, 69; J Morgan 71, 73, 67.
212 -- L W Higgins 71, 73, 68.
213 -- B Huggett 70, 74, 69; N Coles 70, 72, 71.
215 -- A Garrido (Spain) 72, 73, 70.
216 -- B Verwey (S Africa) 76, 70 ,70.
217 -- R Campagnoli (Italy) 72, 75, 70.
218 -- D Simon (USA) 68, 79, 71; F Abreu (Spain) 77, 68, 73; B
Thatcher (USA) 74, 73, 71.

* Forget artificial air-fresheners -- flood your home with the fresh
colours and sea-breeze scents of the Mediterranean, urges WENDY
ORMISTON. Magnolia, jasmine and geraniums can be grown successfully in a
sunny spot and give delightful fragrances.
For the conservatory, choose baby tomatoes and grape vines as fruity
alternatives. Use plenty of window boxes, terracotta pots and
brightly-painted planters. You can get them, reasonably priced, at most
DIY shops.
If you're looking for something different, try painted pots; but as
these usually cost more, consider doing the brushwork yourself. A row of
mini-pots filled with herbs is very effective -- basil, oregano and
marjoram are easy to grow and look good on the kitchen sill.
The Victorian herb garden from Lakeland Plastics is ideal for small
plants or flowers. Specifically designed for the conservatory or patio,
it is made of tough, weatherproof polypropylene which looks just like
terracotta. The six sections join to make up a hexagon, and each can be
removed separately for planting or repotting. At #25.95 it is good value
and virtually unbreakable.
John Lewis stocks Portuguese terracotta planters in various sizes.
Decorated with a yellow wash and blue-dot trim they come in sets of
three with a matching ceramic tray.
Hand-painted Olympia planters, with yellow or green washes and a blue
or orange trim, come in two sizes at #8.50 and #6.50. Other variations
cost from #3.95 to #12.50 for an assortment of sizes with coloured bands
around the top.
Reservoir planters eliminate the need for daily watering. Pack them
full of geraniums, stack them in the corner of a room and let them grow
wild. Available from Lakeland Plastics, with prices starting at #3.50.

The fiendish role of Mephistopheles Smith has skyrocketed Richard
O'Brien to stardom. Stephen McGinty meets the actor and discovers a
sensitive side to the man who can transform from Mother Teresa to
Freddie Kruger.
RICHARD O'Brien, like the Devil, is utterly charming. And as he is as
bald as a coot, it means you can check his cranium for 666, the number
of the Beast. O'Brien wouldn't have anything so ordinary. No, he would
have 667, the neighbour of the Beast, and as Mephistopheles Smith, he
fits rather smoothly into Satan's tuxedo and tails. Even the
nipple-shaped horns and phallic tail seem to sprout quite naturally.
You see, Hell is no longer what it used to be. It's time for a change
of direction.
Exit Hell in a puff of sulphur, and enter the Club Inferno, an After
Life Facility for kids who just wanna have fun, lorded over by the
graciously camp Mephistopheles Smith. Now there are no more deals, it's
only the invited souls who can gain entry and access to the Devil's
music, ''rock 'n' roll'' from The Fabulous Frockettes, and Smith's band
of Black Angels.
Twenty-two years after he launched The Rocky Horror Picture Show,
Richard O'Brien remains Disgracefully Yours, by extending an invite to
eternity's most exclusive rock'n'roll party.
''It started as an opportunity for me to swan around in a camp fashion
and sing rock'n'roll songs. As I was a demon I could get away with
murder. I'll just sing some songs and have a natter with the audience.
What we have done is clear the decks and re-assess it. All I'm doing is
letting people know that this is the way it is.
''If they could kind of gravitate to our way, I'll check them out. I
don't do deals anymore as Mephistopheles Smith. I should be looking over
you to see if you're the kind of person we want. If you're hunky, funky,
and spunky, that in a nutshell is what we're after. We are the only
after-life that allows people to encourage the maintenance of physical
pleasures.''
The Devil continues to get the best tunes with O'Brien doing 10
numbers including Welcome To One Hell Of A Party, Heart On Fire, and You
Bring Out The Angel In Me. The show has evolved since Smith entertained
the audiences of Rocky's 21st anniversary tour. The Festival Fringe is
an opportunity to develop the character and rehearse songs for a future
album.
Incredibly, 1995 will be the first year Richard O'Brien has had his
Fringe cut. You would have expected the colour and insanity of the
Fringe to have attracted him long before now. But that is the problem,
people and their preconceptions.
O'Brien quit The Crystal Maze after four highly-successful series
because he was bored, but the fact that kids used to chase him through
airports didn't help. Even here in his new block of flats, people assume
the public persona is the private man.
Making coffee in his gantry kitchen he talks of how he was sitting in
his little concrete garden when neighbours upstairs peered out. He
mimics voices, while stirring with a spoon: ''Look -- it's that geezer
from the telly -- go and get his autograph.'' Before snarling an
imagined reply: ''Why don't you f*** off!'' a demon flashes across his
face and disappears.
''Do you take sugar? No? Lovely.''
He describes himself as a man who can ''transform from Mother Teresa
to Freddie Kruger''. Today he lives with his second wife Jane, and his
two young children in an Edwardian house in Sussex. Gentleness and
kindness earn his deepest respects.
''We have got it all wrong -- we worship strength,'' says O'Brien who,
although raised in the Church Of England, began poking holes in
religious homilies after moving to New Zealand as a 10-year-old.
His family moved around, and at the Sunday schools of Evangelicals,
Baptists, and Seventh Day Adventists he became curious at how people can
take the same text, then apply different rules which they always break.
Today his concept of God is personal, but seems central to his life.
''When I pray I pray to all the gods. I say out loud that I am
nothing, I am dust, I am a simple fool, bless me if you can. I am
nothing. You go to the gods with great respect.''
Richard O'Brien has come to the conclusion that God did not create man
but that man created God. The power of wishes and prayer can form a
cloud of energy which is, in essence, God.
The distance between people's concept of God and the Devil, he feels,
can feed the negative. ''The polarity is damning. It's kept in place so
that others might be able to get their point of view across. I think the
embracing of the other side's point of view diminishes it. You defeat
your demons with love . . .
''I've had nights when demon faces came into my nightmares. In the
darkness, there was demonic faces laughing and when the final one came
up to me I just kissed it. And as I kissed it I said 'I love you', and
it disappeared. As I say, you defeat your demons with love.''
O'Brien is conscious of how his work and opinions can be misconstrued.
''I'm a frivolous kind of demon. And if I touch on any subject it will
be in a frivolous kind of manner.''
His frivolity and seductiveness with a song-sheet have also been
channelled into the script of a new movie entitled Alive On Arrival.
O'Brien and director Robert Dawnhelm are attempting to raise #14m to
fund the comic musical. Metaphysical questions abound as a down-at-heels
girl is accidentally struck by the Grim Reaper.
''She goes to the land of the dead and she's alive on arrival. She
scares the living daylights out of them because they're dead. The big
question here is: is there life before death? They know they are dead,
they're just not sure if they have lived?''
Through a series of comic escapes and humourous songs, she learns that
it was life she was afraid of, not death. O'Brien's works at their most
pagan are deep celebrations of life.
''I don't write didactic theatre. I don't want to proselytise in
anything I do. If I take some subjects that people want to take a little
further over a glass of wine and a joint, then that is fine. But I don't
set out to do that. Just as I didn't set out for people to go home and
have sex after The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
''But I'm delighted if the show acted as foreplay.''
A keen collector of religious art and imagery, O'Brien has a crucifix
hanging in his hall with handcuffs draped round the feet. Statues of
saints stand solemnly in vigil over his little writing desk. Photographs
of his two youngest children, Joshua and Emily, sit on a shelf beside a
home-made card.
O'Brien picks it up and points to the chubby stump noughts and crosses
on the base. ''My little girl said the crosses were kisses, so I asked
her what the noughts were for. She said: 'They're hugs, daddy.' Isn't
that sweet?''
And his face lights up like an angel.

* THE Mediterranean. These past weeks of sweltering days and sultry
nights, who has needed the hot and colourful countries where the shores
are caressed by the warm blue waters of the Med?
Ah, we may have the sun, fiercely hot at that, but what about the
elusive missing factor in our British homes: that mesmeric, seductive
ambience of the Mediterranean we love so well?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could capture the look, the spirit, and
recreate it in our own homes and gardens? But how?
Alison Jones, design coordinator for decorative accessories at
Habitat, summarises the blueprint as colour, shape and texture. The
Mediterranean atmosphere can be at least partly achieved, she believes,
''by that idealistic, dreamy world of beautiful things: glass, ceramics,
textiles, furniture in natural tones of light wood, teak and
lacquer-coloured woods''.
Warming to her theme, she continues: ''There's the influence of space
that comes from the outdoors, and the happy blend of linking indoors and
outdoors. Colour is very important -- aquas, greens, blues, terracotta,
fresh orange, yellow -- all in strong tones.''
Many Habitat designs fill the bill admirably, it must be said. Lofty
tented canopies to dine under; hammocks on which to swing, the only
sound the lazy, summery drone of the bee's hum; candlelight for summer
evening dining; terracotta pots and baskets crammed to overflowing with
vibrant flowering plants; brilliantly coloured ceramics and glasses,
bright table mats and napkins; comfortable seating and sturdy tables
arranged into tasteful groups.
Put all these things together with a bit of imagination and dash, and
you can create your own little patch of Mediterranean style, without
ever leaving home.

WHAT a tiring play this is. Set in a modern-day Perthshire mansion,
Allan Massie's new one is about a group of well-to-do semi-professionals
who come together to put on a production of The Cherry Orchard. Massie's
play runs parallel to Chekov's, until the final twist where it switches
from morose Russian gloom to a pantomime-style happy ending.
It's tiring partly because of Massie's breathless and expansive style
of dialogue, short on full stops and long on non-sequiturs. He uses this
to deliberate comic effect in the central role of Diana Lockhart-Nairn,
played by Clare Richards in the elliptical style of Private Eye's Great
Bores of Today.
But it's a style that affects all 11 characters, which means that even
though Clive Perry's production rattles along, it still lasts over
two-and-a-half hours.
But more than this, it's the content of the speeches that wears you
out.
Massie's characters are obsessively self-confessional. They don't wait
round for intimacy or alcohol, they just leap straight in with their
anxieties, hopes, and fears. Mid-life crisis follows lovers' tiff
follows sexual uncertainty, follows marital discord, and it's all quite
exhausting.
On the plus side there are entertaining performances from Guy Nicholls
and Jeff Shankley, and a sprinkling of witty lines in a play that
doesn't give you a moment to get bored. On the downside there are some
irritating performances from the younger members of the cast, a Scottish
accent so bad it would be laughed off the stage in Worthing, and a
tendency to litter the script with pointless literary allusions. And, in
the end, I've no idea why it was written.

''BLOODY good!'' was the ultimate verdict from a paying punter in one
of the front rows when our Fred's pre-Edinburgh run-through of Unfringed
had reached its conclusion on Thursday night. While such praise might
reassure most stand-ups, I suspect it won't have entirely pleased
perfectionist Fred.
He's always in pursuit of the blooming brilliant and the flipping
fantastic, you see, and Thursday night's effort was just a little too
disjointed for that. Additionally, Fred's numerous small-screen
successes of late seem to have won him a new and disruptively ardent
female following who plainly view him as Perth's top bit of telly-totty.
On Thursday, for instance, their hero's proximity impelled them to
offer ribald compliments and/or coo his name in giggly tones at
inapposite moments in his act. Aye, sometimes Fred can be too good for
his own good. But whether you want a lust-object or a laughter-eejit,
Fred'll be your man in Edinburgh.
Oily Max Sharp and cutting Jill Peacock and their Corduroy Hostess --
she's called Alan, and she actually does wear corduroy, incidentally --
are a different kettle of whelks. Deriving all-too-obvious inspiration
from Vic and Bob's free-form Big Night Out, Max and Jill pleasantly
engage in deconstructive anarchy. Here an unravelled Meatloaf song,
there an act of homage to Pebble Mill At One.
Alan simpers fetchingly, as a chap with wiggly hair plays the piano.
Old-stagers might find themselves wishing for what used to be called
''jokes''. Scorning such comedic props, Max and Jill's show bravely
reverses towards Edinburgh. Who knows where they'll end up.

The colour is captured in the crockery, says Jean Graham
* YELLOWS, ochres and blues, the natural colours of
Mediterranean-style crockery, can add sunshine to your home, whether as
decorative jars and vases or strictly functional crockery.
Italian and Portuguese ceramics in particular are widely available.
John Lewis stocks some unusual designs, such as Italian Pulcino Blue, a
white bird on blue, pink and green. Equally suited to an entire dinner
set or a single item, it comes in the usual service pieces plus tea cup
#7.50, saucer #2.75, mug #6.95 and pitcher #23.
Marks and Spencer uses the traditional, sunny blues and yellows of
southern Europe in its Sienna design range -- which includes pasta and
salad bowls at #13 and #10, together with mugs, jugs and the
conventional dinner plates and cup-and-saucer sets.
Habitat's Tika and Roma crockery feature the strong colours of the
Mediterranean in simple, informal designs. Tika comes in grass green and
gold, navy and green or amber and gold. Dinner plates cost #2.95. Roma
is an exuberant, loosely geometric design in shades of green with gold
and navy or amber with navy and green. A dinner plate costs #6.50.
Habitat also stocks a variety of other Mediterranean designs and an
enormous range of glass tumblers in aquamarine, turquoise, raspberry,
amber and green, ideal for relaxed, everyday dining.
For those with a real passion for colour, Ware on Earth is well worth
a visit. The company has recently closed its Glasgow store, but its
Edinburgh shop at 15 Howe Street has been expanded and offers an
unparalleled range of authentic Mediterranean crockery, including Corrao
hand-painted Sicilian ceramics.
Produced by the Corrao family, these very collectable pieces are
boldly decorated with vivid designs featuring fish, fruit and flowers.
Mugs cost #6.95, jugs vary from #7.95 to #19.95 and spaghetti bowls are
#12.95. A selection of broad, shallow dishes in the same designs is
ideal for displaying on the wall or dresser and can be used for serving
elaborate salads or plates of pasta. The shop also stocks a range of
tableware from other Mediterranean suppliers. Spanish Fruits and fresh,
blue and yellow Giallo are particularly attractive.
Continue the Mediterranean feel with table and kitchen ware made from
glass. Elegant olive oil drizzlers cost #3.50 at Habitat and #2.59 by
mail order from Lakeland Plastics (tel: 015394 88100 for a catalogue).
Habitat also sells cheap, practical bottles and jars made from recycled
glass starting at #2.50, while the selection of clear and cobalt blue
glassware at Next Interiors could add a purely decorative touch to a
more formal occasion.
Lakeland Plastics' colourful, Spanish-made glass bottles at #9.45 for
four in red, yellow, blue and green are ideal for storing and serving
home-made vinegars and oils, while its selection of Mediterranean
dishes, made from natural terracotta and hand-glazed in traditional
Spanish potteries, is just the thing for preparing and presenting a
summer meal. The dishes cost #4.85 and #7.95. An authentic terracotta
salsa bowl with glazed interior at #5.45 is perfect for sauces, salsas
and dressings.

THIS venerable institution, whose origins date back over 500 years to
the days when Edinburgh was a tiny one-street village strung out below
the castle, might seem an unlikely contender in the Trailblazing stakes
of the late 20th century. But since 1457, when the Scottish Parliament
first set standards for gold and silver work, hallmarking has been
vitally important as a guarantee of quality in all gold, silver, and
jewellery work.
And it is the Assay Office of Edinburgh which, having become almost
moribund after surviving the vicissitudes and the triumphs of five
centuries of turbulent history, is celebrating a glowing renaissance.
Back in 1525, medieval Edinburgh granted the Incorporation of
Goldsmiths of Edinburgh its Seal of Cause -- a document recognising the
master goldsmiths' competence, and regulating their craft and conduct.
The Seal entrusted them with ensuring the purity of all gold and silver
work made in Scotland.
Over the years, the goldsmiths of Edinburgh grew to become a highly
respected, self-governing, and leading Edinburgh craft incorporation,
its responsibility and duty to assay all those pieces which reached the
statutory standards, confirmed in 1687 by Royal Charter.
However, more recently the power and influence of the incorporation,
its deacon and master goldsmith members, gradually declined, and by the
late 20th century the incorporation was in danger of exhausting its
funds in its support of the work of the Assay Office, which had accrued
losses over many years.
Scottish gold and silver craftsmen and jewellery importers were
looking south to the assay offices of England for their hallmarking. The
Scottish Assay Office was in mortal danger.
Fortunately, Michael Laing, managing director of Laings the Jewellers,
recognised the enormous potential in its historic name and function, the
value to Scotland of the heritage of the Scottish Hallmark, and the
marvellous opportunities still existing to create once more a centre of
excellence: an Assay Office which was the best in the UK.
In 1992 Laing became chairman of the board of directors; at the same
time a number of appointments were made to the board to bring in
experienced and committed businessmen.
The new board drew up a three-year plan to address the areas of
customer relations, finance, operations, property, marketing and the
European Union.
The Assay Office aimed to take advantage of its small size to adopt a
closer and more friendly relationship with its customers and to provide
them with a genuinely personal and efficient service.
A computerised management system was introduced so that proper
financial targets and assessments could be made and the business
adjusted accordingly.
The operations of the Assay Office were so improved that the quality
and speed of service are now, says Laing, second to none.
A minute scraping taken from every piece of finished jewellery is
analysed before the hallmark is punched. The Scottish Assay Office has
recruited trained jewellers with an instinctive appreciation of the
product and a feeling for metal to carry out this task.
A new Assay Master was recruited. As a qualified analytical chemist he
was able to improve many aspects of the laboratory testing operations.
The Assay Office also moved from Granton to a more central location in
Edinburgh.
In terms of marketing, it sought to raise the profile of the Scottish
hallmarks, to capitalise on the splendid sense of history which they
invoke. Ex-patriot Scots and tourists as well as native Scots can easily
be persuaded of the cachee which the mark of the lion rampant and the
castle lends to christening spoons or quaichs, salvers, or wedding
rings.
And to encourage a new generation of artists and craftsmen in silver
and gold, the incorporation donates money to Scottish Art Colleges for
the purchase of expensive precious metals.
Lest all this progress be lost, it was vital to ensure the future of
the Scottish Hallmark. The European Union's proposals on opening up the
British market threatened the whole future of the Assay Office. However,
intensive lobbying has paid off and the Scottish Hallmark now looks
secure.
The result of the completely fresh course on which the Assay Office
has embarked has proved dramatic. Turnover leapt by 40% in 1993-94,
while this year it is on target to rise by another 30%. As the fastest
growing Assay Office in Britain, it is now hallmarking over 600,000
items a year, it has won back Scottish jewellers and craftsmen, and it
has made such inroads into England that now 22% of its business comes
from south of the Border.
A solid reflection of the sterling efforts made by all concerned -- by
Laing and his board and by the Assay Office team in the last three
years.

DIARY readers will recall we recently commented on the fact that
companies have suddenly taken to go-karting as a way of entertaining
their clients.
Responding to this demand Gladsmuir-based Karting Indoors plans a
#250,000 expansion project which will treble its size and add a
corporate lounge and viewing gallery to the complex. In the last year
the venue has played host to a galaxy of executive karters including
Kleinwort Benson, BZW, James Capel, Morgan Stanley, Hoare Govett and
Edinburgh fund managers.
But it isn't just grey-suited fund managers who use the centre.
Scottish Television asked Lorna and Gen Forrest (aged 10 and 11
respectively) to take a crash course on using a camcorder and film
themselves in and around the centre for a programme in the Saturday
morning series Shoot. With their sister Kim, 13, they form the Forrest
Flyers racing team and are members of the Karting Indoors Junior
Raceland Club.
A Scottish Television executive described their effort as: ''One of
the most interesting video diaries we've had for the programme.''
Clearly the girls, who are currently looking for sponsorship, have all
the right instincts for business success. They could do worse than knock
on the doors of some of the blue-chip companies who use the centre for
corporate fun.

CUSTOMERS of the Clydesdale Bank could be forgiven for thinking an
unholy political alliance was being formed in the West of Scotland when
they spotted Glasgow District councillor Jean McFadden, Tory MP Allan
Stewart and former Lord Provost of Glasgow, Michael Kelly, entering the
bank's headquarters in Buchanan Street, Glasgow.
They can relax however. It is not a Scottish version of the gang of
four. It was simply the case that Clydesdale Bank executive George
Edwards had organised a high-powered seminar to brief the bank's senior
officials on the implications of the impending local government
re-organisation.
Allan Stewart's involvement is explained by the fact that he was the
Scottish Office minister who had the responsibility of guiding the local
authority reform bill through Parliament.
Allan, it seems, is proud of the fact that despite fierce opposition
from his political opponents he succeeded in his tasks without having to
apply the guillotine. However, it is rumoured that he was tempted to use
it on some individual Labour MPs.

IT seems that the major auction of timeshare properties which takes
place at the end of this month in the Royal Scot Hotel, Edinburgh is a
sign of the times we live in.
The cynics may have thought that the properties which are up for grabs
in are the visible results of owners who felt they had been ''conned''
into buying the property in the first instance.
Not so. According to auction organisers Alasdair Seale and Ed Henry,
of Trinity Factors, the sales have arisen because of the rising number
of divorce actions and business failures.
Ed Henry told business diary: ''I suppose you could say it reflects
the changing state of the British economy and its effect on family life.
A lot of timeshares come on to the market because of divorce of business
failures.''
Over 150 lots are up for sale at prices ranging from #1000 to #15,000.

Glasgow District Council and Strathclyde Business Development, SCDC is
launching a nine-week training programme aimed at developing people's
marketing and information technology skills.
Anyone interested should contact Millie Burnett at SCDC on
0141-554-3797.
Part of the course will include a week-long placement with either a
co-operative or employee-owned concern which proves that SCDC has not

GRANT Thornton's corporate finance department have been so busy
picking up sporting honours in recent weeks that you wonder if they have
had any time for work.
Corporate finance partner Jim Borrows captained their five-a-side
football team which won the 3i tournament recently.
The department also walked away with two go-karting competition prizes
at Cambuslang not long ago.
''We won both the Bank of Scotland and Wright Johnstone McKenzie
events,'' Jim Borrows told me.
Jim denied, however, that it was a case of all fun and no work. He
pointed out that his department has been involved in three major
management buy outs this year -- Albion Automotives, DL Wholesale, and
Currie Line.
To conclude the #20m Albion deal Jim made himself rather unpopular
with his family when he broke off from a touring holiday in Germany to
fly back to Glasgow. ''It was only a couple of days,'' said Jim, ''and I
had done all the chores on the site before I left''.
I wonder if Mrs Borrows would agree?

GUIDE dogs for the blind are among the most admired creatures.
Everyone praises the work they do on behalf of their owners, but how
many of us stop to think about the dogs themselves?
Sue Jarvie, a partner in accountancy firm Whitelaw Wells, is one of
the few to remember the dogs. She tells Business Diary: ''A lot of
owners think their dog has been exercised after being out all day in the
harness, but it's important for the dog's general happiness and
well-being for it to run free, and play.
''There are so many people who would like to have a pet dog but quite
rightly don't because they are out all day. They should be looking for a
nearby guide dog to take out on a regular basis''.
Matching action to words she and her sister, Fiona, take guide dogs --
Frolic, Delia and Lithk -- out for a run on Arthur's Seat every weekend.
''We've taken up to seven guide dogs out on the beach at St Andrews,
but that can be quite difficult to control.''

INDOOR international Graeme Archer from Sighthill club in Edinburgh
lines up in this afternoon's ScottishPower National Singles Championship
final at Ayr Northfield against the winner of this morning's second
semi-final between Armadale's Grant Knox and Oban's Willie Hay.
This follows the shock exit by Commonwealth gold medallist Richard
Corsie in yesterday's quarter-finals.
Corsie, chasing a first title in the event, looked to be heading for a
last-four spot when he led 14-10 after 16 ends against Falkirk's Alan
Hutchison, but five ends later it was all over with Corsie on the
receiving end of a 21-16 defeat.
Hutchison enjoyed a run of 3, 3 and 2 to move 18-14 ahead before
Corsie closed the gap with a double on the twentieth end.
However Hutchison immediately hit back counting the three shots he
needed for victory on the next end.
''I can't really have any complaints. On the day, Alan played the
better bowls,'' said a disappointed Corsie.
That win pushed Hutchison through to a semi-final clash with Archer
who had crushed Orwell's Brian Russell 21-5 in his quarter-final.
Archer then opened up a 19-12, 16-end lead over the Falkirk player,
but Hutchison stormed back and with Archer looking increasingly nervous
tied the scores at 20-20 after 21 ends.
Hutchison then played a perfect last end but could only look on in
horror as Archer produced a great final bowl that sprung the jack to
give him the shot he needed for victory.
Knox and Hay will fight out the second semi-final this morning after
Knox, the Commonwealth pairs gold medallist at Edinburgh back in 1986,
edged out West End's Alan Cairnie 21-19 while Hay, a member of
Scotland's Commonweath squad from Victoria last year beat former world
team gold medallist Doug Lambert from Bridge of Earn 21-15. Results:

YOU report that RAF Edzell, the former US naval base, is to close with
the loss of 400 jobs and a loss to the local economy of #20m per year.
We hear that the Scottish Office has no contingency plan to offset
this economic disaster in a locality where jobs are scarce, but that
there is to be a Task Force.
May we ask the Scottish Secretary of State who leads the Task Force;
who serve on its main committee; what is its brief; what resources does
it have (it cost #18m in Dunoon when the submarine base closed); and
will it consult with and report to the people of North Angus and Mearns?

DEFENDING champion Wendy Everson broke her own championship 1000
metres sprint record in the qualifying time trial at the British
national track championships in Manchester yesterday.
She covered the last 200m in 11.972sec. to slice 0.16 off her own 1994
record and beat her nearest rival, 1993 champion Sally Boyden, by more
than half-a-second. Later, Everson and 1993 champion Sally Boyden won
their quarter-final matches.
Shaun Wallace, the American-based professional who held the amateur
title in 1984, last night raced to a championship record of 1min
6.557sec in the open kilometre time trial.
Wallace, one of five riders to beat the old record set by Portsmouth's
Rob Hayles in 1993, beat defending champion Hayles by just 0.025sec.
Edinburgh's Anthony Stirrat took the bronze medal.
North Wirral Velo improved almost a second on their qualifying time to
win their quarter-final in the 4000m team pursuit. They covered the 16
laps in 4min.25.6sec, catching local rivals Westmead Team 88 before
half-distance.
City of Edinburgh RC, second-fastest qualifiers earlier in the day,
also had an easy ride, against Stockport Clarion, catching them after
3min 11sec and going on to clock 4-28.01.
Men's 4000m team pursuit qualifying time trial -- 1, North Wirral
Velo, 4min.26.58sec; 2, City of Edinburgh RC, 4-30.94; 3, VC St Raphael,
4-34.54.
Women's 1000m sprint qualifying time trial (times for last 200m) -- 1,
W Everson (RAF CC) 11.972sec (championship record); 2, S Boyden
(Swaledale CC) 12.544; 3, M Hughes (Cwmcarn Paragon) 12.549.
* BELGIAN Johan Museeuw defends a fragile six-point lead as the World
Cup series resumes with the Leeds Classic over 144.7 miles tomorrow.
Gianluca Bortolami, who won last year's race, is in the field, but the
chief challenge should come from Frenchman Laurent Jalabert.
He is 36 points behind Museeuw and poses the biggest threat, as
second-placed Mauro Giannetti is absent through injury.
A high finish in the Classic is crucial to Museeuw, as he is
contesting only two of the remaining four races in the series.
The race has fallen to Italians for the past three years, but Jalabert
has strong support this time from Alex Zuelle and Melchor Mauri, second
and sixth respectively in the Tour, and Belgian stage winner Johan
Bruyneel.

I FEEL I must write to clarify comments attributed to me in your
report on the withdrawal of the County Palatine Housing Society from the
ballot to acquire the housing stock of Irvine Development Corporation
(MP criticises corporation, August 2).
As someone who has been a fierce critic of Irvine Development
Corporation's strategy for the disposal of its housing stock, I feel
that I rightly commented that the corporation's stock disposal strategy
was ''in tatters'' as a result of the Palatine Housing Society's
withdrawal from the housing ballot.
This decision leaves only the local authority, Cunninghame District
Council and the Irvine Housing Association, bankrolled to the tune of
#300,000 and run by staff seconded from IDC, in the ballot to take over
corporation's housing.
However, I feel I must also point out that I have always believed that
the interests of IDC tenants would be best served by them opting for
Cunninghame District Council, and its successor the North Ayrshire
Council, as their landlord following the corporation's wind-up next
year.
This would be the case against any other potential bidder for IDC's
housing stock and, as such, as long as tenants have the right to
transfer to the local authority, this is the option I would be advising
them to take in order to protect their long-term interests.
I trust that this explains my position in light of your report which
may have given a wrong impression as to my position on this matter.

WHILE we commemorate the ending of the war against Japan we should
remember how that victory was finally won.
There was then released a monstrous force which ever since we have
struggled to control. We have so far failed to do so.
Other countries are keen to achieve a similar capacity for wholesale
destruction but we think only the good people like ourselves and our
friends should have such power.
At the same time we are desperately trying to find some means of
disposing safely of the waste products.
We should look carefully at our politicians to try to find out how
many are of a similar mind to those who agreed to drop the bombs.

SERB civilians in cars, tractors and trucks streamed towards Bosnia
from the fighting, the newest exodus in the worsening Balkan conflict.
Aid organisations warned that ''tens of thousands'' of people could
flee from Croatia, and the mass movement would further blur the line
between wars in the two former Yugoslav republics.
Bosnian and UN sources said the Croatian and Bosnian armies had been
closely co-ordinating attacks on the Serbs. Bosnian army sources said
that their forces in the north-western Bihac enclave were advancing
westward toward Croatia.
Mr Mans Nyberg, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,
said roughly 150 people had arrived in central Bosnia from Knin, the
embattled stronghold of Serbs in southern Croatia. ''We're preparing for
an influx of Serb refugees, perhaps tens of thousands,'' he added.
UNHCR officials were monitoring cars and trucks filled with Serb
civilians moving from central Croatia toward the northern Bosnian town
of Bosanki Novi.
Another column of civilians, with belongings jammed on to tractors and
trucks, was seen heading toward Bosnia from Serb-held Glina, Mr Nyberg
said.
''This indicates a large movement of people,'' he said.
The UNHCR and the International Committee of the Red Cross were
massing food and material to care for the Serb refugees. An estimated
13,000 Serbs -- the largest Serb refugee movement since Bosnia's war
began in April 1992 -- have already fled across central Bosnia in recent
days.
Hungary, traditionally the first destination for people fleeing the
former Yugoslavia, is preparing for an influx of refugees, a top
Hungarian official said.
''Geography dictates that as the country closest to the fighting, we
will get a good proportion of the refugees,'' Mr Gabor Vilagosi, the
political secretary (deputy minister) of the interior said. ''We are
making preparations to deal with it.''
Tensions have mounted steadily in Croatia since it agreed on July 22
to bolster military co-operation with Bosnia.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has made no secret of his plans to
recapture the Krajina rebels' territory. He has about 100,000 men -- the
full battle strength of his army -- massed against about 50,000
well-armed Serbs.
In Zagreb, Croatian spokesmen were pleased with the first day of their
offensive which they said had penetrated more than 20 miles into the
separatist enclave. Their troops had almost captured one big rebel Serb
town and encircled two others, including the breakaway ''capital'' Knin,
they added.
Defence ministry spokesman Mr Ivan Tolj said that the town of
Petrinja, 25 miles south of Zagreb, had virtually fallen although street
fighting was raging in some districts.
Croatian troops had stormed 22 miles westwards in hours and encircled
Glina while other government forces closed in on Knin from all
directions 125 miles to the south in mountains near the Bosnian border.
The strategic Sveti Rok mountain pass six miles inland from the
Adriatic coast near Zadar had also fallen, Mr Tolj said.
A spokeswoman for President Tudjman, Ms Natasa Rajakovic, said: ''If
everything goes well this will take much less than a month (to retake
rebel Serb-held areas) but a little longer than this weekend.''
Mr Tolj said Croatian troops had disabled some Serb missile launchers
near Glina which had been aimed at Zagreb.
He told journalists that Zagreb's aim was to take the whole Krajina
region and ''establish Croatian constitutional order''. Day one of the
offensive had gone well, he said.
''Knin is encircled, we are just a few miles away from Knin now,'' he
added.
Mr Tolj said that the Serbs, who have conceded they are no military
match for the Croats without help from Belgrade, had mustered strong
resistance but their lines were buckling.
''We are hitting the strongest Serb lines now supported by artillery
and rocket launchers. But Serb lines have been disrupted and
destabilised and so the Serbs have had to move in (poorer) reserve
units.
''Both military and civilian authorities are in a state of panic. The
first day of operations has gone according to plan,'' he said.
Knin shook under artillery barrage that began at dawn and continued
all day. Buildings blazed in streets deserted except for the occasional
car loaded with belongings and packed with civilians fleeing in panic.
Colonel Andrew Leslie, a senior UN military officer in the rebel
stronghold spoke of ''serious loss civilian life'' in the town. Hospital
doctors were treating wounded in basements and Croatian troops were said
to be close to breaching defence lines.
The UN, while acknowledging Croatian advances elsewhere along 725-mile
front line, could not confirm that Knin was near falling.
The Serbs themselves said their lines around Knin and elsewhere were
generally holding.
Some 90 peacekeepers from Canada, Jordan, Poland, Denmark and the
Czech Republic were being detained by the Croats and Colonel Leslie said
the Croats had shot at ''innumerable peacekeepers' observation posts and
peacekeepers''.
The Croats were ''trying to intimidate us into abandoning our
positions so they can get on with whatever it is they want to do,'' he
said. ''That is not our intent.''
Bosnian Serbs fired on a UN convoy on a mountain road outside Sarajevo
tonight, damaging one vehicle and drawing a flurry of return fire from
peacekeepers based at the city airport, a UN spokesman said.
''A UN logistics convoy of 26 vehicles on the Igman road was fired
upon by Bosnian Serbs using 76mm and 30mm cannon,'' said UN spokesman
Lieutenant-Colonel Gerard Dubois. UN troops at the airport had
immediately responded with 20mm and 90mm cannon fire, after which the
Serb attack ceased, he added. -- AP/Reuter.

CASES continue to be reported concerning the re-offending of criminals
while free on parole or some similar premature release from custody.
Those responsible for such early releases of offenders are seldom
criticised, or even named, for what are blatant errors of judgment. Only
the new and innocent victim appears to suffer.
While there are doubtless many rehabilitated offenders re-absorbed
into society with the assistance of these advisory bodies, it can also
be argued that one failure, let alone dozens of failures, is one too
many.
This is particularly so in cases of violence and rape. Very often it
is not even first offenders who are involved.
With the power to recommend early release goes an awesome
responsibility. Any failure to discharge this, and which results in some
innocent party suffering, should invite open debate and, if appropriate,
censure and dismissal.
Those who place themselves in positions of public yet unelected
authority should not seek to avoid the public scrutiny which this must
entail.

SERBIA'S President Slobodan Milosevic carefully maintained his
peaceful stance in the face of the new fighting in Krajina, condemning
Croatia's offensive and urging energetic action by the international
community.
Pesident Milosevic, whose role could be crucial in preventing the
Balkan conflict escalating any further, said: ''It has become apparent
that Croatia represents the biggest threat to peace in the Balkans.'' He
was speaking after meeting UN mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg in Belgrade.
''Our country justly expects that the international community takes
action in keeping with our own, proclaimed principles and commitment to
peace.''
Mr Milosevic said Croatia's ''agressive posturing'' dangerously
threatened to fan a new war, ''which deserves every condemnation''.
He has promised humanitarian assistance, but so far ignored pleas by
the Krajina Serbs to come to their rescue with his formidable army.
His statement came as the European Union peace envoy to former
Yugoslavia, Mr Carl Bildt castigated Croatia and suggested that
President Franjo Tudjman could be held responsible for any war crimes
committed against Serb civilians.
In a statement issued by his office in Geneva, the former Swedish
premier said: ''The Croatian offensive against its Serb-populated area
must be condemned in the sharpest possible terms.
''This comes immediately after the start of negotiations, and with
clear signs of Serb willingness to make substantial concessions on both
economic and political issues,'' he added.
''It will cast a dark shadow over Croatia for a long time to come.
Especially appalling is the shelling of the civilian population now
being reported.''
Mr Bildt noted that the Krajina Serb ''president'', Mr Milan Martic,
was indicted for war crimes after a rocket attack on Zagreb in May.
''It is difficult to see any difference between these actions and the
shelling of Knin (the Serb stronghold) which President Tudjman must now
be held responsible for,'' Mr Bildt said.
Britain, Russia, Germany and France called on Croatia to cease its
military action immediately.
The four countries, along with the United States, make up the Contact
Group which has been trying to broker peace.
Other European nations to join in the condemnation and to call for
peace talks were Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.
In London the Foreign Office issued a statement warning that the
viability of the peace process was endangered by Croatia's actions.
Strongly condemning Croatia's action, the statement said it was clear
that the possibility of further negotiations had not been exhausted.
The Foreign Office said: ''The British Government urges the Croatian
authorities to stop their military action immediately and for both
parties to continue the negotiations started in Geneva.''
There is anger in Whitehall that the attack came only hours after the
UN Security Council had appealed to both Serbs and Croats to draw back
from full-scale war.
However, in Washington the White House expressed only muted concern
about the fighting and Defense Secretary William Perry voiced the hope
that it might stop Serb attacks on the Bosnian Muslim enclave of Bihac.
''We're concerned,'' President Bill Clinton's spokesman Mr Mike
McCurry said. ''It is an escalation of the conflict. There is likely to
be civilian casualties . . . We have urged the parties in this conflict
to avoid all of those things.''
Mr Perry, though, expressed limited support for the Croatian
offensive, saying it was partly aimed at stopping Serb attacks on Bihac.
Russia's chief negotiator in former Yugoslavia warned Nato against
military involvement saying it could trigger a major war in the Balkans.
Mr Alexander Zotov told Interfax news agency any Nato action ''could
lead to a complete loss of control over the situation in the region and
in fact could become an invitation to a broader war''.
Russia had earlier issued a tough statement condemning Croatia's
offensive. -- Reuter/AP.

ANYONE who doubts the reports that the Scottish housing market is dead
need only consider that in recent years mortgage tax relief has been
reduced, ''negative equity'' is a fact of life for many first-time
buyers, the Government has reduced the amount of support to pay mortgage
interest in the event of redundancy, and repossessions are commonplace.
For those with grown-up families, ownership of a smaller house can no
longer be called an investment -- the Community Care Act allows the
state to take it to pay for your nursing-home care.
The Government needs to reconsider its position on all of these before
the housing market can improve.

AUGUST is notoriously a wicked month, and events in Krajina are doing
nothing to demolish its reputation. It was in August 1914 that the First
World War began, sparked by events in the Balkans, and while history
does not repeat itself, it is doing so to this extent -- the Balkans in
August are once again the cause of a grave crisis threatening the peace
of Europe. Has out-and-out war in Croatia really begun at last? The UN
is in no doubt it has, and the world reacted with anger yesterday at the
massive Croat dawn assault against the rebel Serb capital of Knin in the
Krajina enclave. The condemnations duly rumbled forth from the capitals
of Europe, from Brussels, from the UN, and very tepidly from Washington,
but they remained nothing but words, words, words, more huffing and
puffing.
Will the two sides ever listen? Are we in a position to make them
listen? Do the combatants want to listen? Will President Milosevic of
Serbia intervene directly in the Croatian war, or will he stand back? It
would be foolish to forecast his reactions. He has said in the Belgrade
press that he does not intend to get involved, but in Yugoslavia today
nobody's word can be believed.
This time the villains of the piece are the Croats whose newly
equipped Army has been spoiling for a fight. Last time it was the Serbs.
Unlike the Bosnian Army it has not been severely affected by the arms
embargo since the import of weapons has been relatively easy for a
country with open borders. As for the Krajina Serbs, they are
battle-hardened to say the least. As far as both sides are concerned it
is up to the international community to find the answers to their
problems. The trouble is they do not want to have anything to do with
the answers put forward as the collapse of the latest round of talks in
Geneva shows. No-one has succeeded so far in taming the savagery of the
Bosnian Serbs, whose barbaric behaviour has been a disgrace to the age
we live in. The Croats have reason to fear the Serbs, which is possibly
why the initial condemnation yesterday was mild in tone. The Foreign
office statement, while strongly worded, was essentially a statement of
the obvious, unlikely to make the recipients shake in their shoes.
Britain rightly believes the solution lies through negotiation, because
it is the political vacuum left by the collapse of the former Yugoslavia
which has to be filled. It is complicated by other factors, religious
and racial, but it comes down in the end to creating political
structures which can work. Without muscle, however, it has so far got
nowhere and the decision to resort to air strikes was taken to lend a
little of that necessary clout. The danger is this latest fighting could
lead to the war spreading ever wider, to localised conflicts turning
into a full-scale Balkan war. More fighting, more deaths, more refugees,
this time headed outside the region -- it is an appalling prospect.
Pulling out the UN is always an option, although it could have
disastrous consequences. Lifting the arms embargo, ring fencing the
region -- if it can be done -- and letting the two sides get on with the
killing is tempting, but not practicable. All we can do is hope: hope
that the Croats and the Serbs will see sense, that the gangsters running
the respective shows will be overthrown by the people they are
exploiting, and that the EU negotiators, Carl Bildt and Thorvald
Stoltenberg, and those who negotiate for the Contact Group can finally
come up with something the two sides will accept.

NICK Faldo, facing the ignominious prospect of missing the cut, dug
deep and came up with a four-under-par 68 in the second round at the
$1.2m Buick Open in Grand Blanc, Michigan, yesterday.
Faldo was equal 105th after a mediocre opening round even-par 72, but
he responded to the challenge in benign conditions on the Warwick Hills
course.
''It was one extreme to the other,'' said Faldo, relieved his
four-under 140 halfway total would be good enough to make the cut.
However, he was 10 strokes behind Payne Stewart, who shot a second
successive seven-under 65. Leading scores (American unless stated):
130 -- Payne Stewart 65, 65.
131 -- Woody Austin 63, 68.
134 -- Jim Furyk 72, 62; JL Lewis 65, 69; Bruce Vaughan 65, 69.
135 -- Brad Bryant 68, 67; Mike Brisky 67, 68.
136 -- Russ Cochran 66, 70; Tom Byrum 69, 67; Tony Sills 69, 67; Mark
Wurtz 71, 65; Jonathan Kaye 69. 67.
Other scores included: 139 -- Scott Hoch 69, 70; Tom Kite 72, 67. 140
-- Nick Faldo (England) 72, 68.

Zagreb's military gamble in Krajina could also radically change the
map of Bosnia.THE conflict in the former Yugoslavia has rarely appeared
as baffling as now. Attention suddenly veers from Bosnia to the Krajina,
a crescent-shaped piece of land wedged between Croatia and Bosnian Serb
territory.
Croatia, which has been tempting unwary tourists to its Dalmatian
resorts by saying that all is normal again, suddenly goes to war. Serbs,
whom the world has grown used to seeing as military victors, lose
territory and thousands of refugees take to the roads.
Meanwhile, in Belgrade, Slobodan Milosevic, the hard-line communist
who used Serbian nationalism to accomplish the break-up of Yugoslavia,
sits tight while his Serb brethren taste the bitter fruits of defeat.
However it may just be that some order is entering the political and
military chaos of the former Yugoslavia and that, provided there is a
decisive outcome to the latest fighting, the battle lines will become
far simpler.
Croat-Serb confrontation is easy to understand. It has a history
stretching back 80 years when rival visions of what kind of state
Yugoslavia should be placed its two main peoples at loggerheads. For
most of the time, disputes between these fellow South Slavs, united by
language and shared ancestry but placed apart by religion and
contrasting political experience, were the main ones in Yugoslavia after
its creation in 1918.
In 1990, following the election of Croat nationalist Franjo Tudjman,
10 areas of Croatia where Serbs were in a majority declared an
''autonomous region of Krajina''. Rural Serbs, whose elders had been the
victims of Croat extremists in the early 1940s, saw no future for
themselves in an independent Croatia.
Their successionist moves were choreographed in Belgrade by Slobodan
Milosevic, whose attempts to centralise Yugoslavia around a Serbian core
were pushing Slovenia and Croatia towards independence.
The stubborn highlanders, living in the valleys around the bleak
railway junction of Knin, overlooking the Dalmatian coast, had fought
for the Hapsburgs against the Ottoman Turks and played a
disproportionate role in the Yugoslav army.
High on nationalism, Croat's President Tudjman made little effort to
reconcile them. However even if he had offered them full autonomy before
the war started, it is unlikely that they would have been won round to
rule from Zagreb.
In the Croatian ''war of independence'' fought between August 1991 and
January 1992, rebel Serbs seized one-third of Croatia. The wonder is
that much more was not overrun: the fledgling Croat state had a rag-tag
army and few arms thanks to the weapons embargo imposed by the UN on
former Yugoslavia.
In 1992, the Krajina Serbs acceded to a UN ceasefire on the
instructions of Belgrade. Milosevic has been able to control his fellow
nationalist Serbs in Croatia more easily than in Bosnia. Economic
sanctions on Serbia were already starting to bite.
The Krajina Serbs have 40,000 troops along with several hundred tanks,
500 artillery pieces, and up to 15 aircraft. They have been ready to
shell Croatian cities outside the war zone, as happened this spring when
the Croats grabbed back a chunk of their lost territory in western
Slavonia.
In the last three years, however, the elan of the Krajina Serbs has
been dissipated by black-marketeering which even involved selling guns
to Muslims in Bosnia. What military action they have seen has mainly
been alongside their Serb brethren in Bosnia. Radovan Karadzic, from his
headquarters in Pale, deploys 80,000 troops, 330 tanks, and 800
artillery pieces along with 30 or so aircraft, but the Bosnian Serb
forces are badly overstretched in the 70% of Bosnia they now control.
They are confronted by a Bosnian government force of 110,000 men and 40
tanks which made limited gains last year despite a shortage of heavy
weapons.
The initiative began to switch to the Muslim-led Sarajevo government
as it began to co-operate with Bosnian Croats, with whom it had been in
conflict in 1993-94. The Bosnian Croats claimed 50,000 troops, 75
aircraft, and 200 artillery pieces, yet had made little headway in
fighting against the Bosnian government side. A Muslim-Croat
confederation in Bosnia, brokered by the Americans last year, later
paved the way for joint action against the Bosnian Serbs.
Just before the serious fighting in Krajina, attention had focused on
the Bihac pocket in north-east Bosnia. Krajina and Bosnian Serbs had
been trying to overrun this mainly Muslim area, which could then have
enabled all the rebel Serb areas to be physically united. To confound
the impression that this was a religious war, they had the backing of
some renegade Muslims led by Fikrit Abdic, an economic fixer from
communist times.
The number of contestants for land in Bosnia and Serb-controlled
Croatia and their shifting allegiances seems a recipe for endless
confusion and strife.
What might transform the situation is the emergence of a much
better-trained and equipped Croatian Army under a president determined
to retire as head of a united Croatia. Tudjman's force has secretly
bought planes and attack helicopters on the East European arms market
and shipped them back in bits before re-assembling them in Croatia. One
hundred thousand regular troops are massed around Krajina with 100,000
reservists on standby.
Time will quickly tell if President Tudjman's military gamble succeeds
in joining Krajina with Croatia proper. The Krajina Serbs are surrounded
on three sides and, if their bastion is stormed, the defenders of
Sarajevo and Bihac will find it easier to turn their forces against the
Bosnian Serbs.
Perhaps the military map in Bosnia will also radically alter, but
nothing has been that simple in the four-year war of the Yugoslav
succession.
How President Milosevic in Serbia reacts is likely to be the critical
factor. In public, he affects a post-nationalist air in order to speed
the lifting of economic sanctions on Serbia. However it was he who
promoted Serb successionists in Croat and Bosnia, and he cannot easily
neutralise Serb power-brokers like Radovan Karadzic and General Mladic,
the butcher of Srebrenica.
What may have prompted the Croat assault on Krajina now is the arrival
some months ago of 50 top officers from the Yugoslav army whose task was
to knock the slack Krajina militia back into shape. But Milosevic's own
army is not the force it used to be, with far more resources being
lavished on the police in order to foil any power-grab by a rival.
As usual, the international community is a bystander, reacting to,
rather than anticipating, events. It is not clear whether countries like
Germany and Britain are putting pressure on Tudjman to honour his pledge
not to mistreat civilian Serbs in the path of his advancing armies.The
key test of the authority of the European powers will be if they can
prevent Tudjman from doing a deal with Milosevic to partition Bosnia
between Serbia and Croatia, something that was tried before and could be
resurrected again.

AN afternoon in the sun with a few cooling drinks for good measure,
sounds good, does it not, and at Ayr this afternoon the only ingredient
required for a perfect afternoon is, of course, a few winners.
The opening two expected favourites probably should not be opposed.
John Dunlop's Beauchamp King ran as though he had little knowledge of
what was going on when third at Kempton, and has to have come on for
that experience, while 30 minutes later, Summer Villa looks one for the
popular trainer, Patrick Haslam.
After the third, well, it gets a little more tricky.
Linda Perratt has had better seasons but the local trainer's
Celebration Cake could be good enough for the mile race. For those who,
by now, may be in need of a bolt from the blue for some help with funds,
Donal Nolan's Uppance, with just 7st 2lb to carry, just could be the
answer to put the bookies in their place.

NED'S Bonanza can defy top weight and land Ayr's big race, the Star
Form Handicap this afternoon. The son of Stewards Cup winner Green Ruby
may lack his father's class but has held form well over his preferred
six furlongs this season.
A return to his peak was signalled by his performance at Thirsk last
week when he proved too strong for Benzoe, and the 5lb rise seems within
his scope.
Veteran campaigner Diet, a winner last time out, should prove the best
of Linda Perratt's three runners.
Beauchamp King was made favourite for his debut at Kempton in June but
disappointed his many backers by finishing third in a field of eight. He
showed more promise than that run might suggest, however, and should
have come on sufficiently to take the opener.
Despite three good runs in top company, Derby fourth Fahal has yet to
prove his worth, but Haydock's Rose of Lancaster Stakes looks a suitable
medium in which to do it. Having hit the front too soon at Epsom, he
showed guts to keep running on and should be better suited by today's 10
furlongs.
In his last race over this distance he finished within a length of
Pentire, who got so close to Lammtarra at Ascot. Fahal now can enjoy his
first win of the season, at the main expense of Revere.
Gorinsky seems to be coming to hand and is now 17lbs lower in the
handicap than this time last year. He can take this chance to score in
the Coral Handicap, a race he won two years ago.
Bint Salsabil is the daughter of Hamdam Al Maktoum's Derby-winning
pair Nashwan and Salsabil, so it would be easy to get carried away about
her prospects. Even so, the slightest improvement on her debut run
should put her comfortably ahead of her rivals in Newmarket's Sweet
Solera Stakes.
* MOST people like a happy ending, and Uttoxeter trainer Tony Forbes'
last runner of the Flat, Mad Militant, made sure that he left Southwell
with a smile yesterday when winning the second division of the claimer.
Forbes, who relinquishes his licence in the next few days, will be
represented for the final time over jumps at Worcester before handing
over control of his 12-horse stable to Andy Streeter.
The race was not without incident, and jockey Simon Yim ended up in
front of the stewards for his use of the whip on the runner up, Shared
Risk. After having viewed the video evidence of the race, they found him
guilty of using his whip with unusual frequency and suspended him for
two days -- August 13 and 14.

COMBINING a fixed-interest investment with a holding of warrants has a
certain appeal. The fixed-interest portion gives an income and the
warrants spice the whole thing up with the prospect of capital gains.
When the Framlington Group offered the mixture in a new investment
trust, the Throgmorton Preferred Income Trust, in November 1993, it was
sufficiently attractive to bring in cheques for the #60m worth of shares
on offer. A total of #75m worth could have been sold.
The money raised was to invest in smaller companies, which now
includes those quoted on the Alternative Investment Market. ''There are
some 3000, of which around 700 would be a fit for us,'' says David
Hughes, the trust's investment manager.
The new trust was designed to provide small and growing companies with
a source of finance alternative to going to a bank or mounting a rights
issue. Mr Hughes recalls that although there were signs of recovery at
the time it was floated, the recession was still quite deep and smaller
companies were experiencing difficulties in getting finance on
acceptable terms. The target was to fill what it saw as a financing gap
on terms which would be attractive to companies.
It offers a package of up to #3m to be invested in redeemable
Preference shares, currently carrying interest of 7[1/2]% to 9%, plus
warrants entitling the trust to subscribe for Ordinary shares. Exercise
price for the warrants is usually pitched at 10% over the market price
at the time of the Preference share subscription, and the trust takes a
sufficient number of warrants to enable it to subscribe a sum equal to a
third of its investment in Preference shares.
''A rights issue is made at a discount but warrants are normally
priced at a premium,'' Mr Hughes points out. The trust aims to exercise
the subscription right within four to six years. It will then sell the
shares bought in this way. ''We are not an equity trust,'' he stresses.
It has so far invested around half its capital in Preference shares of
11 companies, with another #30m still to spend, and has warrants
entitling it to subscribe to some #10m in Ordinary shares. Around half
the warrants are already in the money, in that if they were exercised
now the shares subscribed for could be sold at a profit.
The trust itself has a limited life, being due for wind up in 2001. By
then it hopes to have achieved a total return of 15% to 20%. Its recent
interim statement said its first 10 Preference share investments were
generating an average gross yield of 10.6%.
Mr Hughes says his Preference shares plus warrants package is cost
effective for the company seeking cash. Raising #3m in this way is
likely to involve expenses of around #50,000 which, he points out, is
cheaper than a small rights issue.
With getting on for 20 years of experience with 3i before he joined
the trust, he reckons to arrive quickly at decisions on whether or not
to make an investment. ''Three deals were done in 10 days,'' he says.
''We can move remarkably quickly.''
A number of investments have been made in conjunction with rights
issues. ''We can come in on our own or join a rights issue or a
placing,'' he says. Although the initial build up of investments has
been slower than originally hoped, there has been plenty of interest. A
number of deals are currently being worked on and three more could be
agreed next month. ''There are a lot of conversations going on,'' say Mr
Hughes and colleague Julia Curphey. ''Activity is building up as
companies come out of the recession.
''Acquisition is the most popular reason for seeking our finance.
Small quoted companies are buying private companies which have held back
from selling during the recession. There is probably a backlog of
private companies willing to sell.''
He is confident the AIM will be successful. ''It will do quite
nicely,'' he predicts. ''In 12 to 18 months it will have built up
credibility and justified the faith placed in it.''
The trust expects to have put money into 25 to 30 companies by the
time it is fully invested. Current investments range from Hawtal
Whiting, an automotive design consultant whose warrants are already in
the money, to Martin International, manufacturer of lingerie and
knitwear. Once the #60m is invested Mr Hughes would like to launch
another trust operating on the same formula. Backing smaller companies
puts it in the risk business, but it has the potential to recoup losses
with profits on warrants. And, as he remarks: ''If the market booms we
should make a lot of money.''
The trust's shares stand at a discount of more than 9% and give a
yield of getting on for 8%. When the new PEP rules come into effect its
shares should be PEPable, a privilege so far denied because of its heavy
involvement in Preference shares.
Comfortingly, NatWest Securities is currently looking with approval on
the small company scene. It notes that the SmallCap index has begun to
out-perform, recent results from smaller company investment trusts have
been good, and earnings growth is expected to be 16% for the sector as a
whole. ''We view the smaller company trust sector as a geared play on
the UK market,'' it says. And with the Tory leadership contest settled
and political uncertainty reduced, it considers the UK ''looks set for a
period of economic stability''.
The firm's global economic strategists say that the underlying
economic fundamentals ''remain encouraging''. They do not think the UK
or the US are heading for recession and also see inflation, domestic and
international, as under control. They recommend a number of trusts
investing in the Ordinary shares of smaller companies including
Amicable, Fleming Mercantile, Invesco English and International, and TR
Smaller Companies, all standing at discounts.

THIS week the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society finally became
part of Lloyds Bank. C&amp;G investors are set to share a massive #1.8bn
payout from Lloyds Bank, with payments of up to #13,200, with the
average investor set to receive #2000.
There are rich pickings to be had from backing the next building
society to find itself a takeover target or to abandon mutual status for
the bright lights and executive perks of becoming a bank with shares
quoted on the stock market.
Building societies are undergoing big structural changes which are
likely to see a dramatic shrinkage in their number before the turn of
the century. The two big mergers and takeovers which are currently
affecting the 11.2 million investors in the Halifax, Leeds Permanent and
National &amp; Provincial building societies are unlikely to be the last.
The Halifax and the Leeds Permanent merged this week and are now
moving towards a stock market flotation in early 1997 when investors in
both societies are set to receive shares worth between #500 and #800.
And three weeks ago, the National &amp; Provincial finally agreed to be
taken over by the Abbey National in a move which is likely to reward its
investors by at least #500 in shares or cash.
Supporters of the concept of mutuality, which was the norm until the
Abbey National broke ranks and went public six years ago, will be
disappointed. Mutual ownership has served building society savers and
borrowers well, and there isn't any evidence that it has actually
hampered their development. However, there is now a widely held view
within the industry that critical mass is everything, unless there is a
profitable niche to be exploited, and that size somehow demands that
building societies should abandon 100 years of tradition and convert to
public companies.
Some building societies continue to profess their belief in mutuality.
The Bradford &amp; Bingley is generally thought to be sincere when it
professes its continued commitment to this form of ownership and the
Portman has recently said it has no intention of abandoning the faith.
So which societies are most likely to fall and which will pay their
investors the biggest amount? The best bet are societies with a high
proportion of large investors. These are likely to yield the highest
return for an investment of just #100. A recent survey by stockbrokers
UBS shows that the Yorkshire Building Society with an estimated market
value of #700m and just 610,000 voting members could attract a payout of
#1147 on an investment of #100.
The estimate for other leading building societies varies between #450
and #800. The Nationwide is now the biggest society not to have fallen.
It had takeover talks with the N&amp;P and is keeping its options open on
conversion.
The Woolwich is known to be considering a number of options including
increasing its geographic area beyond its South of England heartland. A
merger with the Bradford &amp; Bingley was on the cards at one stage. Other
possibilities include a merger and possible conversion with another
northern or midlands based society.
There is one other point to bear in mind when opening an account with
any of these building societies. Make sure that you are putting your
money into an account which qualifies you for membership of the society.
Most instant access accounts are fine, but don't assume that every
account gives you the right to pick up one of these cash or share
handouts.

THE inevitable outcry after a modern Test match had at least one
unusual feature at Old Trafford earlier this week -- it came from the
victorious side.
Robin Smith was vociferous in his objections and having been out there
in the middle, he was very much entitled to be so.
The West Indians met unwonted English batting resistance, lost their
cool, and for a time their bowling was intimidatory, as umpire Dickie
Bird correctly ruled. Nothing strange about that. Fast bowlers are a
notoriously petulant breed.
But -- we can now officially use but as an opener -- let us ''pause
and consudder'' as Para Handy was wont to say. Let us try and put on one
side for the moment the West Indian Ravenscraig from which Constantine
and Martindale emerged in the 1930s, Hall and Griffith in the 1960s,
Roberts, Holding, Garner and Marshall in the 1970s, and in our own days
Walsh, Ambrose and Bishop.
It is in the nature of the defeated to blame fast bowlers. When
Pakistani bowlers Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis were wreaking havoc with
the English it was because they had hellish Oriental arts which enabled
them to pitch the ball up and make it move late.
When we occasionally produce genuine fast bowlers -- we don't do so
very often partly because of climatic conditions and partly because no
really fast bowler can sustain a county season -- we, let me speak for
England here, do not scruple to use them.
Never mind Larwood and Voce, think of Tyson and dear old Fred Trueman,
who will lovably tell you of how the Indian batsmen were answering calls
of nature out in the middle as he pinged it around their ears in the
happy days when caviare was four pence a ton. I seem to remember also
that Bob Willis provoked some considerable Aussie crowd trouble 20 years
on from that.
Bowlers always believe the world was created for batsmen, and in some
respects, they are right. Batsmen faced Larwood and Voce bare-headed, or
justcapped, with rudimentary batting gloves and even more rudimentary
boxes. The first batsman to wear a helmet in county cricket did not do
so until the early 1970s when the general crowd reaction was one of
derision. Now there are, as there should be, good protectors for thighs
and chest.
But -- and that's my two for the over -- what about the injuries to
hands?
As it happens, there is a basket-hilted bat in production which would
largely eliminate injuries to fingers and I would be interested to hear
why the cricket authorities have been in no great hurry to legitimise
it.
Larwood, Trueman, Malcolm Marshall, none of them a six-footer, are the
exceptions in modern cricket. Curtly Ambrose and Ian Bishop are
literally a foot taller than any of them. The trajectory of the ball is
different. Joel Garner was not especially fast but with the ball coming
down from around 10 feet, the batsman was continually playing off his
throat.
A point worth noting is that we play on the 22-yard pitch which was
designed originally for underarm bowling at less than half today's top
speed. The option of making the pitch longer is not open because batsmen
could not run quick singles over 26 yards or so. By some magic formula,
22 yards is just right for that.
Should then, tail-enders -- say 9, 10 and jack -- be exempt from
short-pitched bowling?
No. Nowadays, most lower-order batsmen are at least competent, and if
allowed to prod forward in the knowledge that nothing is coming down
short, they may hang around long enough to win, or even save the match.
I know of only two non-batting No.11s in the present English county
championship.
Back to the short pitched stuff, and nobody even suggesting that
batsmen should stop hooking or pulling if there is a close leg-side
fielder.
Such bowling must be controlled, not so much because it is dangerous
as because it is dull, and at the end of the day, a cheat on the crowd
and the opposition.
I am aware of Clive Lloyd's brilliant riposte to complaints about the
funereal West Indies' over rate: ''You mean we should bowl our overs
faster and win the match in two days?''
But it won't do.
To profess inability to bowl 90 overs in a day is to short-change the
public, a walk back to the mark at more than the pace of a glacier does
it. Moreover, by reducing the number of overs bowled, it automatically
follows that the chances of the opposition winning are diminished since
you cannot make runs unless a ball is bowled to you.
I do not in any sense blame the West Indies in isolation. Only on
Thursday, one of their batsmen, Jimmy Adams, was carted off to hospital
after having been hit in the face by a short-pitched delivery from
Somerset paceman Andre Van Troost at Taunton. The result was a cracked
cheekbone and surgery to repair the damage.
The answer is to back umpires when they intervene, and to punish
persistent infringements by a penalty of four runs per ball. That would
concentrate hearts and minds wonderfully.
The best hope is the realisation that spin should be fostered -- not
for sentimental reasons, but because in recent times, it is seen to
work.
Fast bowling is thrilling, but so too are the wiles of Shane Warne and
Mushtaq Ahmed, neither of whom would invoke the indignant cry once heard
at Scarborough during a fast bowler's interminable run-up
''Hey-up, Lever, ah doan't go as far for me bloody holidays.''

ON Monday night the committee at Berwick rugby club will meet to ask
themselves how they will approach the SRU over a little matter that is
troubling them.
There was a gasp of disbelief when the draw for the new Scottish Cup
was announced. Berwick, actually in England, found themselves drawn
against Lochaber, who are just about as far away from anywhere in the
other direction. The SRU will be asked to contribute. I find that this
episode brilliantly shows just how club rugby has changed.
''We couldn't believe it,'' said Berwick fixture secretary David
Budzynski. ''It's a round trip of something like 400 miles for us.
''Then, the following week, we have to travel to Inverness. It is
going to cost us #400 to hire a bus, and although we will get #400 as
our payment to take part in the match, we will make nothing.''
Berwick have just spent #200,000 in reconstructing their club house,
and therefore cash is at a premium. ''When we meet we will probably
decide to ask the SRU for something to help us take part,'' he says. ''I
think that the first two or three rounds of the tournament should be
localised. We could really have done without this.''
Notice that the club will lose no money, but want to be paid more to
take part in the competition so that they do. It won't be for love, it
will be for money.
In this country we think that a three-hour drive is something
tortuous. In South Africa they sometimes take that long to drive to the
nearest shops. And I thought that all of the clubs in Scotland wanted
the chance to get into a big, country wide, knock-out competition.
There is a vast difference between wanting to play for the cultural
exchange, and wanting paid to play -- even if you are a club. I have
much more sympathy with the island clubs like Mull and Orkney who, on
the odd occasion, have to rely on the fishing industry, or a risk taker
with a pilot's license, to get them home when the last ferry has sailed.
But I won't say that it's a wholly bad attitude from Berwick, perhaps
they have troubled times, but what I will say is that it just shows you
how clubs are now thinking. It's all about sponsorship, it's all about a
wee drop of cash for a trainer, and it's all about keeping the bank
manager happy. It's getting more and more commercial.
Which makes me wonder how the SRU will get their district rugby to
mean more to the average club member than his or her beloved club does
at the moment. You know my views. Clubs are vital, but the vast majority
of club players -- if you cut them in half, torture them, and ask them
what they really believe -- don't want much more than to play a few
games and train twice a week. And that applies to most levels.
The main driving force at most clubs is their membership, who want the
place to be successful, because that means that the sponsorship comes
in, the players are happy, and the bank manager is too. The members are
desperate for success for their own little patch.
And you can almost sense that they are loathe to divert their
attention into anything else, like their district for example,
especially when that attention could bear fruit for that body at the
expense of the club.
It's a whole cultural identity, I think, that explains how there were
more district committee men at some of the games with the Irish
provinces last year than there were spectators.
You can see it in Glasgow, too. All that population, more rugby clubs
and rugby players than the rest of Scotland put together, and yet no-one
out to watch the district.
Time will tell whether Berwick are right or wrong to ask for the
silver dollar to take part in the cup. Time will also tell whether club,
or district, will become the dominant force in our domestic scene.

IF you are enjoying the long hot summer, you may be tempted to
consider moving abroad to live and work. Indeed more people spend some
part of their working life abroad. If you are considering leaving the
UK, tax is an issue that you should review seriously.
It is a common myth that you avoid tax by going abroad. It is less
commonly known that by getting your arrangements wrong, you can in fact
increase your tax bill.
It must be remembered that few parts of the world do not have their
own tax system. If you are moving to a new country always start by
finding out about the local tax system. Each country is different, but
common rules to look for are that you will be liable to tax in that
country if you spend more than 183 days in the tax year.
Each country has its own tax year, which is often the calendar year
and different from the UK's year ending on April 5. Owning property is
another common trigger for rendering you liable to foreign tax.
Penalties for non-compliance with local tax systems also vary widely
and are often harsher than the UK. If you are liable for tax in the
country you have moved to, it will often be your world-wide income that
is taxed and not just income arising in the new country. It can often
pay to take advice on how legitimately to structure your affairs so as
to avoid tax before you arrive -- if you wait until you get there it can
sometimes be too late.
From a UK perspective, you remain liable to UK tax unless you cease to
be resident and ordinarily resident in the UK. The term residence for
this purpose has a special meaning, and it is important to be able to
understand this element of tax jargon as otherwise you could easily be
misled to your position.
Under the Inland Revenue's Code of Practice, you are classed as UK
resident if you are physically present here for more than 183 days in
the year to April 5. If you have always lived in the UK, in order to
lose your UK residence you must be able to demonstrate that you have
gone abroad for more than just a temporary purpose.
That period must include a complete tax year of absence from the UK
and must be for a minimum period of three years unless you are taking up
employment abroad. Furthermore any visits you then make back to the UK
must not exceed an average of more than 90 days measured over a four
year period.
If you are going abroad to work, becoming non-resident is quicker and,
providing your employment lasts a complete tax year and your visits to
the UK are within the limits specified above you will be regarded as
non-resident from the day after your departure from the UK. If you
change employer be careful this does not affect your residence position.
Remember too that you can only become non-resident after one tax year if
you are employed -- if set up in business as self-employed the normal
three-year rules applies.
Once you are non-resident you are generally not liable to tax on your
earnings abroad. Other income arising in the UK may still be liable to
tax. Typically this may include bank or building society interest. You
should register to have such interest paid gross from when you become
non-resident. This is because by concession the Inland Revenue will not
then tax such interest whereas if tax continues to be deducted at source
you may not be in a position to recover it as it remains UK taxable.
The concession does not apply to interest arising in the year you
leave the UK so if you know you are going abroad it can be good idea to
switch your accounts offshore, perhaps to the Channel Islands or Isle of
Man, even before you leave. If you have a TESSA, becoming non-resident
does not affect your right to keep the account or to receive the
interest tax free but remember the tax exemption may not apply to your
new country of residence.
This also applies to other tax sheltered investments. For example if
you have a personal equity plan you can keep it but you cannot pay any
further subscriptions into it. If you contribute by monthly subscription
you must tell the plan manager of your new status immediately.
You will also need to consider carefully whether there is any benefit
in retaining such an investment. Specifically if you are not resident
and not ordinarily resident you are not liable to capital gains tax when
you sell investments so the capital gains tax exemption of the PEP is of
no benefit. If you plan to return to the UK in future, however, it may
be worth keeping this type of investment and you should discuss the
benefits and costs with your investment adviser.
While the exemption from capital gains tax is usually good news
sometimes there can be a catch. If you have received a gift from someone
in the past and they have elected to hold over the gain so that they did
not pay capital gains tax but their gain was deducted from the market
value of the asset at which you were deemed to acquire it, the gain
could crystallise if you become non-resident.
This rule applies if you become non-resident within six years of the
tax year in which you received the gift unless the only reason you have
become non-resident is that you have taken up employment abroad. In this
case, provided you become UK resident again within three years without
having disposed of the asset, the tax relief can be retained. Otherwise
you become liable to tax on the capital gain deferred and if you don't
pay the tax due the Inland Revenue can recover it from the person who
made the gift.
If you have investments, take the time to review the UK tax position
on them before you leave and take advice again before you return. Often
significant tax savings can be achieved by switching to a different type
of investment or by relocating it and the timing of any disposal and
reacquisition can be crucial.
Lastly make sure your decision to move abroad is for the right reason
and not just to avoid tax. Tax savings are rarely worth adopting a
lifestyle you find difficult to live with, and sometimes the apparent UK
benefit can be swallowed up in the increased cost of living abroad or in
unexpected local taxes. It pays to do your homework in this area
thoroughly before making the move.

DISCO music tortured the still, warm night air, blasting out over the
competitors' village at the World Athletics Championship earlier this
week. Suddenly, a voice bellowed from a window in the British quarters:
''John, can you no' do something about that music.''
It was well before midnight, and Liz McColgan's request was beyond the
negotiating skills of John Brown, the Scottish administrator to the UK
team in Gothenburg. Entertainment is a rare commodity here, but what
exists is protected.
The McColgan of earlier years would have struck camp and checked into
a decent hotel. But the former double Commonwealth 10,000 metres
champion is a different animal these days -- more easy-going, less
intense, less brashly confident. She stayed put, and was soon asleep.
Mercifully, the entertainment finished at midnight.
Facilities in the athletes' village are spartan. They are housed in
temporary structures laid out in a city centre park.
There is not a lot to occupy the competitors, who must have known the
host city was no gold-medal contender in the entertainment stakes when
the in-flight magazine on the plane to here extolled its virtues thus:
''The quayside fish auctions start at 7.0am sharp, as they always have.
And the screeching expectant seagulls are always there. . . it's fun to
watch, and worth losing some sleep to get there.''
The fish market might solve a problem for Melanie Neef this morning.
She is the first British athlete in action, at 8.30, UK time.
''I plan to be up before six, so that my body is functioning,'' she
said. This is a real culture shock. You think of a championship with
packed stands, and intimidating atmosphere. But the stadium will be
empty at that hour. Training at deserted Livingston has had its uses
after all.''
Neef's target is a place in the 400 metres final. ''I think it will
take below 51 seconds, which would mean a Scottish record (51.16sec).''
When Fife's Lindsey Macdonald recorded that time in 1980, aged 16, it
took her to the Moscow Olympics, and a final berth alongside East
European Amazons, most of whom would have been more appropriate in a
body-building contest.
Bob Inglis, Neef's coach, believes 50.5 to be ''just about the limit
of non-steroid performance. The sport is cleaner than it was. Mel would
not have had a chance of making a world final 10 years ago.''
McColgan has no doubts of her ability to produce optimum performance
in hot conditions. Four years ago, she covered 25 laps in the steamy
heat of Tokyo to capture the world 10,000m title. But that was a
different McColgan.
Injuries which would have destroyed a more fragile mind and body have
intruded. ''I am reconciled never to run pain-free again,'' she says.
''But I am here, as fit as it is humanly possible for me to be. I have
worked damned hard, and I'm looking forward to racing.''
It will be only her third track race since the Barcelona Olympics
when, less than a year after her world triumph, followed by the world's
fastest debut marathon, she finished a broken fifth, an undetected and
potentially fatal iron deficiency working on her.
Then came the injuries. ''Yes, there were times when I thought my
career was over.'' But last month, in a 5000m race behind world
record-breaking Fernanda Ribiero, McColgan ran faster than she had ever
done.
She is scheduled toline up in the Ullevi stadium tomorrow in the
heats, with the final on Wednesday. She will stand with her ambitions
rekindled for a race which promises to be not just one of the best of
the championships, but the greatest assembly of female endurance talent
ever seen on a track.
Ribiero will be joined by fellow Portuguese Albertina Diaz and
Maria-Conceicao Ferreira. Diaz is a former world cross-country champion,
while Ferriera was last year's European 10,000m silver medallist.
The Olympic 10,000m and reigning world cross-country champion, Derartu
Tulu, is here. The Ethiopian was runner-up to McColgan in Tokio.
Also in the field is Olympic runner-up Elana Meyer, of South Africa;
world junior cross-country champion Annemari Sandell of Finland;
Germany's Utta Pippig, the world's third fastest marathoner; New York
marathon winner Tecla Lorupe, and former world junior record holder
Delilah Asiago, both Kenyans; three-times world cross-country champion
Lynn Jennings of the USA. And Scotland's Yvonne Murray.
Ah, yes. Murray. The woman crowned Commonwealth queen after McColgan's
double reign, and who beat Meyer into second place at last year's Games
in Victoria.
Murray seems fated to run in McColgan's shadow, yet the competitive
record against her country-woman tells another story.
The pair have met on track 14 times between 1985 and 1992. Remarkably,
for all McColgan's formidable reputation, only once has Murray lost --
in July 1985 over 3000m at Birmingham. The world final here, barring an
unthinkable disaster in tomorrow's heats, will be their fifteenth track
meeting, but their first at 10,000 metres.
There is mutual respect, flashes of humour -- even jokes about boxing
gloves when the pair are asked to pose together. But there have been too
many elbow jousts on road and track, and angry outbursts, for anyone to
be deluded. ''We are rivals,'' says Murray.
Tulu dismisses both her Scottish rivals, despite McColgan having blown
her away on that memorable humid Tokyo night four years ago. ''Leez?
Yes, I know Leez. But this Murray, I had never heard of her before I
raced her at Portsmouth earlier this summer.''
Tulu, her name tattooed on the back of her left hand, and a tribal
tattoo around the wrist, smiled disarmingly. If it comes to a final-lap
sprint, the Ethiopian prison officer knows only she can be the winner.
Meyer would dearly love to record a win over Murray. She speaks
bitterly of their Commonwealth run: ''She has pretty sharp elbows.''
Meyer threatened to turn her ambitions to the marathon after the
Chinese re-wrote the record books two years ago, the truth of their
talent shrouded in oriental mystery amid tales of caterpillar fungus and
turtle meat.
But with ''Ma's Army'' disbanded, the Chinese even more intruigingly
have reverted to tortoises on the track. Meyer now says she may stay to
challenge Murray in her stated intention of doing the 10,000m next year
in Atlanta.
Not one of the Chinese who stunned the world two years ago in
Stuttgart is here. Having split with their controversial coach, Ma
Junren -- who made them run a marathon a day in training -- most could
not even qualify for the finals of their national championships.
That is of comfort to two other Scots, Trudi Thomson, of Pitreavie,
and Alison Rose (Edinburgh Woollen Mill), who race this morning in the
marathon.
But after all those miles in this heat, disco dancing may have to
wait. The fish market may be the limit of their energies.

TWO men were each jailed for three months after they admitted
assaulting an off-duty police inspector in a chip shop. Arthur
McNaughton, 32, and Clive Lyall, 28, who repeatedly punched Inspector
Morris Blair, were sentenced at Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday.
Alexander Moffat, 30, of Buckie Road, Mayfield, Dalkeith, who admitted a

Straw hats, essential for a ladylike existence in genteel nineteenth
century Britain, are becoming essential kit again, says LESLEY DUNCAN
IT may not be a truth universally acknowledged, but the deleterious
effects of sun on human skin have been known for some time. In Pride and
Prejudice, Elizabeth Bennet is accused of being unladylike for having a
complexion exposed to the weather. And it was not just genteel
nineteenth-century women who avoided the sun.
A delightful little picture by Turner -- recently on show in an
exhibition of English watercolours at the Scottish National Gallery in
Edinburgh -- depicts two farm girls resting from their labours. Their
heads are encased in enormous straw bonnets that completely shade faces
and necks. This headgear would seem a bit excessive today, except
perhaps at Ascot. But there is a lot to be said for more modest straw
hats to protect delicate skin and hair from this year's
uncharacteristically hot weather.
I'm not in the market myself, having a raffish black chapeau with the
type of upcurved brim favoured by Greg Norman. It has accompanied me
everywhere from school sports fields to the souk in Marrakesh. In the
latter location I was puzzled by urchins greeting me with ''Ecossaise,
ecossaise!'' How remarkably percipient of them, I thought, until I
realised that the hat ribbon was emblazoned with a thistle and the
device ''Bell's Scottish Open.''
Since the event (or, rather, that version of it) is no more, the hat
is now, I suppose, a collector's item. It has been rendered
two-dimensional on various occasions but always springs back into shape
when stuffed with a wet towel. Golfers' straw hats -- in panama or this
bigger-brimmed style -- are surprisingly becoming to women as well as
men. Look out for them in professionals' shops.
Real panamas (evidently handwoven in Equador these days) are the
covetable genuine articles. Murdoch Jamieson of Henry Burton and Co Ltd
of Buchanan Street, Glasgow, explained some of their characteristics.
First, they come in rigid and non-rigid varieties. The non-rigid kind
really does roll up into a carrying tube. The trouble is it has a
central fold that sits high on the crown, rather than the conventional
dunt. With tube this panama costs #73. The rigid ones come with various
brim widths. My favourite -- oozing Hollywood style with its wide brim
and maroon ribbon -- cost a more modest #32.50. A straw boater (#52.50)
would suit punters of the river variety.
The mystery of head sizes was also revealed. The variations around the
figure 7 refer to the inch measurement from front to back of the crown
of a hat. The average man's size is 7[1/8], the average woman's slightly
smaller. This may be explained by men's fat-headedness, jokes Mr
Jamieson.
For something a bit more overtly feminine, the chain stores are the
place to shop. Marks and Spencer's have a range of one-size hats, which
all, remarkably, seem to fit. Natural straw in natural shades is the
fashionable material. One model has an upturned brim; another, in a
paler shade of natural, sports a deep crown. A raffia-style hat in beige
and pinky brown would appeal to teenagers. Prices range from #10 to #20.
British Home Stores has a large choice. One design with a broad
navy-blue straw brim and matching cloth crown -- a bit like a
traditional coolie hat -- caught my eye. And my head, too, when I tried
it on. An abundance of natural-coloured straw hats made up for this
disappointment. Several models had neat little upturned brims with
trimmings of various degrees of elaboration.
One, with a bunch of flowers nestling in white cloth at the back, cost
#20. Another -- my favourite this -- had a trimming of orange and white
flowers at the side and fitted snugly over the brow. A large-brimmed
model had a definitely piratical air -- just the thing for a Caribbean
cruise. A shiny little hat of viscose sat trigly -- but would it be as
cool as natural straw? Prices ranged, with sale reductions, from #6.66
to #20.
And the final straw -- soft denim or fabric hats may be the
fashionable choice for small girls but Mothercare offers a miniature
straw hat with turned-back brim and snappy bow for a modest #3.99.

Jimmy Reid argues against the trend in recent years to divorce
economics from politics in pursuit of sado-monetarist individualism and
finds support in the classical economic theory of Adam Smith
ADAM Smith was posthumously appointed and annointed a Thatcherite by
the Blessed Margaret. The lady boasts she is absolutely not for turning,
which means she is not for turning even if going the wrong way. Hardly a
scientific approach to life.
For Lady Thatcher, mere opinions were too supine. Her mind is
inhabited by beliefs and convictions. Those who lacked the strength of
character or native wit to see the indisputable wisdom of her ways were
wet or wimpish, or both. Some Tory parliamentarians, with lascivious
memories of an overbearing nanny who ruled their early years with an
iron rod of certitudes, fell at her feet. She, of course, walked over
them, and they seemed to enjoy the experience.
Adam Smith -- a Scot of independent mind -- would not have lasted a
week in her Cabinet. He was a scientist open to new information which
might prove him wrong, for this was better than continuing to be wrong.
He pursued truth that he knew couldn't be absolute, but would be
constantly modified, and amplified, by expanding knowledge and new
investigative skills.
In his introduction to The Wealth of Nations, he wrote: ''Political
economy considered as a branch of the science of a statesman or
legislator, proposes two distinct objects: first, to provide a plentiful
revenue or subsistence for the people, or, more properly, to enable them
to provide such revenue or subsistence for themselves; and, secondly, to
supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue sufficient for the
public services.''
His work was, therefore, dedicated to helping those in Government
fulfil their responsibilities, which he defined as providing the means
by which people could earn a living, and also secure for the state the
revenues by which the commonwealth could fund public services.
Political economy was, for him, a branch of political science. He was
a political economist who sought to understand the laws of economics so
that others might use them politically for the betterment of humankind.
He advocated laissez-faire capitalism against a backcloth of feudal
restraints on trade. He lived at a time when manufacturing was conducted
by a multitude of small-to-medium sized companies. Competition was real.
The emergence of big companies, monopolies, multinational, and
transnational companies lay in the future. He was a philosopher, a
sociologist, as well as a political economist.
Smith would have scorned those who argue that economics should be
depoliticised, as if it were possible to abstract economics from the
society of which it is part -- albeit an important part.
In times past, our universities abounded with professors of political
economy. Not so long ago political economists from universities were
consulted about economic matters by the media. Today the media consults
experts who work for big stockbrokers and merchant banks, and they're
introduced as economists, not political economists.
In fact, ''political'' mysteriously disappeared from political
economy. No-one knows how or why, it just happened. But nothing just
happens, not like that.
In the context of political economy, the word ''political'' derives
from politics as meaning the complex or aggregate of relationships of
people in society as a whole. If you divorce economics from these human
and social relationships, then economics become inhuman.
Karl Marx, like Adam Smith, was a political economist, and is as much
to blame for the crimes of those who used his name as Smith was for the
crude marketeers who purloined his, or the gentle Christ in whose name
dastardly deeds are done.
He was wrong in many respects, but his analyses of the market economy
are worthy of study. In his Critique of Political Economy he wrote:
''Man is in the most literal sense of the word a zoon politikon (Greek
for political or social animal), not only a social animal but an animal
which can develop into an individual only in society . . .''
Marx rejected as absurd the idea of an isolated man outside of society
possessing within himself the dynamic productive elements of society as
a whole, and called this, ''. . . as great an absurdity as the idea of
the development of language without individuals living together and
talking to one another''.
Smith would have agreed. All political economists agreed that
economics must explain how men make their living, and deal with the
production and distribution of the materials needed to live, including
food, shelter, clothing etc. It was generally agreed that man couldn't
live by bread alone, but that he also couldn't live without it.
The satisfaction of material needs was viewed as a liberating force
which would enable mankind to stand upright and look at the heavens --
as is right. Liberal democratic values could not have come from
societies in which men and women scrambled with noses to the ground in
search of sustenance for their families.
There was also wide agreement that from earliest times human beings
had worked together in order to live, and that the process by which we
produced goods to meet our needs was a social process. The social aspect
of the productive process has grown and got more complex as time goes
by. Today, the production of the most mundane objects involves the
co-operation of many.
The tin-opener in your kitchen started with the mining of ore; the ore
was then put on wagons or ships and transported to a mill to be refined
into the material prescribed by those who designed your tin-opener; the
raw material is transported to the factory where the tin-opener is made,
packaged, and transported to a shop near you. You bought it and took it
to your kitchen. But thousands were involved, directly and indirectly,
in the process of producing and getting this tin-opener to you. And far
from being costly, it costs much less than if produced by yourself, or
any individual or any small group of individuals.
The social character of production, distribution, and exchange was, in
a capitalist market economy, the property of private owners. Some argued
that this contradiction should be resolved by taking into social
ownership the processes through which wealth is created, and gearing
them to social need and not private greed. These people became known as
Socialists.
The others didn't argue a direct negative. Most suggested that
inevitably, as the productive processes got bigger and bigger, they
would lead to larger companies which guaranteed access for the public in
terms of share ownership. In other words, there would be open and wider
social accountability in public companies, underpinned by a legal
framework of company law, within which these companies would operate.
It didn't really work that way. Access to the ownership of shares in
public companies was determined by whether you had the money to purchase
shares, and the poor, by definition, had no money.
Many within the middle classes became small share owners, but there is
little evidence that their interest went beyond the rate of profit. Even
where shareholders did take up wider issues, the financial institutions
and the company apparatchiks generally saw them off. There was a recent
example of this at the annual general meeting of British Gas, where
small shareholders turned up to vote out company officials who had
awarded themselves share options and vast salary increases while closing
showrooms and sacking staff.
A majority voted to sack these officials. The financial institutions
which own big chunks of the equity had the power to override these
shareholders, and did so. It is worth noting that those who condemn the
block votes of trade unions are somehow less horrified by the block
votes of financial institutions.
In any case, political economists argued, Government, in a democracy,
would have to act on behalf of society as a whole, if the power of big
companies was used against the public good. Efforts were made throughout
the twentieth century to equip governments with the means by which they
could regulate the market economy for the public good.
The devastating impact of periodic capitalist recessions and slumps
made an overwhelming case for such regulation. These recessions were
unique. There was no historical precedent. People had starved in the
midst of droughts and natural disasters, but that millions should starve
in the midst of plenty was a new phenomenon.
It made capitalism look absurd. The slump of the 1930s was, for many,
the last straw. No-one could morally justify a socio-economic system
that produced such ludicrous injustices. Political economists sought a
solution. One man came close to providing this, John Maynard Keynes.
He advocated political intervention to try to regulate the market
economy, to smooth out its booms and slumps, and thereby avert
widespread suffering. If the economy was slithering into recession or
was in recession, he proposed public spending on public projects which
would permanently enrich the capital infrastructure of the nation.
At best, Keynesianism created jobs in the short term which could
stimulate an upturn in the economy, or stop the onset of recession, or
precipitate an earlier recovery from recession. At worst, it was an
economic drip-feed which helped keep the patient alive.
The American New Deal was largely based on Keynesian precepts.
Post-war Western Europe promised that never again would its citizens be
confronted with the economic ravages of the inter-war years which
destabilised society and became a major factor in the rise of Hitler,
and the drift to world war.
A new political and economic consensus emerged, influenced by
Keynesianism and Socialism. The main political parties in Western Europe
accepted as a function of government the creation of jobs and full
employment. They accepted minimum welfare provisions as the guaranteed
right of every citizen -- from the cradle to the grave -- thus giving
birth to the welfare state.
Enlightened Tories like Harold Macmillan and Rab Butler, sickened by
what they saw in the 1930s, were willing partners in this new political
consensus. The years from 1945 to 1975 were the best in the history of
these isles, warts and all.
The physical marks and diseases of poverty, such as rickets and
tuberculosis, disappeared. Our children walked tall. Working-class
women, who in the past were old by 40, were now taking holidays abroad
in their sixties and seventies, and cavorting about like young things.
This was achieved through politics, meaning the complex relationships
of people in society, and the insistence that these relationships should
be part of the criteria guiding macroeconomic decision-making.
Then siren voices came from across the Atlantic. From Chicago a gang
of economists -- the monetarists -- emerged who wanted to drive
government and politics out of economics, who insisted the market should
determine everything as it did in the 1930s.
Keith Joseph heard these voices and relayed them to his disciples,
including a young woman from Grantham who became a zealot. The Blessed
Margaret was up and running, and became the boss of Britain. Economics
were disconnected from social values and social responsibility. Personal
greed was not only made acceptable but sanctified as the catalyst of
economic activity. It reminded me of that character in Joseph Heller's
Catch 22, Major Major's father, who tells his followers: ''The Good Lord
gave us two hands to grab everything we could for ourselves''.
Economics which eschew the human dimension create a society in which,
as Marx observed, the only nexus between man and man is callous cash
payment. The individual becomes a unit of consumption, a unit of labour,
a state statistic, and the seeds of alienation are sown. In pursuit of
this credo, NHS patients have been redesignated ''customers''. The only
thing missing is a cash register or credit card machine at the foot of
the customer's bed, but it's coming.
Such an economic ethos treats everyone and everything as a commodity,
with a price tag. No wonder there is sleaze in Parliament and elsewhere.
No wonder there seem to be more crooks in the City than in Barlinnie. No
wonder the commercial exploitation of sex is at an all-time high, or
low. If everything is a commodity, how could sex be an exception?
Mrs Thatcher said: ''There is no such thing as society.'' Which means
that instead of human beings living together, independent and
interdependent, one with another, we are simply a multiplicity of
self-seeking individuals; or as succinctly described by some punters:
''Bang the bell Jack, I'm on the bus''.
The market and market mechanisms are essential for economic
efficiency. The theories of value and exchange of Adam Smith and Karl
Marx, which were remarkably similar, presupposed the existence of a
market. But neither believed in the absolute dominance of market forces
to the exclusion of everything else -- and anyway both are dead, and
since their deaths the world has changed more than in the previous
10,000 years.
The absolute dominance of market forces has been tried and grotesquely
failed. It is economics without a soul and, therefore, amoral. It led to
the most horrendous world wars in human history. We cannot take our
youth into the new millennium lumbered by such outrageous and outmoded
baggage.
We need political economists. We need politicians who assert that it's
impossible in a civilised society to take economic decisions abstracted
from their social consequences. We need such an option available to us,
at the next election -- but it looks as if we won't get it.
The Tories are still ideologically imprisoned in Thatcherite market
and monetarist dogma. Labour is adapting itself to Thatcherite dogma in
the belief that it is a vote winner. If Labour wins it will hand to the
Bank of England the right to determine interest rates, an important
economic tool in the hands of government in pursuit of full employment
and other socially desirable objectives.
Banks take decisions on an evaluation of market forces and economic
indices -- that is their job. Governments are there to serve the public
interest. If political parties give up the powers and instruments by
which, in Government, they might serve the public interest, then they
are powerless to do good for the people, which is what politics are
supposed to be about.
If we go back to the economics of the past, we will have the problems
of the past, writ large. The past has value as memories which might
guide us to better ways.

The eternal search for youth entertains more quacks and weirdos every
day.
We hear of Younger Skin From Within, the new cassette tape from top
hypnotherapist Marisa Peer. The press release says, correctly, that her
style is quite unique. Over the past two years, apparently, Marisa has
been researching her new speciality -- Cell Command Therapy.
The tape is designed to put you in an ''Alpha'' state to allow your
mind to communicate directly with your cells. She claims results include
a firmer jawline, stronger nails and decreased lines. A quote from the
tape says: ''It has been proven that cells have an innate intelligence,
every cell in your body is a conscious being''.
If mind over matter works, then repeat after me: ''I will not give
money to spin doctors who promise to make me more attractive . . .''
Tapes cost #15 plus #1.99 p&amp;p. Call 0171-748 8276 to order.
* CARTIER the jeweller has produced a perfume for the Cartier woman,
whom he goes to great lengths to define. She is not a woman with which
any of us would connect, but the offshoot of his fevered and pretentious
imagination, and all to promote his new perfume called So Pretty.
The wee story which accompanies details of the perfume begins: ''She
thinks of everything because she is perfect, she often forgets because
she is human, but is always forgiven because she is so charming.
''In her timetable, but don't ever tell the kids, she sets aside days
for their naughtiness, on Thursdays and Tuesdays when from dawn to dusk
children are allowed to point their fingers, say bad words, put their
elbows on the table and devour delicate Exotic Dewberries by the
fistful.''
See yourself yet? ''Through small and magical feats she gives life its
essential values. At Customs she declares the Brazilian Diamond Orchids,
Florence Irises, Mysore Sandalwood and Tunisian Neroli . . . all
surprises for her best friends.''
I don't know about you lot, but this marketing ploy worked on me. I
was excited into rushing out to buy a bottle. Vodka, I think it was.
* THERE are some who believe that applying deodorant to the armpit is
unhealthy, that the act is a cruel one, where glands are effectively
plugged up by a glutinous substance, and that this can only be damaging
to the skin. Well, such numpties are now being catered for by the makers
of Driclor Solution, ''a major advance in the treatment of
perspiration''.
Driclor maintains that the purpose of ordinary deodorants is to reduce
or cover up body odour caused by perspiration interacting with bacteria.
They stop glands working by contraction, so that the sweat cannot flow.
But Driclor's solution doesn't sound that healthy either. It reduces the
amount of water which can escape, and this is then re-absorbed into the
body. Call the Driclor helpline if you have a sweat problem on 0800

<HEADLINE>Judge says price-fixing was 'endemic' in industry. Concrete firms fined #8.37m</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>19</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977043564</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
EIGHT ready-mixed concrete companies, including all the market
leaders, were yesterday fined a total of #8.375m for breaching
''blatant'' contempt of court orders banning them from taking part in
illegal price-fixing cartels.
The fines, imposed by the Restrictive Practices Court in London, were
the culmination of a major nationwide inquiry by the Director-General of
Fair Trading into price-fixing in the industry during the early 1980s.
Following the granting of court orders at the end of the 1970s, the
companies assured the Office of Fair Trading that the unlawful
agreements between regional company representatives had ceased.
But Mr Justice Buckley said yesterday that in fact they continued
almost without a break into the 1980s.
Representatives from the various suppliers would meet regularly to
pool local market information and allocate contracts between them by a
pre-arranged system of tendering.
''It is clear the object was to avoid free competition and to share
out and thus distort the market and fix prices,'' he said.
Such unlawful collusive arrangements had been ''endemic'' in the
market for years and constituted ''serious anti-competitive activity by
all the leading companies on a wide scale''.
The continuation of the agreements into the 1980s showed a ''blatant,
persistent and widespread disregard of court orders which strikes at the
heart of the rule of law and the public interest''.
It was an intolerable situation which demonstrated the ability of the
firms to control the market.
The companies and the fines imposed were:
* Tarmac Roadstone Holdings: #1.5m.
* Nine companies in the Ready Mixed Concrete group: total fines
#3.85m.
* Pioneer: #2.25m.
* Redland Readymix: #300,000.
* Tilcon Holdings: #300,000.
* Willment (which has now ceased trading): #50,000.
* Hartigan Readymix: #75,000.
* ARC: #50,000.
However, the companies' share prices did not suffer as a result of the
news. RMC Group added 5p to 1106p, with Tarmac up [1/2]p on 107p and
Redland advancing 5p to 403p.
The judge said the companies insisted that, following the court
orders, they expressly forbade their employees from involvement in
cartels.
But this was largely a paper exercise, he said, and in most cases
there was no proper monitoring system.
The court accepted that the agreements were not a result of boardroom
policy, but the individuals involved, some of them at managerial level,
knew they were acting unlawfully.
The judge warned that, in future, company employees involved in such
large-scale breaches of court orders should expect to go to prison for a
significant period.
* SENIOR Engineering announced yesterday it has reached an
out-of-court settlement following a long-running dispute with Slough
Estates.
Senior said the settlement would result in a #7m charge in the results
for the year to the end of December.
The dispute relates to a contract undertaken by its Thermal
Engineering business in an operation discontinued in 1992.
Senior, based in Rickmansworth, Herfordshire, was being sued by Slough
Estates because of reliability problems of a boiler at a power station
on a Slough trading estate.
But Senior said: ''The complexity of the project and the demands of
the legal process have created serious concerns that the litigation
could have ended in Senior being held liable for very substantial
consequential losses.
''After careful consideration the board has concluded that it is not
in the interests of shareholders to run this risk.''
In a trading update, Senior said its engineering products continued to
show good growth, helped by Berghofer and Metal Bellows, both bought in
April last year.
Thermal Engineering is showing a recovery from losses in the second
half of 1994 to profits near to those achieved in the first half of last
year.
The group said profits for the six months to the end of June, due to
be officially published on August 23 and excluding the #7m Slough
Estates provision, would be not less than #14m and further progress was
expected in the second half.

BT charges for international directory inquiries are to rise by 33%
from next month, the company announced yesterday.
The increase from 45p to 60p comes a year after BT halved UK directory
inquiries from 50p to 25p.
The increase will bring in an extra #1.65m a year to the company which
last week reported profits of #111-a-second.
BT last night claimed that it ran its directory inquiries service at a
loss and it was a subsidised service to the 11 million people a year who
used it.
The next charges are being introduced on September 5 as prices also
change for anyone using an operator to connect them to an overseas
number.
Instead of charging a premium rate per minute, BT is to charge the
same rate as a direct dial call but with a #1.80 initial charge.
BT said it makes almost all foreign calls via the operator cheaper
once the call goes past the two-minute stage.
A spokesman said: ''Around 500,000 people a year use the operator to
connect them while another 635 million phone direct dial.
''This will make it cheaper for them and is the same charge as inland
operator calls.
''Overseas directory inquiries cost a lot of money to run because we

MEMBERS of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament are preparing to flout
the authority of Inverness District Council tomorrow by floating 50
paper lanterns containing small candles down the River Ness to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the devastation of Hiroshima by the
first atomic bomb.
The campaign's Highland branch is hoping the ceremony will also draw
attention to the French government's decision to resume nuclear testing
in the South Pacific.
The council's general purposes committee originally approved the event
but earlier this week the full council decided it was opposed on grounds
of safety, namely that the candles could blow up Inverness Harbour.
In fact, CND almost did just that in 1988. It had been commemorating
the dropping of the first atomic bomb for the previous seven years by
sailing burning candles down the River Ness in a flotilla of paper
boats. That year, however, the candles came close to the oil tanker
Shell Trader which was discharging 2500 tonnes of fuel at Inverness
Harbour.
The harbour trust took a very dim view of the episode, given that men
on the tanker had not even been allowed to carry lighters in their
pockets. This year, however, there does not seem to be any question of a
tanker being in port.
CND spokeswoman Ms Jeanette Wyatt said: ''We have informed the port
authority of our plans but they have said that they can't tell us what
is happening on Sunday. I mean, this is Friday. I think all the
arguments about safety are just a smokescreen, if you pardon the pun,
for old prejudices. We are putting the candles in up the river at Eden
Court and, as anybody that knows the Ness will tell you, they will be
lucky to get half-way down.''
Councillor Ron Lyon said yesterday: ''I was actually the one who moved
support for the event at the general purposes committee. Everyone
sympathises with the spirit of what CND are trying to do.
''But I do understand why the council reversed that decision. When you
get reports from the harbour master and the fire chief expressing
concern, and the insurers are talking about an indemnity of #25m, you
start to think this will be the one night that someone will leave a tap
from a fuel tank open while the candles are sailing down towards it.''
A fire-brigade spokesman said: ''There is potential for a major
disaster here but we have no legislative powers to prevent it.''
The district council plans to ask the police to take action to prevent
the ceremony because the authority has banned it. However, a police
spokesman said: ''I don't see what law they will be breaking if they go
ahead with it. I don't think a breach of the peace would cover it.''
Ms Wyatt said: ''We have carried out tests and are confident there is
no potential for anything going wrong. Despite all the fears being
expressed, we will carry on.''

A SHERIFF yesterday called for stricter laws governing self-employed
car repairers after hearing how a man became engulfed in flames and died
from terrible injuries.
Mr Alexander Hill was drenched in petrol from a car he was repairing
in a rented outhouse when fumes reached a fire in an oil drum.
A fatal accident inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court heard yesterday
that, because 45-year-old Mr Hill worked on his own, there was no need
for him to register with the Health and Safety Department.
Sheriff John McGowan said: ''There are about 20 petrol fires a year
resulting in serious injury or death in small workshops that the safety
officers don't even know exist.
''A strict system of licensing is required so that such workshops
cannot operate without inspection.''
The accident happened at Woodhead Farm, near Stepps, on March 8 this
year, when Mr Hill was removing a petrol tank from a car.
Petrol soaked his clothing and the fumes drifted to his home-made oil
drum fire and swept back over him.
His girlfriend, 28-year-old Jane Rennie, of Tarbert Farm, Ghia, said
she was working on the other side of the car and tried to help.
However, Mr Hill collapsed and when she tried to get back into the
outhouse with a coat over her head she was beaten back by the flames.
In a written judgment, Sheriff McGowan returned a formal verdict that
Mr Hill, who was staying in a rented cottage on the former farm, died
from the inhalation of fire fumes.
The deceased's estranged wife, 41-year-old Mrs Joyce Hill, had written
to her husband on the night of his death, asking him to become friends
with her again.
After the inquiry, Mrs Hill, of Queen's Crescent, Bodam, near
Peterhead, said: ''I'm so sorry he never got my letter. Although we
would not have got back together, we could have been friends and our two
grown-up sons would have liked that, too.''
Mrs Hill said she got her letter back and it was now buried with her
husband.

SCOTTISH Opera has been issued with a timetable of industrial action
by its chorus that includes both of the company's scheduled appearances
at the Edinburgh Festival.
With a programme of disruption timed to begin next Wednesday, the day
after the parties meet the conciliation service, Acas, Scottish Opera
yesterday admitted it was in a state of ''general anxiety''.
The 34-member chorus voted in favour of strike action earlier this
week following the management's imposition of a pay freeze on the entire
company. The chorus's union, Equity, has subsequently notified Scottish
Opera of a five-point programme of industrial action.
The primary target for disruption is Dvorak's opera, The Jacobin,
which is scheduled for two performances at the Edinburgh Festival
Theatre on August 14 and 16. A rehearsal of Mozart's Don Giovanni,
scheduled for the Glasgow season in the autumn, will also be hit.
The first action will take place next Wednesday during what is called
the pre-general rehearsal in Glasgow.
Following that, the chorus will take action on Saturday 12 at the
actual dress rehearsal, the first appearance of the company onstage at
the Edinburgh Festival Theatre. The two performances of the opera itself
have also been nominated for disruption.
The company's anxiety is not just over the programme of action itself
but also uncertainty over the nature of the action. Under law, the
Scottish Opera chorus does not have to intimate to the company the type
of action it will take, only the timing.
''They haven't told us and don't need to tell us,'' said Ms Roberta
Doyle, head of marketing and press at Scottish Opera, yesterday. Action,
said Ms Doyle, could range from turning up for performances without
make-up or costume, to not turning up at all, or turning up and walking
out.
There are no further meetings scheduled until next Tuesday at Acas.
''Tuesday, therefore, is crunch day,'' said Ms Doyle. Both sides of
the dispute are hoping that Tuesday will bring some sort of
resolution.''
Advance sales for performances of The Jacobin are running at about
60%, though a late surge is expected if the conflict is resolved.

<TEXT>
THE Parachute Regiment is to quit Northern Ireland, it was announced
yesterday.
The regiment's 2nd battalion has completed a two-year tour of duty in
the province and is to return to its base in Aldershot.
It is understood there are no current plans for any of the three Para
battalions to return to the province in the near future.
However, Army sources insisted that the battalion will be replaced by
another 550-strong non-parachute battalion and that the Paras could
return, if necessary.
''The Parachute Regiment has completed its two-year tour of duty and
it is time for them to leave,'' said an Army spokesman.''There is
nothing sinister in this.''
Sinn Fein welcomed the withdrawal of ''this notorious regiment'' but
said the number of troops in the province would not actually fall. Nor
would it bring Belfast any closer to a permanent peace.
Nationalists have loathed the Parachute Regiment since 1972, when its
soldiers were involved in the shooting of 13 civilians in Londonderry on
Bloody Sunday.
More recently, paratrooper Lee Clegg caused outrage when released from
jail early after killing a teenage joyrider at a Belfast checkpoint.
An Army spokesman in Northern Ireland said it would be the first time
in the last 25 years there had been no Parachute Regiment battalions in
the province.
SDLP security spokesman and deputy leader Seamus Mallon said the
regiment had ''brought nothing but misery to the people of Northern
Ireland''.
''They will be remembered not for any role in solving our problems but
the various ways in which they have exacerbated and added to a volatile
situation, especially their involvement in Bloody Sunday and numerous
incidents, including the Clegg case.''
The acting commander of the 2nd Battalion, Major Geoff Weighell, told
guests at a reception in Palace Barracks, Holywood, County Down: ''We
have at all times tried to maintain good relations with the local
community, which has not always been easy.
''I hope by now that you realise the Parachute Regiment is not just
about generating violence in defence of the realm. We are capable of
aggression in battle but are very self-disciplined as a regiment.''

<TEXT>
A YOUNG car thief, who has repeatedly absconded from care homes, has
been sent to a secure residential unit for another year at a likely cost
to the taxpayer of more than #62,000.
The boy -- known as the Scarlet Pimpernel because of the number of
times he has given social workers the slip -- will not be 16 until later
this month and cannot be named for legal reasons.
Yesterday, a sheriff at Stirling was given details of his record and
written advice from the Children's Panel in Glasgow when the boy
appeared for sentence.
He has been described as a middle-class child from a broken home with
a ''considerable history'' of car theft. He was 13 when he committed his
first crimes -- an assault and robbery, and fire-raising, both in April
1993.
In May 1994, at 14, he stole his first car, going on to be reported
another nine times, mainly for car theft and associated traffic
offences.
Sentence had been deferred at Stirling Sheriff Court for the advice of
the panel after he admitted stealing a car from Stirling Golf Club.
He also admitted attempting to force open a petrol pump at the Fintry
Garage, Fintry, Stirlingshire, with intent to steal, on October 3,
driving a car illegally on the Torrance to Lennoxtown road, and failing
to stop. The offences were committed after he escaped while on an outing
from a secure unit in Glasgow.
Yesterday, he appeared in the dock flanked by two male care workers.
He had twice missed earlier hearings at Stirling after going on the run.
His non-appearance on the second occasion resulted in Sheriff Robert
Younger issuing a warrant for his arrest.
The boy's solicitor, Miss Laura Reilly, said his latest spate of
offending followed a decision at the begining of the year to transfer
the boy from the secure unit in Glasgow, where he had spent 11 months,
to a more open regime at a residential school in Ayrshire.
She said it had been felt a move to a more relaxed regime would be
''appropriate''. It is understood, however, that it resulted in him
going on the run 10 times in two months.
Miss Reilly said during his escapes the boy had become involved in ''a
number of matters'' in Kilmarnock and Stirling.
He had spent a week in custody at the Scottish Prison Service's
Longriggend remand centre near Airdrie before Sheriff David Smith at
Kilmarnock ordered he be kept in a residential unit for 12 months and
banned him from driving for three years.
Miss Reilly said social workers had found him a place in a secure unit
at another residential school in Ayrshire but it was too soon to make an
assessment of his progress there.
She said the boy knew that time was running out for him because he is
16 on August 26. ''He realises this is the last chance for him to be
dealt with by the juvenile system,'' she added.
Formally referring the case back to the Children's Panel in Glasgow,
Sheriff Younger told the boy: ''You'll be in this unit for some time.''
Strathclyde Regional Council has already spent nearly #80,000 trying
to keep the boy in care. That bill now looks set to almost double.

ENVIRONMENTAL health officers have finally traced the source of a foul
stench affecting Dundonians and people living in north-east Fife to a
remote pig farm.
Unfortunately, the farmer, who spread pig slurry over two fields but
failed to plough it in, has gone on holiday and cannot be traced.
North-east Fife depute environmental health director John Stark said:
''After a long process of elimination, we believe we can isolate the
problem to two fields in the St Michaels area.
''It took a lot of detective work to find these fields. They are in
the middle of nowhere.''
Hot weather and a south-easterly wind have been blamed for carrying
the smell over the Tay to Dundee.
Mr Stark said: ''The farmer is away. We urgently need him to plough
the slurry into the fields. It's very unusual for farmers to be
spreading slurry at this time of year.''

ON this evidence, The Eden Court Outreach team's first venture into
community drama is an auspicious and promising debut; there is clearly a
pool of talented performers and also the necessary insight as to how
best to harness those skills.
In delving into the enigmatic history of John Merrick The Elephant
Man, director Kieran Gillespie has devised the show which echoes David
Lynch's filmic treatment in that it draws parallels between the brutal
exploitation of Merrick at the hands of a circus showman and the jeering
mob and the cynical exploitation of him by an ambitious medical
consultant and the patronising Victorian high society.
Initially, the exposition is faltering, with too many choppy scene
changes, and the influence of the film is perhaps too pronounced -- some
of its references are slavishly pronounced, eg, the scene between
Merrick and the actress Mrs Kendal, when they enact an excerpt from
Romeo and Juliet. But the show is not without a pleasing originality,
most noticeably in a mesmerising storm sequence, choreographed by
Scottish Ballet's Dancer in Residence Sandie Wilson, with people
whirling across the stage with poetic precision, evoking the circus
people being blown out of town.
Joel Strachan also brings a unique touch, evoking Merrick's
deformities via sustained grimace and awkward contortions than layers of
laytex and via an eloquently conveyed understanding of Merrick's psyche.
Strachan is the only professional actor but his performance is
admirably matched by the rest of the 30-strong cast. The Victorian
characterisations can verge on the picaresque but in allowing his cast
to test themselves on multiple roles, Gillespie creates a sense of a
company having fun, an atmosphere which is effectively conveyed to the
audience.

BASED on a true story, this production by Aberdeen's City Youth
Theatre exposes the hostilities between the east coast Scots and the
incoming Gaels in Wick during the herring boom of the 1850s. It had a
bizarre spark -- an argument over the theft of an orange from a young
Gaelic boy exploding the tensions and soon escalating into violent
riots. Henry Adam's script focuses on the doomed romance of two
teenagers, Roddy and Catriona, from the opposing communities -- a sort
of Across the Barricades of the nineteenth century, a fishy Romeo and
Juliet.
Monika Nisbet has created a stunning, sturdy set composed of coiled
ropes, nets, barrels, and ladders, its authenticity complemented by
eerie lighting from Grant Wilson, sunrise seeping through a massive
canvas backdrop evoking a shoreline. Director Tina West conducts
proceedings with sweeping flourishes, frozen tableaux a striking, if a
somewhat overused, effect.
Although visually compelling, the story is more troublesome, the plot
predicated by laboured twists and some puzzlingly inconsistent
relationships between the main characters. Not to mention some
bewilderingly modern parlance. At times the action almost sinks beneath
these problems.
However, energetic performances -- and particularly from Thomas
Forbes, playing Roddy's brother with vicious passion -- and some
exhilarating highly stylised fight sequences are enthralling enough to
keep this ambitious project afloat.

APLAY by Tom Pow, Wilderness of Dreams (Radio 4), managed to make the
central character a metaphor for writing itself. The potentially bogus
notion of a person relieving himself of every familial or romantic
association in order to explore the edge of survival in the wilds was
stripped of any hippy-dippiness by the dramatic accuracy of the people
left behind in the literal wake of the eccentric's dream.
Laurance Rudic played the brother of the existential voyager with a
bitter containment that perfectly conveyed the conventional sibling's
annoyance in the face of a destiny pre-empted by another.
As part of a flow of beautifully interlocked monologues, his evocation
of a family in which his urban life is deemed less important than the
rare postcard from James on his travels.
The play was not about a loner with wanderlust, but rather like the
best jazz it sought to play all the variants of a man whose life was so
uneasy that the wilderness seemed like a vocation which could not be
denied.
The Canadian context allowed Pow, with impressive lyrical power, to
take on the internal landscape which is our experience of family and
marry it to our relationship with nature. Martin Amis writes about the
danger of ''going out too far'' and the character of James finally --
dying of malnutrition just at the point where returning makes sense --
comes to realise that he is not surrounded by likeminded furry
existentialist fellow-travellers but beings who stare at him with the
correct questions: the coyote in his imagination asks him: ''What made
you think that you could be part of any of this?''
The lonely spirit ultimately cannot share a consciousness with the
moose and the coyote because they live in a place which, to them, is not
wilderness.
The play starts with a Mountie flatly listing the effects left by the
deceased and the mother, on the evidence of this inventory, realises
that the sleeping bag she had hand-sewn was her son's shroud.
She remembers bathing him as a baby, her knuckles brushing the shallow
bath and the clarity of his gaze. Her husband, her son's father, is an
architect, a profession which his city-hating son considers a kind of
spatial imperialism.
At every point, listening to this, you felt yourself on the edge of
shouting: ''Oh, for goodness sake stop quoting Rimbaud to yourself and
phone your mother!''
Then the subtle reminder would permeate the language and keep you
listening: for what was being explored was the human recognition, was
the wilderness inside and the constant need for sanctuary.
The mother mourned audibly while her son was alive, the father only
wept after the knowledge of his death.
The brother loathed the selfishness that had broken them all apart and
you empathised with them all.
As an urbanite, who thinks of camping as the holiday equivalent of
joining a Wee Free sect, I consider it a triumph of this play that it
brought me back to a time when I was not scared to go beyond the city.
Considering nature to be an abattoir only relieved by the distraction of
language and good restaurants, loves and children, the Wilderness of
Dreams was, for me, a journey explored with integrity and notated with
unforced poetry.
And while I would not wear a back pack to chum him, the central
character won me over when it was revealed that his greatest fear was
community singing.
The odd community we share with that rich country that speaks English
too is being cleverly explored in Divided by a Common Language (Radio 4)
in which Bill Bryson works out how the shared accent of seventeenth
century England forked out in such different directions after the
Plymouth colonialists became Americans.
This was fascinating listening and contained a nice reminder to Prince
Charles, who has been known to patronise American usage, that he
couldn't park, stub his toe or be in two minds without it.

AN 86-year-old man lay undiscovered in the lavatory of a doctors'
surgery in Fife for 30 hours as police searched for him, it was revealed
yesterday.
Mr John Ross, suspected to have suffered a stroke, was found
unconscious in the Muiredge surgery in Buckhaven, and was in a poor but
stable condition in hospital at Kirkcaldy last night.
His family and their MP have spoken of their anger, and the surgery
admitted that a blunder had been made, but refused to say if anyone was
being disciplined as a result of the incident.
The surgery admitted in a statement: ''Procedures for checking and
securing the practice were not followed, and the reasons for this will
be thoroughly investigated.
''We are all shocked and very sorry that this has occurred at Muiredge
Surgery, where we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of
care for our patients.
''This has been a very regrettable incident for which all the staff
send our sincere apologies to the family concerned.''
Police, who called at the surgery several times during their
inquiries, were told the old man, from Sea Road, Methil, had left his
home to collect a prescription for his wife.
Eventually, his own son went to collect it, unaware that his father
was in a state of collapse on the premises.
Mr Ross's presence was not only missed by practice staff when they
locked up on Tuesday evening, but also on Wednesday morning by the two
women cleaners employed by a local firm which holds the contract to
clean the premises each morning.
His family said yesterday that they would be demanding answers and
were seeking legal advice because they were ''appalled'' by what had
happened.
His son Jack said: ''It is horrible to think that he lay there for so
long.''
MP Henry McLeish added: ''It seems inconceivable that this sort of
thing can happen in 1995. Surely to goodness we know that a lot of
vulnerable elderly and often very sick people come to surgeries, and it
is clear that mishaps can overtake them.
''I would have thought it would have been a basic course of action for
all parts of a surgery to be checked, particularly toilets, to see if
anyone had been in difficulty.''
He welcomed an investigation promised by Fife Health Board.
The board's director of primary care, Dr Gavin McBurnie, stated: ''We
are absolutely appalled that something like this has happened. We will
take what steps we can to ensure this cannot happen again.''
Police said they used a staff of 20 officers and three tracker dogs to
search for Mr Ross and were satisfied that they had done everything
possible to find him.

I WAS concerned by Mr Farmer's letter about grant funding for Junior
football clubs (August 1). I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Farmer,
Scotland is short of good quality pitches and other facilities. This was
identified as a key issue in Sport 2000, the Scottish Sports Council's
development plan for taking sport into the twenty-first century.
Since Sport 2000 much has been done to attempt to rectify this
problem. The Scottish Sports Council pioneers new developments in
facility planning, design and management. The council also works with
local authorities, governing bodies, and clubs to develop plans at a
local level.
In addition, funds are available from the Football Trust and more
recently the Lottery Sports Fund. Both funds are administered by the
Scottish Sports Council, although they operate independently.
Eligibility conditions reflect the different objectives of the funds,
and each programme is supported by a set of clear guidelines. These
guidelines are in place to ensure that funds are directed to targeted,
viable projects.
We have consulted widely with clubs, governing bodies, and local
authorities to develop application forms for both programmes which are
designed to be user-friendly, whilst drawing out the detailed
information needed to evaluate applications.
Trained staff are able to help potential applicants with any
difficulties. These measures ensure that a small club is placed on the
same basis as its more affluent neighbour who can draw on a wealth of
expertise to complete an application for funding.
In both instances the application process takes months rather than
years. The Scottish Sports Council is as keen as anyone to see funds
allocated as quickly as possible.
There are opportunities for clubs to make substantial bids to upgrade
and develop facilities through the Lottery Sports Fund and Football
Trust. One of the Football Trust programmes has allocated #300,000 per
annum for the last two years, for facility development at Junior and
non-League senior clubs.
The Lottery Sports Fund has received over #13m this year, and
allocated almost #6m to 62 different projects across the country. This
week, in the last round of awards, two football clubs, Milton Rovers
Youth FC and Cupar Hearts Amateur FC, both received awards totalling
#63,000.
Both of these awards are accessible and open to all. I hope all clubs
will make the most of these opportunities.

AN eight-year-old Scots girl was critically ill last night after an
accident at the end of a four-day holiday in Blackpool.
Natalie Brown was still in intensive care, 24 hours after a car
collided with her father's Mini Metro.
The family decided it would be cooler to drive home from Blackpool
during the night but soon after the Browns, from Letterfearn Drive,
Summerston, Glasgow, reached the M55 motorway, the lights on their car
failed.
They were forced to pull over on to the motorway hard shoulder and,
just after midnight, another car travelling on the eastbound carriageway
hit the back of the parked vehicle.
Last night, Natalie was said by staff at the Royal Preston Hospital,
Lancashire, to be critical but stable.
Her parents, Jacqueline, 30, and Charles, 38, who was driving the car,
were also taken to hospital where they were said to be comfortable.
* A 12-year-old girl suffered serious head injuries last night after
being knocked down by a car in Westerhouse Road at Cairnbrook Road,
Easterhouse, Glasgow. Nicola Tomlinson, of Errogie Street, Easterhouse,
was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary but later transferred to the
Southern General Hospital, Glasgow.

SINCE the publication of my two letters on aspects of Zulu culture, I
have repeatedly been asked why an ex-footballer (or Old Crock, to use
their rather impertinent sobriquet) should be so interested in this
subject.
The answer is that the history of battles, epic feats, heroes, and
cowards often has a parallel in football. Generals are merely managers
on a grand scale, captains convey their orders at the front, the
infantry do all the work, the occasional star receives special
attention, while the Top Brass, directors in football terms, sit in
special areas some distance from the action, wining and dining.
In the early part of the nineteenth century, the Zulus were quite
special warriors, the Brazilians of their day, to continue the soccer
analogy. Their King and General, Shaka, was one of Africa's most
fascinating men with talents and ideas way ahead of his time.
Not that he lacked opposition to some of his theories. When he
realised the stupidity of throwing the assegai at an opponent, thus
leaving the thrower defenceless, he developed the stabbing spear
mentioned by Mr Stephen (August 2).
Many of his older soldiers were doubtful, though, of the new method
and it took some persuasion on Shaka's part to bring them round. Many a
manager has similar problems with football tactics.
Shortly afterwrds Shaka adopted another method to put his message
across, one unfortunately not available to Messrs Smith, Burns, Aitken,
Kirkwood, et al. He ordered that all his regiments discard their
sandals, believing that bare feet meant quicker movement and less
trouble.
There was much muttering about this order, so Shaka decided to impose
his authority. Three-pronged Devil Thorns, each spike one-sixteenth of
an inch long, were scattered over the parade ground, their shape meaning
that one prong always pointed upwards.
Shaka then made all his men remove their sandals and insisted that
they stamped the thorns into the ground. Just to help the movement
along, he announced that anyone deemed not to be banging away with
enough enthusiasm would be executed immediately. Apparently, after a
dozen or so were led away, the frenzy of stamping which ensued was
something to behold.
Ruthless, perhaps, but certainly one extreme way of forcing one's
charges to accept authority. And to think that Jock Wallace used to be
criticised for taking his team over to Gullane for a run up the dunes.

YOU might be forgiven for thinking that, with the laddish and larky
football jape A Game Of Two Halves already on the schedule, Scottish
Television might be guilty of a certain duplication in running a new
series called Scottish Men. What's A Game Of Two Halves, after all, but
five more or less ageing lads cracking daft jokes and talking about
football, joshing and male-bonding away like crazy without fear of being
interrupted by girlies? And what could be more like Scottish men than
that?
Yet this Tuesday-night gathering of that great Scots clan MacHismo was
much more fun than it might have been, mostly on account of presenter
Kaye Adams's wry, affectionate scepticism, and some piquant selection of
subjects. Although claiming a mission to ''get to the bottom of the
Scots male psyche'' -- well, you wouldn't exactly need a diving bell for
that, would you? -- the Adams-angle was neither hectoring nor glum,
preferring simply to get hold of a few typical species of Laddus
Caledoniensis and let them drop their metaphorical trousers in front of
the camera.
So we had George Macaulay, the ''Scottish representative of the UK
Men's Movement'' -- proud of the title, as the Living Skeleton said when
they showed him -- telling Kaye how men's natural cave instincts had
been repressed by decades of feminism. Men naturally communicate on an
animal level, he said. When two guys meet, their natural reaction is to
think about duffing each other up. And when a man meets a woman . . .
well, brace y'self, Sheila, as they say in the Outback.
Next time George meets a woman, though, I reckon he should try to get
her to stick around long enough to flick a duster around the place. His
pad looked like Calamity Jane's cabin before Doris Day got houseproud.
Also representing the less fragrant side of Scottish masculinity was
Scot FM's radio shock-jock ''Scottie McClue'', whose late-night phone-in
show is the creepiest and most embarrassing thing in broadcasting since
the days of Richard Park's Doctor Dick's Midnight Surgery on Clyde --
the one in which a night-shift baker was once asked whether he liked to
give Mrs Bun ''a wee roll in the morning''.
Kaye Adams claimed to detect a sad whiff of ''Brut aftershave and old
socks'' off Scottie's male callers, and she let him get away with a
spiel about him being a cross between ''father figure and wind-up
merchant''. But what Scottie's show really smells of is cheap booze,
poverty, and too many cigarettes; and what it sounds like is a clever
guy taking the mickey out of poor, underprivileged people who don't have
the sophistication to see his lousy little joke. Scottie is much more
interesting as a case study than his callers are: a perfect example of
that unlovely national figure, the Scotsman on the make.
More typical, I like to hope, were Edinburgh biker gang The Saddle
Tramps, a fearsome team of motorpsycho nightmares who like to ride away
for the weekend, camp out around the campfire, and talk about bikes,
beer, and going home to Artex the ceiling. Born to be mild, which most
of us (Scots possessors of a Y chromosome, that is) are, given the right
company. As Kaye Adams summed up: ''Looking and acting the part is such
a big thing for guys; it's not a matter of standing out from the crowd,
but standing up in it''. Moral: pick your crowd with care.
The Tales Of Para Handy (BBC1) sailed on gamely enough, considering
that every mariner in the crew of the SS Vital Spark is wearing around
his neck an albatross marked How Come There's Only Three Shows In This
Series, Then? It's not the quality of playing or a failure to hit the
right note of gentle, pawky Highland humour that has holed the old
puffer amidships; the transposition to the 1930s fits comfortably and
the characterisations, particularly those of Gregor Fisher and Rikki
Fulton as Para Handy and Macphail, tread lightly on our memories of
their predecessors.
Instead, the problem lies in Neil Munro's characters being forced into
adventures too farcical and unlikely to sit well with their douce and
couthy personalities. It's perfectly natural for Para and Dougie to
consult a fairground fortune teller, as they did in this opening episode
(Barbara Rafferty was very droll, in a performance that owed a lot to
Lottery soothsayer Mystic Meg), but not for them then to buy a
second-hand diving suit and send Sunny Jim to look for treasure in the
Sound of Jura; or for the treasure -- tins of bully beef -- to blow up
and destroy the owner's new office on Tarbert pier. The Tales Of Para
Handy suffers from a common Scottish masculine failing: striving just a
bit too hard.
Meanwhile down in Brighton, something nasty laps against the timbers
as Resort To Murder (BBC1), a highly-stylised and defiantly unrealistic
five-part murder mystery, continues on its melodramatic way. Set against
a background of dusty penny arcades, kiss-me-quick seaside romance, and
plenty of the mean entrepreneurial villainy natural to a town with both
a racecourse and a pleasure beach, Tony McHale's sinister thriller stars
Ben Chaplin as a young man whose almost insolvent amusement
arcade-owning father, David Daker, was unfortunate enough to be alone
with his highly-insured wife when a stranger ran up to her and pushed
her over the pier.
If Ben can't find a ''mystery witness'' before the bad guys do, Pa
looks like going down for a spell.
If you were thinking of asking some sort of cute question like what's
it all about, then?, I suggest you either wait for a couple more
episodes, or ask the scriptwriter, because I'm not terribly well clued
up on that aspect myself. It operates as a psychological thriller rather
than a classic criminal crossword puzzle, and for the moment you don't
need to know very much about motives or details, any more than any
reader of Graham Greene's Brighton Rock needs to know exactly why
Pinkie's racecourse gang killed Fred Hale.
What matters is that the tawdry, down-at-heel atmosphere of a fading
seaside town is caught bang to rights; that the baddies have been
furnished with a suitably sinister range of eccentricities (snakes,
tattooing, etc); and that it gives full weight -- and this is unusually
sophisticated in any kind of crime fiction -- to the nauseating,
terrifying impact of serious violence on ordinary, decent people who
aren't used to dealing with extraordinarily nasty people.
If it's a plot you're looking for, try the cemetery; that's where most
of the characters are headed anyway.

The guided-missile destroyer HMS Glasgow, which is on a UN mission to
prevent arms from reaching the former Yugoslavia, was yesterday involved
in a rescue operation which has probably saved the lives of four
suspected gun runners.
Operating in the Straits of Otranto, HMS Glasgow spotted an unmanned
20ft speedboat in trouble four miles off the Albanian coast.
In a four-hour Nato rescue operation, four survivors were plucked from
a rocky outcrop near Albania. One body was recovered from the sea.
While Nato warships are stopping and searching merchant ships for
arms, they can do nothing about the 50 speedboats which make daily trips
between Italy and the coastline of former Yugoslavia.
The so-called ''cigarette boats'' are known to be involved in
smuggling and may be backed by the Mafia.

CAN anyone explain what an Orange flute player is, because, as far as
I am aware, and anyone who is knowledgeable about the history of flute
bands knows, flute bands are traditional to both factions of the
religious divide?
Secondly, why has there been no furore when players from both Rangers
and opposition teams have mimicked flute players in response to the
crowd at Ibrox?
As for Labour MP George Foulkes advising anyone as how to behave in
public, that is a bit rich considering his recent public behaviour.
Perhaps he would be better taking an interest in his beloved Heart of
Midlothian and advising them how to behave in the public eye.

SIXTY years ago after Rangers' Sports I was in a small company at
Ibrox, having tea, and presided over by Mr Bill Struth, and Bailie
Buchanan, who I think was chairman of Rangers Football Club.
One of the party suggested to Mr Struth that he should have a look at
a certain good football player.
Struth's retort was: ''I know he is a good football player but would
be be a good Ranger?''

JOHN LINKLATER'S tongue-in-cheek view (August 1) of the thrills
supplied by ''watching'' sport on Teletext brought back to mind memories
of that very subject.
Greenock Morton were playing against unfancied Cowdenbeath in a League
Cup Tie some years back and the game went into extra time and finally
penalty kicks.
After what felt like the longest shoot-out in the history of the game,
up flashed the score: 9-8 to Cowdenbeath. Disbelief! I switched over to
Ceefax where, to my relief, the score became 9-8 in Morton's favour.
Which was right? Arbitration, a third umpire, was called for. I
telephoned your very own Sportsdesk in Albion Street.
After I related my tale, the reporter went to check and returned to
the phone. ''Where do you come from?'' he inquired. ''Greenock,'' was my
reply.
His voice tailed off in quite genuine sympathy: ''I am very sorry, I
have some bad news for you . . . ''

JOHN Macleod and Scottish Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton make
strange bedfellows. About the only thing they appear to have in common
is a decided lack of knowledge of naval architecture.
It is now almost universally accepted that if you flood the car deck
on the type of ferry they are enthusing over the vessel will capsize in
minutes -- unless there are bulkheads to reduce the free surface effect.
The Royal Institution of Naval Architects has so advised the all-party
House of Commons' Transport Committee. And, remember, it would be some
of the RINA members who were responsible for this design in the first
place.
When the parliamentary committee's report was leaked to the press the
Shipping Minister, Viscount Goschen, blithely told the nation during a
TV interview that there had only been two ferry casualties. Fortunately
his civil servants rebriefed him before his next appearance.
This highlights the danger of those with little knowledge appearing to
''know-it-all''.
Have a look at the profile of the new vessel, Isle of Lewis. Spot the
one lifeboat on each side? About the height of the top of the funnel.
Almost as if it had been stuck on at the end as an afterthought. The
designers will explain that this is to avoid the lifeboat getting
damaged when the ship is berthing.
Any competent shipmaster will tell you that this could be achieved
four decks lower by the simple expediency of a recess in the hull. The
lifeboat would then be ready for duty in an emergency at the optimum
position.
The continuing reduction in lifeboat capacity, usually in line with an
increase in passenger numbers, indicates reliance on a marine escape
system for passenger evacuation. This is a system of chutes and
inflatable liferafts -- regrettably never properly researched or tested
in the context of marine safety.
The question of course becomes academic if the car deck floods. The
system would be about as useful as the lifejacket under your seat on the
Glasgow/London air shuttle.
An interesting legal question arises from all this prevarication by
people who should know better. The Secretary of State for Transport and
his Ministers, senior officials of the Marine Safety Agency, Chamber of
Shipping personnel, and the International Maritime Organisation are now
all aware that the bow doors of most ferries are leaking.
If we have another ferry disaster will these people be accessories in
a case of corporate manslaughter?
My bet is the poor old shipmaster will be the fall guy for daring to
take his ship to sea when he knew the law required these bow doors to be
watertight.

MEMBERS of the close-knit former mining community of Bonnyrigg came
together yesterday to remember an event that is etched indelibly on
their lives.
They were paying tribute to Mr David Dunn, 63, who was shot dead when
he tried to stop three men after a #185,000 bank raid last October.
He was honoured at an official ceremony in his home town when Lothian
and Borders Police awarded citations. One was accepted on Mr Dunn's
behalf by his widow, Jessie, and son, David.
Other townsfolk and police officers, who were involved in perhaps the
most traumatic day in Bonnyrigg's history, also received awards.
In an unprecedented action, the police force honoured the whole
community by giving it a citation, because, according to Chief
Superintendent Kenneth Thomson, the reaction of those involved typified
the community.
He said: ''If it is possible for anything positive to come out of such
a shocking incident, it is that the events drew the people of this
close-knit community even closer together in a united and concerted
response to overcome horrendous intrusion into their daily lives, and
their unstinting support to the police and to each other in the face of
such tragedy.''
Earlier, Lothian and Borders Chief Constable Sir William Sutherland
referred to the incident in which Mr Dunn, a former mining engineer,
tackled the driver of the getaway car in a car park behind a bank but
was shot by an accomplice from the back seat. Sir William described Mr
Dunn as ''a decent, honest family man''.
The three robbers -- Robert Smith, Paul Bootland, and Gerald McQuade
-- were sentenced to lengthy prison terms having been convicted on a
series of charges, including the murder of Mr Dunn.
Later, Mrs Dunn praised her friends and neighbours for the part they
played in bringing the men to justice.
''Bonnyrigg is that sort of town. We are close and people do tend to
look after each other,'' she said.
The award to the town was accepted by community councillor Mrs Eleanor
Neil. She said: ''The events of that day are still talked about. I have
young children and every time I pass the place where this happened it
triggers memories.
''I think the community will never come to terms with it but it gives
me a great sense of pride that the people of our town who were able to
help the police have been thanked officially.''
Community council chairman Derek Milligan, a former miner at Bilston
Glen Colliery, knew and worked with Mr Dunn. He said: ''I too am proud.
But this place is full of hardy, brave people. What happened that day
was awful and it is such a tragedy that someone had to lose a life.''

THE parents of a 13-year-old boy, who was found murdered on a Northern
Ireland golf course, yesterday appealed to the public to help find the
killer before he strikes again.
They said: ''Whoever did this to our son is capable of doing it to
anyone's son.''
They appealed to the murderer: ''Turn yourself in before you put any
other family through what we are going through today.''
Experts say Darren Fawns, from Repulse Court, Antrim, died from head
injuries about three days before a Belgian tourist found his
partly-clothed body on the 11th tee of the Massereene Links near Lough
Neagh on Thursday.
The sports-mad schoolboy had been missing for six days and local
police had been searching for him, but had chosen not to alert the
media.
Detectives have refused to say if the killing was a sex-related crime
and said several details were being withheld for ''investigative
reasons''.
Darren's Scottish-born father, Alan, and his wife, Pat, told
journalists the murderer must be caught, if only to spare others the
suffering they were enduring.
The couple said they had heard about the deaths of two boys in England
and a girl in Wales, adding: ''But it's so true when they say you never
think this will happen to you.''
Mr Fawns said: ''No other parent should go through this, definitely
not. So anybody who knows anything please get in touch with the
police.''
There was a response just a few hours later when a member of the
public handed to police a pair of black and green training shoes similar
to those missing from Darren's body.
In a Radio Ulster interview, Mr Fawns said he and his family were
finding the death very hard to accept, ''especially the way he died''.
''If it had been an accident, I don't think I would have felt so bad.
But for him to be murdered like that, I can't understand it,'' he said.
Darren, a second-year pupil at Parkhall High School, was reported
missing by his parents at 3am last Saturday.
At a news conference in Antrim police station, a senior RUC officer
defended the decision not to put out a major appeal for information
before the body was found.
Superintendent Mike McAuley, sub-divisional commander for the
district, said: ''There was no fear at that time in my mind that he had
been murdered.''
Pressed by journalists, he said there was no record of Darren being
reported missing previously and he did not think the media should have
been involved earlier.
However, there were unconfirmed reports that some of those involved in
the investigation were angry that publicity had not been sought within a
short time of the boy's disappearance.
No RUC officer was prepared to comment last night.
Detective Superintendent Sam Kincaid, the man leading the team of 20
in the murder inquiry, said Darren was ''killed by a blow to the head''.
He declined to comment on a possible motive and said police had
''other evidence we would wish to retain for investigative reasons''.
Meanwhile, police have launched an information campaign and produced
leaflets bearing photographs of Darren and the clothing he was wearing
when last seen -- a black Liverpool shirt, black tracksuit bottoms, and
size seven or eight training shoes.
They also organised a reconstruction of the last time Darren was seen
by his mother at Antrim's Castle shopping centre at 7.30pm last Friday.
Superintendent Kincaid commented that in Northern Ireland such events
happened very rarely but when they did the police and public working
together usually brought those responsible to justice quickly.

<HEADLINE>Compensation is cut for Mod administrator</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AN Comunn Gaidhealach director and Mod administrator Donnie MacLean
won his unfair dismissal claim on procedural grounds, it was revealed
yesterday.
However, an industrial tribunal's written decision has attacked ''his
evasiveness in responding to some of the simplest questions'', and held
him 65% to blame for his sacking. This cut his #25,114 compensation
award to #8788.
Mr MacLean, of Back, Isle of Lewis, was dismissed for gross misconduct
on March 29, 1994, after 17 years with An Comunn, which promotes Gaelic
language and culture.
In October 1993, the National Mod was held in Airdrie and turned into
a financial disaster, especially for the Fringe events, with audiences
not materialising mainly because of lack of accommodation.
At the end of the Mod, Mr MacLean purchased four items of silverware,
including a Christmas present for his wife. The invoice for the
jewellery was later submitted and paid by An Comunn.
In December 1993, Mr Donald John MacSween was appointed An Comunn's
chief executive.
Because of the losses at Airdrie, a meeting was called on January 10,
1994, but when Mr MacLean arrived he was handed a letter suspending him,
told to clear his desk, and the office door lock was changed.
When he collected his belongings next day, Mr MacLean put a bag on his
desk containing the four items of jewellery purchased at Airdrie Mod,
including his wife's Christmas present.
Three days later, Mr MacLean's sister appeared at the Stornoway office
with an envelope containing #100 in payment for a typewriter which was a
Christmas present for her brother's daughter and she asked the receipt
to be backdated to January 9.
Mr MacLean was asked to a meeting on March 17 and later received a
dismissal letter, sacking him for gross misconduct and listing five
grounds.
These were: the purchase of the jewellery, the removal of the old
electric typewriter from the Stornoway office, failing to provide proper
financial reports, failing to arrange written contracts, which
contributed to the Airdrie Fringe losses, and the losses, for which Mr
MacLean was held directly responsible.
The tribunal stated that Mr MacLean's conduct ''if not amounting to
deception'' was ''so recklessly lax'' that his dismissal was fair.
However, the tribunal said the Airdrie losses ''could not be directly
attributed'' to Mr MacLean and added they didn't hold him responsible
for failing to provide proper financial reports or written contracts.
In deciding whether An Comunn had acted reasonably or unreasonably in
its dismissal decision, the tribunal noted that Mr McSween had Mr
MacLean ''in his sights'' even before he took up his post and ''an
intention to dismiss him was evident''.
''The haste with which the applicant was bundled out of the
organisation, the locks changed, and an audit instructed without any
discussion having taken place with him bore out that view.''
In all the circumstances, the tribunal found that Mr MacLean's
dismissal was procedurally unfair and his ''substantial'' contribution
to his sacking was set at 65%.
The tribunal ruled against reinstatement because of the degree of Mr
MacLean's contribution to his sacking and his own admission he ''would
find it difficult to be dictated to by another individual whose
experience and, indeed, commitment to the Gaelic language may be
inferior to his own''.

<TEXT>
BARONESS Thatcher yesterday repeated her call for the arms embargo on
Bosnia to be lifted claiming that keeping it was ''immoral'' and ''quite
possibly illegal''.
The former Prime Minister bitterly attacked the United Nations appeal
for calm in the former Yugoslavia and said arguments against ending the
weapons ban were as ''logically flawed as they are morally repulsive''.
She dismissed suggestions that lifting the embargo would lead to a
wider Balkan war as ''nonsense'', in a speech to the Aspen Institute in
the US state of Colorado.
She condemned Defence Secretary Michael Portillo's call earlier this
week to the allies to ''avoid throwing petrol on the flames'' by backing
US Senate calls to end the ban. It was ''an excuse for muddled
thinking,'' she declared.
She insisted aggressors must never be appeased.
''The longer you put off the needed decision and action the higher the
price in blood which has to be paid.
''In the Gulf War we remembered that lesson and the aggressor was
defeated.
''But it has been abandoned in the case of Bosnia. The Serb aggressor
is being appeased, while we do not even allow the Bosnians to be
supplied with the arms with which to defend their homes, their women and
their children.
Lady Thatcher warned that the allied weakness in the Balkans could
have dangerous and unpredictable consequences elsewhere.
In the history of injustice, the Serb aggressor had descended to the
depths of brutality no one thought to see again, let alone in the heart
of Europe, she said.
Moral conscience alone should have prompted a different response, Lady
Thatcher added.

AN Edinburgh man was convicted yesterday of attempting to pervert the
course of justice by trying to intimidate lawyer Nigel Beaumont.
However, Robert King has been cleared of putting the solicitor through
a terrifying ordeal.
Mr Beaumont claimed King burst in when he was interviewing a
prosecution witness for a forthcoming trial and threatened and abused
him.
According to Mr Beaumont, he was ''terrified'' and ''ran for his
life'' when he got the chance to escape.
King, 42, denied the allegations and Sheriff Isobel Poole said she had
doubts over the evidence needed to support Mr Beaumont's claims. She
found one breach of the peace charge against King, of Magdalene Medway,
Edinburgh, not proven.
However, she did find King guilty of trying to intimidate Mr Beaumont
in relation to a forthcoming case and of a breach of the peace when
police arrived to arrest him.
A charge of assaulting Mr Beaumont by grabbing him, pushing him, and
threatening to kill him was dropped by depute-fiscal David Dickson
earlier in the trial.
Sheriff Poole deferred sentence on King for background reports until
August 18.

SCOTTISH Enterprise has received no official bids to take over its
local enterprise companies and said yesterday that the lack of interest
was a clear indication that the Lecs were doing a difficult job well.
The Government-backed agency confirmed that no written indications of
interest for the Lecs had been received as the deadline for bids passed
at 5pm yesterday.
SE invited bids for the three Lecs whose territory was affected by
recent local government boundary changes -- Glasgow Development Agency,
Lanarkshire Development Agency, and Dunbartonshire Enterprise -- on July
14.
The move, which rang alarm bells for officials in a number of Lecs,
was regarded widely as a response to growing disillusionment within the
hierarchy because success in job creation is being buried under
allegations that the Lecs are self-perpetuating secret societies.
The agency had hoped that, by inviting outsiders to take over, it
would end such criticisms and have its contributions to the Scottish
economy fully recognised.
One Lec source said at the time that the move was apparently aimed at
asking the business community ''to put up or shut up'' about issues
which have caused the SE problems.
The Commons Scottish Affairs Committee earlier this year acknowledged
''great concern'' about Scottish Enterprise's accountability. Although
stressing that the system worked well overall, MPs recommended an
overhaul of membership because Lec boards were ''self-selecting'' and
local authorities in particular were under-represented.
They also proposed replacing Lec directors with ''young, active
people'' to ensure the companies did not stagnate.
Confirmation that there were no bids will come as a relief to senior
staff, many of whom feared that, if present board members were removed,
they might face the same fate.
SE said yesterday that it was not surprised by the lack of bids, given
that the Lecs were up and running and were a doing an ''exemplary'' job.
Mr Gerry O'Brien, a spokesman for the agency, said :''Also I think
what is significant is that increasingly people have begun to recognise
the time and effort that is required by Lec board members in their
commitment to unpaid service, and the very demanding and often thankless
role they perform. I think people don't envy the time and commitment
they have to make.''
He added that the exercise had been useful because it had given people
who had critised the Lecs an opportunity to match their criticism with
action.
''As far as we are concerned, we have always disputed that there was a
cosy relationship -- there are far too many monitoring and audit
mechanisms to permit that -- but we are not closed shop and people can
approach us at any time.
''Of course, we have to weigh promise against performance. Words are
easy but delivery is something else. But in this case the competition
has not materialised.''
Mr O'Brien said there were no plans to publicly advertise for bids for
the other 10 of the 13-strong Lec network but stressed that that was not
to say groups in particular communities could not approach SE with a
view to being considered to replace existing boards.
He also dismissed the suggestion that too little time was given for
potential bidders, as SE had sought only notification of interest and
not detailed business plans.
SE has created 5000 business ventures and secured #150m worth of
exports and #44m worth of European funding for projects this year. Its
inward investment arm, Locate in Scotland, created or safeguarded 12,000
jobs.

THE electricity distribution industry in England and Wales is under
siege from a variety of predators. Almost all the companies in the
sector are targets or potential targets. That situation has not changed
to any significant degree as a result of the decision yesterday by
Trafalgar House, owner of the QE2 and the Ritz Hotel, to abandon its
interest in taking over Northern Electric. Trafalgar was the first
corporate raider to spot the attractions of acquiring one of the
regional electricity companies, but the intervention of the industry
regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, stymied its first tilt at its
prey. Subsequent bids for other electricity companies, notably Hanson's
agreed offer earlier this week for Eastern, have made it too expensive
for Trafalgar, which expects to incur losses this year, to return to the
fray. It claimed that the opportunity to acquire Northern on terms
favourable to both Trafalgar and Northern shareholders has disappeared
and blamed the harsh effect on Northern of the professor's revised price
controls. Other predators, including ScottishPower which has made a
hostile bid for Manweb, will not be deterred. The new regime of price
controls was in place before they made their moves. An American power
company has mounted a bid for South-Western, and there is widespread
speculation that other American and German companies are ready to
pounce. London Electricity could be the next victim.
The key question is whether any or all of these bids should be
referred to the Monopolies Commission. ScottishPower's bid has been
identified as being a matter of special public interest since the effect
of its success would be to reduce by one the number of electricity
distribution companies in the UK. So far the other bidders are either
foreign companies or UK companies with no interest in electricity. The
fact too that ScottishPower is a generator as well as a distributor is
seen as a threat south of the Border where the generators are separate
entities from the distributors. The arguments being used to block
ScottishPower's bid are not very convincing, however. The electricity
market in England and Wales is separate from the one in Scotland.
ScottishPower is a low-cost producer promising a more efficient Manweb.
This should be of benefit to Manweb's customers as well as the
shareholders in both companies.
It would be ironic indeed if foreign companies were given the go-ahead
to bid for electricity companies, but a bid by a Scottish company was
referred to the Monopolies Commission. Electricity distribution in
England and Wales is fragmented and might benefit from a limited process
of mergers, creating strong players able to participate effectively in
the limited competition possible within the industry. The very fact that
the companies are so small partly explains the vulnerability of the
sector. ScottishPower takes the view that it had to expand. Otherwise in
time it too could become the victim of takeover. The generation business
is much more heavily concentrated. This was inevitable but it is
significant in the context of the current spate of bids that generation
accounts for the bulk of electricity costs. The distribution companies
in England and Wales have hardly been successful in building up loyalty
among their customers or their shareholders. Yet there is always the
inclination to prefer the devil one knows. On the other hand it seems
improbable that the sector can escape the pressures for rationalisation
and change. If the authorities decide that it is appropriate for the
Monopolies Commission to have its say, then all the bids should be
referred. To single out the ScottishPower bid as the only one would be
irrational and discriminatory. There is a much better case, indeed quite
a compelling one, for no references at all.

LOTHIAN and Borders police last night indicated there was a ''strong
possibility'' it would chair a meeting of 10 police forces interested in
questioning triple paedophile murderer Robert Black.
Four forces -- Hampshire, Devon and Cornwall, the RUC, and the Garda
-- are currently considering making requests to talk to Black about
unsolved cases in their areas.
Their interest follows a recent invitation by Lothian and Borders, on
behalf of the six forces involved in apprehending the killer, to all UK
and Eire forces who wished to meet and discuss interviewing Black.
A Lothian and Borders spokeswoman said: ''Four forces have expressed
an interest and there is a strong possibility a meeting, chaired by
Lothian and Borders, will go ahead.
''However, no definite decisions to interview Black have been made yet
and a meeting depends on a number of factors, including Black himself.''
Hampshire Police last night said it believed the killer could have
information regarding 14-year-old Marion Crofts, who was murdered in
Fleet in 1981.
A Garda spokeswoman said the force ''has been in touch with Lothian
and Borders about Black regarding unsolved crimes in the Republic of
Ireland''.
It is believed to be interested in questioning Black about the case of
Mary Boyle, who was seven when she went missing from her home in
Ballyshannon in 1987.
Black, 47, was given 10 life sentences in 1994 for the murders of
five-year-old Caroline Hogg, Susan Maxwell, 11, and Sarah Harper, 10,
and the kidnapping of Teresa Thornhill, then 15.
The six forces involved in apprehending Black, a van driver, were
Lothian and Borders, Northumbria, West Yorkshire, Staffordshire,
Nottinghamshire, and Leicestershire.

<HEADLINE>Conservative MP spotlights case against Labour leader and his deputy John Prescott. Blair rebuked for Concorde trip</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977043596</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Tony Blair and his deputy John Prescott yesterday
escaped punishment for failing to declare free trips in the register of
MPs' interests.
Issuing merely a mild rebuke, the Commons Committee on Members'
Interests said the pair had been ''mistaken'' in not registering the
trips.
However, it added: ''We do not consider that either case constitutes a
sufficiently serious breach of the rules to warrant further action by
the House.''
The main claim against Mr Blair was that he failed to declare an
expenses-paid visit on Concorde to the United States, when he was
Labour's junior Treasury spokesman in 1986.
Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP for Dover, who made the initial
complaint against Mr Blair, was furious that he had escaped punishment.
He demanded that the controversy be referred to the Commons for debate
on further action.
''There should be a punishment. I would say a fine or suspension,'' he
told PA News.
''It is embarrassing for Mr Blair. He has been found guilty of making
a mistake. It is a clear breach of the rules by the leader of a
political party.''
However, Mr Blair's office brushed off the incident in a statement,
saying: ''This was always a politically-motivated complaint by David
Shaw and we welcome the fact that the committee has decided to take no
action.''
Labour committee member Angela Eagle also played down the matter.
''This is a very minor technical breach of the rules which even the
committee -- which has an inbuilt Conservative majority -- has
recommended there should be no further action on,'' she said.
Mr Blair told the committee that he had not registered the trip to
Washington because he regarded it as quasi-official and affording no
conceivable personal benefit.
Tory MP Sir Michael Grylls, who led the delegation, had also not
registered the trip.
The cross-party delegation went to lobby against the double taxation
of British companies in the US. Their expenses were paid by the Unitary
Tax Campaign.
Yesterday's report said Mr Blair should have registered the trip and
that this view had been reinforced because he later tabled a Commons
motion on the subject in 1987.
The committee acknowledged there had been ''widespread
misapprehension'' over the rules.
Nevertheless, it stressed: ''Any overseas visit . . . must be
registered if it relates to membership of the House and the cost is not
wholly borne by the member or out of UK public funds.''
Mr Shaw had also complained about Mr Blair's failure to declare a
weekend stay with his wife Cherie at Gleneagles Hotel, Perthshire, in
1989, sponsored by oil firm Conoco, to attend a seminar on the energy
industry.
The complaint against Mr Prescott centred on a similar weekend seminar
which he attended with his wife Pauline at Gleneagles Hotel, also
sponsored by Conoco, in 1994. Mr Shaw claimed the stay had not been
registered at the appropriate time.
The report said few of the ''numerous participants from all political
parties'' who had attended Conoco-sponsored seminars at the hotel had
registered them.
However, it said the cost of a weekend for two at Gleneagles Hotel is
far above the #160 threshold for declaring hospitality and should have
been registered.
Mr Shaw also highlighted Mr Blair's participation in a conference in
Athens in 1993 which, he said, had not been registered quickly enough.
The report reminded MPs of the need to notify the register within four
weeks of a declarable overseas visit.

<RECORDNO>977043597</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A 30-YEAR-OLD man appeared in court yesterday charged with the murder
of seven-year-old Sophie Hook.
Mr Howard Hughes, of Yerburgh Avenue, Colwyn Bay, about four miles
from the Llandudno beach where the girl's body was found, also faces two
charges relating to indecent photographs of children.
It is alleged the unemployed part-time gardener took indecent photos
of a child under the age of 16 in Colwyn Bay on or about February 1995.
He is accused of having indecent photos of a child under 16 with him in
Colwyn Bay on August 2 this year.
Mr Hughes, at around 6ft 3ins, towered over the two plainclothes
police officers who flanked him in the dock.
The chairman of the magistrates, Mr John Anderson, remanded him in
custody until August 9 but ruled that he need not appear before the
court again in person until August 30.
Prosecutor Ms Karen Dixon's application for a remand in custody was
not opposed by Mr Hughes's solicitor, Mr Ray Woodward.
Mr Hughes earlier ran the gauntlet of a screaming crowd of about 100
as he arrived at court. People jeered and shouted ''animal'' and
''beast'' while some kicked the police car carrying him the 150 yards
from Llandudno police station to the court. Mr Hughes sat under a
blanket in the back of the vehicle.
Throughout the four-minute hearing, he remained with his head bowed.
Dressed in a T-shirt and track-suit trousers, he spoke only to confirm
his name, address, and date of birth.
Mr Hughes, who has been held for questioning since Sunday, was charged
late last night shortly after reports that Sophie's nightdress had been
found in undergrowth in Craig-y-Don, three-quarters-of-a-mile from the
garden where she was last seen alive.
The crowd had swollen to 350 by the time Mr Hughes left the court
building. He was kept there for more than one hour after his brief
appearance while two riot vans and up to 40 police were brought in to
clear a way for his removal.
There were shouts of ''animal'' and ''hang him'' as he left in the
back of a police car, again huddled beneath a blanket. Stones were
hurled at the car and one woman was held back by a policeman as she made
a bid to get to it.
A police spokesman said Mr Hughes would be taken to Risley or Walton
prisons.
Sophie disappeared in the early hours of Sunday morning while spending
the night camping in the back garden of her uncle Danny Jones's
Llandudno home. She had been allowed to camp out with sister Jemma and
cousin Luke, both aged nine, in the tent which Luke had been given for
his birthday that day.

A new study blames poor childhood diet for an asthma explosion, says
Chris Holme
ASTHMA could soon be the norm rather than the exception among Scottish
primary children, according to new research. The study, to be published
in the next few months, shows the incidence has doubled in the past five
years among children in Aberdeen. Now one in five children suffers from
the disorder and nearly 30% reported some milder form of wheezing.
It is a follow-on from earlier studies which reported a 5% incidence
in 1964 rising to 10% in 1989. If the increase continues at the same
rate, the majority of primary children will be sufferers within the next
decade.
Dr George Russell, consultant in medical paediatrics at the Royal
Aberdeen Children's Hospital, said it was clear there was now a growing
epidemic of asthma.
''Our results suggest that asthma is not quite becoming the norm, but
it is looking that way. We are almost at the stage of asking why someone
has not got asthma, and if the rate of growth continues we will be in
really big trouble.''
The Aberdeen results confirm the widely suspected view that the asthma
epidemic remains grossly under-reported.
Hospital admissions in Scotland have more than doubled in the past 15
years but have stayed constant around the 10,000 mark since 1990.
Similarly, deaths from the condition have been reduced from a peak of
196 in 1982 to 119 last year.
Applying the Aberdeen results elsewhere should be approached with a
measure of caution, since international protocols for asthma research
were only adopted last year.
However, Dr Russell said there was no reason to suppose the same
picture was not being repeated throughout the country. Studies last year
indicated higher incidence of the disorder among children in rural areas
of the Highlands, and particularly on Skye, than in cities like Aberdeen
or Cardiff, where traffic pollution is much greater.
This overturns the traditional explanation that exhaust emissions are
solely responsible. While there is ample evidence that hot weather, and
higher levels of ozone, nitrogen oxide, and other pollutants make asthma
worse for sufferers, there is little to suggest they are the cause.
Whatever the explanation, the explosion in asthma among children has
been mitigated by advances in therapy and more importantly better
treatment through specialist nurses and doctors in general practice and
patients managing their own conditions.
The problem of today's children is tomorrow's Treasury nightmare.
Treating the epidemic currently costs the NHS #500m a year, including
the drugs bill.
Most asthmatics in childhood remain symptomatic in adult years, as
follow-up studies on the original Aberdeen group from 1964 established.
Dr James Friend, consultant in thoracic medicine, who carried these out,
said it underlined the pressing need for research to find a cure.
''While management of the disease has improved there still disasters
and a few people with exceptionally brittle asthma are at considerable
risk.
''Obviously we would like to prevent the onset of asthma but until we
know what causes it, that is going to be very difficult.''
The complexity of that task is mirrored in the great variety of
explanations. Central heating, double glazing, and fitted carpets have
removed draughts from our homes but also added to humidity and provide
conditions in which the dust mite thrives.
The workplace also provides a variety of triggers and this accounts
for an estimated 1500 new cases a year, and if pollution and exhaust
emissions have been displaced as the sole culprit, they clearly are
implicated in how the disease develops.
Smoking in pregnancy is also implicated. Where there is a family
history of asthma, Dr Friend says it is not a good idea to have cats or
dogs in the house of a new-born baby.
A new dietary explanation has been put forward by Professor Anthony
Seaton, also from Aberdeen. Experiments have shown that the disorder can
flourish when levels of antioxidants are low. This would seem to
correlate with the increasingly poor diet of children and poor intake of
fruit and vegetables which are rich in the antioxidant vitamins A, C,
and E.
This theory has yet to be fully evaluated but Dr Russell, for one,
reckons it shows promise.

A FATHER who killed his baby daughter in a fit of temper when she
would not stop crying was jailed for two years yesterday.
Samuel Reid admitted attacking five-month-old Natalie at the family
home in Linghope Place, Wishaw, Lanarkshire, on February 4 this year
when the child's mother, Ms Marilyn Allardice, was at the dentist.
Lord Gill told Reid, 25, at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday:
''The court must pass a sentence which marks the fact that you took the
life of a defenceless child whom it was your duty to protect.''
The judge said that, according to reports provided for the court, the
injury to the baby was the result of a single impulsive moment of stress
and he was prepared to assess sentence on that basis.
''I also consider it to be important that your intellectual capacity
is severely impaired and, but for that fact, the sentence of the court
in this case would have been considerably greater.
''In your favour, I take into account that up to the time of this
incident you had been affectionate towards the child and you will have
to live with the memory of what you have done for the rest of your life.
''Nothing I can do in this court today can lessen the grief that you
have caused to many people, not least to Marilyn Allardice and her
family. She too is a victim of this crime.''
The judge said he had been urged to put Reid on probation but, having
considered the matter very carefully, he was not satisfied that would be
an appropriate disposal.
The judge had deferred sentence overnight after being told at the High
Court in Airdrie that Reid shoved the baby against a settee then shook
her violently. Minutes later, he walked to a neighbour's house holding
the girl, saying: ''Do something with her. She's not breathing.''
The girl was taken to Law Hospital, Carluke, and later transferred to
Yorkhill Hospital, Glasgow, suffering from severe cerebral bruising. She
died from her injuries on February 8.
Lord Gill was told that Reid snapped because his daughter would not
stop crying. He lifted her to try to get her to stop but this only made
her worse.
He shoved her against the settee, which caused her head to hit a
wooden frame and resulted in a hairline fracture of the skull.
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defence counsel, said the fracture would have
healed in a couple of days but Reid then shook the child through a
mixture of ignorance and panic.
Mr Findlay told the court that Reid had suffered head injuries in a
road accident when he was five and this had left him with a mental
handicap and an IQ of 71.
Lord Gill backdated the two-year sentence to February when Reid was
taken into custody and originally charged with murder.
Asked for her reaction to the sentence, Ms Allardice said: ''I
honestly don't know how I feel at the moment.''
Later, she said: ''I feel it is too lenient for what he has done.
Natalie was only five months old and for a judge to turn round and say
two years . . . it does not seem very long for taking a baby's life. I
would have thought double that.''

AN unholy row involving church-goers in Paisley has forced local
authority officials to change the name of a council-run bar.
Leisure chiefs caused a stir when they named the licensed bar of the
Arts Centre ''Rev Spoons'' after the town's most famous clergyman, the
Rev John Witherspoon, who signed the American Declaration of
Independence.
A strict teetotaller, he was a former minister at the Laigh Kirk which
now houses the centre, in New Street, Paisley, and a leading figure in
the temperance movement.
His fire and brimstone sermons were legendary and once from the pulpit
he denounced the notorious Hell Fire Club as ungodly.
After the new bar had been named, letters of complaint and phone calls
were received from irate church-goers. Within days, the name was
dropped.
District councillor Bobby Stevenson, who is convener of the local
authority's leisure services committee, confirmed yesterday that he had
been forced to step in as a result of the furore.
He said: ''Some saw the funny side but others were decidedly unhappy
over this choice of name for the drinks area.
''I received phone calls and letters from members of the public who
were quite dismayed.
''It was totally inappropriate for the bar to be named after one of
Paisley's most prominent figures, especially one who was a minister and
involved in the temperance movement.
''As soon as I realised the scale of opposition, I told them to get it
changed right away.''
Arts Centre staff will now launch a competition asking local people to
submit an acceptable name. One joker has already suggested The Storm In
A Teacup.

ADVERTISING watchdogs are to investigate a Condom Week campaign
featuring a picture of the Pope.
Posters carrying the picture and saying: ''Eleventh Commandment --
Thou shalt always wear a condom,'' have been sent all over Britain and
have outraged the Roman Catholic church and its supporters.
The British Safety Council admitted it deliberately chose the image to
fuel controversy ahead of the launch of its eighth national condom week
on Monday.
The campaign is backed by Prime Minister John Major, The Chippendales
male dance group, and comedians Jimmy Tarbuck and Lily Savage.
Yesterday, the Advertising Standards Authority said it would
investigate the posters.
''It is our job to investigate anything which might cause serious
offence on the grounds of race, religion or sex,'' said a spokesman.
Ms Fiona Harcombe, one of the campaign's organisers, said: ''We have
achieved what we set out to do -- not to upset Roman Catholics but to
stimulate debate.
''The Roman Catholic Church is responsible in catholic societies for
the spread of sexually transmitted diseases because of its refusal to
allow the use of condoms.''
However, Father Gerry Stamon, of the Catholic Media Office, said: ''It
is very insensitive and will be very offensive to Roman Catholics. It is
misleading and ridicules the catholic view.''
The Universe, the catholic weekly newspaper, has appealed to the five
million Roman Catholics in Britain to write to the Prime Minister
complaining.
In an open letter, it says that if the poster is not withdrawn, Mr
Major must dissociate himself from the campaign or explain why he felt
it was right to associate himself with the mockery of a much-loved and
well-respected religous leader.
Cardinal Basil Hume, the Archbishop of Westminster and leader of the
Roman Catholic community in England and Wales, wrote to Dr Douglas
Latto, chairman of the council, to express his ''shock and repugnance''
at the poster.
''I find it extraordinary that those responsible for any charitable
body should feel that funding a poster with such a cheap and grotesque
caricature of the Pope was an appropriate use of charitable funds,'' he
said.
The Roman Catholic church's teaching was that sex was safer in
marriage. ''You may disagree but you are not entitled to support your
standpoint by ridiculing the Pope,'' added the archbishop.

When I know the record is on, it will be chest up, lean back, and ugly
face going all down the straightway
MORE than a decade ago, Carl Lewis stood on the threshold of what was
to become the greatest athletics career in history. He had just broken
two of the legendary Jesse Owens' college records, but never believed he
would become a corporate icon, the focus of hundreds of millions of
dollars in advertising.
His sport was still nominally amateur. Eighteen Olympic and World
Championship gold medals and 21 world records later, Lewis has become
the richest man in the history of track and field -- a
multi-millionaire.
His imperial presence, even now in its last days of decline, still
attracts global media attention.
More than 20 TV channels and dozens of radio stations jostled with
some 500 journalists yesterday, hanging on his every word on the eve of
the fifth World Athletics Championships in Gothenburg. But many as the
hacks were who buzzed round Lewis's failing carcass, as many again
swarmed to the audience granted by the heir apparent.
If Lewis is track and field's past, then Michael Johnson represents
its future.
It is no exaggeration to say that the 27-year-old Texan holds the fate
of next year's Atlanta Olympics in his hands. And it all hinges on his
ability to be the first man to win the world 200 and 400-metres titles
next week.
Athletics, despite its domination by Americans, does not fire US
public imagination. But it is the main Olympic sport, the one which has
persuaded TV companies to part with more than $400m for the rights.
The Olympic TV signal will reach more than 200 countries and a global
audience in excess of 4000 million which is the target for next week's
championships in Sweden.
Corporate America needs a figurehead to ensure the Games command
sufficent status to be a financial success. To do that, the marketing
machine must promote a successor to Lewis. Johnson is not just the most
likely candidate -- he is the only candidate.
In addition to attempting a unique 200m and 400m double, Johnson is
also in line for a third gold, as a member of the US 4 x 400m relay
squad.
Already the timetable of next year's Olympic track programme,
responding to corporate and TV pressures -- though the International
Olympic Committee would deny it -- has been modified to encourage
Johnson to double up in pursuit of what would also be a unique Olympic
men's double. (Valerie Briscoe-Hooks achieved it for women in 1984.)
Johnson says the rest, which the change gives, is insufficient to
convince him he should try. But if he succeeds next week -- eight races
in seven days, excluding the relay -- the IOC will almost certainly give
way.
''I'm aware the American marketing machine needs a figurehead, a
successor to Lewis,'' said Johnson yesterday. ''The thought does not put
pressure on me, but I hope to become that figure. However it is
important for all American athletes to do well here, for marketing
purposes. I think they are aware of the responsibilities.''
He denied he was trying to persuade the IOC to change the Atlanta
programme by his personal crusade for the double in Sweden: ''Winning
the world 200 and 400m titles has been a long-term goal. Usually I have
to make a choice between one event or the other. Here, I can enjoy
myself. But of course, I hope the IOC will change the Atlanta
programme.''
And if it doesn't? ''Which ever race I don't win will be a joke.''
Waco, his home town, is best known for the infamous siege prompted by
David Koresh and his followers. But Johnson is proud of his roots, and
of his parents, who, he said, imbued in him the proper values of life.
''Nobody knows what kind of person their kid will become, but I think
my folks did a pretty good job.''
Michael's father is a truck driver, his mother a primary school
teacher. All five children, of whom Michael is the youngest, graduated
with college degrees -- two teachers, a Government investigator, and a
computer expert.
''I wanted to make sure that Michael and the others got the education
I never had,'' said his father, Paul. His mother, Ruby, used to coach
her children in the subjects they would encounter the following term.
His parents' reward is that Michael has bought them a house -- a fact
which, to his credit, he never mentions.
Unlike some celebrities, he seems unfailingly helpful. Recently, he
was telephoned in America by a British journalist: ''Sorry, I have
friends in. I'll call you in an hour.''
A certain brush off? Johnson called back promptly, and would not even
let the reporter call him back. ''I earn enough to afford a phone
call,'' he said warmly. Forty minutes later they were still talking. No
UK journalist will hold his breath waiting for Linford Christie to do as
much.
On another occasion, an American friend of mine visited him, and left
some research data on the roof of his car as he drove off. Johnson spent
an hour driving round Dallas, searching.
Yet the pressure on Johnson to perform, both on and off the track, is
intense. The media queues get longer, the lunatic inquiries more
bizarre.
Yesterday an Italian journalist launched a monologue, citing Pietro
Mennea (the world 200m record holder) as saying Johnson would never beat
his mark until he ate more bread.
Johnson listened politely, sweating under gleaming arc lights. The
Italian waited, looking perplexed. ''Sorry, what is the question?''
asked Johnson.
''Will you be taking Mennea's advice? Eating bread to get the world
record?''
Still smiling and civil, Johnson replied: ''I don't care about the
world record here, only about winning.''
Thrice in the previous 20 minutes, he had said the world record does
not matter at these championships. Privately, he says 43 seconds,
possibly even 42, is possible. The current world record is 43.29.
Such personal insights tell more about the man than bald statistics.
But these, too, are impressive.
Johnson has won his last 45 successive 400m finals -- unbeaten since
he lost to Antonio MacKay, in February, 1989. He has run inside 44
seconds seven times. His nearest rival, Quincy Watts, has done so only
four times.
Johnson, first man ever to be ranked world No 1 for both 200m and 400m
in the same season, has now done so thrice: 1990, 1991, and 1994. He is
the only man to have run the 200m in under 20 seconds and the 400m
inside 44.00. He has also run 10.3 for the 100m, and has been timed in
training at 18 seconds for a flying 200m, which is well inside the world
record.
When Johnson won the 1991 world 200m title, it was by the widest
winning margin since the adoption of fully-automatic electronic timing
became the norm at the Helsinki Olympics in 1952. And when he took the
world 400m title two years ago in Stuttgart, that, too, was by the
biggest margin ever.
What is most surprising is that he has achieved this with a style
which is all his own.
He has a majestic upright stature. His upper torso barely seems to
move. One gets the impression he could carry a tray of drinks, olives,
cocktail sticks and all, like a waiter, round the arena on his 400-metre
sorties. Cartoon devotees would liken him to the Roadrunner: motionless
torso, whirling legs.
He defies the accepted sprinting norm: that knee-lift is the sine qua
non. His is almost non-existent. But his rapid, economic stride shuttles
him round in breathtaking fashion. The overworked adjective awesome
might have been coined for Michael Johnson.
Most experts are people who make the difficult seem easy. Johnson also
defies that rule. His style, like a regimental sergeant major with a
ramrod down his back, makes running fast seem impossible.
But he is immune to jokes about this style: ''No coach has ever tried
to change it,'' he said.
Clyde Hart, his long-time coach, added: ''It could be that the others
have got it wrong. They could be spending too much energy going up and
down.''
John Isaacs, one of Britain's leading sprint coaches is totally
bemused. ''How does he run so fast? God knows.''
But those who matter in America know he is the corporate dream. If one
was unaware Johnson had a marketing degree, one would very soon guess.
When asked for the title of the last film or TV programme he had
watched, he could offer none. Favourite book?
Promptly: ''The history of the Nike company.'' (Nike is his shoe
sponsor.)
Yet he was only taken on the track team at college to make up the
relay squad. He also knows disappointment. A broken leg almost ended his
career, and a gastric upset, which caused him to lose a stone in a week,
cost him the Olympic crown in Barcelona.
''Winning another 200m or 400m title does not excite me,'' he said,
explaining his obsession with the double. ''But being No 1 in both, and
winning the World Championship in each, is the next logical step to
winning both at the Olympics.''
He believes the world record in both the 200m (19.27) and 400m (43.29)
will be his. ''But not here in Sweden, not with four rounds in each
event.''
He began this season with a world indooor record at 400m -- the first
man to break 45 seconds, when he clocked 44.97 in Reno, Nevada. Just 22
days later he scythed that mark, with 44.63, in Atlanta.
The US Championships, the American trials to select the team for the
World event in Gothenburg, were remorseless. The American way is to
select the first three past the post, without exception or deference to
previous form. Thus Lewis, thrice world 100m champion, was left off the
100m roster when he failed to finish in the first three.
Johnson gambled by tackling both events, as he had to do, in order to
fulfil his dream. He won both, the first American since Maxie Long, in
1899, to do so.
His 400m victory at these trials, in Sacramento, was one of the most
notable runs ever. He reached 200m in 21.5 -- fast enough to have won
the Scottish title for that distance seven times in the past decade.
Then he accelerated through the next 100m in 10.3. That time would have
taken the Scottish 100m title nine times in the past 10 years.
He came home in 43.66, the fourth quickest ever. But
uncharacteristically, with Butch Reynolds' world record at his mercy,
Johnson stuck out his arms, aircraft style, pretending to touch down as
he approached the line.
''I was not on world record pace,'' he insisted. ''I would have
regretted showboating if I had been. If I had run through the finish, I
think it would have been 43.4.
''I have seen the clock when I was running as hard as I could, and how
fast those hundredths tick off. To me, whether it is 43.4, or 43.6 does
not matter. It does not matter to me unless it's 43.2, and I take down
Reynolds' record.
''When I know the record is on, it will be chest up, lean back, and
ugly face going all down the straightway.''
Two days later, he was also 200m champion, having recorded 19.84,
though helped by a tailwind of 3.5-metres per second.
Ollan Cassell, the executive director of US Track and Field, the
sport's governing body in America, said these two performances had
supplanted Lewis, who made the world team only as a long jumper: ''I
think this places Johnson up there with Jesse Owens, in that
stratosphere.''
Johnson will be delighted it is so. He said as much three years ago,
and forcefully, when he beat Lewis in the 200m at the US Olympic trials.
Bitchily, the Lewis camp was believed by Johnson to have smeared him
as a drug user -- untrue. He has detested Lewis since: ''Carl has been a
great athlete. But that's past. It's me now.''

Nicholas Budgen attacks Labour's ''confused and contradictory''
attitude towards Britain's part in the EU
ROBIN COOK makes an important attempt in his Herald article yesterday
to explain the position of New Labour on Europe. New Labour is
politically correct -- as indeed is vital if it is to retain the vague
interest of many of the more insecure members of the English middle and
professional classes -- but it is also confused and contradictory.
Cook starts by regretting the complex constitutions and impenetrable
jargon of the European Union. This jargon and this written constitution
cannot be just dismissed. It is an expression of the aspiration for a
federal Europe which is widespread among our continental neighbours. It
will not do just to ignore the gobbledygook and then blandly pretend
that the European Union has a different constitution which is more
suited to our people, our history, and our unwritten constitution.
Cook cheerfully promises that Labour will not sign up for a federal
European superstate. Well what on earth does he think we have now? It is
not the Common Market, it is not even the single market as laid down in
1986, it is the Europe of a 1992 treaty on European Union, by which the
nation states resolved, for instance, ''to make a new stage in the
process of European integration undertaken with the establishment of the
European Communities'', and, ''desiring to enhance further the
democratic and efficient functioning of the institutions so as to enable
them to carry out, within a single institutional framework, the tasks
entrusted to them''.
That is part of the opening statement of the Maastricht Treaty.
Perhaps Robin Cook had not read it. If so, he is, as we all know, in
very good company. Then he talks blandly about co-operation. We all want
good relations with Europe. It does not follow that we want this
particular federal structure.
The first priority of the next Labour Government will be jobs. Thus
Cook accepts without criticism a CBI survey. Half of the top 100
exporting firms said their exports would be less secure if there was
doubt over Britain's commitment to Europe. Europe is not the European
Union. We cannot move our island or change our history. We are committed
to Europe. We are not necessarily committed to this form of European
Union.
Labour, in pursuit of the middle ground, is making a familiar mistake.
It is taking its politics from groups with an expertise in other areas.
It did not follow that because the unions were expert in arguments about
conditions of work they knew about the overall management of the
economy. It does not follow that because somebody sells a lot of widgets
to Hamburg they know all about the constitutional arrangements between
Britain and Europe.
It is interesting that Cook says nothing in his article about the
single currency. In its mini-manifesto on this subject Labour says: ''A
single currency could produce significant benefits to the people of
Europe.''
Scotland knows that she suffers a disadvantage already as against
England. She cannot change the value of her currency against the English
currency. The UK compensates Scotland for this disadvantage by spending
more public money north of the Border than in England.
If we were to go into a single currency in Europe, then the outer
areas of Europe -- Scotland, the Mediterranean countries, and Ireland --
would have to receive extra compensation. There would be a massive
increase in the political direction of the economy and as a consequence
even more state fraud. I thought Labour regarded such scandals as
unfortunate and unintended. Maybe it wants extra state funding and it
knows and intends the inevitable disadvantages.
Many of the remaining arguments are really nothing to do with the
European Union. If Labour wants works councils as part of its continuing
obligation to the unions, then let it introduce domestic legislation to
that end. There is no need to have common but high overhead costs of
labour throughout Europe. If our nation chooses to have a Labour
Government, well that's the nation's choice. There is no need to have
permanent socialism with the form of the social chapter imposed upon us
by Brussels.
Again, if Labour wishes to abandon its traditional support for the
Union, the Tories will argue against such a proposal. There is no need
to bring the European Union into the argument. The lander to which Robin
Cook refers are regional governments within a written federal German
constitution which is itself seen by many Germans as part of a written
European federal constitution.
Please read Robin Cook's article again. Goodwill towards our
continental allies and trading partners does not mean we think their
constitutional arrangements are in every way suitable to the proud and
ancient institutions of Scotland, England, and Northern Ireland.
Friendship, goodwill, and common trading interests do not always imply
agreement on the system of government.

<HEADLINE>#5000 reward in bid to catch fish killers</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977043604</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
OWNERS of a Highland rivers system where more than 1000 salmon were
poisoned last week are offering a reward of #5000 for the successful
prosecution of whoever was responsible.
The Kyle of Sutherland Fishery Board, whose interests take in four
top-class angling waters -- the Carron, Cassley, Oykel, and Shin rivers,
all flowing into the Dornoch Firth -- have confirmed to Northern
Constabulary their intention to offer the inducement for a quick
conviction.
One of the Carron proprietors, Mr Jonathan Shaw, of Amat Lodge, said
that a year to the day before the poison discovery at the Glencalvie
Falls pool, an unexplained fire started on the boundary of his estate.
It was put out before doing serious damage but Mr Shaw said: ''It
could easily have been accidental, because we cannot prove that it was
deliberate.''
The word ''think'' was chalked on a rock above one of the affected
river pools and proprietors have no idea to what it refers.
The poisoning has devastated the two-mile stretch of river. All living
creatures in the affected part of the river system are likely to have
been killed so, as well as the loss of individual fish, the freshwater
animals on which they feed will also have been destroyed.
More than 1000 adult salmon and grilse, as well as an unknown number
of wild brown trout, have been affected, and it is thought that it could
take 30 years for the contaminated part of the river to recover fully,
which is bound to have a detrimental effect on the local economy.
''The managers of the River Carron have been making commendable
efforts to enhance the wildlife interest along the length of the river
and it is infuriating that someone can come along and destroy all that
with one mindless act,'' said Sir John Lister-Kaye, chairman of the
north-west region of Scottish Natural Heritage.

RADIO station Scot FM was reprimanded yesterday by broadcast watchdogs
after late night talk show host Scottie McClue insulted gay men and
women.
The Radio Authority criticised the station after the watchdogs said
McClue's comments broke radio codes on sexual stereotyping.
The Radio Authority was called in to investigate McClue's remarks
after a gay caller objected to a reference by McClue to ''poodles for
poofs'' in his show on April 5.
The Radio Authority said: ''We told the complainant we did not condone
homophobia and were swift to act against broadcasts which did.''
The watchdog did not uphold the complaint against the ''poodles for
poofs'' remark but did reprimand Scot FM for other comments against
lesbians made by McClue in the same show.
Mr Tom Hunter, managing director of the station, said last night:
''Scottie is a very controversial presenter but he is also very
humorous. He is certainly not against gays.''
However, the station was able to celebrate an increase in the time
people tune to Scot FM.
Figures produced by RAJAR -- Radio Joint Audience Research -- show
that although overall audience figures dropped by 0.2% to 12.8,
listening time jumped by nearly two points -- dismissing claims from
rivals that people were ''accidentally'' tuning into Scotland's newest
radio station.
One of Scot FM's rivals, Radio Forth, the Edinburgh-based independent
radio company, claimed yesterday that its services had beaten the
combined forces of BBC Radio for the first time.
It said that, according to figures from RAJAR, its two stations, Forth
FM and Max AM, accounted for 36% of radio listening in east central
Scotland.
The total audience of BBC Radios 1, 2, 3, and 4, along with 5 Live and
Radio Scotland, added up to just 35%.
Mr Richard Findlay, Radio Forth managing director, said the audience
increase was right across the listening day, particularly during the
breakfast shows.
Meanwhile, wacky morning disc jockey Chris Evans was hailed as Radio
1's saviour yesterday when new figures showed the station had gained
listeners for the first time in two years.
More than 500,000 more adults tuned in during the second quarter of
this year, taking it to a total adult audience of 11.1 million.
The breakfast show, which Evans took over in April, increased its
total audience by 10%.
Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister said he was ''very pleased'' with
the figures.
However, Evans made survey chiefs fume by pretending to leak the
figures on his show, but he almost doubled them.

TWO workmen were seriously injured when a demolition job went badly
wrong.
The firm carrying out the work, Scotdem Ltd, was fined #10,000 at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday.
Metalwork supporting a protruding structure had been cut away, leaving
what a health and safety inspector described as ''a ticking time bomb''.
When the two workmen began to remove the wall above the structure
brick by brick, it was only a matter of time until the whole thing gave
way.
It fell seven metres, taking foreman George Lawson and Robert Gray
with it.
Mr Lawson had a broken leg and broken ribs. Mr Gray, who was trapped
by a metal beam until freed by firefighters, suffered a shattered
kneecap and injured tendons.
Scotdem, 86-88 Brunswick Street, Edinburgh, admitted a charge under
the Health and Safety at Work Act of failing to provide a safe system of
work for its employees.
It failed to check how the protruding cantilevered structure was
supported and failed to provide temporary support for it during the
demolition.
Depute-fiscal David Dickson said the collapse on September 1, 1994, at
the Maltings, Slateford Road, Edinburgh, had brought down a total of 38
tonnes of debris.
''The men, thankfully, fell on top of the rubble and not underneath,''
said Mr Dickson.
The family-run firm, in existence since 1971, employs 40 people and
has turnover of more than #1.6m. It had been contracted by Barratt to do
demolition work at an old brewery which was being converted into 114
flats.
The firm's solicitor, Mr Malcolm McGregor, said the building was
particularly old and that no plans or drawings of it were available.
Scotdem assumed the protruding structure was supported by beams going
into the wall and not by the metal structure on the other side of the
wall.
Mr McGregor said that an independent safety officer felt Scotdem's
assumption was reasonable in the circumstances.
Sheriff Isobel Poole said the charge was ''very serious''. Imposing a
fine which was half the maximum allowable, she added that she had taken
into account that the firm had never before been convicted.

<HEADLINE>Thomas Campbell tells his lawyer new appeal is only hope for liberty. Killer rejects move for royal mercy</HEADLINE>

THE Ice-Cream War murderer, Thomas Campbell, has rejected a move by
his lawyer to apply for the Royal Prerogative of Mercy.
Campbell was convicted in 1984 of killing six members of the Doyle
family in Ruchazie, Glasgow, at the height of the housing scheme dispute
over ice-cream van territories.
He now subsists on liquid food in Shotts Prison after a series of
partial hunger strikes in pursuit of a new appeal court hearing. He has
told his lawyer, Mr John Carroll, that another appeal is his only hope
for liberty.
It emerged yesterday, however, that his co-accused, Joseph Steel, has
decided to accede to Mr Carrol's request and apply to Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth to have the Royal Prerogative exercised.
A relative of Mr Campbell said yesterday: ''It amounts to Tommy asking
for a pardon but his view is that how can you ask for a pardon for
something that you have not done?''
Mr Carroll said the appeal system in Scotland simply did not allow any
examination of the safety of a conviction, a direct contrast to what
happened in England. The exercise of the Royal Prerogative, he
suggested, was not a pardon for something done but a genuine opportunity
for mercy -- a de facto acquittal.
The Crown had to say they recognised the features which made the
conviction unsafe.
Mr Carroll pointed out to The Herald that the Sutherland Committee,
currently deliberating on the Scottish criminal appeal process, was
examining the English system and pondering whether a move towards a more
overtly fair test was appropriate.
At the moment, the Scottish appeal system is based on a rigid, narrow,
and legalistic interpretation designed to reinforce infallibility rather
than address any vague possibility of a miscarriage of justice.
The key to the Ice-Cream War case, in which Campbell and Steel have
always maintained their innocence, is that the single key witness, a
Glasgow petty criminal, Mr William Love, has since withdrawn his
evidence. The first time he did so was to The Herald.
The trial judge in 1984 said that without accepting Mr Love's
statement implicating the two accused the jury could not convict.
In the last year, Mr Love swore an affadavit to the Crown that his
statement was false but that was rejected on the grounds there was
insufficient reliable evidence. To have accepted the statement would
have meant the Crown accepting at least some police evidence had been
deliberately falsified.
Mr Carroll agreed yesterday that his latest move was in the nature of
a desperate last fling.
''There is no room in the Scottish system for such concepts as
goodwill,'' he said. ''Many people believe we must introduce this and
for the Secretary of State to move forward in this case would be a
start.
''There is a widespread belief throughout the legal profession the
Sutherland Committee is moving towards the English concept of the unsafe
and unsatisfactory conviction.''
Thomas Campbell, now in the second half of his minimum 20-year life
sentence, said yesterday that if Joseph Steel wished to pursue a pardon
for the sake of liberation from solitary confinement then he wished him
good luck.
Steel has escaped twice from prison and returned voluntarily to
demonstrate his innocence -- once chaining himself to Buckingham
Palace's railings, the second time climbing the camera tower in the
Barlinnie Prison car park for television cameras.
He is currently being held in the segregation unit at Greenock prison,
having been moved from segregation at Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow, to
accommodate alleged terrorism suspects.
Campbell said to Mr Carroll in his letter: ''Freedom's just another
word for nothing left to lose, and there is nothing left that they could
do to hurt me, other than kill me . . . and even that would be a
relief.''

THE hotel attached to the Health Care International hospital at
Clydebank has received a top Scottish Tourist Board award.
The 168-bed Beardmore Hotel, which has a swimming pool and
cardio-vascular gym, is one of only 11 hotels in Scotland awarded
five-crown delux status.
The others include Edinburgh's Caledonian and Balmoral hotels, Cameron
House Hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond, Gleneagles Hotel, and the Old
Course at St Andrews.
Scottish Tourist Board's chief executive, Mr Derek Reid, said the
award had been made in recognition of the Beardmore's excellent
facilities and was a considerable achievement for a new establishment.
Since the running of the private hospital was taken over by the Abu
Dhabi Investment Company six months ago, the hotel has attempted to
market itself as a business and conference centre, in addition to
catering for relatives of HCI patients from overseas.
While occupancy rates at HCI have fluctuated around the 70% mark -- 20
patients mainly from Greece, Egypt, and the Middle East are currently
receiving treatment -- a hospital spokeswoman said the hotel had
benefited because many patients had been accompanied by several
relatives.
Acknowledging the hotel was not well known and still in its embryonic
stage, general manager David Clarke pointed out it had the advantage of
being only 15 minutes from Glasgow airport.
He said it had the potential to become one of the country's top luxury
hotels and it was hoped that holidaymakers could be lured to Clydebank.
He added that the hotel was competitively priced, with rooms costing #90
per night.
Mr Clarke, former manager of the Caledonian Hotel, took over at the
Beardmore last month. He would not divulge the number of business
bookings but said most were from companies in the West of Scotland as
well as some medical and pharmaceutical companies associated with HCI.

THE electronics giant Siemens announced yesterday it is to build an
#1100m factory in the north-east of England which will create 2000 jobs.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, who brokered the deal with
the German company to locate its semiconductor fabrication plant in
Newcastle, said the Government was delighted that Britain had won the
deal, adding that he and the Prime Minister had worked hard to persuade
the firm to make the decision.
However, the announcement has come as a blow to Scotland which had
hoped to draw fresh hi-tech investment.
Scottish Enterprise's inward investment arm, Locate in Scotland, had
suggested site options at Eurocentral, the freight terminal at Mossend,
Lanarkshire, and the Sandbank Business Park near Dunoon.
LIS director Martin Togneri said yesterday: ''Naturally, we are
disappointed that Siemens have chosen not to locate their new plant in
Scotland as LIS put a great deal of effort into trying to win the
project, but we were always aware that the company favoured a location
where there were few other companies competing in the same labour skills
markets.
''As Scotland is home to the largest single concentration of
semiconductor companies in Europe with several large semiconductor
plants, two of which announced investments totalling #780m in Scotland
last year, thereby contributing to LIS's most successful year ever, that
was a factor which was always going to be difficult to counter.''
Mr Togneri said the deal was, however, excellent news for Britain
because several European countries also were in the running and said the
investment might bring spin-off benefits to the industry in Scotland.
''Tyneside is an attractive location but it is not Silicon Glen, it
doesn't have anything like the concentration of wafer fabrication
facilities that we have in Scotland, so there will be an opportunity for
companies already in Scotland to trade with the Siemens facility and
provide it with materials or services.''
Mr Heseltine told a London news conference that Britain now saw itself
as the enterprise centre of Europe, adding: ''Siemens' decision has
helped us to prove just how attractive the UK is as a base for the
expansion of manufacturing capability.''
The deal will be scrutinised by the EU's competition watchdog, Karel
van Meirt, to ensure it is not in breach of the Community's trade rules.

THERE are concerns about maintaining school and college examination
marking standards following an announcement of the creation of a new
examination body.
Yesterday, the Scottish Office said the new body would take over the
functions of the Scottish Examination Board at Dalkeith and Scottish
Vocational Education Council in Glasgow. In effect, the SED, a statutory
body, will be wound down once the new body is approved by Parliament.
According to Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson, the new
body will come into operation at the end of the decade along with the
introduction of the qualifications under the Higher Still reforms. He
said the organisation, operating details of which were not released,
would enhance the standing of Scottish qualifications.
''The future prosperity of Scotland demands a well educated and
trained workforce. I will ensure that the new body meets the needs of
all, including employers, schools, educational authorities and all those
who seek a qualification.''
However, Mr Fred Forrester, deputy general secretary of the
Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union, was not reassured and
said he was very concerned that examination standards would be
maintained. The EIS favoured an organisation modelled on the SED system
of subject panels and external marking, he said.
''The announcement is completely predictable since this is the option
the Government favoured. No-one is arguing for two examination bodies,
but it is terribly important what the nature of the new body is. This is
the crucial issue so we will be watching this Bill as it makes its way
through Parliament.''
The Scottish Office was unable to give any guarantees over staffing
levels but said it was unlikely that jobs would be shed.

A BBC radio producer was injured near the summit of Ben Nevis
yesterday while preparing for a live show.
Phil Hughes, producer of Radio 2's afternoon show hosted by Ed
Stewart, slipped on loose rock and broke his leg in two places. He was
airlifted off the summit in a helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth, and flown
to hospital at Fort William.
Despite the accident, Ed Stewart continued his chat show, talking to
climbers and tourists he met on the mountain.

NATIONAL Lottery multi-millionaire Lee Ryan has been warned that he
faces going to jail after being found guilty of handling stolen cars.
Ryan, 32, who now lives in a sprawling Leicestershire farmhouse, in
the village of Osbaston, was convicted on three counts of handling
stolen cars.
Nottingham Crown Court heard that Ryan and co-accused Darren Richards
travelled to Malta to sell a Mercedes 500 SEL and a BMW 325I Cabriolet
for #23,500.
Ryan, who scooped #6.5m on the lottery in March, had denied knowing
that the cars were stolen. Richards, 23, of Wyville Road, Leicester, was
found guilty of two similar charges.
Ryan listened as his long list of previous convictions and jail terms
were listed.
Prosecutor Philip Bown said: ''This man has been before the court on a
regular basis since 1976. His offending in the main has revolved around
motor vehicles, the theft of them, from them, and interspersed with some
criminal damage, burglary and taking away of vehicles without the
owners' consent.''
It took the prosecutor five minutes to list Ryan's 18 previous
appearances in court and the charges he had faced.
The five-day trial has accumulated costs of #10,000 which Ryan is
likely to have to pay.
Adjourning sentencing on Ryan for a month for the preparation of
reports, Recorder Anthony Palmer, QC, told Ryan and Richards: ''I want
to say to you straight away that I consider these crimes so serious only
a custodial sentence can be justified. Don't go away from here thinking
you are likely to get a probation order or something like that.''
Both men were bailed to reappear for sentencing.
The judge had imposed a ban on the reporting of the five-day trial,
ruling that Ryan may not get a fair trial if the jury was aware of his
identity.
Ryan's barrister, Francis Evans, QC, claimed that press reports
surrounding Ryan's affair with a young woman and his lavish lifestyle
may influence their verdicts.
The ban was lifted after Ryan was convicted and Mr Bown told the jury
that Ryan's lifestyle had changed dramatically in the past year.
Ryan's mother, Anne Gumb, said that his wife Karen and his three
children had been told of the court result.
The jury had heard how the two top-of-the-range cars relating to the
charges had false licence plates corresponding to identical cars in the
UK and forged vehicle registration forms and insurance cover notes.
Police who raided Ryan's former council house in Braunstone,
Leicester, found a stolen Ford Transit van outside with a new false
licence plate.
Unemployed Ryan was well-known as a second-hand car dealer who used
the cash to boost his family's #130-a-week benefits. The court heard
that Ryan's home regularly had a fleet of second-hand cars parked
outside with fluorescent ''For Sale'' signs displayed in their windows.
Mrs Ryan attended court on the first day of the trial, but has stayed
away since.
The court's attempts to keep Ryan's identity as a multi-millionare
from the jury were nearly scuppered by a drunk in the public gallery.
On the third day of the trial, a heckler stood up in the small
courtroom as Ryan was giving evidence and shouted: ''Lying bastard. Just
because you've won #6.5m on the lottery, you think you can get away with
it.''
The case was adjourned for 20 minutes but Mr Recorder Palmer decided
that the case should continue.

THE Queen Mother, who was 95 yesterday, spent 45 minutes with a crowd
of well-wishers at Clarence House.
She alternated between sitting and standing with her walking-stick to
receive dozens of cards and bunches of flowers from children.
At Glamis Castle, Forfar, the Queen Mother's family home, hundreds of
well-wishers flocked to to be there on her birthday. One woman, from New
Westminster, British Columbia, dropped in a birthday card at the castle
letterbox.
In London, the Queen Mother emerged smiling from the gates of her home
to watch a march past by a band from the Royal Corps of Signals.
Unsteady on her feet and occasionally clutching at her escort, the Queen
Mother otherwise seemed at ease in the hot summer sun.
Undaunted and eager to talk to her fans, she walked up the road to
greet the waiting crowd, some of whom had travelled from all over the
world to see her.
After an unexpectedly long walkabout of 45 minutes, she was
transported by golf buggy back into Clarence House.
Some of the well-wishers had been camping out for days to be at the
front of the crowd when the nation's favourite royal emerged from her
residence in St James's.
In addition to two march pasts, gun salutes were being held in the
capital to mark the occasion.
The Queen and the Prince of Wales attended a special birthday lunch
party, along with the Queen Mother's great-grandchildren Prince William,
13, and Prince Harry, 10.
Among those who had travelled thousands of miles for the celebrations
was Hirom Kasuga, a 28-year-old teacher from Tokyo, who arrived in the
UK yesterday with her mother.
''Japanese people think she is a very nice lady,'' Miss Kasuga said.
''She has a big heart and a great heart.''
Swede Bertil Lindstrom, a 63-year-old newspaper worker, has been
coming to wish the Queen Mother a happy birthday regularly since 1980.
''I have told her I will come until she is 100,'' he said. First in
the queue was 57-year-old Norman Williams, a retired factory worker from
Wrexham, who arrived at 9am on Wednesday to ensure a prime position.
''I've been coming here since 1969,'' said Mr Williams, who was
presenting the Queen Mother with recent photographs of her family.
It has been an eventful year for the Queen Mother who, despite some
concern for her health, has bounced back and is said to be on
''excellent'' form.
Just last month, she underwent a successful operation at London's King
Edward VII Hospital to remove a cataract from her left eye and correct
failing sight which had compounded her difficulty with walking.
A huge birthday cake has been baked by pastry chefs in Cornwall. The
mixture for the five-tiered cake, decorated with ivory icing and pink
roses, was left to soak in the finest cognac for a week.
However, the heat proved too much for a champagne present destined for
the Queen Mother.
The huge Nebuchadnezzar -- equivalent to 20 ordinary bottles -- blew
up in the face of Guild of Professional Toastmasters life president Ivor
Spencer as he loaded it into the boot of his Jaguar.
Mr Spencer said the ''Neb'' -- traditionally presented by the guild to
the Queen Mother on her birthday -- ''exploded into pieces'' due to the
heat.
The Queen Mother did not have to forgo her present, however.
Mr Spencer, who escaped with cuts to his hand and face, said he must
have sixth sense -- he had bought two of the huge bottles.

APPLICATIONS for grants from Scottish charities looking for cash from
the National Lottery seem to be greatly over-subscribed.
It is believed that up to 1000 different organisations have applied
for a share of the first-phase poverty-linked project pot.
The total cash pay out for the year totals around #29m, but no figure
has yet been reached for the first-phase payouts.
Last night, the director of the Edinburgh-based Scottish office of the
National Lottery Charities Board, Mr John Rafferty, said he could not
comment on exactly how many applications had been received or the amount
of money they had applied for.
However, he did confirm that the first-phase applications, which will
be officially announced on Tuesday, would be very heavily
over-subscribed and it was likely organisations would want a lot more
money than was available to give out.
A final decision on how many of these 1000-plus projects will get cash
aid will be made on October 23. Mr Rafferty admitted the three-strong
Scottish board, made up of Graham Bowie, the former chief executive of
Lothian Regional Council, William Kirkpatrick, a member of the Gaming
Board of Great Britain, and psychology and social sciences lecturer
Philomena de Lima, would have ''difficult choices to make''.
Future payouts will also be done in topic-linked phases, dealing with
such matters as health and disability, young people, training programmes
and other social need projects.
Mr Rafferty said each application from charity groups was being
thoroughly checked by an independent team of experts. It was uppermost
in their mind that the cash was fairly distributed to charities
throughout the country.
He added that it had taken a year to put into place the framework to
deal with applications from Scottish charities.
Mr Rafferty said: ''It is predicted the Treasury will make available
from #250m for distribution for charities, out of which Scotland will
get around 11[1/2]%.
''In just a year, we are now ready to give out our first grants. I
believe that is a magnificent achievement.''
Mr Rafferty said there had been some criticism that it had taken a
long time to give out grants to charity, something they had ''taken on
the chin''.
''We can't have money given out effectively to charities and, on the
other hand, expect organisations to be checked out, applications to be
validated, things to be properly monitored and assessed and for all of
the security needed to safeguard this huge amount of public money put in
place.
''The board in Scotland have a team of assessors, experts in their own
field who have been developing the application and assessment procedure.
''We were new to the field and the expectation is we will give our
grants fairly and efficiently with due regard to public accountability
because we are accountable to Parliament.
''All the systems had to be built. The Charities Board decided not to
take a blunderbuss approach to this and tried to deal with priorities of
social need.
''That choice came not out of the minds of a small group of people on
the board but only after an unprecedented consultation with the
voluntary sector, a National Opinion Poll survey and a series of 70
public meetings in Britain, including Ayr, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen
and Inverness, all within the last year.''
Mr Rafferty added he was conscious there was a public expectation that
they would do the job properly.
''Everybody thinks giving away millions of pounds in Scotland to
charity will be very easy. It is, in fact, very difficult because you
have to ensure the money is being used for good purposes. Also that it
is going to be used by competent organisations for legitimate reasons,
meet social need where it is most needed and put money into the hands of
people who are competent to disimburse it for the greatest benefit for
the people of Scotland.''
He admitted it would be a slow learning process for charities, who may
take some time to get used to working with them. However, he said they
had learned a lot from dealing with first-phase applications.
''I suspect a lot of charities thought they just had to write a
letter, and a lot did, saying what they did and will we give them money.
In fact we needed to know what is the legal basis of their organisation,
do they have a bank account with two signatories, do they have an annual
audit and what exactly are they going to use the money for.''
He said the decision to make poverty the first topic for grant
applications was taken after it was pinpointed by charities themselves
as their main priority.

GLASGOW Celtic were refused a safety certificate yesterday, only 24
hours before the glamour tie against Newcastle at the reopening of their
Parkhead ground.
The hot weather has left the club with a sticky problem -- the
tarmacadam laid at the exits to the new 23,000-seat stand has not set
properly.
Councillors on Strathclyde Region's safety of sports grounds
sub-committee were advised by safety experts that it would be wrong to
give the ground an interim safety certificate while the exits were still
not ready.
However, officials at Celtic said they were confident that contractors
Miller Construction would be able to fix the problem by today -- so a
final decision was postponed until 9 o'clock this morning.
The problems, though, are not seen as insurmountable, so while the
councillors were refusing the certificate, Celtic continued to sell
tickets for the match.
Celtic spokesman Peter McLean insisted: ''The contractor is confident
that we can achieve the remaining items identified by the safety
committee within the time-scale given, to enable the opening to proceed
as planned.''
Councillor David Sanderson, chairman of the committee, said after
spending three hours inspecting the new stand: ''We were very impressed
with the progress of the work and we have been given assurances that
this work will be completed timeously.
''My committee is quite happy to go back tomorrow morning. I don't
foresee any difficulties at this stage.''
The new stand replaces the ''jungle'' terracing opposite the main
stand. Initially, the stand will accommodate 23,000 fans, which will
eventually rise to 26,300. With the 8000 seats in the main stand,
Parkhead's capacity will be 31,000 until further stands are built behind
the two goals.

The Prime Minister and Mrs Major, seen here enjoying the sunshine by
the swimming pool of their villa, are spending two weeks at a secret
destination in the South of France.
Downing Street is refusing to reveal where they are staying or who
they are staying with. There was never any secret about where Baroness
Thatcher went on holiday, and there has not been in the past about where
the Majors have gone.
There is said to be nothing sinister about this unaccustomed
reticence; just that it would be awkward to disclose where they are
beyond confirming that they are in the South of France.
The Majors, who left on holiday last Saturday, will be away for just
over two weeks. Their son James is not with them -- he has already been
on holiday in France -- but their daughter Elizabeth is spending part of
the time with them.

ONE of Scotland's best-known entrepreneurs, Mr Bill Fleming, founder
of the Smiley tyre and exhaust centre chain, has been plunged, together
with his wife Sandra, into personal bankruptcy by the collapse of a new
book retailing business they launched last year.
Problems at Tower Bookshops, with outlets at Newton Mearns, Paisley,
and Glasgow's Union Street, appear to have been the cause.
Accountants KPMG were called in after Tower was declared insolvent.
Sources say the leases on the three shops were cross-guaranteed by
Barncluith, the sixteenth century house and gardens in Hamilton, on the
edge of the Chatelherault country park, which the Flemings bought when
the Smiley business was sold to the German tyre maker, Continental, in
1992.
Since then, Mr Felming's energies have been devoted to restoring the
terraced gardens at Barncluith; playing a business angel role at a
number of small Scottish companies; and launching Tower.
The gardens are among the oldest in Scotland. Although in a state of
serious neglect when the Flemings acquired them, they once boasted palm
trees and peach trees, growing in soil warmed from below by charcoal
burners.
Mr Fleming, an evangelist for more Scots to take the plunge and start
their own businesses, was the first chairman of the Entrepreneurial
Exchange, a body set up last year with Scottish Enterprise support to
help advance that cause.
The son of a joiner, he left school at 16 and seemed destined to
become a works cost accountant. Instead, he was attracted by the
burgeoning 1960s music scene, publishing a magazine called Beat Scene,
promoting pop concerts, and acting as a shore-based publicist for one of
the pirate radio ships, Radio Scotland.
For a time he worked in The Herald's advertising department but the
creation of Smiley, in concept very like Tom Farmer's Kwik-Fit, was to
make his fortune. He sold a third of the business to Continental in 1989
for #3.25m. He sold control three years later.
Since then, Fleming has invested in a range of small businesses, from
petrol stations to a cycle retailer. He took a stake in the refinanced
Geddes &amp; Grosset, a New Lanark book publisher, and began to talk
enthusiastically about opportunities in the book retailing trade.
Mr Fleming argued there was a gap in the market between the mainstream
retailers and the bargain basement outlets, offering a narrow range of
remaindered titles. With Tower Bookshops he wanted to challenge the
price-fixing that flows from the Net Book Agreement, but quickly ran
into problems with the Publishers Association.
Now the problems at Tower have overwhelmed him and may cost him the
house and gardens he first set his heart on when labouring, as a
teenager, on the Duke of Hamilton's estate on the other side of the
River Avon. The Flemings were not available for comment last night.

CROATIA went to war yesterday to crush a four-year rebellion by its
Serb minority.
A powerful offensive captured at least one large town in the Krajina
enclave and encircled the Serbs' mountain ''capital'', Knin. Croat
forces were closing in on Knin from all sides.
A Belgrade-based news agency reported that Knin was burning after a
steady artillery and missile onslaught. Its pro-Serb reporter on the
spot said: ''The destruction is heavy, houses are burning, streets are
full of glass and debris, many civilian facilities are hit.''
A huge plume of smoke hung over the citadel town, the stronghold of
Serb resistance to Croatian authority.
The Krajina news agency, again pro-Serb, said 2000 shells hit the Knin
area and ''a large number of civilians have been killed or wounded''.
At one point Nato warplanes flying in support of embattled
peacekeepers in the area fired two Harm missiles at a Croatian Serb
radar site after the planes were threatened with surface-to-air
missiles.
Reacting to events, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic took over
personal command of his army and designated his military commander,
General Ratko Mladic, as ''a co-ordinator'' between the armies of the
Bosnian Serbs and the Croat Serbs.
Karadzic said the need for a joint defence between Bosnian and
Croatian Serbs prompted the reshuffle of the army's chain of command.
It was not fully light when the Croatian army mobilised 100,000 troops
with tanks and air support to attack at 5am, in defiance of UN appeals
for restraint.
The offensive, within hours of the failure of talks between the two
sides in Geneva, was condemned by world governments concerned that the
fighting could inflame the whole of the Balkans.
However, fears that rump Yugoslavia might join the conflict eased when
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, although scornful of Croatia's
''aggressive posturing'', confined his response to an appeal for
international peace efforts.
Croatian government spokesmen said the army aimed to restore Zagreb's
rule in the entire Knin Krajina, a horseshoe of mountains and farming
valleys between Zagreb and the Adriatic.
They said the first day of the assault had gone well with the town of
Petrinja, south of Zagreb, falling to the army and Knin encircled.
The Croatians claimed they had ''knocked out'' 760 Serb soldiers and
captured five of their tanks.
Last night, a UN official in Knin, a symbol of resistance since
Croatia's Serbs seized a third of the country when it left Yugoslavia in
1991, said the town was shelled sporadically but remained calm.
US Defence Secretary William Perry gave limited support to the
offensive but Russia, Britain, France, and Germany demanded a halt to
fighting.
They urged negotiations on a late offer from the Krajina Serbs to
negotiate their re-integration with Croatia.
A Danish soldier was killed and two Polish troops were wounded by
deliberate Croatian tank fire on UN posts. The motive was to prevent
reporting of the military action.
The huge arsenal of Serb artillery and missiles in Krajina has kept
Croatian cities and the coastline under military threat and wrecked its
money-spinning Adriatic tourist industry.
Croatian strategy in the north appeared at first to be neutralising
the threat of rocket attacks on Zagreb's civilian population. The city
was untouched yesterday morning but Croatian officials reported a rocket
hit a Zagreb suburb late in the day.
Croat forces punched into Serb-held territory from Karlovac, south of
Zagreb, and advanced on Plaski to the south-west. Capturing Plaski would
enable them to try to relieve their Bosnian Muslim allies under Serb
siege in the Bihac pocket of north-west Bosnia.
That in turn would dash Serb hopes of opening a lifeline between the
Krajina and Bosnian Serb soil.

I WAS wearing my best linen suit, brown suede shoes, and a crisp white
shirt. My hair was combed, my cheeks were shaved. I was everything the
good-looking young hack should be. I was calling on a million dollars
and carrying a purple-potted geranium.
Annabel Giles isn't worth a million dollars. She just looks like she
is. In one day as a model for Estee Lauder make-up she earned #16,000.
Now I make that around #4,176,000 a year -- with weekends off. She did
offer to come back the next day, but they couldn't afford her. Too bad.
Today however she still has her own home, car, child -- eight-year-old
Molly -- and a career as a television presenter, co-hosting Monkhouse's
Memory Masters with Bob.
She also has Looking for Mr Giles, her debut Fringe show which cuts
close to the bone -- a censored celebrity confessional mixed with Blind
Date. In it Ms Giles hopes to find the man of her dreams each afternoon
among the audience of her one-woman show. Which brings me to the potted
plant. We're told to say it with flowers. My geranium said: ''Why wait
'til Edinburgh?''
As a couple we'd be chat-show gold. ''So Annabel, how did you meet the
new man in your life?''
''Well, actually, he was interviewing me for my new show. It's called
Looking for Mr Giles and it's on at the Pleasance Theatre in Edinburgh
from the August 16 to September 2.''
Our first date, ironically, was over polystyrene coffee cups at
Teddington television studios. I can tell she's moved by the plant, but
now it's time to talk.
It seems that Looking for Mr Giles offers audience participation,
personal confession, and the chance to pick a new partner. The audience
is given a form to fill in listing personal traits and fancies, and
while Annabel marks these, her disastrous love life unfolds through a
slide and voice-over show.
Annabel Giles -- woman of the world -- has experienced men in their
various guises such as:
Too Nice Guy: ''These are a certain type that are just too nice,
they're no use.''
Addict guy: ''Now addiction is an illness which spreads into other
areas. This is a very dangerous type of person, so self-obsessed that
they won't let you into their world.''
Older guy: ''These are usually nicer but the one I'm talking about was
a bit of a shit.''
Laddish guy: ''He doesn't want a girlfriend and we change character to
fit in with him. In the show I become a lad, I drink pints, dress like a
boy, and get so pissed I try to have a wee up against the wall.''
Omitted from the list was her favourite: The Famous Bastard. She won't
say whether Jeff Banks, Midge Ure, or Trainer star Mark Greenstreet fit
in this section: ''I never name names -- it's unfair.''
''I became attracted to one type, the famous bastard. But what you
realise is that the world is not filled with bastards, you just keep
choosing them. Nice people were never as interesting to me, I've had to
work at that.''
After we have analysed her love life, we get down to the match-making
part of her show. The winner faces his sternest test.
''They have to undergo a series of tests to see what sort of stuff
they are made of.''
''What test?''
''I can't possibly tell you . . . I can't.''
''Do they strip or what?''
''No! It's all nice things.''
''Tell me!''
''Oh all right. It's just humiliating, things like I hold up a
tea-towel and ask what it's for, or they have to read out a children's
story with all the voices . . . The rest I won't tell you.''
Should the candidate pass he'll walk away with Annabel clasped to his
chest in the form of a Polaroid picture. ''It says I Was Mr Giles For A
Day.''
From here we swiftly moved on to chucking, how to be dumped and
copewith being the one dumped on.
''The worst way I was ever chucked was on the answering machine of my
mobile phone -- 'I won't be able to see you tonight, in fact, I won't be
able to see you any-night ever again. . .' ''
Naughty, but still nicer than a younger Ms Giles who left her fiance,
graphic designer Brian Rutherford, standing at the altar, while her
parents explained to the 200 guests that their daughter had a previous
engagement with Midge Ure.
The former singer with Ultravox remains on good terms with his
ex-wife. (I didn't ask about Mr Rutherford.) But he will be unable to
attend the show. Instead, he'll be baby-sitting Molly during the
three-week run. ''We are very much friends today. The past is the
past.''
The show is a symbol of her recovery from a past which included
grinding through Prozac, self-help books, and group therapy classes.
It's less Looking for Mr Giles than finding Ms Giles.
If she plays to an empty room she'll be disappointed, not defeated.
''Margi Clark had a rough time but she never looked back, she just
pushed on.'' Anyway, it will be another step to distance her from the
depressive who could hardly raise herself from a chair.
Freud would have a field-day on the convent schoolgirl turned model
whose future lies inside such a confessional. But at least today she has
fought her demons and is out looking for love . . . even if it's not
with me. I did get a lift back and she loved the potted plant. She said
it went with her show.

ORDINARILY, Still/Here would have arrived at the Edinburgh Festival
with a suitable flourish of highly favourable reviews and bright
features about choreographer Bill T Jones and the truly moving
background to the piece.
But something extraordinary overtook Jones and this particular work at
the end of last year. That something was a calculatedly contentious
piece in the festive double issue of the New Yorker. Penned by the
magazine's dance critic Arlene Croce -- one of the most powerful and
long-established voices on the scene -- it lammed into the subject
matter of Still/Here, vilifying it as a piece of ''victim art''.
Croce, it transpired, had not seen the piece. Nor, as she made
vehemently clear, did she intend to. It was, in her estimation,
unreviewable: ''I can't review someone I feel sorry for or hopeless
about.'' A brave friend might have told her she wasn't being called upon
to do any such thing. For although the piece involves videotaped
testimony from people confronting terminal illnesses, no-one on stage is
terminally ill -- unless you count living itself as a conveyor belt to
death.
In effect, what Croce did was discriminate in terms of what was
acceptable as art and what was not. ''Dissed blacks, abused women, and
disenfranchised homosexuals'' could, it seemed, go through all manner of
hell on earth so long as they didn't parade their experiences, or their
suffering, before others in the guise of art -- because that would be
emotional blackmail, an exploitation of audience sensibilities . . .
The ensuing brouhaha was immediateand far-reaching. Back in February,
alarm bells tinkled in certain quarters of Edinburgh's district council.
The authority that permits topless go-go dancers in city-centre bars and
licenses saunas with (nudge 'n' wink) optional extras was seriously
concerned that ''victim art'' was on its way to the Festival . . .
Bill T Jones has had months now of Croce's diatribe clinging -- like a
leech -- on to the touring schedule of Still/Here.
Journalists all over Europe have asked for his responses to her litany
of jibes and -- when we met in Amsterdam -- I was no exception. His
answer came in instalments. Rather than mouth off in a counterblast of
vitriol, he astutely used her, and her agenda, to reinforce his own.
Not that he isn't angry and offended by Croce's pointed attacks. ''On
a human level, I'm deeply offended. On an artist level, I am learning
like mad. Because this is how history is written, how history is
changed. And that was what Arlene's article was about -- just who is
writing history. And I said -- 'I'll be damned! I'm writing it along
with you, lady. No -- you don't control this discourse.''
Jones's reaction, his refusal to be marginalised or edited out of
whatever passes for the record of our times, stems from his experiences
as a black gay man now HIV positive, albeit asymptomatic. From childhood
-- his parents were poor, migrant field-workers -- Jones (now 42)
witnessed first-hand the easy bigotry that doesn't bother to beat up or
burn out those it hates. It simply pretends they don't exist.
His skin colour, his sexuality, his sero-positive status have all
informed his choreography, as has the enduring grief occasioned by the
death, from Aids, of his partner Arnie Zane in 1988. In piece after
piece, Jones's anger and sense of passionate outrage have forced issues
of discrimination centre stage. He has celebrated and mourned Arnie and
he has blazed out against racism and the genial passivity which advances
it by doing nothing to stop it.
He has made utterly beguiling, eye-catching dance carry tough,
confrontational questions about life, relationships, art, sexuality, and
politics. And he has echoed those questions on stage in fierce,
uncompromising speech that -- like his dance -- has a shapeliness in its
emphatic syntax, its selected vocabulary and rhythms. Nor has he shied
away from being controversial, if the need arose. Still/Here, however,
was not made -- or meant to be controversial. Enter Arlene Croce, once
again, into the conversation.
Jones attributes her punitive onslaught to the critic's worst
nightmare -- being ignored. He isn't joking. ''From her self-imposed
exile, she had declared that almost everything happening wasn't worth
seeing. Suddenly, there's this moving, chugging along. People are
interested it, people are going to see it. 'Hold on -- this is not
possible without my approving it!' . . . She's a very great mind, but a
very fragile ego. Why is the discourse all about me? Why don't we ever
talk about the fragile egos of writers?''
My ego prepares to wilt under close scrutiny but in truth there are
more interesting things to discuss. The preparation for and intent of
Still/Here, for instance.
Arnie's death and Jones's own diagnosis as sero-positive had brought a
new awareness of mortality into his life. Still/Here came about because,
as Jones says: ''The truth is no-one gets out of here alive. So is this
me wagging a stick at you, trying to threaten you? No. It's saying that
we're all scared shitless about this, and we don't have to be so afraid.
So we go to people who have had it thrust upon them, have accepted it
gracefully, and we listen.''
The listening and the watching -- and the video recording used in
performance -- were all done across 18 months at a series of Survival
Workshops held in different parts of America. People of all ages who had
confronted terminal illness -- cancers, leukemia, multiple sclerosis,
and, yes, Aids -- explored, with Jones, signal moments in their
experiencing of illness. It is their testimony, their insights and
strategies, that formed the bedrock of a work that is most assuredly
life-affirming.
For Jones this was his answer to incipient self-pity. ''I did not want
to be a victim. I wanted to understand calamity and death as something
that happens to people because we are alive.'' His voice, as he names
individuals from those workshops and recalls their significant phrase or
gesture, has a gentle fierceness to it. These people -- some, maybe as
many as a third, no longer living -- gave freely of their innermost
being so that Still/Here could speak with an honest voice.
The art here lies in the projection -- through marvellously melded
video, music, and movement -- of a resolute vitality. Of each breath
valued because it wasn't the last. There are courage and grace here,
anger and irony, an unexpected joy and a fighting spirit that is
profoundly humbling. There is only one victim in all of this -- the
sadly out-of-touch Arlene Croce.
* Still/Here can be seen at the Playhouse on August 25, 26, and 27.

THE PRINCE formerly known as Hamlet had his answering machine on. This
is what he was saying: ''Hello it's me. What is this quintessence of
dust?'' Not having a ready answer, the caller is disinclined to leave a
message, suspecting that the artist still known as Arthur Smith is
lurking somewhere in the background. At any rate he is doing one of a
record seven Hamlet and Hamlet-related shows on this year's Edinburgh
Festival Fringe.
There is little certainty as to what Arthur Smith plans to do in his
re-writing of the play hitherto known as Hamlet, least of all from
Arthur himself. One theory is that he will size up some of the six
opposition productions to assess their tactics before naming a line-up
or committing himself to a plot for his run from August 20 at The
Pleasance. Only one closely guarded secret has leaked out. Arthur seems
to be toying with the idea of having the Prince of Denmark murdered as
quickly as possible in his reading of the play, which should speed up
the action a bit.
Arthur is reticent. In fact, he is just not answering his phone, but
his message on the machine may indicate that he is at least learning
some lines. ''A profound meditation on the nature of depression,
despair, and revenge, with a couple of laughs thrown in,'' is as much as
he will reveal at this stage. ''I adopt a cubist approach to the text
and the result is annoyingly pretentious but not very long.''
The only other thing we can get out of him is that there won't be an
interval. ''But there will be a bit of nudity,'' he adds hastily. ''A
stand-up Hamlet,'' ventures his publicist. ''Everyone wants to play
Hamlet. But the RSC wouldn't let Arthur audition for it. We think that's
probably why he's doing it.''
George Dillon has had a little longer, one suspects, to prepare his
Hamlet for his run from August 11 at Assembly Rooms. He says he has had
it running over in his mind for the last 10 years, and if this reflects
his getting stuck in the emotional life of an adolescent he makes no
apology. His Hamlet will be an action man, a swordsman trained in the
dangers of spending too long thinking before he strikes. Hard luck,
Polonius.
Apart from getting ''To be or not to be'' out of the way early as a
prologue, Dillon is sticking more or less to the play that Shakespeare
wrote, reducing it to 100 minutes but keeping something recognisable of
the original shape, presumably. ''It is not a conceptual approach,'' he
insists. ''I'm convinced that Shakespeare would have cut it today, and
the different folio editions reveal that he was already in process of
cutting it back then.''
Take this to a logical conclusion, of course, and you have the bits of
Hamlet that survive in a couple of minutes of the hugely popular Reduced
Shakespeare Company, who are giving a couple of performances of The
Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) at the Edinburgh
Festival Theatre, August 7 and 8. If that sounds a little too drastic,
there is Malachi Bogdanov's treatment of Hamlet as the 35-minute
centrepiece of Sawn-Off Shakespeare, presented by the highly rated
Torsion Theatre from August 13 at Adam House Theatre. It is Hamlet
stripped to a naked storyline in a programme which has an irreverant
Romeo And Juliet, red noses and rag dolls, and a grotesque 20-minute
Macbeth which was much admired last year.
''If Shakespeare saw our Hamlet in 30 minutes he would want to
plagiarise himself,'' boasts Malachi Bogdanov, who has reduced the rest
of the cast to a chorus of four who weave in and out of the action.
This is still not as radical as John Cargill Thompson's treatment in
his Hamlet II: Prince of Jutland, with actor Rik Forrest, which returns
to Shakespeare's sources to correct more than a few historical
inaccuracies. Thus we discover that Old Hamlet was never the father of
Young Hamlet, but his brother, and his name was Horvendile. Hamlet's dad
was Feng, the character Shakespeare presented as Claudius. Gertrude was
Geruta, Ophelia was Hilda, and so it continues through to Hermuthruda,
''an almost virgin queen of the Picts, Hamlet's girlfriend''. It gets
complicated when Hamlet's wife, the beautiful Orwenna, is revealed. So,
we are in for a thorough revision.
Cargill Thompson's piece is a monologue, as many of his works for
theatre have been, often written for specific actor friends on the
unusual commission of a couple of rugby jerseys. As the playwright's
sporting collection has grown, so have performances of his work
increased on the Fringe, and he is second only to Shakespeare this year
with 11 shows, although the living writer is quick to point out that
more of his plays are being performed than among the 24 versions of the
Bard. Just how he counts Romeo And Juliet: Happily Never After (His?
Shakespeare's? A collaboration?) is open to debate, but it is another
departure, and part of the Cargill Thompson programme running from
August 9 at The Cafe Royal presented by Manchester-based 'Our Theatre
Company. The 'Our is temporal rather than possessive. Each of the plays
runs around 60 minutes.
For a conventional Hamlet, which may be regarded as an odd way to
describe one that will be delivered in American accents, you have to go
for Shenandoah Shakespeare Express's two-hour 15-minute version, which
represents a fast-paced 90% of Shakespeare's first quarto version for a
cast of 11. The Harrisonburg, Virginia-based company spend most of the
year on the road and they are bringing Hamlet back-to-back with Tom
Stoppard's companion piece Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead, from
August 15 at Adam House Theatre. Also in the repertoire there are the
company's offerings of The Tempest and Twelfth Night. ''Traditional but
never dull,'' says Paul Menzer of the company.
Finally, if you want an ''uncluttered'' Hamlet in impeccable received
pronunciation accents you might bet on Oxford University's Double Edge
Drama to do the business. Theirs is a two-hour version for a cast of
eight. ''Sparse. No self-indulgence, an action production,'' says Justin
Nolan of the show that will run at Greyfriars Kirkhouse from August 28.
That is just the story with Hamlet. Among this year's Macbeths you can
have versions in Japanese, Scots, and even in the English that
Shakespeare wrote. There was a Bulgarian musical version, but it has
dropped out, a sad loss for collectors. There is a recommendable piece
of nonsense, Lady Macbeth Firmed My Buttocks from Reservoir Kittens at
Marco's from August 11, which may produce the first fusion between
Shakespeare and step-aerobics. Maybe this finally explains why the Bard
is going on stronger than ever this year.

DON HALL is almost certainly the only Edinburgh Fringe performer ever
to have had a gangland executioner's contract taken out on his life.
Moreover, he likes to suck on bottles of beer while simultaneously
eating barbecued bratwurst and smoking a cigar. And talking. Non-stop.
Loud.
Don Hall is Chicago personified . . . he is the ugly American. Who
says so? Why, Don Hall, of course. Listen to him. When you're in his
mesmeric presence, you have no choice.
''Let's face it . . . I'm portly. I talk too fast. I sweat a lot. I
wear a baseball cap and flame-grill the flesh of dead animals in my
backyard. All I lack for the complete picture of an all-American redneck
is a handgun in my belt. And a porno mag peeking out of my pants pocket,
heh heh heh . . . ''
Given this information, you'll not be surprised to learn that Don's
idea of theatre is a similarly gritty one. ''What I hate is theatre
that's hand-fed pabulum . . . What I'm aiming for is theatre that leads
you into heated all-night discussions with your friends once the show is
over.''
But what are Don Hall's two shows? Armageddon Radio Hour and
ComedySportz. The former will be performed by the 13 members of Don's
Level 6 company, nine of whom will be doubling up in ComedySportz. Don
describes the latter as ''the Burger King of comedy improv''.
''Hand over $5000; do an audition for ComedySportz's founder; find a
venue; establish your roster of performers -- and end up running a
ComedySportz show. It's a franchised format for a comedy club. There's
now a national chain of them operating in 22 cities in the US.''
ComedySportz can best be described as the pacey live blueprint for
Clive Anderson's Whose Line Is It Anyway. Franchisees are given a handy
instruction book telling them how to MC a sports-themed evening of
improv games between two teams.
''Level 6 is very different company,'' says Don. ''Armageddon Radio
Hour is our vanity project. It's a well-researched parody of a live
forties radio broadcast that's as complicated, bizarre, and unusual as
we can make it. Like Walter Winchell on LSD.''
Despite Don's willingness to play up his untutored persona, he is
actually well-versed in conventional dramatic craft, having spent his
teens in a Shakespearian repertory company. Acting's lure had palled by
the time Don came to consider college, however, and he opted to study
jazz.
A professional jazzer's nighthawk lifestyle proved incompatible with
marriage, and Don next became a music teacher in Chicago's ailing
public-school system. Don resigned last month after seven hard years at
the chalkface. ''It's like being in the peace corps. Via my pupils I was
confronted by drugs, by 13-year-old gang-members carrying guns . . .''
Guns! Gangs! Who wanted you dead, Don?
''The Latin Kings put a contract out on me. I used to scare gang
members in class. What most upset the gangs was me walking some of my
kids home if they asked me to because gangs initiate new members by 15
of them beating one kid up in the street until he joins.
''So one day some 43-year-old Hispanic gang-leader puts the word out
from his jail cell. The police came round and said I should leave town
as I was the subject of a K-O-S, Kill On Sight. I didn't leave town. I
figured that if they were going to try and shoot me, they'd be sure to
miss -- hell, drive-bys always end with innocent bystanders dead in the
gutter.''
OK, so being mown down in the street isn't your aim. What is your
ultimate ambition?
''It's not to make money or be famous. I want respect and notoriety.
And where Second City has the Ted Liss tribute wall, a collection of
ceramic hand-prints in memory of one of their teachers, I want the Don
Hall tribute wall of ceramic butt-prints.''
* The Armageddon Radio Hour and ComedySportz will both be staged
nightly at Moray House, the former at 6.15pm and the latter at 11.10pm.

ALTHOUGH it's inevitable that Shirley Anderson turns out to be a
graduate of Chicago's Second City school of improvised comedy theatre,
there's something less than predictable about Shirley's attitude to the
form.
''I love improv as a training tool, but not as an end in itself,'' she
says in plain defiance of the prevailing trend in the city towards
moist-eyed reverence for all things of an improvised nature.
Underlining her viewpoint, Shirley's one-woman Edinburgh Fringe show,
Big Blonde, adheres firmly to the text of the autobiographical novella
by Dorothy Parker which inspired it. Yet like thousands of other
aspiring American actors, Shirley Anderson was drawn to Chicago by
Second City's nationwide reputation for excellence. So why is she not an
improv disciple?
It's a simple question which requires California-born Shirley's
life-story as its answer. Having grown up next door to the CIA's Langley
HQ in Virginia, Shirley initially studied drama at Boston University.
Acting was what she always wanted to do.
''I remember at the age of five sitting on a stool, training a
flashlight on myself, trying to be Mae West. So I suppose you could say
that there's always been this latent urge in me to be a big blonde lush,
just like Hazel Morse in Big Blonde.''
Shirley's desire to be an actor had been further strengthened when, at
the age of 15, she was sent to a summer camp in the Catskills. There she
found herself spellbound by a charismatic drama tutor. ''He was a small,
fiery, chain-smoking bisexual Cuban director who threw chairs at people
who didn't appear to be listening to him.''
Unfortunately, after three years at Boston, the drama department
lobbed Shirely a bombshell: a letter telling her that her skills weren't
up to continuing the course. She moped for six months before getting
back on track at Northwestern University, near Chicago.
Further training at Second City was thus a convenient and logical
progression, if not a simple one. ''Back then everyone was acutely aware
of Second City having become the traditional stepping stone to Saturday
Night Live, and the whole focus seemed to be about writing snappy
one-liners. In contrast, I've always been much more about characters.''
And Chicago is a tough arena for actors who choose to sell the
characters they play as opposed to continually selling themselves.
''The competition in Chicago is incredible. There's always a new
company, a new one-person show. Chicago theatre is commercially minded,
too, with an attitude that's typically Chicago: 'Create your own work,
get on with business.'
''I don't want to appear bitter and say: 'Oh, it's because I'm a woman
that I'm not getting enough work' because there are some women who are
doing fine. There are women who fit the limited acting categories open
to women and who do OK, and I don't. Casting directors want to be able
to conceive of you in an easy-to-categorise phrase . . . and I'm not the
wide-eyed ingenue; I'm not the cosy mom.
''No-one has ever really known what to do with me. That's what made me
do my own show . . . my show is my own audition. I worry, too, that
unlike me, some wildly successful actors never consciously decided to be
actors. Maybe I'll grow into something by the time I get to 40.
''I keep working, I keep writing. If you sit around waiting for calls,
you'll sit waiting forever. It's a test of your desire as an actor, if
nothing else.
''But I had made such plans for myself at the age of 10. I used to
know exactly what I wanted by the age of 30. Kids; glamour; to be a
leading lady . . . but then a lot happens from 10 to 30. You grow up, I
guess. I haven't got the Oscar I thought I'd have by now, but at least
I've grown more sure that the stage, not film, is where I want to be
anyway.''
Critics who've seen Shirley Anderson on stage in Big Blonde, the story
of a desperate-to-please twenties flapper, agree that they've been
privileged to see her there. Her performance has inspired a torrent of
deserved superlatives. It has been hailed as a perceptive and poignant
tour de force with a remarkable feat of actorly transformation at its
core. For while Hazel Morse is big, blowzy and florid, Shirley
Anderson's everyday mien is one of elfin petiteness.
Good write-ups won't cause her to develop an inflated opinion of her
own worth, however. After all, acting hasn't yet managed to provide her
with a day-to-day living -- aside from the occasional TV ad, she works
full-time as a legal secretary -- and she is approaching Edinburgh with
realistic expectations.
''What I'm most hoping for in Edinburgh is to see new work, new forms.
To generate new ideas. If you can't do that at what we're told is the
biggest arts festival in the world, where can you?''
Unlike the majority of the performers coming over to the Fringe from
Chicago, she has previous Edinburgh experience behind her. ''I came over
in 1988 to be in the American Festival Theatre's production of Our Town.
I wish I'd seen more theatre at the time. I wish I hadn't tried to quit
smoking . . . Edinburgh is not a good time to try that.''
Shirley Anderson: she's no quitter. Moreover, in Big Blonde she's
quite addictive.
* Big Blonde is nightly at 5.40pm Hill Street Theatre throughout the
Fringe.

IN THE toddling town that's happy to be known as City of Big
Shoulders, they'll readily tell you that they invented skyscrapers,
department stores, and the deep-dish pizza. Chicago: shouldering a busy,
no-nonsense path through life. Residents of America's third largest city
are also likely to express a quiet pride in being home to the world's
most sky-scraping skyscraper, the Sears Tower, as well as an
eight-storey shopping mall that is second only to the Pentagon in the
acreage of its floor-space.
Additionally, the more obsessive Chicagoan might be able to tell you
that the city's wide seasonal range of temperatures has resulted in its
cornering one-third of all the world's revolving doors, all the better
to exclude winter's icy blasts and yet retain an air-conditioned cool
during Chicago's summer-time furnace. Chicago: the inland metropolis
with its own sea, Lake Michigan, which provides 20-odd miles of golden
beach close to the city's centre.
Rather more to the point, Chicago is currently home to a ton of
accomplished and influential cultural endeavour. For instance, Chicago's
Afro-American ghettos spawned house, the sound which has propelled
dance-floors around the globe for the past decade. At a different end of
the spectrum, if you open the packed arts sections of either of
Chicago's two daily newspapers, you'll generally find two whole pages
devoted solely to that week's forthcoming literary events:
book-readings, poetry seminars, and in-store addresses by authors.
But if it's theatre you want, Chicago is the place. Informed estimates
put the number of theatres at 150 -- from formal venues to one-person
shows in people's living-rooms. There has also been the emergence of
Steppenwolf's in-your-face, risk-taking brand of physical drama, a form
which acted as a launch-pad for the career of John Malkovich.
And it has been in Chicago that a particular type of theatrical comedy
has evolved: improvisational, quick-witted, funny, and clever without
being clever-clever. It is this vital strand of theatre with which the
Chicago Performance Mafia will shortly be enlivening the Edinburgh
Festival Fringe.
Ten companies have grouped together under the Chicago Performance
Mafia banner, with Second City chief among them. While Second City's
name might be relatively unknown in Britain, the company having made
only one other foray to these shores, to Mayfest in 1991, the names of
Second City's thespian alumni are among the most well-kent in the world.
As Second City celebrates its 35th year, it can look back with pride
on having trained virtually everyone who's ever been anyone in modern
film comedy-drama, whether for TV or Hollywood. There was the
Ghostbusters team of Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, and Dan Aykroyd. In the
cast of Cheers there's been Shelley Long and George Wendt. On the silver
screen there's been John Candy, John and Jim Belushi, as well as Alan
Arkin, Alan Alda, and Mike Myers. Acidic talk-show hostess Joan Rivers
was a Second City graduate, as was Ryan Stiles, of Whose Line Is It
Anyway . . . the Second City roll-call goes on forever.
In addition, Second City has long been the major provider of satirical
talent to America's top topical comedy TV show, Saturday Night Live.
This fact was foremost in the minds of Anne Libera and Kelly Leonard,
respectively director and producer of Second City's Fringe-bound show, a
greatest-skits compilation entitled From The Second City, when we met
last month in Chicago.
Why? Because Saturday Night Live, keen to restore its currently ailing
reputation, is at the moment considering whether to snap up eight
present Second City performers, including three of the quintet who are
due to begin their run in Auld Reekie in a week's time. Second City's
overseers are sanguine about the possible overnight exodus of personnel.
It is something for which they are always prepared.
''The minute an actor is ready, he goes,'' says Kelly Leonard.
''Second City is Comedy University for young actors. We understand that
they are going to be seen by other organisations, and that they're going
to be offered chances which it will be impossible to ignore.''
Not that Second City will have any difficulty in finding Edinburgh
stand-ins should they be needed. As well as its long-established
twin-stage Chicago theatre with a complement of 60 actors, Second City
has two other theatres, in Detroit and Toronto, each with their own
resident company. Moreover, there are three touring companies, plus an
exceptionally-busy Chicago training centre with a through-flow of 1000
students per year, hopeful comedy actors being attracted to it from all
over America.
How does Second City handle its own acting staff? ''On a basic level,
they learn what will work with an audience and what won't,'' says Kelly
Leonard. ''They learn how to hone their jokes.'' More importantly,
Second City undergraduates learn how not to force jokes; how not to be
continually in pursuit of laughter; how not to impose themselves on the
group of actors with whom they are intended to be sharing a stage.
This whole philosophy is set out in Truth In Comedy, a book jointly
written by one of Second City's founders, Del Close, along with director
and lecturer Charna Halpern, and journalist Kim Johnson.
''One of the founding tenets of improv is the point of
concentration,'' says Anne Libera. ''What this means is that if you're
busy on stage doing something, then you will neither worry about being
looked at, nor what you're saying. The idea is to distract one half of
your brain, the half consciously concerned with the mundane, in order to
allow the creative half of your brain to work.''
Charna Halpern's beliefs are echoed with messianic zeal by the current
crop of performers who comprise ImprovOlympic, the theatre company of
which Ms Halpern has been director for the past 12 years. Due to appear
in Edinburgh under the more self-explanatory title of the Chicago Improv
Syndicate, the ImprovOlympians view the acting guidelines set out in
Truth In Comedy as valid advice for the living of everyday life, no
less.
''This might make us sound a little Branch Davidian, like some
religious sect,'' admits ImprovOlympic director Kevin Mullaney, ''but
it's how we view the way we work as a group on stage. We feel that if
it's to work in a way that's satisfying for everyone, improvisation
depends upon you not listening to yourself, to your own voice. You have
to listen to everyone else. You have to give yourself up for others.''
This philosophy applies especially to the long-form improvisations in
which ImprovOlympic typically immerse themselves for around half an hour
to 40 minutes a time.
''In improvisation, you have to be truthful about what's actually
happening on stage at that moment, so you end up with a greater realism
. . . An audience should get the feeling that they're listening to an
argument or a conversation between a couple who know one another really
well . . . it's like the appeal of eavesdropping: you know you
shouldn't, but there's an exposure of intimacy that's compelling.''
Part of Second City's enduring success has been its willingness to
listen to its audiences and to its critics. In so doing, the company has
been able to work out more clearly what it is and at whom it is aimed.
''We attract movie audiences, not just regular theatre-goers, which is
obviously heartening,'' says Kelly Leonard, ''although it is very
painful to hear the occasional person on the way out saying things like:
'Yeah, that was OK, but I don't like to have to think about things.'
''There's an old criticism of Second City: 'White guys in neck-ties.'
While we've always had lots of female performers, the late Gilda Radner
having been one of the most notable, we have begun an outreach programme
in Chicago's south side to address a racial imbalance.
''Via the press, we have come to see that there are two other common
misconceptions about Second City. The first is that every evening at
Second City will be filled with uproarious laughter. The second is that
we are intensely intellectual and satirical, and very moving as well.
''We're sure enough about ourselves to be able to say that we're all
these things . . . but not necessarily all at once, every evening.''
See for yourself when Second City grace the Edinburgh Fringe.

ONE theatre company operates in what had hitherto been, rather
dubiously, a Swedish-American men's bath-house club. The other is
located in a former plumbing supplies warehouse. These converted venues,
respectively occupied by ImprovOlympic and Annoyance Theatre, are a
gauge of the vital muscularity of drama today in post-industrial
Chicago. Improvised comedy in the nineties: it cannot be contained in
regular theatrical premises.
ImprovOlympic, or the Chicago Improv Syndicate as they have re-named
themselves for the Fringe, are approaching their trip to Edinburgh with
missionary fervour. ''We want to show how far improv can go; how in
Chicago it has become an art-form in its own right . . . how it can be a
whole, unified theatrical experience,'' says director Kevin Mullaney.
Crucial to this process is long-form improv's flagship: the Harold.
The whit?
Codified and fostered by Second City co-founder Del Close, the Harold
is a silly name for a serious acting process, an improv game based on
adaptation. The name actually echoes George Harrison's offhand reply to
a reporter's inquiry, at the height of Beatlemania, about whether the
Merseyside Moptops had a name for their haircut. ''Albert,'' was
George's deadpan reply. Hence ''Harold'' -- later amended to the Harold
-- when Del Close was faced with a similar question.
''It's a means to have a lot of people on stage at once with a common
goal,'' says Kevin Mullaney. ''We take a suggestion from the audience.
We break it down verbally. We free-associate. We support each other's
ideas through the creation of a group-mind, and thus the group becomes
smarter than its individual components.
''Our ensemble name is Frank Booth, and when we get together to be
Frank Booth properly, Frank is a great deal funnier than any of us. On
those nights we go up to one another later and say things like: 'Harold
was on stage with us' or 'Yup, I saw Harold sitting at the bar
tonight'.''
In contrast, when Eric Hoffman and Mike Monterastelli bluster their
way through Idiotic Death of Two Fools, the show they co-wrote for
Annoyance Theatre, it's easy to be put in mind of Rik Mayall and Ade
Edmondson sitting at a bar. The show is a loose-leafed grunge-era take
on Beckettian themes of alienation, boredom, and powerlessness.
''A lot of two-man shows are revues, wacky characters creating
scenes,'' the show's director, Gary Ruderman, says defensively. ''Our
goal with this play was to create a framework in which we can explore
characters without the worry of a plot taking you from A to B.
''So it's not a Godot parody, it's more a tenth dimension where weird
stuff happens out of nowhere, where dialogues lead you into monologues
that spin off at tangents . . . where the unexpected can happen.''
ImprovOlympic's unique selling-line is that their theatre's seats,
which were picked up when the Chicago Bulls' baseball team redeveloped
their old stadium, used to cost baseball fans $1500 a season -- ''but
now each one's yours for only $3.70 a night''. Annoyance Theatre adopt a
more oblique line. At the back of their performance space is a wall
bearing a graffiti-ist's confrontational spray-painted tag: Theatre
Sucks.
See either show and you'll become convinced of both claims: you'll
have obtained a bargain and you'll have become aware that more
conventional theatrical forms are somewhat lacking.
* Annoyance Theatre's Idiotic Death of Two Fools will be staged
nightly at Over-Seas House in Princes Street at 9.0pm; Chicago Improv
Syndicate's Harold on the Holyrood is nightly at 9.50pm in Moray House.

A Place with the Pigs, Communicado, Traverse Theatre: I always see
something at the Traverse and something at Theatre Workshop. I didn't
see Communicado last year because I don't like being too predictable,
but I saw them when they did Cyrano de Bergerac and that was brilliant,
so I'm glad that they're back again so I can see them without seeming
predictable.
The Tartan Amoebas, the Fringe Club and Marco's: This is a group I

very eclectic musically and have some very good bass-playing.
Trainspotting, Citizens' Theatre, Assembly Rooms: I haven't read the

you read something and then see an adaptation, so I might see this and

LAST year, one of the unexpected gems thrown up by the Fringe was a
solo dance-theatre piece called Circuit Breaker, choreographed, spoken,
and performed by Sian Williams. In it, Williams in a bravura display of
dance and vocal athleticism, hung upside down on a trapeze in a ring of
sawdust telling a desperate story of love, loss, and dependency -- a
love affair that went wrong.
The words were by poet Judith Williamson, the music by long-time
collaborator Howard Davidson, and though it arrived late, unheralded,
and unnannounced -- too late even to put it into the Fringe brochure --
those packed into the Gilded Balloon knew they were seeing something
special.
''It came,'' says director Michael Merwitzer, ''just at the right
time.'' As co-founder and co-artistic director with Williams of the
dance-theatre group The Kosh, together they had built up the company
over 12 years with the support of an Arts Council of England grant of
almost #750,000. Suddenly last year the council's dance panel cut their
grant completely leaving Merwitzer without a company and debts totalling
#50,000.
Choosing his words carefully, Merwitzer will only say that the
council's conduct has now become the subject of an official statement of
complaint served on the council by the Parliamentary Ombudsman.
So, it was while the trials and tribulations of last year were at
their height that a friend suddenly suggested that Circuit Breaker which
Williams had been working on informally might make a perfect piece for
Edinburgh. ''It was just what we needed,'' says Merwitzer, ''something
creative and positive to take our minds away from the other horrors.''
Without publicity or fanfare it became a hit thanks to word of mouth.
Hardly surprising. For Williams is one of those rare performers -- a
dancer of extraordinary physical dynamism and control with the capacity
to deliver text and make sense of what she is speaking under conditions
that would make most of us pant for breath -- never mind speak lines as
well. Her stamina is phenomenal -- after delivering a sweat-drenching
two-hour public performance her way of relaxing is to dance up a storm
in private for another two hours.
The good news is that Circuit Breaker and Williams are returning again
this year with an additional, and even more demanding, piece, Upstart
(again with words by Judith Williamson) -- under the general title of
Just Below the Surface.
Based on the Flamenco farruca dance, and set to a pounding soundtrack
by young club musicians Fuel (Jamie Hancock and Nick Merovich) that
mixes traditional flamenco rhythms with sampling and hip-hop, Williams
in a figure-clinging wet-rubber suit (designed by Yvonne Deacon) is a
knock-out.
Williams says: ''I wanted her to look very 'now', very 'out there' --
a cartoon character, like Tank Girl. The rubber represents lots of
things to with sub-cultures. I love the way fashion and stuff on the
street finally filters through and gets accepted into the mainstream.
''I wanted her to have a kind of untouchable quality.''
''Yes,'' says Merwitzer, anticipating the criticisms of using rubber
for 'kinky' reasons, ''she's an independent spirit, a very established
kind of person -- and unlike the woman of the first piece, not at the
mercy of love. The rubber clearly shows the female form but it's like a
second skin'' -- a fact which intriguingly creates a sense both of
intense femaleness but also an equally haunting quality of androgyny.
Williams talks warmly of theatre in India which they visited last year
courtesy of the British Council (who have also invited them to tour
later this year to South America and Brazil) and of the natural
acceptance there of ''this notion of male and female in everybody''. ''I
love that ambiguity,'' says Merwitzer.
''As you grow older, the more you can see the dissonance between what
we say with words and what our bodies say -- often two entirely
things.''
That fusion of the verbal with the physical, of traditional and
modern, seen and unseen, inner and outer is what for many people has
made the Kosh's work in the past few years so exciting -- and unique.
Extending the bounds of dance theatre, making a bridge between dance
and popular theatre, and giving passionate voice to things that can't
always be explained but touch the imagination -- and the senses -- this
is what Kosh at their best do superlatively well.
And this is unquestionably Kosh at their best. Whatever the Arts
Council's current view of the company, this double-bill -- and Williams
-- are a sensation. If you don't come out wanting to dance all night
long, I'll eat my hat.
* Just Below The Surface is at The Gilded Balloon from August 13 to
September 2.

BETTER than any of the selections you will inevitably waste time,
money, and sheer energy on to get yourself into that uncomfortable seat
in a remote and dingy hall to suffer the familiar disappointments,
embarrassments, and apoplectic disbelief of yet another bummer of a
Fringe show. You can afford to smile at its false promises.
Better, too, than those times in the final week when you will sit over
a bottle of wine with a fellow victim of the Fringe-fix, and compare the
war wounds of all the shows you have seen between the pair of you, the
heroic campaigns when you survived seven or eight in a day, and the
nights when you reeled from the one that is always going down to the
next that is always going up. You accept it will make a mercenary of
you.
Better even than those transcendental moments when you actually find
something good enough to recommend, when you ''discover'' your own gem
and the national reviewers haul themselves round to it at least a week
later with their portentous plaudits and awards. You can anticipate its
rewards.
Best is when you first solicit all of these experiences, the good, the
bad, and the dangerous in the Fringe programme. You still have your
strength and your sanity. Your nerve ends are in that unsuspecting
repose in the tranquil days before it all begins with what the Fringe
fatefully calls Week Zero. This is when you are just browsing through
your Fringe programme, making your preliminary choices, marking out the
shows that hold some hint of promise, calling upon your instinct and
experience, recognising the names of old friends and favourites among
the performers, and making wry notes of musts to avoid.
Just you and the programme in your hands. The calm before the storm.
This is the best of the Fringe.
Yet even at this stage, the planning stage from a safe remove, there
are pitfalls. Out there, come August 11 and during the succeeding four
weeks when you will lose the capacity to make any kind of rational
decision, are 13,378 separate performances of 1237 shows in 174
performance spaces.
It is the biggest show on earth. Before you surrender to the
zombie-like trance that will have you following any queue of punters
into the nearest show to hand, you must try to compile some kind of
list. Here are some tips on how to spot the ones to avoid.
Each company has 40 words to sell themselves in the programme.
Scrutinise each word carefully, suspiciously. A global computer network
version of the programme and screened video adverts by performers at
city-wide terminals are the Fringe's latest innovations, but until these
gain greater currency you must treat each of these 40-word programme
entries as the rope by which they will either hang or hoist themselves
to your attention.
Article One of the Fringe Survivor's Code is to avoid anyone who has
to tell you that they are funny. If they have to tell you, they are not.
You can multiply this rule by the number of adjectives used to assure
you of how funny they are. Slatteries Not Included are ''genuinely
funny'', which is the nearest anyone comes to saying all the rest of the
funnies are crap.
Worst are the ''brilliantly funny'' shows, of which you can
immediately eliminate Bulgakov's Moliere by the Oxmad Theatre Company
among quite a few others, but supreme offenders are The Comedy Zone with
Julian Barratt, Tony Burgess, Dave Gorman &amp; Wara who manage both a
''brilliantly funny'' and a ''very funny'' in the same 40-word entry.
This is a poor effort. ''Very funny'' is itself a sad little testimonial
to attribute to yourself, even if you have lifted it from the one review
you got last year from the Galway Advertiser.
More sad is ''very, very funny'', which earns an immediate red card
for An Evening With Roberto Baggio, but there is a terrifying array of
other funnies.
My survey should alert you to the guaranteed mirthlessness of
''outrageously funny'', ''unbelievably funny'', ''sharply funny'',
''devastatingly funny'', ''painfully funny'' and, that culpable offence
among funnies, ''wickedly funny''.
They are all included in this year's programme, in baleful droves.
Alarming is the creeping incidence of the less familiar but equally
disheartening ''triumphantly funny'', ''screamingly funny'' and
''captivatingly funny'' (whatever that is supposed to be, but it is a
quote from a Danish newspaper and Danish comedy may have its own
particular way of dying on an audience).
Alleged stand-up Mark Little is ''virtually funny'', which deserves to
be taken at its word. I've always hated ''grotesquely funny'' almost as
much as ''unsparingly funny'' because I habitually translate ''funny''
for ''desperate'' when I read the programme.
Article Two counsels you to be just as sceptical over the source of
these lifted quotes. Now, Jeff Green may be very proud of his ''awfully
good'' that he got from The Herald last year, but if this is the best he
has to show off then he may be in trouble. He is not sitting there
modestly on all those raves he got from The Independent, The Guardian
and Time Out. Scotsman quotes don't count because they're from Fringe
reviewer recruits who come cheap -- schoolchildren and pensioners in the
main.
It would have been better to use no quote at all than the well-meaning
imprimatur of the Hertfordshire Gazette, ill-advisedly cited by Big
Spirit Theatre Company to lend credibility to its adaptation of Primo
Levi's The Drowned And The Saved.
Brian Harries needs advice on how to use his precious 40 words to flog
his Don't Tell My Mother What I've Told You. ''A huge success'', he
quotes from the Western Telegraph, and then has to use up another
half-line to tell you that it is ''Wales' biggest weekly newspaper''.
''Do Not Miss'' Radio 2, is the best that Haggis &amp; Curry can offer to
promote their comedy revue. The confession that they actually listened
to Radio 2 to hear their show reviewed has pathos, but not much else to
recommend it.
Article Three entreats you to beware of shows bearing ''surprise
gifts'', as Back 2 Front Productions promise in their entry for The
Norman Conquests by Alan Ayckbourn. Coffee and bagels, promises the Hi
Energy Show, free G&amp;T with The Luvvies' Guide, win a free dinner for two
at Dog, Food, Dad, and a supper snack included in your ticket price for
Pop Goes Yer Life!
If all this sounds suspiciously tacky, the enticement of
''strawberries straight from their cleavage'' from Club Swing --
Appetite is only marginally more decent than the ''dildo juggling''
offered by Plush . . . An Intimate Revue, and I don't know why I'm
trying to sound disapproving because I'll probably go and see them both.
But the general point remains valid, free gifts indicate an inferior
product, and since you will encounter enough that is below standard you
might as well try to eliminate a few obvious ones at the outset.
It is no easy job. As you sit with your programme planning your sortes
and interlocking schedules that get you from Venue 114 to Venue 32 with
five minutes to spare, you know that Venue 114 will be going up 20
minutes late and Venue 32 will cancel that show halfway through the run.
You will be forced to start busking it, all your carefully prepared
selections being abandoned until you read the reviews, or someone tells
you about a show you can't afford to miss and you had marked it as a
must weeks before.
This is all part of the Fringe experience. You will repeat all the
mistakes of previous years and stumble through to find some new gem of a
show in a place you never expected it to be.
That is just about the only guarantee the Fringe can offer you, but it
is still pleasant to sit with that programme for a little longer now
before the whole thing goes crazy again for another year.

TRICKY things these days, the theatre. ''Twenty years ago,'' says Jack
Shepherd, ''you'd never think of having to raise money to sponsor
yourself to put on a play''. Shepherd, whose last visit to the Edinburgh
Fringe was to the old Traverse in 1973, is now returning with a jazzy
little number, Chasing the Moment, and is noticing the difference.
Musing on the way history has come full circle, as writer, leading
actor, and manager of Chasing the Moment, Shepherd has now taken on the
mantle of that almost extinct theatrical species, the actor-manager.
It's Shepherd's own money that is underwriting the enterprise thanks to
Wycliffe, the highly successful HTV series in which he has been starring
as the saturnine West Country detective.
One of the leading actors of his generation and for at least two
decades (he was one of Bill Bryden's golden boys during his epoch-making
spell at the National in the eighties) Shepherd, as it turns out, is
also a jazz enthusiast. At 16, he says, he'd have given anything to be a
jazz musician.
''I've always had it in my mind to write a play about jazz. I knew I
could write the characters because I could remember the way the
musicians spoke though I hadn't got a plot.'' Chasing the Moment which
follows the fortunes of a lacklustre south London group, the Les Padmore
Quartet, in fact took two years to write. Originally scheduled for a pub
theatre where Shepherd had already had a success with a previous play,
by the time he'd finished, ''unfortunately the pub had stopped doing
plays''.
The only person, Shepherd recalls, who was really interested in
putting it on was Richard Eyre (the National's director) whom Shepherd
knew as a friend. ''He wasn't interested in putting it on in the
Cottesloe. But he believed the way to do it was to get actors who could
also play instruments really well.''
In the event, that is exactly what Shepherd did. It obviously worked.
At its first showing at a small fringe venue in Southwark, it packed
them out, despite battling against a heatwave. This time, too -- and
appropriately for a smoky jazz club setting staged in the Pleasance's
cabaret bar -- alongside Shepherd on piano, are actors who also just
happen to play and blow up a storm, including world-class jazz
guitarist, actor Paul Stacey, and bass player Jim Bywater among them.
The play itself is set in Peckham -- according to Shepherd one of the
most deprived places in London. ''It's a desert, predominantly black,
very, very poor with no evident sign of culture. I did a lot of talking
to people who lived there (and to other friends and black actors) about
what life was like and decided to put the jazz club there with its
owner, Wes -- a roguish character you never see but based on a West
Indian musician who died a few years ago. In the play, he's formed this
club as some kind of antidote to the horrific anti-culture he sees all
around him.''
A play that highlights racial and group tensions -- about the only
thing that really bind this group is their love of jazz -- the far more
important thing Shepherd hopes the play shows ''are the similarities
between cultures rather than the differences''. Highlighting too the
tensions between the members of the band and their various wives and
girl-friends, with its cool music, sharp, street-wise dialogue (no
surprise to learn David Mamet is one of his writing role-models;
Shepherd has been a superb interpreter of the American's work as an
actor), this is one cocktail hour be sure you take in early.
* Cabaret Bar, The Pleasance, Edinburgh -- Aug 9-19, 3pm, Aug 20-28,
2.30pm; Aug 29-Sept 3, 3pm (no perfs Tues). Box-office: 0131-556-6550.

OVER recent years the Edinburgh Festival proper has washed its hands
of the visual arts. Their loss. If the director was clever, he could
take credit for an excellent exhibition programme without even putting
his hand in his pocket. He choses to remain aloof, merely providing a
long list at the back of the Festival brochure.
Happily the free, multicolour, expanded 70-page Edinburgh Gallery
Guide gives more details, and it's free (sponsored by the Bank of
Scotland in celebration of its 300th anniversary).
A flick through this brochure itemising more than 50 galleries reveals
that the most closely packed pages belong to the Scottish National
Galleries whose programme this year does them proud. Altogether they
present seven top-class shows which range from contemporary work through
to old masters.
Not to be missed are Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud in From London at
the Gallery of Modern Art or the major blockbuster, Light from the Dark
Room: A Celebration of Scottish Photography, at the Royal Scottish
Academy.
The Scots took a leading, pioneer role in the art of photography from
its inception in the 1840s when Hill Adamson made the famous images of
Newhaven fisherfolk. Their 5000 prints form the core of the original
collection. Since 1984 the National Gallery has added to this, and can
now boast 20,000 items. Will this show galvinise a pressure group to
agitate for a permanent home for these precious works? I trust so.
Lottery money is now available. Go to it!
But the most popular exhibition could prove to be The Cosways: Regency
Artists of Taste and Fashion at the Scottish National Portait Gallery.
This extravaganza has hitched a ride on the back of the new Merchant
Ivory film, Jefferson in Paris, starring Nick Nolte and Greta Scacchi
who plays Maria Cosway. Maria was beautiful, hugely talented as both
artist and musician, determined and original, yet as the title confirms,
she seems destined to be forever bracketed with her husband Richard --
or worse -- merely remembered as Jefferson's mistress.
Scacchi, more than any art historical reassessment, may at least get
Maria's name widely known once more. Back in the 1780s Maria Cosway, a
talented artist and musician, was at the epicentre of an extraordinary
international circle of friends and lovers who included not just
Jefferson, but the painter Jacques-Louis David, Canova of the Three
Graces fame, Sir Thomas Lawrence, the architect Sir John Soane, General
Paoli, and members of the Bonaparte family.
She trained under Angelica Kaufman, with instruction from Zoffany and
encouragement by Wright of Derby. But after her father died in Florence,
this young Anglo-Italian was brought to London in the hope of making a
good match. Richard Cosway, 17 years her senior, small ''with a monkey
face, apish figure and insane dandyism'', moved in elevated circles and
had just secured the patronage of the Prince of Wales. The Prince not
only acquired his miniatures, but also employed him to advise on his
collection and on the decoration of his home, Carlton House. Cosway was
made. Despite his ambiguous sexuality, a beautiful bride was needed to
complete the picture. The ravishing, charismatic Maria fitted the bill.
Maria had exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy. Once married,
Richard Cosway refused to allow her to work professionally as a painter,
so, according to her own words, ''instead of improving, I lost what I
had brought from Italy of my studies''.
After her liaison with Jefferson (then 41 and a widower), she left for
Italy where, in later life, she set up a school. They corresponded
passionately for the rest of their lives.
The exhibition includes many pretty miniatures by her husband, ''the
social lion'', and oils by herself together with costumes from the film.
Romantic to a fault, full of rococo, beautiful, be-jewelled images and
glamorous settings, the exhibition recalls the days when the only place
to be seen was at the Cosways' soirees; when the area around their Pall
Mall house (''a fairy palace'') was ''blocked with carriages, sedan
chairs, linkboys and lackeys carrying folk from the beau monde.
Also high on the scale is Hidden Assets: Scottish Paintings from the
Flemings Collection. Those lucky enough to visit Flemings Holdings Ltd
at their London address know the full glory of their corporate
collection, scattered in every corner of the building from foyer and
boardroom to offices and corridors. Now you can see 50 of their finest
pictures in Edinburgh.
Flemings began collecting in 1968 -- a good time, prices were low --
and now have 700 pictures by 300 top painters from the period 1800 to
today. MacTaggart, the Glasgow Boys and Colourists feature strongly, but
recently they've focused on living artists. Flemings helped pioneer the
concept of pictures in offices while at the same time fostering Scottish
art. If only there were more like them!
Everyone has heard and read about The Three Graces. They cost #7.6
million. Are they worth it? Find out at the National Gallery of Scotland
on the Mound. Here they are surrounded by historical documentation,
sketches, terracotta models, letters and such like. But what interests
most people is absent: the acres of shock-horror press cuttings.
Rarely did a neo-classical sculpture give rise to such media
attention. Some wonder what all the fuss was about. There was much talk
of ''national treasure'', yet this marble from 1815-17 is no more
British than the Mona Lisa. It was commissioned by an Englishman from
Canova, a Venetian artist who originally made the sculpture for a French
empress which is now in St Petersburg.
In 1817 it cost 3000 guineas. Until 1984 it sat happily in its
original home at Woburn Abbey. Then the sculpture was offered to the
government for #1.2m to settle a tax bill, but was turned down. It
aroused little interest until 1989 when the Getty Museumn in Malibu,
near Los Angeles, tried to buy it. Suddenly all hell broke loose.
It took six years of controversy, claims and counter claims to resolve
the problem -- and ''save it for the nation''. In fact the nation wasn't
very interested. Public appeals brought a measly #80,000. Timothy
Clifford, director of the SNG, became involved in 1993 and eventually
got money from Paul Getty II, son of the founder of the Malibu museum.
However, during last year's Festival our Tim put his foot well and truly
in it when he speculated live on the air waves that Paul Getty's
generosity was motivated by a grudge against his late father, an oil
baron notorious for his meanness, and refusal to pay a ransom for his
grandson, who had his ear cut off during the ordeal.
Getty immediately threatened to withdraw his #1m. Clifford offered
profuse apologies , grovelling on radio, TV, and in every newspaper.
Getty relented.
After more export licence extensions, appeals and rejections, at last
The Three Graces has a home -- at least for the next four years. Then it
goes to London with the occasional sortie to Madrid. So was it worth
#7.5m? Go see what you think and please write to let us know.: c/o The
Three Graces, Herald Features, Albion St, G1.

ART lovers who are flocking to Edinburgh for the Festival are faced
with a cornucopia of delights but though much of what they see will
impress them, it will be completely beyond their own hopes of ever
possessing anything like it.
For most people there's no point dreaming about owning a marble
sculpture like The Three Graces but it is not necessary to aim so high.
Now is the time to think about collecting drawings.
There is a magnificent collection of French drawings on show at the
National Gallery as well as an exhibition devoted to the work of husband
and wife artists Richard and Maria Cosway which includes some stunning
drawings, including a self-portrait Richard Cosway did of himself in
1800.
Drawings have been for a long time the poor relations of the art world
but last month Sotheby's decided to give drawings from Britain and the
Continent, from the seventeenth until the twentieth centuries, a sale to
themselves because until now collectors have had to hunt for them in
dealers' portfolios or tucked away between more important paintings in
sales catalogues.
Henry Wemyss, Sotheby's drawings expert, feels that if people knew
where to find drawings, there would be far more collectors.
For his first sale line-up he had works by Millais, Romney, Ingres,
George Chinnery, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Rossetti, Fuseli, and Holman Hunt
-- all names that would induce a fine frenzy if the works on offer were
paintings. There was not such a spontaneous outburst of buying nor was
the sale as successful as Mr Wemyss had hoped. Instead of being
disappointed, he feels that the market is poised on the brink of an
upsurge and that this is the time to buy. He gave me his tips about what
to look for.
He says that whereas the name of the artist matters a great deal when
buying a painting, it is not so important in a drawing so the snobbery
quotient does not count and people should trust their eyes and make
their own judgments about a drawing.
One of the things to look for is economy of effort which is very
striking if it works. Henry Wemyss also advises that would-be collectors
should cut through the boundaries of nationality and date -- don't just
concentrate on French art or British art, on twentieth-century drawings
or eighteenth-century ones, but mix them and buy what you like. ''The
only guideline to adhere to is to buy quality,'' he said.
People sometimes hold back from buying a drawing because it looks as
if it is only a sketch for a more elaborate work, but not to buy is a
mistake if you like it because often a preliminary sketch has more
freshness that the subsequent picture that is worked on painstakingly.
The catalogue of the sale gives a picture of the huge variety of the
drawings market because pictures for sale ranged from chalk, pen and
ink, and pencil and wash to coloured crayons. The subjects, too, showed
a huge variety and ranged from a George Frederic Watts portrait of Effie
Gray, who was to marry and divorce John Ruskin, to an unfinished sketch
of a kneeling woman by the French artist Alfred Dehodencq (1822-1882).
This sketch was part of the preliminary work for an oil painting
entitled The Execution but it has a wonderful freshness and vitality.
Its estimate was only around #700.
Henry Wemyss says that he probably overestimated at around #180,000
the most expensive picture in the sale which was a drawing by Johann
Fuseli (1741-1825), showing events in Shakespeare's King Lear when
Edgar, pretending he is mad, approaches King Lear on the heath. In the
event it did not sell but it gave an idea of the heights to which
exceptional drawings might one day aspire.
* BIKERS be ready for a sale of antique bicycles scheduled by Phillips
in Edinburgh for August 28. One of the star lots will be a 1901 Singer
believed to have been specially made for George Bernard Shaw, who was
exceptionally tall. The bike has a double bar to bear his weight. The
organising expert for this sale is Nicholas Oddy of Glasgow School of
Art who rides around the city on an 1897 tricycle with paraffin
headlamps.
There will be more details in this column nearer the time.

* MARINA ABRAMOVIC, Fruitmarket Gallery July 29-Sept 9.
HUGE giant chairs, snakes as head-dress, crystal clogs, nude bodies?
For 20 years Marina Abramovic has performed: in public, in private, on
the Great Wall of China. A heady personality with a baroque mind, her
whole life has been theatrical, encouraged by a volatile father, a war
hero partisan who became a Yugoslav general.
In 1973 she made her first video piece. She also performed at the
Demarco Gallery, using a knife. In 1975 she met Ulay, her partner for
the next 12 years. Together they lived a wild, nomadic life, making art.
Latterly they spent nine months in central Australia travelling along
ancient songlines.
Abramovic says she wanted to use her body as her raw material, just as
a painter would use colours or a sculptor stone or bronze. Since 1989
she has made powerful sculpture in various materials. Abramovic's new
work includes a seven-metre high steel chair, now installed on the
Fruitmarket roof. The show includes a retrospective of sculpture after
1989 and documentation on early solo performances from the 1970s.
Every Festival deserves a charismatic, avant garde artist. For 1995
it's Abramovic.
* JERWOOD PAINTING PRIZE, Royal Scottish Academy Aug 14-Sept 3.
WHO will win this #30,000 prize? Go and vote, for although there's a
panel of six, your say is important.
It's a sign of the times that we need the Jerwood Prize. Painting is
nowadays almost a covert activity. My postbag tells me that many
graduates feel they will be frowned on if they so much as pick up a
brush. Ridiculous! Still, one look at the Jerwood should reassure them.
The Jerwood shortlist is Maggie Hambling, Patrick Caulfield, Karl
Weschke, and our own Callum Innes, who is also nominated for the Turner
prize.
* POWER AND GOLD, Royal Museum of Scotland July 14-Nov 12.
FAIRYTALE dreamtime here! Two hundred and fifty pieces of lavish,
luscious gold jewellery: eighteenth and nineteenth-century bracelets,
necklaces, earrings and crowns, from Indonesia, Malaysia, and the
Philippines, loaned by the famous Barbier-Muller collection in
Switzerland. Superb.
* JOHN BELLANY, Talbot Rice Centre, Aug 10-Sept 10.
OVER the last 30 years Bellany has carved out a position as one of
Britain's top artists. Although he has done this in England and abroad,
he retains close links with Scotland, visiting regularly, so it is right
that Scotland claims him as one of its stars.
This double-hander looks at both his paintings and prints. Bellany is
a superb draughtsman so, with printmaking essentially linear, it is
understandable that he has a long career as a printmaker, with over 200
etchings and screenprints to his name -- 70 star here, including some
done specially for the show.
* BARBARA RAE, Scottish Gallery, Aug 11-Sept 6.
IT'S a long time since Barbara Rae had a major show in Scotland but
London has seen her more often, with a move to stronger, bolder colour
evident in her last metropolitan exhibition. Her subject however remains
the same: the hilly, rugged landscapes of her favourite north-west
Scotland, and of Spain and of Tuscany.
Rae's form of abstraction allows for the resonance of an age-old
terrain, which is also examined in a new suite of ten prints editioned
in Strathay, Sutherland, by Mike Rand, ex-Royal College. All the
paintings are new.

NOT so very long ago you had to comb the Fringe brochure, entry by
entry, to discover what you already suspected: not much dance and little
or none of it by companies you might have heard of.
But, there was a time when things were very different. A nostalgic
riffle through programmes of 10 or 12 years ago throws up a host of
names to conjure with -- Bill T Jones and Arnie Zane duetting at the
Assembly Rooms. The enigmatic Micha Bergese simultaneously cooking up
food and dance in a brilliant solo at the Belford Dance Centre . . .
yes, these things really happened on the Fringe.
And now it looks as if those dearly-remembered times have come again.
This year's Fringe brochure boasts an entire section headed Dance And
Physical Theatre. Add in those other shows that have slipped through the
classifications and you can choose from more than 50 different
performances.
Start scanning the venues involved and one name crop ups repeatedly.
St Bride's Centre in Orwell Terrace. Remember the Monolith in 2001? How
its presence was always a harbinger -- and promoter -- of change. Well,
St Bride's is a chip off that catalytic block.
Three years ago, at a time when dance didn't really figure on the
Fringe, St Bride's elected to become a dedicated dance venue offering a
variety of performances and workshops under the title of Continental
Shifts. It was a bold move -- but there was a striking amount of strong,
eminently watchable dance and a useful sprinkling of the decidedly
different.
The success of that first season not only encouraged George
Williamson, who runs the centre as a community resource throughout the
year; it also triggered off a degree of interest among other Fringe
programmers.
''Since we started, the whole dance thing has really taken off across
the board. And yes, we were a wee bit wary when the Festival began to
pay so much attention to its dance programme,'' says Williamson.
More applications than ever before, however, have been arriving on his
desk. The benefits of being part of an established set-up, complete with
its own press person, cafe facilities, and properly fitted-out theatre
space are obvious and attractive.
In part, this year's line-up keeps faith with groups who have helped
shape the venue's reputation. Ricochet Dance -- increasingly seen as one
of the most polished young companies offering work by innovative
choreographers -- has been a constant since the beginning. So, too, has
the redoubtable Piers Gielgud with his group, The Re-Animators.
Williamson says: ''It's an important balance. We don't want to end up
showing only what you might call the politically-correct end of the
dance world. We need a bit of blood on the carpet, so to speak!
Something that takes the risks, maybe even divides the audiences. But
that variety of programme is what works best and we're holding true to
that.''
Contributing to that variety are, among others, the Mark Baldwin
Company -- currently in receipt of multiple superlatives from Britain's
leading critics -- and Divas, in the solo form of Liz Aggiss, a truly
exuberant spirit well-versed in the quirks of everyday absurdity.
Physical theatre gets its customary look-in with a new piece by The
Brian Collective, inspired by the mystic forms of magic realism and
underpinned by a flamenco score. Black Theatre Co-opertive celebrate the
spirit of Zumbi (a seventeenth-century Brazilian freedom fighter) in an
epic music and movement-theatre production.
Alongside this, there's the Centre's commitment to local performers.
''I'm keen to involve local people because this centre doesn't just
operate during the Fringe, like some venues,'' says Williamson. ''We're
here, as part of the community, all year.'' He's programmed two local
groups -- Vestris-Cassiel and suddenlylastsummer -- and reckons they'll
not let the side, or St Bride's, down.
I doubt if anyone, least of all George Williamson, envisaged the
sudden broad swing to dance that has been occasioned by the example of
St Bride's, with its reasonable ticket prices, agreeable food, and a
programme that runs from mid-afternoon until late. A truly dedicated
dance venue, still setting the pace for others to follow.

MARY BRENNAN shows you how to step out in style with the Festival's
now high-profile dance element.
THERE'S the teensiest whiff of ''why fix it, if it isn't broken?''
about this year's Edinburgh Festival dance programme. What do I mean?
Quite simply, there are no unknown quantities on this year's bill --
which is not to say that there won't be some surprises.
Director Brian McMaster has chosen to bring back four companies who
have already proved attractive to the ticket-buying public. I've no real
quarrel with that. It's always easy to assume that a Festival of this
size and status should be doing certain things: going on cultural
safaris to bag coveted -- and utterly exclusive -- trophies, for
instance, or showcasing home teams on its international platform.
But why jeopardise carefully nurtured standards just for the sake of
novelty or misplaced chauvinism? The Fringe is likely to provide us with
both, though not -- at a first glance anyway -- in overwhelming
quantities. My one gripe is that, despite rewarding audience figures,
there is actually less dance this year than last.
There is, however, the welcome return of the Mark Morris Dance Group
for the fourth year running. I doubt if it's any coincidence that --
since Morris's first dynamic showing here four years ago -- the overall
interest in dance has increased, not just in terms of the Festival but
within the Edinburgh area itself.
So, what's he bringing us! A programme of shorts that includes some
new repertoire and a welcome revival of a 1985 duet, One Charming Night.
Long before Tom Cruise cut his fangs on Interview with a Vampire, Morris
was choreographing a duet of biting passion, piquantly set to songs by
Purcell. Divinely tasty! And then, there's The Hard Nut . . .
You could say that this is meltdown time for Sugar Plums as Morris
puts a new, and ironic, spin on that favourite bonbon of a classical
ballet: The Nutcracker.
At the other end of the spectrum -- in a nice touch of programming --
is Balanchine's Nutcracker, performed (for the first time ever outside
America) by Miami City Ballet who deservedly became one of last year's
hot tickets.
While other choreographers sought to lard the story with Freudian
resonances, Balanchine preferred to trust the music and movement he had
loved (and performed) as a boy in Russia. The result is a ballet that
doesn't have to be hastily packed out of sight come Twelfth Night.
The themes explored in Still/Here -- given its only British
performances at the Festival -- are continually being hurried out of
sight, pushed to the no-go recesses of our mind. Still/Here looks,
without flinching, at our mortality. It uses words, gestures and video
images from a series of workshops with terminally ill people. Bill T
Jones has choreographed a tender celebration of life and the will to
survive that is both poignant and uplifting.
Nelken -- marking the welcome return of Pina Bausch to the Edinburgh
Festival -- is, in its own terms, also about confrontation, endurance
and survival. As her company pick their way through a field of flowers
(Nelken means ''carnations'') they encounter setbacks and humiliations.
And yet, love still finds its way into this confusion of circumstances
and emotions.
Those who saw her at the 1992 Festival, with the hauntingly intimate
chamber piece Cafe Muller, will find this large-scale installation a
surprising contrast. And this, perhaps, is the real attraction of
McMaster's programming. By bringing companies back -- and quickly back
-- he allows the increasing number of loyal audiences to get closer to a
company's work. To see -- as with Mark Morris -- the range and
versitility of both choreographer and performers. Prior to McMaster's
tenure, there was a broken-down air to the essentially low-profile dance
element in the Festival. Four years on and it's most surely fixed!

* Tap Dogs at venue 26 -- The Palladium. August 11 to September 2 (not
15, 22) 7pm.
A hotsy-potsy, hellzapoppin' outburst of tap dancing from an
Australian team. This is the nineties on tap -- singlets and workboots
instead of top hats and tails . . . seriously sexy, so I'm told.
* Mark Baldwin Dance Company at venue 62, St Bride's Centre, August 21
to 26, 6pm.
A double bill of fresh, beautifully crafted dance from a tremendously
gifted young choreographer. Baldwin's innate musicality, his eye for
revealing detail are well-served by some of Britain's finest dancers.
* Company Pyke -- venue 33, The Pleasance, August 22 to September 2,
3.40pm.
PSSST! Members of Cando Co come together in a pithy, funny piece that
tackles society's attitudes to disability.
* Compagnie Herve-Gil, venue 22, Demarco European Art Foundation,
August 10 to 19, (not 13) 9.10pm.
One of the highlights of last year's Fringe. This French company had
it all and more. They're back and highly recommended.
* Compagnie Yvette Bozsik, Dundee Rep August 21, 23 and 25, 5pm and
9.30pm.
Demarco has extended his cultural Fiefdom to Dundee and Yvette Bozsik
is, however, truly worth travelling to see. Her interpretation of one
woman's journey towards insanity -- based on the novel The Yellow
Wallpaper -- is likely to be as unforgettable as her other, utterly
haunting performances on the Fringe.

Dipping into the main Festival theatre programme, SARA VILLIERS finds
a happy mix of European talent.
SHAKESPEARE by the Berliner Ensemble, frothy French comedy by
Schaubuhne Am Lehniner Platz of Berlin, a classic of the German
repertory set in the era of the Spanish Inquisition by the Citizens'
Theatre Company, Glasgow; at first glance the theatre programme of the
Edinburgh International Festical signals an intriguing European cultural
mix, but it is a coincidental one, claims Brian McMaster, Festival
Director. ''Resonances do come up but they are accidental,'' he says.
While the Berliner Ensemble are producing The Merchant of Venice,
Schaubuhne Am Lehniner Platz are undertaking the wry observational
humour of Sacha Guitry with two elegant comedies, The Illusionist and
Let's Dream, and the Citizens' are presenting a new production of
Schiller's Don Carlos -- translated by Robert David MacDonald, directed
and designed by Philip Prowse and featuring the third member of the
Citizens' trinity, Giles Havergal, as Philip II, King of Spain -- other
companies are producing work closer to their home turf.
Both Scotland's TAG and Ireland's Abbey Theatre are presenting work
which is indelibly linked to their country's culture, respectively an
adaptation of Alasdair Gray's Lanark (previewed on page 18) and a
timeous revival of Frank McGuiness' coruscating exploration of
Ulstermen's experiences of the First World War, Observe the Sons of
Ulster Marching towards the Somme, originally produced last year as a
tribute to the ceasefire declared in Northern Ireland.
The exuberant Deschamps et Deschamps return to Edinburgh with a madcap
operetta, C'est Magnifique, an ebullient cross between circus and opera
which showcases the French command of slapstick physical theatre,
invoking inevitable comparisons to Jacques Tati. In contrast to
Deschamps et Deschamps' brazen performance style is the disquieting
menace of another French production, Dans la Solitude des Champs de
Coton by Bernard-Marie Koltes.
It's an exceptionally varied and exceptionally accessible programme,
featuring names familiar to and beloved of festival-goers; TAG and the
Citizens' need little introduction here and both captivated
international audiences in 1993 with the trilogy A Scots Quair (TAG) and
The Soldiers (Citizens); Deschamps et Deschamps are making their third
visit and last delighted Edinburgh in 1989 with C'est Dimanche, the
Berliner Ensemble produced a stunning and sensuous Antony and Cleopatra
last year which featured the acclaimed Gert Voss and Eva Mattes who now
tackle Shylock and Portia, and the Abbey also appeared in 1994, after a
Festival absence of some 20 years, with Synge's The Well of the Saints.
Perhaps the most unfamiliar work is Koltes's. He is a playwright who
is largely uncelebrated outside his home country, despite the fact that
he is one of the three contemporary writers most performed there.
Koltes, who died in 1989, is renowned for a challenging and
intellectually aggressive approach. Dans la Solitude . . . is a densely
layered work, a two-hander in the form of a philosophical verbal duel
between a dealer and his client who debate an abstract transaction.
Nuance of language is vitally important and an English translation of
the text will be sent to all ticket buyers, but the performances of
Pascal Greggory and Patrice Chereau, who also directs, promise to be
compelling. Chereau, a world-class director, has not staged work in the
UK for almost 20 years but his name is familiar to film fans, for having
recently directed La Reine Margot in which Greggory starred.
Judging by advance ticket bookings the Guitry plays are proving more
difficult to pitch at audiences, although he is arguably the most
popular and the most performed playwright in France. However, McMaster
is confident that sales will pick up, especially considering the plays
are being produced by the same company, and perhaps more significantly,
the same inspirational director, the Swiss-born Luc Bondy (who has
divided his career between the Schaubuhne and Patrice Chereau's Theatre
des Amandiers at Nanterre, near Paris) who dazzled the Festival last
year with the mesmerising ''play without words'', The Hour We Knew
Nothing of Each Other.
The Guitry bill also presents a further opportunity to witness Gert
Voss in action, as he plays the title role in The Illusionist, the tale
of Teddy Brooks, the Illusionist of the Alhambra Theatre in Paris, who
captivates with magic trickery and enchants with charisma -- a starkly
contrasting role to that of Shylock. McMaster is thrilled to have
orchestrated this, describing it with barely disguised glee. ''To be
able to see this great German-speaking actor play Shylock and then the
Illusionist over the course of a few nights (The Merchant of Venice on
August 29 and 30, The Illusionist on September 1 and 2) is something
which is really quite unique.''
There are clearly many bonuses to the '95 programme; even the most
dedicated theatre goer can't help but admit to a sneaking sense of
relief that the endurance tests on concentration and bladder of last
year, most significantly the seven-and-a-half-hour Oresteia, are absent
from this year's line-up, where the longest show is Don Carlos, at an
eminently modest three hours and 15 minutes.
This is a feature which has not escaped McMaster's notice, it having
been mentioned to him continually. Indeed, his oft-quoted slogan, which
he obligingly trots out on cue, is that ''1994 was the year of the long
show and 1995 is the year of the long title''.
The longest, of course, is McGuinness's mouthful, Observe the Sons of
Ulster Marching towards the Somme. McMaster admits that having already
invited back the Berliner Ensemble and the Schaubuhne, he was initially
reluctant to have the Abbey again so soon but he couldn't ignore the
insistence of the Abbey's artistic director, Patrick Mason, that he see
the show in Dublin. Once there he was smitten. ''I walked up to Patrick
in the interval and said, 'You bastard! I knew I had to have them back.
Once I had seen the show there was simply no choice in the matter'.''

* GERDA Stevenson (Performing in A Place with the Pigs, Communicado,
Traverse
Theatre, Aug 13-Sept 2, various times)
Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, Abbey Theatre,
King's Theatre: I want to see it partly because of director Patrick
Mason whose work I've followed and admired in plays like last year's The
Well of the Saints and Peacock Theatre's The Great Hunger from a few
years ago. And I just think the Irish actors are wonderful.
The Merchant of Venice, Berliner Ensemble, Royal Lyceum: It will be
very interesting to see what the Germans do with it, particularly with
Shylock and all that.
Take the Floor, Market Theatre, Traverse Theatre: I'm interested
partly because I'm doing the Athol Fugard play and also because as a
child I spent 18 months in South Africa. The Edinburgh Festival is a
tremendous opportunity to see work from abroad and I think you should
make the most of that.

* MAKING tips for outstanding Fringe shows could easily be a sure-fire
bet. It's tempting to suggest tried and tested productions. But that
would be antithetical to the spirit of the Fringe. There should always
be an element of gamble, of risk.
So, I'll try Masterpieces by Blow Up. The company are unknown to me
but I read the play in the mid eighties and it made a big impact.
Written by the British dramatist Sarah Daniels, it's a feminist agitprop
piece, with shocking references and some highly emotive dialogue about
''snuff movies''. I suspect it might now strike me as very much a
product of its time but I'm still intrigued.
Another female playwright next; Sue Glover's atmospheric account of
the lives of six women working the land in nineteenth century Scotland,
Bondagers. Through chance and circumstance I've missed seeing this in
its previous incarnations so I'm delighted the Traverse are reviving it
again.
Dahlings, I just adored last year's Gee Wow! The Live and Times of
Clive Neon, a hilarious one-man show. It was written by Stephen Dinsdale
and I'm looking forward to his new show, the quirkily titled Ken and
Barb -- A Day in the Life of a Supermodel. A comic four-hander on
Plasticine people, it looks like a nice, light teatime treat with the
further nudge, nudge, allure of ''definitely not for children''.
Somewhat bizarrely this is also a recommendation for the National
Youth Music Theatre's production of The Threepenny Opera, Brecht's
depiction of prostitutes and gangsters obviously deemed to salty for
children to watch, if not to perform.
Last, but not least, another stab in the dark with Ningali, an
enigmatic one-woman show at the Traverse by Josie Ningali Lawford. It's
an autobiographical odyssey of her life from the Australian outback to
Alaska, from Aborigine tribal traditions to dates with rock stars. Which
ones? I need to know more.

There was a time when there was a certain something lacking on the
operatic front. Now valiant efforts are being made to fill the gap,
notes CONRAD WILSON.
RIMSKY-KORSAKOV'S operas are no longer a closed book to Edinburgh
Festival audiences. Placed in the context of Russian opera in general --
of works by Glinka, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky -- and thanks to the
increasing availability of authentic stagings, they are steadily
re-establishing themselves in the imperial Russian performances they
need if their splendours are to be properly conveyed.
Scottish Opera once had a striking production of The Golden Cockerel
in its repertoire, but eventually sold it to America.
This year, thanks to the Kirov Opera from St Petersburg, we shall see
Sadko filled with seascapes as rich as those of Sherazade, and The
Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, full of the birds, flowers, and
forests that Rimsky also loved. Summer memories, he once confessed,
haunted his music, along with visions of an Old Russia in which people,
as he put it, lived by the seasons, told their tales, laughed and loved,
invented their songs and felt awe at the wonders of the universe.
For a composer often accused of being merely mechanical Rimsky has a
radiant musical message to deliver in each of these works, but much will
depend on how effectively the Kirov presents it and on how patiently we
listen to it. The music is undeniably leisurely. Each piece lasts four
hours, even a work as familiar as Sherazade, in an unsympathetic
performance, has its longueurs.
But with Valery Gergiev as conductor the two operas -- the seventh and
fifteenth of the 16 Rimsky wrote -- are in hands as exciting as can be
hoped for. Each work contains memorable scenes. In Sadko, Venetian
Viking and Indian merchants sing colourfully on the quayside. In Kitezh,
the prolonged ringing of church bells inspired some authorities to hail
this mixture of Christianity and Pantheism as Rimsky's Parsifal. London
heard a concert performance of it last year, but Edinburgh's full
staging by a company of 275 should trump that previous event.
Not that concert performances -- especially at a time when so many
productions seem ignorantly wrong-headed -- are to be despised. Indeed,
the chance to hear Glinka's Russlan and Ludmilla, one of the foundation
stones of Russian opera, in that way at the Usher Hall is more than
welcome. Most of us know it only for its fizzing overture, though that
(think of Bernstein's Candide) is no proof that the rest of Russlan is a
success.
But whether or not it works theatrically, the score brims with fine
music that the Kirov's performance should disclose at strength. Outside
Russia, companies rarely perform it. Yet the story is attractive. A tale
of three suitors who set off from Kiev to rescue Ludmilla, who has been
abducted by a wicked wizard, it is clearly the stuff of Russian
folk-tale.
Moreover, like the Rimsky pieces it contains memorable scenes, the
most haunting of which finds Russlan, the principal suitor, on an
ancient battlefield strewn with the bones of dead warriors and where a
gigantic head suddenly addresses him in the voice of an all-male choir.
If the concert performance proves a hit, perhaps the Kirov some future
year will show us how it stages this scene. Meanwhile we shall have
Gergiev to show us how it sounds.
To the Kirov's Russian Survey, Scottish Opera's new Dvorak production
should provide a useful Slavonic prelude. Again the work is a rarity.
Nobody knows much about The Jacobin, except that it is a comedy -- a
vein Dvorak has sometimes been considered too slow-moving to handle.
Characteristically, however, it is a comedy of feeling, through which
runs some very Czech sentiments about the poignancy of exile and about
the ability of music -- the hero and heroine are both musicians -- to
stir hearts and produce reconciliations. Richard Armstrong, who admits
to having failed in a previous attempt to champion the piece, is rightly
determined to have another shot at it, and to succeed this time. Most of
Dvorak's operas still need to be defended.
Almost an exact century before The Jacobin was first staged in Prague,
Mozart journeyed there from Vienna to direct the premier of Don
Giovanni. Ever since, conductors have had to choose between -- and have
sometimes conflated -- the Prague version of the opera and its revived
Viennese successor. Should Don Ottavio sing the difficult ''Il mio
tesoro'', as in Prague, or the easier ''Dalla sua pace'', as in Vienna,
or should he sing them both? Should Donna Elvira sing ''Mi tradi'',
added for Vienna? Should Leporello and Zerlina be given their farcical
duet, also added for Vienna, but seldom performed?
These are some of the questions Sir Charles Mackerras will be
addressing with his usual acumen, and to which he may provide unexpected
answers. Whichever version he chooses for this latest of his Mozart
performances with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, tied in with a
recording session, we can be sure that he will conduct it very fast,
with punchy rhythms, fierce drum strokes, and a wealth of fine
decoration.
As with his previous Mozart nights at the Usher Hall, he has recruited
an impressive international cast, with Boje Skovhus in the title-role,
Alessandro Corbelli as Leporello, and Felicity Lott as Donna Elivra.
Concert performances of opera, for better or worse, continue to be a
growth industry. Even bleeding chunks of Wagner are back in fashion, as
Donald Runnicles and the Royal SNO will demonstrate when they perform
the closing love scene from Siegfried and Act Three of Gotterdammerung
with Jane Eaglen as Brunnhilde, and Heinz Kruse as Siegfried.
Bernd Alois Zimmermann's Requiem for a Young Poet is not an opera,
though as a dissection of twentieth-century politics it is
overwhelmingly theatrical. Emmanuel Nunes's Quodlibet likewise seems
operatic in nature, even though it employs six percussionists, seven
solo instrumentalists, and what are described as ''21 itinerant
musicians'' instead of singers, as well as a gigantic clock. But what is
certainly an opera, in spite of its teasingly stretched title, is John
Adams's I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.
The subject is the recent Los Angeles earthquake and its effect on the
lives and loves of seven young Californians. Adams is strong on
contemporary topics, enclosing them in the bright music, a mixture of
lyricism and minimalism at which he is so adept, and in productions by
his fellow American Peter Sellars that capture to perfection his brittle
style. Edinburgh has already seen and enjoyed his Nixon in China.
Clearly, Brian McMaster has sufficient faith in the new work to give it
not only its European premiere but a run of six performances.

SCOTTISH contemporary music has always been a bit of an awkward cuss
to the Edinburgh Festival. How to acknowledge it, and how to incorporate
it into the Edinburgh programme, are problems that have received a token
nod from a succession of festival directors.
Sporadic attempts to address the issue have been made over the years.
Five years ago the Edinburgh Contemporary Arts Trust staged a couple of
Queen's Hall concerts in one day. In another year there was a series of
four concerts which were related to the wider context of John Purser's
groundbreaking Radio Scotland series, Scotland's Music.
Most recently -- and most effectively -- there was the broad survey,
two years ago, of the music of James MacMillan which was not only highly
topical but, by its nature, something of a one-off.
This year the Festival is adopting a different approach, and a
sensible one. It is collaborating with the BBC, which brings the BBC's
own studio concert hall in Queen Street into play, and (presumably)
gives the Festival events access to a wider platform via Radio Three.
There will be three concerts. They will take place on the three Sunday
afternoons of the Festival (the first therefore technically pipping at
the post, Claudio Abbado's evening concert at the Usher Hall as the
first concert of the Festival).
But the most interesting aspect of this year's Scottish events is
that, five years ago, they could not have happened in their present
format. And for a very simple reason. Five years ago none of the three
featured groups -- the Chamber Group of Scotland, the Hebrides Ensemble,
and the Yggdrasil Quartet of Aberdeen -- existed.
Each has its own distinctive character. The Hebrides, founded and run
by pianist Peter Evans and cellist William Conway, are pure steel. Part
of their remit was to limit the appearances of the group, and produce
nothing but the best.
The Chamber Group of Scotland, founded later in the same year (1991)
is directed by two of the country's top composers, James MacMillan and
Sally Beamish. To their concerts, the Chamber Group have brought a new
level of imaginative flair in programming and presentation.
To this mix has been added the young Nordic gods from Stockholm, the
Yggdrasils: four trendy young guys, less than a year into their Aberdeen
residency, who have already become the talking point of the music scene
with their breathtakingly virtuosic playing, and who have walked
straight into an Edinburgh Festival engagement and been booked already
to play with the Royal SNO next season.
Between them, the three groups will give a good survey of the state of
the art, with the world premiere of a BBC commission in each concert,
and wide-ranging music from senior figures such as Robert Crawford and
John McLeod, through the middle generation composers, represented by
Judith Weir and William Sweeney, and to some of the younger bloods, like
James Clapperton and Magnus Robb, who have new works being unveiled.
All concerts kick off at 2.30, and admission -- by ticket, obtainable
from the Festival box-office -- is free. Hear the state-of-the-art
groups playing music from the edge.

THERE is always something fascinating, challenging, or innovative
about the music programmes planned by Edinburgh International Festival
director Brian McMaster. Two years ago, his broad survey of the music of
James MacMillan, the first Scottish composer ever to feature prominently
in the Festival, was a particularly daring stroke. Equally bold --
because of its apparent extreme familiarity -- was his focus last year
on the music of Beethoven.
This year, McMaster -- presumably with the assistance of his associate
director, James Waters -- has surpassed himself. If Festival addicts
have scrambled through the brochure searching primarily for their
favourite orchestras, big-name stars, and a range of repertoire goodies
-- and there is no shortage of any of these -- they might actually have
failed to notice the extraordinary strength of this music programme;
McMaster himself, though an earthily expressive man, tends not to plant
lurid signposts or bray hyperbolically about the internal organisation
of the programme.
Simply put, the 1995 music programme is one of the finest I have ever
seen assembled, in this or any other Festival; and from a very
particular point of view: structure. There is more than mere scrupulous
planning here. This programme is built like a cathedral. There are great
pillars and arches spanning the three-week programme, as well as an
entire network of interconnecting, symmetrical, and complementary
strands to the fabric of what is, in its construction, an intellectual
and imaginative masterpiece.
Let's flesh this out. Buttressing either end of the Festival in its
opening and closing concerts are two vast pillars of music: Bruckner's
massive Eighth and Ninth Symphonies, enormous, gothic structures of
sonic architecture, which will be assembled by two great conductors of
different generations, the venerable Gunter Wand and -- on opening night
-- Claudio Abbado. The same composer's Fourth Symphony, equally solid,
will be a central support to the structure in the middle of the
Festival.
The other main pillars, more slender in dimensions and more
figurative, though equally structural, are represented in a survey of
the solo music for strings by J S Bach. In a mega-concert, estimated to
run for four hours, the great cellist Yo Yo Ma will undertake all six of
the Cello Suites in Greyfriars Kirk. Straddling the central week of the
intricate structure of this superb festival, violinist Thomas Zehetmair,
also in the Kirk, and in three late-night concerts on alternate
evenings, will play the Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin.
Fanning out on either side of these pillars will be twin arches,
surveys of music by Dvorak and, in the run-up to the bicentenary of his
birth, Schubert. The Dvorak theme, spanning essentially the first half
of the Festival, is broad and wide-ranging; the Schubert strand, in the
second half, is intense and concentrated.
Three of Dvorak's symphonies -- numbers 6, 7, and 8 -- will be played,
the latter two by arguably the best orchestra in the world (the St
Petersburg Philharmonic) with, also arguably, two of the best conductors
in the world (Yuri Temirkanov and Mariss Jansons). Less familiar will be
the two large-scale choral works -- the Stabat Mater and the Requiem.
And in a single marathon night in the Usher Hall, all three of the Czech
composer's concertos (including the unknown and usually dismissed Piano
Concerto) will be played.
A cross-section of Dvorak's chamber music -- three string quartets,
the sextet, and a group of masterworks for strings and piano, as well as
the woodwind Serenade -- will beef out the theme in the Queen's Hall.
The Schubert theme, perfectly counterbalancing the Dvorak, is
mindblowing. In three concerts from two orchestras on three consecutive
nights in the Usher Hall, six of Schubert's symphonies will be featured.
The two conductors for these concerts are living legends: Sandor Vegh,
90 this year and still going strong, and the awesome Gunter Wand, at 83
the youngster of the pair. Wand's concert, with the last two symphonies,
promises (like his Beethoven 5 and 6 last year) to be one of the great
nights of the Festival.
The other strand to the Schubert theme, itself perfectly symmetrical,
is a stroke of planning genius. On three alternate nights in the second
half of the Festival, double concerts -- one early, one late -- will be
staged in the Usher Hall. The six concerts will each feature a single
Schubert work: the three towering song cycles -- Die Schone Mullerin,
Winterreise, and Schwanengesang -- and the last three, epic, Piano
Sonatas.
Tenor Peter Schreier, accompanied by pianist Andras Schiff, will
perform the songs in the early evening, then the ultra-poetic Schiff
will take centre stage late night to play the Sonatas. As a piece of
structural planning it is breathtaking: simple and dazzling.
All the above -- multi-layered and interlocking -- are the structural
beams of the '95 Festival. Threaded around them are glittering
individual events with real stars: the outstanding pianist Maria Joao
Pires, the brilliant violinist Dmitri Sitkovesky, the exemplary Raphael
Ensemble, and the ravishing soprano Galina Gorchakova.
Immediately after three major performances in Edinburgh with the Kirov
Opera, Gorchakova will give a solo recital at the Queen's Hall. Last
year I was -- by chance -- standing two feet from the soprano in a BBC
studio when she unleashed her laser beam of a voice; the effect was
overwhelming. Her recital programme is unspecified; as far as I'm
concerned, she can come on and sing the St Petersburg telephone
directory.
And, spicing up the whole thing, there are the in-betweens: the
off-the-wall, the idiosyncratic, the bizarre, and the characterful, such
as Zimmermann's gargantuan and spatial Requiem with its massed choirs,
huge orchestra, jazz band, and electronic tape; and Messiaen's Catalogue
d'Oiseaux -- a vast avian thesaurus, seven books of piano music
comprising 13 pieces, lasting three hours, and based wholly on the
composer's transcriptions of birdsongs: another marathon, with pianist
Anatol Ugorski. Bring your own nest.
All in, a stupendous assemblage, a virtuoso display of musical muscle,
and an example of Festival programme-building that vibrates with sheer
brainpower. Mouth-watering, the lot of it. Can't wait.
Michael Tumelty's TOP 5.
* St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra/Jansons. (Sun 20, Usher Hall,
8pm)
THE two concerts by the great Russian orchestra represent the richest
pickings in the Festival. Mariss Jansons is first off with Dvorak's
gloriously melodic Eighth Symphony and Prokofiev's sizzling music for
Romeo and Juliet.
* St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra/Temirkanov. (Tue 22, Usher
Hall, 8pm)
THE inimitable master conductor and showman Yuri Temirkanov takes on
Dvorak's Seventh and Elgar's Enigma Variations -- can't imagine what the
latter will be like; probably unique.
* NDR Symphony Orchestra, Hamburg (Thu 31, Usher Hall, 8pm)
QUITE simply, this will be one of the most profound nights of the
Festival: the magical octogenarian Gunter Wand conducting Schubert's
Eighth and Ninth Symphonies.
* Ensemble Intercontemporain (Mon 28, Queen's Hall, 7.30pm)
THE Second Viennese School -- Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern -- get a
night out at the hands of the great French intellectual conductor,
Pierre Boulez, and his peerless ensemble.
* Andras Schiff (Sun 27, Usher Hall, 10.30pm)
THERE is a time to hear Schubert's last and greatest piano sonata. It
is music of the soul, and music of the night. In a perfect setting, and
with a perfect pianist, hear the endless, wonderful B flat Sonata. And
weep.

Ruth Wishart ia a veteran of Edinburgh's cultural battlefield. This is
her Festival survival guide.
THE Fire Brigade, in those days a fine body of men only, were
well-versed in the trade of risk assessment. But they had to concede
that figuring out the likely repercussions of an inflammatory incident
on a stage set comprising a number of holes with live heads popping up
was not necessarily all in the usual day's work.
But then Edinburgh in August is no place for those drawn to
predictability. And that particular Fringe offering, performed by
artists from what was then still Yugoslavia, was just a strand of a
particularly fine piece of summer madness which will celebrate its
golden jubilee next summer.
The Edinburgh International Festival, its sprawling Fringe, and the
satellite attractions of the prestigious Film Festival and the biennial
Book Festival, offer a rich diet of varied soul food such as you may
experience nowhere else in the world. London and New York, Paris and
Berlin may offer a more sustained diet of music and drama over the year,
but only in Edinburgh will you find such a concentration of talent over
such a timespan in a city whose compact centre allows the festival
spirit to flourish with an intensity not possible in larger towns with
more jaded palates.
Accept the word of this unreconstructed Glaswegian . . . Edinburgh's
festivals are pure dead brilliant.
For a while, in a different journalistic incarnation, I had the
privilege of living in its epicentre. And the moment the first
unicyclist saddled up on the pavement outside you felt the stirrings of
an instinctive grin which was going to be there for three weeks,
moderating only to allow an appropriate response to the odd Greek
melodrama or Russian orchestral megastar.
When I first moved there some of the Edinburgh citizenry clocked the
central location of the apartment and pronounced it the perfect
location. Why, I could rent it out for the Festival for serious money.
Happily such philistine pragmatism is no longer endemic. Edinburghers
make up the bulk of the audience even if the shops and hoteliers still
put their hands in very shallow pockets by way of thanks for the income
generated by their neighbourhood culturefest.
Oddly that same enthusiasm has yet to spread unchecked in the West.
Glasgow and Strathclyde make up a dismal percentage of festivalgoers
despite being no more than an hour distant. Market research has
suggested that their reluctance is not down to the infamous M8 rivalry,
but stems from the misapprehension that there's nothing much in the
Festival that they can't catch sooner or later in their own backyard.
Which is just plain daft. Of course Glasgow has built up significant
relationships with directorial gurus such as Peter Brook and Robert
Lepage. Of course it has been treated to superlative performances by
international companies. Of course it houses the Citz and Lally's
Palais.
But what makes the Edinburgh Festival unique is not merely that there
are some performances, especially these days in dance, which you just
can't see anywhere else, but that you can indulge in so many treats in
the same place at the same time.
Edinburgh in August is glorious proof that you can have too much of a
good thing and still clamour for more.
Every Edinburgh Festival director brings a different kind of emphasis
and a shopping list skewed to personal priorities. What the Frank Dunlop
period brought for instance -- outside of the bonus for the press corps
of Frank's own unrehearsed, unscheduled, but spectacularly dramatic
outbursts -- was a raft of superlative international drama.
Perhaps the company which came to be most closely associated with his
reign was the Japanese company ultimately named for its celebrated guru,
Ninagawa.
Now picture the scene. It is in the Old Quadrangle of the university,
where scaffolded seating and a stage have been erected for the Ninagawa
Medea. To plan outdoor performances in Edinburgh requires, according to
your taste, admirable chutzpah or clinical dementia. On this particular
night a particularly typical Scottish summer emerges. It is pouring.
Well, to be less economical with the actualite, it is stotting off the
flagstones. Yet there is a full house because word of this stunning
performance has already gone out on the Festival jungle drums.
The lead actor steps forward and says to the audience that of course
the company can still perform but he will understand if they wish to
leave and return in more clement conditions. They stay. And the actors
perform. And yet another audience sits enthralled gasping aloud at the
coup de theatre which is the finale as a floodlit chariot soars over the
turrets.
Less sublime and potentially ridiculous were the repeated visits of
the modestly numbered Swedish Folk Opera who gave wonderfully populist
performances of unlikely offerings such as Salome and Aida in the highly
unlikely surroundings of the Leith Theatre -- opened up and dusted down
and emerging temporarily from retirement for the purpose. If you have
never seen John the Baptist's head drop into a bucket in the front
stalls, nor seen the Egyptian army paddle through a three-foot Nile,
then you are a seriously deprived person, let me tell you.
Frank's successor brought with him one of the best contact books in
the business.
And it's thanks to the professional relationships he had already
established at Welsh National Opera with people like Peter Stein that
Brian McMaster has lured some of the most renowned directorial talents
to Scotland.
Peter Sellars, Robert Lepage, Robert Wilson, and now Luc Bondy have
all joined a spectacularly glittery cast list. And all have provided the
kind of performances the memory of which can still give you a warm glow
many months later.
Stein, never a man to think small, with his 400 strong Julius Caesar
at Ingliston (noises off courtesy of British Airways). Lepage with his
astonishing Bluebeard and Erwartung, Sellars's Persians, The Hour We
Knew Nothing of Each Other from Bondy last year, and Wilson's
mesmerising production of Dr Faustus Lights the Lights.
And always, always these major dramatic highlights from the official
Festival interspersed with unexpected triumphs from the Fringe, many of
them celebrating indigenous UK talents but also with the ability to pull
special foreign delights from the hat like the Moscow Theatre's Hamlet
and the Georgians' Midsummer Night's Dream at the Assembly Rooms.
Meanwhile, the rehoused Traverse does nothing to damage its reputation
as the most consistent nurturer of new playwright talent in Scotland if
not in Britain.
And then there is Senor Demarco. Ricky, it is said, is a one-man
Festival and Fringe. Over the years he has brought a quite astonishing
array of drama to his many and varied venues, not least, over the last
few years, from the former Yugoslavia. His unquenchable enthusiasm for
innovation, his spectacular flirtations with bankruptcy, his unrivalled
flair for self-publi city, and his remarkable energy would make him a
national institution but for the fact that would imply he was in danger
of joining the establishment.
Let me offer a small flavour of the Demarco experience. We are on
Inchcolm Island where Ricky is staging a kind of peripatetic Macbeth,
the audience having been ferried over and invited to follow the thesps
around a succession of natural stages around the ruins.
But on this night there is a special guest. He is Richard Luce,
erstwhile Minister for the Arts, who has been persuaded by Ricky that
this experience qualifies as unmissable. Mr Luce, who has a bad back, is
swaddled in a Demarco-issue grey blanket and assaulted by a stiff wind
off the firth. After act two, I surreptitiously examine the ministerial
features. The eyes appear half closed. Is he moved beyond words? Is he
committing this splendid production to memory. Maybe. My bet is he was
praying for deliverance in the shape of another ferry.
But it was, as it always is with Ricky, a splendidly eccentric
adventure.
Sometimes of course you don't need the chill of an Edinburgh breeze to
lift the hairs on the back of your neck. Sometimes you need only sit in
the Queen's Hall of a morning, or the Usher Hall at night. No conductor
of renown is missing from the cast list of the Edinburgh International
Festival over its two score and nine years, and similarly there have
been performances from orchestras which live with their audiences for
the rest of their lives.
It seems iniquitous to pull one performance from that span of talent
but for sheer emotion it would be difficult to top the performance of
the orchestra we now know as the St Petersburg Philarmonic the evening
they played their hearts out not knowing what was the result of the
revolution which had overtaken their city since they had begun their
journey. Yet they are an orchestra who can always reduce an audience to
eerie silence by the sheer power of their emotion playing.
I remember hearing them later at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. And
given the historical resonances of the piece the St Petersburg playing
the Leningrad Symphony was a real show-stoppper.
Then again perhaps the audiences are more reverential than the
artistes over such matters. I found myself seated beside Rafael de
Burgos at lunch on the same day he was conducting an important concert.
''Tell me, maestro,'' I burble, ''how do you prepare for such an
event?'' ''Well, first I have a very good lunch, with a bottle of very
good red wine. Then I fall asleep. Then I wake up and go to the hall!''
There was a time when dance threatened to be a slightly impoverished
relation at the Festival. Now, with the help of the magnificently
refurbished Festival Theatre, it has moved centre stage. Mark Morris,
Bill T Jones, and Pina Bausch have all developed ongoing relationships
with the Festival and are all back this year as is Miami City Ballet.
But once you have negotiated the Fringe programme with its 900-plus
offerings, once you have induced apoplexy at the bank by booking up your
official treats, do not ever think of taking time off for good
behaviour.
For this is the year the Book Festival is back with the literary
glitterati, not even to mention the less cerebral glories of the
Spiegeltent. There is the venerable Film Festival with its usual
seductive array there to encourage the ultimate in cultural decadence .
. . going to the movies during the day. Just thinking about it ought to
induce premature exhaustion. Instead there's the supressed excitement of
anticipation, the wonderful certainty that arriving in Edinburgh in
August is even better than travelling hopefully.
More than 20 years ago, as a fledgling festival groupie, a friend and
I clambered up to the cheapest available seats in the Assembly Hall. We
were there to see a young actor called Ian McKellen play Edward II. I
think the current parliamentary parlance for our state when we emerged
is ''gobsmacked''.
And it's been a rare year since when something somewhere in that three
weeks hasn't had the same effect.
I mentioned the anticipatory pleasure of spotting your first Festival
unicyclist.  There is too the despairing sight of the fire-eaters,
jugglers, and itinerant apostles of Shiatsu massage folding their tents
as the circus leaves town. Happily that awful fate is a whole glorious
month distant. Enjoy.

Mark Morris, choreographer of the Mark Morris Dance Group, tells The
Herald what are the top three events on his Festival agenda. The Mark
Morris Dance Group is performing a Mixed Bill, King's Theatre, Aug
14-16, 8pm; and The Hard Nut, Edinburgh Festival Theatre, Aug 29-Sept 2,
7.30pm.
1. The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, Kirov Opera, Edinburgh
Festival Theatre: I see as many things as I possibly can when I'm in
Edinburgh, though I miss things when I'm performing which drives me
crazy. I saw the Kirov Opera doing Sadko recently in New York and I
loved it so much that I really want to see this one.
2. Schubert Die schone Mullerin, Peter Schreier and Andras Schiff,
Usher Hall: I'm dying to see this one, because I like Schubert and I'm a
big fan of those two gentlemen.
3. Folk Songs of North-east Scotland, Edinburgh Festival Theatre: I'd
like to catch a couple of hours of the 48 hours' worth of Scottish
folk-songs it looks like they'll be performing. And the other thing I
like to do is have a little drink and wander the streets watching the
fireworks.

Srinagar
A LEADING Kashmiri separatist group appealed to militants today to
free immediately five Westerners held hostage in the Himalayan region
for a month.
Muhammad Shafi Misgar of the pro-independence Jammu and Kashmir
Liberation Front (JKLF) said during Friday prayers at Srinagar's
Hazratbal shrine that the abduction of the tourists by Al-Faran
militants was against the teaching of Islam.
Misgar appealed to the shadowy Al Faran holding the tourists, saying
the abductions had a negative impact on the five-year-old rebellion
against New Delhi.
''Whatever be the factors behind the kidnappings of the hostages, its
negative impact on our movement cannot be ignored,'' Misgar said.
''We, therefore, appeal to the kidnappers in the name of humanity, and
in these days when we are celebrating the birthday of Prophet Muhammed,
to release the Western tourists unharmed immediately.
''If they are not released on the occasion of Prophet's birthday, it
will be construed as going against the teachings of the holy Prophet,''
he said.
Muslims in the troubled Kashmir valley will celebrate Prophet's
birthday on August 10.
Britons Paul Wells and Keith Mangan, an American, a German, and a
Norwegian were abducted last month by Al-Faran while on trekking
holidays near Pahalgam, 55 miles from the state summer capital Srinagar.
Earlier the All Party Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, which groups some
30 Kashmiri religious, social, and political parties, had condemned the
abductions and appealed for the release of the hostages.--Reuter.

Phnom Penh
WARREN CHRISTOPHER became the first US secretary of state to visit
Cambodia in four decades today on a trip that aimed to overcome
America's bitter war legacy in South-east Asia.
Christopher, on a one-day visit, hailed Cambodia's fledgling democracy
and the United Nations peacekeeping mission that helped bring it about,
one of the few recent successes for the embattled international body.
''I am here to salute the progress the Cambodian people have made,
with dignity and courage, towards peace and freedom,'' Christopher said
on arrival.
''I am here to underscore the commitment of the United States to
support the democratic path you have chosen. And I am here to urge you
to consolidate the institutions of democracy as you prepare for your
next round of elections,'' he added.
Later Christopher applauded Cambodia's efforts to rebuild its
shattered society after more than two decades of civil war and genocide,
but he warned that democracy was still fragile.
''There have been many moving transformations in this world since the
Cold War ended, but I think no new democracy has had to overcome greater
devastation, face greater problems than the new democracy here in
Cambodia,'' he said. ''Few have been burdened by such grim memories of
genocide and terror.''
However Christopher also stressed that ''the survival of Cambodian
democracy cannot be taken for granted'' and urged that the international
community go beyond the massive humanitarian investment it has made in
Cambodia over the past decade.
The United States bombed Cambodia in the early 1970s during the
Vietnam War but officials said this history was not raised in
Christopher's meetings.
The country has also been scarred by the communist Khmer Regime
regime, which is blamed for one million deaths when it ruled Cambodia in
1975-1978, as well as 20 years of civil war.
A US-backed peace agreement signed in 1991 led to UN-sponsored
elections in 1993 and the current government, in which leaders of the
two non-communist factions, Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, serve
as co-prime ministers.
Fighting continues between the government and the Khmer Rouge but US
officials said the guerrillas have no more than 10,000 members and are
''a minimal threat to overall stability''.
Christopher said the possibility of prosecuting Khmer Rouge leaders
for crimes against humanity, committed during their 1970s reign of
terror, was still a worthwhile objective.
Christopher toured the former Khmer Rouge prison in Phnom Penh, and
emerged ashen-faced to remark: ''Man's inhumanity to man. It's hard to
conceive the whole country turned on itself.''
As he stood in a former torture cell at the genocide museum where more
than 20,000 men, women, and children were brutally interrogated and then
executed for so-called counter-revolutionary crimes, Christopher said:
''It's horrible, it's beyond belief.''--Reuter.

Paris
FRANCE and Australia traded warnings of fresh economic retaliation
today in a worsening row over French plans to resume nuclear weapons
tests in the South Pacific as an international outcry against the blasts
widened.
Two days before the 50th anniversary of the US atom bombing of the
Japanese city of Hiroshima, Japan's Parliament protested against French
and Chinese nuclear tests.
And non-government organisations such as the World Wide Fund for
Nature, the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres, and the huge
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions joined a chorus urging
French President Jacques Chirac to back down.
Tension was highest between Paris and Canberra, where both governments
said they were prepared to step up a largely symbolic mini-trade war
over Chirac's plans for seven or eight underground tests in French
Polynesia from September to May.
''We will respond to reprisals with other measures with calmness but
with determination,'' said French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette.
''We want to make known to the Australian Government that if they cross
the borderline, there will be no limits.''
Earlier, Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said Canberra might
also step up tit-for-tat moves, including in defence acquisition.
Australia has banned a French defence firm from bidding for a contract
worth up to #493m and one state banned French firms from its #6400m
electricity privatisation programme.
Paris responded by withdrawing its envoy from Canberra and threatening
economic sanctions against Australian coal and uranium contracts worth

''We have a few difficult months to get over,'' French European
Affairs Minister Michel Barnier said, urging restraint.
''These tests will be done as rapidly as possible, before the end of
May 1996 . . . The future of these relations (with Australia) is much
longer than the next six months,'' he said.
In Tokyo, the Japanese Parliament said French and Chinese nuclear
tests both threatened the environment and treaties designed to curtail
nuclear weapons. It was the first time an anti-nuclear resolution named
specific nations.
The US nuclear bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6,
1945, killed 140,000 people on impact. The second bomb on Nagasaki three
days later killed 70,000 on impact.
De Charette reaffirmed French readiness to sign a total worldwide test
ban next year after the final tests at the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls
which he said represented no danger to people, animals, or the
environment.
However Greenpeace said more than 70 scientists had appealed to Chirac
to allow a study of the atolls before the tests to check French
assertions that previous tests had done no ecological damage.
The Swiss-based World Wide Fund for Nature said the blasts could
affect the lives of people, deep-sea and coral atoll ecosystems, marine
life, and birds.
In Brussels, Medecins Sans Frontieres said it was alarmed by France's
''lack of concern'' about the medical risks.
The ICFTU, which represents 127 million workers in 135 countries, said
it would call on unions to contact their French embassies and ask their
governments to take a clear stand against the French plans.--Reuter.
