THE connection between the Battle of Solferino in 1859 and a Red Cross
cafe in the grounds of a Glasgow hospital may not be immediately
apparent.
For those in quest of knowledge along with their cup of tea, however,
a laminated poster in the cafe helpfully explains that it was the
carnage of the engagement in the second War of Italian Independence that
led to the creation of the International Red Cross.
Now, having won important battles of its own for humanitarian
principles, the movement has had to concede defeat in a local skirmish
with a more powerful adversary.
The Glasgow branch of the Red Cross has been beaten in its bid to
retain its cafe at the Southern General Hospital by the massed forces of
Big Mac -- McDonald's Restaurants Limited. Subject to contractual
negotiations, a 60-seat burger restaurant will be operating beside the
surgical wards by June.
The decision by the NHS trust running the hospital to open a fast-food
outlet at an institution dedicated to health has sparked controversy.
However, the trust is unrepentant.
When a five-year lease on the premises expired, it says, the district
valuer confirmed that a McDonald's bid offered ''the best guaranteed
minimum rent opportunity''.
Mr Robert Calderwood, chief executive of the trust, insists that the
introduction of McDonald's will improve the range of catering facilities
at the hospital, which include a staff restaurant and WRVS snack bars.
In a prepared statement, he says: ''The aim was to maximise the
facilities for staff, patients, and visitors -- both in the quality of
service offered and the commercial return.''
The bottom line, of course, is commercial return. Unfortunately,
neither the NHS trust nor McDonald's is prepared to divulge how much the
hospital is likely to benefit from the new deal. Nor is Mr Calderwood
inclined to discuss the matter with the media.
His spokesman said: ''Mr Calderwood's view is that since this is a
purely commercial transaction, it would not be appropriate for him to be
interviewed.''
The spokesman added, however, that the trust was satisfied that
McDonald's meals -- eaten in the context of a balanced diet -- were
perfectly healthy.
''Obviously if I were to eat hamburgers seven days a week that would
not be very sensible,'' he said. ''But then neither would eating fish
and chips every day.''
The hospital's chief dietician Tracy Nairn takes a similar view. She
said: ''This type of food would pose a problem only to those who became
dependent on it. As part of a balanced diet, it is not really of concern
to us.''
The Greater Glasgow Health Board says it is satisfied that a choice of
foods, including healthy options, is available at the hospital.
McDonald's is delighted to be of service in a new location. Mr Robert
Parker, a spokesman for the company in Manchester, stressed it has
always endeavoured to ensure its meals are safe, healthy, and
nutritious. The company has been operating an outlet at Guy's Hospital
in London successfully for more than a year, and Mr Parker hopes
visitors to the Southern General will be equally appreciative.
Thus everybody is satisfied with the new deal -- with the exception of
prospective customers who have not been consulted in the matter. A
random opinion poll of diners in the Red Cross cafe last week found
nobody in favour of the change.
Mr Alex Johnston, a retired bricklayer from Cambuslang, expressed the
prevailing view: ''I don't agree with it whatsoever. Money comes before
health -- that's what it's coming to. They're getting their values all
wrong. If there's a wee place opens up and does well, the big men move
in. It's as simple as that.''
His wife Lily agreed: ''I think it's a shame the Red Cross have to
leave. It's cosy in here, not like McDonald's. Here you're among your
own kind. They should leave the place the way it is.''
The couple, who had been visiting a relative in the hospital every day
for six weeks, doubted if they could afford the higher prices at
McDonald's.
''I never go into McDonald's, it's too fast for me,'' confided Liz
McArthur, a sprightly 80-year-old from Crookston. ''All that rushing
about for hamburgers, it's not for me. I like it here, where you can
have good old home-made food and a wee chat.''
The customers are not the only ones to feel a sense of loss. Over the
years, the cafe has generated thousands of pounds for Red Cross
community services, including crisis care and therapy. Its five
full-time staff and 17 volunteers now face redundancy, as the Red Cross
has no other sites at present to employ them.
Mrs Agnes McLelland, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross, is diplomatic
about the loss. She says: ''Our lease had reached its natural conclusion
and we tendered for a new one. Obviously we're disappointed we were not
successful but we've always had a good working relationship with the
hospital and there's no bad feeling between us. It's just one of those
things, I suppose.''
The cafe is far from being a haute cuisine establishment but the
popular sentiment is that it is familiar and friendly, offering a range
of home-cooked foods at reasonable prices. It is a comforting place for
people visiting sick friends and relatives and is popular with junior
medical staff. On average, it attracts 500 customers a day.
The brash American approach of McDonald's city centre outlet on Argyle
Street is a stark contrast. Instead of kindly ladies with Red Cross
lapel badges, youths in red and grey striped shirts serve beef, chicken,
and fish burgers to a largely teenage clientele.
The ethos of the Red Cross cafe is summed up by a sign at the counter,
which says in part: ''We cannot cater for you all, our kitchen area is
far too small; please come in and feel at ease, let us see if we can
please.''
A sign at McDonald's declares: ''No Loitering. Minimum charge per
person #1 at the management's discretion.''
While the cafe's most expensive dish is steak pie and chips for #1.90,
a Big Mac with a small portion of ''fries'' costs #2.36. Tea and coffee
at McDonald's are double the price of the Red Cross cafe's beverages.
The NHS trust points out that the staff restaurant, run by in-house
caterers, is open to hospital visitors. However, few members of the
public appear to be aware of this, and there is only one small sign
indicating the restaurant is behind the chaplaincy. One morning this
week, the Red Cross cafe had 17 customers; the visitors' section of the
staff restaurant had none.
At the entrance to the hospital management offices there is a larger
sign declaring: ''Continuing the tradition of developing NHS services
for the community.''
In this case, the impression is that a community tradition has been
sacrificed by NHS managers with a taste for Big Mac budgets.

THE smiles say it all, and the great resurrection shuffle moves on to
Twickenham. Now Gavin Hastings and his happy band of brothers can think
the hitherto unthinkable, and the Grand Slam showdown against England is
a reality.
Six weeks ago, with the oppressive psychological baggage of nine games
without a win threatening to drain the lifeblood from the entire
Scottish camp, the Scots beat Canada. With hindsight that win stands as
a sporting metaphor for the second coming.
Since then the Scots have never looked back. Ireland were dispatched
with workmanlike efficiency at Murrayfield and then came France in
Paris. The Scots played with passion and, at times, technical brilliance
to lay low the 26-year hoodoo of no wins on French soil.
Wales at the weekend represented, in manager Duncan Paterson's phrase,
the semi-final. Beaten semi-finalists, he observed, were pretty soon
forgotten. There is little chance of this Scotland side being easily
forgotten now.
The semi-final hurdle has been cleared and on Saturday week the Scots
-- 50-1 championship outsiders in January -- are no longer travelling
more in hope than expectation.
Forget all that has gone before. At Twickenham on March 18 for 80
minutes it will be 15 of Scotland's finest versus Will Carling's
juggernaut in white. England will, of course, be favourites, just as
they were on March 17, 1990, when they were sent hameward tae think
again by David Sole and his Grand Slam Scots.
But once again, this will be a one-off encounter of cup final
intensity as Scotland seek to secure only the fourth Grand Slam in the
history of the Scottish game.
In the immediate aftermath of Saturday's 26-13 win over Wales, it was
a point conceded by Paterson. ''Sure, we'll be going down as underdogs
but that does us no harm. We love it,'' he declared with a twinkle in
his eye.
This Scotland side has risen to every challenge that has been laid in
front of them. Twenty-six years without a sniff of victory in France was
a pretty formidable statistic. Here is another. Since the war Scotland
have played England 24 times at Twickenham. In that time they have won
only twice. They have drawn four times and seen their expectations
dashed on no less than 18 occasions.
That is the stark reality of the situation but, so often this season,
Hastings and his men have so defied the conventions of what poses for
reality that we are ready to believe almost anything.
Certainly the downcast Welsh skipper Ieuan Evans was more than willing
to believe that the Scots can go to Twickenham and realise the
impossible dream. After Saturday's game he declared: ''Yes, of course
the Scots have got a chance. If they get the English going as they did
against us today with people running from deep then they have a very
good chance indeed.
''Once they start on a roll with the likes of Peter Wright and Rob
Wainwright carrying the ball so well in close quarter situations then I
think they have a very good chance.'' But he warned: ''I don't think
they can afford to give England a lead like they did with us and against
France a fortnight ago. I don't think they can afford to do that against
England,'' said Evans.
Scotland coach Dougie Morgan, who has survived intact the maelstrom of
criticism which was his unhappy lot during the darks days of defeat, was
well pleased with his side's performance on Saturday.
''It was a tremendous performance in the first half. We played some
great rugby.'' And he added ironically: ''We're getting quite good at
giving sides a start and then coming back. But all credit to the boys
for the way they got stuck in. It would have been nice to have finished
the second half with another couple of scores but I don't think we can
take anything away from the players. It was a great performance and a
great result.''
Hastings, who will surely be awarded the Order of the Thistle but who
probably deserves to be beatified for the role that he has played in the
revival of Scottish fortunes, was, he said with massive understatement,
just delighted.
''Losing a try like early on was a big blow but it shows the character
of the team that we came back as we did. We didn't quite get it together
again as I would have hoped in the second half but all credit to Wales.
They are no push-overs and just because we managed to get a win today
doesn't take anything away from them''
The Scottish captain was asked if he had a message for Will Carling.
Hastings replied curtly that he would be thinking and talking about
England only in the week ahead.
He was asked if, at Christmas time, he could have foreseen this great
revival in Scottish fortunes. This time he was more forthcoming. ''Just
like two years ago I said that if we weren't going down to Twickenham
for the last game of the season with a chance at the Triple Crown then I
would have been disappointed. Now we've gone one stage further and we're
going down for the Grand Slam.''
And, with reference to the trials and tribulations suffered by the
coaches, Hastings added: ''I'm delighted with the results that we have
achieved in the last few games but these things don't just happen.
''An awful lot of hard work has gone into what we have achieved, not
least from the guys sitting alongside me and I'm delighted for Dougie
Morgan. He has gone through a lot and he has good reason to have a smile
on his face today.''
The coach explained just what this hard work had entailed. ''First and
foremost you have to get control of set-piece, so obviously we have put
in lot of work on lineout and scrummage.
''Thereafter, it is down to broken-play and success there is dependent
on decision-making. Players absolutely have to make the right decisions
in contact situations. They have to decide whether to go to ground or to
play the ball out of contact. Now we're getting the balance right.''
At the start of the season Morgan's jaiket, as they saw in these
parts, may well have been on a shoogly nail. Taxi for Morgan, was the
cruel cry which went up in some quarters, indicating that his departure
was imminent. On Saturday the cab was despatched back to the rank and
the Twickenham limousine sat ticking over at the Murrayfield portals.

ROY Aitken, Aberdeen's caretaker-manager, saw his side drop deeper
into danger after having lost 2-0 to Celtic, and then admitted: ''The
players in the dressing room are bewildered over some of the decisions
in the game.''
The one-time Celtic captain was obviously as unhappy as his Pittodrie
players about the penalty decision which gave the Parkhead men a
half-time lead. When Pierre Van Hooydonk went down after a challenge
from Brian Irvine four minutes before the interval, the Dutchman picked
himself up, dusted himself down, and scored from the spot.
But angry Aberdeen players claimed that referee Andrew Waddell had
over-reacted. And Aitken himself said: ''I cannot say too much in case I
am pulled up in front of the bigwigs. But there is no doubt that we were
beaten by decisions which I cannot comment on, and decisions which I did
not understand.
''I am not saying that the breaks went against us. I am saying that we
were beaten by decisions I cannot comment on.''
When asked if he was referring to the penalty award, Aitken answered:
''Were there not other penalty decisions in the game? I have players in
the dressing room who are bewildered by what has gone on.''
Aberdeen complaints also centered on a second-half incident when
Irvine was barged off the ball by Willie Falconer in the Celtic penalty
box. Their claims were waved aside by the referee.
Aberdeen now are five points clear of bottom-club Partick Thistle and
three adrift of Falkirk. But Thistle have three games in hand, while
Falkirk have played one less.
This weekend the Pittodrie men go to Firhill for a crunch relegation
clash, and Aitken declared: ''We will spend the week preparing for that.
We have to get ourselves right.''
For Celtic, meanwhile, the script was different. Van Hooydonk, who
added a second goal before the end, claimed: ''People will think that I
dived -- but I didn't. The player came in behind me and gave me a little
push.
''You have to remember that the referee was only two or three metres
away and there was no-one in his line of vision. The referee is not
blind, you know.
''I don't want to say any more. The last time this happened, against
Kilmarnock, there was too much said.''
Then the striker found himself embroiled in a row with Killie players
--yesterday he was trying to avoid that.
For manager Tommy Burns it was a result which ended a dreary league
run, gave his side a win, and pushed them closer to Motherwell and Hibs
in the race for a European place.
''I am delighted to get the win and happy at the performances of
several of the players,'' he said. ''Pierre was touch and go but he
wanted to play, and we went with him on that.''
On the reasons for leaving out John Collins -- the second big-name
player to be axed by Burns this year -- the manager explained: ''I felt
John had been off the boil for the past month and thought it was the
right time to bring Paul McStay back into that central-midfield
position.
''We also need someone in wide areas and Brian McLaughlin has been
doing that for us, and so John was on the bench for a spell today.''

Celtic 2, Aberdeen 0
ABERDEEN plunged still deeper into crisis yesterday. And the penalty
decision which sent them towards yet another defeat underlined just how
the breaks can go against a struggling team.
The award by referee Andrew Waddell -- who seems to strut happily hand
in hand with controversy -- was a soft one. It looked that way when it
was given, and the feeling was endorsed by television replays.
Giant Dutchman Pierre Van Hooydonk was presumed to be the victim of a
push in the back from Brian Irvine. Whatever anyone else thought,
Waddell gave the penalty and the Dutchman scored.
Then, late in the game, the #1.2m buy from Holland added a second to
take Waddell partially off the hook.
These goals ended a run of four games without a win for Celtic in the
premier division, and it was only their third in their past 21 league
games.
The goals also emphasised the plight the Pittodrie team now find
themselves in.
You must presume that when the television planners decided on this
game for a live showing, they expected a meaningful clash between two
major teams.
Instead they found themselves with two starring clubs who have known
better times scrapping it out in front of just more than 20,000 fans --
a far cry indeed from the momentous clashes of the not-so-distant past.
This was Celtic's lowest gate of the season. And it was close to 9000
down on the first time the two clubs met at Hampden in their first
premier meeting of the season.
It was sad to see the rows of empty seats, and to realise that the
major interest in the outcome was not the title, but only how far
Aberdeen would become embroiled in the relegation struggle.
That penalty, when it arrived, stemmed a rising tide of boos and jeers
from the unhappy fans.
Paul McStay had started the game, and as skipper at that. This time it
was the turn of international colleague John Collins to sit things out
with a place on the substitutes' bench.
It was Celtic who pushed forward most at the start of the game, but
somehow they were unable to make things happen at that early stage. In
31 minutes, however, keeper Michael Watt had to hurl himself along his
line to smother a drive from Tosh McKinlay. Soon afterwards, Watt raced
from his line to block a shot from Phil O'Donnell.
Then came the controversial penalty four minutes before half-time. Van
Hooydonk scored, and Aberdeen perhaps realised that nothing was going
right for them.
They might have changed things in the second half as they tried to
come back -- but they failed.
In 54 minutes, youngster Stephen Glass beat Tommy Boyd out on the
left, and then whipped a cross over the face of the goal. Joe Miller
reached it first and smacked a header against the face of the bar.
There was another chance just three minutes later when Billy Dodds
crossed from the right. Eoin Jess rose to challenge Pat Bonner, the
keeper dropped the ball, and Boyd hooked it away just short of the line.
Then in 71 minutes, Bonner redeemed himself with a world-class save.
Duncan Shearer had replaced Jess, and when Stephen Wright crossed from
the right, the powerful striker sent in a header which Bonner stopped
with his legs on the goal-line.
By now, too, John Collins had replaced Brian McLaughlin after 60
minutes to add some more urgency to Celtic's play.
Twelve minutes from the end, it was McKinlay who made ground down the
left and then set up a chance for the second decisive goal. His cross
drifted way over to the far post, and Van Hooydonk was there
unchallenged to touch a header into the net.
Although Billy Dodds did have the ball in the net for Aberdeen four
minutes later, that was disallowed for offside as if to sum up
Aberdeen's afternoon.
Beforehand, manager Roy Aitken had hoped that the presence of the
television cameras would lift his players, just as it did three weeks
ago when he took over as caretaker for the first time in the clash with
Rangers at Pittodrie.
Then the players had responded to the challenge and handed the new man
a victory. Yesterday they were unable to do it. The penalty blow
certainly dented whatever confidence they may have left.
Clearly Aitken has problems. Just as clearly, they have not been of
his making.
Aberdeen are playing as if they are a team doomed to face at least a
play-off in any attempt to stay in the top division.
They have been offered a #5000-a-man bonus to stay up. Yesterday there
were few signs that, even with that kind of cash on offer, the players
have the ability and the commitment to pull themselves clear of the
danger zone they have now lived in for too long.

PETER McColgan, who won the Cupar six-mile race on Saturday, has given
up his UK citizenship and declared for the Republic of Ireland, writes
Doug Gillon.
McColgan, who ran the steeplechase for Northern Ireland in the 1986
Commonwealth Games, and for Britain in the 1991 world championships, ran
in Eire's world cross-country trial last weekend.
''I may be selected for the worlds at Durham by the Republic, as I'm
entitled to do, having been born in the North,'' he said yesterday. ''It
is mainly because Ireland's selection for endurance events is much
better than Britain's.
''All the best guys run in their trials, and you know where you are,
instead of being allowed to sit them out, and getting selected anyway,
as happens in Britain.
''I'm thinking of the 10,000 metres, or possibly even the marathon at
the Olympics in Atlanta. I suppose I could be running for Eire while Liz
is competing for Britain.''
Peter, who clocked 27min 51sec, was within 20sec of Allister Hutton's
course record in freezing conditions at Cupar, with wife Liz winning the
women's race, twentieth overall, in 30-34.
''I ran 29-39 three years ago on that course, after a week's rest,''
said Liz. ''Last week we came home from Florida, because I could not get
into the race I wanted to run there. Instead, on Sunday, I did a 20-mile
time trial, from Errol to Carnoustie. I'm not saying how fast, but it
was a personal best by several minutes.
''Peter and my dad were out on the road, with water bottles, getting
me used to drinking again for the marathon. I also trained hard during
the week, so I'm pretty pleased with the time. It was freezing. I ran in
shorts, and it was a real shock after Florida.''
Liz races the London Marathon on April 2, but added: ''I'm running a
half marathon in Lisbon next weekend, against Tecla Loroupe, the New
York Marathon winner.'' Results:
1, P McColgan (DHH) 27min 51sec; 2, S Weir (BT Pitreavie) 28-12; 3, D
Ross (Leslie Deans RC) 28-20. Veteran -- R Bell (DHH) 30-16. Teams -- 1,
Dundee Hawkhill 16pt; 2, Leslie Deans RC 27; 3, Fife 46. Women -- 1, E

Pitreavie (36.02). Veteran -- M McLaren (Fife) 36-36. Team -- Fife

* BRITISH world champion Colin Jackson set an Australian all-comers'
record of 13.32sec to win the 110m hurdles at the Australian national
titles in Sydney yesterday.
The 28-year-old Welshman, who holds the world record for the event at
12.91sec, defied wet and blustery conditions at the Homebush Stadium to
edge out Australian Kyle Vander-Kuyp, with another Briton, Paul Gray,
finishing third.
Canadian Mark McKoy set the previous record of 13.37sec at the 1982
Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, a time equalled by Jackson in Melbourne
last month.

SKYE Camanachd look set to take action which could lead to their
Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup fourth-round tie against Oban Camanachd being
halted. The club have indicated that they could go as far as taking
legal steps to prevent the match being played this Saturday.
The island side are up in arms following the second postponement of
the tie on Saturday. Severe weather conditions in Oban and Portree meant
that both sides' home pitches were unplayable, as was the third choice,
Spean Bridge, which had been placed on standby.
In the interim, however, association fixtures secretary John Willie
Campbell had taken steps to have the tie transferred to Inverness, where
the game's top venue, the Bught Park, had become available and was
playable.
Skye Camanachd have demanded a full explanation from the Camanachd
Association. Skye's view is that the game should not have been called
off until Saturday morning, as had been indicated in the fixture list.
They feel that having organised players to play at any venue necessary,
including bringing at least one player home from Edinburgh, the call-off
on Friday evening was at best unnecessary.
Camanachd Association president Duncan Cameron, who agreed the match
was off on Friday night without apparently knowing that Inverness had
been identified as a possible venue, said the ball is now firmly in
Skye's court. He said: ''Skye have asked us for an explanation of the
circumstances and we will do that as soon as possible, but in the
meantime the match has to be re-scheduled for this weekend, and it is up
to Skye what they do now.''
Skye are furious and a club source said that they were prepared to
''go the whole way on this one.'' Results:
Marine Harvest League. Division 2 -- St Andrews University 1, Tayforth
17. Division 3 -- Fort William 1, Boleskine 1; Glenurquhart 6, Aberdeen
University 2. Valerie Fraser Cup. First round -- Lochcarron 1, Kilmallie

IN HIS post-round winner's interview, Nick Faldo did a fair imitation
of Forrest Gump and said: ''Life is like a box of chocolates, you never
know what you're going to get.''
That vacuous comment was somewhat apt yesterday as Faldo went through
several extremes of emotion and expectation over the final hole of the
Doral Open in Miami, Florida, a tournament he would win in improbable
fashion.
Faldo had a one-stroke lead over Greg Norman at the eighteenth tee.
His drive ended up just inches into the water that lines the left side
of the fairway. He then hit a magnificent No.3-wood third shot that
landed just 25 feet from the cup on the narrow final green.
He two-putted for bogey, and resigned himself to a play-off with
Norman, at best. But Norman hit his second shot to the par 4 into the
lake. Said Faldo: ''I was thinking about a play-off, then all of a
sudden there was a quick groan, and someone said Greg was in the water.
Then the next thing I know, Peter Jacobsen had a 50 foot putt to tie
with me.
''Well, the way things have been going for him this year, I figured
he'd probably make it.''
Jacobsen missed, but not by much, and Faldo had the victory, having
shot a 69 to do it. Norman and Jacobsen, who began the day as
co-leaders, tied at 15 under par for second place.
Faldo spent a month on the West Coast learning how to putt on fast
American greens, with little visible success until now, missing the cut
in his last tournament after a disasterous mid-round switch from
cross-handed to conventional putting.
He never stopped working on the pratice greens, though, and, finally,
his hard work paid off. Faldo made 22 birdies at Doral this week, moving
into contention for an American title for the first time in more than a
year and a half. His win was just the second regular US tour victory,
having last won 11 years ago in 1984 at the Heritage Classic. He also,
of course, won the 1989 and 1990 Masters tournaments. Final aggregaetes
(American unless otherweise stated):

SEPP fell ill and had to jet home and old Joao was having a lie-down.
Strange the effect an invitation to watch a premier division match can
have on a person.
Joao Havelange, president of the world (well, actually just FIFA, but
the Brazilian octogenarian may think his powers are truly global) and
his general secretary were in Scotland, at the luxurious Turnberry
Hotel, to attend the 109th sitting of the International Football
Association Board, the group that can tinker with the laws of the game.
They met on Saturday afternoon around the time other footballing
people were at matches, but then again, if you had an excuse not to go
to a game, you might make use of it, given the qaulity of the stuff
presented in the premier division most weekends. It was probably the
fear of being asked to catch the second half of one of the matches that
made poor Sepp fevered and his gaffer feel suddenly fatigued.
So there you have it. These mighty rulers of the world game, who hand
down edicts that can have an effect on all of us, couldn't take in a
match and left Jim Farry and representatives of the English, Welsh, and
Irish associations, and also FIFA assistant secretary Michel
Zen-Ruffinen, to talk on the consequences of the meeting.
Crucial matters such as advertising on the field of play through to
logos cut or painted on the turf or displayed on goalposts -- which
seems to me to be a good idea, since the keepers would have something to
read between saves -- FIFA'S laws of the game booklet which is to become
more colourful and interesting to read, and even the ball (yes, the
ball) were discussed.
Now, I don't know how long these discussions took, but it can't be
particularly time-consuming to talk about the ball. It's round, and it
has air in it. And you kick it.
After that, there's not much more to be said unless, of course, you
wish to discuss technical processes required to be undertaken before
FIFA will approve your balls; or it may have been there was a proposal
for inserting guidance systems inside the orbs, something that would be
of particular interest to Celtic's strikers.
However, to be fair to the administrators -- although it beats me why
we should -- they did mull over some matters of genuine significance.
They agreed that from the start of next season teams will be allowed
three substitutes as opposed to two and a keeper, and most managers will
probably nominate three outfield players, which could have a positive
effect on matches.
Another interesting change concerns law 11, and the board considered a
Scottish proposal on offside. As in the World Cup finals, being in an
offside position will not be an offence in itself, and only those
players interfering with play or attempting to gain an advantage at the
time the ball is touched by a team-mate will be deemed offside.
In law 12 the word ''intention'' has been removed from the opening
line on fouls and misconduct, which used to read: ''Any player who
intentionally commits any of the following nine offences . . . ''
This means referees do not need to make instant judgments as to
whether or not they believe a player has fouled intentionally or
otherwise.
Michel Zen-Ruffinen said that modern technology will not be introduced
to assist referees, either by relying on replays to get decisions
correct or having the referee wired up so he can communicate with other
officials. FIFA want the referee to remain the only arbiter, and
Zen-Ruffinen said: ''I don't see technology being used to any great
degree in our sport in the near future. In fact, not even in 10 years.''
FIFA have written to the German association, telling them it was wrong
to allow a replay of a Bundeslige match between Bayern Munich and
Nuremberg after video evidence showed Bayern were awarded a goal that
shouldn't have been allowed.
Time-outs were also discussed, and these will be experimented with,
probably in an under-17 or under-20 competition. The Olympics in Atlanta
could be chosen as the event, said Zen-Ruffinen, but he rejected the
notion that time-outs would only fragment the play and detain people
longer than would be necessary.
Perhaps if he had gone to Kilmarnock's match against Dundee United he
would have realised that in our climate it would be cruelty in the
extreme to ask supporters to sit shivering while a manager makes the
letter ''T'' by placing a palm against the tops of the fingers of his
other hand.
There is too much talking and not enough action in football, and
anything that interferes with the flow of games shoud be resisted and
clubs should be telling these people of FIFA who can't go to matches
that they should stick to checking out the world's best hotels and
eating places.
Leave the playing of the game to those who know, those who watch
regularly and who can see that continous tinkering with the laws does
not necessarily mean an improved product.
Altering laws won't create talented footballers. Altering priorites,
like spending all of the money on coaching and equipment for the
under-privileged will, and if either Sepp or poor old worn-out Joao --
must be all that travelling and high living -- had shown face, they
would have been told, not that it would have made the slightest
difference.
If it is getting to either of them, perhaps they should experiment
with time-outs. I think a time-out of about 20 years ought to do it,
gentlemen.

By JIM REYNOLDS in Atlantic City
GLASGOW'S Gary Jacobs, the former undefeated European welterweight
champion, did not quite do what he had to on the East Coast of America
at the weekend -- which was to look good in front of HBO television
executives, who have a strong in say in what World Boxing Council
champion Pernell Whitaker does next.
But his next fight will be for the championship.
Jacobs is the official No.1 contender, and in what was his final
warm-up bout before meeting Whitaker in the summer, he outpointed New
York's Jose Miguel Fernandez by an overwhelming margin. He was, however,
handicapped by injury from early in the 10-rounder.
But the undoubted man of the moment is Whitaker. Some two hours after
Jacobs had strutted his stuff, the ''sweet pea'' won his fourth world
title at different weights when he dethroned the World Boxing
Association light middleweight champion Julio Cesar Vasquez of
Argentina, who had beaten only once before, and was making his eleventh
defence.
The 31-year-old Whitaker was five inches smaller, had a reach
disadvantage of nine inches, but still did enough to take the title on
all the judges' scorecards.
The fact that he immediately said he would relinquish this particular
crown -- as if it was a worthless bauble -- to come back down a weight
to meet Jacobs should be awesome for the 29-year-old Scot, but Jacobs is
still convinced he is the man to buckle Whitaker and deprive him of his
greatest wish of being known as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the
world.
Saturday night in Atlantic City saw three of the best welterweights in
the world in action -- Whitaker, Jacobs, and WBA champion Ike Quartey of
Ghana, who punched South Korea's Jung-Oh Park to defeat inside four
rounds.
Jacobs was by far the least impressive, but he had to box from the
fourth round with a broad, deep gash on the middle knuckle of his right
hand which later required several stitches -- attention which was only
administered after a five-hour wait due to a Saturday night rush at the
local medical centre.
The Scot didn't even see Whitaker excel in his contest against
Vasquez, but was delighted to hear that the American confirmed he would
be next on his list.
Although the Scot's manager Mickey Duff has said he was negotiating
for the fight to go ahead in South Africa's Sun City, there was a
surprise boost for Jacobs when Dan Duva, one of a family dynasty which
handles Whitaker's affairs, indicated that the most likely venue is
Britain.
''Not Scotland,'' said Duva. ''Pernell is the man, and he doesn't have
to go into anybody's backyard to fight. But it looks like London in
July.
''Jacobs is the mandatory challenger and HBO television will be
covering the early rounds of the Wimbledon tennis tournament. We have a
deal with them, and it is more than possible that, with the equipment in
London in July that's where and when they will want to stage the fight.
''Personally I would love it to go on at the Royal Albert Hall. We
would have boxing's virtuoso, Pernell Whitaker, playing at one of the
greatest concert centres in the world -- he may even fight Gary Jacobs
wearing a tuxedo.''
But there is no shaking the Scot's confidence. ''I know I didn't look
good,'' Jacobs said. ''But I was in agony from the fourth round when I
caught Fernandez with a right uppercut. I didn't complain because when
you are a pro you don't want to let your opponent see you are hurt.
There was never any danger that I would lose.
''I had a corn on the middle knuckle of my right hand and it looked to
have healed, but when I hit him with that punch, it sliced open a wound.
Everytime I hit him after that it was as if someone was stucking a knife
into my hand.
''Now I want to let the injury heal, and I'm not interested in taking
any more warm-up fights. You have to be motivated in this game and I
want the real thing next -- myself against Whitaker. If it has to be in
London, fair enough. I have always said he is the best and I would go
anywhere to fight him because I still believe I am the one to beat
him.''
Personally, I would doubt that. Whitaker is something else, and
Vasquez, who had him down in the fourth round of their
light-middleweight battle, admitted afterwards that the American was too
good for him. Vasquez was deducted two points for holding but even
without those penalties Whitaker won well, and with a lot of style.
''I gave Vasquez the belt back right after the fight,'' said Whitaker.
''I don't want it because I am a natural welterweight, and I'll be
having my next fight against Gary Jacobs.
''I'm at the stage now where I want the boxing public to acclaim me as
the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world -- that's the crown I
want, even though it's unofficial. I get great fun out of what I do.
I'll carry on fighting and take on new challenges.''
Probably the greatest challenge on the horizon is a unification match
with the unbeaten Quartey. It would be nice to think that Jacobs could
put a damper on that, but the feeling in boxing circles is that Whitaker
against Quartey will be on some time this year.

THE chosen one returned, but only briefly. Prince Naseem Hamed, who is
actually a slip of a boy from Sheffield, was back in Scotland to defend
his World Boxing Council International super-bantamweight title, stepped
into the ring inside Livingston's Forum for less than one-and-a-half
rounds, and was back in his civvies almost before his unfortunate
opponent, Sergio Liendo, was back with us.
The Argentinian, a former holder of the WBC international title, was
knocked out after one minute and nine seconds of the second round and
lay on the floor for two minutes while medics fussed around him. For an
awful few minutes, memories of the previous week's big fight between
Nigel Benn and Gerald McClellan, who remains seriously ill after a
couple of brain operations, came rushing into the Forum.
Many of the 3500 in the arena for this Frank Warren/Katherine Morrison
show realised Liendo was in trouble, but there were still a large number
intoxicated by the atmosphere and also the alcohol to halt their
football-style chants, at least until the injured party had been helped
from the ring. They behaved like neanderthals and morons, especially
when the ring girl walked around holding up the round number.
Naseem, or Naz as his backers and handlers prefer to call him, entices
new recruits to the most brutal of sports because of his flair for the
outrageous. He puts on a show on either side of the ropes.
Again he made his slow rhythmic walk to the arena, pausing to dance to
his entry music ''Here Come The Hotstepper'' before somersaulting into
the ring. One of these nights he may be a fraction out in his timing and
end up tangled in the ropes like a dolphin in a tuna net. Credibility
zero before a glove has been landed.
On Saturday night he rocked the place by stepping into view wearing a
kilt and a pair of sunglasses. The kilt was removed to reveal a skirt of
leopard-skin strips over a pair of leopard-skin briefs. ''Cool shorts,''
he said later.
Cool is also 20-year-old Naseem, who is never flustered in the ring
and who has a most unorthodox style in that he rarely looks at his
opponent's face or eyes. Naseem watches the feet, waiting to strike when
he is sure the other man is off balance. It works, often in a
spectacular manner.
Having taken care of Liendo, who was regarded as a tough, resilient
fighter, Naseem's record is now 17 fights with 17 wins and 14 knockouts.
It is the basis for greatness, which is the status the boxer seeks, and
one which he surely will achieve.
He is good and no-one knows that more than Naseem, billed as the
Chosen One, himself. Understatement is not part of his fight plan as the
names on his waistband prove. Prince is emblazoned on front and king on
the back and he talks of having been given a gift -- from God, of
course.
Liendo might argue the blows which laid him down came rushing up from
hell. Liendo had never been stopped in his 49-fight professional career
and had never been knocked down.
The punch which began the scrambling of his senses may have been a
right upper cut delivered in the first round just after Liendo himself
had rattled Naseem, who frowned for a second as though surprised that
someone should have the audacity to touch him.
The second round saw the defending champion land a left to the right
side of the Argentinian's head followed sharply by a right. Liendo's
legs folded under him and his head thumped heavily against the canvas.
The Belgian referee, Daniel Van de Ville, should have protected Liendo
from further punishment, even though the fighter managed to get back to
his feet. It was clear even from the outside that he was in distress and
unable to defend himself as Naseem moved in to finish the task with a
fierce left hook to the chin.
Naseem is now looking for a fight with the World Boxing Association
super-bantamweight champion, Wilfredo Vazquez, although he has to make a
mandatory defence against a Venezuelan opponent. ''However, we have made
a six-figure offer to the Venezuelan to step aside and let us fight,''
Warren said.
There is little doubt Naseem would be a sensation on American
television with his flair for razzmatazz, but with his ability,
sharpness, balance, and punch more powerful than any of the
skinny-weights are entitled to pack, you sometimes wonder if he needs to
be so outrageously over the top. Still, he is one for greater things,
although he has still to be tagged properly, while many of the fighters
on the undercard have probably reached their destinations in the hurt
business.
Fighters like Marvellous Marvin O'Brien from Leeds, who was stopped
against Rob 'The Grim Reaper' Reid, won't be heading for Vegas. Neither
will Glasgow's Mike Deveney, who lost on points to Dean Philips of Wales
in a featherweight bout.
Another Glasgow fighter, Dave Anderson, had to fight virtually
one-handed for five rounds after he thought he had broken his right
wrist in a lightweight contest against Mike Hernon. Anderson won on
points, then discovered he had badly sprained his wrist.
Edinburgh's John Wilson had a disappointing night when his fight
against Darren Ashdon, of Stoke, was stopped in the third round. Both
fighters were disqualified for continuously infringing the rules. Use of
the head may be allowed on a Saturday night fight outside, but not
inside the ring.

IN HIS post-round winner's interview, Nick Faldo did a fair imitation
of Forrest Gump and said: ''Life is like a box of chocolates, you never
know what you're going to get.''
That vacuous comment was somewhat apt yesterday as Faldo went through
several extremes of emotion and expectation over the final hole of the
Doral Open in Miami, Florida, a tournament he would win in improbable
fashion.
Faldo had a one-stroke lead over Greg Norman at the eighteenth tee.
His drive ended up just inches into the water that lines the left side
of the fairway. He then hit a magnificent No.3-wood third shot that
landed just 25 feet from the cup on the narrow final green.
He two-putted for bogey, and resigned himself to a play-off with
Norman, at best. But Norman hit his second shot to the par 4 into the
lake. Said Faldo: ''I was thinking about a play-off, then all of a
sudden there was a quick groan, and someone said Greg was in the water.
Then the next thing I know, Peter Jacobsen had a 50 foot putt to tie
with me.
''Well, the way things have been going for him this year, I figured
he'd probably make it.''
Jacobsen missed, but not by much, and Faldo had the victory, having
shot a 69 to do it. Norman and Jacobsen, who began the day as
co-leaders, tied at 15 under par for second place.
Faldo spent a month on the West Coast learning how to putt on fast
American greens, with little visible success until now, missing the cut
in his last tournament after a disasterous mid-round switch from
cross-handed to conventional putting.
He never stopped working on the pratice greens, though, and, finally,
his hard work paid off. Faldo made 22 birdies at Doral this week, moving
into contention for an American title for the first time in more than a
year and a half. His win was just the second regular US tour victory,
having last won 11 years ago in 1984 at the Heritage Classic. He also,
of course, won the 1989 and 1990 Masters tournaments. Final aggregaetes

ARANTXA Sanchez Vicario suffered a surprise defeat in her first
tournament as world No.1, going down 7-5, 6-3 to Natasha Zvereva, of
Belarus, in the Evert Cup at Indian Wells, California, yesterday.
Zvereva, ranked ninth and seeded fourth, won only her second victory
in 10 matches against the top-seeded Sanchez Vicario, and advanced to
the final of the #286,000 event against eighth seed Mary Joe Fernandez,
who cruised past fifth seed Naoko Sawamatsu, of Japan, 6-4, 6-1.
The 23-year-old Spaniard, who took the No.1 ranking from German Steffi
Graf on Monday and will retain it regardless of her performance in
California, paid tribute to her opponent, saying: ''I think she played a
very good match and she hit very good shots. Maybe I just did not take
my chances.''
Zvereva, 23, had never before beaten a current world No.1, although
she had defeated former No.1s Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, host
of this event.
AUSTRALIAN teenager Mark Philippoussis powered his way past top seed
Todd Martin in straight sets to reach the final of the #210,000 Mass
Mutual Championships in Scottsdale, Arizona.
In the other semi-final yesterday, second seed Jim Courier rallied to
defeat third seed Stefan Edberg, of Sweden, 6-4, 6-7, 6-4.

PRESTWICK notched up a record eighth win in the CIS Insurance Indoor
Bowls League when they edged out Bainfield 72-67 in the final on
Saturday.
Bainfield lined up with the benefit of home advantage -- although that
wasn't in the original script.
The Scottish Indoor Bowling Association traditionally choose the home
club of the current national president as the final venue. So, with
Bainfield reaching the final for the third year in a row and their
member David Allan being national president, they enjoyed home
advantage.
Bainfield took advantage of local knowledge in the opening ends,
taking a 9-2 lead after two ends and moving 17-7 ahead after four.
But three ends later Prestwick had tied the match at 22-22 and,
counting nine shots without reply on the next end, moved 31-22 ahead.
By halfway Prestwick's lead had increased to 38-27, but Bainfield
counter-attacked to tie it at 43-43 after 13 ends.
Prestwick then regained the initiative, picking up eight shots for the
loss of two on the following end to move 51-45 ahead and they held their
advantage to the finish.
Bainfield did produce a late flourish that almost took them to
victory. Alex Ross saw his rink pick up eight shots over the last three
ends to beat Derek Bufton 22-16, and four shots over the last two ends
gave Alan Brown a 19-13 victory over Robert McCulloch.
Prestwick, however, won the title on the two other matches. Gary Hood
powered his way to a 24-12 win over newly-crowned world indoors pair
champion Alex Marshall.
David Gourlay Jr beat another member of the Marshall family, Alex's
brother Robert, 19-14. Details:
Prestwick 72, Bainfield 67 (G Hood 24, A Marshall 12; D Bufton 16, A
Ross 22; D Gourlay Jr 19, R Marshall 14; R McCulloch 13, A Brown 19).
* GARIOCH and West Lothian will line up at Edinburgh on Saturday in
the final of the CIS Insurance women's inter-club league.
Garioch edged the strong Auchinleck side 81-73 in Saturday's
semi-final at Stirling, while West Lothian beat holders Galleon 88-69 at
Midlothian.
* STIRLING made certain of a place in next season's first division in
the CIS Insurance Indoor League when they won yesterday's promotion
play-off match with Elgin 107-52.
Stirling moved ahead around the seventh end and pulled away to finish
ahead on all four rinks. Details:
Stirling 107, Elgin 52 (I Sneddon 22, G Donaldson 14, D McCormick 21,
A Thomson 17, B Stillie 30, I Williamson 10, G Craig 34, I Milne 11).

PETER McColgan, who won the Cupar six-mile race on Saturday, has given
up his UK citizenship and declared for the Republic of Ireland, writes
Doug Gillon.
McColgan, who ran the steeplechase for Northern Ireland in the 1986
Commonwealth Games, and for Britain in the 1991 world championships, ran
in Eire's world cross-country trial last weekend.
''I may be selected for the worlds at Durham by the Republic, as I'm
entitled to do, having been born in the North,'' he said yesterday. ''It
is mainly because Ireland's selection for endurance events is much
better than Britain's.
''All the best guys run in their trials, and you know where you are,
instead of being allowed to sit them out, and getting selected anyway,
as happens in Britain.
''I'm thinking of the 10,000 metres, or possibly even the marathon at
the Olympics in Atlanta. I suppose I could be running for Eire while Liz
is competing for Britain.''
Peter, who clocked 27min 51sec, was within 20sec of Allister Hutton's
course record in freezing conditions at Cupar, with wife Liz winning the
women's race, twentieth overall, in 30-34.
''I ran 29-39 three years ago on that course, after a week's rest,''
said Liz. ''Last week we came home from Florida, because I could not get
into the race I wanted to run there. Instead, on Sunday, I did a 20-mile
time trial, from Errol to Carnoustie. I'm not saying how fast, but it
was a personal best by several minutes.
''Peter and my dad were out on the road, with water bottles, getting
me used to drinking again for the marathon. I also trained hard during
the week, so I'm pretty pleased with the time. It was freezing. I ran in
shorts, and it was a real shock after Florida.''
Liz races the London Marathon on April 2, but added: ''I'm running a
half marathon in Lisbon next weekend, against Tecla Loroupe, the New
York Marathon winner.'' Results:
1, P McColgan (DHH) 27min 51sec; 2, S Weir (BT Pitreavie) 28-12; 3, D
Ross (Leslie Deans RC) 28-20. Veteran -- R Bell (DHH) 30-16. Teams -- 1,
Dundee Hawkhill 16pt; 2, Leslie Deans RC 27; 3, Fife 46. Women -- 1, E
McColgan (DHH) 30-34; 2, F Lothian (Fife) 32-30; 3, K Fisher (BT
Pitreavie (36.02). Veteran -- M McLaren (Fife) 36-36. Team -- Fife
340pt.
* BRITISH world champion Colin Jackson set an Australian all-comers'
record of 13.32sec to win the 110m hurdles at the Australian national
titles in Sydney yesterday.
The 28-year-old Welshman, who holds the world record for the event at
12.91sec, defied wet and blustery conditions at the Homebush Stadium to
edge out Australian Kyle Vander-Kuyp, with another Briton, Paul Gray,
finishing third.
Canadian Mark McKoy set the previous record of 13.37sec at the 1982
Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, a time equalled by Jackson in Melbourne
last month.

IT WAS just like old times for former NHL team-mates Doug Smail and
Laurie Boschman. They were on the ice together for the first time in
years and between them scored six goals as Fife Flyers upset
premier-division pace-setters Nottingham Panthers 8-4.
Boschman jetted in from Ottawa on Friday and his two debut goals made
him an instant hit with the fans. Smail, who returned from a flying
visit to his family in Colorado hours before the game, top-scored with
four.
Flyers, who have fallen to eighth in the table, were 4-1 down at the
end of the second period but coach Jim Lynch's side hit a magnificent
seven without reply in a 13-minute final-period blitz.
Injury-hit Edinburgh Racers crashed 6-1 at league champions Cardiff
Devils, former Racer Hilton Ruggles hitting four.
First-division Paisley Pirates wrapped up their promotion play-off
slot with a 5-1 home win over mid-table Medway Bears.
Doomed Dumfries Vikings crashed 13-7 to Guildford Flames. Results:
Premier division: Basingstoke 11, Humberside 9; Cardiff 6, Edinburgh
1; Durham 4, Bracknell 9; Fife 8, Nottingham 4; Milton Keynes 7,
Peterborough 3; Sheffield 14, Whitley 4. Division 1: Dumfries 7,
Guildford 13; Paisley 5, Medway 1; Slough 7, Trafford 7; Solihull 13,
Lee Valley 4; Telford 14, Blackburn 5.

GORDON Muirhead and his Livingston team of Russell Keiller, Bob Kelly,
and Peter Loudon won the Macallan Scottish Curling Championships at
Perth yesterday, beating Warwick Smith of Perth 8-4.
Earlier, Muirhead had defeated Hammy McMillan 3-2 after an extra end
in the semi-final between the teams that had finished first and second
in the rankings.
That gave Muirhead a straight passage to the final, and put McMillan
into an eliminator against Warwick Smith, who beat Struan MacNee of
Murrayfield 8-4 in the semi-final between the third and fourth placed
teams. Smith beat McMillan 6-5 to reach his first national final, but
could not match the experience of the Muirhead rink.
Muirhead started the final by blanking the first end to retain last
stone and took the lead in the second end with a draw that just
out-counted Smith's stone in the house.
In the third end, Smith responded with a single, but Muirhead applied
the pressure in the fourth, drawing two to edge 3-1 ahead.
Smith could only score a single at the fifth but Muirhead maintained
the pressure by blanking the sixth.
The seventh end turned out to be the telling episode. Muirhead's team
put draw after draw into the house until, when Smith had to deliver his
own first stone, he was facing a count of at least four. Both of Smith's
attempted double take-outs just got angles wrong and this left Muirhead
with yet another simple draw to make it four and transform the game
score to 7-2.
Smith responded with a two at the eighth, but Muirhead retained his
supremacy and put a freeze in front of Smith's best counter in the
ninth.
The Muirhead rink now go on to represent Scotland at the World Curling
Championships in Brandon, Manitoba, next month. In doing so, Peter
Loudon joins his sisters, Kate and Edith, in Scottish colours as they
have already qualified in Kirsty Hay's team for the women's event.
Results:
Semi-finals -- Muirhead 3, McMillan 2 (after extra end); Smith 8,
MacNee 4; Eliminator -- Smith 6, McMillan 5.
Final:

SCOTLAND'S Peter Nicol fell victim to the continued return to form of
England's Del Harris in the final of the British Masters Telesquash
championships at the Skean Dhu courts, Dyce.
Nicol, the world No.5 from Inverurie, went into the final as
favourite, having won his opening two matches in straight games.
However, Harris had posted his threat by knocking out world No.2 and
top seed, Peter Marshall.
Harris drew first blood in the final, winning a closely contested
opening game by 15-12. But Nicol fought back and levelled the match by
taking the second game by a similar margin.
However, any aspirations the Scot may have been harbouring were soon
dispelled, as the 25-year-old Englishman went on to take control and
claimed the title on the fifth match-ball, 15-12, 12-15, 15-9, 16-14.
In the Scottish women's Telesquash championship final, Aberdeen's
Claire Waddell beat defending champion Alison Bowie 19-17, 15-10.
* STRATHCLYDE University became the first Scottish team to win the
British Universities Squash Championships, beating Manchester
Metropolitan 3-2 in yesterday's Birmingham final.
Steve Richardson, David Heath, and Norwegian Cinut-Eric Lovit, claimed
Strathclyde's points. while Colin Woodward and Laurie Maclaughlan
completed the line-up.

DONALD MacFarlane, the Grange centre forward, has not been finding the
net with the regularity befitting a Scottish internationalist.
However, he did manage to avoid embarrassment for the holders at
Uddingston yesterday in the quarter-final of the Scottish Cup.
In the only tie to survive the weather, MacFarlane hit the target just
two minutes from time to enable Grange to beat Pender Uddingston 1-0.
Second-division Uddingston's tactic was to frustrate the opposition,
and this they duly did.
However, with a penalty-stroke competition looming, MacFarlane finally
ended the misery. Results:

DISQUALIFICATION in yesterday's giant slalom denied Scottish champion
Gareth Rudd of Edinburgh a double at the East of Scotland FIS Senior
Championships in Glenshee. It put paid to his hopes of adding to the
slalom title he won on Saturday.
Rudd attacked yesterday's fast open course on Glas Maol, with a one
and a half second lead going into the second run. At the start of the
final steep, he lost his line and fell. He rejoined the course, but
missed a gate leaving 16-year-old Ross Baxter of the Scottish B Squad
with a deserved win.
The weekend belonged to 16-year-old Tessa Pirie (Aberdeen) who won
both the women's titles. Results:

SCOTLAND yesterday won the British men's cross-country team
championship for the first time over a bleak, windswept course at
Druridge Bay, near Ashington, on the Northumberland coast.
It was a trail designed to replicate that on which the world
championships will be staged a fortnight on Saturday at Durham, and with
Tommy Murray (IBM Spango Valley) and Robert Quinn (Kilbarchan) finishing
fourth and fifth, Scotland will have two athletes in the UK team.
The first seven yesterday -- not one of whom was in the UK squad for
the European championships last November -- were chosen automatically.
Adrian Passey and Simon Pearson were given the extra places at last
night's selectorial meeting. Passey lost a shoe, and by the time he had
untied the mud-clogged laces and replaced it, he was last, having lost
nearly 90 seconds. Yet he battled back to tenth.
No Scots are in either of the junior teams, although Vikki McPherson,
eighth in the women's race, is second non-travelling reserve. Dave
Connolly (Shettleston), twelfth, and Hailey Parkinson (Edinburgh
University), thirteenth, acquitted themselves best in the junior races.
The senior men's event was a spectacular triumph for Murray, reduced
by a virus to fourth at the Scottish championships in Perth last month,
and also for Quinn, who missed the Scottish altogether with a cold, but
gains his first British vest nine years after almost losing a foot in a
motorbike accident.
Murray, the three-time Scottish champion, demonstrated courage after a
fall which would have seen a lesser man retire. He crashed heavily when
lying fourth, on the heels of the eventual runner-up, Dave Clarke,
losing at least 50 metres.
''It really knocked the breath out of me,'' said Murray who was passed
by several men when he fell, and finished with his head, face, and the
whole of his left side caked in mud. ''I reckon it cost me a medal.''
Quinn, who had pins inserted in an ankle in 1986, had run at the world
event as a junior in 1984, and his refusal to give in is worthy of
Kiplingesque eulogies. ''I always knew I would make it one day,'' he
said. ''But I nearly never ran here. Every day since Tuesday I'd been
thinking of calling off with a cold.''
Keith Anderson, the Scottish champion, who was due to compete in
North's colours, pulled out with flu, while Chris Robison, runner-up to
Anderson for that title, dropped out sufering from a severe stitch. He
had been lying fifth in the early stages, ahead of both Murray and
Quinn, but perhaps paid the penalty for having started too fast.
Results:
Men. Seniors (12,000 metres): 1, S Duval (Midlands) 39min 29sec; 2, D

GREGG Hansford was killed yesterday when his car crashed in the
opening round of the Australian Super Touring Car Championship in
Melbourne.
His Ford Mondeo collided with a car on the second lap of the race
before spinning off the circuit, hitting a tyre wall, and bouncing back
on to the Phillip Island track in a cloud of dust. It was then hit by an
oncoming Peugeot.
Hansford, a native of Brisbane, was a vastly experienced racer, who
won the Bathurst 1000km race, Australia's premier touring car event, in
1993.

UP TO 100 jobs could be lost at BBC Scotland, according to union
officials.
The concern involves production workers, and it is feared one
department -- make-up, costume, and design -- will be axed while further
cuts will be spread through-out the Queen Margaret Drive building in
Glasgow.
A 5% cut to the budgets of regional programme makers will come into
effect on April 1. Union officials claim job losses will be in reaction
to this.
Representatives of the Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and
Theatre's Trade Union (Bectu) are expected tomorrow to meet Mr Andy
Davy, BBC's head of resources Scotland.
Mr Ross Kimbley, chair of the union's Glasgow branch, said: ''We have
been called in for a resource meeting which only means one thing: people
will go.'' He added: ''We've heard 100 job losses and we've heard of 60
job losses.''
Fears were raised over the weekend by a magazine article, and a
strange encounter.
In the March 3 issue of Broadcast magazine, which provides information
for the television trade, there was a two-page advert with the headline,
BBC Resources: A Wealth of Available Talent. However, there was no
mention of BBC Scotland's production design, costumes and make-up. They
were included in a similar blurb for BBC Wales.
Then at a sports event, a BBC crew were filmed by a BBC news crew:
they were told it was for a news item to be broadcast next week.
A BBC spokesperson last night could neither confirm nor deny the
claims.

JAMES Traynor, who has rarely watched a junior football game in recent
years, is very ill-equipped to pontificate on the state of this grade of
football.
While agreeing that ''junior'' is a misnomer, as it is
semi-professional, I have to dispute his views on the Dalry Thistle v
Whitburn fifth-round Scottish Junior Cup-tie last on Saturday, when five
Dalry players were sent off and referee Cameron Melville abandoned the
game in the eightieth minute following crowd trouble.
As a spectator, I can assure him it was far from a violent game. Three
players were red-carded for dissent and two for fouls. In fact, Dalry
were reduced to eight men in the forty-seventh minute and play went on
for another 30 minutes without any trouble on or off the park.
When referee Melville, a sports journalist, sent another two Dalry men
off, a bottle was apparently thrown on to the park. At that point he
took the teams off.
Unfortunately, big junior cup-ties attract people who normally never
darken the doors of junior grounds, and spectators are allowed to drink
alcohol at these games. It is the law that ought to be amended, and not
the attitude of the thousands of players and hard-working volunteer
junior committees and officials who are dedicated to this grade of
football.
If The Herald gave any coverage to junior football perhaps those of us
who know the game would pay some attention to James Traynor.
Drew Cochrane,
9 Charles Street,
Largs.
James Traynor replies: So, there was a 30-minute period in the game
when there was no trouble at all? That says it all, don't you think, Mr
Cochrane? Incidentally, we have been covering junior football since the
relaunch of the sports section, but perhaps you have been too busy
keeping the crime count.

MUCH has been said recently about the current sad state of Aberdeen
FC, and certainly the present team must rank as possibly the worst ever
in the club's long and proud history. The warning signs, however, have
been flashing for some time now and it comes as no great surprise to see
them near the bottom of this farce of a 10-club premier division.
Make no mistake, it is the players who have brought this disgrace on
the club I have followed passionately for close on 50 years, although
the board must accept some blame in their premature appointment of the
club's greatest ever player as manager when it was perfectly obvious he
should have been cutting his teeth elsewhere.
Possibly it has escaped many people's memories, but the real driving
force behind the great Dons sides of the eighties was not Alex Ferguson
but his assistant Archie Knox. Could he be persuaded to return and work
his magic once more?
Surely money could be made available to prise him from Ibrox.

GOLFING readers may remember the report in The Herald (Douglas Lowe,
October, 1993) of the proposal by the Scottish Golf Union to build a
''Golf Academy'', with an increase in the levy on each club member to #5
per annum.
You subsequently published several letters of criticism.
I recently read that the autocratic manner in which these proposals
were produced has been brought to heel. Democracy has thankfully
prevailed. The 16 regions threw out the scheme as it stood, and have
told the SGU to think again. The site in Fife has been rejected, and the
matter of accommodation facilities vetoed.
Two points emerged.
First: since the scheme is still (regrettably) being considered, but
at a reduced cost, why are we still being levied at #5 per annum? That
figure is based on the original, huge proposed expenditure. The SGU is
now bulging with money which will not all be required, if their costings
were correct.
Second: since the first ad hoc committee's scheme has been rightly
rejected, the new committee should have been composed of entirely new
members. This is not the case.
In view of the above, we should have a levy holiday in 1996, and then
return to the previous one of #2.40 per annum.
The best solution, of course, would be to drop the whole madcap idea.

IT must have been obvious to anyone watching the Tommy Burns interview
on the BBC1 Friday Sportscene TV programme (February 24), that a new
type of incumbent has taken over the managerial chair at Celtic Park.
Apart from Mr Burns' predecessor (who was rarely there to be judged),
a Celtic manager has always been a man of quality, diplomatic and
restrained in speech and manner while dealing with the media in order to
project the correct image of a major football club with an illustrious
record.
There is no doubt that in the past, hard words and earthy criticisms
have been directed at the players on many occasions by the manager, but
it was always behind closed doors, thus protecting the innocents from
public humiliation.
On this occasion Mr Burns seemed to let his tongue run away with him
and what we saw and heard was an embarrassing display of disloyalty to a
number of his players including the team captain. Irresponsible
utterances like administering a kick up the backside to jildy up players
to greater efforts, did nothing to enhance either the Burns image or the
club.
A new era is dawning at Parkhead mainly by the influence of the ''man
who weareth the chequered scone''. It would be unforgivable if that were
to be compromised by ham-fisted public relations. It is an elementary
rule of command that disloyalty to those under you must only induce
resentment and inevitably lack of effort.

LIKE many millions, I watched the Benn-McClellan fight.
Had it not been for the outcome the fight would have been regarded as
one of the ''All-time Great Fights'' of this or any other century.
When, on Sunday morning, I realised the repercussions for the American
boxer, I felt sad -- a little guilty and sickened.
This fight was billed as ''a fight to the end'' -- ''a fight to the
death''. One of the boxers would have the ''living daylights knocked out
of him''. So it was to be -- McClellan the unfortunate one. It could
have been Benn.
Benn should be exonerated for his verbal reactions after the fight but
two things impressed me:
1. The interview team on ITV should not have interviewed Benn to the
extreme they did, revealing Benn's natural reaction following an epic
encounter. The team should have been made aware of the possible severity
of McClellan's injuries and curtailed their activities, and of more
importance:
2. The modern athlete, particularly in contact sports, mainly boxing
(or even rugby), is capable of being honed to an extent whereby he is
capable of hitting harder and absorbing more physical punishment.
The brain, however, responds to the intense trauma as it always has,
being rattled within a boney skull. It bleeds and becomes bruised, thus
the problem.
Unless this simple medical concept is taken on board by the boxing
authorities there will be more serious injuries.
If the sheer power and killing potential of the modern fighter cannot
be nullified then the sport must accept the inevitable.

DUNDEE United midfielder Billy McKinlay is the most unlikely soccer
rebel and yet, at this moment, he is a time-bomb who threatens the whole
structure of the Scottish game.
McKinlay is proceeding with a court action against the Tannadice team
and the option contract which has bound him to United since he was a
teenager.
The Scotland player, who will be 26 next month, has never been the
kind of player to rock the boat. He has never been in any off-field
trouble.
He lives quietly in Broughty Ferry with his family and when you talk
to him about what he is doing he seems puzzled by the whole business.
But, with the occasional look of bewilderment, there is a
determination that he wants to control his own destiny for the first
time in his adult life.
If that means going to court then McKinlay will do that with the same
dedication he applies to his football.
He pointed out: ''I only want what everyone else already has, the
opportunity to say what direction my life can take in the future. That
surely cannot be too much to ask?
''It's almost 10 years since I signed for United and, almost before I
was allowed to vote, I had signed a huge part of my career away.
Footballers don't have a long life in the game. Maybe a dozen years?
''And there I was with eight or nine of them committed to the one
club. It wasn't right, but it took me a long time to realise that. When
you're a kid and you are offered a contract with a senior club, all you
look at is the chance to play first-team football. You don't see very
much further in front of you. Then things happen in your career and you
start to think more deeply about the whole business.''
In McKinlay's case he married his wife Donna and as a family man he
recognised that he needed security. When he broke a leg against
Dunfermline three years ago and was sidelined for nine months, a
career-threatening injury loomed.
Then, too, there was his elevation to the international team and the
discovery at first hand that there was much more to a footballer's life
than what was on offer on Tayside.
He said: ''You go into a squad of players with Scotland and you feel
like the poor relation. It's always been that way with any of the
players from Tannadice.
''As a youngster I used to hear the older players talking about the
gulf in wages between them and the lads they were playing alongside for
their country. I listened but it did not hit me until I was there
myself.
''It's then you begin to wonder where your life is going. The answer
in my case was not too far, so I decided to do something about it.''
What McKinlay did was to seek expert legal advice and, following that,
he decided to take the club to court.
He has not publicly criticised Dundee United and won't do so now. Nor
will he accept that he is carrying the banner for all the other players
who are suffering from the long contracts, and the option clauses, they
have signed.
Already the option clause is going to be kicked firmly into touch on
the instructions of FIFA, but McKinlay remains committed to challenging
the entire contract in court.
That is why it could be so vital to the game here in Britain and,
perhaps, around the world. The footballing establishment must be
concerned at the prospect of the whole system being disrupted.
If the McKinlay case proceeds -- and it will be dealt with some time
this year -- then all contracts could be called into question. The whole
game could be plunged into anarchy and all because one club, Dundee
United, have relied too long, and too heavily, on an option clause which
was always questionable in law, always morally flawed.
McKinlay reflected: ''Sometimes I wonder how I got into all of this
and I know my father has worried about whether I am doing the right
thing. But I have had expert advice and I know that I want to look after
my own life from now on.
''To be honest, I believe that the Players' Union should have done far
more about these contracts before now, not just going to the League the
way they did with Gary Bollan before he was sold to Rangers -- but by
going to the courts, by helping other players do what I am doing now.
''Don't get me wrong. I'm no martyr. I am doing this primarily for
myself, with the hope that other, younger players can benefit. But
mostly it is to allow me, Billy McKinlay, to control my own affairs the
way other people of my age can do.
''It must seem crazy to anyone outside football that we can be tied in
this way, but it happens. It has happened to me and all I want is the
chance to move to another club, try to improve myself, get a better life
for Donna and our three children. What's wrong with that?''
There is, of course, nothing wrong with that. All McKinlay looks for
is the chance to fulfil his ambitions the way other young men of his age
can do.
The McKinlay Case -- and it may become known as that -- could blow the
whole game and its archaic laws apart.

Scotland 26, Wales 13
THE Order of the Bath should be procured immediately, twice over, and
pinned squarely on the chests of Eric Peters and Dave Hilton.
Their tries, so different in preparation and execution, were proof
positive that Scotland now have the wherewithal and, perhaps even more
importantly, the confidence to score from any of the myriad of different
situations which come up in the course of a game.
The names of the two Bath players are entered on the scoresheet and
each in his own way took his chance with skilful alacrity, but this
Grand Slam scene-setting win was carved out on as solid a team
performance as Scotland have strung together in this season of
dramatically changing fortunes.
The Scots went behind to a soft try from Robert Jones after only two
minutes. In Paris two weeks ago it was Philippe Saint-Andre who had set
Scottish hearts a-twitter with the early touchdown, but, just as in
Paris, the Scots put the disappointment behind them and started again
from square one.
The pack played superbly well and the Welsh lineout threat, in the
form of the athletic Gareth Llewellyn and the 6ft 10in Derwyn Jones, was
largely nullified by dint of some old-fashioned sniping and harrying.
The platform provided by the Scottish pack was put to good use by
those outside them. Under the tutelage of Dougie Morgan and Richie
Dixon, the Scots have endeavoured to develop a pattern of continuity
rugby, and time and again on Saturday the ball was recycled to
tremendous effect.
The Scottish back-row of Morrison, Peters, and Wainwright is working
as a solid unit, and Peters, in particular, sparkles.
That other man called Peter -- Wright of that ilk -- without being a
devastatingly destructive scrummager, continues to do all that is asked
of him in the tight but in the loose he performs like a thwarted
fly-half.
The two returnees to the Scotland side, Doddie Weir and Scott
Hastings, fitted in as to the manner born. Weir, who brings
back-row-like dexterity to his role at lock, played one of his best
games yet in a Scotland jersey, while Hastings has surely booked his
passage to the World Cup in South Africa with an eager display.
There were no ethereal flip-passes from Gregor Townsend this time
around but, with his confidence on a new-found high, the young Gala
man's scalding acceleration continues to pose questions for opposition
defences that they would rather not answer.
The Melrose half-back partnership of Redpath and Chalmers supplied the
well-oiled hinge on which the entire Scottish performance depended. Once
again Chalmers fluffed the now obligatory drop-goal attempt but in all
other respects, with some seriously testing garryowens and an
intelligent mix-and-match of kick and pass, the fly-half indicated that
he is again back to his commanding best.
Young Craig Joiner on the left wing had not much to do in an offensive
sense but, on one occasion, he did manage to insert himself into Welsh
ranks when a try seemed in the offing and, with added experience, we
will hopefully see him coming off his beat in search of the work that
will allow him to utilise his sprinter's pace.
And what can we say of Kenny Logan that hasn't been said before? The
Stirling County man, brimming with confidence, is a superstar in the
making. He possesses that rare quality of buzzing unpredictability that
sets games alight and has the crowd on its feet.
His scything run, first up the left touchline and then destructively
arcing inside, was the precursor to the Peters try and, for a moment
later on it seemed as if he had notched his first Five Nations'
touchdown only to have it chalked off for a forward pass. That elusive
try, though, will not be long in coming.
Gavin Hastings was, once again, inspirational. He missed two
relatively simple penalty-goal efforts early on but, with 16 points from
the boot, including yet another 50-plus metres Exocet, he raises his
Scottish record tally to 538. The bare statistics, though, pale into
insignificance when compared to his worth to the side as a totem of
almost talismanic significance.
The now obligatory early try came after one minute 50 seconds. From a
lineout on the Scottish 22, Nigel Davies and Emyr Lewis did the real
damage before Robert Jones picked up loose ruck-ball and scampered in
under the posts. Jenkins converted and Scotland were in familiar
territory of having to start afresh.
Hastings, after having missed two penalty attempts, made amends in the
eleventh minute with his first penalty goal. Scotland had successfully
put the disastrous start behind them and for the remainder of the first
half were constantly on the attack. Hastings kicked Scotland to within a
single point of the Welsh with his second successful penalty and for
fully 10 minutes Wales were given a lesson in total rugby.
Eric Peters' try, which came on the half-hour mark as Scotland trailed
7-6, was a classic. It was born deep within Scottish territory as Wayne
Proctor's return of a Craig Chalmers punt found Rob Wainwright on the
Scottish 22.
It was just what the Army doctor ordered. Wainwright steadied as Gavin
Hastings got into position to take the pass. The Scottish captain
eschewed the temptation to kick to touch and set Weir off. Next came
Logan's barnstorming charge upfield and Peters read the situation
immaculately to be on hand for the scoring pass. Hastings converted and
Scotland were well ensconced in the driving seat.
The next Scottish try, just five minutes later, was equally
impressive. Wales were under intense pressure as the Scots drove, and
drove again, at their line. Four times the ball was churned from rucks
on the Welsh line and, eventually, Hilton grabbed his chance. The Bath
butcher pushed while Iain Morrison pulled and then he was over for the
try. Flower of Scotland rang around the packed stadium as Hastings made
ready for the successful conversion attempt.
From a Scottish point of view the second half was not as inspiring as
the first. Credit, then, to Wales who tried to raise their game from the
Scots-induced mediocrity to which it had descended.
Scotland struck first with a 51-metre penalty goal from Hastings. That
made it 23-7 and Wales could only reply with two penalty goals from Neil
Jenkins. Ten minutes from the end Hastings speared home another penalty
goal and it was all over. Manager Duncan Paterson's semi-final had been
won and now all roads lead to Twickenham with a chance to make history
and grab Grand Slam glory.

SKYE Camanachd look set to take action which could lead to their
Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup fourth-round tie against Oban Camanachd being
halted. The club have indicated that they could go as far as taking
legal steps to prevent the match being played this Saturday.
The island side are up in arms following the second postponement of
the tie on Saturday. Severe weather conditions in Oban and Portree meant
that both sides' home pitches were unplayable, as was the third choice,
Spean Bridge, which had been placed on standby.
In the interim, however, association fixtures secretary John Willie
Campbell had taken steps to have the tie transferred to Inverness, where
the game's top venue, the Bught Park, had become available and was
playable.
Skye Camanachd have demanded a full explanation from the Camanachd
Association. Skye's view is that the game should not have been called
off until Saturday morning, as had been indicated in the fixture list.
They feel that having organised players to play at any venue necessary,
including bringing at least one player home from Edinburgh, the call-off
on Friday evening was at best unnecessary.
Camanachd Association president Duncan Cameron, who agreed the match
was off on Friday night without apparently knowing that Inverness had
been identified as a possible venue, said the ball is now firmly in
Skye's court. He said: ''Skye have asked us for an explanation of the
circumstances and we will do that as soon as possible, but in the
meantime the match has to be re-scheduled for this weekend, and it is up
to Skye what they do now.''
Skye are furious and a club source said that they were prepared to
''go the whole way on this one.'' Results:
Marine Harvest League. Division 2 -- St Andrews University 1, Tayforth
17. Division 3 -- Fort William 1, Boleskine 1; Glenurquhart 6, Aberdeen
University 2. Valerie Fraser Cup. First round -- Lochcarron 1, Kilmallie
1. McTavish Juvenile Cup. Preliminary round -- Lovat 1, Beauly 3.

THIS year nobody expected, nobody in Scottish rugby at all, to win
much outside of a wooden spoon. Certainly not the Grand Slam, the
Calcutta Cup, the Triple Crown.
Let me tell you this about Scottish rugby. Back in 1990, when Scotland
did this thing and won this feat, it took a dreadful pride. Thus rugby
became a particularly national sport. And in it a certain hubris.
But this time Scotland took a proper sense of proportion on Saturday
at Murrayfield in Edinburgh. Scotland played Wales, the legendary rugby
country of the world. Scotland beat Wales, too, 27 to 13.
Scotland had beaten adverseries before -- but we like the Welsh, we
get to meet so many of our fellow Celtic tourists, dark little fellows
and their wives, here in Scotland, shopping with avidity, and the
Welshmen are glad to be here. They came in their droves, our little
Celtic cousins.
It seems bizarre but we Celts understand it: the Irish and the Welsh
come to Scotland and to this land, replete with snow and sleet and rain
and reasonably cheap guest houses. Amazingly, the Irish and the Welsh
often come to Scotland just to watch the game on telly and in clubs, and
leave out the stadium in Murrayfield itself.
Not amazingly at all, a goodly number of Scottish rugby fans prefer to
watch the drama unfold in their own, or friends', houses.
The wives cook the food and take the young ones out for the
afternoons, leaving the men to rattle down Shorts pies and beans, or
chilli and pitta bread. Or leaving the menfolk with the young boys,
teaching them how to be a glutton, a bibulous uncle -- me -- or a rugby
fan.
I have watched the rugby internationals many a time in chums' houses,
it's a bit like poker games late at night.
Occasionally watching international rugby, especially watching
Scotland, is a bit like Indian Poker -- you are not just taking a chance
but doing it with Michael Cimmino as the film director.
Was at Cartha Queen's Park Rugby Club with a Welshman called Wayne
Evans, comes from the Rhonda, a mining hole in the ground called
Treorchy, works in Hillington, where redundancy stalks the same dark
valleys of Scotland as it did in his native land.
When the game started, the Welsh had the hwyll of their national
anthem: they always had that. When the Flower of Scotland air came,
every dark-blued player on the park took it up and so did the crowds at
Murrayfield. I am there at this Glasgow rugby club. In Ireland or Wales
the club would be full of men, women, and children, standing to
attention, singing their anthem.
Scotland has indeed its sportsmen and sportswomen recognising the
motivation of an anthem, but its people need to know that, too.
Certainly I believe that the Scottish rugby team took much out of
filling their lungs with a national pride, made concrete with this song.
Cartha has a lot of old friends, and young ones too. There must be
some 50-odd people in there. Niall, the social convener, an Irish fellow
and long-time pal, isn't -- he is at Murrayfield.
Coach Brian Gervase, whom we have met many a time before in my rugger
peregrinations, is in the Glasgow clubhouse, and pal John McCarron is as
well. He is enjoying every minute. I hae ma doots about his 12-year-old
daughter Vivienne, a first-year pupil at Lourdes Secondary in nearby
Cardonald. A very nice girl who appears taller than me, she endears
herself to me forever by slapping the best spread in front of me at
half-time you could ever imagine.
''There's yer pie,'' she said, the wee angel that she was. The pie is
made by a company called Calder Millerfield, which has its base in
Bridgeton. The pie was enough to keep you going fur the next year. Sorry
to dwell on the pies, but there was more steak stew in it than Elizabeth
David ever thought up, and better meat than Wales could come up with in
its entire international team, who at half-time were now down by a
considerable amount and Scotland were swanning about like Jim Baxter, no
bothering and lighting up a fag.
Eddie the schoolteacher sent me up another half, and more pals turned
up. Time for me to go, so I did. Oddly, I turned into the Pollok Junior
Football Club, for I had heard that soccer lot were resplendent with a
full screen display and a wheen of Taffies, up from Aberdare, not a kick
in the bahookie from Pontypridd, from where my chum Kim Howells MP hails
-- and, in between, Tom Jones, the world-famous entertainer, hails too.
The wheen of Taffies hailed something rotten. They had come here for a
second year to Glasgow, preferring it to snobby Edinburgh, but revealed
a dreadful statement. Lovely wee lads they were. ''Problem is,'' said
young Michael Shephard, from this small and damn-near unemployable area
of Ponty, ''Glasgow pubs tell us we're not allowed to sing!''
We made them sing, in Welsh. You didn't need a drink to greet, and I
did, and then told them of all the spots in which Welshness and rugby,
and defeat, could be celebrated, and Scots could stand a drink in their
rare triumph.
Sunday I met the same lads and others in an hotel on the South-Side of
Glasgow. The lads were grand. ''Fair do's,'' said Gwilym, from Ebbw
Vale. ''Just kick the ordure out of the English the next game and send
us a copy of your paper.'' He didn't say ordure.
The problem is,
said one fan,
Glasgow pubs
tell us we're not
allowed to sing

ALEXANDER Cejka, the 24-year-old Czech-born German, played almost
nerveless golf yesterday in a final round 69 to win the Andalucia Open,
his first European PGA Tour victory.
Cejka, who had begun the day joint leader with Sweden's Anders
Forsbrand, won by three shots from Italian Costantino Rocca with a
four-round aggregate of 278, six under par.
Irishman Paul McGinley and Australian Wayne Riley were joint third on
283 and the first four were the only players to finish under par on a
very difficult course.
Cejka, who was born in Marienbad and escaped over the Czech border
with his father when he was only nine, joked: ''I think I am the second
German to win on the Tour after Bernhard Langer, but perhaps the Czechs
will claim me as their first winner.
''My father went back and my parents and grandparents still live
there. I am just pleased to be a winner and I am sure I shall hear from
Bernhard. He is still my hero, because I have always looked up to him as
a big star.''
Cejka could hardly have made a better start yesterday, for he birdied
four of the first six holes to go out in 33. On the far more difficult
back nine he dropped shots at the eleenth and fourteenth, but finished
with a flourish with a birdie at the 388-yard last.
Forsbrand was only two shots behind at the turn, but dropped five
shots coming home and the only real challenge to Cejka came from Rocca.
The big-hitting Italian came from one over to four under with two holes
to play, but ruined his chance with a bogey 4 at the short seventeenth.
He still finished in 67.
Rocca, however, blamed his third-round 78 for not winning the
tournament. ''I putted like a dog, a bad dog yesterday. Otherwise I
would have won,'' he said.
McGinley, who has missed the cut in his last three tournaments, came
good with two rounds of 69 to come battling through the field, while
Riley, based in Camberley, birdied the last hole to gain third place
with the Irishman.
Jose Maria Olazabal, the US Masters champion playing his first
tournament for three months, shot 70 yesterday for 288, four over par,
and, though not satisfied, said: ''I think I have time to get into good
shape for Augusta.''
* WELSHMAN James Lee has won the Kenya Open in Nairobi with a record
19-under aggregate total of 265. William Guy, of Buchanan Castle, was
top Scot in joint sixth place on 11-under-par 273, and Cowal's Russell
Weir was a further two shots adrift. Leading scores (British or Irish
unless stated):
265 -- J Lee 66, 66, 65, 68.
270 -- T Bjorn (Denmark) 64, 68, 67, 71; C Williams (S Africa) 65, 73,
65, 67.
Other scores included: 273 -- V Philips 67, 68, 68, 70; W Guy 70, 66,
68, 69. 275 -- R Weir 70, 69, 69, 67.
* STIRLING University golf scholarship student Maria Hjorth, from
Sweden, won the Spanish women's open amateur golf championship at Las
Brisas on the Costa del Sol yesterday. She beat leading qualifier Ana
Belen Sanchez by 6 and 5 in the final. None of the Scottish and English
qualifiers got past the second round. Results:
Semi-finals -- M Hjorth (Sweden) beat I Tinning (Denmark), 1 hole; A B
Sanchez (Spain) beat K Andersson (Sweden), at 20th. Final -- Hjorth beat
Sanchez, 6 and 5.
* BORDERER Craig Hislop's challenge for the Spanish Amateur
championship title came to an end in Saturday's quarter-finals at the
Club de Campo course in Malaga. Hislop, who along with Barclay Howard
and Les McLaughlin had qualified for the matchplay stages, lost by 4 and
3 to experienced Spaniard Jose Maria Zamora.
* GORDON Sherry, of Kilmarnock Barassie, was knocked out in the third
round of the Argentinian Amateur Championship at the Jockey Club in
Buenos Aires on Saturday by his Great Britain and Ireland playing
partner Padraig Harrington by one hole.

NOW, hold the bus, stop the world. But there's one thing that's
glaring us right in the face, and it's that there are supposed to be
league games next Saturday.
If we, as a country, are at all serious about mounting a challenge to
those very nice English chappies in two weeks' time, then can I suggest
that they are scrapped, or at least that the international players are
told not to play?
The medics in charge of the team will give you the nod that looking
after Gavin's men is a bit like holding together Emergency Ward Ten with
sticky-backed plastic. ''Are there any injuries?'' you ask. ''Yes,''
they say with a knowing look, ''we have a few knocks.''
And many of those knocks come on league Saturdays a week before big
games. Last weekend, for instance, we were told that Kenny Logan and
Kenny Milne had leg knocks, and Logan had his leg protected against the
Welsh, did he not? Likewise Bryan Redpath had a strained groin, and that
doesn't clear up in a week. There will have been other injuries we never
heard about, there always are. So, playing a week before a big game
affects you in that game.
As for the final proof in all of this, may I cite a certain Mr Gavin
Hastings, who has picked and chosen his games quite wonderfully this
season in an attempt to be fit for the important matches, a feat he has
managed with chilling accuracy. He missed his club's defeat by West of
Scotland last week, for example.
If you were the Scottish coaches, your ideal preparation would be to
have your team this coming weekend at Murrayfield, to loosen their limbs
on the one hand, and fine-tune their game plan on the other. I cannot
help but think that Dougie Morgan and Richie Dixon will have to give
much thought as to how the English will approach the game.
If I were the English I'd have my team practise ''splatter the
opponent's kidney''-type tackling, as I will have woken up by now to the
fact that I am not going to play a team that rucks all the time. Many of
those damned Scottish forwards run quite high sometimes, and might even
carry the ball in two hands, and offload it on contact, or pass it with
one hand once they've slipped the ball round my back. So I'd be thinking
of getting down low in the tackle position as they run at me -- to make
them stand up and think they have the confidence to pass -- and then . .
. whooosh . . . up into the solar plexus, and, like the Western Samoans
do, aim that bit high, above the centre of gravity, to make the player
topple backwards. Oh ya beauty.
Also, putting my English hat on, if I can insert players between the
charging Scottish forwards and their supporting players, then I will
ruin their fluidity, and I might just get a few interceptions.
I'm not, however, the English coach. The sod will have gone into it in
far greater depth than I have. But Scotland have to come up with
something a little different to beat England in a fortnight. They have
to do something, within five minutes of being on Twickenham that makes
the English players think: ''Hang on -- these Scots weren't supposed to
do that!'' Once you start thinking that on the pitch, it makes you
question your preparation.
As a country, we've been ahead of the game a few times. In the
eighties with the rucking, in the 1991 World Cup game against Western
Samoa with the body-contact stuff, and now this season with the pass out
of the tackle and constant shifting of the ball away from contact. The
Welsh players, for instance, were talking about the Scottish ''rucking''
all week before the game. The ruck now is the last resort.
We have to keep one step ahead of England, and the way to do it is to
give the players, and coaches, the time and space to get over injuries
and develop their play at Murrayfield over the whole of next weekend by
telling everyone in the squad not to play in league matches. If we
don't, then we're mugs.
As big Jill from Haddington says: ''You know, it's sometimes good to
get a break between two periods of intense physical exercise to get the
most out of yourself.'' Go on, give them the weekend off.
There will
have been
other injuries
we never
heard about,
there always
are

FRANCE will be taking a huge risk if they retain Emile N-Tamack as
their goalkicker for the World Cup in South Africa.
N-Tamack's appalling technique was not damaging on Saturday as France
finished their disappointing Five Nations with four second-half tries to
master an Ireland team that played like wooden-spoon candidates.
But when goalkicking really matters in the tight games of the World
Cup, France will -- like all other nations -- require an expert kicker
who can rattle up half a dozen penalties per match.
N-Tamack revealed himself to be an awful kicker with a couple of
penalty attempts and three missed conversions. The French backs' coach,
Guy Laporte, one of the finest striker of a rugby ball in his days, said
optimistically: ''He has everything needed to do well. He is progressing
and we will work before the World Cup.''
N-Tamack will need every second to become anywhere near a decent
kicker.
At least France banged in the tries after an inept first half when
they had the advanatge of a sharp wind.
France, mid-table finishers, missed about another four tries through
bad choices of play.
The Dad's Army element of the French team -- 33-year-old centres
Franck Mesnel and Philippe Sella and 35-year-old No.8 Marc Cecillon --
were street-wise to organise victory by keeping the ball in the hands
after half time.
But Ireland's line-out of new cap Davy Tweed and Gabriel Fulcher
thrived with a 23-13 advantage that was not exploited by the backs.
Ireland now face a whitewash unless they win in Cardiff, where their
record is encouraging.
N-Tamack's penalty was the only score of the first half. Their first
try straight from the kick-off at the start of the second half, was a
beauty, finished off by Yann Delaigue, then Cecillon flopped over from a
scrum-five by the hour. Ireland scrambled back to 15-7 with a
kick-and-chase try for Simon Geoghegan, converted by Eric Elwood.
But France killed off an exhausted defence with two tries in the
eightieth and eighty-second minutes from N-Tamack and captain Philippe
Saint-Andre, N-Tamack converting one.
Those scores brought the French try-count to 40 against only four by
Ireland since the last Irish success in 1983.

HUGH McKINLAY looks at two first division clubs with premier ambitions
IF Raith Rovers and Airdrie players meet in the street at the end of
the season, they won't greet each other. They'll put in a tackle. Not
that there is any animosity. It's just that by then, the teams will have
met on the field at least seven times during the season -- eight if next
week's Tennents Scottish Cup quarter-final at Stark's Park goes to a
replay.
It has been quite a remarkable few months for the two sides, whose
league encounter at Broadwood on Saturday suffered because of the
weather, and is scheduled to take place tonight.
At the moment, the top line is almost mind-boggling. For Raith and
Airdrie are the only two teams in Scotland who have the chance of
winning two major domestic trophies and a league title in the one
season. On top of that, Raith have booked a place in Europe next term.
Yet both management teams have one thing in common. All they want on
the bottom line is promotion to the premier division. Anything else
comes under the bonus tag.
Kirkcaldy manager Jimmy Nicholl, who watched Dundee take over
leadership of the first division again with their victory over Hamilton,
said yesterday: ''I would sacrifice everything -- even our place in
Europe -- to gain promotion.''
His reasoning is straightforward. Like many other first division
clubs, the spectre of returning to part-time football is hovering, and
this season in particular, after so many have gambled in recent years,
the price of failure will be high.
However, it does not mean to say that Raith won't be giving their best
shot on Saturday. As Nicholl said: ''The chance of having the country's
top two trophies in the boardroom to go with the league will make us
work harder to gain that treble. What an achievement that would be for a
wee club like us.'' The sigh as his thoughts momentarily strayed was a
story in itself.
Then it was back down to earth. He added: ''I know the old cliche is
about taking one game at a time and all that, but what I say to the
players is 'yes, take each game as it comes, but look what's possible at
the end of it all.' We must take the bull by the horns. It's good
motivation.''
The weather and the consequences of a fixtures pile-up, though, causes
Nicholl concern. ''I hope it does not destroy anything. I've never known
weather like it for this time of year.
''The big danger is our rivals getting their game on and putting the
points in the bag. I was up at Dundee and watched them do just that, and
Jim Duffy was a much happier man than the rest of us. That's another
reason I want tomorrow night's game to go on. It gives us a chance to
put points on the board before Dunfermline and St Johnstone meet on
Tuesday.''
The tight schedule would seem to be in Airdrie's favour, according to
assistant manager John McVeigh. ''A heavy schedule suits us. We've
already proved that this season,'' he said.
On the possibility of going the whole way in the cup, and taking the
first division title, McVeigh echoed Nicholl. ''We want promotion. It
must be promotion, especially since we are at Broadwood at the moment
and not getting as big a crowd as we had thought. Mind you, the cup
would be great as well.''
An added edge for tonight's game -- although unless there is a rapid
thaw, it must still be classed as doubtful -- is that both managers have
full squads from which to choose.
Present league positions put Raith third and Airdrie fourth behind
Dundee and Dunfermline, but with a game in hand over the Tayside men.
One more scenario to ponder -- imagine the roll call of honours at the
end of the season having Raith Rovers and Airdrie joining what looks
like Rangers and one other premier side in Europe.
Daft? Raith Rovers already proved anything is possible, haven't they?

IN what probably will be the first of many encounters between this
year's top two junior crews in Scotland, George Heriot's won the
Scottish Schools Head of the River Race on the Clyde at Glasgow Green
yesterday, beating Dumfries Academy by six seconds over the four
kilometre course.
Heriot's, who won last year, had the advantage of going off first in
the time-trial procession, with the Dumfries four going through the
timing line in second place, some 10 seconds later.
Both crews went off at a storming pace with Heriot's, at a slightly
lower stroke-rate, looking more powerful through the water.
By the halfway mark, Heriot's had managed to claw out a one-second
advantage, but the Dumfries crew began to lose power in their strokes.
Making full use of being able to see their opponents, Heriot's piled
on the pressure and opened up a gap to record a time of 14min 05sec.
The women's division was won in 17-09 by a Heriot's-Mary Erskine
school composite, with newcomers Millburn Academy of Inverness in second
place. In their first competitive season, Millburn should be happy with
this performance. Winners:
George Heriot's 14-05. Under-16 -- Dumfries Academy/St Joseph's
College 14-58. Under-15 -- George Heriot's 16-11. Women's Under-18 --
George Heriot's/Mary Erskine 17-09. Women's Under-16 -- George Heriot's
18-28.

Dundee 2, Hamilton Accies 0
ON A day when reputations were there to be blown away by the snowstorm
which all but engulfed Dundee's first-division action against Hamilton,
Jim Duffy's side still managed to reinstate themselves in pole position
for the league title.
There was disbelief among the home support when top players George
Shaw and Neil McCann were relegated to the duty of substitutes by Duffy.
Former Partick Thistle man Shaw had contributed a dozen goals to the
Taysiders' promotion challenge this season from performances which only
rarely dropped in standard below the more-than-acceptable.
And it appeared unthinkable that the highly-rated Under-21
internationalist McCann, targeted on Saturday by ever watchful
representatives of Liverpool, Blackburn, Manchester City, and Bolton,
should be asked to vacate his regular place in the line-up.
Duffy knew his selection would leave him open to criticism, but he
said: ''My job as manager is to produce results and, following recent
disappointments, I felt that neither of the two players had been doing
well. It is as simple as that.
''Only recently, I dropped another of my young players, Jim Hamilton,
and that paid off. He responded and deserved his recall for this one.
Let's hope the reactions are similar from this pair.''
Top scorer Gerry Britton, who, Duffy admitted later, was another
regular he almost axed, celebrated his reprieve with a lightning strike
against hesitant starters Hamilton.
With only two minutes on the clock, a Neil Duffy pass through a gaping
hole in the Accies defence allowed Britton the time and space to beat
Allan Ferguson from 15 yards.
What followed proved it merely was a momentary lapse by an otherwise
impressive visiting defence.
The fact that Mike Teasdale powered an angled 20-yarder in off the far
post after 71 minutes for his first strike for the club to clinch it for
Dundee, was as much to do with Hamilton's late search for an equaliser
as anything else.
As it was, Dundee created sufficient chances to win half-a-dozen
games, only to take advantage of just the two. By contrast, Accies
manager Iain Munro consoled himself with the fact that ''if the game had
been contested from 18-yard box to 18-yard box, then we would have won
it.
''However, it was clear from an early stage that Dundee wanted to win
the points an awful lot more than we did. We passed the ball about as
well as, if not better than, they did but we had no live threat where it
mattered.''
Afterwards, a slightly embarrassed Teasdale admitted: ''Happy as I am
to get my first goal for the club, I have to be honest and confirm that
my effort was meant to be a cross. I do not see any point in claiming
that it was a shot at goal when it wasn't.
''All that matters is that it helped us to take the three points
following our recent spell of disappointments. Hopefully, we have now
played ourselves out of our barren spell in time for the important later
stages of the promotion race.''
The former Elgin City star confirmed that had things worked out
differently in mid-season, he might have been assisting Caley Thistle's
campaign in the third division.
The Inverness club sought to take him back to the Highland region,
only for the 25-year-old to turn down the move. He explained: ''I
fancied staying full-time, and preferred to bide my time in the hope of
an extended first-team chance at Dens Park.''
That having been achieved, judging by top-team appearance No.21 on
Saturday, it is now clear that Jim Duffy sees Teasdale as an integral
part of a Tayside set-up geared, he hopes, for a glory finish to the
line in the promotion race.
Despite the fact that his side regained the lead in the table by
virtue of their weekend victory, it was not lost on Duffy that none of
the chasing pack was in action because of the inclement weather.

ATTADALE, who has failed to win on three outings so far and was
extremely disappointing at Haydock when trailing in a long way back, may
still take his chance at the Cheltenham Festival, it was confirmed
yesterday.
Len Lungo's stable star seemed distressed after last Saturday's race
and was examined for a possible lung infection at Edinburgh's Royal Dick
Vet College last week. He was found to be 100% fit, and Lungo remains
puzzled.
''It may have been that top weight of 12 stone on desperate ground was
too much for him, as he is not very big,'' the Carrutherstown trainer
said.
Attadale, who won three times last season, is entered for both the
#25,000 Astec Vodafone Gold Car Handicap Hurdle Final over three miles
and the #40,000 Coral Cup Handicap Hurdle over two-and-a-half miles.
''He is not going to win unless he recaptures his old form, but no
decision will be taken until nearer the time -- probably a week today,''
Lungo continued.
''He is working well at home and Hal McGhie, the owner, is keen for
him to take his chance,'' he added.
Attadale, a soft ground horse, has 10st 11lb in the Gold Card and 10-7
in the Coral. The seven-year-old has been successful over hurdles nine
times and on the Flat twice.
Sparky Gale, also trained in Dumfries-shire, is another Cheltenham
possible, although the abandonement of Kelso last Friday has upset Colin
Parker's plans.
Sparky Gale is entered for the Group 1 Sun Alliance Novices' Hurdle
and the EBF Novices' Hurdle Final, for which he won a qualifier, and a

THERE were no winners in the first-division basement battle at Stair
Park, with referee Orr perhaps the biggest loser.
He inspected the pitch 10 minutes before the start, when the playing
surface was perfect. As the game started the strong wind carried
flurries of sleet and snow, and soon the writing was on the wall. By the
break the pitch had become a sea of mud and that was that.
In what play there was, the visitors found their feet quicker, and
Barry Lavety moved well off the ball to find a good shooting position
after four minutes. However, he hesitated and Nigel Howard got in a good
tackle to kill the danger.
Martin Baker ran wide to delivery a low ball into the home box and
Davie Elliot's side-footer almost caught out Steve Ross, the home keeper
having great difficulty in smothering the ball on an already treacherous
surface.
Nigel Howard saved the day for Stranraer with a well-judged tackle,
this time on Paul McIntyre, and in 25 minutes, Stuart Taylor should have
hit the net when he was unmarked at close range but instead widely
sliced the ball away.
Taylor almost made amends 10 minutes later when he collected an Elliot
pass just outside the box and hammered in a hard, low drive. It was well
positioned away from the keeper, but just a couple of inches too far and
it caught the foot of a post and cannoned out.
Elliot then worked his way through the Stranraer defence just before
half-time but lost his way and his footing in the mud, and Ross saved.
Stranraer relied on Tommy Sloan and Lex Grant to carry their attack.
Neither had troubled Campbell Money and the home side's best chances had
come from two Graham Millar crosses which kept the Saints keeper pinned
to his line.
The travelling fans were upset by the abandonment decision and made
their feelings clear as they swarmed over stand seats to harangue police
and stewards.

EMILIO Butragueno did not offer an immediate response. He gazed over
the head of the interpreter for a few seconds before giving his reply.
''I think Scottish football is still in good health. The way they play
is very competitive and they always try to cause problems,'' he said.
It was with an apologetic shrug that the interpreter finished relaying
the Real Madrid player's answer. It was the stock response of the
foreigner who has just helped dismantle a Scottish side. Now, I don't
know about any of you, but frankly I'm sick of being patronised, of
being denied the truth because most players are too polite to dismiss
fellow professionals out of hand.
However, before he walked away, Butragueno tossed over his shoulders
another few words which, when translated, were more revealing and
honest. ''These are good qualities, but alone they are not enough.''
The Spanish internationalist was then swallowed up by a throng of
supporters who had brought Malaga's humble Rosaleda Stadium to life
while Real Madrid played with Celtic in a match arranged to help satiate
the large appetite of live television.
Butragueno had no wish to pick over the bones of Celtic's 2-0 defeat,
but from the premier division side's play he would have known Scottish
football has misplaced the qualities which give football its beauty.
If Real's style can be used as a reliable measure, the game in Spain
again is looking stunningly good and exuding an almost obscene radiance.
It makes Scottish football look ugly and ungainly.
When Butrageuno left, his place was taken by Real's manager, Jorge
Valdano, the former Argentinian internationalist, and he, too, offered a
gentle put down. ''Scottish football is fierce, but it has to use
thought processes more. It has to become more expressive,'' he said.
Tell us about it, Jorge. We watch it every week and sometimes it would
make you weep, although Tommy Burns was radiant when he entered the
post-match press conference in Malaga. His eyes were wide and alert. It
was as though he had just seen some kind of vision, and in a sense he
had. So, too, had the Celtic manager's players.
Paul McStay, John Collins, Brian O'Neil, Phil O'Donnel, and the rest
pulled off their jerseys at the end of a humbling experience and stood
waiting patiently until the Real Madrid players had finished with their
interviews for radio and television before offering exchanges. Some of
Burns' players looked genuinely grateful as they left the pitch with
their famous, all-white mementos, and this is not written to demean
Celtic. It is recorded because it is true. The Celtic people knew they
were in the presence of betters.
They had witnessed a form of greatness in the work of Real Madrid, who
won a challenge match against the premier-division side with graceful
ease. The Spanish side applied speed, touch, movement, and intelligence
to their play and Burns, honest to a fault, could do nothing other than
praise Real and admit they could have won by more than two goals if
circumstances had demanded.
''We were treated kindly,'' Burns said, ''but the way Real played the
game showed us all how it should be done. There movement was excellent
and their passing sharp and accurate.
''Every one of their players were comfortable and able to see
everything that was going on around them. These people play with an
awareness which our players don't have.''
There were times during the match when Burns looked as though he
wanted to applaud, and he now intends making sure all of his players
accept that an ability to survive in the premier division is not the
same as the real thing. However, while he is concerned mainly with the
future as it will effect his own club, the rest of us should continue to
make demands on clubs and administrators to have them do more than worry
about standards.
The SFA have set up a network of coaches which continues to widen, and
that programme must be supported, but it would be dangerous to delude
ourselves that a couple of generations down the line, Scottish football
will be overrun by talented young players. If only it were that simple.
The way Real took Celtic apart and the manner in which Barcelona and
Paris St Germain and AC Milan, who are supposed to be all washed up, and
Benfica went about their work in European Champions' Cup quarter-final
ties last midweek, provided further evidence that a force much greater
than enthusiasm is at play in countries around the world.
Even in England a culture and style is emerging and enhancing the
product as Tottenham Hotspur proved with their 6-2, extra-time win over
Southampton in the FA Cup.
The message from foreign fields has reached the English and been
deciphered, but we are still trying to break the code when, in fact, we
should listen to those who did that years ago. Listen to Barcelona's
manager Johan Cruyff when he says: ''The most difficult part of football
is analysing yourself.
''You must ask, 'what can I do, and what can't I do?' Players must be
in rhythm, thinking on the same level and only then can a manager
extract the maximum from them.
''The game has to do with quality, insight, and overview. Everyone has
certain qualities with regard to commitment, but the truly top players
have more.''
Players abroad and an increasing number in England are making game
appear ridiculously simple, and that is the sign of their greatness. On
the other hand, our players make the game look difficult and physically
demanding, which is a stark sign of their inferiority.
Foreign players are taught to think deeply about the game, but while
it is true that the majority of footballers in Scotland also think, that
is where they come unstuck. Their difficulties lie in the fact that they
think they are players.
In the outside world they are no more than imposters. They dress for
the part but they can't carry it off with any acceptable degree of
success, and generally ease back into their own environment where
deficiencies can be hidden. Soon they forget the lessons taught by
masters, and by the time another European campaign comes around, the
grand delusion again settles over them.
However, managers like Burns and Walter Smith, and Ivan Golac, if his
club, Dundee United, allow him to remain among us, will strive to teach
the children of their clubs the true art. They will work with the
potential players of tomorrow and try to make them aware of the need to
master the ball, a basic rule but one which has been ignored by many of
the professionals playing the game today.
The SFA, as has been mentioned already, have embarked on their path
which they believe will lead to a better standard of player, but
disappointment will be the end result unless old-fashioned ideals can be
implanted in the minds of the children.
There will be little to be gained by gathering groups of children at
various points around the country and teaching them for an hour or so a
week, because unless these kids have the desire to work on their own,
they will not be much better than the models they will be asked to
replace. Without daily practice the skills required to compete on level
terms will not be found.
Burns believes clubs will have to work with the best of their younger
signings on a frequent basis, but that will require major spending to
improve training facilities. The Celtic manager wants his directors to
finance the creation of a complex which would incorporate indoor and
outdoor all-weather pitches, so that coaching can go on every day and
night regardless of whether it rains or snows.
He envisages such a centre on the club's current Barrowfield training
ground, and word has it that Rangers also are looking at the possibility
of building a training complex of their own. It is believed they may
have considered a site in Lanarkshire which would also be of benefit to
the local community.
These are the sort of advances clubs and the SFA should be making, and
perhaps one day a Real Madrid player might have to employ lines like
''wonderful touch and balance . . . great awareness'' to describe
Scottish football.
It is pleasant thought, but it is better to aspire than to despair.

STRANRAER hope that their match with St Mirren, abandoned at the
interval on Saturday because of snow, will be re-run this weekend -- and
the club have approach the league for permission.
And the good news for the fans is that the Stair Park side aim to
allow the fans in without paying for that game.
''As the game lasted until the interval the fans did not get their
money back,'' said manager Alex McAnespie. ''But we understand the
economic situation and that fans have to work hard for their money.
''We don't want to make off them in a situation like this. Like all
clubs we could do with money, but we also want to be fair. We value the
support of the fans more than the need for extra money, and we will
allow them in free when the game is played again.''
With the game scoreless, referee Bobby Orr decided that the match
could not continue at the start of the second half. However, Saints
manager Jimmy Bone thought otherwise.
''I felt that if we had started we should have finished,'' he said.
''The conditions were no worse. The referee said he was concerned about
the safety of the players, but the physios had not been on.''
But Stranraer's McAnespie agreed with the decision.
* AIRDRIE and Raith Rovers, who meet in the Scottish Cup on Saturday,
will try tonight to play their league match snowed off on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Scottish League officials get down today to planning a
catch-up on fixtures hit by the winter weather. But any more call-offs
could mean that some clubs may be playing midweek in April. Re-scheduled
matches this week are:
Tuesday. Premier division -- Motherwell v Falkirk (7.45), Partick
Thistle v Dundee United. First division -- Clydebank v Ayr. Second
division -- Morton v Clyde, Stenhousemuir v Berwick. Third division --
East Stirling v Albion Rovers, Forfar v Montrose.
Wednesday. Second division -- Meadowbank v Stirling Albion.
Saturday. First division -- Dunfermline v St Johnstone, Stranraer v St
Mirren (provisional).

HERALD sports boxing coverage spans the globe. Our man Jim Reynolds in
Atlantic City for the Gary Jacobs fight. Our man Jim Traynor in downtown
Livingston for the world title fight involving Naz Whatsisname, the
Sheffield Asian hopeful in the kilt and leopardskin shorts.
If this were not enough, the Sporting Diary took ourselves to the Time
Capsule, Coatbridge. We travelled to Buckfast County to sample boxing at
its corinthian level, the Scottish Amateur Boxing Association
championships.
The amateur side of the noble art of self defence -- where money is
not at stake but where man meets man in an ultimate test of fitness and
courage.
This was our first opportunity to observe amateur boxing at close hand
and we must report that it looks just as painful and bloody as the
professional code. The event at the Time Capsule was the eliminator
rounds for the Scottish championships. We arrived in time to see a very
large chap from Perth eliminating his opponent in the heavyweight
division with a mighty punch which spread his bloody nose across his
face and his body across the canvas.
We must confess to taking refuge from the punching by slipping off to
other parts of the Time Capsule. Just up from the gym where the boxing
was going on, for instance, we found the Serpent Bar, adjacent to the
jungle-style swimming pool which is a feature of the Coatbridge sport
and fun complex.
Back in the gym, it is shades of the Colisseum in Rome with a
programme of 50 contests held in two rings. So what's the attraction for
the boxers, we ask Walter McGowan, former world champion and here at
Coatbridge in his capacity as a coach with the Phoenix boxing club in
Motherwell.
''When a boxer is at the peak of his mental and physical fitness,
there is no greater high. You feel you can take on anyone,'' says
Walter. ''At the amateur level, we are teaching these boys
self-confidence and discipline. You'll rarely see a boxer getting
involved in a street fight.''
Peter Moore, exective member of the SABA, reminds us that boxing still
performs the important role of keeping boys off the streets. For every
registered boxer, there are three or four other kids in the clubs who
will never make it but are still kept involved.
* FROM boxing we move to Junior football. Not much change there: some
say junior football is the strongest argument for banning boxing.
A Nae Luck Award to Larkhall Royal Albert for setting what must be an
unenviable football record. The official details of the club's last home
game read: Attendance 1; receipts #1.50.'' This apparently brings the
Junior club's turnstile revenue for the season up to #80.
* THE unmistakeable tones of David Francey, legendary sports
commentator of yore, are once again gracing the airwaves. David is to be
heard of a Monday evening on Radio 5 Live's documentary series Voices of
the Old Firm.
Judging by the first episode, Mr Francey is adept as ever for not
letting detail get in the way of a bit of purple prose. ''All roads lead
to Govan,'' he intoned. ''Home of the Rangers and of the famous John
Brown shipyard.'' Close enough. John Brown does play for Rangers, and is
made of steel.
* THE Diary was in conversation with Hugh Adam, supremo of the Rangers
pools and therefore a bit of an expert on games of chance. Hugh had been
pondering the relative statistics for winning the top prize in the
National Lottery compared to your chances of dying in any given week.
''Do you know you are 1500 times more likely to die than you are to
scoop the Lottery?'' he asks. It's being so cheerful that keeps Hugh
going.
* CELTIC fans purchasing tickets for the club's Grand National raffle
will be over the moon, no doubt, to see the briefs were printed by a
company with an address in Prince William Road, Loughborough.
* THE sport of volleyball, like football, can be plagued by abandoned
matches. What, indoors, we hear you ask? Yes, like one of this weekend's
results in the Royal Bank League -- Telford 2, Westerhailes 1 (match
abandoned, hall let ran out).
A volleyball match, being the best of five sets, can last from an hour
to 2[1/2] hours and some games just never go the distance. It's called
not incurring the wrath of the jannie.

THE Scotsmen from Bath -- ''the BBs'' as Gavin Hastings calls them --
had every right to lead the celebrations on Saturday night, Eric Peters
and David Hilton both making their international try-scoring debuts.
Peters' touchdown, which was born deep in the Scottish 22, is already a
leading contender for the Try of the Year award.
Born in Glasgow, the big No.8 is 26, and seems to have grown in
stature since his first cap against Canada in January. A former
Cambridge University captain, he works as a chartered surveyor in Bath,
but is still not able to command a regular place in his club's first XV.
''I was lurking about the halfway line when the move began,'' he
related. ''Gavin passed to Doddie Weir, who did really well to draw in
Ieuan Evans before giving the ball to Kenny Logan.
''The other week I had watched a television clip of Kenny playing for
Stirling County and he had cut inside. I made up my mind to make for the
middle of the field in case he did it again.
''He gave me the ball and the defence just opened up. It was a
wonderful feeling.''
For his part, Logan was astonished to find Peters at his elbow.
''He is the first back-row man who has ever been able to predict what
I will do. Most of the time I don't know myself.''
Weir, who had his best performance in a Scotland shirt, admitted he
had been more nervous before the match than in any of his 25 previous
appearances. ''I knew I was only there because Damian Cronin was injured
and I was determined to prove worthy of the occasion.''
David Hilton is a Bath butcher, working with his father and mother in
the family business. ''I am trying to remember when I last scored a
try,'' he confessed.
Gavin told the post-match dinner that the prop had gone over ''from a
foot and a half out,'' but Hilton did not care. ''That was the best
moment of my life,'' he declared.
David, whose grandfather Walter hails from Edinburgh, turned down a
chance to join the South-West England squad in order to pursue his
Scotland claims. ''That was one smart decision,'' he reflected.
Hastings Sr was unaware that his 16 points had taken him to another
record. He is now the first British player to have scored more than 600
points in major internationals -- he has 538 for Scotland, and 66 for
the British Lions.
That makes him third on the world list behind Michael Lynagh of
Australia (821) and Grant Fox of New Zealand (645).
''I am not all that concerned about records,'' he said. ''What really
pleased me today was the Murrayfield crowd -- when Eric Peters scored,
there was an explosion of noise.
''Who would have thought we would be going to Twickenham with the big
prize within our grasp? We will give it our best shot.''
Brother Scott was just delighted to be back in the colours. And while
Gavin is expected to retire after the World Cup, the younger Hastings
has no such intentions.
''I will be playing again next season,'' declared the 30-year-old,
''because I still think I have something to offer.
''What I will be attempting to do at Twickenham is establish my place
in the World Cup squad.''
Damian Cronin scotched any rumours that he would not be fit for the
World Cup. He is taking his damaged elbow to Lillieshall for treatment
today and expects to be ready to go with Scotland to Spain in early May.
The Welsh, the current Five Nations' champions, were gracious in
defeat. Ieuan Evans said: ''After three minutes I thought this was a
simple game -- then you taught us a lesson.
''I give you my very, very, very best wishes for Twickenham and I hope
you spoil England's pre-Grand Slam party.''
WRU president Sir Tasker Watkins went even further. ''I have nothing
particular against the English. It is a fact, none the less, that the
whole of the rest of the world hopes that you beat them.''
I shook hands with Neil Kinnock, by the way!
He gave me
the ball and
the defence
just opened
up. It was a
wonderful
feeling

YOU can recognise the species immediately. The Lesser Known Sporting
Peacock. Their natural habitat is the golf course where, because of
their number, they are sometimes difficult to spot.
Why is it that men who are sober suited and businesslike during the
week feel the urge to turn up for their Saturday medal in clothes which
may have been designed by Coco Chanel, but which wouldn't look out of
place on Coco the Clown?
All too often it is the ones who have been to too many business
lunches who plump for the lurid, diamond-patterned jerseys, the Ancient
Scottish Dumpling tartan trousers, and the ridiculous hats with pom poms
in the mistaken belief that just by wearing these clothes, they are
somehow going to be transformed into another Tom Watson or Nick Faldo.
They bristle with emblems and logos that would have you believe
they've played on most courses from Palm Springs to Sunningdale.
All is well until they strut down the fairway, usually from one side
to the other, and it becomes apparent that their money would have been
better spent on lessons with the professional -- such as how to hold
their clubs.
But it is not just the clothes. Equipment also is part of the act.
Many grassrooters seem to believe that if you have the best and most
extensive equipment for a sport you will, by osmosis, be guaranteed
success.
Consequently, at every golf club there is always someone who has just
bought a new set of clubs that will knock five strokes off their
handicap overnight. They pin their hopes on an inordinately expensive,
big-headed driver or a new fangled putter. Sadly, the variable many
ignore is ability.
Of course, golf is not the only sport where preening is rife. Tennis
has come a long way since the days when pure white T-shirts and shorts
were mandatory.
One of my first encounters with Percy Peacock was at a tennis
tournament. I tentatively put in an open entry for the mixed doubles,
and when I turned up for the first-round tie, a man bounded up and
introduced himself as Denis from Perth (name and address changed to
protect the guilty).
He was brimming with confidence, had six pristine racquets under an
arm to my one battered Maxply, and was absolutely certain of victory.
Such was his self belief that I thought we were invincible. Until we got
on the court. That was when I learned that appearances can be deceptive.
My partner would have been at a loss to hit the ball over the net
twice in a row, and his speed about the court was akin to Tommy the
Tortoise. Undaunted, he shook hands after our inevitable defeat and went
on to a career as an umpire.
Even spectators have to conform at some sports. To be seen without a
waxed jacket at Murrayfield is to flirt with the social wilderness, an
MCC tie is essential to avoid any stigma at Lords, and a trilby and
camel-hair coat are standard for a day at the races.
Mind you, there is a serious and disturbing side to this compulsion
over sports clothing. Such is the kudos attached to the right style that
there have been countless incidents in America, and some here, in which
children have been mugged just for a pair of expensive trainers.
The commercial instinct and the chance to make a quick buck has led to
many football clubs cashing in on their success. Strips have become a
fashion accessory. Manchester United have had so many changes that the
players must be suffering from an identity crisis, and Scotland, it
seems, have had as many strips as goals for in recent years. The cost is
astronomical for parents forced to provide the current strip to keep a
would-be Ryan Giggs happy.
The merchandising boom has also spread to T-shirts, and during the
last World Cup, one was manufactured to pay homage to the man known as
St Jack in Ireland. It featured a picture of Jack Charlton meeting the
Pope in Italia '90, with the caption: ''Who's that with our Jack?''
Jasper Conran has just finished designing costumes for Scottish
Ballet's latest production of Swan Lake. He might be advised to stay on
as there's bound to be plenty of business at the major Scottish football
clubs where so many players appear to have had only ballet training.
Of course, sometimes this rampant commercialism can backfire. Recently
I passed a sports shop which had a large pile of lilac strips on offer
at half price. Something to do with a failed European campaign,
apparently.

THAT uplifting Scottish performance against Wales that clearly owed a
lot to wonderful crowd support gave further encouraging examples of how
the Scottish style is developing towards more variety and less
predictability. Not only is that proving successful but also more
entertaining to watch and, surely, to play.
It stood to reason that, as Wales fielded a new full back playing his
first international as an original choice in Matthew Back, and as he has
proved an adventurous counter-attacker with his club, Bridgend, the
Scots would want to search him out with some high-level bombing in order
to damage his confidence while permitting him no fodder with which he
might have a tilt out of the deep.
That worked like a charm, because Craig Chalmers had regained the
accuracy to his garryowen punting to set alongside the thunderous
follow-up running of Scott Hastings and the entire Scottish
loose-forward trio. That was one of the best pinpoint bombing
performances ever by Chalmers. Bryan Redpath also played a part.
That surely will be an important tactic against England at Twickenham
on March 18, because Mike Catt, their full back, who really is a
converted stand-off, has not been thus tested to any degree by Ireland,
France, or Wales.
One of the reasons for that, of course, is England's ability to
dominate possession through their very big pack. Pressure cannot be
applied to Catt unless the requisite quality of ball comes off the
assembly line.
But whereas, in the past, big punts and crash balls have formed the
staple diet in Scotland's attack strategy, Douglas Morgan and Richie
Dixon clearly have encouraged a fuller repertoire that encompasses a
higher percentage of handling in proportion to punting.
That was apparent in the move leading to that Eric Peters try. Not
since Cardiff 1982 have the Scots put together such a devastating
counter-attack. It was a score that carried a French brand.
Not so very long ago that speculative punt by Wayne Proctor would have
been hammered to touch or back upfield as part of the ping-pong process.
Indeed not so long before, in similar circumstances, Scotland's
captain, with Kenny Logan handy, yet found a good touch. How encouraging
then that, second time round, Gavin Hastings, thinking on his feet, made
a different assessment in sensing a counter-attack opportunity. He
called on Rob Wainwright to shift it by hand and then himself sent
Doddie Weir on to splendid linkage to Logan.
The Stirling County wing is undoubtably quicker this season, which is
one reason why he is such a confident runner. The score also underlined
how Peter Wright's game has widened in that he was close enough in
support to have accepted the scoring pass had that been necessary.
The range of Scottish attack preparation was evident also in a
marvellous sequence that ended with a Logan touchdown on the opposite
wing being disallowed. From a Peters scrummage pick-up, Iain Morrison
had detached to the open side to support wide out a rippling bout of
handling involving Redpath, Chalmers, Scott Hastings, Townsend on a
loop, Logan, Gavin Hastings, Chalmers, Scott Hastings, and Logan. The
Peters pick-up delayed the initial Welsh open-side defence and, but for
a fractional forward pass, that would have been another high-quality
score.
One more diversion was given to Scotland's pattern by the number of
times either Chalmers or Redpath cut back or through enemy lines, thus
asking contrasting questions of the Welsh defence while also lighting
the touch-paper to further Scottish forward advances. The Melrose halves
each made a couple of darts in the continuous sequence leading to the
David Hilton score, and Chalmers drew from Phil Bennett the accolade of
being the best support-running stand-off in the game.
0  Whether Scotland can wrest enough quality ball from all faces at
Twickenham in order to ring the changes in their ploys remains to be
seen, but clearly they are now more difficult to plan against because
they are prepared to strike on different fronts, and so far they have
kept the attack speed of Craig Joiner under wraps.

LAZIO striker Giuseppe Signori was missing yesterday when Fiorentina
visited Rome, but the home fans certainly did not miss the little man as
his replacement, Pierluigi Casiraghi, scored four times in the capital
side's 8-2 victory.
Paolo Negro, Alen Boksic, Marco Di Vaio, and Roberto Cravero also were
on target as Lazio produced a superb display of attacking play.
Goals from Gianfranco Zola and Dino Baggio gave Parma a 2-0 win at
Torino to narrow the gap on league leaders Juventus, held to a goalless
draw at Inter.
Lazio's city rivals Roma, without injured Daniel Fonseca and suspended
Giuseppe Giannini, had Francesco Moriero sent off as they stumbled 3-0
at Sampdoria, while Marco Simone struck four times as AC Milan beat
bottom-of-the-table Brescia 5-0.
The reigning champions moved into fifth place on 36 points, one ahead
of Sampdoria and Cagliari, who stretched their unbeaten run to eight
matches with a 2-1 win over Bari.

PERHAPS Fort William fancy themselves as the Raith Rovers of the
north. The Lochaber side have had some memorable days since joining the
Highland League in 1985, but only on Saturday did they secure their
first place in a senior cup final.
By beating Brora Rangers 2-1 in a semi-final replay they reached the
McEwan's North Cup final at Forres later this month. They meet
Lossiemouth, who have not won a trophy for 35 years. Truly this is the
year of the underdog.
Tom Drummond and Finlay Shearer, brother of Scotland striker Duncan,
scored to give Fort only their second win at Brora. Jocky MacKay pulled
one back.
Meanwhile, Caledonian Thistle are on the trail of Fort's former
Aberdeen striker, Iain Polworth. The merged club freed Polworth a year
ago but will have to pay to bring him back if they are to move before
this month's signing deadline.
Huntly kept alive their prospects of a second consecutive North treble
by reaching the final of the Jarlaw Aberdeenshire Cup. A Brian Thomson
double and an Eddie Copland strike completed a 3-0 semi-final replay win
at home to Fraserburgh.
In the Highland League, Cove Rangers extended their unbeaten run to 11
with a 7-0 rout of Deveronvale. Alan Leslie hit a hat trick, with Mike
Beattie (2), Dave Caldwell, and a Stephen Rattray own goal completing
Vale's misery.
Departing Elgin City manager Ian Fleming steered his men to a 3-1 win
at Buckie Thistle before handing over the reins to assistant Neil
Mackintosh. Hugh McLachlan, Duncan Ord, and Ross McHardy netted for
City.
Stuart MacKay gave Clach the lead, but David Keith and Grant Coull
replied to give Peterhead a 2-1 win, while Kevin Will, Neil Thomson,
John Wilson, and a Neil Esson own goal gave Keith a 4-0 home win against
Rothes.

UEFA are set to discuss plans to re-structure the Cup-winners' and
UEFA Cups along similar lines to the Champions' League format.
Clubs still involved in the latter stages of both competitions have
been asked to attend a conference in Geneva on Friday to ascertain the
mood for change.
There is no doubt that the success of the Champions' League has
diminished the importance of the other two events and dwarfed their
income, and now UEFA believe that by changing the set-ups, extra finance
could be raised.
That need was recognised at the weekend, when Anderlecht, Belgium's
dominant club, agreed to donate part of its profits from the Champions'
League to a common-good fund designed to help less fortunate rivals.
The combined debts of all professional clubs in Belgium stands at #60m
and the country's oldest club, Liege, faces extinction. Jacques de Nolf,
secretary of Bruges, said: ''An important principle has now been
established.
''If, for instance, Anderlecht win the championship this season, we
will never be able to compete financially again because of the profits
from the Champions' League.
''It is a problem in small countries where one rich club is becoming
richer and the rest weaker. It becomes easier all the time for them to
win the league, which is not good for football.''
* NEVER a week passes without Berti Vogts suffering another blow to
his beleaguered regime.
The German coach's decision to make Jurgen Klinsmann captain in place
of the injured Lothar Matthaeus has gone down badly with Jurgen Kohler.
So, too, did his decision to omit Stuttgart's Thomas Berthold from the
recent friendly against Spain.
Juventus defender Kohler, rated as one of the best man-markers in the
world and capped 73 times for Germany, said: ''It has been a life-time
ambition to lead my country. But now Vogts hands it to a forward instead
of a defender. Worse still, the honour goes to a player who could not
live in my shadow.''
For his part, Berthold has warned that he will quit the national side
if he is not selected for Germany's next game.
* AUSTRIA'S coach Herbert Prohaska has had his problems. Before two
games last week between the national team and his B side, he declared
that the best men would be foremost in his plans.
After two wins by the B-men -- 3-1 and 7-2 -- Prohaska faces the
embarrassing task of dropping many of his established stars.
* DUTCH coach Arie Haan has learned why there is a UEFA ban on his
club, PAOK Saloniki, competing in Europe for another two years because
of crowd trouble.
Haan, who has announced his intention to resign, revealed: ''Since
coming to Greece this season, there has not been one game which has not
been stopped at least three times because of incidents involving our
supporters or directors.
''It only takes one bad decision and they go crazy and attack the
referee. Never have I seen behaviour like this. I've had enough.''
* SWEDISH internationalist Henryk Larssen, the only player this season
to have scored in every leg and European tie, has rejected a new
contract with Feyenoord.
The striker, who has scored seven goals in the Dutch side's UEFA Cup
challenge, is now wanted in Spain and Italy.
* THE French FA has banned Bastia's Laurent Moracchini until August
because of his third violent offence of the season. His latest
altercation broke an opponent's jaw in a cup game against Guincamp.
* IF BAYERN Munich are to progress in the Champions' Cup, they must do
it without Jean-Pierre Papin. The French striker, plagued by a knee
injury, has been ruled out for the rest of the season.
* LOGRONES, bottom of the Spanish first division, have dismissed their
third manager this season. Jose Augusto has been replaced by Antonio
Ruiz.

NEITHER of England's two European Cup-winners' Cup representatives had
a happy derby day in London yesterday.
Don Hutchison earned West Ham a priceless boost in their relegation
battle and sentenced Arsenal -- held to a 1-1 draw by the Frenchmen of
Auxerre on Thursday -- to their first defeat under caretaker-manager
Stewart Houston with the only goal at Highbury. Meanwhile Chelsea,
defeated by Bruges of Belgium in midweek, had to be content with a point
from a grim goalless draw with Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge.
Hutchison swooped for his sixth goal of the season in 20 minutes after
John Moncur put the ball through the legs of John Jensen and Nigel
Winterburn following a return pass from Tony Cottee.
Dutchman Glenn Helder and 21-goal Ian Wright were almost totally
ineffective against West Ham's diligent marking, with the #2.3m winger
being taken off before the end.
It was only the second win in eight league games for the Hammers and
yet another example of bungling Arsenal's inability to hit the target at
Highbury -- they have not scored more than one goal in a league match at
home since the middle of October.
West Ham's victory lifted them to fourth from bottom, leapfrogging
Palace, who won a point on a ground where they last won 13 years ago.
Stamford Bridge has been the scene of many classic clashes over the
years. This wasn't one of them.
Palace's Andy Preece came nearest to breaking the stalemate, flashing
a thirtieth-minute left-foot drive against a post.
Mark Stein squandered a golden chance during Chelsea's best period in
the second half. Gavin Peacock's superb through pass in 65 minutes was
perfect for Eddie Newton, who stabbed the ball forward for Stein to
shoot from 10 yards -- but his shot ended up in row H.

ONE of the arguments advanced in favour of Blackburn Rovers preventing
Manchester United from annexing a third successive Premiership title has
been that their superior goal difference was worth an extra point.
So it was until Saturday afternoon, when United set about Ipswich Town
at Old Trafford to such irresistible effect that the previous record
Premier League victories (7-1 by Aston Villa, Blackburn, and Newcastle)
were left behind with 25 minutes still to play.
In that remaining period, United took the margin of Ipswich's
humiliation to 9-0, a ''once-in-a-lifetime experience'' for their
manager, Alex Ferguson.
Andy Cole cannot hope to match it too often, either, since he is
claiming five of the goals, including one originally credited as an own
goal. ''I've been kicked ever since I came here,'' Cole said, not making
it clear whether he was referring to opponents or critics, ''but I've
got self-belief.''
Kenny Dalglish, as was to be expected, was unconcerned by the news
from Old Trafford, preferring to concentrate on his own team's
achievement in clinging on for a 1-0 success at Aston Villa after
Scotland's Colin Hendry scored early on.
There was much clinging to do as well, some of it with the sort of
grim determination that makes champions, but at the end of it all
Blackburn, despite having a goal difference two worse than United, still
lead them by three points.
The other members of the top six were thrown together in what might
have been termed UEFA Cup qualification matches. Liverpool (fourth)
deservedly beat Newcastle (third) 2-0, cutting the gap between them to a
single win with two games in hand and quelling talk that Kevin Keegan's
team could yet turn the championship into a three-horse race.
For all their success since Cole left them (one defeat in 11 games
before Saturday), it would be over-optimistic for Newcastle to think of
anything other than qualifying for Europe -- and, of course, the FA Cup,
in which they visit Everton for a quarter-final tie next weekend.
Whoever finishes fifth should be looking at a European place, too, in
something other than the much-criticised Inter-Toto Cup.
Nottingham Forest, held 2-2 by Tottenham on Saturday, are four points
ahead of them, having played two games more. It was a bizarre game,
meandering towards a 0-0 draw with only 11 minutes left, before a sudden
torrent of goals. Mercifully it seems that, while increasing Tottenham's
efficiency, Gerry Francis has not greatly reduced their traditional
capacity to entertain, so evident earlier in the week in their thrilling
6-2 FA Cup win at Southampton.
Home defeats for Villa and Wimbledon (3-1 by QPR) were a reminder to
them that any of the bottom 13 teams could yet be involved in the
dog-fight to avoid dropping into the Endsleigh League.
Rangers were the only side in the bottom half of the table to win on
Saturday, which had the effect of moving them out of the bottom six,
just, at the expense of Everton. Duncan Ferguson's second sending-off in
two months was a costly one, reducing them to nine men (Vinny Samways
having preceded him down the tunnel), after which bottom-of-the-table
Leicester retrieved a two-goal deficit to draw.

Kilmarnock 2, Dundee Utd 0
IT TOOK about five minutes to know which team would be collecting
three points. Peering through the snow, shivering in our seats,
wondering what in God's name we were doing there, we could see that
Dundee United felt exactly the same.
The majority of their players clearly thought that a curtain of
freezing snow, a pitch that was already turning muddy and stubborn, and
a ball that consequently refused to behave according to natural law,
made up a package that was not designed for playing football.
Kilmarnock, on the other hand, maybe didn't even notice it was
snowing. There they were, tearing about with a determination that
indicated they were out to play for the afternoon and would have been
prepared to manoeuvre around snow ploughs if necessary. Before five
minutes had gone they had created at least three chances, had the United
defence in disarray, and had their own crowd feeling better, if not
exactly warmed up.
It may have been unfair, but the impression was distinct that the
Tannadice lads had made up their minds that the game would never be
completed . . . why get excited when we will be in the bath before 4.0?
. . . but by the second half they had realised the madness was to be
carried to a conclusion. By then it was too late. The busy-bodies in the
Killie shirts had finished them off with two goals and a clear
superiority that was never going to be bridged in the conditions.
United's manager, Ivan Golac, had elected to play both Jerren Nixon,
who hails from Trinidad, and Sergio, the striker from Brazil. Neither
may have seen snow, let alone played in it.
Golac had hoped that the ball skills of these two would be especially
useful in the conditions, but the lads from warmer climes were not the
boys for this job. At least they had heritage to use as an excuse,
unlike some of the others in the United side who seemed to be thinking
of other things, like next weekend's cup meeting with Hearts.
Kilmarnock have a cup date, too, with Celtic, but they paid heed to
the warnings of their manager, Alex Totten, to concentrate on league
points. His men obeyed his call with an energy that must have exceeded
even his expectations.
''A most professional performance,'' he called it, ''and it was done
with what might be the youngest team in the premier division.''
Steve Maskrey, 34, did nothing to lower the average age, but he did
contribute a great deal to the victory. Maskrey has the engine of a
player 10 years younger and it was that perpetual motion which, allied
to the shooting power of Ally Mitchell, proved too much for United.
Mitchell had already threatened down the right before he struck with the
opening goal in seven minutes, and he did it again just before half-time
with a second goal which slipped under Kelham O'Hanlon's body.
Neither O'Hanlon nor Killie keeper, Dragoje Lekovic, looked happy all
afternoon but in the swirling snow and unpredictable surface that was
not at all surprising.
Only the ever-willing Maurice Malpas -- even although he made more
errors than usual -- Christian Dailly, and Jim McInally looked in the
mood for United.
0 Maskrey, whose career was rescued by Totten, his former manager at
St Johnstone from whom he was signed last August, has suffered from a
series of injuries but admitted that at Perth the new manager ''didn't
fancy me'' and knew he needed a fresh chance. He has taken it well
enough to be chosen as Player of the Month for February and has
established himself as a favourite at Rugby Park.
''I was just happy to get the chance here. When you get that chance
you have to take it.''
He and his mates have moved up the table to fifth from the bottom and
will go into the cup-tie in good heart. They are a tough side to beat in
any competition.

SECOND DIVISION
YOU would rather have had Hugh Ward's kind of day at Methil on
Saturday than that experienced by goalkeeper Ewan Wilson.
The contrast was equally marked for their clubs, with the 2-0 victory
taking Dumbarton to the top of the second division whereas defeat surely
ended any serious promotion hopes for East Fife.
The game was almost halfway to a neutral outcome when Wilson and Ward
featured in an incident that was to symbolise their contrasting
fortunes. Right on half-time, Wilson miskicked the ball and the
Dumbarton striker tapped it in to the empty net.
Wilson's misery was complete with 15 minutes to go when he pulled down
substitute Colin McKinnon in the box. His reward was a red card, and the
only blemish of the day for Dumbarton was that Martin Mooney's penalty
was saved by replacement keeper Dean Robertson.
However, Ward's day was not yet over. He improved his scoring record
with a 20-yard drive that gave him the distinction of having scored in
the final minute of each half.
Steve Archibald's team are stranded seven points behind the side in
fourth place, Berwick Rangers, who gained some consolation for cup
elimination at the hands of Meadowbank.
A Warren Hawke header from a Kevin Kane corner -- the striker's
twelfth goal of the season -- was the only score of a game that the home
side would have won more convincingly but for missed chances and good
goalkeeping by Steve Ellison.
The promotion outsiders must somehow overtake three clubs out of the
top quartet and Stirling Albion, like East Fife, have a seven-point gap
to make up on Berwick after a 2-1 defeat at Brechin.
In conditions approaching a blizzard at times, a Gavin Price header
set up Ralph Brand in the first half.
Albion had defender Ronnie McQuilter sent off with quarter of an hour
left but they seemed to have salvaged a point when Willie Watters hit
his tenth goal of the season. However, the bottom club's revival was
completed through a Price shot eight minutes from time. Brechin are now
only one point behind Meadowbank.
Forfar
to the
four yet
again
THIRD DIVISION
IN THE past couple of seasons Forfar have made a habit of wasting a
good start to their league campaigns, but they have reasons to be
hopeful that the current one will have a happy ending.
Saturday's 4-2 win over second-placed Ross County extended the home
side's lead to eight points and maintained their unbeaten record at
Station Park. It was their second successive four-goal performance.
David Bingham found the target after only five minutes and a shot from
a Paul Hannigan cross brought his total for the season to 13. However,
within three minutes that tally was matched by County's Brian Grant, who
headed in a Billy Ferries cross.
A Hannigan lob restored the margin before County's Andy MacLeod
wheeled and shot in to make the score 3-2 after only 33 minutes.
Forfar made certain of the points in the final minute when Ian
McPhee's punt was missed by keeper Steve Hutchison and Sandy Ross rolled
the ball into an empty net.
County are still well placed for promotion, but fellow newcomers Caley
Thistle seem to have too much to do even after Saturday's 3-1 home win
over Cowdenbeath.
Defender Mark McAllister and Norman MacMillan gave the Inverness side
a useful lead, but four minutes after the break Amando de Mello cut the
leeway. A 20-yard shot by Colin Mitchell clinched the points for the
home team.
Arbroath beat Albion Rovers 2-0 in a fixture switched from Coatbridge
to Gayfield, and that fourth successive win under new manager John
Brogan took the home side above Queen's Park into third-bottom place.
David Pew and Barry Scott were the scorers.

Celtic 2, Aberdeen 0
ABERDEEN plunged still deeper into crisis yesterday. And the penalty
decision which sent them towards yet another defeat underlined just how
the breaks can go against a struggling team.
The award by referee Andrew Waddell -- who seems to strut happily hand
in hand with controversy -- was a soft one. It looked that way when it
was given, and the feeling was endorsed by television replays.
Giant Dutchman Pierre Van Hooydonk was presumed to be the victim of a
push in the back from Brian Irvine. Whatever anyone else thought,
Waddell gave the penalty and the Dutchman scored.
Then, late in the game, the #1.2m buy from Holland added a second to
take Waddell partially off the hook.
These goals ended a run of four games without a win for Celtic in the
premier division, and it was only their third in their past 21 league
games.
The goals also emphasised the plight the Pittodrie team now find
themselves in.
You must presume that when the television planners decided on this
game for a live showing, they expected a meaningful clash between two
major teams.
Instead they found themselves with two starring clubs who have known
better times scrapping it out in front of just more than 20,000 fans --
a far cry indeed from the momentous clashes of the not-so-distant past.
This was Celtic's lowest gate of the season. And it was close to 9000
down on the first time the two clubs met at Hampden in their first
premier meeting of the season.
It was sad to see the rows of empty seats, and to realise that the
major interest in the outcome was not the title, but only how far
Aberdeen would become embroiled in the relegation struggle.
That penalty, when it arrived, stemmed a rising tide of boos and jeers
from the unhappy fans.
Paul McStay had started the game, and as skipper at that. This time it
was the turn of international colleague John Collins to sit things out
with a place on the substitutes' bench.
It was Celtic who pushed forward most at the start of the game, but
somehow they were unable to make things happen at that early stage. In
31 minutes, however, keeper Michael Watt had to hurl himself along his
line to smother a drive from Tosh McKinlay. Soon afterwards, Watt raced
from his line to block a shot from Phil O'Donnell.
Then came the controversial penalty four minutes before half-time. Van
Hooydonk scored, and Aberdeen perhaps realised that nothing was going
right for them.
They might have changed things in the second half as they tried to
come back -- but they failed.
In 54 minutes, youngster Stephen Glass beat Tommy Boyd out on the
left, and then whipped a cross over the face of the goal. Joe Miller
reached it first and smacked a header against the face of the bar.
There was another chance just three minutes later when Billy Dodds
crossed from the right. Eoin Jess rose to challenge Pat Bonner, the
keeper dropped the ball, and Boyd hooked it away just short of the line.
Then in 71 minutes, Bonner redeemed himself with a world-class save.
Duncan Shearer had replaced Jess, and when Stephen Wright crossed from
the right, the powerful striker sent in a header which Bonner stopped
with his legs on the goal-line.
By now, too, John Collins had replaced Brian McLaughlin after 60
minutes to add some more urgency to Celtic's play.
Twelve minutes from the end, it was McKinlay who made ground down the
left and then set up a chance for the second decisive goal. His cross
drifted way over to the far post, and Van Hooydonk was there
unchallenged to touch a header into the net.
Although Billy Dodds did have the ball in the net for Aberdeen four
minutes later, that was disallowed for offside as if to sum up
Aberdeen's afternoon.
Beforehand, manager Roy Aitken had hoped that the presence of the
television cameras would lift his players, just as it did three weeks
ago when he took over as caretaker for the first time in the clash with
Rangers at Pittodrie.
Then the players had responded to the challenge and handed the new man
a victory. Yesterday they were unable to do it. The penalty blow
certainly dented whatever confidence they may have left.
Clearly Aitken has problems. Just as clearly, they have not been of
his making.
Aberdeen are playing as if they are a team doomed to face at least a
play-off in any attempt to stay in the top division.
They have been offered a #5000-a-man bonus to stay up. Yesterday there
were few signs that, even with that kind of cash on offer, the players
have the ability and the commitment to pull themselves clear of the
danger zone they have now lived in for too long.

INVESTORS hoping for a big killing on their National Power and
PowerGen shares when dealings in the part-paid units begin today are
likely to be disappointed.
The Government has priced the new shares well above last week's stock
market level of the existing shares, so ruling out a large premium.
Including the 10p discount incentive, the new National Power units have
been pitched at 476p on a fully paid basis, 20p above Friday's market
quote. New PowerGen shares are 512p, against 492p in the market.
The sale was oversubscribed 1.6 times and only those applying for up
to 500 shares will receive all they wanted.
It is normal for part-paid shares to command a premium because holders
get full ownership while not having to complete payment for another 18
months in this case.
But the new shares have been priced to eliminate part of this premium,
leaving the possibility of perhaps a 10% premium in the part-paid shares
for small investors.
In the comparable BT3 sale 18 months ago, the new shares were priced
almost exactly the same as the existing units so there was a premium
ranging up to 20% when the part-paid shares began trading, even though
demand was less than for the electricity generators.
The second instalment for the electricity shares is the same as the
first and the third and final instalment has now been set at 136p per
National Power and 142p per PowerGen, both due in September 1996.
The Government's advisers say that allocations have been pitched so
that half of all applicants will receive all they requested. Those who
asked for 600 will get 550; 700, 600; 800, 675; 900, 650; 1000, 700 and
2000, 1050.
In the retail tender offer all PEPs bids have been met in full and of
the other bids those for more than 400 will receive none.
The public offer was increased from 40% to 51.3% of the total as a
result of clawback from the institutional offer, which was heavily
oversubscribed, by 6.5 times in respect of National Power and 9.1 times
for PowerGen.
This means that institutions will be keen buyers of the part-paid
shares today but will obviously only buy at a fully paid equivalent
price which is lower than the old shares cost.

ROY Aitken, Aberdeen's caretaker-manager, saw his side drop deeper
into danger after having lost 2-0 to Celtic, and then admitted: ''The
players in the dressing room are bewildered over some of the decisions
in the game.''
The one-time Celtic captain was obviously as unhappy as his Pittodrie
players about the penalty decision which gave the Parkhead men a
half-time lead. When Pierre Van Hooydonk went down after a challenge
from Brian Irvine four minutes before the interval, the Dutchman picked
himself up, dusted himself down, and scored from the spot.
But angry Aberdeen players claimed that referee Andrew Waddell had
over-reacted. And Aitken himself said: ''I cannot say too much in case I
am pulled up in front of the bigwigs. But there is no doubt that we were
beaten by decisions which I cannot comment on, and decisions which I did
not understand.
''I am not saying that the breaks went against us. I am saying that we
were beaten by decisions I cannot comment on.''
When asked if he was referring to the penalty award, Aitken answered:
''Were there not other penalty decisions in the game? I have players in
the dressing room who are bewildered by what has gone on.''
Aberdeen complaints also centered on a second-half incident when
Irvine was barged off the ball by Willie Falconer in the Celtic penalty
box. Their claims were waved aside by the referee.
Aberdeen now are five points clear of bottom-club Partick Thistle and
three adrift of Falkirk. But Thistle have three games in hand, while
Falkirk have played one less.
This weekend the Pittodrie men go to Firhill for a crunch relegation
clash, and Aitken declared: ''We will spend the week preparing for that.
We have to get ourselves right.''
For Celtic, meanwhile, the script was different. Van Hooydonk, who
added a second goal before the end, claimed: ''People will think that I
dived -- but I didn't. The player came in behind me and gave me a little
push.
''You have to remember that the referee was only two or three metres
away and there was no-one in his line of vision. The referee is not
blind, you know.
''I don't want to say any more. The last time this happened, against
Kilmarnock, there was too much said.''
Then the striker found himself embroiled in a row with Killie players
--yesterday he was trying to avoid that.
For manager Tommy Burns it was a result which ended a dreary league
run, gave his side a win, and pushed them closer to Motherwell and Hibs
in the race for a European place.
''I am delighted to get the win and happy at the performances of
several of the players,'' he said. ''Pierre was touch and go but he
wanted to play, and we went with him on that.''
On the reasons for leaving out John Collins -- the second big-name
player to be axed by Burns this year -- the manager explained: ''I felt
John had been off the boil for the past month and thought it was the
right time to bring Paul McStay back into that central-midfield
position.
''We also need someone in wide areas and Brian McLaughlin has been
doing that for us, and so John was on the bench for a spell today.''

THE smiles say it all, and the great resurrection shuffle moves on to
Twickenham. Now Gavin Hastings and his happy band of brothers can think
the hitherto unthinkable, and the Grand Slam showdown against England is
a reality.
Six weeks ago, with the oppressive psychological baggage of nine games
without a win threatening to drain the lifeblood from the entire
Scottish camp, the Scots beat Canada. With hindsight that win stands as
a sporting metaphor for the second coming.
Since then the Scots have never looked back. Ireland were dispatched
with workmanlike efficiency at Murrayfield and then came France in
Paris. The Scots played with passion and, at times, technical brilliance
to lay low the 26-year hoodoo of no wins on French soil.
Wales at the weekend represented, in manager Duncan Paterson's phrase,
the semi-final. Beaten semi-finalists, he observed, were pretty soon
forgotten. There is little chance of this Scotland side being easily
forgotten now.
The semi-final hurdle has been cleared and on Saturday week the Scots
-- 50-1 championship outsiders in January -- are no longer travelling
more in hope than expectation.
Forget all that has gone before. At Twickenham on March 18 for 80
minutes it will be 15 of Scotland's finest versus Will Carling's
juggernaut in white. England will, of course, be favourites, just as
they were on March 17, 1990, when they were sent hameward tae think
again by David Sole and his Grand Slam Scots.
But once again, this will be a one-off encounter of cup final
intensity as Scotland seek to secure only the fourth Grand Slam in the
history of the Scottish game.
In the immediate aftermath of Saturday's 26-13 win over Wales, it was
a point conceded by Paterson. ''Sure, we'll be going down as underdogs
but that does us no harm. We love it,'' he declared with a twinkle in
his eye.
This Scotland side has risen to every challenge that has been laid in
front of them. Twenty-six years without a sniff of victory in France was
a pretty formidable statistic. Here is another. Since the war Scotland
have played England 24 times at Twickenham. In that time they have won
only twice. They have drawn four times and seen their expectations
dashed on no less than 18 occasions.
That is the stark reality of the situation but, so often this season,
Hastings and his men have so defied the conventions of what poses for
reality that we are ready to believe almost anything.
Certainly the downcast Welsh skipper Ieuan Evans was more than willing
to believe that the Scots can go to Twickenham and realise the
impossible dream. After Saturday's game he declared: ''Yes, of course
the Scots have got a chance. If they get the English going as they did
against us today with people running from deep then they have a very
good chance indeed.
''Once they start on a roll with the likes of Peter Wright and Rob
Wainwright carrying the ball so well in close quarter situations then I
think they have a very good chance.'' But he warned: ''I don't think
they can afford to give England a lead like they did with us and against
France a fortnight ago. I don't think they can afford to do that against
England,'' said Evans.
Scotland coach Dougie Morgan, who has survived intact the maelstrom of
criticism which was his unhappy lot during the darks days of defeat, was
well pleased with his side's performance on Saturday.
''It was a tremendous performance in the first half. We played some
great rugby.'' And he added ironically: ''We're getting quite good at
giving sides a start and then coming back. But all credit to the boys
for the way they got stuck in. It would have been nice to have finished
the second half with another couple of scores but I don't think we can
take anything away from the players. It was a great performance and a
great result.''
Hastings, who will surely be awarded the Order of the Thistle but who
probably deserves to be beatified for the role that he has played in the
revival of Scottish fortunes, was, he said with massive understatement,
just delighted.
''Losing a try like early on was a big blow but it shows the character
of the team that we came back as we did. We didn't quite get it together
again as I would have hoped in the second half but all credit to Wales.
They are no push-overs and just because we managed to get a win today
doesn't take anything away from them''
The Scottish captain was asked if he had a message for Will Carling.
Hastings replied curtly that he would be thinking and talking about
England only in the week ahead.
He was asked if, at Christmas time, he could have foreseen this great
revival in Scottish fortunes. This time he was more forthcoming. ''Just
like two years ago I said that if we weren't going down to Twickenham
for the last game of the season with a chance at the Triple Crown then I
would have been disappointed. Now we've gone one stage further and we're
going down for the Grand Slam.''
And, with reference to the trials and tribulations suffered by the
coaches, Hastings added: ''I'm delighted with the results that we have
achieved in the last few games but these things don't just happen.
''An awful lot of hard work has gone into what we have achieved, not
least from the guys sitting alongside me and I'm delighted for Dougie
Morgan. He has gone through a lot and he has good reason to have a smile
on his face today.''
The coach explained just what this hard work had entailed. ''First and
foremost you have to get control of set-piece, so obviously we have put
in lot of work on lineout and scrummage.
''Thereafter, it is down to broken-play and success there is dependent
on decision-making. Players absolutely have to make the right decisions
in contact situations. They have to decide whether to go to ground or to
play the ball out of contact. Now we're getting the balance right.''
At the start of the season Morgan's jaiket, as they saw in these
parts, may well have been on a shoogly nail. Taxi for Morgan, was the
cruel cry which went up in some quarters, indicating that his departure
was imminent. On Saturday the cab was despatched back to the rank and
the Twickenham limousine sat ticking over at the Murrayfield portals.

JUNIORS
EAST Region hopes Camelon were drawn at home to cup favourites
Kilwinning Rangers in yesterday's quarter-final draw of the OVD Cup.
Camelon reached the last eight after a comfortable victory over Dundee
North End by 4-1 -- goals by McGonigle, Flynn (2), and left-winger
McKenzie took them through.
A Glenafton-Arthurlie tie could be on the cards if they can overcome
Tranent and Kelty respectively in this week's replays.
Hill o' Beath, conquerors of Shotts Bon Accord in the last round, play
host to Lochee United from Tayside.
Whitburn were again drawn away from home -- this time they meet
Tayport, who beat Carnoustie in the last round. Draw:
Hill o' Beath v Lochee United; Tayport v Whitburn; Camelon v
Kilwinning Rangers; Glenafton or Tranent v Arthurlie or Kelty Hearts.
Ties on March 18.
* IN Ayrshire, Kilwinning Rangers stretched their lead in the Western
Stagecoach league with a 3-1 win over nine-man Irvine Meadow.
Referee Andrew Davis abandoned the Auchinleck-Largs game at half-time
due to weather conditions with Talbot leading 3-0.
Cumnock went to the top of the Western Stagecoach second division,
overtaking leaders Ardeer Thistle by beating them 6-1 away.
In the Downfield Cup semi-final in Tayside, Scone Thistle suffered
only their second domestic defeat of the season, going down 1-0 to East
Craigie. In the AT &amp; T League, Lochee United's 6-2 defeat of Carnoustie
Panmure keeps them hard on the heels of Tayport -- still undefeated in
the league -- and St Joseph's.
In the East Region, Whitburn went through to the third round of the
Alloa Brewery Cup by beating nine-man Bathgate 3-1.
Armadale moved into second position in the John Walker League thanks
to an away win at Livingston.
A late goal from Aberdeen provisional signing Denis Wyness gave
Stoneywood victory over Buchanhaven Hearts and kept them well in front
in the Bon Accord League. Lewis United bounced back from defeat in the
OVD Cup last week with a welcome win over Inverurie Locos.
Formartine's 4-1 victory over Dyce keeps them at the top of the first
division.
* AN appeal by Shotts Bon Accord against a #500 fine and
disqualification from the MBM Cup will be considered by a Scottish
Junior FA committee in Glasgow on Thursday.
The Central Junior FA imposed the penalties. They challenged the
validity of medical certificates submitted by Bon Accord to cover eight
players down with flu in explanation for calling off an MBM cup-tie with
Thorniewood United at the end of last year.
* THIS Wednesday, as part of their preparation for the forthcoming
international tournament against Northern Ireland, the Republic of
Ireland, and Isle of Man, a Scottish Junior Select will play Hamilton
Accies at Linlithgow. The pool is:
Hogarth (Livingston), Picken (Dalry), Walker (Petershill), Kennedy
(Glenafton), Smith (Shettleston), Feeney (Dundee North End), Tennant
(Beith), Bonar (Camelon), Logan (Auchinleck), Fulton (Arthurlie), Nelson
(Shettleston), Taylor (Whitburn), Granger (Pollok), Scott (Whitburn),
Harkness (Kilwinning), Spence (Hill o' Beath), McKenzie (Camelon).

Hibernian 1, Rangers 1
THERE is a certain inevitablity about the premier division; not just
the obvious fact that Rangers are again in front and by a huge margin,
but also in the way that even when they drop points, they somehow
increase their lead.
It happened again when the champions drew at Easter Road, yet, because
Motherwell's game was postponed, find themselves now 16 points ahead of
the Fir Park team.
The chasing pack must wonder what they have to do to halt a runaway
title victory, especially as at Easter Road the Rangers team had an even
more unfamiliar look about it than usual in a season in which the Ibrox
squad has bebn torn apart by injuries.
Flu victim Brian Laudrup joined the absentees, while David Robertson,
injured, and Charlie Miller, suspended, were missing from the previous
week.
Yet even with these problems and the juggling of the few remaining
players by manager Walter Smith, the Ibrox side produced for 75 minutes
the kind of cohesive performance that no-one had the right to expect
from them.
Afterwards, that was partially explained by skipper Richard Gough, who
insisted: ''We don't want to stagger over the finishing line the way we
did last season.
''We ended with some disappointing displays, and what we would like to
do in the nine remaining games is to put on good performances for our
fans. Even with the changes forced on us again in this game, I thought
we played well.
''It is never easy when the team has to be altered so often, but we
saw Gordon Durie play up front virtually on his own and do really well.
Then Trevor Steven was in a different role, and he was outstanding.
''Before the game, Michael O'Neill said in the newspapers that the
difference between us and other teams is that we can dig out results
even when we are not at full strength. I think that probably sums it up.
''We were under the cosh for the last 10 minutes when Hibs were coming
at us down that hill, but before then we had had the best of the game.''
Few would argue. Before Stuart McCall, tireless in midfield, scored
the opening goal in 58 minutes, Rangers had had the better chances.
Durie struck a post with one superb shot and then watched in disbelief
as veteran Jim Leighton delved into his memory bank to produce an
astonishing save just a few minutes before half-time.
Hibs, however, kept battling, and while they had scarcely managed a
try on goal in the first half, Keith Wright struck with a header 15
minutes from the end.
The goal galvanised Hibs into the type of attacking action they might
well have employed earlier against the makeshift Rangers side.
The fact that it was Wright who scored pleased manager Alex Miller
mightily. ''That,'' he said, ''was like the old Keith Wright. Not just
the goal, but his whole performance.
''He was in there worrying the Rangers' defence, and the goal will
help lift his confidence.''
Wright agreed: ''After being out for so long, it has been good to come
back and get a few goals. That was only my fifth of the season, but I
only got back to action on Boxing Day so it's not too bad.
''The goal was important because it keeps us in the hunt for a
European place through our league position. It was a great cross from
Willie Miller.
''Staying in third place was vital, as I think Motherwell, Celtic, and
Hearts will all be chasing a UEFA Cup spot, so it could go right to the
wire.''
Before then, of course, Hibs must face giant-killers Stenhousemuir in
the Scottish Cup at the weekend. It is another possible route into
Europe, and Wright admits: ''We have had our warnings about the problems
we could face there. Just looking at their results against St Johnstone
and Aberdeen is enough.
''But we went to Montrose this season and won. Hopefully, we can do
the same again.''
Rangers, meanwhile, are left to contemplate yet another long-term
injury. Left back David Robertson goes into hospital this week for an
operation, and manager Smith explained: ''David has a metal plate in his
foot -- a legacy from his time with Aberdeen -- and he took a knock last
week that dislodged one of the screws. It has to be replaced.
''It is not a serious problem, but obviously requires surgery, and he
will be out for six weeks, which virtually ends his season.''
Offsetting that was the return of Ian Ferguson as a second-half
substitute on Saturday.

EUROPEAN money markets may face fresh turmoil today after the Spanish
peseta was devalued by 7% last night and the Portuguese escudo by 3.5%.
The move followed a meeting in Brussels of the European Union's
Monetary Committee. The panel of finance ministers and central bankers
was called to discuss the fate of the two currencies, which were
devalued within the European Union's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).
Senior Portuguese Finance Ministry officials said their country was
braced for a new currency crisis.
The Governor of the Bank of Portugal, Antonio de Sousa, will give a
news conference this morning in Lisbon to discuss the results of last
night's EU meeting, a bank official said.
A Bundesbank official said in Frankfurt that the meeting had been
called by Spain after the peseta closed near new lows of 88.43/45 to the
mark on Friday after weeks of steady pressure by money markets.
The peseta's floor against the mark is 91.91 in the ERM's fluctuation
bands which allow the member currencies to move 15% either side of
central rates.
Spain's problems have been triggered by political instability which
has raised doubts about the country's ability to take the steps
necessary to get its economy in order on the way to the EU's goal of
creating a single currency within the next four years.
Portugal, whose economy is closely linked to that of its Iberian
neighbour, has also seen its currency suffer from the fallout.
The strains in the European currency grid have also been exacerbated
by the flight of the US dollar to the German mark.
Italy, too, could face turmoil on the money markets.
In an interview with RAI television, the Italian Budget Minister,
Rainer Masera, said he expected initial turbulence for the lira when
markets opened this morning but he hoped it would be limited.
''There could be some tensions initially but I hope that they will be
contained because the fundamentals of the economy are good.''
Italian markets were stunned on Friday by news that former Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his Freedom Alliance would vote against
the government's mini-budget. Probably only the lateness of the hour
prevented an even bigger sell-off, analysts said.
The lira, already under pressure from the weakness of the US dollar,
hit a new record low of 1170.00 against the German mark on Friday after
Mr Berlusconi's alliance announced its decision.
Meanwhile, the dollar faced more pressure when world currency markets
reopened in New Zealand this morning.
''We've seen a nervous US dollar start, purely because people are
unsure which way the dollar will go should Spain devalue,'' said Paul
Richards of Bankers Trust in Auckland.
New Zealand traders were very busy fielding requests from European
traders.
New Zealand's foreign exchange market, the first in the world to open,
is normally quiet at the start of the week.

Partick Thistle 0, Hearts 0
(Abandoned after 56 minutes)
SCOTTISH football doesn't half shoot itself in the foot on occasions.
Picture the scene. A guy takes his son or daughter to a football
match, pays far too much at the turnstiles, purchases a programme,
samples the club's catering facility before taking a seat, by now around
#20 the poorer. Nothing unusual there, just your average Saturday
afternoon at the game.
But now comes the rub. Something happens, like a snowfall envelopes
the field and the match referee says it's foolish to carry on, someone
may well be injured, and tells us all to go home. What then?
The answer is nothing happens, apart from the customer is shown the
door and told to get out. Such was the scenario at Firhill at the
weekend, when Partick Thistle's meeting with Hearts was cut short by
conditions in which a polar bear may well have felt distinctly
uncomfortable.
With just 56 minutes of the match completed, some members of the
audience turned up at the front door and enquired as to the possibility
of a cash refund, but were sent away with a flea in their ear and told
not to be silly.
Of course Thistle's hands are tied in the matter, a rule coming down
from on high that, after a ridiculously short time has been played in
such circumstances, the paying public should be kicked out and told if
they want to see the replay they would be made welcome, but not to
forget their wallets.
There really can be few other branches of the entertainment industry
who would get away with such disgraceful behaviour.
Tommy McLean, the Hearts manager, had a word of sympathy for the fans,
saying they were the main losers in such circumstances, but referee Jim
McCluskey had no alternative.
The action was hardly worthy a mention except to suggest that Thistle
had the better of the scoring opportunities, and despite their desperate
league position do not look like an outfit who have chucked in the towel
without giving escape a real go.
Perhaps it is time that the sport's leaders take another look at what
happens in the situation of a match having to be ended prematurely. Many
left Firhill unhappy in the way they felt they were treated, and in this
situation no-one wins.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie discovers a metropolitan jewel in the midst of
moose country
THE big, shaggy moose lumbered out of the trees and stood looking at
the road, tufts of winter coat hanging off his sides.
This was a lucky sighting because moose can be shy. The nearest we
would get to one, they had said in the Loose Moose in Toronto, was the
inn sign of what had become our nightly ''howf''.
In the midst of the great spaces of Ontario, it is perhaps more of a
surprise to find Toronto, a sophisticated city of three million people.
By day, the best view of this spectacular city is from the Canadian
National (CN) tower, all 1815ft of it.
There are two platforms, and a revolving restaurant that allowed us
just the right time for a meal to circle the city's broad avenues and
narrow older streets, and the tiny buildings of the oldest area, Fort
York. To the west, we looked directly into Ontario Place, artificial
islands built over the water, which make a fine Saturday outing. The
huge open-air halls offer everything from pop to symphony concerts, with
good eating and drinking, usually ending with music and fireworks.
Just below us was the Skydome Stadium. In summer, the huge sphere
winds back to reveal an open-air amphitheatre which caters for events
from baseball to huge special dinners with as many as 500 tables. Built
round one of its ''corner'' curves is the Skydome Hotel which, on one
side, faces over the stadium so that guests can book a suite and watch a
game.
Apart from strong Scottish roots that have even grown their own
newspaper, The Scottish Banner, Toronto is home to people from
approximately 60 different nationalities. To get an idea of the
diversity, we wandered around Kensington Market.
Many of the shops names are Portuguese but the market also has good
Jewish and Indian fare, and nearby streets are famous for their
secondhand but classy dress shops. The city's Chinatown is one of the
biggest in the world, not forgetting honest Canadian fare at Ed's
Warehouse which specialises in roast beef, and is owned by millionaire
Ed Mirvish. The Mirvish Empire now includes one of the finest old
theatres in Canada, the Royal Aleandria.
Toronto is known for the quality of its arts. The O'Keefe Centre, a
modern 3000-seat concert hall, is the home of the Canadian Opera Company
and the National Ballet of Canada. The Roy Thomson Hall has distinctive
architecture and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the Mendelssohn
Choir, and a stage for touring performers. The Art Gallery of Ontario
owns the largest collection of Henry Moore's sculptures.
Ontario runs wider than just Toronto in a province where traditions
linger. Barely an hour away, Black Creek Pioneer village goes back more
than a century, with its horse-drawn Connestoga wagons, a lazy way to
tour this 150-year-old crossroads village. The first farm was settled in
1816, and there are now 28 buildings. The tinsmith is still at work and
visitors can try their hand.
In this vast province, roads and railways run out to the far north. We
had seen our moose on the way north to Deerhurst Resort, which was
opened a century ago for rich Torontonians, who took a train to
Huntsville and then travelled by boat. Today, it is still as popular for
water pastimes, fishing, canoeing, and golf and tennis, with wooden
buildings that suit the landscape.For outdoor enthusiasts, it is only
half-an-hour away from Algonquin National Park.
But one place no-one should miss is the Niagara Falls. The way to go
is on the little Maid of the Mist. As the boat settles into a wet
cauldron of mist, the need for the slippery oilskin coat and hood is
clear. The sheer force of the water is awesome. It pours over the falls
like something solid, and the boat rocks as though it were on a rough
sea. There can be no doubt that Niagara Falls must be among the greatest
sights and sensations in the world.
Information: Air Canada flies Glasgow to Toronto three times a week
during the off-peak season, gradually increasing from April to daily
flights from mid-June to the end of September. Prices from #319 return.

THE National Farmers' Union of Scotland annual meeting in Aberdeen
last week was generally considered not to be of vintage quality -- not,
that is, until Scottish Office agriculture minister Sir Hector Monro
came on the scene to deliver a bravura performance.
He admitted to a 50-year-long involvement with the NFU and, at times,
seemed to be taking an emotional farewell. He was hinting that he might
not have too many future opportunities to join his fellow farmers in
conference. He is, after all, retiring as an MP at the next election --
and which of us would want to forecast that date with any precision.
He was certainly determined to go out on a high note and dominated the
platform for two hours, delivering a lengthy prepared text and then
entering into a detailed question and answer session.
It may have been the prospect of attending Murrayfield the following
day, but he was certainly full of rugby analogies. In a generous gesture
he invited one of his senior officials to expand on his own reply to a
question.
The response 'you've said it all minister'' elicited a ministerial
growl of 'he's kicking it into touch'.
Later, when he felt the need to call on some amplification at official
level, he inquired sweetly: ''Are you still kicking into touch?''
He drew the biggest laugh, however, when president John Ross sought to
be helpful, setting out to explain the point of a rather technical
question. Sir Hector was quick to re-assure everyone that he understood
the question perfectly -- it was the answer he was struggling with.
On the surface, the two-day series of meeting was all sweetness and
light but, it appears, there were some dark undercurrents.
The Ayrshire delegates were reportedly furious at the choice of
speaker for the annual dinner -- Dr Ian Preston, who was diplomatically
introduced in his capacity as chairman of the Scottish Council
(Development and Industry). On the official dinner menu card, however,
he was described as chief executive of Scottish Power, a post which he
relinquished a few days ago.
That was the source of the Ayrshire antagonism. To them he represented
a company which had offered about 50 farmers a total of #30,000
compensation for using their land as a base for pylons carrying power to
Northern Ireland. They had not failed to notice that his own share
options were worth many times the compensation on offer.
While it seemed to be infra dig for anyone to mount a serious
challenge to policy as outlined from the platform, president John Ross
proved that he was himself capable of the occasional barb -- directed in
each instance at government ministers.
His first target was UK agriculture minister, Mr William Waldegrave.
''I'm beginning to worry about his health,'' he confided. ''One minute
he is telling us that the CAP can't last long. Then he's telling the
Oxford Farming Conference that he doesn't see farm support going for the
next ten to 20 years. Now he seems to be putting great weight on the
views of an unrepresentative group of people he thinks will be
significantly developing UK policy for the CAP.''
Sir Hector sought to re-assure on that latter point. Mr Waldegrave's
group had been set up on a purely personal basis, he said. ''Scottish
interests will continue to be safeguarded as they have been in the past
-- by the Secretary of State and myself. We have a good record in
defending Scottish interests. I do not expect that to change.''
Sir Hector himself was on the receiving end when Mr Ross decided to
take him up on his remark that a fair amount of misinformation had been
placed in the public domain during the autumn review of hill farm
incomes.
Quite so, conceded Mr Ross. ''We did put out some misinformation. We
said they would drop by 21% and you confirmed they dropped by 24%. We
will try and get it right next time.''
Understandably, the two-day series of meetings was dominated by
concern over the knock-on effects of the animal rights issue. The union
have accepted that their case requires to be better presented and key
figures in the industry are to be briefed on how to respond to media
inquiries.
Members' concerns that the vegetarian lobby seems to be winning the
battle for the hearts and minds of schoolchildren have also been
addressed. The Scottish Farm and Countryside Educational Trust has been
given a further $1000 on top of the #2700 the union covenants to it each
year. If that battle is to be seriously engaged, however, considerably
more funding will have to be deployed. If members take up a credit card
plan it could generate #10,000 income next year, delegates were told.
What better use for the money?

SO HERE the Breadwinner and I are in Kenya. We are almost entirely
idle but I have done one day's work and I want to tell you about it.
I have an old Masai friend. He has two thousand acres of the Athi
Plains on the outskirts of Nairobi on which he keeps two hundred
Simmental cross cows. He's been using mostly Simmental bulls for
twenty-five years so they are more or less pure.
And now he wants to start registering his cattle in the Kenya National
Herdbook so that he'll have a pedigree herd. For that they have to pass
an inspection which they can do as soon as they look pure. Those are
then 'foundation' stock. Their daughters are known as 'pure' and their
grandaughters are accepted as 'pedigreed'.
No doubt because I am far enough from home to be deemed an expert, Ole
Sein did me the honour of asking me to come and select the cattle to be
put forward as foundation stock. And then the Kenya Herdbook people who
remembered I had judged the beef cattle at Nairobi show in 1987, gave me
the job of inspecting the cattle to see if they were eligible to be
included as foundation stock.
So there The Farmer was, a lone white man with a peeling nose, out in
the blazing equatorial sun, with the power of life and death over what
is intended to be the biggest herd of Simmental Cattle in Kenya.
Meanwhile the Breadwinner sheltered under the shade of an Acacia tree
and gazed lovingly at the Ngong Hills as Karen Blixon did when she was
writing Out of Africa.
It wasn't an easy job like it would have been at home. In Scotland I
know what I like and if they don't agree they don't have to invite me
back. But my job in the blazing sun was more complicated. I was to pick
anything that was sound and looked like a Simmental for the herdbook.
But the old Masai wants as big cattle as possible and some of his
biggest and best really had too much of the original zebu-type African
cattle in them to qualify. Then again, his adviser isn't really
convinced that size is what you want under the tropical sun where
drought and disease resistance, and the ability to walk miles is
important.
The cattle were in two mobs. One was cows and calves who are being
milk ranged. They are separated from their calves at night and milked in
the morning. On nothing but permanent grass they are not disappointed
with a gallon a head but that is a much needed cash crop. The second mob
are coming on to the calving.
How gentle those Masai pastoralists were in bringing in their cattle.
They used their sticks only as guides and spoke gently to the beasts all
the time. I somehow think they would be a bit slow for Maud.
The plan was to corral a mob and then put four at a time into another
pen for inspection. I made my choice and the foundation stock went one
way and the rejects went the other. I was terrified that in the end of
the day the rejects would look better than the foundation stock.
There were times when I saw my friend's eyes widen as I rejected
another of his favourites. And remember that this is not some simple
pastoralist. This is one of the feared and respected Masai. His is the
people who's traditional belief is that the cow -- all cows -- were
God's gift to the Masai. Other people who had cows could only have title
to them from the Masai or have stolen them. And here was The Farmer
telling them what to do about cows.
And if the Masai are no ordinary cowman Ole Sein is no ordinary Masai.
He is an educated man and a leader. It was he who spoke for the Masai at
the independence negotiations with the British in 1963. And again he
rolled his eyes as another beautiful big beast with that typical dropped
tail head which helps make the Zebu cattle such wonderful walkers was
rejected.
We got seventy cattle acceptable to the Society and then I had a
wander through them and threw out about ten which, although they were
Simmentals alright, I wouldn't have fancied in my herd, mostly because
they were too small.
When I was finished and we let our foundation herd go I was still
proud of my invitation and I had no fears for what I had done. They were
a fine show of cattle and a tribute to the breeder who had got them
there in the most difficult circumstances. Many died in the droughts of
94 and 93 He has to dip them a minimum of once a month against ticks and
sometimes as often as twice a week. And because of crazy game laws
forced on Kenya by the international community, he has to share his
grass with three hundred zebras who's breeding is out of control and
which he cannot shoot. There is no choice of bloodlines in Kenya. His
wife and sons are qualified inseminators and following a gift of a few
straws from the British Simmental Cattle Society four years ago, he is
likely to buy in Britain. The world market is at his disposal and AI
seems to be the way forward. I ahve already made plans to go back in two
years time to see the pure calves.
The job took from 10.30 to 3.30 in the afternoon without a break and
by the end the lone white man was the lone red man. The Farmer had been
out in the tropical sun in the middle of winter without even a hat to
protect him. He had never really believed that he had a baldy patch but
he does now. In fact he now has a patch without hair or skin.
The hot water was off when The Farmer got back to base so it was a
cold water that bathed the lobster red skin. After half a minute in that
I swear the water began to stream.
Mad dogs and Scotsmen also go out in the midday sun.

THE industrial sector is spear-heading the growth of the economy. The
index of production for January is due to be published on Wednesday as
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George, hold their regular monetary meeting.
In February, the two men decided to increase base rates by half a
point to 6.75%, but on this occasion they are expected to stay their
hands until further information on inflation and activity becomes
available.
Economists at City stockbroker, James Capel, are forecasting that
industrial production rose by 0.5% in January, taking the annual rate
down to 4.8% from 5.3% in December.
The manufacturing component is expected to post a rise of 0.4% for an
annual rate of 4.3% (5.3%).
Manufacturing slowed down in the second half of last year though it
remained the strongest contributor to economic growth. But recent
indications from the CBI and the Purchasing Managers' survey have
suggested that it may now be picking up momentum again.
The other statistic of the week is the December global trade figures,
scheduled for release on Friday. This was the month when the
non-European Union deficit tripled to #900m before falling back again in
January.
Capel forecasts a global deficit of around #1300m, more than double
November's figure.

Christopher Portnay declares his offshore interests
AS a nation we are inclined to be unimaginative in our choice of venue
for holiday breaks or even day excursions yet there are scores of places
and regions provoking both pleasure and interest by virtue of their
comparative obscurity.
In England's south lies the city of Chichester, of which few know
little beyond its cathedral. Yet its very situation close to but not on
the coast, as well as proximity to the gentle heights of the South
Downs, makes it a fine base for marine, seaside or inland activities.
The cathedral spire pinpoints Chichester for miles around and, for
those driving the busy coastal A27 by-pass, that's all they'll see of
it. Yet turn off on one of the multiple roundabouts and you'll find
yourself in what might be described as a ''big city in miniature'', its
pedestrianised central street plan a simple cross pattern pivoting on
the attractive fifteenth-century market cross.
Founded by the Romans, Chichester is the capital of West Sussex,
famous for its wealth of Georgian buildings, notably those in the
Pallant and St Martin's Square. The substantial cathedral surrounded by
its Bishop's Palace Gardens, the old Guildhall in Priory Park, Pallant
House full of rich furniture, the modern Festival Theatre and, twice
weekly, a bargain-hunter's delight of a market, all vie with slightly
more distant objectives.
Few indeed have heard of names like Gestingthorpe, Toppesfield, Castle
Hedingham and Pebmarsh. Yet A12 drivers hell-bent for the east coast
seaside pass within a dozen miles of this haven.
Only comparatively recently Castle Hedingham has sprouted a rash of
antique shops, the hallmark of quaintness. Already these dusty emporia
outnumber the other shops in the main street. The village is a piece of
Norman England clustering about its castle and red brick-towered church
with exquisite Norman doors.
Just across the Suffolk border is Sudbury, on the River Stour, famous
for a market that has been in existence since Saxon times.
Though surrounded by sea, we are nevertheless partial to the idea of
being gently marooned on smaller islands. Most of Britain's offshore
isles are to be found in the north while in the south only the Channel
Islands project themselves loudly, overshadowing the closer, less
expensive to reach Isle of Wight.
Twenty-three miles wide and 13 across at its widest point, the island
can be described as a slightly old fashioned version of the mainland
where the pace of life is slower and an old-world courtesy is still to
be found.
In high summer you would be forgiven for wondering how Wight might be
classed as a ''secret place'' with the bottleneck of its four main ferry
routes extremely well patronised, but go at any other time and the
reason will be evident. In fact, inland Wight has a solitariness about
it in direct contrast to the pleasure beaches of Shanklin, Sandown,
Ventnor and elsewhere.
Base yourself either at Newport, the island's centrally situated
capital, or, if you must be close to the sea and are of a nautical bent,
delicious Cowes overlooking the ship-infested Solent and you will have
easy access to the countryside, sprinkled with picturesque thatched
villages. The sea is never far away.
Theme parks and pleasure centres may be your idea of hell or heaven
but those on Wight have a quality about them. At historic Brading there
is the Wax Museum with a chamber of horrors and recreation of scenes
from the island's chequered history -- across the road the Lilliput
Museum of Dolls and Toys is also fascinating.
The Needles Pleasure Park is very much more pleasant than it sounds
and the Blackgang Chine Fantasy Theme Park, is definitely worth a visit.
You can get away from it all, among the rolling hills, bluebell woods
and a geology that has resulted in a variety of natural habitats which
are host to numerous species found nowhere else in Britain.
Escaping to this island provides a unique experience; its captivating
charm never forgotten. And this is what secret places are all about.

THOUGH the deletion of Janacek's piano sonata from Imogen Cooper's
recital on Saturday was something to mourn, her programme otherwise
remained so packed with good things that nobody could possibly have felt
short-changed.
It was, in any case, one of those fund-raising events -- launching, in
this case, an appeal for Glasgow University's Centre for the Study of
Theatre, Film, and TV -- that tend to be stretched out with late starts,
long intervals, spoken announcements, and other intrusions. But amid all
this, Schubert's big A major sonata, the evening's centrepiece, received
a beautifully sustained and thoughtful performance, each of its changes
of temper perfectly planted in the work's grand overall design. The dark
abyss of the slow movement was intrepidly faced, and there was no hint
of tiredness in the unfurling of the long finale.
As a pupil of Brendel and Debus, Cooper knows her way around Schubert
and Mozart, whose rarely played C minor fantasy, K396, opened the
programme in a mood of fierce baroque severity. No less impressive,
however, was her account of Debussy's second book of preludes, which was
not Brendel territory at all, but in the light and half-lights of which
she proved thoroughly at home.
Some of the pieces she filled with foretastes of Messiaen, sharp,
gleaming, rythmically precise. But whatever the pictures they conjured
up, she evoked them with a subtle sense of pace and colour that went to
the heart of the music.

Clare Henry is unimpressed by the RSA Students Exhibition.
THE RSA Students' Exhibition is a valuable part of the academic
programme. The students love it and, as the show is unselected, everyone
gets one piece in. The prizes are incidental, according to Edinburgh's
head of painting, Kirkland Main.
So far so good. Sadly the work itself is abysmal. I wish I could
merely say poor or disappointing but 1995 is an all-time low. Is
painting dead after all? These students are lost in a myre of overblown,
murky muddy, vacuous abstraction with size, not content, the
pre-requisite. The paintings are big and brown (Berry, Fairbairn,
Beveridge, Lockhart), big'n'red (Walker), big'n'hairy (Scott) big'n'waxy
(Brown), big'n' bright (Findlay and Still), big'n'bleeding (Randall),
big'n'brash (Christensen), or big'n'boring (Williams). Some even won
prizes.
The show at the Royal Scottish Academy on the Mound in Edinburgh has
been going almost 20 years. It's an important event because it lets us
see how Scottish art schools are doing and what the next wave of
Scottish artists are up to. It has changed -- more students means only
one work each, nothing from the third years, and a size restriction of
8ft. Thank heavens for restrictions. Make it 5ft or less next year
please. Scale poses its own problems, especially when there is no
intellectual content, no technical proficiency, and little aesthetic
judgment.
The huge rooms seduce artists into working big. On this showing
students can't handle it. Heavy handed layers of paint are pulled,
pushed, dripped, or splashed, to no avail. Should students be free to
fool themselves with these vast acres of undisciplined canvas and pails
of paint? I know that Scottish art schools are producing excellent work.
So where is it?
''Students are not necessarily the best judge of their own work,''
says Aberdeen lecturer Joyce Cairns. ''They tend to think their last
picture is the best. I miss the drawings -- and the third years. They
often contributed interesting work.'' Dare one suggest the staff should
interfere more?
Sculpture fares better. Dundonian Corin Leckie's (small) sculpture of
two fighting figures wins two prizes -- the Chalmers Jervise and the new
#1000 Bushe Residency Award. Mark McCue of Edinburgh won #400 for his
effective life-sized couple, Perseus Leve La Tete, while Jonathan
Tyers's (small) Man In Repose carved into a tree stump is a joy. Wit is
welcome, too, in Cameron's Tartan Toy Ball, Graham's triangular filing
cabinet for that awkward corner, Engel's pink silk financial pages and
McNamara's blue dancer.
Installation is a newish ingredient and makes certain logistical
demands. Most installations must go in the basement room because it has
wall sockets. Works include a box of green grass by Mackinnon (who
should learn to spell), Paper Princess by Weingarten, the inevitable
chocolate piece (Campbell), Schiessl's fish and lions, and best of all a
vastly enlarged 10ft cardboard blow up of the RSA application form. This
is one of the few successful conceptual works here.
The exceptions to this gloomy picture include Lindsey Crowe from
Aberdeen with four exquisite figures in a mysterious green and rust
scenario; Norma Maclean's accomplished portrait, Gordon, with oriental
overtones courtesy of kimono and butterflies; Trine Rossevold's elegant
violet and gold profile, Michelle Anderson's Self Portrait, Marsden's
Loose Grounding, McPherson's Hyperbole, and O'Neill's Holey Cow.
These days folks worry about the artist as hot house bloom: forced
into the exhibition race too early, not doing the ground work, asking
big money too soon. In the 1970s it was unusual to get a solo show
before the age of 40. Now the pressure is on to make it by 27. Maybe
this helter-skelter rush to run before you can walk -- to produce
unmanageable 8ft canvases even if what you have to say looks better on
A3 paper -- is to blame for this year's turgid display. Let's have a
rethink for next year.

A SCOTTISH Office commitment to correct an anomaly in redundancy
entitlements for local authority education staff has been welcomed by
the Educational Institute of Scotland.
One of its assistant secretaries, Mr Ian Mckay, said: ''We are happy
that the Local Government Minister, Mr George Kynoch, intends to correct
the mistake.'' The union has put pressure on the Scottish Office to
bring forward regulations to protect education staff in central services
who would otherwise have lost thousands of pounds in redundancy
payments.
They had been left out of compensation proposals for staff who might
be made redundant because of local government reform.
Now, however, staff who belong to the teachers' superannuation scheme
but who work in central services such as education directorates, the
advisory service, school inspection teams, and educational psychology
services will benefit from the local government superannuation scheme.
Mr McKay estimated about 55,000 staff had been left out under the
original regulations.
The EIS also said it had scored a victory in its campaign to secure
teachers' futures under the single-tier councils.
In a Scottish Office Pensions Agency circular a statement says that
''Ministers do not consider that teaching posts should be directly
affected as a result of reorganisation''. Mr McKay challenged Mr Kynoch
to confirm that no teaching staff would cease employment on grounds of
redundancy or efficiency, directly as a result of local government
reform.
The union will seek a meeting with the agency on how it intends to
identify staff to whom Mr Kynoch's ''assurances'' will apply.
Staff under the age of 50 who are covered by the local government
superannuation scheme and made redundant by the move to the new councils
will, under the compensation proposals, be entitled to payments
amounting to a maximum of 66 weeks pay, depending on age and length of
service. Teachers are covered by their own superannuation scheme, with a
statutory maximum redundancy compensation of 30 weeks.

Life in a cold climate. SARA VILLIERS speaks to the Australian
principal with Scottish Ballet.
CAMPBELL McKENZIE, the young Ozzie principal with The Scottish Ballet,
has the pretty-boy looks of an Australian soap star -- which
occasionally prompts mischievous colleagues to hum the theme tune to
Neighbours as he passes. On stage, however, with an elegant hairpiece
and regal posture, he is every inch the romantic gallant, dancing Prince
Siegfried with passionate verve.
Galina Samsova's interpretation of Swan Lake, reviving the
choreography of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, concentrates on beauty and
love, not sex and death, and the onstage evolution of McKenzie's
Siegfried is from dandified prince to a man inspired by high ideals;
contemptuous of marriage he thrills to the idea of saving the beautiful
Odette from her swan enslavement. His anguish after the Black Swan pas
de deux, when he realises he has been thwarted by the evil forces of Von
Rothbart and Odile, is heartstoppingly heart-felt.
''Well,'' muses McKenzie, ''he had wanted to perform his good deed of
the century.'' Glistening from a post-performance shower and sucking on
the ballet dancers' constant companion, a cigarette, he explains how a
boy from Melbourne ended up leaping across the boards in Glasgow. It is
not as obvious as his name suggests: ''Maybe generations ago there was a
Scottish connection but as far back as I know my family are all
Australian.''
Despite the cute looks, there is an intriguing bad boy glint in the
eyes and it is easy to imagine him as a Shark in West Side Story. What
is surprising is that at the beginning of 1994 he took time out between
dancing for Australian Ballet as a senior artist and signing up as a
principal with Scottish Ballet to tour across Australia with that
musical.
''Australian Ballet was going through a rough time, which coincided
with a personal crisis for me,'' he explains. I was having discipline
problems with the artistic director and I had done a lot there in a very
short time. By the time I was 22 I was one rank below principal and had
danced all the principal roles. I had become a little disillusioned with
ballet.''
He considers the time out to have been an invaluable experience but
now wonders that he could ever have rejected ballet as a career. Halfway
through the West Side Story tour he began firing off his resume to
companies and was offered a contract by Samsova.
He's happy to be in Scotland ''because the cold weather inspires you
to stay inside and work to keep warm'' and also because he feels that
his profession is more respected in Europe. ''Whether they think you are
effeminate doesn't matter, they appreciate the physicality, but in
Australia it's not taken seriously. I once told a taxi driver there that
I was with Australian Ballet and he said 'yeh, but what do you do during
the day?'''
But McKenzie admits to missing ''a hot Christmas and the outdoors
life''. Certainly, he is renowned for having combined ballet classes
with Australian Rules Football practice.
''Oh, set this one straight for me,'' he laughs. ''I played when I was
a kid, like all Australian kids do, although I do still love football.''
He is amused by the anecdote, a neat publicity line, but also bemused by
its constant and hyperbolic circulation. ''I don't think a busload of
Manchester United fans are going to show up at Swan Lake because they
think Siegfried is a football player.''
He believes ballet is more enduring than sport. ''It combines
athleticism with artistry,'' he says gravely, ''and you can't make
artistry redundant: a dancer can always perform.'' Clearly, he need
never give up the day job.

IF you want to explode reality on the stage, it's important first to
create that reality. The problem with this production of Jose Rivera's
apocalyptic, end-of-millennium fantasy is that the early scenes of
ordinary domestic life are so alien and unfamiliar that when the real
weirdness starts it's hard to know what has been lost.
I'm hardly the biggest advocate of scenic realism, but I do wonder how
this play would work on a conventional pros-arch stage. As we sit on two
sides of Kenny MacLellan's long and narrow, abstract set of concrete and
tower blocks, there is little intimacy generated between actor and
audience. A bed gets flown in to suggest a Bronx bedroom, but the front
door being thumped by an angry neighbour seems miles away and, despite a
clever sound design, loud music from another apartment fails to impart a
sense of claustrophobia.
By the second half when all food is made of salt, the angels are at
war, and a mentally unstable man gives birth to a still-born baby, the
bleak, open spaces of the set make perfect sense. Alas by that time it's
hard to see what sense Rivera is making of the important issues he has
raised. Society's ever-increasing level of violence and the concomitant
destruction of the planet might well be forebodings of catastrophe, but
what happens after that?
The play's strength is that it dares to ask the question and, with the
help of a little magical realism, takes us into unusual and demanding
theatrical terrain. Its weakness, at least in this production directed
by Philip Howard, is that it raises more questions than it answers.

CONSUMERS are continuing their love affair with High Street store
credit cards despite the relatively high interest rates they carry,
according to figures published today.
But consumers are still cautious about big spending commitments, such
as new cars, because of worries over job security and interest rate
rises, said the Finance &amp; Leasing Association.
There was 60% growth in the past year in cards operated by retailers
such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Dixons.
Unsecured and secured loans rose by more than 30% during the same
period.
But consumers still seemed to be steering clear of new cars. Corporate
purchases remained stable, but during the past three months there was a
16% fall in purchases by consumers.
There is also continuing concern about the general level of business
investmnent.
A survey of association members showed there was a reduction in large
capital project investment.

HERE is one to watch out for. Coming your way soon, four singers and a
pianist from Scottish Opera with a portable tour of operatic highlights.
Small venues, off the beaten operatic track, are the target.
If there is a single criticism that might be levelled at the Essential
Scottish Opera tour, which opened on Saturday to a packed house at
Hyndland's Cottier Theatre, it is that the operatic fare is of the
nouvelle cuisine variety. That is, it is a very short programme: 90
minutes, including an interval.
That said, look out for this show (touring throughout Scotland over
the next month). It is superbly cast, with two sopranos -- Susannah
Glanville and Lisa Milne -- tenor Ian Storey and baritone Andrew
Hammond, and is accompanied with exemplary pianism by Ian Shaw. It is
also finely structured, with the singers themselves introducing the
items (without a bump) and with a concentration on ensemble numbers.
Okay, those who ache for the big solo aria still get a quick hit from
the Prologue to Pagliacci, La Donna e mobile, and O mio babbino caro.
But the real strength of the show is in the ensemble numbers --
beautifully sung -- and especially in the second half, where the great
quartet from Fidelio flows into the final duet from Poppea (the two
women) then the Pearl Fishers' duet (the two men) culminating in the
Champagne Ensemble and finale from Fledermaus; an exquisite progression.
See Kaleidoscope in Weekender each Saturday for regular details of the
tour.

HIS debut album having this week charted at No 3, Tricky was the
height of Bristol fashion on Saturday night, but far from ship-shape. We
liked the band who share Tricky's name. We liked their lazy loping
grooves, but we didn't like him. No. Why?
Live, Tricky transpired to be a nervy, inexperienced rapper who
muttered desultorily, head downwards. No projection. In painful
contrast, Tricky's between-song addresses, delivered with a gormless
West Country burr, were taunting and truculent.
He spurned our applause at one point, saying we were too easily
pleased. Later, he offered a heckler a fist-induced instant nosebleed.
Plainly, Tricky is to trip hop what Paul Ince is to silky soccer: an
insult, stud-marks on the thigh.
Polly Harvey? I liked her when she slinked up on to the drum-riser in
her ankle-length crimson satin dress and shook her booty . . . and there
was a curious lighting effect which turned the taut red satin into an
X-ray plate, and I began drooling.
However, after several dunts in the ribs, Paul Ince-style, from my
bird, I eventually agreed that me and Polly were both victims of rock's
demeaning gender-fascist impulses.
Polly's music? Generic Goth-rock doomabilly, three parts Nick Cave to
one part Tom Waits, with a nod to Led Zep, and Polly's I Think I'm A
Mother is a clumsy steal from Captain Beefheart's Drop-Out Boogie. Red
dress; red mist; red card for theft, Polly.

TIME is fast running out in drugs giant Wellcome's battle to save
itself from the clutches of rival Glaxo.
Since Glaxo launched its #9400m bid last month, Wellcome has been
hunting for a friendly ''white knight'' improved offer, but so far
no-one has emerged as a rival bidder.
However, there is speculation in the City that Zeneca has been running
its slide rules over Wellcome in an effort to decide whether to mount an
offer before Wednesday's 3pm deadline.
Newspaper reports suggest that Zeneca might mount an alternative bid
which would value Wellcome in the region of #10.5bn.
Meanwhile, analysts reckon that bids from American giants Pfizer or
Johnson &amp; Johnson or Swiss-based Roche are still possible.
But Glaxo stole a march on possible rivals when it won pledges from
the charitable Wellcome Trust for its 39.5% stake in the company, and it
is thought to be confident that a rival bid will not materialise.
Failing the eleventh hour emergence of a ''white knight'', only the
absence so far of clearance by the US competition authorities can
frustrate Glaxo.
Glaxo believes acquiring Wellcome will offer the chance of significant
cost savings, particularly in research and development.
Glaxo is thought likely to make a counter-bid if an alternative offer
does emerge.
Wellcome's shares rose on Friday as speculation about a counter-bid
mounted, but closed at 1041p, 4p below the Glaxo offer price --
indicating that the market thinks Glaxo will succeed.

NEW and more effective ways of dealing with sex offenders in Scottish
prisons have been called for.
The initiative is contained in the latest research for dealing with
vulnerable prisoners, most of whom are sex offenders on protection
regimes.
The study, commissioned by the Scottish Prison Service in 1991, has
been carried out over the last three years by Edinburgh and Cardiff
universities.
It says senior management should agree to a national strategy on
therapy for sex offenders.
The common aim of all the involved agencies was reducing the risk such
offenders posed to women and children on their release back into the
community, and researchers urged a maximum co-operation among these
agencies.
The report says: ''The concept of through care for sexual offenders in
which supervision and support continues after release is now required to
be developed more fully in conjunction with professionals operating in
the community.''
The need to provide services attempting to tackle the problem was now
recognised and accepted by prison management, staff and allied prison
professionals such as social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists.
Almost 90% of officers who were questioned were willing to become more
actively involved in future specialised programmes for sexual offenders.
They were also optimistic the programmes would bring about a reduction
in offending.
The report warns, however, that many officers feared further
development ''being curtailed by lack of Scottish Prison Service
commitment and resources''.

BUILDERS who happily filled in the ditch of an Iron Age fort have been
ordered to take the earth they dumped out again . . . by hand.
The clash between modern and 2000-year-old technologies happened as
workmen were digging foundations for a new Vodafone relay station close
to an ancient Celtic settlement at Caerlee Hill, near Innerleithen.
The fort is a Scheduled Ancient Monument under the protection of
Historic Scotland.
Historic Scotland expert Dr Sally Foster will today meet
representatives of National Transcommunications Ltd to assess the
damage.
They will work out a programme for the painstaking removal of the
earth, under the supervision of an archaeologist, so that the fort ditch
is restored to its original state.
NTC project manager Mr Peter Thompson said yesterday at the firm's
Winchester headquarters: ''We were fully aware of the archaeological
importance of the site and had told the contractors.
''Unfortunately, the message didn't actually get through to the guys
digging the ground.
''In fact, they thought they had done rather well to find what they
believed was a convenient ditch and neatly level the site.''
Mr Thompson added: ''We very much regret what has happened. We accept
that we have the responsibility to pay to put things right.''
A Historic Scotland spokesman said: ''The soil will all have to be
removed -- and it will have to be done by hand.''

The return of Jessica Williams.
OPTIMISTS believe that something good will come out of every
situation. Jessica Williams has every reason to be an optimist,
therefore. A back injury caused the California-based pianist's Glasgow
International Jazz Festival concert to be cancelled at short notice last
July.
It was one of only two UK appearances planned on what would have been
her first visit here. Now she is fit again, her Scottish debut has been
rescheduled and this time it's part of a three-week UK tour. So the
delay, albeit painful, paid off.
A startling technician who served a tough jazz apprenticeship playing
Hammond organ in clubs on America's East Coast (''I'd be a bass player
with my left hand and a saxophonist with my right, playing in the most
ridiculous tempos''), Williams had seemed set for a career in classical
music. She enrolled at Philadelphia's prestigious Peabody Conservatory,
aged nine, and soon proved to be a non-conformist, encountering, she
says, ''much kicking and screaming about anything that wasn't the
repetition or regurgitation of dead people's music.''
Not that she has anything against classical music. She loves ''the big
five: Rachmaninov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Tchaikovsky, Borodin, and
Mussorgsky'' and allows that there is a bit of classicism in her
playing. ''But I want to make something new now and I did then. I kept
changing Rachmaninov's fingering, altering his chords, much to my
teachers' chagrin.''
One of her more flexible teachers told her she should play jazz and
gave her a copy of Dave Brubeck's Take Five. She was 13 or 14 and that
was the end of classical music for her. ''I was off by myself. I had all
the right albums -- Miles Davis's Kind of Blue, John Coltrane's Love
Supreme, Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch, all the early Monk albums. I grew
up living with these, they changed my life. I learned every solo -- be
it trumpet, piano, whatever -- by osmosis because I never sat down and
worked them out.''
To this day, she says, she can play something once and it will stay
with her forever. She left the conservatory at 16 to be ''out there with
the cats in the clubs''. Later, towards the end of the 1970s, having
moved west, she played for three years at San Francisco's Keystone
Korner club, backing such jazz greats as Stan Getz, Dexter Gordon, and
Jackie McLean, utilising her huge stretch (she is 6ft, 1in tall and has
proportionately large hands) on her trademark big, dense chords and fast
phrasing.
The reviews of her most recent album, In The Pocket, released on
Edinburgh's Hep label, compared Williams to Bill Evans. Praise indeed,
but gaining such acceptance, as a woman, she says, hasn't been easy.
''That hasn't changed,'' she says, ''and it won't until we change the
way we raise our children. Music is a spiritual entity 'way beyond
sexuality. Not that sexuality isn't a part of it, but it's not the be
all and end all.''
A further measure of her acceptance was the award last year of a
Gugenheim Fellowship, normally the preserve of professors and
archaeologists rather than jazz musicians. Financially, it took the
pressure off for a while but more importantly, she says, ''I can now
approach colleges and they'll know I'm someone who knows what she's
talking about even though I have no degree in music.''
Does she have any regrets about not completing her conservatory
course? ''Not at all because sometimes formal education can be a real
block to learning. When I was growing up, school was all about social
acceptance and being what everybody wanted you to be -- and I didn't
want to be what anybody wanted me to be. They say you should follow your
bliss and that's what I've done. It's taken me through some pretty weird
avenues of experience. But I wouldn't change a thing about the way I've
lived my life.''
* Jessica Williams is at the BBC Studios, Edinburgh, tonight; and The
Lemon Tree, Aberdeen, tomorrow.

JESSICA Williams is like no other jazz pianist. It's not just that
she's female, and there are so few prominent women jazz
instrumentalists. Nor is it that she's extremely tall (the stool was
adjusted to its lowest level before she began). Rather, it's the
absolute unpredictablity of her playing.
A Williams audience is not allowed to be complacent. Recognising the
tune does not mean you can settle back and stop thinking. Quite the
opposite: this is edge-of-the-seat stuff which demands concentration. It
is utterly impossible to second-guess how this first-rate technician is
going to manipulate the melody and swing the moods.
The first set of her concert on Saturday night was dazzling, both
musically and visually: her huge, elastic hands produced crashing,
clashing chords one minute; and finicky flurries of triplets the next.
What was missing in the early stages, however, was a sense of genuine
emotion: the tunes, though extremely impressive, failed to bridge the
emotional gap between performer and listener.
Clearly more relaxed after a near-euphoric reaction to the first half,
William loosened up, lightened up, and warmed up (literally -- she was
suffering from the cold weather) with Dave Brubeck's Summer Song -- the
kind of ballad that's so haunting you try to remember it all the way
home.
Nice Work If You Can Get It revealed a sense of playfulness in her
pianistics: there were the Wallerish strides on the one hand and the
Monk-like discords on the other, not to mention the use of the strings.
But the best was saved for encore-time: a sumptuous and supremely moving
interpretation of My One And Only Love, played latterly in the style of
a hymn.

Douglas Thomson reports that as Frank Sinatra approaches 80 he remains
determined to keep a firm grip on the microphone despite worries of
those close to him about his ailing health.
ENTERTAINMENT giant Frank Sinatra's family are turning into a
squabbling rat pack as the man who millions regard as the pop singer of
the century enters his eightieth year. Sinatra has had health problems
for the past decade and at times they may have indisposed him but he has
never lost his raffish urbanity -- the scrappy, tough and cool image.
He still commands multi-million dollar concert fees, his Duets II
collection is a present best-seller worldwide and as you read this --
give or take a time zone -- in the wee hours in some saloon somewhere
they will be listening to him.
The man so classically dubbed St Francis of Assisi with a shoulder
holster who is part myth, monster and marvel now suffers from
microangiopathy of the brain which springs sudden attacks of dizziness,
confusion and often long periods of memory loss.
Star-spangled Sinatra, legend and lout, hero and hoodlum, the Sultan
of Swoon who has made more than half a century of headlines gave what
his intimates believe was his final ''farewell'' -- doing a duet with
Willie Nelson -- last month at his celebrity golf tournament in Palm
Springs.
Close friends and family say that the onetime Chairman of the Board,
The Boss, the leader of the bad-boy Rat Pack, The Man and, of course,
Ol' Blue Eyes will be testing the limits of his health if he continues
to perform.
He can be bad mannered, bad tempered and bad news but those around the
self-styled ''saloon singer'' who will be 80 on December 12 believe he
should put his feet up. His daughters Nancy and Tina -- who produced a
memorable television biography of their father -- sincerely want him to
stop appearing in public.
Today's image is of a man who has lost it. He's collapsed on stage,
he's forgotten the lines of some of his most famous songs. His daughters
do not wish him to continue to be a mumbling embarrassment.
They feel his fans want to remember him as the legend who went from
bobbysoxers to broads, who met The Mob and The Kennedys, who fought
feuds, enjoyed insults and indulged in boozy, brawling behaviour. As the
man who when he played Las Vegas the neon billboards just proclaimed
''He's Here''. For gamblers the Nevada town was where luck and Sinatra
competed for absolute deity.
''Frank is an old man now and most of the people around him are
concerned about his health,'' said a close associate adding: ''It's just
a question of how best to deal with it. The girls, his daughters, and
Frank Jun feel it is time for him to fully retreat from the public eye.
''But his wife Barbara feels that having engagements and recordings
keeps him active -- gives him something to get out of bed for. She
thinks that still being a performer is what is keeping him alive.
''The situation has got the family in a turmoil. Everyone has an
opinion of what's best for The Old Man. Sometimes the 'discussions' get
quite heated. But that's the Sinatras . . .''
Family friends and associates paint a curious picture of Sinatra
today. ''He's mellowed,'' says one and that is countered by another:
''He's a real mean bastard.'' And you must recall that in the swinging
days some of his close friends called him The Monster.
Sinatra has always been acutely aware of his mortality. Many of his
family, from his mother Dolly to friends like Sammy Davis Junior and
Jackie Kennedy Onassis, who he wanted to marry, have gone. When he gave
charity lectures his closing line was always: ''I hope you live to be
400 years old and the last voice you hear is mine.''
''Frank is now obsessed with dying -- with it all ending,'' I was told
by a Sinatra watcher in Palm Springs. That's where he lives in the
California desert close to the junction where Bob Hope Drive runs into
Frank Sinatra Drive and where he keeps a lighted Christmas tree at the
front of his home -- The Compound -- for 365 days of the year.
''An extra Christmas never hurt anybody,'' he explains.
And his associates believe he must take it easy if he is to have
another Christmas. ''He's had a rough, tough life and you are talking a
classic burning-the-candle-at-both-ends personality. We just want him to
take care of himself -- to enjoy the September of his days. He's sung
about them often enough,'' said one of the people closest to him adding:
''But he does have an opinion on how he wants to run his life -- and
let's everyone know it.''
Sinatra who used to enjoy taking a private jet from California to New
York or flying off from Palm Springs just to go ''sight-seeing'' has
made no travel plans for this year. And that's a first. Normally his
flight schedule could keep a team of traffic controllers employed.
''He enjoys staying home now. He likes to have familiar things and
people around him. It's strange but I think he gets a little scared with
strangers and strange places. It's hard to imagine but that's how it is.
He is now a man of routine. He likes his comforts and his place,'' said
an associate.
Our perception of him is as a breaker of hearts and legs but there is
the saintly side -- he's given more than $250m to charity. Today he
wears someone else's hair -- the toupees are shampooed every evening --
and Hawaiian shirts which just about disguise the girth.
The overwhelming image from talking to those who know the Sinatra 1995
model is that he is a cranky, conservative old man who lives remembering
old scores and even recalling the start of new ones. There have been
many long, hot days of egomania but he has never sought sympathy. If
anything, it's his voice which has aged gracefully. He can still fly
people to the moon or invite luck to be a lady this or that particular
night.
Over the years the myths have multiplied and how much is fact or
fascinating fiction only he knows. One thing is certain and that's that
there would require much polish to wipe away the tarnish.
Barbara Sinatra has been working at it since she became his fourth
wife on July 12, 1976. It's not been easy. She was 44 when she married
Sinatra. A former Las Vegas showgirl and former wife of Marx brother
Zeppo and the single-parent of a grown-up son from a teenaged marriage
life, it has been tough and then pleasantly indulgent. She was not some
ingenue on long, shapely legs. She know what she wanted from being Mrs
Francis Albert Sinatra.
She mellowed him faster than a crate of his favourite Jack Daniels
bourbon. She advised, she controlled. She talked him out of playing a
Mafia don in Godfather III.
Her influence has been much more than any other of Sinatra's women,
including the love of his life Ava Gardner, his first wife Nancy, Mia
Farrow and lovers such as Lauren Bacall, Natalie Wood, Juliet Prowse and
Gloria Vanderbilt.
Today he still regards Barbara Sinatra as a broad but ''a classy
broad''. He remains robust in his Runyonesque view of life and friends
say that evenings spent with them are casual but lavish in food and
drink and hospitality.
At home Sinatra, in a hard-to-accept image, does most of the cooking.
He has a vegetable patch where he grows his Italian herbs -- the basil
patch is immense -- and he serves up bruschetta at the bar over which
swings a song ''Living Well is The Best Revenge''. He markets his own
''Sugo de Tavola'' made by Artanis -- Sinatra backwards -- Food
International.
They have ''his'' and ''her'' cacti gardens and there is a special
area where he keeps his model trains away from the swimming pool, tennis
courts, film projection room, four two-bedroom guest cottages and ''the
back house'' which has four bedrooms. It was his wife who decided to
name the various buildings after his songs. The main house is ''The
House I Live In'', his office is ''My Way'', the projection room is
''Send in The Clowns'', one guest house is ''High Hopes'' and another
''Young At Heart''.
But he's looking at 80. He's bald and bulging and illness has left him
reflective. Often he gazes over the New York Times crossword, to which
he is addicted, and remembers. His daughter Nancy says: ''There has been
so much garbage written about my father it is time to turn it around.
When you consider what he has done he deserves better treatment than he
has received.''
Most of us would accept Sinatra as an extraordinary mix of heel and
hero. There are the stories of his constant, callous womanising, his
heartless treatment of his first wife Nancy when she was in hospital
after giving birth to Frank Jun, insulting behaviour to Natalie Wood
during their affair, his arranged abortion for Elizabeth Taylor, cruelty
to Mia Farrow, his affair with Lauren Bacall as Humphrey Bogart lay
dying of cancer and his subsequent six-year campaign of silence against
her when she told the world they were engaged.
And of the third Nancy in his life -- Nancy Reagan -- of whom he said
before she had even scented the White House: ''A dope with fat ankles
who could never make it as an actress.''
But the image today is of a man who has amazingly survived so long. He
could drink most people -- Ava Gardner and Elizabeth Taylor excepted --
under the table and fervently believed he could call as well as sing any
tune. A sign outside The Compound in Palm Springs which sits in an area
for those who have the money to buy such elegant privacy and the
required outrageously expensive air-conditioning systems to fight a
sighing battle against the blistering heat reads: 'If you haven't been
invited you'd better have a damn good reason for ringing the bell''.
He remains cantankerous.
''Frank is not going anywhere without a fight,'' said a friend of the
Sinatra family, adding: ''But everyone realises he is getting on in
years and must take things a little easier.''
Frank Jun, said: ''He's nearly 80 and I must say he is still able to
communicate with an audience. What warms him more than anything else is
the wonderful, loving response he gets all over the world.''
But when the time comes, we should recall his friend Marlon Brando's
remark: ''Sinatra is the kind of man who when he dies will give God a
hard time for making him bald.''

ATTENTION, jazz fans: from tomorrow Glasgow is seeking to reinstate
itself on the mainstream jazz map, with a concert being promoted by a
new organisation, the Jazz Co-op.
Last year the city lost its principal venue for year-round jazz and
folk music -- the Glasgow Society of Musicians at 73 Berkeley Street.
Increasing debts and regular maintenance problems left the club's
coffers empty and even a gala jazz concert failed to produce the cash
required to keep the 109-year-old building operational.
The loss was particularly felt by the jazz community. Between
festivals, the society was the only place in Glasgow where the top names
in American and British jazz could regularly be heard in the company of
local rhythm sections.
Like their audiences, these visiting musicians regret the passing of
the society. American clarinettist Kenny Davern says of the venue: ''It
was one of the nicest places to play that I've come across. I always had
a good time there. And acoustically it was perfect.'' His sentiments are
echoed by fellow frontliner, cornettist Warren Vache: ''The society was
a very unique place and it deserved a lot more support and attention
than it got.''
One year after 73 Berkeley Street was put up for sale no other
organisation had stepped in to take over from where the society left
off. Davern, Vache, and the other artistes who, as a matter of course,
used to include Glasgow on their touring schedules began to fly over it
en route to such unlikely spots as Nairn, and the audience which once
attended society gigs was left with nowhere to go (except north).
Now, having had time to lick its wounds and devise a way out of its
financial mess, the society has reinvented itself -- as the
aforementioned Jazz Co-op. With the specific aim of promoting jazz gigs
by visiting musicians, the co-op has been set up by members and friends
of the former Society of Musicians who have agreed to sponsor concerts
collectively, and use the profits to underwrite future events.
Tomorrow's first show stars Scott Hamilton. The tenor saxophonist,
from Providence, Rhode Island, has been playing since the age of 15, his
career taking off in the late 1970s when he was signed to leading jazz
label, Concord. Hamilton counts among his influences Don Byas, Illinois
Jaquet, Zoot Sims, and Coleman Hawkins.
Given his age (at 40 he is still young in jazz terms), his full,
swinging, sound is unusual in that it has evolved from, and expanded on,
the legacy of these players rather than going off on a trendier tangent.
As he says: ''I seem to be putting along in my own lane.'' But he's not
travelling alone. A new generation of saxophonists is now citing
Hamilton as an influence; his name following on naturally from the
greats he mentions himself.
Hamilton is a fitting headliner for the Co-op's first venture since
his annual visits to the society always attracted bigger-than-average
crowds. So much so that his last Glasgow gig was transferred to the more
capacious Moir Hall -- now the venue for this overdue return
performance.
* Scott Hamilton and the Ronnie Rae Trio at the Moir Hall tomorrow at
8pm. Tickets available from Mitchell Theatre box office and ticket link
outlets.

THE blinkered nature of British society is nowhere more obvious than
in the desperate gap between work and family responsibilities.
The lack of tangible results from the Opportunity 2000 initiative
promoted by the Prime Minister has been blamed on the scarcity of
appropriate childcare.
It should come as no surprise therefore that a much more specific
programme by the Department of Employment, the #45m Childcare
Initiative, has had the opposite effect, with demand for places ensuring
that the number of schemes has mushroomed in the past year. There are
now 254 in Scotland and that number could well double by next March
(when the grants run out), according to Irene Audain, development
officer of the Scottish Out of School Care Network.
Originally they were set up in areas of priority need in Strathclyde
and Lothian and most were funded by Urban Aid grants. The Department of
Employment grants (administered through the Local Enterprise Companies)
are intended to kick-start new schemes which must become self-financing
after a year. It has had the effect of bringing after-school clubs to a
much wider group of parents and children. No longer confined to the big
cities, they are now flourishing from the Highlands to the Borders,
although are still scarce in the most rural areas largely because of
problems of staffing and transport.
The Scottish Consumer Council became aware of the enormous unmet
demand for after-school care a year ago when their Scotland-wide panel
of volunteers met to suggest topics of concern for future research. That
has now resulted in a document which will be sent to every primary
school in Scotland, urging school boards to consult parents about their
requirements for after-school care.
Deirdre Hutton, chairman of the SCC, expressing her own horror at
cases of ''home alone'' children, said: ''The hours between 4pm and 6pm
can become a nightmare for working parents. School hours and holidays do
not run parallel with conventional working patterns, but for single
parents, those whose children have special needs, those in rural areas
or on low incomes, the problems of childcare outside school hours can
seem insurmountable. Out-of-school care can provide an answer to these
problems in the form of a caring, safe, active, and stimulating
environment for the child.''
Some out-of-school services run only during term time, others cover
holidays and staff training days and costs vary from about #15 per week
to over #40 depending on the service provided. Some parents in
year-round schemes prefer to pay a higher fixed price every week to
cover the extra cost of the holidays.
Terry Smith, who has been funded by the Glasgow Development Agency to
develop further schemes in Glasgow, has helped set up 20 new ones in the
past year. ''The demand is enormous. I receive about six phone calls a
week from parents who want a scheme in their area. They are very
committed. I warn them that it is not an easy option because they need a
management committee which is responsible for employing staff, but they
are keen to undertake training to make it work,'' she said.
The initial grant amounts to about #500 per child for the first year,
but projects must become self-financing after a year. The finances of
any group depend not only on the charges to parents but also on costs.
Most meet in schools but different authorities have different letting
policies, some charging rent and others not. Irene Audain of the
Scottish Out of School Care Network added: ''One of the concerns we have
about the new shadow local government authorities is that they may feel
unable to continue the free let of schools to out-of-school care and
that would be a severe blow to some groups. There are many lone parents
and others on low incomes who cannot afford to pay higher fees but who
need to work to support their children or who can take a training course
only because of after-school care.''
Some parents have found it difficult to set up a group in their local
school because of concern from the head teacher about possible damage to
school property or disruption to cleaners' and janitors' duties. Jackie
Welsh, who researched the subject for the SCC, said: ''Use of school
premises beyond school hours can help reduce the incidence of vandalism
and there is anecdotal evidence that out-of-school care schemes attract
parents to the school.''
That was confirmed by Terry Smith, who said that schools on the South
Side of Glasgow offering after-school care had an increase in placing
requests from parents who wanted to use the service.
The report has been targeted at school boards because the SCC sees
them as ideal co-ordinators in a process which involves consultation
with parents, and the education authority must take account of matters
brought to their attention on behalf of parents by the school board. At
the last count 1691 of Scotland's 2341 primary schools had school
boards.
What is the opinion of the real consumers? The children at the
Rosemount Project in Royston approve. ''It's great,'' said Frances, who
prefers playing with her friends in the group to watching a video at
home. Nicole and Kerry like painting, while Kathleen enjoys making
cakes.

I WRITE in reply to Carol A Kirk commenting on your account of Jackie
Stewart's dyslexia (February 22).
While I agree that pupils with learning difficulties are best
supported by a range of strategies, unfortunately in many cases this
does not happen. Although there is a lot of good work being done in this
field, as illustrated by Carol Kirk, educational authorities are working
with limited resources, and in some cases limited understanding.
I spent a year researching my book, Whispers in the Graveyard, and
spoke to people involved at all levels with this problem. The book is a
fictional work based on the experiences of dyslexic children, and tells,
from the child's point of view, of the difficulties encountered.
It has become very clear to me that there are still pupils who are not
picked up at all and therefore do not receive any help. Others are
diagnosed very late, which makes life, even with some support, much more
difficult for them.
Gavin Bell's very moving article revealed that, in fact, Jackie
Stewart did not cope with his dyslexia. His life at school was torture,
which is why he feels so honourably compelled to do something about it.
Sadly there are today many children and adults still in the same
position.

IN contrast to Mr Sheridan's experience of British Gas service in St
Andrews, here is an outline of our current situation (February 27).
On January 24, while my husband was in hospital, the central-heating
boiler stopped working. I called the service number and the engineer was
here within a very short time. When told there was a clanking noise as
the boiler cut in he said it came from the fan. The diagnosis was
''over-heating'' and he got the boiler working again.
On February 2, the day my husband was to be discharged from hospital,
the boiler was dead again in the morning. The engineer came in the
afternoon, said there was an electrical fault and returned with another
engineer. They got the system going but said a couple of parts needed
replacing.
On February 3 we had a call to say there might be a delay of a few
days before one of the parts was available from the manufacturer.
On February 12 again the boiler was dead. The engineer who came first
on February 2 arrived, looked at the machine, and said a new fan was
needed, which he would order next day.
On February 21, as we still had not had the boiler attended to, I rang
the manufacturer myself and was told a fan was in stock and, if ordered,
would be delivered by Friday. This information was given to British Gas.
So, despite numerous calls to the service number, we remain without
central heating and hot water.
We have now received notification that our annual service has been
arranged for March 8. We hope, by then, that there is a functioning
machine to be inspected.

MICHAEL Fry's article was a good example of the hypocrisy and
simplistic thinking which characterises the current public flogging of
social work (March 1).
He suggests that there has been a series of tragic blunders over
several years but makes no real attempt to assess the incidence of
social work's highly publicised mistakes against the hundreds or
thousands of cases that have been correctly managed.
Is social work's track record really that much worse thans that of
doctors, for instance, making mistaken diagnoses and botching
operations, or even that of journalists' misleading stories and gross
infringements of privacy?
It may be that child protection work got sidetracked by the ''mumbo
jumbo'' of Satantic abuse, and equally social workers' collection of
evidence may not have been adequate from an adversarial-legal
perspective.
But what are we saying to social workers -- do not intervene until it
is too late, leave children in abusive situations rather than risk
public criticism by removing them, guard your own reputation rather than
the wellbeing of children?
Sheriff Miller did not conclude that the Ayrshire children had not
been abused, but rather that the case could not hold up in court,
although in fact it had been upheld by another sheriff previously.
The children may be returned to parents who have abused them, in which
case the judicial process as well as social work will have failed them.
Criticism of social work practice may be right and lessons need to be
learned, but to imply that there is a simple pathway through the
minefield of family abuse is dangerous in the extreme.

I AM perplexed by one of Allan Cousins's plans for this year's
Edinburgh Film Festival (February 24). He intends to take over a small
city cinema and make it a shop window for all films shown in Britain
over the past year irrespective of their merits. Surely this
indiscriminate and expensive display of films is hardly one of the
responsibilities of a film festival.
Following last year's director's retrospective of an indifferent
Hollywood director, Andre de Toth, I am relieved to note that Stanley
Donen of Singin' in the Rain fame has been selected this year, but Mr
Cousins's comments on Donen's work hardly inspire confidence. He
considers correctly that some of his later films ''have both a sadness
and melancholy''. But why select Indiscreet? Surely that film was
neither sad nor melancholy but pure enjoyable Cary Grant kitsch fare?

DICKENS'S moral of need not greed, in his tale of Oliver Twist, is
lost on Tory Ministers. John Major is not the first to misuse the
child's hungry plea in his scare-mongering claims about a Scottish
assembly (February 25). Twelve years ago the Education Minister, Sir
Rhodes Boyson, rubbished a report on crumbling school buildings with the
retort: ''They cannot, like Oliver Twist, keep asking for more.''
Education funding cuts on both sides of the Border are similarly
dismissed by Ministers including Ian Lang, whose #200m payment for local
government reorganisation just happens to match the total budget cuts
being forced on local authorities this year.
Parents in England, having taken the Dickensian moral to heart after
more than a decade of steady erosion, are demanding more money for
education in mass rallies, ballots, and lobbies of Parliament.
In Scotland it is only by local authorities, like Strathclyde, risking
legal penalties that our school budgets are less affected than England's
so far. But that is no cause for parental or public complacency. It is
high time we too started asking the Government for ''more''.

Let's hope Councillor Sheridan never gets on any education committee
(March 2).
What hope lies ahead for the future generation when they are incited
by ''responsible'' adults -- elected representatives of the people -- to
rebel against authority? To leave their desks, at a time for many just
prior to important exams, and what for?
To be use as cannon fodder, as a tool for heightened publicity, in the
protest against the M77 extension? The Pied Piper analogy used by
Councillor Murphy is most apt.
Our rights to freedom of speech and demonstration are severely
compromised when they are so abused. This is all happening at a time
when the education authorities are trying to curb truancy. But the most
abhorrent aspect is the use of these children as a ''human shield''.
It's outrageous. It should be stopped.

WITH regard to your article, ''Row over care role for the private
sector'' (February 25): what really counts is the quality and level of
care which is being delivered and at what cost to the taxpayer.
Councillor James Burns, vice-chair of social work for Strathclyde
Regional Council, stated at a meeting of the Lanarkshire Community Care
Forum that he recognised that the private sector provided a better level
of care than his own local authority homes but thought that the price
was also higher.
He was surprised when he was told that while it was agreed that the
private sector does offer a higher quality and level of care, it does so
at a far lower price than his SRC homes -- #194 per week for a service
that the SRC pays itself #295 for.
Even so, the SRC is getting the benefit of the doubt; some estimates
have been as high as #440.
In fact, the SRC can purchase nursing-home care, with all the benefits
of more and better trained staff, for less than its own costs. The cost
of one week in a nursing home is #290.
In my view the SRC social work department has known of this deficiency
in getting value for money. Why else would it employ Price Waterhouse to
do an investigation to tell it that it is getting value for money?
What the private sector wants is the level playing field that was
promised. Cosla, in the main, represents enabler, provider, and
paymaster, hence giving it an almost monopolistic position. Cosla's
attitude in walking out on talks serves to remind us that it is very
difficult to extract justice from such a large and powerful body.
It is known that not all of the members of Cosla are antagonistic
toward the private sector. If these members are interested in listening,
then we are very interested in sitting down to find a solution to this
mess. We will not walk from the table in the ''huff''.

It would be a classic foot-shooting exercise if typical Scottish
intransigence and shortsightedness resulted in the demise of the
Waverley. What a blow to Glasgow's and Scotland's tourist promotional
efforts.
After all the time that has elapsed since the flood damage occurred I
hesitate to offer the following as surely others will have checked it
out already. However, just in case, is there not a legal point in the
Waverley's favour regarding right of passage on what is a public
waterway?
The GDA as owners of the bridge are obstructing the Waverley's right
of passage notwithstanding the GDA's desire to effect repairs if only
the SECC management would co-operate.
As such, is there no legal means to force GDA/SECC to solve the
problem forthwith or bear the financial burden that will hit the
Waverley?

ANDREA Calderwood has done well to quadruple the number of commissions
for BBC Scotland, but just what does this amount to if London does not
give her the money to make them into programmes (February 20)?
We are fed an endless diet of routine cop shows, anodyne sit-coms, and
soaps; they come and go with their increasingly predictable formulas.
What does not come around very often is the dramatisation of a rare
treat like Swing Hammer Swing. The decision by BBC Scotland to bring
this distinctive and original Scottish work to a wider audience was
commendable, and the combination of Geoff Torrington and Peter McDougall
was inspired.
That the men who hold the purse-strings in London should exert so much
influence over what BBC Scotland can produce is alarming.

AS one who has an elderly relative and who is currently trying to
navigate a way through the maze of guidelines, social workers, and
council accountants' opinions my sympathies are entirely with the
Wisharts and Mrs Berry (February 27).
The rules which this Government has put in place are just one great
muddle and the only thing that is certain is that the oldest, weakest
members of society, those who are least able to protest and protect
themselves, are being made to pay for a service which they were told in
their younger days was free.
Your correspondent was quite correct when he criticised John Major's
stated ambition that he was striving to establish a property-owning
democracy where property was passed on from generation to generation.
We younger members of the community will have time to set proper
provisions in place for our future but the legalised robbery which is
being perpetrated on our parents and grandparents without due warning is
disgusting and is only now coming into the public attention.
Councillor Gould has the right idea in stating that a threshold should
be introduced and I believe that this should initially be at a higher
level that #50,000 and could be progressively reduced as the years go
by.The publication of new guidelines was a missed opportunity to do
this.
I wrote to my relative's MP, with a copy to John Major, posing the
question as to why litigants such as the young Maxwells can claim legal
aid and their lavish homes are not taken into account in the awarding of
assistance while humble pensioners are supposed to liquidate their
hard-earned savings down to the last measly #3000 before they get full
assistance.
As a lifelong Conservative supporter I am ashamed of the deceit that
this Government is inflicting on the old and weak and I am sad to say
its arrogant and ignorant attitude (not confined to this issue alone)
will reap havoc for it when the results of the next General Election are
announced.

THE magic of George Gershwin has fascinated me since boyhood, those
haunting melodies evoking the spirit of New York City in particular as
no other composer has managed to achieve.
The fact that in my own youth an old friend of our family used to tell
us about visiting the Gershwin home in the early part of the century
added a personal poignancy to the story of a man who changed the face of
music before his tragic end at the age of 38.
So wherever I hear the hint of a Gershwin melody, from Rhapsody in
Blue to Porgy and Bess, I become a willing victim. It was the bait which
took me to the Theatre Royal in Glasgow the other evening for one of
those ''Thank You, Mr Gershwin'' programmes which, too often these days,
leave you wondering why they bothered to thank Mr Gershwin.
When some of those jazz ensembles get together they have an irritating
habit of disappearing up the aperture of their own ego, so indulging
themselves in fancy improvisation that you are hard put to recognise
what it is you have come to hear.
Mike Pyne's Manhattan Club Trio had its moments and Elaine Delmar
possessed all the vocal requirements of the composer's repertoire. But
during a quite dexterous keyboard version of a Gershwin Rhapsody, my
fairly keen musical ear was much more aware of Mr Pyne than Mr Gershwin.
Similarly, as I anticipated one of my favourite songs, The Man I Love,
at its best in a lazy velvet, I couldn't believe the high-speed rhythmic
race which turned it into farce for people like me.
To crown all, there was this infuriating practice of mutual
admiration, where the musicians point at each other to solicit applause
for solo performance, rather like they used to do in the circus when the
seals had done their bit.
So my mind wandered to happier thoughts of George Gershwin, whose
music took on that added dimension in our rural home with the periodic
visits of Bertie Forbes from New York.
Bertie had gone forth from our Aberdeenshire parish at the turn of the
century, a poor country lad who nevertheless founded the most
prestigious financial journal in America, Forbes Magazine. Back home
every two years, he would play Saturday night card games with my
parents, breaking off to tell us of his acquaintances in New York.
The names Rockefeller and Woolworth cropped up frequently. And so did
Mrs Gershwin, with whom Bertie joined in Saturday night card games like
this. So I would sit spellbound as he regaled me with tales of her sons,
George and Ira, when they were just boys about the house and long before
the world would savour their genius as composer and lyricist.
They were native New Yorkers, of Russian stock, but the call of
Hollywood compelled the Gershwin brothers to move to California, where
they established a quite palatial home at No 1019 North Roxbury Drive,
just a couple of leafy streets away from the Beverly Hills Hotel.
When I eventually made it to that seductive corner of the Los Angeles
conurbation, I began paying homage outside No 1019, by then occupied by
singer Rosemary Clooney. (Ira had moved next door to No 1021 by the time
I saw the inside of a Gershwin home.)
And there I would stand with my thoughts, trying to fit the musical
genius of George Gershwin into a particular villa in Beverly Hills,
where he would sit at the piano, forging his harmonic patterns and
surprising even himself with the originality of phrase.
In 1935 he had seen the birth of his folk opera, Porgy and Bess, which
didn't reach Britain for another 17 years. I remember the excitement of
going to London in 1952 when it opened at the old Stoll Theatre, which
was due to be pulled down when the run finished.
Standing outside his old home, I remembered how George Gershwin
disliked the Hollywood scene. And something else was troubling him: his
bald patch. Seeking a solution, he invested in a contraption as big as a
washing machine, which sucked blood to a stimulated scalp. But was that
all?
As I stood by the sidewalk of North Roxbury Drive, I was recalling the
night George arrived home from a Sam Goldwyn party and didn't make it
into the house. He sat down on this very kerb, trying to contain an
unbearable headache which had been alternating with bouts of depression.
There were tests and reassurances but finally the emergency of an
operation. He did indeed have a brain tumour, which turned out to be
inoperable.
George Gershwin died in July 1937, still just 38, with so much
achieved but surely so much more to come. They took him by train to his
beloved New York, for which he never ceased to pine.
And there the crowds gathered for his funeral service at the Temple on
Fifth Avenue, brother Ira so devastated that his exquisite talent as a
lyricist refused to function for quite some time afterwards.
Passing the Beverly Hills house even now I could swear there's a piano
playing inside, reaching for that opening ascent of Rhapsody in Blue
with echoes that will last for ever. Bertie Forbes could never have
guessed that Mrs Gershwin's little boy was heading for immortality.

INTERNATIONAL Women's Day takes place on Wednesday and a variety of
meetings and debates, which will include politics, beauty, and social
affairs, are scheduled, and no more so than in Glasgow. Engender,
sponsored by the city council, is producing many events, including
exhibitions on Afro-Carribean and Oriental work, sport, self-defence,
music, and poetry.
The Herald will list the major items tomorrow.
There are several versions of how this 24-hour celebration started.
Some say it was to commemorate strikes held in 1907-08 by women who
worked long, dangerous hours in sweatshops in New York. Others believe
it was initiated by Russian women who, under Stalin, again worked in
poor conditions.
In 1926 March 8 was adopted as a day of celebration in Britain.
World-wide recognition came in 1977 when the United Nations formalised
International Women's Day. The date has become known as a time to
further women's rights, peace, and freedom.

Canadian expert Julie Lee is in Scotland to highlight the crusade
against abuse of women and children. Jennifer Cunningham talks to her
about her work with the Battered Women's Advocacy Centre in Ontario.
THE Zero Tolerance campaign which brought the hidden crime of men's
abuse of women from girlhood to old age to billboards and the backs of
buses moves today to Ayrshire. Kilmarnock has never been at the
forefront of feminism, but a conference in the Grand Hall today will
hear of the latest research on practical ways of righting the gender
imbalance from Canada.
Julie Lee is executive director of the Battered Women's Advocacy
Centre in London, Ontario, and consultant to the police college in
Ontario as well as an academic expert on abuse of women and children.
Her achievement is in uniting practical and effective help for
vulnerable women with a high-profile public attack on the establishment.
It is significant that she was the first adult in Canada to have her
stepfather prosecuted for abusing her when she was a child. That was in
1982 when ''the home was seen as a haven and there was complete denial
that such things could happen''. She ran away from home because of the
abuse and made it from life on the streets to university.
She has knitted the two strands together in London, Ontario, the town
with more millionaires per head of population than anywhere else in
Canada. That has resulted in an unchallengeable demonstration that it is
not only poor and uneducated men who abuse women -- or poor and
uneducated women who are abused. Most of the women who seek help from
her advocacy centre are middle-class women, and they do not want to go
to a shelter.
''Our research shows that the average middle-class woman is battered
35 times before she approaches our service, but women who are not so
well off have been battered an average of 10 times before they come to
us. Often they have great problems in leaving home.
''We assess their immediate situation at home. It is possible to help
women to become safer in their own homes if that is what they want --
and 50% of the women who seek help from the advocacy centre do, because
otherwise they may lose access to income and access to their children,''
said Ms Lee.
They create a safety plan of practical steps to take in preparation
for escape in an emergency, such as leaving spare clothes and spare car
keys with a trusted friend and opening a savings account. A measure of
just how threatened some of these women are is the advice about not
allowing arguments to develop in rooms without access to an outside door
or near a telephone. In all seriousness they are urged not only to buy
rope ladders to escape from second-floor windows, but to consider
replacing wooden doors with metal ones and installing an electronic
alarm system.
''We know that the higher the degree of isolation, the higher the risk
and so we encourage her to seek support from family and neighbours,''
said Lee, who sees the rescue service for individual women as only a
part of the work of the centre. It is also a means of bringing about
changes in the institutions of the criminal justice system.
Initially 24% of reports of violent assault on women resulted in
charges being brought. It is now 97%. That is no ground for complacency,
she says, because their most recent review showed that 50% of women were
dissatisfied with police procedure. Complaints included police not
responding quickly enough, not giving sufficient explanation of why
charges had not been brought, or breaches of procedure such as making
sexist remarks.
Largely because they received a number of Government grants which
required to be monitored, London, Ontario was the first place to set up
a system for dealing with the problem on a community basis. In 1982 the
London Co-ordinating Committee to End Women Abuse was created to
implement and analyse the results of the research.
Its members were judges, lawyers, police, women's advocates, mental
health counsellors and church, education, and community organisations.
It soon became apparent that there were gaps in the services and
particular problems for the criminal justice system in meeting the needs
of abused women.
The London Battered Women's Advocacy Centre was established and
gradually some of the gaps are being filled. There is a counselling
service for abused women and support during court procedures for victims
and witnesses, there is a specialist mental health centre for children
exposed to the abuse of women, prevention programmes are being developed
with the school curriculum.
Despite the all-embracing composition of the committee, its stated
principles are unashamedly feminist to a degree which similar groups in
the UK would find challenging. Among the publicly-stated principles of
this government-funded centre are: ''Violence and abuse are defined by
those who enjoy social power. Consequently, the extent of the abuse is
often minimised, denied and/or trivialised.''
Lee sees her centre's role largely as an educative force for social
change, counteracting 2000 years of male-dominated institutions.
''People are willing to talk about the issue of women abuse now,
although we are finding a schism between lip service and action.
''Between 1986 and 1993 our research showed that for young men and
women in their senior years at school and university, feminism had
become the F-word, but over the past two years, there have been
significant inroads to their attitude. There are many reasons why young
people have become critical again in a way they were not in the 80s --
not least that society is not offering them jobs, and discrimination
against young people by social institutions.''
The centre remains challengingly upbeat. Their latest fund-raising
campaign (30% of their budget depends on donations) is based on the
slogan: ''We're out to change the world, what's it worth to you?''

IT IS three months since Mr Christopher, the US Secretary of State,
was last in the Middle East; that has proved to be too long an absence,
since during it the momentum of the peace negotiations between Israel
and her neighbours has faltered. Things are little better on Israel's
domestic front for the General Election looming next year seems likely
to result in a Labour setback which would be bad news for negotiations,
though Labour's loss need not automatically ensure the return of Likud
given the fragmented state of Israeli politics and the peculiarities of
its (proportional representation) electoral system. There is, however,
little doubt that Israeli opinion is blaming Labour for the way in which
little has remained sweet, now that the first enthusiasm for peace has
dissipated and a succession of diplomatic difficulties has emerged.
Mr Christopher's energy -- and tact -- may be necessary again. Some of
his handicaps, like the Republicans' cut in financial help to Jordan,
may not be too important. Of all the neighbours the Jordanians are most
anxious for peace. And the disagreement between Israel and Egypt over
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty need not be too difficult either.
Israel has been thought to have a nuclear capacity for a long time now
but Egyptian attempts to use this as a diplomatic lever are recent; the
Americans could hope to contain feelings on this front. Even the Syrian
hesitations about the future of the Golan Heights, which has slowed the
rapprochement there, need not be too worrying. The Syrians are playing
hard to get, but the Israelis cannot allow them to get too much too
easily. Any Golan agreement would, however, allow the Israelis to
concentrate their attention on the real problem, which is with the
Palestinians. It is with the Syrians that the Americans could prove most
persuasive -- for economic reasons.
The Palestinians are the core of the problem, and there is no
gainsaying its intractable nature. Part of the Israeli complaint against
the PLO can be dismissed easily. No more than the Israelis themselves
when they ruled Gaza and the Jericho enclave directly, can the PLO
suppress the likes of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main guerrilla
groups. It may be easier for the Israelis to deal with their extremists,
but not very much easier. Both extreme elements would like to frustrate
the peace negotiations but that should only reinforce the PLO-Israeli
understanding. Instead both Governments are effectively blaming each
other. The fact is that it is hard to contain fanatical guerrilla bodies
in modern societies, no matter how hard-line a Government is. President
Mubarak is unable to suppress his Islamic militants, a failure he shares
so far with the Algerians. How the PLO is expected to do it, with far
fewer resources than these two states, is far from clear. Israeli
popular opinion will not take kindly to the wave of suicide bombings;
but who would? No matter how improbable it seems the present Israeli
Government and the PLO have become partners in a great enterprise. Mr
Christopher could help them to further it.

YOUR reporting of the case of the Ayrshire children (February 28) is
clear and helpful. One disturbing aspect of the case, however, seems to
need highlighting. You report Sheriff Miller as saying that the
Reporter's case fails because ''the balance is either level . . . or
tilted slightly towards the petitioners''.
If I interpret this correctly he is saying that there is maybe a 50%
chance, or possibly a 40% chance, that the children had been abused.
I understand the ''balance of probabilities'' argument in not making a
judgment against the parents, but in child protection what balance of
probabilities justifies sending children back into a situation which has
even a 40% chance of being abusive?
Does this really mean that chldren are knowingly to be put at this
level of risk because the case is technically undecidable? This may be
correct in law, but it is potentially disastrous in practice.
If anything new is to be learned from this case it may be that the
judicial process is appropriate to the legal rights of parents but it
has considerable difficulty in dealing with the child's rights to
protection.
Your editorial correctly stresses the need for training and
guidelines, and Strathclyde region seems now to have acted on both,
recognising that general training does not necessarily qualify social
workers for cases of this complexity.
When two sheriffs can reach such different conclusions, is there not
also a very clear case for suggesting that sheriffs might themselves be
included in an appropriate training programme?
Legal training and expertise do not automatically equip sheriffs to
understand what children are saying or to assess the evidence of expert
witnesses in an area where experts themselves disagree.

MR TONY BLAIR has two duties to fulfil when he addresses the Scottish
Labour Party conference in Perth this week. The first is to his party,
for he must carry the day on vital issues like devolution, Clause 4, and
policies towards Europe if he is to continue the process of transforming
Labour into a government-in-waiting. The second is to the public. Mr
Blair and his colleagues propose substantial changes in the way Scotland
and Britain are governed. There is some agreement that change is
necessary. Far from honouring their stated aim of spreading
decision-making throughout the country, the Conservative governments of
recent years have centralised many powers and concentrated those
significant ones that survived in quangos which have all the public
accountability of the average golf club. This has to change, though the
Government's belated recognition of the dangers in respect of the
administration of water in Scotland are far from acceptable. Mr Blair's
solution for these ills is the democratisation of quangos (and make no
mistake, he will be held to that) and the granting of devolution to
Scotland.
We have already welcomed devolution in principle, arguing that it will
allow the development of Scottish skills and talents which are at
present stifled or lost to other countries. Nevertheless, acceptance in
principle is not the same as acceptance of all the detail, and here we
come to the centre of what may develop quickly into a real crisis for
Labour. There may be as much as two years until the next General
Election; then again, there are those who argue that an election might
come around a little sooner. Whether the latter is correct or not,
Labour faces a pressing need to answer in detail the many questions
which persist in clustering around the devolution proposals for Scotland
and the reform of government in Wales and in the English regions.
Those intensified at the weekend with the revelation that Mr Blair is
not committed to regional assemblies in England while Mr Prescott does
not regard the commitment as withdrawn. The truth is somewhere in
between; to be exact, in the bosom of Mr Jack Straw who is reviewing the
issue and who will report in June. Further confusion has been caused by
Mr Blair's suggestion that a majority of seats for the SNP would not
necessarily translate into independence for Scotland. This particular
issue is probably academic. Nevertheless, carelessness with words should
not be allowed to become habit forming. On the question of tax-raising
powers for a Scottish assembly, there has been mention of an ability to
raise or lower tax by 3p in the pound and this would amount in the
current situation to a sum of #600m. While there appears to be a measure
of public acceptance for the notion of raising extra tax for vital
services like the NHS, Labour must still work hard to convince us of
substantially higher taxes as a general benefit. Far better to put flesh
on this idea and give details as to what purpose any tax raised by a
Scottish assembly would be put. Labour's insistence in bulldozing
through a devolution Bill in the first year of a new government is, in
the absence of any hints as to how it could be accomplished, even more
puzzling. A bitter struggle in Parliament absorbing the energies of all
concerned would be harmfully debilitating. Once more, we need to be told
how this can be managed. Mr Blair's rhetoric can be compelling; now we
need the facts to match it.

WHERE DID WE GO WRONG? By Eric Roll.
Faber &amp; Faber: #12.99 (pp143)
IN the Thatcher years we were all urged to celebrate the fact of
Britain's economic renaissance. Scepticism was scorned. Bad mouthing the
miracle was regarded as a not-so-minor act of treachery. Talking down
Britain, as the Lady herself put it, guaranteed the severest
handbagging.
But now that she's gone, the climate has changed. Books charting
Britain's ongoing economic decline are not only multiplying, some are
clearly meeting a public demand. Will Hutton's The State We're In is
currently high in the best-seller lists. Last year, Paul Ormerod
published the Death of Economics, challenging, among other academic
targets, the entire intellectual underpinning of the Thatcher years.
Those lifting their voices anew to question what has really been
achieved are generally still in their forties, a younger radical
generation giving public voice to doubts which had been stilled when the
Thatcher juggernaut was still roaring down the track. But the younger
revisionists are not alone.
In his latest book, Eric Roll -- Lord Roll, the Austrian-born one-time
senior Whitehall mandarin and, later, leading City investment banker,
now in his 87th year -- is concerned with the same territory and shares
much of that same diagnosis.
Where Did We Go Wrong? charts Britain's relative economic decline from
1925, when we returned to the gold standard at our pre-war parity, to
1992 when sterling was ignominiously ejected from membership of the
European exchange rate mechanism. Of the Thatcher years in particular
Roll concludes: ''The history of the period shows quite as many ups and
downs of economic activity as earlier ones with equally fluctuating
effect on the balance of payments, the exchange rate and the public
finances. There certainly is no evidence that stop-go had been
banished.''
Britain's has been a story of ongoing national decline, Roll insists,
relative to competitors at a similar stage of economic evolution. In
1900, he writes, we ranked third in per capita GDP and first in exports.
By 1987 we were 15th in per capita GDP and fourth in exports. By 1990
Britain ranked 18th out of 24 developed economies in income per head,
behind countries like Italy, Australia, Norway, and even tiny Iceland.
While such alarming numbers are at the heart of Roll's indictment, the
book is not stuffed with statistics, charts, and tables. It is intended,
says its author, for the general reader and has been kept as short as
the chosen canvas allows.
Short means 131 pages plus index. In that brief space, Roll undertakes
two main tasks. First, barely 70 pages are devoted to the how of
Britain's economic decline over that near 70-year period. The even
slimmer second section is devoted to why, the likely causes of our
problems. To deploy such strict economy of resources to a question as
big as that implied by Roll's title in turn raises questions about
whether the book can do more than scratch the surface of its chosen
subject. But first, let's look at what Roll does manage to say.
He came to Britain as a 17-year-old immigrant to study economics.
After a distinguished academic career, Roll went on to become a civil
servant, working in the Ministry of Food and the Treasury. He was
involved in major policy issues which shed light on his question --
Lend-lease, the Marshall Plan, the creation of Nato and Britain's first,
rebuffed attempts to join the European Community.
The culmination of Roll's Whitehall career was taking charge of the
Department of Economic Affairs, the 1964 Wilson Labour Government's
attempt to restructure the way the economy was managed. From 1966, Lord
Roll embarked on a third career, as a City investment banker, latterly
as president of the now-troubled Warburg Group.
So this indictment of Britain's economic failure over most of this
century comes from an impeccably inside source. Roll concedes that the
cradle of the industrial revolution could hardly have hoped to cling on
to its domination of the world economic scene for a further two
centuries. He also concedes that many of Britain's besetting problems
are far from unique. But he argues that, from 1925 onwards, when faced
with the major challenges on the balance of payments, dealing with
unemployment, stagnation and the nature of our role in Europe, we have
consistently made the wrong choices.
The 1925 return to the gold standard was ''a fatal error''. Coming off
it again in 1931 solved that problem but weakened Britain's social
cohesion. In the post-war settlement after 1945 we consistently failed
to recognise the profound geo-political changes taking place around us.
The nub of Roll's indictment is our long-standing ambivalence to the
new political order in the rest of Europe. We clung to our over-stated
special relationship with the United States -- though even there we
vitiated the quality of that link through jealousy and resentment of the
Americans' post-war dominance. But our uncertainty, vacillation and
downright hostility to much of the rest of Europe continued through the
Thatcher years, to the present day.
Why this destructive introspection? Roll rejects wider cultural
theories about the gentrified British turning their backs on commerce.
He seems ambivalent about the extent to which a culture of manufacturing
was squeezed out by an emphasis on living off the manufactures of
others, through a burgeoning global financial presence.
In his final pages Roll seems to seek in vain among such random areas
as the intellectual failings of economics as a discipline and successive
post-war changes to the Whitehall machine. He quotes approvingly Alfred
North Whitehead: ''Those societies which cannot combine reverence to
their symbols with freedom of revision must ultimately decay.''
Although the book is, in general, refreshingly non-partisan -- the
references to politicians and other leaders living or dead are few and
far between -- Roll concludes by slamming politicians of all hues for
being too thin-skinned, too willing to take refuge in the charge that
critics are simply denigrating their country's achievements.
He is right in that. But if the critics are to be free to point up the
failings, it behoves them also to chart new ways forward. For such a
distinguished public servant and leading City figure to offer so little
in the way of solutions -- his final section, What is to be Done?,
stretches to just one page and offers little prescription -- is part of
the problem we face.

PLANS to create a ''mini Colditz'' to house problem families in a
respectable Dundee council estate could be given the go-ahead today.
Councillors will decide on a #1m plan to convert the three-storey
tenement block into ''sin bin'' homes for offending families.
The tenement is to have:
* A surrounding 6ft high steel fence.
* Four cameras to monitor comings and goings.
* Armoured glass windows.
* A 10.30pm curfew for residents.
Dundee District Council officials describe the ''suitcase' families
involved as ''vulnerable'' and the scheme has the support of the council
and the National Children's Home charity which is concerned about the
plight of children in homeless families.
They say that the families will be given help and counselling to
become better citizens and will have to sign strict contracts
guaranteeing their behaviour to keep their homes.
However, residents of the city's St Mary's ward fear the arrival of
problem families in their neighbourhood and are campaigning to stop the
plan.
Leading the fight to stop the project in St Clement's Terrace is Mr
Ian Borthwick, independent Labour councillor who has represented the
area for more than 30 years.
Last night, he said: ''Even if the social work committee of Tayside
Regional Council does approve the scheme tomorrow, our fight will not
stop.
''A petition with over 2000 signatures has been sent to the Secretary
of State, Ian Lang. ''Eighty individual and well-constructed planning
applications have also been submitted to the local planning department.
''We are hopeful that Mr Lang will order an inquiry and that the voice
of the people of St Mary's will be heard.''
He added that local residents had never been ''properly consulted''.
He said that this type of scheme could only be successful if it had
the support of the local community. ''In my opinion, it is therefore
doomed.''
But Mr Ernie Ross, Labour MP for Dundee West, said: ''I can understand
that people are fearful of the unknown.
''We will be monitoring this project to ensure that it is run
absolutely correctly and that there will be no trouble.
''This is the ninth sensitive project of this sort in Dundee. The
sites are picked by professional council staff, precisely to avoid
accusations of politicians keeping projects out of their backyard.''
He added: ''Out of the eight projects up and running, seven are in
Labour wards and one is in an independent ward.
''Consultation cannot and never has taken place about the siting of
these projects because, quite naturally, people would rather not have
them next to their houses.
''But we have sought to reassure people and there have been very few
problems with places which are up and running.''

FUNDING for Scotland's oldest Aids charity has been dropped by health
boards in Strathclyde region.
Scottish Aids Monitor has been told that funding of more than #190,000
will go to the newly-formed Project for HIV and Aids Care and Education
(PHACE West) after growing concerns about SAM's west coast service.
All four health boards in Strathclyde -- Greater Glasgow, Lanarkshire,
Argyll and Clyde, and Ayrshire and Arran -- switched funding because of
a lack of west coast personnel on SAM's boards.
However, Scottish Aids Monitor say this was not a criterion for
funding and that it is approaching people from the west to sit as board
members.
PHACE West sent unconditional job offers to the private addresses of
SAM staff and letters to its volunteers.
Three former workers with Scottish Aids Monitor have joined the new
organisation, which will begin operating on April 1. Because of the loss
of funding, two SAM employees have been made redundant.
Dr Linda MacCallum, who chairs the SAM board, said: ''This new
organisation has never provided any services for people affected by HIV
and Aids, has never held a public meeting, never openly consulted
service users.''
A spokeswoman for Greater Glasgow Health Board said: ''It was a
unanimous decision by all four health boards. They felt the services
they wanted to provide needed a clearer West of Scotland focus than SAM
was able to provide.''
A spokesperson for PHASE West was unavailable for comment.

Women beware women. There's no shortage of chauvinists of the male and
porcine variety in politics -- and we'll come to them in just a little
minute. But the distaff tendency in that game isn't currently much of an
advert for supportive sisterhood. If Winnie Ewing were to cast her mind
back nigh on three decades (and the lady does seem to have a
prodigiously well-preserved memory), she might recall that there was no
shortage of women prepared to believe that a female candidate in the
likes of macho-clad Hamilton was a sure-fire vote loser for the cause.
In fact, you suspect she only got a crack at the seat in the first place
because the huge Labour majority seemed to suggest that any Nat with the
temerity to challenge it was cast as sacrificial disposable lamb.
Madame Ecosse might also reflect that women are not what we might
characterise as over-represented at the elected end of Scottish politics
and that a winning female candidate of any party persuasion could only
help to redress that ludicrous imbalance. God and every would-be female
candidate knows that it's difficult enough at the best of times to make
it past the good ol' boys on to the short leet, without having to fight
your corner against the sisters at no extra charge. Witness the scarcely
veiled fury among Labour's menfolk at the notion that in 50% of winnable
seats the short leets should be all-female.
According to some of the chaps in the People's Party this represents
the death of democracy as we know it. In any case, they inquire with an
approximation of sincerity, wouldn't women value selection very much
more if they got there on merit rather than some loopy form of positive
discrimination? To which the proper response is that of course women
want to get there on merit. But it has come to their notice that, at the
present rate of being judged meritorious, most women with political
aspirations are not likely to make it on to Parliament's hallowed rear
benches unless they introduce posthumous applications.
The entirely worthy 300 Group, dedicated to having half of the
nation's elected representatives female, has been flogging away at that
proposition these many years without making any discernible dent in the
male hegemony. And let's just look at the Scottish arithmetic of all
this anyway. All-women applications for half the winnable seats on the
Labour hit list. That's not exactly guaranteeing a monstrous regiment of
socialist women marching on Westminster. Once you've finished talking
about Ayr, Stirling, and about-to-be-vacated Motherwell, you soon begin
to run out of winnable seats long before you run out of fingers. On one
hand. The men can quite legitimately argue that keeping them off short
leets means that all manner of talented male candidates don't get an
even break. True. And now they know how it feels.
Meanwhile, back in the SNP camp, the compulsive soap opera continues
to unfold. When the short leet for their Perth and Kinross candidature
was first being examined it may have been a man who first posed the
question about potential skeletons liable to fall from Ms Roseanna
Cunningham's cupboard at an electorally insensitive moment. But it was a
woman who pursued this standard inquiry with all the manic enthusiasm of
a mother-in-law scorned.
Now several things puzzle me about Winnie's intervention here. First,
at the time of the supposed liaison between Roseanna and Maggie Ewing's
ex-husband, Maggie was not even a part of the Ewing dynasty. Secondly,
had her marriage to Donald Bain not broken up she wouldn't have been in
any position to make an honest man of Winnie's boy Fergus. Is Winnie
suggesting that she wishes Maggie had stayed wed to Donald? Presumably
not. So can we conclude that this bout of bile was occasioned by the
simple fact that she'd long since taken a scunner to Ms Cunningham and
wanted to scupper her selection chances?
If so, the strategy would seem to be backfiring in spectacular
fashion. Roseanna, hailed as hard-done-by heroine by the SNP council
meeting at the weekend, will be difficult for the hierarchy to argue
against when they annoint their contender this week. After all, she did
the biz for them in 1992 when there was no by-election glory on offer.
In any case, there is something more than comical about the zeal with
which Roseanna's purity quotient is being examined, given the
predilections of the late sitting Member. However righteous the Perth
and Kinross electorate may regard themselves, they still managed to turn
out in winning numbers for a man whose cupboard was so full of skeletons
they not infrequently spilled out into the press. Nicky Fairbairn didn't
just publicly glory in infidelity, he advocated it, and neither that,
nor his frequently offensive views on women and sexuality, appeared to
cause sufficient distaste to unseat him.
In any event there's more than a whiff of hypocrisy about all this.
How many men would care to have their extramural behaviour of the last
18 years scrutinised by their party, the press, or the Euro MP for the
Highlands and Islands?
The fact that Winnie is something of a national institution does not
permit her suddenly to behave like a museum piece. Particularly since
the other woman at the centre of this ancient extramarital saga is not
her but Maggie, who is old enough and smart enough to fight her own
battles and has declared there are no hostilities to pursue.
There is, of course, one other strike against Roseanna. 'Tis said she
makes her party nervous because of her entrenched republicanism. Frankly
I'd have thought anyone defending the royals to the death these days was
a much dodgier prospect.

WE finally got to meet Jacques Santer, President of the European
Commission, for the first time last week. An intimate little cocktail
do, it was, just Jacques and me and 800 colleagues from the Brussels
press corps. Despite all the fuss about his appointment and some of the
unkinder coverage he attracted at the time, Jacques Santer is rapidly
becoming very much his own man and not the cipher the British believed
they had found. His style is different from his predecessor's but the
direction he is following is exactly the same. So much for the
Franco-German puppet.
The other Jacques -- Delors -- was not a great one for conviviality.
He was too intense, unlike Jacques Santer whose winning smile and
glass-in-hand bonhomie have earned him the sobriquet Jacques Sancerre.
He is still, however, finding it difficult to come to terms with our
Government's preoccupation with European integration (aren't we all?). A
recent incident illustrates the point.
We were in Strasbourg for the European Parliament's plenary and
Jacques Santer was presenting the commission's work programme for this
year to Euro-MPs for their approval. It was an unremarkable document --
some say far too timid -- because it was constrained by the growing
unease about the whole process of European political and economic union.
Mr Santer included a few words in vague terms about ensuring the
question of border controls was resolved so that the wheels of the
European single market could be oiled. His remarks were, of course,
seized on by the British Eurosceptics as another attempt by Brussels to
bulldoze precious United Kingdom sovereignty, in this case our right to
insist that visitors show passports. A furore ensued.
Mr Santer reads his papers and he saw the fuss coming. Against this
background his words were ultra cautious. A short time later a reporter
bumped into him outside the debating chamber. Mr Santer took his elbow
and asked what on earth all the fuss was about in Britain on the
passport issue. He was genuinely worried. His last wish is to become
embroiled in this peculiarly British debate about Europe's future. It
says something about Britain being, in Major's phrase, at the heart of
Europe, when the President of the European commission is reduced to
asking reporters for a rundown on British European policy.
As the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jacques Santer might be a
micro-state man but he is also one of the most experienced leaders in
Europe. He knows exactly where he and others in Europe are going, but he
is baffled by the British Government's desperate zigzagging. His
puzzlement is shared by many other governments.
Mr Santer is, after all, the man who was catapulted by John Major into
succeeding Jacques Delors who was sneeringly dismissed by Douglas Hurd
as a ''philosopher king''. By vetoing the Belgian premier, Jean-Luc
Dehaene, Mr Major became solely responsible for putting Jacques Santer
where is today. But what has happened since? The puppet has clipped his
strings and taken on a life of his own -- as some of us predicted he
would.
Despite British (mainly southern English) opposition to the single
currency, Mr Santer has said he supports the idea and wants it as soon
as possible. This is hardly surprising because he speaks for most of
Europe's governments
On the question of passports he is also clear. Frontier checks will
go. His own country and the others who are members of the so-called
Schengen agreement -- which means those with internal EU borders -- will
scrap passport checks later this month. He wants the British and others
to do the same in principle -- and he is supported in this by all
political parties in Britain except the Tories.
And then there is the question of the social chapter of Maastricht.
Those who most loudly support it are the Tories' allies in Europe, the
Christian Democrats. Mr Santer is one of them. So was poor old Mr
Dehaene. Their flag carrier in chief is Dr Helmut Kohl -- conservatives
all.
When it comes to increasing the power of the European Parliament, Mr
Santer is also in favour. This flies in the face of Mr Major's
determination to block any new powers for the EP when the time comes
next year to renegotiate Maastricht at the inter-governmental
conference.
Why did Mr Major ever put the unreliable Mr Santer into such a
powerful position where everyone but the British knew he would behave as
the Europhile he is? The answer is not difficult to find. Mr Major is a
man out of his time. His misfortune was to inherit the leadership of his
party at the moment it had run out of ideological energy and when it was
split down the middle on the whole question of Europe.
Mr Major is, therefore, a drowning leader desperately reaching for any
straw he can find to keep his premiership and his party afloat. His
foot-stamping insistence that Cabinet unity on Europe must be
demonstrable is a joke. His job is, ultimately, impossible. He simply
cannot heal the festering wound which is slowing killing the
Conservative Government and eclipsing its rare successes such as
Northern Ireland peace.
This is why last week's little drama in the Commons was so
predictable. We shall have more of these nights until the time comes,
perhaps sooner than we think, when the game is finally up and Mr Major
must call a vote of confidence. When that time comes the bluff of the
Eurosceptics, now neatly split into sub-divisions of division, must be
called and a repeat of the 1979 defeat of James Callaghan's
administration becomes a prospect.
None of this is really John Major's fault. In the best traditions of
his circus family he has turned cartwheels, somersaults and jumped over
backwards on his tightrope to accommodate his rebels, appease his
doubters, encourage his supporters, and bribe his allies. It is all,
ultimately in vain, because the agenda for the British in Europe is
being set by the Santers of this world, comfortably outside our
collapsing area of influence.
The best thing now would be a General Election and an end to this
pointless agony.

THE Tories in a tizz -- Labour fizzing. The Government rolls back on
share options while the would-be Government prepares a ''Rolling Rose''
roadshow to introduce some Barnum and Bailey into its election
propaganda. Both parties strive to renew contact with the ordinary
voters. Mr Major needs to recapture what is known as ''Middle England'';
Mr Blair wants to cement the 40% lead he has in the latest opinion poll.
The former is on the defensive, the latter is confidently seeking to
involve the public in the fun of attacking the Government.
Mr Blair has finally goaded the Prime Minister to U-turn on his
attitude to the top pay echelons of the private sector. It is no longer
just an issue for the shareholders to control, as he has previously
insisted. He is responding at last to public outrage.
One change leads to another. His Treasury ministers now realise that
this means they must rethink their plans to allow even more directors --
part-timers -- into the perks schemes. Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken
is obliged to take this out of a clause in the current Finance Bill.
Labour of course will rejoice at this and mock Mr Major further. They
are not the only ones to claim that the Government is out of touch with
the broad mass of the middle class which has been lucky to get even 1.5%
rises under the threat of redundancy. Tory speakers, like former
minister Alan Clark, find disenchantment. He reports in the Mail on
Sunday: ''Again and again people complain that ministers don't listen.''
The deadly impression given is that the Government is permitting the
''decomposition of capitalism''. The fact that banks like Barings can
gamble, unwittingly or not, hundreds of millions of pounds on futures
abroad when industry at home cries out for investment leaves a sense of
dismay.
In the present climate, this reflects on the Government. People expect
a Tory administration to persuade its pals in the City to show some
restraint, even if actual enforcement is not a feasible weapon. Who
knows? Mr Blair might well do it better. Ministers dare no longer to
claim that the wealth creators must be allowed to get rich and create
jobs. They get rich all right in the public utilities -- but create
jobs? Quite the contrary.
The disaffection of Tory supporters is not helped by a lack of
sure-footedness. The Chancellor of the Exchequer claims that Consett
steel works is the most efficient in Europe when it has been closed for
15 years. Rural Tory supporters cannot be sure any more where their
party stands on field sports when Mr Gregory Knight, the Deputy
Government Chief Whip, votes for the anti-hunting Bill of Labour MP John
McFall.
With another trouncing in the May local elections looming, ministers
are deeply concerned that they are not matching Labour in getting a Tory
voter-friendly message across. They are beginning to talk of the
Chancellor redeeming in his last-chance November Budget a manifesto
pledge to cut death duties for the middle classes.
This does not have much shine for those whose family home is still a
negative equity and likely to remain so, but it gives Tory activists at
least something to bite on. They will need much more of the same if Mr
Major is going to be able to persuade ordinary people that they can be
the beneficiaries of his policies too, not just futures dealers and the
chairmen of the water, gas, and electricity companies with their massive
pay packages.
A dramatic sense of well-being in the majority of the erstwhile Tory
electorate seems to be Mr Major's only hope. But it is hard to spread
the glad word if your coffers are depleted. Unlike Labour, there seems
little prospect of Tory Central Office producing a glitzy, fun
propaganda portfolio.
Tory treasurers are dispatched all over the world to raise funds, but
end up, it seems, with one solitary Yorkshireman lending them #4m over
three months interest-free. A succession of big firms have cut them out
of their contributions list, remaining unmoved by the party's plight --
#16m in debt. The way things are going, it would require Lord Jeffrey
Archer to donate the entire proceeds of his next book to get them out of
financial trouble.
While the Tories are still trying to figure out how to pay off the
advertising agency they used in the last General Election, Labour
appears to have #5m in the kitty already for advertising in the next
campaign. By no means does the money come just from trade-union
donations.
So Mr Blair is in the mood for campaigning enterprise. The ''Rolling
Rose'' roadshow is born this month to tour the country and hold people's
attention. With three trailers (courtesy the Daily Mirror), they aim to
visit summer events -- motor races, May Day rallies, seaside resorts,
and suchlike. The Labour Party is to sponsor a horse-race at Brighton on
the eve of its autumn conference.
In this respect, Mr Blair is carrying on from where Mr Kinnock left
off in trying to persuade the public that Labour in government would not
be a killjoy. His deputy, John Prescott, is charged with taking
Kinnock's red rose logo into what is claimed as the most ambitious
exercise in political education ever attempted.
The roadshow will visit about 100 venues -- county shows, bank-holiday
carnivals, arts festivals, trade-union conferences -- to spread the
word. Theatres are being booked for revues satirising the Government. It
reflects not only optimism and self-confidence, but a determined lack of
complacency. It is part of the drive to convince that New Labour really
is different and worth a positive (not just anti-Tory) response.
If only Mr Blair can get his reform of Clause 4, the constitutional
commitment to nationalisation, in place next month, he would have a
really powerful symbol to go with the showbiz vigour. No need to fear us
any more: we have left the corporate state behind us. And we couldn't
possibly tax you more than the Tories have done already.
You can spot the game plan. Mr Blair wants to put clear blue (and I
mean blue) water between him and Mr Major and not, as the latter would
like it, the other way round. Labour has moved vastly to the right while
the Tories are stuck where they are, not daring to readjust to
right-wing Thatcherism.
Mr Blair is looking busy and thus creates a Tory tizzy.

Alan Clements and Graeme Bowman examine the recent transformation in
Philadelphia's fortunes and consider the lessons for the emerging new
Glasgow.
DECAYING infrastructure, shrinking tax base, declining industries --
sound familiar? In this case it's not Glasgow we're talking about, but
Philadelphia. In 1991 the city was officially bankrupt with debts of
$250m and a projected debt of over $1 billion by 1995. It is now rated
as one of America's success stories. But this new Philadelphia story is
not a romantic comedy but a hard-nosed thriller that left many of the
audience in tears. The question is, will the script play in Glasgow?
Credit for Philadelphia's transformation is due to the dynamic ''New
Democrat'' administration of Mayor Ed Rendell. Herb Vederman, deputy
mayor with special responsibility for economic development, has flown in
to Glasgow to participate in a BBC TV special* on Scottish local
government reforms which will see Strathclyde disappear and a powerful
Glasgow City Council emerge. Can the new Glasgow match Philadelphia?
Vederman has no doubts why Philadelphia succeeded. He lives and
breathes the city and left a highly successful business career to become
deputy mayor. ''Philadelphia was a mess. We were really close to failing
to meet our payrolls. We broke the unions and turned this city round as
a centre for the arts and tourism. Our transformation is a model for the
rest of America and cities throughout the world. And it is all down to
leadership.
''Ed Rendell runs the city as a business. All his closest advisers,
including me, are successful business people in their own right. I'm a
Republican, but that doesn't matter to Ed. All he wants is people who
get things done.''
Philadelphia is now one of America's top-rated cities both in terms of
quality of life and economic viability. The city has moved from imminent
bankruptcy to surplus, and Mayor Rendell has just granted Philadelphia's
1.6m citizens their first tax cut in more than 50 years.
But does Philadelphia's miraculous transformation offer any examples
to Glasgow's city fathers? And will the Labour Party and people of
Glasgow be willing to swallow some of the harsh medicine that was needed
to restore Philadephia's health?
The first strategy is a way to make sure suburbs pay for the city.
Philadelphia's wages tax is a unique way of tackling the ''doughnut
effect'' whereby affluent social groups vacate the city and move to
leafy suburbs, leaving behind a crumbling inner city core and a
shrinking tax base. Arguing that more affluent groups should pay for the
services they use during the working week, Philadelphia levies a wages
tax on everyone who travels to the city for work. This way the citizens
of the new authorities of East Renfrewshire, South Lanarkshire, Bearsden
and Milngavie would have to pay their share of Glasgow's costs.
The New Philadelphia is also introducing key housing reforms which
might be a model for Glasgow's peripheral estates. Vederman explains:
''Our public housing concentrated the poorest tenants in 'projects',
high-rise buildings which are dumping grounds for anti-social tenants.
These places are cesspools, riddled with drugs and crime. We have to
break those areas up. We have started by giving these tenants rent
vouchers which they take anywhere in the city in part-exchange for any
rent. In these buildings, anti-social tenants will face models of good
behaviour, people who go to work and don't do drugs. That way they will
aspire upwards, not feel that their current life is the only possible
one. It might not work for everyone, but we will be left with a 20%
problem rather than the 100% we have at present.''
Vederman also believes strongly in a leaner, fitter municipal
workforce. Under previous administrations, Philadelphia's workforce had
become too big for the city's needs, efficiency was low and costs were
high. The main instrument for curing these ills was market forces
introduced via competitive tendering.
About half of Philadelphia's public services are now provided by
private contractors but there has been no overall job loss. Public
employees' holidays are reduced to the same level as private employees
and the city took direct responsibility for administering its employees'
health and insurance fund, saving $100m per annum. The unions responded
with a public service strike but Vederman insists they gave way when
they realised they didn't have public support.
Other aspects of Philadelphia's regeneration will be familiar to
anyone who lived in Glasgow during the eighties. Like Glasgow,
Philadelphia was plagued with a negative self-image and the city has
taken steps to redress this problem. A key element of this has been the
Wednesday -- Make It A Night campaign. Frustrated by the
under-utilisation of public space in downtown Philadelphia on weekday
evenings, Rendell encouraged shops, bars, cafes and restaurants to stay
open late on Wednesday nights and offer special promotions. Affluent
suburbanites flooded back into the city for the first time in decades
and this has had a knock-on effect on other nights.
More ambitiously, through a partnership with private donors, the city
has raised $200m to transform a ten-block section of South Broad Street
into an Avenue of the Arts with nine separate arts venues. Ventures such
as this have helped redefine Philadelphia as a ''city of destination''.
Philadelphia, therefore, offers several models for Glasgow's urban
revival but these could only be introduced after much heartsearching in
the city and the suburbs. Is Glasgow ready for Philadelphia's story?

SYDNEY: Australians awoke yesterday to find their country divided into
five time zones instead of three. Some states have decided to cling to
daylight-saving summertime hours longer than others, causing widespread
confusion.
Queensland and New South Wales have turned the clocks back an hour to
be 10 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. However Victoria and Tasmania
are keeping summer time until March 26 to be 11 hours ahead of GMT.
South Australia is 10.5 hours ahead, Northern Territory 9[1/2] hours,
and Western Australia eight hours ahead.
Business leaders, tourist operators, and daylight saving supporters
have all condemned the fractured time zones, claiming they will cost
industries millions of dollars in lost revenue.

Bangkok, Sunday,
POLICE arrested 75 students with radio receivers in their underwear
today and charged them with conspiring to cheat in a Thai army college
entrance exam.
Police stormed the examination rooms at Ramkamheang university, on the
outskirts of the capital Bangkok, after the army college complained that
people were involved in a plot to cheat in the non-commissioned
officers' test.
More than 10,000 people were competing for 400 places.
Police seized 75 specially designed radio receivers hidden in the
underwear of students sitting the exam.
The suspects, who were also charged with illegally operating radio
devices, told police they paid 50,000 baht (#1300) each to a policeman
who sent messages to them from a transmitter.
The policeman who sent the signals was also arrested.
Those held face up to two years in prison if found guilty.--Reuter.

Kigali, Sunday
GUNMEN ambushed and killed a senior Rwandan official from the majority
Hutu tribe, brought into the Tutsi-led administration to reassure
millions of refugees they can return home safely.
Pierre-Claver Rwangabo, prefect of Butare and a key Hutu politician,
was shot dead last night on the road from Kigali.
At least five gunmen forced his car to stop by blocking the road with
a tree, then opened fire, killing the prefect, his son and driver.
Rwangabo is the most senior politician in the mainly-Tutsi government
to have been killed since Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels won a
three-month civil war last July, ending the genocide of up to one
million members of the minority Tutsi tribe and Hutu allies.
As a member of the Hutu majority, in opposition to the ousted Hutu
government blamed for the genocide, Rwangabo was named to run Butare to
assure Hutu refugees it was safe to return home.
The radio said an investigation was under way and pointed its finger
at the defeated former army, saying: ''Let us remember this despicable
act comes at a time when there is talk of the arrest of . . .
elements of the former army who were involved in missions to
destabilise the country.''
Five people were arrested in Kigali yesterday and officials said they
were from the former presidential guard, which played a leading role in
the genocide. Four others escaped.
The Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA), the army formed by the RPF, has
carried out a new wave of arrests, particularly around Butare, of those
suspected of involvement in the genocide.
More than 1000 people have been arrested each week recently. UN
special envoy Shaharyar Khan said 23,000 people were crammed into
prisons designed for 4000, effectively a death sentence as conditions
were so bad.--Reuter.

Never one to let an issue drop if he believes that officialdom is
trying to pull the wool over our eyes, Tam Dalyell has championed a
number of causes, from the Belgrano to Lockerbie, which the Government
would rather he let lie. And in the case of PanAm 103, he detects that
the sleeping dog is stirring, as Benedict Brogan reports.
MORE than 90 parliamentary questions tabled by Tam Dalyell are due for
answer in the Commons today. All of them deal with the bombing of PanAm
flight 103, the solved-yet-unsolved murder of 270 civilians in 1988. And
each answer will be carefully scrutinised for snippets of information by
the Linlithgow MP who, over six years, has become what he describes as
Professor Emeritus of Lockerbie Studies.
The campaign he has waged to force the British and American
Governments to reveal all they know on what he calls the greatest act of
mass murder since 1945 has become something of an institution in the
Commons. Dalyell, who prides himself on being a single-issue politician,
has raised the matter in every way possible, often to the exasperation
of his colleagues. But now his efforts are beginning to be rewarded with
signs that, almost imperceptibly, the ground under the Government's
position is beginning to give. ''There is a sea change under way,'' he
says.
No-one disputes the facts of what happened to the Boeing 747, bound
for New York just days before Christmas. A bomb hidden in a portable
cassette player stored in the hold exploded as the plane levelled off
over southern Scotland for its Atlantic crossing. The 259 passengers on
board died almost instantly, thrown into the cold night air at 31,000
feet. Another 11 people on the ground were killed when the remains of
the fully-fuelled plane landed on the town of Lockerbie.
The investigation into the bombing by Dumfries and Galloway police
took more than two years. In 1991 American and Scottish prosecutors
accused two Libyan intelligence agents of planting the bomb in a
suitcase sent unaccompanied from Malta to join Flight 103 at its origin
in Frankfurt. Arrest warrants for the two are outstanding. Despite
UN-imposed sanctions, Libyan dictator Moamar al Gaddafi refuses to
surrender the men. The Government says it is now up to the courts to
test the case against them. And there the matter stands.
But not for Tam Dalyell. From the outset he has questioned the
official version of events. With the relatives of the victims and a
number of investigative journalists, he has campaigned to expose what he
believes to be the political truth behind the case: that the attack was
the work of terrorists working on behalf of Iran, not Libya; that they
used an established American drug surveillance route to smuggle the bomb
on board; and that Margaret Thatcher helped the Americans cobble-up the
Libyan scenario to keep Iran and Syria on-side during the Gulf War.
His premise is backed by an intimidating amount of detailed evidence
which, though technically circumstantial, is multiplying doubts in
Whitehall and among senior figures in the Scottish legal establishment.
In December, he organised the screening of a new film on Lockerbie in
the Commons after Channel Four expressed doubts about showing it. The
Maltese Double Cross, by investigative journalist Allan Francovich, sets
out the labyrinthine alternative to the Libyan scenario. The film claims
American intelligence agents were on the scene of the crash within three
hours of the bombing, and more ominously, that American officials and
South African diplomats, including Foreign Minister Pik Botha, were
warned not to board Flight 103 at the last minute.
Tam Dalyell is convinced the new evidence has provoked signs of
wavering among Ministers. Most significant was Douglas Hurd's decision
last month to answer in person Dalyell's adjournment debate on
Lockerbie. Hurd said no new evidence had been produced to cast doubt on
Libya's involvement. But his presence was enough. ''With Europe, Bosnia,
and a range of other foreign policy dilemmas simmering away,'' Dalyell
says, ''it would have been understandable for the Foreign Secretary to
leave it to a junior minister.''
Ironically, in December junior minister Douglas Hogg had embarrassed
his boss and angered Tory back benchers by accusing Dalyell of behaving
''in a dotty'' manner. The ill-considered remark, in answer to a
question in which Dalyell explained he had just been granted 25 minutes
in private by Hurd to discuss Lockerbie, brought a rebuke from the
Speaker and private expressions of support from several Tory MPs. ''I am
very grateful to Douglas Hogg for having described me as dotty. It was
manna from heaven. His back benchers were appalled, he looked
bad-mannered, and it drew attention to what I was trying to say.''
Then, two weeks ago, recently resigned Scottish Office minister Allan
Stewart announced that he believes the case against the Libyans is weak,
and called for it to be reopened. The defection of an otherwise loyal
ex-minister encouraged speculation that the Government was finding it
increasingly difficult to hold the line.
With his shambling gait, non-existent fashion sense, and occasionally
detached manner, Dalyell is too often underestimated. But the tireless
campaigner against devolution is one of the sharpest operators in the
Commons. He does not follow political fashion, choosing instead to
pursue whatever line of inquiry takes his fancy. Be it science policy,
or the state of the Forth bridge, or the sinking of the Belgrano, he has
won admirers and frustrated colleagues in equal numbers with his dogged
persistence.
But six years on, does Lockerbie still matter? Here Tam Dalyell gives
an unexpected answer, and one that offers the best chance of persuading
the Government to change its mind. Forget about government
accountability, about the rights of citizens to be informed, he says.
British relations with the Arab world, commercial and otherwise, are at
stake.
''It is in Britain's self-interest not to alienate Libya, one of the
few remaining secular states in a region increasingly dominated by
Islamic fundamentalism. Sanctions cause harm to the Libyan people, they
harm British commercial interests, and they harm our nationals out
there,'' he says.
He also believes that the relatives of those who died at Lockerbie
have the right to the truth. His links with them are close. He speaks to
Dr Jim Swire, the tireless spokesman for the British families, at least
three times a week. ''The families might say that they couldn't have
kept going without me. It is equally true that I couldn't have kept
going without them,'' he suggests.
The answers he receives today to his 90-plus questions might not yield
very much. Most will receive stonewalling replies. Ministers continue to
insist publicly that, above all, they cannot interfere with Scottish
justice. But Dalyell hopes that buried in there somewhere today will be
another nugget, another fact to add to his overflowing files on the
subject. ''I am a great believer in something turning up. That's why I
have persisted. My colleagues leave it to me because my time scale, by
nature, is rather strange. I have never been interested in the following
morning's headlines. I work for the long term.''

Rome, Sunday
AN ITALIAN magistrate investigating bomb attacks on churches and
museums in 1993 says he believes the Mafia carried out two of them to
punish the Pope for condemning it.
Florence magistrate Pierluigi Vigna told reporters that the bombings
at the Cathedral of St John's Lateran and the church of San Georgio al
Velabro were most likely the Mafia's response to attacks by the Pope on
his visit to Sicily two months earlier, when he told Mafiosi to stop
spilling innocent blood in Sicily because they could not escape God's
judgment.
''The Pope was in Sicily and during that trip he read 18 speeches. He
defined people killed by the Mafia as martyrs and compared the Mafia to
the devil,'' Vigna said at a conference on the Roman Catholic Church's
role against the Mafia yesterday.
Vigna said that former Mafioso Salvatore Cancemi, who is co-operating
with police, told investigators he believed top Mafia boss Salvatore
Riina ordered the church bombings from his prison cell.
Riina, who comes from the Sicilian hill town of Corleone made famous
in The Godfather films, was arrested in January 1993 after nearly 25
years on the run.--Reuter.

Ulundi, Sunday
SOUTH Africa's main black opposition Inkatha Freedom party stepped
back from a political abyss today, ordering its members to return to the
Parliament they quit two weeks ago.
However, the mainly-Zulu party gave President Nelson Mandela a
one-month deadline to resolve a row on the constitution.
Inkatha officials said the party's three Cabinet Ministers, including
Inkatha leader and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, would
resume their governmental duties tomorrow.
A crisis conference on the party's future said Inkatha would boycott a
constituent assembly writing the country's post-apartheid constitution,
unless there was agreement on international mediation within a month.
Buthelezi led his party out of Parliament on February 21 after
accusing President Mandela and former president F W de Klerk of reneging
on a mediation agreement that had drawn Inkatha into last year's
all-race elections.
Buthelezi believes he will get a better deal from international
mediators.
The Inkatha walkout heightened fears of a surge in violence in
KwaZulu-Natal, where thousands of people have died in a decade of
fighting between Inkatha and Mandela's ANC.--Reuter.

Gaza, Sunday
ISRAELI Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat
today arranged a meeting for Thursday to try to break an impasse in
peace moves that Palestinians said were paralysed.
Saeb Erekat, in charge of local government in Arafat's Palestinian
authority, told reporters in Gaza: ''With the way the Israeli government
is handling this peace process now, it is going down the drain.''
Nabil Shaath, in charge of planning for the authority, said the PLO
would present its grievances to US secretary of state Warren Christopher
when he visited self-ruled Gaza during a Middle East peace mission this
week.
Ahmed Korei, in charge of the economy in the authority, announcing the
Peres-Arafat meeting, said: ''We will discuss the usual things --
expansion of Palestinian authority in the West Bank and redeployment.''
Talks on extending self-rule from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
town of Jericho to more of the West Bank were stalled after a January
suicide bombing by two Gaza men killed 21 Israelis near Tel Aviv.
Israel, which sealed off Gaza and the West Bank, preventing
Palestinians from working in the Jewish state after the bombing, began
issuing 3500 new permits today. This was on top of 15,000 new permits
distributed last month.
Israel says Arafat must control militants operating from his territory
before self-rule can be extended.
Israeli officials said they would not be satisfied until the PLO had
disarmed Hamas and Islamic Jihad -- Gaza-based organisations opposed to
peace with Israel -- and put guerrillas on trial before a new security
court it has set up.
However Shaath said: ''We are doing our best. Israel has clamped a
total paralysis on the peace process and this has had serious security
effects on the West Bank. They are simply refusing to negotiate
anything.''
He accused Israel of delaying talks on matters due to have been
implemented last year as part of the Gaza-Jericho accord.
PLO officials said the authority was angry at statements attributed to
Peres by the German magazine Der Spiegel yesterday that Arafat must show
more willpower to fight ''terror''.
Arafat had to show the will to bring the peace process along, Peres
said. ''If he is too weak to do that or lacks the will, why should we
negotiate with him at all?''
Yasser Abed Rabbo, a member of the Palestinian authority in charge of
culture, said Peres's statements were ''very dangerous . . . a violation
of the PLO-Israel accord''.
Security sources said Israel, in a goodwill gesture to mark the end of
the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, would allow Palestinians to unseal or
rebuild 40 houses sealed or destroyed by troops as punishment for
security offences.
* Yasser Arafat joined hundreds of mourners at the funeral of a
headmaster killed in a shooting incident in Gaza during which Israeli
and Palestinian security forces opened fire.
Secondary school headmaster Usama al-Borno, 41, was killed while
driving his car near a junction guarded by both forces close to the
Jewish settlement of Netzarim.
Israeli military officials said the Israeli and Palestinian security
forces were shot at from a nearby orchard and both groups returned fire.
They said more investigation would be needed to determine who killed
Borno.--Reuter.

Copenhagen, Sunday
AN AMBITIOUS United Nations summit opens tomorrow with the aim of
defusing what the UN calls a social time bomb primed by worldwide
poverty, injustice, and unemployment.
''It is a battle for the soul of the United Nations,'' Chile's UN
ambassador Juan Somavia said of the seven-day World Summit for Social
Development, which will attract 130 heads of state and government to a
two-day finale in Copenhagen.
Somavia, who thought up the summit, brushed away fears that it would
achieve little because of the magnitude of the problems and shrinking
foreign aid budgets.
''Changes come step by step,'' he said. ''The conference will at the
least sound a cry of alarm, present a vision of what a better world
would look like, and adopt firm commitments, the most important being to
eradicate poverty.''
The summit's goals also include a commitment to achieve full
employment with the emphasis on small enterprises, and relief of Third
World debt.
US Vice-President Al Gore, French President Francois Mitterrand,
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama, Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng, and South African President
Nelson Mandela will attend.
Notable absentees are President Clinton, John Major, and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin.
''Many rich nations hope that the issue will simply go away,''
complained Mahbub Ul Haq of the UN Development programme.
Since Clinton led the most world's most powerful nation, he said,
holding the summit without him was ''like playing Hamlet without the
Prince of Denmark''.
The Pope said today that he hoped the summit would convince leaders to
put the needs of people first.
''I sincerely hope that this meeting marks the start of a new phase in
the course of humanity in which leaders of nations put the wellbeing of
individuals and peoples at the centre of their attention and efforts,''
he said in his weekly address to pilgrims in St Peter's
Square.--Reuter/AP.

As Strathclyde considers its toughest budget in recent years, Frances
Horsburgh examines the problems confronting councillors.
AFTER a recent meeting with Scottish local authority leaders,
Secretary of State Ian Lang rather wearily made it clear that he
believed they were crying wolf yet again over their financial
difficulties.
Acknowledging the Government had delivered a ''tight'' settlement for
councils in 1995-96, he insisted there was no need for substantial
council tax rises or service cuts since the shortfall could be made up
from efficiency savings.
It is a claim which infuriated the man who has emerged as his main
protagonist over council spending. Labour Councillor John Mullin,
chairman of Strathclyde region's finance committee, said: ''I am fed up
to the back teeth of hearing this kind of talk from Mr Lang. There are
teachers in the classroom, home-helps going into people's houses, road
workers gritting the roads in winter, the police and fire service. I
challenge the Secretary of State to tell me how you can make these
people more efficient. They are working flat out at present.''
The 44-year-old, who has held the financial reins of Scotland's
largest region since 1987, is also convinced that Tory Ministers are
leaning unnecessarily hard on public borrowing and spending to put aside
a contingency fund which will be used to produce tax cuts nearer a
General Election.
Strathclyde's Labour councillors believe the region has been
especially hard hit. Already smarting over the planned demise of the
region under reorganisation in 1996, they are also aggrieved at what
they see as a savage pay-off for all the years in which they have acted
prudently.
The main problem for Strathclyde region is that the Scottish Office
has given it an individual capping limit of #1999.1m for next year but
its finance experts say that it needs #2106m to maintain its current
services after inflation and community care costs are taken into
account. This only allows an increase of 0.7% on 1994-95 and leaves the
region requiring cuts of #107m to stay within the imposed limit.
If it spent above it the Secretary of State could be expected to
intervene and order a reduction in the council tax which would produce
the required cut in revenue spending.
Strathclyde also believes it has been shortchanged over its allocation
of Government grant for 1995-96. In 1994 the Government agreed to
support its spending at a rate of 88.68%. The new settlement has reduced
this percentage level of support leaving an unexpected shortfall of
#115m.
After much agonising Strathclyde's Labour group proposed a budget
which contains just over #70m worth of cuts, substantial rises in
charges and a whopping increase in council tax of between 15% to 18%.
Despite the cuts agreed by Strathclyde, there is still a crucial
excess over the capping limit of #37m. The region hopes to bridge this
by transferring #45m of revenue spending into capital. This is spending
of a capital nature on the purchase of vehicles and making improvements
to buildings which has so far been financed by council tax payers.
Such a move, it is hoped, might keep the council tax rise to 15% which
would mean a #56-a-year rise on the average Band D payment. But the
crucial question is whether the Government will agree to accept such a
creative tactic.
The answer to that won't be known until April, after the Scottish
Office have scrutinised council budgets. If the Secretary of State does
refuse to accept the Strathclyde strategy, Councillor Mullin and
Strathclyde's convener Councillor Bob Gould are of a mind to test the
position in court.
His colleagues, he believes, will not vote for further cuts which, it
is claimed, would include the closure of 80 police stations, severely
damage community education, reduce pre-fives education by a third and
entail compulsory job losses.
''We are not prepared to go any further with service cuts. I think we
have a strong legal case and a very positive moral one.''
The view from St Andrews House, as might be expected, is a little
different and Strathclyde's role as martyr is certainly not accepted.
Charges of exceptionally unfavourable treatment are totally rejected.
Scottish Office sources point out that the year-on-year spending
increase for every region is 0.7%, so Strathclyde has not been singled
out in any way. Meanwhile grant is distributed by way of a formula
agreed with Cosla.
It has noted that Strathclyde has run up a large deficit of over #20m
this year as a result of funding staff pay rises for 1994 from reserves
and not, as the Government urged, from efficiency savings. Rectifying
this deficit must get first-call on the council's finances for 1995-96
as running a deficit budget is illegal.
When examined, the figures show that Strathclyde has received a
below-average increase in grant of 0.6%, but then some other councils
have received less.
So the region's financial fate will have to hang in the balance for
some weeks. Ironically Mr Mullin's political future is equally
uncertain. He decided not to stand for any of the 12 unitary councils
about to replace Strathclyde but he is on the Co-operative Party list of
potential parliamentary candidates.

FIFA has been urged to reconsider its methods of distributing tickets
to World Cup matches because they tend to penalise the fans of the best
supported sides, according to research at Aberdeen University.
The FIFA allocation to the four Irish matches at in the United States
in 1994 was only 13,000 but up to 100,000 Irish fans found their way in.
Most bought tickets from local and English ticket touts who were making
up to 1000% profit.
The research also discovered that Irish fans traditionally identified
far more intensively with televised British sides than with their local
clubs which was illustrated by the numbers who took flights and ferries
to support Celtic or Manchester United.
The findings are from research into the sociology of Irish soccer fan
behaviour and culture at the World Cup carried out by a team from the
university's sociology department.
They said football stadiums in New York and Orlando provided excellent
opportunities to assess the Irish fans. Research was also undertaken
with groups in Manhattan, who were in the main on package holidays, and
in the Bronx, Queens, and New Jersey where many supporters were already
living and working.
Researcher Mr Richard Giulianotti said that, like the Scots, Ireland's
fan culture was largely an extension of the Irish carnivalesque, of the
intimate social ''sessuin'' (a social gathering for drinking, music, and
conversation) and the ''craic'' (humorous banter).
As a result, unlike other international fans, the Irish had a very
broad age, gender, and social class composition. However, given the cost
of attending the tournament, it did favour the middle class.
The majority of the Irish supporters at the matches were from the
Irish community throughout America and the event was primarily a focus
for celebrating Irishness en masse rather than for supporting the
football team.
''In part consequence, Irish fans were not consistently involved in
interaction with opposing fans. Apart from downtown Orlando, there were
few public rituals of extended communication and exchange as one finds
almost stereotypically with the Scots (through friendliness) and the
English (through hooliganism),'' said Mr Giulianotti.
The researchers found little evidence to suggest that USA '94 was the
launch pad for the popularisation of professional football in the United
States. While it was an undoubted financial success, it failed to
capture the imagination of the American public generally.
Mr Giulianotti said: ''We would urge FIFA to reconsider its methods of
distributing tickets, which tends to penalise the fans of the best
supported sides. Finally, for the Irish, the tournament cemented the
national popularisation of soccer. It also underlined the game's
function in allowing the Irish to express non-political sentiments of
national and cultural identity.''

INDUSTRIAL action by nurses angered by their 1% pay award is becoming
increasingly likely, according to the public services trade union
Unison.
Unison's Scottish nursing committee will meet today to discuss a
response to the Pay Review Body's national 1% award but Mr Jim Devine,
senior regional officer, said yesterday that the offer would be rejected
and warned that it was ''highly likely'' that the union would ballot its
members on possible industrial action if an improved offer was not made.
A ballot would probably be held at the end of the month or the
beginning of April when the new financial year starts.
Mr Devine added: ''I think there will be an overwhelming 'yes' vote
for industrial action because the reports we are getting say there is a
lot of anger and resentment among nursing staff following this derisory
offer.''
Members of the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of
Midwives, the Health Visitors' Association, and the Chartered Society of
Physiotherapy are also angry at the pay award and are attempting to have
it improved.
Mr Devine said that, although the Government has offered a possible
additional 2% pay rise to nurses at local level, there is no guarantee
that this would be implemented and the message from the Scottish Office
is that there is insufficient funding for it in Scotland.
He said Unison firmly believed there should be national pay bargaining
and settlements, rather than such local increases, and officials may
seek a meeting with the Scottish Office to discuss the matter.
He added: ''Nurses should not be getting different rates of pay in
different trusts which are sometimes just a few hundred yards down the
road from each other, but the reality is that that could happen.''
In addition to its dispute over pay, Unison is also preparing a
campaign to highlight what it considers to be unacceptable conditions
faced by many of the 72,000 nurses in the Scottish health service.
Mr Devine yesterday condemned what he called the increasing
casualisation of nursing and, in support of the campaign, released
extracts from a nurse's contract whose conditions he said reflected ''a
1930s agenda of fear and intimidation''.
He said the contract, which was signed by a bank nurse at the West
Lothian NHS Trust, provides no statutory employment protection, no
entitlement to paid leave or sick pay, and no maternity leave.
''Individuals without this security cannot go to their bank for a
mortgage or a loan. This is a contract based on fear and exploitation
and reflects the bully-boy mentality that prevails in much of the NHS
today.''
A spokesman for the West Lothian NHS Trust based in Livingston said
bank nurses were contracted by a trust when a hospital has staffing
problems (ie to provide cover when staff are on holiday or sick leave)
and were paid only if they worked.
The present arrangements for bank nurses in West Lothian had been in
place since the trust was formed two years ago and it was ''thoroughly
mischievous'' of Unison if it was suggesting the trust had altered the
contracts of bank nurses.

Hong Kong, Monday
CHINA'S efforts to seat sympathetic politicians suffered a blow in
Hong Kong's elections when a former British missionary was unseated by a
fierce critic of Beijing.
Szeto Wah's convincing win over Mrs Elsie Tu in municipal elections
yesterday showed that Hong Kong's democrats were holding their ground
against pro-China politicians, who are growing stronger as China's
takeover of Hong Kong approaches in 1997.
Szeto, 64, helped found the Democratic Party, the largest
pro-democracy faction, and he often criticises China's human rights
record, making him a ''subversive'' in Beijing's books.
Mrs Tu, in contrast, opposed recent calls for greater democracy and
was rewarded with an invitation from Beijing to act as an advisor in
China's preparations for 1997.
Szeto beat 81-year-old Mrs Tu by 2397 votes in the working-class area
of Kwun Tong. The battle was closely watched because both candidates are
immensely popular and their views toward China so different.
''It's the battle of the century,'' one voter told Hong Kong
television.
With about two-thirds of results declared early today, Szeto's
Democrats had 16 seats and 10 defeats. Their main pro-China rival, the
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, had four wins and
two losses.
The Democrats say stronger democratic institutions will ensure local
control after China takes over. However the pro-Beijing camp says that
will only anger China's Communists and encourage them to break their
promise of a ''high degree'' of autonomy for Hong Kong after 1997.
Under rules devised by Governor Chris Patten against China's wishes,
all municipal councillors were for the first time elected yesterday.
China responded to Mr Patten's reforms with vows to disband Hong
Kong's elected bodies in 1997. However Beijing still backed pro-China
candidates in the polls, apparently to show that it has support in the
colony. Hong Kong's next polls, for the legislature in September, will
be the last under British rule.
Hong Kong's enthusiasm for democratic politics was evident from the
record 128 candidates who contested 52 seats, with seven candidates
uncontested.
Voter turnout was 25.8%, the highest ever for a municipal election.
After touring an election centre, Mr Patten said the poll was part of
a ''steady, unthreatening maturing'' Hong Kong that made him question
why Britain and China argued.
''You think to yourself, 'What's the fuss been all about? What's the
big deal?' ''
Alan Cheng, a banker, said he voted for the Democrats' Steve Chan in
the working-class area of Western because ''the British are leaving us
with a self-governing system. If we don't support it, then where is our
future?''--AP.

Sarajevo, Sunday
BOSNIAN Serbs allowed UN forces today to resupply isolated
peacekeeping units with food as Germany pleaded for a Balkan summit to
avert a relapse to total war.
Fresh sniper attacks by Serbs ringing Sarajevo underscored the gradual
erosion of a two-month-old Bosnia ceasefire due to expire on April 30.
Truce violations are increasing and rival factions have resumed
blocking UN operations. However Serb forces did allow a UN convoy to
reach a besieged government enclave to succour Dutch UN troops.
Bosnian Serb commander-in-chief General Ratko Mladic cleared the
convoy after the UN mission drafted plans to run the Serb blockade with
helicopters escorted by Nato jets.
Ten UN trucks carrying 30 tonnes of food arrived in the eastern pocket
of Srebrenica at dawn. UN spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Gary Coward said:
''Their situation is resolved, at least for the next two weeks.''
About 730 Dutch soldiers stationed in the mainly Muslim enclave had
less than two days' food left when Mladic relented last night and
cleared the aid.
The Serbs guaranteed free movement for UN aid operations under the
December ceasefire accord, but recently returned to blocking deliveries
to peacekeeping troops in three besieged government pockets.
Bosnian Serb officers said they were cracking down because the UN
mission was failing to ensure that the Muslim-led Bosnian Government
army complied with the ceasefire.
The truce was ignored from the outset in the north-west enclave of
Bihac, where two people were wounded by shells today.
Germany, voicing widespread international fear of a return to
full-blown war in former Yugoslavia, urged Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic to recognise Croatia and Bosnia and agree to a summit with his
Balkan counterparts.
''I call on President Milosevic to seize this chance for peace,''
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said. ''He is responsible for the
success of international efforts to turn the dangerous developments in
former Yugoslavia into something positive.''
Britain, France, and Germany, representing the Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia, last week failed to win over Milosevic to their latest peace
formula, which involves recognising Croatia and Bosnia.
Bosnian Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic arrived in London today
with a warning that full-scale war could break out in former Yugoslavia.
He was expected to argue that the Serbs should be given a deadline to
accept the plan or face tough consequences, including possibly lifting
the arms embargo on Bosnia.--Reuter.

BRITAIN'S ability to compete successfully with Germany would be the
critical factor in a Labour Government's decision whether or not to join
a single European currency, Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said
yesterday.
He reaffirmed that Labour was in favour of joining in principle but
stressed throughout an hour-long ITV interview that a Labour Government
would have to be confident that British industry could compete
effectively within a single currency area.
Mr Cook said a Labour Government would introduce measures designed to
improve economic performance including those needed to make British
business and banking more of an ''investment culture''. Such measures
would take time to make an impact and, assuming there was no election
before 1996, would be unlikely to make a significant difference to the
performance of the economy before the turn of the century.
Mr Cook said Labour would also press for the central bank which would
be set up under a single currency to be more politically accountable
than is currently proposed, perhaps reporting to Ecofin, the Finance
Ministers of the EU.
Mr Cook argued that Labour's position was clearer than the
Government's as it was saying that, if its conditions were met, it would
join a single currency.
If other countries were to go ahead without Britain, he said, there
would be disadvantages to the UK economy such as probably higher
interest rates because of the strength of the new EU currency. There
could also be an adverse effect on inward investment to Britain.
Such a decision would face a British Government with ''a very
difficult judgement'' on whether it could afford to be left out. But at
the same time, Mr Cook warned, the effect on employment and the future
of many firms would be severe if Britain entered a single currency unit
in an uncompetitive position as devaluation to improve export potential
would no longer be an option.
Mr Cook maintained the Labour leadership's position that national
consent for entry could be obtained either through a referendum or by
General Election in which membership was a major issue.
He conceded that not all votes for Labour in an election could be
construed as support for a single currency, if this had been decided
upon, any more than all Conservative votes could be taken to be against
membership. He said public consent had to be ''clear and unequivocal''.

FOOTBALLER Gordon Strachan last night admitted he had been a victim of
the property slump. With two friends he formed a company to buy a hotel
in a prime Edinburgh location when property prices were high during the
late 1980s.
However the hotel, called Yesterday's in St John's Road, Corstorphine,
is now empty and is on the market. Mr Strachan admitted, albeit tongue
in cheek, that the hotel's failure was one of the reasons he has had to
stay in football.
He described himself as ''one of Thatcher's victims'' and said his
venture into the hotel business had been a disaster.
Mr Strachan, who won more than 50 caps for Scotland as well as league
and cup medals in Scotland and England, said the hotel had been a gamble
that had backfired.
The Edinburgh-born player, who now helps with training at Leeds
United, said: ''We had plans to do all sorts of things with Yesterday's
hotel. Unfortunately, they didn't come off. It is a big place but now it
isn't used.
''I have lost money on it over the years but I'm not telling you how
much. I've still got enough money to put food in my fridge, but the
hotel failure is one of the reasons I stay involved in football. I seem
to be one of Thatcher's victims.''
When asked about the selling price for the hotel, he replied: ''Now,
now, that's a bit personal.'' Locals who spoke to The Herald believe the
property could be worth around #500,000.
The hotel sits in its own grounds and has a ''For Sale'' sign in the
window. A solicitors' firm next door now uses the hotel's car park as do
local shoppers. At Christmas, traders used the car park to sell
Christmas trees.
A company called Yesterday's Hotel Ltd was set up on January 28, 1988,
to look after the hotel and look at other business opportunites.
According to company accounts lodged up to March of last year the
directors are Mr Strachan, accountant David Ross and housewife Elizabeth
Munro.
A resident of a nearby property said: ''No-one can believe it hasn't
been bought over. Not many people are aware of Gordon Strachan's
involvement. I certainly haven't seen him here. Yesterday's was a really
good hotel but it's now just sitting there deteriorating.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Liberal Democrats, campaigning for the future of Highland
rail services, claimed last night that ''significant cracks were
beginning to appear in the earlier brick wall against consultation''.
Highland Liberal Democrat MPs cited two reasons for their optimism.
The first is a letter from Mr Roger Salmon, director of passenger rail
franchising, to Sir Russell Johnston, MP for Nairn and Lochaber.
In it Mr Salmon confirmed that he had received an assurance from the
British Railways Board, in respect of the Fort William sleeper and
Motorail service, that ''the necessary facilities and infrastructure to
operate the service will be retained until such time as a final decision
on the future of the service has been made''.
The Liberal Democrats said it was also now clear that the Rail
Regulator had asked Railtrack to hold the sleeper and Motorail slots
until the consultation process was completed.
The effect of these developments confirmed that there was a clear
assumption now being conceded that these services should be maintained
under the new timetable beyond May -- until a full and formal
consultation has taken place.
In a statement, the MPs, Mr Johnston and Mr Charles Kennedy, said:
''These are highly significant cracks beginning to appear in the earlier
brick wall against consultation.''

Workers at
Dundrennan gunnery range in South-west Scotland yesterday demanded
that an Army officer be reprimanded because he told them that most of
their jobs would go in six months, less than 24 hours after the Scottish
Secretary announced they had been given a three-year reprieve.
Mr Ian Lang said the workforce of 120 would be reduced to 90 but the
jobs would be safe for three years. Then they would be cut to six to
look after security on the range, which may eventually be taken over by
the Army for training.
However, the following day Colonel Roger Styles, who is responsible
for several ranges including Dundrennan, near Kircudbright, told workers
that the rundown could happen by October.
Mr Livvie Reid, the Transport and General Workers Union district
secretary at Dumfries, said: ''I have today received details from the
Ministry and I am more assured about the jobs. But I think the colonel
who came up and shattered the workers with his October announcement
should come back and apologise.
''If the colonel has misled the workers or has got it so very wrong,
then he should be carpeted and reprimanded. He has created a great deal
of worry for the workers and has treated them shabbily. These are
workers and not just a commodity.''
He said he had received more information but added: ''I am happier but
I require facts and figures before I will be content.''
Thousands of the depleted uranium shells have been fired at the
4500-acre range over the past 12 years.

A WATERED down version of Labour's original plans for English regional
assemblies is likely to be announced later this year. Local councillors
would be nominated to watchdog bodies supervising quangos and a
development agency in each English region.
This follows Labour leader Mr Tony Blair's decision to delay the plans
for the introduction of full blooded directly elected assemblies.
He said yesterday in a newspaper interview: ''There isn't a consensus
about regional assemblies in England and we can't commit ourselves to
doing that until it is clear that the support and pressure for that is
there. The whole purpose of this is to give power to people, not to
start shoving more layers of government on that they don't actually
want.''
Mr Blair said a future Labour Government would take steps ''to ensure
that the quango state created by the Tories is brought under proper
democratic control''
Mr John Prescott, deputy leader, admitted on BBC TV's Breakfast with
Frost that the policy was ''on hold'' while a review was carried out by
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw. This prompted Home Secretary Michael
Howard to claim that Labour were ''at sixes and sevens'' and ''in a
state of thorough confusion'' over the policy.
Certainly, the Labour leadership have taken note of Mr Major's attacks
on regional assemblies which he repeated at the weekend, saying they
would make Britain the most over-governed and bureaucratic country in
Europe with, in some areas, five layers of government from Westminster
through regional, county, district, and parish councils.
He claimed Labour's plans were ''farcical'' and ''a total shambles''.
The Opposition privately concede that the Conservatives might find
attacks on the idea of assemblies a useful weapon in most English
regions.
Although Mr Straw is still officially consulting and is not due to
make recommendations until June, he is expected to come up with plans
for nominated bodies of elected county and district councillors to
supervise quangos and regional government offices.
He is still considering adopting a step by step approach to elected
assemblies by which they would be set up in areas where there is some
demand, like the North-east, leaving other areas to come along later. An
all-London body to carry out strategic functions in the capital will
also be proposed.
The assemblies, if they are eventually set up, would not answer the
West Lothian question created by the establishment of a Scottish
Parliament as no-one is suggesting they would have legislative powers of
the kind proposed for the Edinburgh body.
As a Labour Government would find a large part of its first session in
power occupied with fighting Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly
Bills through Westminster, it would not want to repeat the process
immediately, especially as the leadership does not see regionalism as a
vote winner compared with other policies they plan to introduce.
But there is a keen regional lobby in the party. Mr Andrew Mackinlay,
MP for Thurrock, said he would be greatly disappointed if the
establishment of elected assemblies was delayed ''for more than a couple
of sessions''.
Mr Jeremy Beacham, Labour leader of Newcastle council, said regional
government already existed in England. The trouble was that it was
unaccountable.
More immediate bad news for the Conservatives was an assessment by a
BBC reserch unit that they stood to lose a record 1350 seats in the May
local elections in England and Wales, and could be placed third
nationally behind the Liberal Democrats for the first time in the
party's modern history.

Brussels
DOUGLAS Hurd will join other EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels today to
sign a trade deal between the community and Turkey. The EU has
negotiated a customs union agreement with the Turks which will clear the
way for Cyprus to become the sixteenth EU member state.
Ministers believe the move will provide a security buffer against
Islamic fundamentalism along the community's southern borders.
Turkey has sought closer links with the EU for many years, but its
efforts have fallen foul of Greek disapproval because of the
Greek-Turkish division of Cyprus.
The Greeks have recently been persuaded to soften their line in return
for Cyprus being allowed to start accession negotiations six months
after the conclusion of the 1996 inter-governmental conference which
will review the Maastricht treaty.
EU Foreign Ministers expect the Greeks and Turks on Cyprus to adopt
some form of federal government for the island so that both communities
can be treated equally. At present most of the world recognises only the
Greek part of Cyprus.
In return for dropping its veto on the Turks' customs union, Greece
was offered improved trading terms for its textile industry.
One diplomat said: ''This could be a historic occasion. We will have
at last a relationship with a great Nato ally to the south -- a
relationship that will hopefully set an example for the peoples of the
Caucasus and dissuade them from following the examples of Iran or Iraq.
''We have had a rather silly relationship with Turkey for a long time.
Monday should change that.''
The diplomat said the Turks would now be expected to begin ''living up
to the kind of things at which they have been hinting recently'' on
human rights.
The customs union deal is intended to open up trade in a wide range of
goods and services, unblocking up to #800m in aid and loans to Turkey
and -- in the much longer term -- moving the country closer to EU
membership.
Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is expected to sign the deal in
Brussels.
The foreign affairs council is also expected to place new conditions
on an interim trade package with Russia, due to come into effect next
month, in an attempt to persuade Moscow to improve its record with the
Chechens.
Ministers want an indication that the Russians are genuine in seeking
a new deal for the rebels and are willing to open access to humanitarian
aid in the area.

<TEXT>
ONE of the best-known and best-loved names in motoring will make a
welcome return this week when Rover unveils its new two-seater MG sports
car, the MGF.
The company takes the wraps off the 130mph car at the Geneva Motor
Show tomorrow and it will go on sale in the UK this summer.
Apart from a limited-production MG RV 8 launched in 1992, it is the
first new MG since the last MGB cars were built in Abingdon,
Oxfordshire, in October 1980.
Launched almost exactly 70 years after the first MG was introduced,
the new dynasty of MG sports cars is the result of a four-year
development programme.
Complete with the traditional eight-sided MG badge, the new car comes
in two versions -- the MGF 1.8i and the 1.8i VVC, which stands for
variable valve control.
Rover boasts that the sleek, powerful MGF is in the true tradition of
the marque.
Equipped with Rover's highly-rated K-series engines, the car comes
with an acrylic fabric hood which can be put up and down in a few
seconds. Drivers can also go for a black hard top as an optional extra.
The MGF is being built at Rover's factory in Longbridge, Coventry, and
Rover hopes to produce 20,000 vehicles in the first 12 months.
The 1.81 VVC can accelerate from 0-60 mph in seven seconds. Prices
will be announced later, but the 1.8i is likely to cost about #16,000
and the VVC version about #18,500.

<TEXT>
AS many as one in five children may be ''latchkey kids'' who have to
make their way home from school and look after themselves until their
parents return from work, according to the London-based Kids' Clubs
Network.
Its findings are quoted in a Scottish Consumer Council guide published
today which aims to raise awareness among school boards about
out-of-school care.
The council wants to encourage boards to tell parents about
out-of-school care and to establish if parents see such provision as
important.
Its chairman, Ms Deirdre Hutton, said: ''Recent cases of 'home alone'
children have disturbed us all, not least working parents for whom the
hours between 4pm and 6pm can become a nightmare.''
Parents who worked or studied faced big childcare problems, while for
many the challenges of finding childcare outwith school seemed
insurmountable.
These included parents of children with special needs, single parents,
and those living in rural areas or on low incomes.
Out-of-school care is provided by salaried, experienced, non-school
staff either in school or other community premises.
The main sources of funding are grants from Local Enterprise
Companies, urban aid, local authorities, and parents themselves.
The Government announced nearly two years ago extra funding for
out-of-school care.

STAFF at main post offices in the West of Scotland are on strike today
in protest at what their union calls the back-door privatisation of the
service.
Post Office management insist the overwhelming majority of post
offices will be open for business as usual, and yesterday called on the
union to put customers first and scrap the one-day strike.
It follows a similar one in December when Post Office management
conceded that 20 of their crown post offices in the West of Scotland
were to shut. The Communication Workers Union claims managers are being
drafted in from as far afield as London and Northern Ireland to staff at
least some of the offices. The dispute does not affect the rest of
Scotland or the hundreds of sub post offices.
The CWU asserts that more than 130 Scottish post offices have closed
since 1988 and that the day of action is part of its campaign to halt
further closures and sell-offs.
Local branch representative Mr Liam Murphy said: ''Closing down post
offices and then selling the franchises is a clear attempt at
privatisation through the back door. There is no public support for
selling off the Post Office.
''The public doesn't want it and neither do their elected
representatives in Parliament, as was recently demonstrated when Michael
Heseltine's Green Paper on the future of the Post Office was thrown out
by MPs.''
Management described the stoppage as misguided. Post Office Counters
general manager for Scotland, Mrs Wendy Goldstraw, said: ''We are
confident that the vast majority of our staff recognise that there is
nothing to be gained by this pointless industrial action and will work
normally. They have nothing to gain and it will only succeed in
inconveniencing customers.''
One of the concerns of the Communication Workers Union is that post
offices have been closed while services have been transferred to
supermarkets. However, Mrs Goldstraw claimed this improved services with
better locations, longer opening hours, and more convenience for
customers.
She said business at the new offices was growing faster than elsewhere
and it was a success with customers. Staff at post offices which were
closing were offered jobs elsewhere or ''generous'' redundancy terms,
she added.
Offices which could be affected by the strike today are Possilpark,
Hope Street, Crosshill, Gorbals, Govan, Castlemilk, Springburn, Bothwell
Street, Bridgeton, Duke Street, George Square, and Easterhouse, all
Glasgow; Chalmers Street and Hecla Avenue in Clydebank; and the main
offices in Airdrie, Ayr, Bellshill, Cambuslang, Coatbridge, Cumbernauld,
Dumfries, East Kilbride, Greenock, Irvine, Kilmarnock, Kilwinning,
Kirkintilloch, Motherwell, Paisley, Rutherglen, Saltcoats, and Wishaw.

TWO of the Ayrshire families whose seven children have been in care
for almost five years following allegations of ritual child sex abuse
will today be given the details and timetable of how their children will
return home.
Eight children, from three related families, were taken into care in
June 1990 after allegations that they had been the victims of a satanic
child sex ring, involving their parents.
Before police and social work investigations ended, almost 70 adults
and children were allegedly identified as participants, on the basis of
''confessions'' by some of the children.
What has since emerged is that some of the children were questioned
for 43 days in a row, for hours on end.
A policeman involved in the case said: ''By the time social work was
finished with them I'm not sure these kids even knew their own name.
''We can't question mass murderers the way these kids were questioned.
Somewhere along the line some social workers seemed to lose their basic
humanity and forget that at the end of the day the children were the
ones that should have come first.
''But it was obvious, some social workers wanted to be the first in
the world to expose a satanic sex ring. I suppose the thought of
promotion came into it but I think it had more to do with a personal
crusade.''
Last Monday, Lord Hope, Scotland's senior Law Lord, decided the
children should be returned home as quickly as possible after describing
the whole affair as ''a tragedy of immense proportions''. His decision
followed a year-long inquiry by Sheriff Colin Miller.
For the past week there has been feverish activity as two curators ad
litem, appointed by the court for each family, carried out
investigations and prepared their report for today's hearing.
The curators have the task of setting a timetable and method for
reintroducing the children to their families.
One family has not seen three of its four children since June 1990
when they were snatched by social workers. The youngest was only seven
months old at the time she was taken.
The second family has not seen its three boys since 1992 when access
to them was terminated by the Children's Panel.
An Ayr lawyer, Mr Michael Johnston, who has acted for the family,
called for an urgent inquiry into the affair last week and in particular
a report by one Glasgow newspaper that the three children did not want
to go home.
He said: ''This is yet another crime to be laid at the door of
Strathclyde social work.
''The reason these parents don't know their children is because
Strathclyde social work have fought every inch of the way to prevent
access.
''God only knows what tale these children will have to tell when they
are finally released.
''It was made quite clear in Sheriff Colin Miller's report that as a
result of deliberate manipulation and misinformation by social workers
to the Children's Panel, access was stopped to the three children.
''They even gave misleading information to their own expert
psychologist and psychiatrist. In the process the whole Children's Panel
process was subverted.
''These children were only aged 20 months, four and five, when they
were taken into care in 1990. So for most of their lives they have been
in the care of Strathclyde social work department and had no access to
their parents.
''So if they have any fear of returning home it must have been placed
in their minds by social workers or care workers employed by the
region.''
Miss Mary Hartnoll, Strathclyde's director of social work, has
confirmed the fears expressed by the children have nothing to do with
sexual abuse but are purely because the children do not know their
parents and do not want to leave the special unit where they live for
another home, unknown to them.
Glasgow lawyer Paul Burns, who represents the family of the four
children and is chairman of the Ayrshire Families Action Group, said:
''It is a salutory lesson to be learned by everyone, including lawyers,
that these parents who had been battered and abused by the system and
almost destroyed financially and emotionally, never lost faith in the
Scottish justice system. And in the end justice rewarded their faith.''
Mr Maurice Smythe, who represented the third family whose 15-year-old
girl was released from care last Monday after five years, said: ''Only
following the release of the little girl are we starting to hear what
went on while these children were in control of Strathclyde social work
department.
''Certain social workers and care workers have tried everything
possible to break the emotional ties between parents and children.''

RESIDENTS yesterday claimed a victory in their battle against a health
trust over its management of a maintenance fund.
A condition of the sale two years ago of the former health board
houses in Netherton Oval, in the grounds of Lennox Castle Hospital near
Glasgow, was that residents pay at least #135 a year into a maintenance
fund.
The Netherton Residents' Association claimed that about #12,000 of
payments remained unaccounted for and that only about #2000 had been
spent on repairs since the fund was established.
A solicitor for the residents claimed that the Greater Glasgow
Community and Mental Health Services NHS Trust had admitted that the
monies were going straight into a common fund used by the trust.
The contract involved the health board maintaining the water and
drainage systems, electricity for street lighting, roads, pavements, and
grass cutting in communal areas.
The residents' association had threatened legal action over the
matter.
But the association has since received a letter from the Scottish
Health Service Central Legal Office confirming that a separate bank
account is to be opened from April 1, in respect of the service charge
funds. Residents will receive quarterly statements.
The trust is also to undertake a historical accounting exercise of the
funds. It believes this will demonstrate that the amount spent on
services at Netherton Oval by the trust and previously the health board
is in excess of the amount allowed for when the service charge was
calculated.
Mr Finlay Dow, chairman of the residents' association, said yesterday:
''The trust's setting up of a separate account for the maintenance fund
is a victory for us given the resistance against such a move in the
past.
''However, we remain dubious over what happened to the major part of
our contributions and plan to take this matter further.''

A HOMEMADE remedy which, its inventor claims, turned no-hope
greyhounds into winners is now being sold to humans for pain relief.
Former miner Mr Bill Bates, developed his so-called Wonder Cure lotion
after his greyhounds, Moorfield Slippy and Lucky Lass, kept losing on
the track, limping home in races with tightened muscles.
After being rubbed down with his secret lotion -- which sells at #5 a
bottle -- Moorfield Slippy has won three trophies and Lucky Lass a
couple of races, Mr Bates claimed.
Now people suffering with aches and pains from rheumatism, lumbago,
and sprains are purchasing bottles of the milky liquid.
Mr Bates, 55, from Grimethorpe, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said:
''After the success with the dogs, I first tried it on my 80-year-old
mother, who suffered from arthritis in her knees.
''It used to take her ages to get moving in the morning. Now she rubs
the lotion on to her knees and can get up straight away.''
He said he mixed the lotion -- the ingredients are a closely-guarded
secret -- in his kitchen, and it was bottled and labelled by his
girlfriend.
He added that he has sold bottles to customers as far afield as
Germany. He also claimed that one customer, a 70-year-old man, cycled 20
miles from Dewsbury last weekend to buy some.
Pensioner Lilly Parker, 82, of Athersley South, Barnsley, said: ''I
suffered with backache for more than 40 years but thanks to the mixture
I'm without pain.''
Mr Bates claimed his success was now too much to handle and he was
willing to sell the secret formula.
''It started as a hobby but has now grown out of all proportion. I've
hardly made a penny out of it because I have to buy all the ingredients
and the bottles.
''But I will sell the idea to anyone willing to take over the reins
and they can manufacture Wonder Cure themselves.
''There is great potential. There are thousands of people wanting this
lotion and I'm just not geared up to supply them.''

SCOTTISH businesses are being handicapped by Government regulations on
long-distance transport, according to a report published this week.
The study, by Dr Alan McKinnon of Heriot-Watt University, says
companies are already disadvantaged by Scotland's relative peripherality
within the UK and Europe.
He notes that more than two-thirds of Scotland's exports leave from
English ports, which tends to lengthen journey times, reduce convenience
and increase cost.
Dr McKinnon calls for a more liberal regime in airfreight traffic and
deep-sea shipping, and a review of lorry weight restrictions, arguing
that changes in the regulations could lead to lower overheads for
business.
The report was commissioned by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, and
will form the basis of the agenda for their national transport
conference, to be held in Glasgow later this month.

<RECORDNO>979534066</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A GENETICIST at Glasgow University yesterday called for a pilot study
into the birth defects appearing in Gulf war babies.
In Britain four children of Desert Storm soldiers have been born with
deformities, 12 wives of the veterans have suffered miscarriages, two
had stillbirths and five children were born with severe respiratory
problems or low resistance to infection.
Dr Roger Sutcliffe of Glasgow University said there was a rate of
pregnancy failure and abnormality in newborn children in any population.
But he said there were factors which increased the percentages, such
as the atomic bomb's effect on the population of Nagasaki and Hiroshima
and the high rate of pregnancy failure and birth defects in some Eastern
European countries where there are high levels of pollution.
No-one, he said, should be surprised that pregnancy failures and birth
defects were appearing in the families of Gulf war veterans. The key
question was the frequency at which they were occurring.
''A study would ask questions such as how many soldiers' wives were
getting pregnant, how many were bearing normal children and how many
babies were born with birth defects and compare this with the population
as a whole,'' he said.
''There is a potential biological link between the Gulf war and the
outcome of pregnancies in service families.
A Manchester solicitor, Ms Hilary Meredith, is leading the fight for
compensation for Desert Storm veterans in Britain and says suspected
Gulf war baby cases are just beginning to emerge here.
''We need more people to come forward so we can establish a clear
picture,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>Abortion row resurfaces with new Bill in Ireland</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979534067</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Irish parliament is braced for a fierce debate this week on
abortion.
The new Abortion Information Bill will be voted on in the Dail on
Wednesday.
It will ''stem the flow'' of Irishwomen seeking abortions in Britain,
Irish Justice Minister Nora Owen said yesterday. Last year, more than
4000 women from the Republic had abortions at British clinics.
Pro life groups and Roman Catholic bishops have condemned it, while
the largest opposition party, Fianna Fail, is split over its approach to
the Bill.
It is aimed at making information on abortion services abroad
available through doctors. Under the terms of the new legislation,
doctors will be able to give women contemplating an abortion the names
and addresses of clinics but will not be permitted to arrange abortions.
The Bill was introduced by the three-party government last week to
give effect to the results of a 1992 referendum. Voters decided by 60%
to 40% in favour of making abortion information available while at the
same time they voted against legalising abortion in the Republic.
The new Bill has threatened once again to raise the abortion
controversy in the Republic.
The Justice Minister said: ''This Bill sets out to honour the
commitment given in the 1992 referendum.
''This Bill is about giving information in accordance with the
European Convention on Human Rights to services available lawfully in
other countries, no more and no less.''
The Minister added: ''This Bill for the first time will outlaw
abortion referral for the first time. I believe this Bill will ensure
that we will reduce the number of abortions being sought across the
water, that should be our aim.
''We have made a commitment to extra resources. Those elements of the
Bill are very, very vital in the Government's approach to try and stem
the flow of people leaving this country to have abortions, the tragedy
of it.''
She added: ''The doctors cannot just give information now about
abortion. They must give counselling and advice about the other options
open to a woman who finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy.
''We should be humane about this. We should be trying to assist women
avoid making the decision to have an abortion.''

THE SNP's Roseanna Cunningham has been reinstalled as favourite to win
the Perth and Kinross by-election. Her decision to re-enter the fray
earned a tumultuous reception from the party's national council at the
weekend.
She will now contest the selection procedure in Perth on Thursday
against three other candidates who want to carry the SNP torch in a
by-election in which the party is expected to take the seat from the
Conservatives.
It was Harold Wilson who coined the phrase during the sterling crisis
of 1964, but Ms Cunningham found it appropriate to employ during a
speech to 400 of the party faithful in Stirling on Saturday.
''A week is a long time in politics and I guess I have found out how
long a week can be. I've managed to get through.''
The week had started with the advocate entering last Sunday's initial
selection procedure as firm favourite, only to emerge rejected after a
furious attack on her personal life in which party president Winnie
Ewing played a major part.
By Monday it had become clear that a high-place party leak meant the
details of a relationship 18 years ago with the separated husband of the
then Mrs Margaret Bain -- now the president's daughter-in-law -- were
going to fuel tabloid headlines, and Ms Cunningham withdrew from the
selection contest.
Although the party hierarchy admitted Ms Cunningham was unfairly
treated and had done nothing wrong, they accepted that resignation as a
personal decision.
Ms Cunningham holds the environment portfolio in the party's Scottish
Cabinet and ran the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn to within just over 2000
votes at the last General Election, therefore to protect her future as
one of the party's brightest talents a public gesture of support was
promised.
That came on Saturday, when she was called to second a motion by
leader Alex Salmond on party strategy. The response from the floor -- a
thunderous ovation -- confirmed the increasing feedback she had been
receiving towards the end of the week urging her to insist on her right
to stand.
She added: ''I have had a tremendous ammount of support from Alex, who
has been on the phone whenever I needed him. As a result of what has
happened this week, I have made a personal decision to ask the national
executive if they will discuss this afternoon having my name on the
short leet.''
Mr Salmond yesterday welcomed her back on to a short leet she is now
firm favourite to win. ''By the end of the week she had concluded that
the story about her private life was dead and buried,'' he said. ''She
was right.
''I can only admire the grit she has shown in bearing up to events of
the last week and her performance at national council.
''Margaret Ewing has also behaved with great dignity over the last few
days and both have enhanced their standing in the eyes of both fellow
activists in the SNP and the public.''
And what of Mrs Ewing senior. Madame Ecosse was not commenting over
the weekend, but her initial reaction indicated shock, and she must now
ponder that her role in the affair has, if anything, strengthened the
hand of Ms Cunningham.
* The SNP leadership yesterday dismissed claims in a Sunday newspaper
that an electronic listening device had been found in the room where
last weekend's selection meeting was held.
Party chief executive, Mr Michael Russell, confirmed that a search for
such a device had been carried out as a preliminary step in the
investigation which will be carried out into press leaks on the affair,
but this had proved negative.
''The party's inquiry is, therefore, likely to proceed on the
assumption that the information which appeared in the press came from a
party member.''

THE much-loved dolphin is a bully, a mugger, and a killer.
Conclusive proof can be seen on BBC1 on Thursday when footage of
Scotland's bottlenose dolphins will show them tossing harbour porpoises
in the air.
Scientists have suspected for around two years that there was another,
more sinister side, to the dolphin.
Last year, when Scottish Agricultural College vet Harry Ross examined
dead porpoises washed ashore, he said he believed their severe injuries,
including crushed ribs and ruptured organs, could have been caused by
dolphins ramming them.Now the proof exists.
The remarkable film was shot by Cromarty dolphin watchers Mike Haycox
and Bill Fraser, of Dolphin Ecosse.
The Moray Firth dolphins have been ''adopted'' by thousands of animal
lovers across the country who yearly flock to see them in the wild,
cruising the Cromarty and Moray firths.
They will be shocked to learn that the human-friendly dolphin is a
bully in his own world.
Mr Haycox shot his first ''attack'' footage from the shore at Chanonry
Point, Fortrose. He did not realise what he had until the film was
examined by an Aberdeen University team based at Cromarty Lighthouse.
He said: ''It was only then I found out the victims were porpoises.
They told me I had made history.''
The second breakthrough came when Mr Fraser, an expert on the
movements of the mammals, got film from less than 10ft of dolphins
tossing a porpoise in the air five or six times.
Mr Fraser, who has received a Scottish Tourist Board award for his
work with the dolphin-loving public, said: ''We don't know why the
dolphins do this, but you have to remember that the natural world can be
a very cruel place.
''The dolphin has a different accoustic system from the porpoise and
it may be that interference has something to do with it. Or it may be
territorial or feeding disputes. A lot of research will have to be done
to try and find the answers.''
The programme, Local Heroes, the first in a three-part series called
Operation Survival, will be screened at 8pm on Thursday.

THE hard-up Laird of Great Bernera, Count Robin de La Lanne Mirrlees,
has sold his Austrian castle at a knockdown price to help pay his
massive Lloyds debts.
It was revealed last month that the 70-year-old former Queen's Herald
had put five of his Scottish islands, one of his two castles, his villa
in Le Touquet, France, and his Paris flat on the market to raise #2m.
The count ran up huge debts after being exposed in 40 Lloyds insurance
syndicates and suffering big losses in a fish farming venture. He had
already sold his seven-bedroom Holland Park home in London for #750,000
pounds and auctioned antique furniture and silver to help pay the debts.
In addition, the count's phone was cut off because he could not pay
the bill.
Now the count, who lives in a simple croft house on the Hebridean
island of Great Bernera, has sold Ratzenegg Castle, near Villach, for
half of its #500,000 asking price.
It has been bought by an unnamed Austrian, who has allowed the count
to retain a holiday flat in the fourteenth century castle for the rest
of his life.
The count has also had offers for the tiny islands of Berisay and
Flodday off the Western Isles. The two islands were on the market for a
combined #50,000.
''I am very grateful for the gentlemanly and sympathetic way I have
been treated over my financial situation,'' said the count, who was once
worth millions after inheriting three family fortunes.
''I have had dozens of letters from all my friends since the
publicity, saying the same thing. I am being pressed so hard by Lloyds
that I had to accept the offer for Ratzenegg, even though it is half the
asking price which was aimed at a quick sale anyway.
''But the gentleman who has bought the castle has very kindly allowed
me to stay on in a little flat. Ratzenegg has been a favourite place for
my holidays for many years.''

SAFE houses are turning away a growing number of battered wives in
Scotland.
Last year, 2495 women and their 3422 children could find no refuge
because safe houses were full.
Now officials of Scottish Women's Aid are appealing to councils for
cash assistance to ease the plight of young families on the run from
violence.
During 1994, the organisation gave support and information to 19,014
victims -- an increase of 20% over the previous year.
It was able to offer shelter to a further 2757 women and their 4230
children in neighbouring districts.
National worker Evelyn Hay said yesterday: ''In order to meet the
needs of abused women, we need cash support.
''We receive only 78% of our budget from the Scottish Office, but the
work is under-resourced.
''This year it's vital that we raise more than #56,000 to make ends
meet and we hope councils will decide to help out.''
Scottish Women's Aid runs a network of 38 affiliated groups, helps to
fund resources for children, and offers a 24-hour advice service.

THE European Commission yesterday denied reports that it was backing
legal moves against the British Government which, if successful, could
mean a multi-million pound damages award for Sinn Fein leaders,
including Mr Gerry Adams.
Mr Adams is suing the Government in a test case at the European Court
of Justice in Luxembourg. Judgment is expected later this year.
He claims the Government denied him his right as an EU citizen to
freedom of movement when it barred him from the British mainland.
Restrictions on Mr Adams's movements were recently lifted after a period
in which the Prevention of Terrorism Act was invoked to stop him
travelling.
A newspaper claimed yesterday the commission had ''backed'' Mr Adams
in a formal report to the Court of Justice but an official said this was
not true.
The commission had reported that Mr Adams used a double passport. If
he was using a British passport, his movements were a matter for the

<HEADLINE>New crew 'could be Bulgarian SAS'.  MP's warning on ship strike</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEN SMITH</BYLINE>

A SCOTTISH MP has told the Foreign Office that Bulgarian special
forces, masquerading as sailors, may be attempting to enter Britain to
end the strike by the crew of a Bulgarian factory ship in Shetland.
The striking crew, who claim that they have not been properly paid for
three years, have asked local police for protection.
MP Jim Wallace says that one of the crew members described the special
forces members as ''hit men.''
Mr Wallace, Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, will meet
Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg this week to discuss the situation.
He wants immigration officials to check the status of replacement
crewmen being sent to the Rotalia, which is currently occupied at
Lerwick by the 26 striking crew members.
In telephone calls to friends and family in Bulgaria, the striking
crewmen have been told that three of the new crew being sent to take
over the ship may be working for the Bareti -- the Bulgarian version of
the SAS.
Although some of the crew have used emotive language such as hit men,
their general concern is that they will either be forced to go to Russia
or will be severely punished by the law on their return to Bulgaria.
This was denied by the Bulgarian ambassador to Britain, when he met
trade union leaders last month who expressed their concerns for the
plight of the crew.
During the long dispute, which has left them penniless, the seamen
have been supplied with food and clothing by Shetlanders.
The Rotalia is owned by the state company, Okeanski Ribolov, which has
now been partly privatised. Allegations have been made in Bulgaria that
some state companies are deliberately being run down so that they can be
taken over cheaply by groups linked to organised crime.
The Rotalia's acting captain, Sava Alexsiev, and ship's doctor, Hristo
Dimitrov, have said that they fear ''provocations and confrontation''
when the new crew arrives, and have asked for police protection.
A police spokesman said that they could not become involved in an
industrial dispute, but would certainly try to keep the peace.
Dr Dimitrov said: ''Our government thinks we are not a good example
for other Bulgarian people. If we win, maybe many other ships will go on
strike and much money will go out of the hands of the privatisation
people who have taken over our company. For them we are very bad news.''
The Bulgarians stranded at Lerwick have been in communication with the
International Transport Workers' Federation. The federation's inspector,
Bryan Allen, said yesterday that he expected anyone linked to the
Bulgarian special forces to be stopped by the Government immediately on
landing.
A Home Office spokesman in London said: ''Obviously their immigration
status will be checked on arrival. If we have any special concerns,
further inquiries will be made.''

THREE people escaped from a blazing house in Dunfermline yesterday.
Ms Pamela Horstmann 30, her son Gary, nine, and a friend, Mr Alan
Nicol, 35, jumped from upper windows after the fire started in the
downstairs living room of her council house in Wedderburn Street around
8am.
Gary got out through a skylight, crossed the roof, and jumped 15ft to
the ground, injuring his leg. He crawled to a house five doors away and
neighbours there called the emergency services.
Divisional officer Duncan Collingwood, of the Fife Fire and Rescue
Service, said: ''They were lucky. Had this happened during the night, I
think we would have lost the three of them. The fire caused a lot of
damage.''
Ms Horstmann and Mr Nicol had jumped from a bedroom window into the
garden. The family's collie died in the blaze.
All three were released after treatment at the Queen Margaret Hospital
in Dunfermline for the effects of smoke inhalation and minor injuries
sustained when they jumped.
Mrs Lorraine Bruce, who lives across the street, said: ''I looked out
of my bedroom and could seen nothing for flames. They were billowing out
of every window. Gary was screaming and hysterical. He had actually
crawled along the pavement and they thought at first his legs were
broken.''
A possible cause, investigators said, was sparks from a coal fire.

AN elderly woman was killed and six other people injured yesterday in
a two-car crash near Aberdeen.
The lunchtime accident blocked both lanes of the main dual carriageway
between Stonehaven and Brechin, at the Midtown of Barras turn-off.
The dead woman was aged 87. Police said her identity was being
withheld until relatives had been informed.
She was a passenger in a Peugeot travelling north. The car was being
driven by Ms Elizabeth Russell, 46, of Laws Cottages, Kingennie, near
Monifieth.
She was released from hospital but two other passengers, Mrs Jessie
Thomson, 72, of Farm Cottages, North Grange Road, Monifieth, and Ms
Marion Russell, 78, of Caenlochan Road, Dundee, were detained in
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary last night.
A hospital spokesman said Ms Russell was stable, but no condition was
available for Mrs Thomson.
The other car was being driven by Mrs Sheena Anderson, 49, who was
accompanied by her husband Bruce, also 49, and their daughter Nicola,
24, all of Northfield Crescent, Edinburgh.
They suffered minor injuries and were released from hospital after
treatment.

SCOTLAND'S first health trust yesterday unveiled plans to use a
private company, chaired by a former Conservative Party official, to
improve its service to patients.
The project will enable the purchase and operation of a #1m magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) facility at Ayr Hospital, part of the South
Ayrshire Hospitals NHS Trust.
It will make Ayr the only district general hospital in Scotland to
boast a full-time service in MRI scanning.
Ayrshire Medical Support will buy and run the MRI equipment. The
trust, which will build and lease the premises, will use its funds to
support the project, and has appointed two of its directors to the
company's board.
Sir Donald Maclean, an optician in Ayr, has been named as the third
director and chairman of the company. He is a former president of the
Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association.
Trust chairman Mr Douglas Brown said that the new equipment should be
operational from October 1.
Sir Donald said Ayrshire Medical Support would be having discussions
with staff at Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, and with Dumfries and
Galloway Health Board, to offer them the MRI service.
He stressed that the service would operate through the NHS, and there
was no question of individual patients having to pay.
However, Mr Brian Donohoe, Labour MP for Cunninghame South, said: ''If
anybody wants a lesson in how to privatise the NHS, then come to
Ayrshire.''

POVERTY is forcing Scottish university students to juggle degree
studies with work, according to new surveys presented to the Association
of University Teachers in Scotland (Auts).
It is feared the crisis will cause a decline in the quality of student
degrees and a higher drop-out rate amongst students unable to cope.
Students at Edinburgh and Aberdeen universities and Queen Margaret
College in Edinburgh were surveyed by their student unions. Their
findings, which reveal a marked increase in the number of students who
have to take on jobs during term time, were debated by Auts members at
their annual council meeting in Glasgow University on Saturday.
Members condemned the ''appalling increase in poverty'' among students
and called for an increase in financial support to allow students to
''concentrate on their academic studies without resorting to working
during term-time.''
Mr Peter Breeze, national president of the association and a lecturer
at Glasgow University, said that until recently it was unheard of for
students to miss lectures and skip course work because they were out
working.
Mr Breeze claimed the problem was caused by the failure of the student
loans system and the low-level of grants. He warned that the knock-on
effect would force students to cram for exams in a bid to pass rather
than fully learn their subject.
He said: ''We will get more and more students desperate to find out
what the exam is for revision purposes, rather than learning their
subject. That will lower the quality of graduates.
''We are also getting evidence, albeit anecdotal, of students
completing their first year at a good standard then simply not coming
back because they can't keep body and soul together.''
Lecturers are also on a collision course with university
vice-chancellors over proposals to substantially alter their salary
levels.
A discussion document issued by the University and Colleges Employers
Association (Ucea) proposes a modified salary scale, and attacks
collective bargaining, the association claims. The proposals, if
implemented, said Mr Breeze, would be tantamount to a ''declaration of
war''.
He warned: ''Under the new proposals it would take 100 years for
someone to climb from the bottom of the salary scale to the top'', since
a move to a higher grade could only be justified by proven
enhanced-performance.
The association is to lobby vice-chancellors over the proposals and,
if that is unsuccessful, said Mr Breeze, then industrial action could
not be ruled out.
* A report by Manchester University's Centre for Education and
Employment Research, published today, suggests that six 18-year-olds out
of every 10 will go to university, 30% more than the Government allows
for in grant allocations.

A CLIMBER swept 400ft down a mountain after being caught in an
avalanche in the Cairngorms said yesterday he was lucky to be alive.
As Mr Richard West recovered in hospital, he recalled how he had
previously told his daughter that avalanches were a ''million-to-one
chance''.
Mr West, a television engineer and father-of-three from Enfield,
London, was part of a six-strong group of climbers, under the guidance
of two instructors, hit by the avalanche on Saturday in Coire Laogh Mor,
near the Cairngorm ski centre.
The group were just hours into their three-day course when they were
swept down the mountain in a slab avalanche.
The incident was seen by an avalanche expert just yards away, who
raised the alarm on a mobile phone. A mountain rescue leader said the
fact that rescuers were on the scene so quickly prevented a far more
serious outcome.
One of the instructors, Mr John Lyall, 33, of Kincraig Manse,
Kincraig, a well-known and experienced climber, suffered a serious head
injury in the fall. He is still in Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, with Mr
West and Mr Raymond Beckwith, 45, of Littleborough, and Mr John Davis,
58, of Colne, both Lancashire.
Another instructor, Jill Nisbet, 43, of Craigie Avenue, Boat of
Garten, and three other members of the party -- Kathie Cutter, 43, from
Padfield, Derbyshire; Mr Timothy Ellison, 36, from Nigg Kirk Road,
Aberdeen; and Mr Andrew Harrison, 30, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire --
were able to walk from the hill.
The incident was the latest in a spate of accidents in the Scottish
mountains that has seen 13 deaths already this year.
The Scottish Avalanche Information Service had warned that avalanches
were likely in the northern Cairngorms, Lochaber and Glencoe.
Mr West said the group were just a few yards from the top of the
coire, practising ice axe and crampon techniques, when they were
suddenly swept away: ''The whole thing just seemed to give way and we
were taken almost right to the bottom. I dived on my ice-axe to try to
get a grip, but it was no use.
''There were some boulders jutting out on the way down and I remember
bouncing off them. I think four of us hit them. We were all wearing
helmets, and I think that is what saved our lives.''
He was knocked unconscious and came round to find the other seven
lying around him on top of the snow and someone moaning in pain. The
force of the avalanche had ripped his glasses from his face and he
suffered a fractured right foot, a sprained left foot and severe
bruising to his arms.
''When I woke I could not move. But I remember thinking, even though I
couldn't do anything, I was alive and that we had been very lucky.''
Mr West, who has three children, was able to call his family to tell
them he was all right. He added: ''We went skiing in France last year
and I told the kids that avalanches were a million-to-one chance. So,
when I called last night, the first thing my daughter said to me was 'I
thought you said it was a million-to-one chance'.''
He said that when the party set off on Saturday morning the weather
was fine and the sun was shining, but conditions deteriorated rapidly.
He was not aware there had been avalanche warnings.
Steve Blagborough, a member of the Avalanche Warning Project, was
taking a course in the area and saw the avalanche from 100 yards away.
He alerted police via his mobile phone then went to the climbers' aid.
Other climbers in the area and the Cairngorm ski patrol also went to
the scene and administered first-aid. An 18-strong party from Cairngorm
Mountain Rescue Team were also quickly on the scene.
The weather was by then so poor that an RAF Sea King helicopter was
unable to get near the scene. Rescuers battled blizzards and visibility
down to almost a yard in places to get the four most badly hurt climbers
on to stretchers.
Using stretchers fitted with skis, the four were then slid down the
hill. Mr Lyall and Mr Davis were flown to Inverness by the helicopter,
which returned to pick up Mr West and Mr Beckwith.
John Allen, leader of the Cairngorm Rescue Team, said: ''If no one had
witnessed this, it could have been much, much worse.''
''The casualties could have been lying around for hours and it would
have taken longer to find them in deteriorating weather.''
Blyth Wright, of the Scottish Avalanche Information Service, said:
''There was a considerable risk of avalanche in the Cairngorms.
''People going into these areas have to be very careful as to what
route they choose, to prevent something like this going wrong.''

LABOUR has demanded that the Defence Ministry reveal the cause of the
crash of an RAF helicopter which wiped out Ulster's top anti-terrorist
team last June.
The Chinook aircraft ploughed into a hillside 10 miles from
Campbeltown, killing 25 military, MI5 and senior police officers. All
were leading figures in the fight against IRA and loyalist terrorism.
Four crewmen also died.
No summary of the findings of the RAF accident board of inquiry has
yet been published, although the Ministry issued a statement within days
of the disaster saying that sabotage was not suspected.
Motherwell MP Dr John Reid, Labour's armed forces spokesman, said:
''It seems to be taking an inordinate amount of time to wrap up this
investigation, given that the experts ruled out terrorism almost
immediately.
''A 10-month wait for an explanation on an issue of great public
interest and potentially of safety for others is unacceptable. It must
also lead inevitably to speculation on the reasons for the MoD's
silence.
''If there is nothing to hide, then why the delay? I would also like
to know why 25 top security experts were put at risk in the first place
by being crammed aboard a single helicopter on a low-level flight in
mountainous terrain.''
He added that if it happened ''because defence cost-cuts were
responsible for lack of alternative transport, then the Government has a
great deal to answer for''.
A Ministry spokesman said: ''The investigation is still on-going. It
is difficult to put an average time on any aviation accident inquiry.
But there is, in any case, no obligation on MoD to publish a summary of
findings where security might be jeopardised.''
The Chinook was flying at 500 ft when it crashed into the side of 1300
ft Beinn na Lice on the Mull of Kintyre. The recommended minimum height
for any aircraft crossing the hilly area is 3000 ft.
The aircraft, carrying the leading members of Ulster's Tactical
Co-ordination Group, the body responsible for co-ordinating clandestine
operations against terrorism, was supposed to have been heading for Fort
George, near Inverness.
Its passengers, including the head of the RUC's Special Branch; the
head of the RUC's covert operations unit; six members of MI5; eight
other RUC officers; and nine military intelligence personnel, were
alleged to have been bound for a security conference covering a renewed
IRA bombing campaign on the mainland.
When it hit the hillside and cartwheeled for several hundred yards
before exploding in a fireball, it was under full power, virtually
ruling out engine or gearbox failure.
It was also apparently flying deliberately below radar detection
height on a general course and direction which would have taken it to
the remote military airfield at Machrihanish 30 miles away, rather than
to Fort George.
According to the RAF Secretariat at MoD in Whitehall, all British
military helicopters carry an altitude transponder, which enables the
pilot to maintain a safe height in darkness or bad weather. For security
reasons, RAF flight plans do not contain height details, so the
Chinook's progress would not have been recorded. Nor do RAF helicopters
carry black-box flight recorders. The final moments of passengers and
crew may well remain cloaked in mystery as a result.

A WITHERING attack on the loss of principle in the Labour Party,
characterised by the stifling of debate and intolerance of dissent, has
been launched by veteran Scottish activist Jimmy Allison.
The criticisms come in his autobiography, to be published on Friday,
the day Labour leader Tony Blair addresses a Scottish conference to
persuade delegates to amend Clause 4 of the party's constitution.
In what is seen as a struggle for the soul of the party, the
devastating contribution from a life-long activist, who served as
Scottish organiser between 1977 and 1991, will electrify the debate.
In the first of three exclusive extracts in The Herald, Mr Allison
claims serious errors by leaders in London and Scotland -- Mr Neil
Kinnock and Mr Donald Dewar -- coupled with the serious illness of the
party's Scottish secretary, Mr Murray Elder, brought about the disaster
of the Govan by-election in 1988.
It was, he writes ''with the great benefit that hindsight gives, the
end of the road for me in the Labour Party.'' By that, he means not just
that the loss of Govan to Jim Sillars of the SNP was an organisational
disaster, but that it marked the beginning of a trend.
Labour has become since then, he argues, more London-based, more
arrogant, more dictated by image, less concerned with basic principle
and belief, and less tolerant of dissent and internal debate.
As a critique of the road the party has travelled down to reach the
destination of New Labour, it is devastating. He has called the book
Guilty by Suspicion, a title with McCarthyite overtones reflecting what
he sees as the way the traditional left of the party has been treated in
the stampede towards modernisation.
As such, the book and the timing of its publication are bound to
attract accusations of disloyalty at best, sour grapes at worst.
Mr Allison said yesterday that as someone who was happy to dish out
criticism, he was quite happy to take it, provided people gave his
opinions a fair hearing. He was also prepared to take criticism from
''good Labour Party members that I respect'', but there will be those
who ''have tried to torpedo me in the past''.
When he was ousted amid a bitter internal struggle in the party
hierarchy in 1991 his salary was safeguarded until his 65th birthday --
a so-called golden gag which effectively prevented him from giving his
side of the affair publicly. Since his retirement date on December 13,
1993 he has been technically free to speak: the book is the result.
His views on the issue of New Labour will not be dismissed lightly.
Under the leadership of Neil Kinnock, he writes, ''internal debate was
not welcomed.''
He was asked ''to be like most other Labour Party officials who are
just puppets and would obey every command without question. But that was
not my style and was not the kind of party that I had worked in for many
years.''
The party style, concentrating on external image and internal
repression, was marked during the Gulf war when general secretary Larry
Whitty banned all debate on the rights and wrongs of Britain's stance.
The approach continued under the late John Smith and now under Tony
Blair, whose plan to change Clause 4 is, he believes, a mistake and an
insult to the electorate.
''If this makes me a cloth cap socialist, or even old fashioned then
so be it,'' writes Allison. ''It is often stated that if you wait long
enough everything comes back into fashion.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair was yesterday accused of ''moving the winning
post'' after rejecting the hypothesis that, were the SNP ever to win a
majority of the country's parliamentary seats, it would amount to a
mandate for independence.
The criticism came after a televised comment in which he said: ''I
don't think that in itself it would amount to a mandate for independence
at all.''
His message in an interview on BBC2's Scottish Lobby was:
''Decentralisation is sensible, separation is daft, and no change is
untenable -- that is a summary of where we are in Scottish politics.''
It was put to him that the Prime Minister had indicated that he
accepted the argument that SNP victory in more than half of Scottish
seats would amount to a mandate for separation, but he replied: ''I am
not sure that he is saying that. I don't think that in itself would
amount to a mandate.''
Pressed on the fact that Scots were seeking to progress by the
democratic process and therefore needed a winning post in sight which
amounted to a mandate, Mr Blair said: ''What I am saying to you is this,
that I don't believe the mere fact that they do that means that you now
say, well, that's it, Scotland goes its separate way.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond, who recently received in writing from Mr
Major an acceptance on the mandate question, said he was astonished that
the Labour leader was not accepting this. ''It is a blunder of enormous
significance which will come back to haunt him.
''At a time when even John Major accepts the right of the Scottish
people to decide their future, for a Labour leader apparently to deny
that obvious point is an act of total folly. The trouble seems to be
that Tony Blair cannot accept that Scotland is a nation, as opposed to
just another region of Britain.''

MOST of the collapsed Barings bank is to be sold to the Dutch ING
banking group, it was agreed last night.
Under the deal, ING ''will immediately supply #660m in cash to enable
Barings' business operations to resume trading normally'', a joint
statement said.
One of the main stumbling blocks for the sale was thought to have been
the payment of bonuses totalling #105m due to Barings executives.
Prospective suitors have been reportedly outraged by the attitude of top
brass at the bank.
The announcement of the sale came as concern grew about alleged ''lack
of control'' at the top of the crashed bank over the disastrous dealings
in Singapore by futures trader Mr Nick Leeson, 28, now in a German jail
awaiting Singapore extradition papers. According to the Singapore
Business Times, he said in a fax from Kuala Lumpur to his Singapore
office on February 24 that he was near a nervous breakdown, and tendered
his resignation.
The agreement followed what a spokesman for the administrators had
called ''extremely complex'' talks involving ING and another Dutch
banking giant.
ING said it was ''delighted'' to announce agreement in principle with
the joint administrators of Barings, Mr Nigel Hamilton, Mr Alan Bloom,
and Ms Maggie Mills, of Ernst &amp; Young.
This was ''to acquire substantially all the businesses, assets, and
liabilities of the Barings Group, including the businesses of Barings
Brothers &amp; Co bank, Baring Securities, and Baring Asset Management
operations.''
The agreement was subject to approvals from regulatory authorities,
including the Bank of England and the Dutch Central Bank, as well as the
relevant securities authorities, the statement said. The deal was also
subject to the approval of the High Court, to which the administrators
would apply today.
A key message to Barings staff, worried about their jobs, said: ''The
agreement is supported by the management of Barings, and ING's intention
is to retain the jobs within Barings.''
Chairman Peter Baring welcomed the agreement.
Meanwhile, Labour is to step up its campaign for an independent
inquiry into the collapse amid claims by Frankfurt lawyer Eberhard Kempf
that forgery charges levelled against his client, Mr Leeson, were
''thin''.
The party's City spokesman, Mr Alistair Darling, is to demand a
further statement from Chancellor Kenneth Clarke today as it was now
clear, he said, that suggestions the crisis was the work of one rogue
trader did not stand up.
He said it was imperative that the Chancellor gave a detailed account
of the background.
''It is now also clear that there are broader policy implications
following the collapse. It is not only the bank's management but also
the role of the Bank of England as supervisor that is open to
question,'' he said.
''That is why we need an independent, not an in-house inquiry.''
Analysts suggest there could be a ''clean sweep'' of the Barings
boardroom at Bishopsgate if culpability is established at the top of the
bank amid the growing crisis caused by Mr Leeson's catastrophic
derivatives gamble.
As the Serious Fraud Office and the Bank of England stepped up their
investigations into the crisis, Singapore premier Goh Chok Tong was
quoted as saying it was ''essentially an internal problem within the
Baring group, a lack of control''.
The investigators were studying reports that executives of the crashed
bank transferred #800m from London to back the gamble by Mr Leeson.
Such a sum is almost twice the bank's pre-crash capital and many times
the top amount permitted by the Bank of England for one activity.
It would mean that Barings contravened the 1987 Banking Act under
which banks licensed by the Bank of England are forbidden to use more
than a quarter of their assets for any one single purpose without proper
authorisation.
If it substantiates the claims, the Bank of England could impose
swingeing measures, including the suspension of directors, controllers,
and staff.
A news conference in Singapore at the weekend heard that, according to
a document released by Price Waterhouse, Barings' head office poured
about #549m into supporting Mr Leeson's futures bets in the months of
January and February alone.
The initial charge against Mr Leeson is that he forged a document
confirming the payment of #50m into a Citibank Singapore account in the
name of Baring Futures.
His German lawyer said he expected Singapore authorities to present
more information this week to the Frankfurt court in an attempt to
incorporate new allegations into the extradition request.
A lawyer from London law firm Kingsley Napley is expected to arrive in
Frankfurt this week.
Singapore has 40 days to make a formal application to Germany for the
extradition of Mr Leeson. Mr Kempf said the dealer would rather be moved
to England but British officials have not sought his extradition.
At the weekend investigators from Simex, the Singapore International
Monetary Exchange, told a news conference the bank was warned as early
as 1992 of potential problems.
In particular, warnings were given about concentrating too much power
in the hands of Mr Leeson, just as he was about to take up his posting.
A letter from Barings's Singapore chief Mr James Bax, dated March 25
1992, read: ''In my view, it is critical that we should keep clear
reporting lines and if this office is involved in Simex, then Nick
should report to Simon (Jones, a Barings director) and then be
ultimately responsible for the operations side.''
The letter went on: ''My concern is that once again we are in danger
of setting up a structure which will subsequently prove disastrous and
with which we will succeed in losing either a lot of money or client
goodwill, or both.''
The news conference also heard that Barings was told seven months ago
that Mr Leeson wielded too much power and was inadequately supervised.
Barings has said it first learned of the problem on February 23, the
day Mr Leeson left Singapore for neighbouring Malaysia.
