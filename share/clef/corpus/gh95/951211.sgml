Nottingham Forest 1,
Aston Villa 1
STEVE Stone rescued Nottingham Forest's unbeaten home record yesterday and
stopped Aston Villa climbing to third place in the table with a spectacular
equaliser just seven minutes from time at the City Ground.
Dwight Yorke's tenth strike of the season two minutes after the break had
looked like giving under-strength Villa a deserved victory, having been the
last Premiership side to win at Forest back in January, 15 league games ago.
But just when Forest looked set for a dismal defeat, Stone pounced on a short
pass from Jason Lee after skipper Stuart Pearce had played the ball forward up
the left. He ran in before crashing a 20-yard shot into the top far corner.
Stone, hoping to win his third England cap against Portugal tomorrow night,
ensured a repeat of the scoreline when these two East Midlands rivals met just
seven weeks ago. Now, as then, Villa were feeling aggrieved at the result.
They started without the considerable presence of Irish international trio Andy
Townsend, Steve Staunton and Paul McGrath, called up to prepare for Wednesday's
Euro '96 play-off against Holland. Yet they were comfortably the better side
for most of the 90 minutes.
Yorke smartly finished off one of the game's few cohesive movements in the
forty-seventh minute, taking Savo Milosevic's pass on the end of a build-up
which also featured Tommy Johnson and Mark Draper, to comprehensively beat
keeper Mark Crossley.
It looked set to complete a depressing day for Forest, with manager Frank Clark
dropping winger Ian Woan after the player had been quoted in a newspaper
article saying that the side had no chance of winning the UEFA Cup, having been
drawn against Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals.
But their unquenchable commitment finally salvaged a point and their ninth
league draw of the season.

Lee, Haaland, Howe, Bart-Williams. Substitutes - Phillips, Silenzi, Irving.
ASTON VILLA - Bosnich, Charles, Wright, Ehiogu, Southgate, Scimeca, Taylor,

DON'T put your daughter on the stage, Mrs Worthington. Or so the song says. But
many parents ignore Noel Coward's advice and bid to advance their children's
career in the forlorn hope that talent scouts won't notice that the child can't
act, can't sing, and is no Mona Lisa.
Showbusiness parents are bad, but sporting parents are frequently worse.
Witness the fathers who, weekly, roar at puny 10-year-olds from the touchline,
oblivious to the fact that the child would patently far rather be engrossed
with Super Mario. The team coach would probably prefer it, too.
Or the swimming parents who drag their infants from bed at the crack of dawn to
train while they relax and read their newspapers at the poolside and dream of
glory.
Of course, there are many sporting parents who genuinely delight in their
offspring's enjoyment in a particular sport and are endlessly supportive. And
then there are the tennis parents.
They exist in a world apart. Often they see their youngsters as a road to
riches, particularly if they can hold a racket and have a semblance of
co-ordination. These are the ones who have no qualms about sending the would-be
champions off at a fragile age to be coached by the current tennis guru in
Florida or California.
But consider what happens to so many of these impressionable teenagers who set
off on the road to stardom, pushed by parents from hick towns who hanker after
the bright lights - for themselves. Often they burn out, having missed a normal
childhood. They can't make it on the circuit or are unable to cope with the
hothouse atmosphere once they get there. The Jennifer Capriatis and Tracey
Austins.
But if you're planning ahead, then here's some advice. If you want your child
to make it to the top of the financial tree in sport make sure you have boys,
invest in a rack, and emigrate as soon as possible. For a list of the 40
richest athletes reveals some important pointers.
The three Bs - basketball, boxing, and baseball - are the best way to mega
riches. If you want your child to make the kind of money that makes the
National Lottery look like small change these are the ones for you.
Michael Jordan, the legendary Chicago Bulls basketball star, topped the
earnings list for the fourth year running. He may have put his bat and glove
down this year, but he still managed to keep his grip on $3.9m from playing and
a phenomenal $40m from royalties and endorsements. Not too many footballers in
that league over here. That's an awful lot of Reservoir Bhoys T-shirts or even
Gazza skip caps.
In 89 seconds, Big Bad Mike Tyson punched his way to $25m in his comeback bout
against Peter McNeeley in August and so catapulted himself to second place.
Mind you, that's in marked contrast to another boxer, who lost in the eighth
round of a bloody contest in Las Vegas a few days earlier. Iran Barkley's take
was $250 plus room, board and airfare home.
Baseball and football player Deion Sanders, the only two-sport athlete on the
list, who picked up a $13m signing bonus from the Dallas Cowboys, vaulted to
the third spot. `Neon Deion' was only thirty-eighth last year.
So perhaps parents should get the rack out early and start stretching their
babies. Wean them on steroids and get them jumping and jabbing as soon as
possible. For the list is dominated by the three Bs.
Tennis starts to figure in seventh place in the form of Andre Agassi, and his
compatriots, Pete Sampras and Michael Chang, also gained a place, as did Boris
Becker.
Plainly, there is a case for moving to America, for the list is dominated by US
athletes. But British names stick out - there aren't any. The highest-placed
European is the racing driver Damon Hill loves to hate, Michael Schumacher.
The old stalwarts of golf, Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, are in the $14m
range. All these golf course designs must pay, because their earnings from
playing were negligible.
But the most important fact for parents is to make sure their children are
boys. For the mega-rich athletes of the world are almost exclusively male. A
lone woman made it on to the list in thirtieth place - Steffi Graf volleyed her
way to $7.5m.
But a word of warning: make sure the child prodigies pay their taxes. For
several retired baseball players are currently being chased by the American
taxman. Their crime? Failing to declare income received for signing autographs.
The three Bs - basketball, boxing, and baseball - are the best way to mega
riches

IN various frozen and inhospitable and parts of Europe many of football's most
treasured possessions were required to play the game despite the treacherous
conditions of pitches last midweek.
These footballers were forced to perform but not because the authorities were
anxious to have them thrill audiences.
The motives were far removed from aesthetics or any desire to enhance the
game's appeal with money the only reason players were sent out to risk serious
injury in the various European competitions. Juventus, Steaua Bucharest,
Borussia Dortmund, and Rangers to name only a handful, were told to play their
Champions' League matches on surfaces which were obviously unsuitable.
All because the game has sold itself to television.
The millions of pounds put up by various broadcast-     ing companies
throughout Europe speak louder than any voices of reason within UEFA and FIFA,
who are top heavy with people who have become too detached from the game itself.
They have forgotten what a joyous and uplifting experience a football match can
be as they posture and preen themselves because so many sponsors want to offer
financial support.
They forget the players are the stars and without them there is nothing.
Strange then that a group of gentlemen who constituted an inspection party
should wander around the Westfalen Stadium in Dortmund one bitterly cold
morning last week checking the facilities.
The dugouts were fine, the nets fastened to goalposts in regulation style, and,
no doubt, the VIP seating area was acceptable, too.
However, the pitch was hard and unyielding. Or, in the parlance of the
footballer himself, the pitch wouldn't take a stud, which is the same as saying
the game should not have gone ahead.
That European tie, and many others throughout the Continent last week, ought to
have been postponed although there was never any likelihood of that.
Haven't, you heard by now, this is the entertainment business and the show must
always go on which is probably why one of the group at the Westfalen Stadium
said after his brisk walk around the facility: ``Yes, of course, the game is
on. The pitch is fine.''
It wasn't, and the players of both Borussia Dortmund and Rangers knew as much.
The hardest task was to stay upright and when you see players with the poise
and balance of Karl Heinz Riedle, Brian Laudrup, and Andreas Moller stepping
tenderly, but still falling, you just know conditions are wrong.
All of the players knew they would have to play - no-one would ever dream of
asking them whether the pitch was safe - and it is to their credit they managed
to put on a decent spectacle. That they escaped serious injury was down to good
fortune and nothing else, certainly not the wisdom of UEFA, who, like every
other football association in the world, answer more and more to television.
Anyone who doubts the power of television only has to look at that point where
the centre line meets with the main stand touchline next time a major match is
about to kick-off.
The referee dare not blow his whistle until a television person, standing at
the side wearing a headset and carrying the obligatory clipboard, drops an arm.
In these modern times the ball starts rolling only when the satellite orbiting
in the heavens drifts quietly into the proper position.
There is no turning back, of course, because the game has become dependent on
the wealth which TV companies are willing to hand out for rights to show
tournaments and the desire of the administrators to have football shown in as
many countries as possible is not an unreasonable one.
Often, though, one has to wonder and worry about where it will end because as
the price rises so, too, does the insensitivity of those who are supposed to be
the game's guardians.
When players who cost more than the entire budgets of some small countries are
risked because the cables, cameras, and audiences are in place surely that is
enough to prove priorities have become confused.
Without the players there is nothing to sell and the least UEFA and FIFA should
insist on is that every club which wishes to play in the glamorous and richest
competitions must be able to produce playing surfaces which do not represent
threats to the teams.
Dortmund, for instance, should have undersoil heating even if the Bundesliga
does close down for the winter.
In fact, the German championship went into hibernation at the weekend, but
their game against Rangers last week was staged on a surface on which the
intricate manoeuvre of the footballer was practically impossible.
The German champions are not short of money and, like Rangers, made millions
from the Champions' League.
Before they or any other German club play again next year in Europe they should
be instructed to dig up the turf and put an undersoil-heating system in place.
Even if they don't care for the safety of their own they should not be allowed
to endanger visitors.
The most powerful adminstrators in world football have been assembling in Paris
for tomorrow's World Cup qualifying draw and they could do something to make
the people believe they really care if they were to discuss issues like this
one.
Then again, however, the draw, while vitally important to billions, is a place
for opportunists.
It is a time both to form and undermine pacts. Power games will be played in
the corridors and corners of Paris's finest hotels.
The draw itself will be no more than a little entertainment, a distraction for
the strikers concerned about the French government's proposed welfare reforms.
Chaos has been brought to Paris by the strike, but football's administrators
probably haven't noticed while being transported in limos from one champagne
reception to another.
If the strikers are not too rowdy or obtrusive and refrain from waving placards
in the faces of FIFA president Joao Havelange and his entourage they might get
lucky.
They might just be thrown some cake, but the great unwashed should go carefully
while the World Cup draw, which will be staged in the Louvre, is unfolding.
They should be aware that few are allowed to get in FIFA's way.
Like the players, the people themselves sometimes are shown little more than
contempt by those who control the people's game.
Naturally, the draw, which will be lavish in its production, will be beamed
live throughout the world, so a little hot-blooded demonstration of unrest
among Paris' workers was never going to be allowed to prevent the show from
taking place.
Of course, FIFA fervently hope the strike will have been resolved in time for
the finals in 1998 because then people must be earning money so that they will
be able to pay the exorbitant prices of the tickets.
From Paris many of the administrators will move on to Birmingham where next
weekend the draw for the final stages of European Championship finals will be
played out. More champagne and fine cuisine. More whispering between mouthfuls.
Life for some is one big social whirl while the players and the public stand in
the cold outside with their noses pressed up against the dining-room windows.
They forget the players are the stars. Without them there is nothing

<HEADLINE>Charlton's final throw of the dice in Euro showdown  Irish may gamble on playing Sheridan</HEADLINE>

EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP
JACK Charlton is considering taking a huge gamble by playing midfielder John
Sheridan in Wednesday's European Championship play-off showdown with Holland at
Anfield.
The Republic of Ireland manager watched Sheridan's comeback from injury for
Sheffield Wednesday against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday and
later talked to the player, who will join up with his Irish team-mates today.
Sheridan, who missed last month's 3-0 defeat in Portugal and home win over
Latvia a month earlier, appeared as substitute on Saturday, his first
Premiership match since a knee operation to repair a torn cartilage six weeks
ago.
Charlton says he probably will not name the team until the day of the match,
but a fully-fit Sheridan must be a strong candidate for the midfield anchor
role Charlton believes is fundamental to his side's success.
Skipper Andy Townsend is back from a foot injury to resume his familiar
marauding role in midfield, but Manchester United's Roy Keane will not be there
to cover his captain's forward runs having not fully recovered from his latest
hernia operation.
With striker Niall Quinn also out through suspension, the odds are stacked
against Charlton's ageing squad. The Dutch, who knocked Ireland out of the
World Cup finals in the United States, have finally started to hit form again
after surprise defeats by the Czech Republic and Belarus.
Dennis Bergkamp, currently in great form for Arsenal, looks set to beat a calf
injury and take his place in the side, playing the link-man role behind
strikers Ronald de Boer and Patrick Kluivert.
UEFA have confirmed that if the match is drawn, a sudden-death extra time
period will be played, with the first goal decisive. If still level after an
additional 30 minutes, the teams will take part in a penalty shoot-out.
q.GARETH Southgate could provide the unexpected answer to England's midfield
dilemma against Portugal tomorrow night.
The 25-year-old Aston Villa player looks set to become the fortieth player
capped by manager Terry Venables as he copes with the loss of David Platt,
Robert Lee and Jamie Redknapp from the hub of his squad.
Treating it as a dress rehearsal for the sort of mini-crisis he could face in
next summer's European Championship finals, the England coach has decided not
to reinforce his 20-man squad with any late call-ups.
``This is what the competition in the squad is all about,'' he said yesterday
as he contemplated a Wembley recall for Newcastle defender Steve Howey and a
first start for Nottingham Forest's Steve Stone against one of next summer's
strongest qualifiers.
With UEFA limiting next summer's squads to 20, plus an additional goalkeeper,
versatility is becoming Venables' watchword. That looks certain to turn
adversity into opportunity for Southgate.
Now he can slip neatly back into his old role, alongside an on-trial Paul
Gascoigne in the middle of the pitch, probably flanked to his left by Steve
McManaman with the impressive Stone on the right.
There is no question of Gazza being punished twice for his recent
indiscretions, including a Champions' League dismissal, though Venables is set
to remind all his squad of the importance of discipline.
``You've got to be really professional in tournament conditions,'' he says.
``You can't afford to think only about your own feelings.'' Probable team:
Seaman (Arsenal), G Neville (Manchester United), Adams (Arsenal), Howey
(Newcastle), Le Saux (Blackburn), Southgate (Villa), Gascoigne (Rangers), Stone
(Nottingham Forest), McManaman (Liverpool), Barmby (Middlesbrough), Shearer
(Blackburn).
q.DUNCAN Ferguson will loom menacingly over Everton's stand-in strike force
tonight when he returns to the fold against West Ham at Goodison Park after his
enforced absence of over three months.
First, the Scot, who has not played first-team football since the second match
of the season against Arsenal, underwent a hernia operation. Then he spent 44
days in Barlinnie prison, and finally was required to serve a 12-match ban -
also the result of his on-field assault on Raith Rovers defender John McStay in
April, 1994.
Everton, believing it unfair that #4m Ferguson should be punished twice for the
same offence, successfully applied last week to have the remaining seven
matches of the suspension put on ice pending a full judicial review in the new
year.
Ferguson is back in the frame after one reserve outing, putting the pressure on
the men currently leading Everton's front-line, Graham Stuart and Daniel
Amokachi.

Langholm 11, Kelso 46
LANGHOLM coach Jake Little will seek improvement to his team's defence against
opposing miss-moves and full back intrusions following their concession of
seven tries, five of them admittedly to a pacy Kelso back division, under the
glowering mist and low cloud at Milntown.
Whereas Kelso gave several glimpses of quickfire handling, Langholm were unable
to stitch together similar handling threats and tended to punt ball that
invited handling spread.
Langholm's scrummage stood the strain until cumulative fatigue late on and made
the cleaner lineout catches although Kelso were more adept at gathering in
ricochets.
Kelso also had quite an advantage in the use of detached forwards, but the most
influential factor was the sharpness with hand and foot of the Kelso backs.
Ian Fairley's rounded display occasionally underlined Langholm's fringe defence
frailty. Scott Tait, a cousin of the Rugby Union and Rugby League international
Alan Tait, made varied impact not least with 21 points from two tries, four
conversions and a penalty goal.
The burly inside centre, Ben Mannion, took some holding and there were neat
little skills from Kevin Utterson before he retired with a leg knock.
Colin Turk potted Langholm's two penalty goals but was not always spot-on in
option choice and it was typical of Langholm's general punt format that their
wings seldom had the ball in space, whereas Jim Thompson had a key role in four
of Kelso's tries and Steven Ross compensated for mishandling on one overlap by
scorching home for two tries. The first came courtesy of Mark Little and Gordon
Laing, the second after a sizzling Fairley scrummage break and the appearance
of Thompson as extra centre. Other Kelso tries were by Gordon Laing, Australian
Cameron Meade, and Keith Thomson.
Tait's two tries owed much to the vision and explosiveness of Jim Thompson in
appearing like an animated prairie dog where Langholm didn't expect him, the
second time in a move involving close on a dozen passes.
The last scoring act was no more than Langholm deserved for never tossing in
the sponge - a tap offence kick and a cohesive forward charge in which Ian
Scott was driven over.
Langholm - M Grieve; W Braithwaite, R Elliot, B Middleton, A Beattie; C Turk, D
Johnstone; E Beattie, I Scott, C Grant, G Brannan, D McVittie, A Hotson, S
Graham, G Park. Replacement - J Smith for Graham (temporary 43-46 min, then
69min)
Kelso - K Utterson; S Ross, G Laing, B Mannion, J Thompson; S Tait, I Fairley;
J Ramage, K Thomson, N Stewart, S Rowley, S Laing, M Little, D Rankine, C
Meade. Replacement - G McCombie for Utterson (70 min).
Referee: M Richardson, (Gala Star).
SCORERS: Langholm - Turk, 2p; Scott, 1t. Kelso - Ross, 2t; Tait, 2t, 1 p, 4c;

MARK McGhee is shaping up as a manager of considerable expertise. His style and
progress as an apprentice leader of footballing men with Reading was monitored
closely by club chairmen on both sides of the Border and, quickly, it became
obvious the Scot was destined for greater things.
It was inevitable his developing prowess would be recognised by more
influential chairmen willing to pay larger fees. However, the manner in which
McGhee is rising through the ranks leaves a lot to be desired.
Indeed, the 38-year-old former Morton, Newcastle (where he had two spells),
Aberdeen, Hamburg, and Celtic striker blackened his image when he turned his
back on Leicester City last week.
McGhee left himself open to severe criticism when he left behind at Filbert
Street a group of confused players. One day they believed in him totally, the
next they were lost and confused, wondering why he could leave them so quickly.
They wondered also why he would go from a team challenging for promotion and
some of them could not hide their disgust. ``All the players are upset,'' said
the captain, Steve Walsh. ``Now we want to prove to Mark that what he did was
wrong. We feel what has happened is a disgrace.''
McGhee has decided he wants to manage Wolverhampton Wanderers, although that
particular club were saying little about the manager's decision to walk out on
Leicester after only a year. McGhee left Reading to take over from Brian Little
at Filbert Street after the latter decided to go to Aston Villa.
Leicester applied for a High Court injunction to prevent Little from leaving
and, after having thought McGhee was going to lead them into the Premiership,
they find themselves in a similar position. The club's chairman, Martin George,
struggled to subdue his anger, especially when the back-up team of assistant
manager Colin Lee and coach Mike Hickman also walked out. But no matter what
Leicester say or do McGhee and his people will not be returning.
It is simply a case of Leicester being unable to keep the Wolves from their
door, and even the offer of #200,000 a year could not disabuse McGhee of the
notion his career will be better served as manager of the Molineux club, even
though they are in a much lower position in the first division. In fact, while
Leicester are joint third top Wolves are only two points off bottom place in
the same division.
Walsh added that he hoped Wolves would now be relegated, and it is not
difficult to understand his contempt for the man in whom he and the rest of
Leicester's players had placed their belief. McGhee has hurt many people who
saw him as some kind of saviour and he will not be quickly forgiven.
Soon after time ran out on the former England manager, Graham Taylor, who
didn't cover himself in glory at Molineux, McGhee was mentioned as the most
likely successor and apparently he described Wolves as the last of the sleeping
giants. Within the Wolves boardroom that message was obviously translated as
``I'm your man.''
McGhee has made no secret of the fact that he has been guided in his managerial
career by one of his former managers, Alex Ferguson, who helped enormously to
get him started with Reading in 1991, but surely the Manchester United manager
could not have advised him to walk out on Leicester. Ferguson, who had great
faith and respect for the late Dick Donald when both were profoundly
influential at Aberdeen, knows the value of loyalty, a commodity which cannot
be bought.
Until the other day, when he drove away from Filbert Street, McGhee appeared to
be doing everything properly, but his departure clearly marks him as another of
the game's mercenaries.
Wolves may be able to smile for a while, but what will happen next time a
larger club looks towards McGhee? They must realise he might do to them what he
has just done to Leicester, whose directors tried for nine hours last Wednesday
to persuade McGhee to stay.
The chairman refused to accept letters of resignation and admitted to feeling
ashamed that he had offered McGhee more money than anyone deserves in a final
attempt to prevent defection. George added the reaction of he and his directors
was one of disbelief when McGhee refused the new terms, which would have made
him the highest paid manager in the first division and one of the highest in
the country.
However, there is little doubt Wolves will now make him the highest earner in
his league, but while we are all entitled to labour for the highest bidder
McGhee, I believe, had a moral obligation to fulfil. He owed Leicester, who
were willing to give him a platform, more than a year and, while they could not
hope to keep him forever if his success continued, they were entitled to expect
a little more gratitude.
McGhee has let himself down and his behaviour highlights again the hypocrisy
which exists within football, where directors, who often praise managers one
day and sack them the next, players and managers all talk about loyalty and
team spirit. Most of them have no conception of loyalty. Only fans know about
that and McGhee must hope that he never exhausts their faith in him.
Without friends and integrity a person does not have much in this world.
McGhee has hurt many people who saw him as some kind of saviour and he will not
be quickly forgiven

Musselburgh 39, Haddington 11
THE Regional Leagues were designed to provide meaningful competition for clubs
after the conclusion of the Premiership. This opening match of East Division 1,
however, bore all the hallmarks of a meaningless end-of-season encounter.
Indeed, one of the victorious Musselburgh side was later overheard describing
the game as ``just a friendly.''
Although both sides had flirted with relegation in their respective premiership
divisions, the gap between divisions three and four was obvious, albeit that
division four Haddington were desperately under-strength in a match switched to
Pinkie to beat the weather.
Their predominantly young pack battled valiantly to share the forward exchanges
but it was behind the scrum that the difference became glaring.
The Burgh backs looked dangerous throughout, taking the ball at pace, and took
just three minutes to open the scoring. Mark Steedman - impressive throughout
at stand-off - made the initial break and, after Graham Paxton and Cliff
Livingstone made further inroads, the ball was worked left for Graeme Jamieson,
on his wrong wing, to touch down in the corner.
Livingstone added a second score five minutes later, with Jamieson this time
the provider, and Musselburgh looked set to cut loose. All too often, however,
their final pass failed to match the quality of the build-up and chances were
scorned.
Haddington closed the gap with two Bryan Craig penalties while Dave Tait was
stopped just short of the line, but the visitors finally bowed to a spell of
concerted Musselburgh pressure. Full back Neil Lockhart grabbed two tries in
nine minutes, with Steedman and Jamieson prominent in the first. Lockhart
superbly converted his first from the right touchline but just failed to repeat
the feat from the same spot for his second score.
The second half was merely an exercise in damage limitation for out-gunned
Haddington with Craig attempting to keep Musselburgh at bay with some booming
clearances.
They couldn't prevent Jamieson scoring a second try after Livingstone burst
down the left wing, but did manage a consolation effort from Dave Cunningham.
The home forwards finally got on the score sheet when Ally Bonthron drove over
five minutes from time.
Musselburgh - N Lockhart; G Jamieson, C Livingstone, B Stewart, S Campbell; M
Steedman, A Elphinston; S Oliver, A Robertson, B Monks, G Paxton, J Hawkins, A
McLeod, A Bonthron, R Bain.
Haddington - S Brown; D Cunningham, G Cow, A Buglass, D Tait; B Craig, C
Murray; D Malcolm, R Mainstone, J Gibson, G Cuthill, R Evans, K Shearer, S
Burrell, S Fulton.
SCORERS: Musselburgh - Lockhart, 2t, 3c, 1p; Jamieson, 2t; Livingstone, 1t;

THE Scottish Football Association, who are not averse to a spot of arcane
legislation on how the game should be played, might learn something from the
National Collegiate Athletic Association which regulates the game of college
football in the USA.
This association has passed a decree forbidding praying on the football field.
Anyone caught praying is punished by a 15-yard penalty. A second praying
offence in a match leads to a sending-off.
My source for this info is Mary Jollimore, a lady sportswriter on the Toronto
Globe and Mail, who says the no-praying rule is part of a crackdown because the
college football authorities are ``fed up with players who pose for cameras,
engage in showboating, celebratory dances or actions that could be seen as
taunting an opponent.''
Such a ban would solve tricky little problems like a Celtic player crossing
himself after crossing a ball which leads to a goal against Rangers. Or the
antics of a well-known flute-playing Englishman at Ibrox.
Other celebratory manifestations we can live without include the elaborate bits
of formation dance that would not be out of place on Come Dancing and the habit
some goalscorers have of pulling their jerseys up over their heads. Duncan
Ferguson of Everton, is excused from the latter prohibition since he is never
certain when he might have to face his next identity parade.
But back to the American college football ban on thanking the Lord after
scoring a touchdown. Of course, the ruling was contested in court by Sam
Rutigliano, a coach at a devout Baptist university in Lynchburg, Virginia. The
college football authorities have since amended their rules.
``Players may pray or cross themselves without drawing attention to
themselves,'' said the chairman of the rules committee. They are also allowed
to kneel momentarily at the conclusion of a play if, in the judgment of the
official, the act is spontaneous and not a pose.
More problems for the poor old referee.
q.LAST week we offered to re-educate a Celtic fan as to the football skills of
a certain Rangers player by putting our review copy of the video John Greig,
the Legend up for raffle.
The winner is John A Gallagher of Fairlie, who didn't send documentary evidence
of being a follower of the Tims, but we'll take his word for it. Our thanks to
Douglas Kennet for telling us that John Greig, MBE, is an anagram for ``Me go
inj're - gbh''.
And to Mark Jack of Bathgate whose wife met John Greig at a golf function and
berated him for kicking her favourite player, wee Jimmy Johnstone, up and down
the park. John was unapologetic and said: ``That's nothing. I used to kick him
up and down the tunnel before we went on the park.''
I had a last wee look at the Legend video and was taken with John Greig's story
of how he would have done anything for Rangers and particularly for Willie
Waddell. Well, almost anything. One season, with the league title already in
the bag, Waddell came up with a good bit of hype to attract the fans to an
end-of-season game at Ibrox against Airdrie.
A huge balloon would descend on to the pitch and out would emerge a blonde
Hollywood-type starlet. That starlet would, in fact, be Greig who would then
take off the wig and strip off the dress to reveal his true identity. Greig
refused this role but eventually appeared as a true blue Roman Charlton Heston
on a chariot.
q.I FINALLY took the plunge and caught up with Hamilton Accies in this, their
annus horribilis. They lost at ``home'' at Firhill to Greenock Morton. The
Accies fans were chanting, predictably, that manager Iain Munro must go. The
Morton fans were chanting ``Munro must stay.''
Even more depressing than the Accies position at the bottom of the first
division, is the club's lack of a home with Douglas Park razed to the ground
for the building of a superstore. One Accies fan said he has had enough of
failure at Firhill: ``I'm going back to Douglas Park to support Sainsbury's.''

Glasgow District U-18 0,
North and Midlands U-18 15
THERE were no complaints from the Glasgow coaches after they watched their side
lose for the third time in the under-18 series. There was an acknowledgement
that the North and Midlands boys were better all round.
The visitors dominated the lineouts and at times they disrupted the Glasgow
eight in the set scrummages, but the clearest advantage came from their ability
to retain their own ball, and to pirate opposition ball at the breakdown.
Behind the scrum, the N and M half-backs Chris Black and Andy Gilbert were a
steady link to centres Graham Kiddie and Jamie Phillip.
A scrappy Glasgow heel, which was hacked through, let flanker Neil Smith snatch
the opening try, but both the other touchdowns were classy affairs. Jamie
Phillip's outside break saw full back Ross Chassels and Alan Davidson set up
Kiddie who barged over at the corner flag. Quick release from a scrum on the
home twenty-two let Black feed Chassels, who angled his run to cross at the
corner.
David Jones, given three difficult conversions, hit both post and bar but
failed to add any goal points.

Edinburgh U-18 6,
South U-18 13
COMMENTING after the match on the South's tactics of putting their Inter
District opponents under pressure, coach Ian Forsyth noted: ``The longer the
game went on, we knew Edinburgh would get rattled.''
How right he was. Edinburgh stand-off Jonny Sim was lucky to remain on the
field as several dissenting acts culminated in a penalty for South in front of
the posts five minutes from time.
Although Edinburgh had opened strongly, it was the Borderers who registered
first, conjuring the game's only try.
With his pack producing quickly-rucked ball, stand-off Keith Davidson missed
out his centres to find the charging Jim Ross, who released winger Colin Murray
for an excellent try, Davidson converting and then adding a penalty.
Sim slotted a penalty before the interval as Edinburgh livened up, then full
back Greg Kinross kicked a second as the capital side hauled back to within one
score.
However, Edinburgh's catch-up efforts proved fruitless in the dying minutes of
this penalty-strewn game, their parting gift to the South being eagerly
accepted by Davidson, who kicked the easy goal.

Regional League West
Glasgow Southern 31, GHK 24
ONCE you got used to the fact that many of the players weren't in the same
physical condition as the ones you watch of a usual weekend, once you got used
to the fact that they weren't as skilful either, and once you got used to the
fact that for the first half the crowd had forgotten what it was like to be in
a local derby, then it was good to settle down and watch the fur fly as a
Glasgow battle was back with us. But there could have been little fun in the
episode for GHK, who were severely limited in having to field less than half a
team on a slippery surface yet remained magnanimous in defeat.
The Southern boys loved it. Their fiery pack, a much stronger scrummaging unit
and more severe in its rucking, was everywhere in damaging numbers. Ben
Remnant, their bull of a New Zealand wing forward and a man who didn't mind
putting it about a bit, was frightening to watch and John Clinkenbeard can fair
get about in the loose. Stuart Simcox smokes too many fags to be the power he
once was, despite a solo try. Another Glasgow waste is Simcox.
GHK? Well, they probably didn't want to play and credit goes their way for
going ahead. ``I didn't know the names of some of the guys on the bench for
us,'' said backs' coach Mike Hunter.
GHK were 19-9 ahead at the break, having snatched the only try at that stage
when Tim Sanderson came on the crash. ``Our special is a rather tasty escargots
in garlic and parsley sauce . . .'' said the announcer at half-time.
Southern fought back, but were nearly let down by James Dunlop's kicking as he
missed four. Rian Anderson, Southern's hooker, was over after charges from
Remnant and Clinkenbeard. Graham Agnew pulled one back for GHK as a nifty
little dust up was taking place further down field, and then two Southern
tries, the first from Simcox as he plunged through a lineout gap and the second
from Jeff Kayne when he fell on the ball over the line at the feet of the pack,
took them ahead for the first time since the opening six points. A Dunlop drop
goal sealed the seven point winning margin. Sadly, Andy Ness injured his neck
but thankfully not severely. Southern have something worth protecting you know.
Glasgow Southern - M Menzies; M Guthrie, D Sharkey, A Healy, A Richardson; J
Dunlop, J Kayne; A McDougall, R Anderson, G Johnston, I Smith, A Tunn, J
Clinkenbeard, S Simcox, G Remnant.
GHK - G Hawkes; G Agnew, T Sanderson, H Bassi, G Caldwell; I MacArthur, A Kerr;
S Gay, M Blackie, A Johnston, K Wilson, C du Plessis, A Unkles, A Ness, R

q.FORMER England stand-off Rob Andrew is set to face Welsh star Jonathan Davies
in a classic fly-half duel.
Andrew's rugby millionaires Newcastle are planning to play Cardiff in a
money-spinning match at St James' Park in the New Year.
Davies, who recently returned to rugby union after a successful six-year spell
in league, is currently sidelined by a hernia operation but is expected back in
the New Year.
Backed by Newcastle supremo Sir John Hall, the fixture could be the forerunner
of top Anglo-Welsh matches in 1996.

Ulster 23, Edinburgh 24
EDINBURGH almost lost a game they should have wrapped up in Christmas paper
long before half-time.
Ulster, through the boot of outhalf Mark McCall, kept his side in the game and
almost snatched victory from Edinburgh's grasp. McCall, who had earlier kicked
six penalties, ghosted through a gap to score his side's only try in the final
minute. However, he watched his conversion veer widely in front of the posts as
Edinburgh, on their first visit to Belfast, chalked up a deserved but
fortuitous victory.
It was their skipper Ally Donaldson who was at the fulcrum as Edinburgh finally
shrugged off the Ulster challenge in the final 10 minutes.
Taking a ball along the left hand touchline, he kicked ahead but he was
adjudged by Irish referee Gordon Black to have been obstructed in the act of
touching down and a penalty try was awarded. Donaldson converted from in front
of the posts to give his side some breathing space with a 24-18 lead before
that nervous finale.
Earlier Edinburgh had struggled despite themselves to hold Ulster to a 9-9
scoreline at half-time. Donaldson had landed two of his three penalties while
full back Stuart Lang popped over a simple dropped goal.
The first try of the game came after 62 minutes when Darren Burns collected yet
another ball in the lineout five metres out and flanker Cameron Mather, who had
an excellent game, was in to support the jumper before crashing over for an
unconverted try.
Ulster - C Wilkinson; S Willis, W Harbinson, M Field, A Park; M McCall, A
Matchett; R Mackey, S Ritchie, D Scott, G Longwell, M Rea, S McKinty, D
Erskine, K McKee.
Edinburgh - S Lang; D MacRae, S Hastings, D Wylie, F Henderson; A Donaldson, G
Burns; R McNulty, G McKelvie, G Wilson, D Burns, M McVie, C Mather, B Ward, D
Clark.
Referee - G Black (Leinster).
SCORERS: Ulster - McCall, 6p, 1t. Edinburgh - penalty try; Mather, 1t;
Donaldson, 3p, 1c; Lang, 1dg.

BOXING
GERMAN boxing fans rioted in Stuttgart on Saturday night after South Africa's
Francois Botha outpointed local hero Axel Schulz for the vacant International
Boxing Federation's world heavyweight title.
Chanting ``fix, fix, fix,'' fans threw coins, champagne glasses and bottles at
the ring, slightly injuring six people, when the decision went against Schulz,
whose manager described the verdict as a ``con.''
The police, who detained three people, found it almost impossible to identify
the culprits in the melee as both boxers, their corner men, and thousands of
fans fled the Schleyer-Halle arena.
At first, officials had announced a 2-1 split decision by the three judges,
before later stating that American referee Al De Vito had in fact scored the
fight 118-111 for Botha, not 115-113 for Schulz. Judge Harry Davis of Canada
ruled the fight 116-112 for Botha, while Eugene Grant of the USA saw the South
African winning 115-113.
``It was a con,'' said Schulz's manager, Wilfried Sauerland. ``There's no such
thing as an 118-111 score for Botha. He only gave Schulz two rounds.''
The bout was for the IBF crown given up by George Foreman, whose last fight was
a controversial win over Schulz last April in Las Vegas.
Botha, who now lives in California, entered the fight with a 35-0 record and 21
knock-outs, but neither fighter was in danger of hitting the canvas. Botha
often stood in the middle of the ring, his hands lowered, daring the
light-hitting Schulz to hurt him.
Schulz, with only 10 knock-outs in his 21-3-1 record, tagged Botha with several
stiff rights, but barely jarred his opponent, who proved an easy target.
Botha's next fight may be against Mike Tyson, but this victory is unlikely to
silence critics of his ability.
Botha started aggressively, taking the fight to Schulz. The former East German
tried to pick up the pace from the seventh round, but the bulkier Botha matched
the German in terms of fitness.
He is only the second South African to hold a heavyweight title, following
Gerrie Coetzee, who won the World Boxing Association title in 1983. But it was
the violent reaction of many of the capacity 13,000 crowd which overshadowed
the occasion.
Germany's IBF world light-heavyweight champion Henry Maske and former IBF
super-middleweight champion Graciano Rocchigiani both agreed with the judges'
verdict. Sauerland added: ``The biggest defeat for German boxing is not that of
Axel Schulz but the reaction of the audience.''
Germany last staged a heavyweight title bout in 1976, when Muhammad Ali beat
England's Richard Dunn in Munich.
Earlier, Frank Liles of New York retained his WBA super-middleweight title with
a unanimious point decision over Brazil's Mauricio Amaral, and Detroit's Tom
Johnson was knocked down three times but won a narrow decision over Jose
Badillo of Puerto Rico to retain his IBF featherweight title.

THE formal signing of the Bosnian peace agreement in Paris on Thursday may not
take place, even though the agreement was formulated and its drafts initialled
at Dayton, Ohio, last month. If there is a last-minute hitch it will be the
outcome of a French decision to link the agreement with the fate of two French
airmen, missing since their Mirage jet was downed by a Bosnian Serb missile
over Pale at the end of August. The French government is convinced that the two
men are alive but no-one can be sure since there have been no confirmed
sightings since August 30. The French are themselves convinced that the men are
alive and have been trying to exert extreme diplomatic pressure to ensure their
release. Unfortunately the Serbs and the Bosnian Serbs alike insist that they
know nothing of the airmen's fate, though they were filmed by Bosnian TV, safe
and sound, having successfully baled out of their stricken plane. No objective
evidence has been found to contradict the Serb claim that they have since
disappeared into the bleak landscape of Bosnia. It does seem improbable
however, and the ugly worry is that, although they were captured as they were
filmed, they could have later been killed. Just possibly they have escaped and
are at large, but it is a supposition which becomes harder to sustain as time
passes. It is difficult to see, assuming that they are held alive, what
advantage the Bosnian Serbs would gain from retaining them. It may be easier to
understand a shamed silence if the men have been murdered but, even there, it
would be better for the truth to be established sooner rather than later.
It is all too easy to see what damage could follow the French response to
continued uncertainty - the French government has imposed an ultimatum, due to
have expired this morning, which could compromise the whole peace agreement
unless the men turn up unharmed. Apart from any other consideration, the
question asks itself: ``What if the men are now genuinely missing (dead or
alive)? The French government is threatening not to formalise the agreement
unless they appear. It could be a tall order, carrying with it the possibility
that the whole laboriously constructed accord could simply unravel, though the
French government insists that its commitment to send 10,000 troops to Bosnia
is unaffected. The troops, including the other contingents, could all be
deployed but the circumstances in which they are to operate will change
dramatically if this impasse is not resolved. The French seem unwilling even to
think about backing down: with France in domestic upheaval and the Juppe
government looking weak, it will hardly want to underline that weakness by
eating its words in Yugoslavia if the deadline (fortunately not precisely
fixed) is allowed to pass.
The suspicion that such domestic calculation underlies the French position
cannot be dismissed. Governments are often tempted to try to distract domestic
opinion from the home front by focussing attention abroad where matters are at
once usually more complex but less vital to the public. It seems an entirely
unnecessary risk but the French have been unhappy about how the present Bosnian
peace plan has been cobbled together, mainly by American diplomacy which has,
to a considerable extent, excluded them. The intemperate ultimatum could be
explained by injured French amour propre. It seems an unworthy thought but the
balance of interests - peace versus the return of two nationals is
disproportionate. No-one would want a government to abandon its soldiers to
their fate at Bosnian Serb hands in this particularly nasty war, but what is
unfolding here is an enormous gamble.

I AM in love. It's been coming on for some time now and is growing with each
passing day. I have kept it to myself too long. It's time I went public.
Mind you, I quail at the vituperation I may be inviting in The Herald letters
page. Having inspired dizzying heights of invective merely by mentioning our au
pair, the confession of consuming passion for an Aga will no doubt put the tin
lid on it.
I know, I know. The Aga-saga - so terribly middle-class, I'm terrified to go
and buy a Joanna Trollope in case I recognise myself. It's also, this love
affair of mine, so depressingly predictable. I mean, why can't I have the
originality of mind to be able to announce that I've got an Aga and I hate the
thing, instead of drooling on like everybody else who's ever owned one?
The lady who sold us this house started it. She said there were two things she
would be specially sorry to leave. One was the garden, on which she had clearly
lavished more attention in a week than we were likely to in a year. The other,
she said wistfully, was her beloved Aga.
How on earth, I wondered, could someone be in love with a cooker - even with
such an admittedly handsome one as her big, shiny, red one that would,
according to the instructions, ``bake, boil, braise, grill, roast, stew, steam,
simmer, toast and fry, all with the minimum of attention''? I'd as soon have
worshipped the vacuum cleaner and, frankly, if I were going to scatter silly
epithets around the kitchen, I'd have plumped for the washing machine, although
``my precious Hotpoint'' doesn't have quite the same ring.
Cookery, you understand, has never really been my thing. I can just about get
some nutrition into the children without giving them salmonella, but it's
pretty basic stuff, and my husband long ago recognised that if he were actually
to enjoy a meal, he'd be better off doing it himself. Or indeed getting others
to do it. We both rather guiltily cherish a certificate presented years ago by
a friend who knows us too well, which celebrates in beautiful italic script the
first meal ``at which the guests were not required to prepare their own food''.
I blame it on my genes. I'm reliably informed that when my mother made my first
birthday cake, she had the novel idea of putting the icing on before placing it
in the oven. At least I've never done that . . . I buy the birthday cakes in
Tesco.
My offspring put up with my culinary limitations pretty manfully on the whole,
although my seven-year-old did once offer a glimpse of their true feelings when
he announced, in the tones of kindly contempt that children reserve for the
grossest parental shortcomings: ``You're always late, you're scared of spiders
and . . . you can't make chocolate mousse.'' After pointing out mildly that one
three-minute wait outside school in the last month hardly constituted
``always'', I further suggested to him that the presence of eggshell in my
mousse made it more interesting than other mothers' boring old mousses. He was
unconvinced.
Now, I'm not saying that Aga has reformed me. Eggshell is eggshell, after all.
But the whole cooking business has definitely become more of a pleasure. All
that stored heat waiting for you all the time, with never a knob to turn or a
button to press, is so inviting. The Aga simply wills you to pop things into
it, or on to it, or over it. It's fast. It's easy. It's the lazy cook's delight.
Lest this start to sound as if I'm on commission, let me assure you that it's
very difficult to get things exactly right. But since I never get things
exactly right anyway, this is just my cup of tea. And as time goes on, even I
am catching on to how long the joint takes and how many minutes will produce
perfect toasted cheese without incinerating the bread.
It was not ever thus. When I was still learning how long it takes to roast a
chicken, we had a little boy round for tea. While my children were tucking
gamely into shrivelled potatoes and ancient hen, he quietly put his knife and
fork down. ``Not hungry, Callum?'' I inquired brightly. ``I'm afraid,'' he said
with mortifying politeness, ``it doesn't taste like the chicken I'm used to.''
I gave him a peanut butter sandwich.
These days, the simple expedient of taking the poor bird out an hour or two
earlier has improved things no end. Taste my chicken and live, say I. Mind you,
there's still a certain air of apprehension in the house as regards the
Christmas turkey, but since it is now not possible to repeat the disaster of
two years ago when I forgot to switch the oven on, I have high hopes of success.
Of course the Aga is great for other things to. You can dry eight wellingtons
and at least two pairs of trousers on it, plus a couple of anoraks over the
rail in front. A whole pulley-load of wet clothes above it will be ready to
wear by the morning. You can soften the ice-cream on top and defrost a loaf
inside. When you stumble into the kitchen in the middle of a cold night to
collect a dummy, or a drink, or a sick-basin, you're engulfed in the most
blissful warmth.
But that's all a bonus. Best of all, this shiny hunk of mine doesn't sneer at
my pathetic efforts to cook. It makes me feel better than I am, cleverer than I
am, warm and special. If I were ever to put a cake in one of its capacious
ovens with the icing already on, it would doubtless inform me.
This is real love.

IN THE final furlong of the twentieth century, when the daughters of the sexual
revolution turned into working mothers, the magazine to target them most
directly was She, with perpetual advice on how to juggle.
Now that Linda Kelsey, the editor, has flung the entire set of Indian clubs to
the winds and resigned due to stress-induced illness, the post-feminist world
is all a-flutter at the dramatic rejection of her own diktat by the high
priestess of the have-it-all tribe.
At 43, she has claimed time for a better-balanced life, but the decision has
not been universally applauded. Penny Hughes, UK director of Coca Cola, was
more overtly criticised last year when she gave up a #250,000 salary for the
unpaid, 24-hour day of early motherhood. Trading a seat on the board for a baby
buggy was tantamount to treason.
Anyone who has ever tried at the humblest of levels to be both caring, capable
mum and equally competent professional knows what common sense tells us all:
that you can be in only one place and concentrate on only one task at a time.
It is a self-defeating myth that we can cherry-pick our way through life,
taking on the most exciting jobs without the hard slog that goes into any
serious career. If you put in the hard slog you are not going to be there every
night to oversee the homework and the teatable. Thousands of women have devised
their own route through that maze but many thousands more find themselves
hedged in by the incompatibility of working and nursery and school days and
years.
Yet Government policy-makers still take a wholly outdated (and male) view of
the world in which babies and young children are cared for at home, if not by
their mothers then by a mother-substitute. In statistical terms, they are
largely right, because most childcare in this country is a mix of mum, dad,
granny, childminder, playgroup and nursery school cobbled together in a way
which suits each family's circumstances.
When the children's lobby - combining everyone from the charities to the
Scottish Childminding Association and the Scottish Pre-school Play Association
- says we need a national strategy, we should listen, because they take the
clear-sighted child's eye view. The latest survey of the labour force in
Scotland showed 51% of women with a child aged 0-9 were in full or part-time
work. It is no longer safe to assume that these are mothers of school-age
children finishing work by 3pm, because the 51% included 44% of women with a
child under three. The official response to the need for good quality
pre-school care is the nursery vouchers scheme intended to provide a place at
nursery school for every four-year-old. In the view of those most directly
involved, it fails to appreciate reality.
At a conference in Glasgow at which the European Childcare Network, which
advises the European Commission on policy, unveiled its 10-year action
programme of targets for quality in services for young children, it became
clear how far Britain is out of step with the rest of Europe. According to
Peter Moss, co-ordinator of the network, we need a new policy framework,
ideally following from a new, Early Childhood Act  ``The UK is exceptional in
Europe in its insistence on part-time nursery education. Most of Europe offers
full-time education for three to six-year-olds,'' says Moss, who believes we
need to extend the pre-school years from five to six. European research has led
them to the conclusion that 1% of gross domestic product should be spent on
children from birth to six. In UK terms that would be #6.5bn compared with the
current estimate of between #2bn and #2.5bn.
That does not mean publicly-funded nurseries for all. Moss argues that a common
funding policy and a common staffing approach can lead to a seamless mixed
economy of provision and cites New Zealand and Denmark as examples of countries
where local authorities and private organisations work to the same standards,
with parents sometimes paying a top-up fee for longer hours.
He believes that one government department should be responsible for policy for
nought to six-year-olds. In Spain, a new proposal defining education services
as covering children from 0-18 resulted in the 0-6s being integrated into the
schools system, although often in separate centres. It also meant that the
basic qualification for everyone working with children aged three and over is
now a teaching one.
The network has set a target that a minimum of 60% of staff working directly
with children should have at least three years of post-18 level training and
that unqualified staff should have right of access to in-service training.
``Early years children's services in the UK have suffered from long-term
neglect, short-sighted decision-making and low standards and a national
framework of quality targets has an essential role to play,'' says Moss. The
network suggests a target of public funding for full-time equivalent places for
90% of children aged three to six and at least 15% of children under three with
flexibility to cover both the working day and the working year.
The fear from all sectors at the conference was that vouchers will merely add a
bureaucratic tier to what is already there, diverting funds which could be used
for direct provision, especially in poor or rural areas which cannot support
private provision. Expected costs in England, for example, suggest that the
#4.95m pilot phase will cost #5m to administer.
According to Bronwen Cohen, director of Children in Scotland: ``There is
enormous disappointment felt by many agencies in Scotland that the Government
is focusing so narrowly on four-year-olds and we are not meeting EU policy in
this area. Many parents might opt for support which would allow them to take
more leave from work. The UK is now the only country in Europe which has not
implemented the parental leave directive.''
The detailed workings of the voucher system in Scotland have still to be
settled - and, as one of the subjects due to be considered by the Grand
Committee, there is scope for a distinctive Scottish version. There is still
debate, for instance about whether childminders should be eligible to redeem
vouchers.
Although that has been ruled out in England, it is possible that the great
dependence on child minders in rural Scotland where there is often no
alternative will lead to their inclusion.
With proper quality assurance and inspection and with the development of
childminding networks, Celia Carson, national early years development officer
for Children in Scotland, believes that childminders with appropriate training
could be included. She says: ``Children in Scotland believes that all types of
early years provision should have common standards and that care and education
can happen in all types of setting.''
It is not just executive mums who know that children need to learn from parents
and others; at home and outside it.

WITH one eye on the long-term trend indicated by opinion polls, one may presume
that the Labour Party stand likely to win the next General Election. This,
therefore, implies that their devolution proposals, so risible, and unworthy of
discussion on their own merits, need be addressed.
To me, as a committed unionist who believes in the ``status quo'' - am I the
only one left, now even Mr Forsyth has jumped ship? - it is a great relief to
learn that in the event of a Labour Government a Scottish assembly would be so
toothless.
I wrote to your newspaper recently (Unbelievable tax-raising powers, October
23), commenting, admittedly with my tongue in my cheek, on the implications of
Canon Kenyon Wright's assertions that any proposed tax rises by a new assembly
would be, in detail and at all times, cleared in advance with the electorate.
The Canon's proposals certainly were ``unbelievable'', although if it is
possible for something to be more unbelievable, then it is surely the decision
of Mr Blair to repeat this assertion.
In 16 years of ongoing criticism of successive Conservative administrations,
the ``Scottish Establishment'' (this includes your newspaper) have hardly
produced an analysis of any contemporary political question which has not been
underpinned with the implication that only by addressing fundamental
``underfunding'' can satisfactory remedies be found.
This given, it is certain that my derision felt at the vacuity of the Labour
Party's proposals is only matched by the dismay felt by the ``Scottish
Establishment'' (I refer your editorial of December 8) on hearing that, when
the dream is about to be realised, the total monies available will exactly
equal the amount which would accrue to Scotland in any event under existing
funding formulae, less the costs of running the new assembly.
The next General Election is nearing, so don't delay. Start thinking now how to
explain to the Scottish people why expenditure cuts are a small price to pay
for the privilege of having our own parliament.
Grant McPherson,
1 Greenfield Court, Balfron.
I AM surprised that The Herald is in favour of the proposed Scottish parliament
and consequently of a Labour Government at Westminster.
You even appear to have instructed Alf Young, a normally sensible fellow, to
write a rather desperate article trying to minimise the disadvantages of such a
situation (December 5).
It has always seemed to me that the apparent desire for ``home rule'' arises
from the simple fact that most MPs who sit for this part of the UK called
Scotland are socialists whereas the UK Parliament is Tory and thus we have Tory
policies throughout the country.
We won't have this costly assembly unless there is a UK Labour Government and
if and when that happens, the Secretary of State and his Ministers will all be
socialists and they will pursue Socialist policies, so the need for the extra
layer of government will disappear.

IT came from Johannesburg - and the quicker it gets back there the better. For
this epidemic of flu has laid low the nation and reminded us once again of how
helpless we seem to be in the face of viral infection.
Doctors dish out antibiotics for other germs which attack us but all they can
do with that virus which brings flu is to recommend aspirins, hot drinks, a
warm bed - and patience.
Not that the doctor actually tells you that in person. The information comes
usually from medical correspondents who tell you there is not much point in
calling your doctor. In the first place, he/she will be too busy. And in any
case there is nothing much to be done, except follow the standard advice.
So you lay your head on that pillow, sleep as much as you can and doctor
yourself to the best of your ability. For the first day or two, nothing really
matters.
I had been astounded to hear from a lady who supports Aberdeen Football Club
with feminine vigour that she missed the recent Cup Final because of her flu
but felt so miserably ill that she didn't even bother to ask the score.
Some days later, by now in a similar condition, I was astonished to find the
ease with which I was prepared to turn down an invitation to an American
Presidential bash at the Walford Astoria in New York.
But the worst passes by and you lie there on your back, gazing at a ceiling you
haven't noticed for years, with more time to think than you've had in a long
time.  The first stray thought to enter my head was this: if half the nation is
suffering from flu - and the advice is to stay away from your doctor - then
that half of the nation is not well enough to be contracting all the other
ailments which come to afflict us.
So . . . with the surgeries now spared that horde of influenzians, it should
follow that doctors are less busy than usual. Or did my vision of medics
twiddling their thumbs come simply from a mixture of mischief and boredom?
Doctors are complaining about an increase in house-calls, a claim for which I
find no evidence among my circle of acquaintances. For all my visits to the
surgery, I can't recall an occasion in the past 25 years when I have been seen
by the doctor at home.
The routine nowadays seems to be that you wait until you are well enough to
visit the surgery, by which time you are presumably past the crisis point.
Meanwhile, the neighbouring samaritan who normally sees that I am fed and
watered has been laid low with the rest of us, leaving me to drum up my own
vitamins, from orange juice to a plate of scrambled eggs.
For her supply of antibiotics (meant to counteract anything which might arise
from the flu) the lady in question was obliged to visit her doctor when she
felt fit enough to do so.
That cannot have done her much good because she has been back in bed ever
since. There is surely something far wrong with a system like this.
In my own case, I must confess to a couple of indiscretions from which I felt I
had no escape. As the flu tightened its grip, I rose from a sick bed, decked
myself out in white tie and tails - and was taken by limousine to the Trades
Hall of Glasgow to fulfil a long-standing speaking engagement for the Tailors
of Rutherglen.
Proof of my presence that night must come from others. All I remember is the
reassurance that the president, on my right, was Dr David Willox, and the other
main speaker, on my left, was the distinguished surgeon, Archie Hutchison. At
least I was in good hands.
But if that was foolhardy, I hadn't learned the lesson. A capacity audience had
bought tickets for the Royal Concert Hall to see my film of the great Queen
Mary and to hear the rather hair-raising story of how I came to make it.
At least I now felt well enough to cope with the concert hall's regular
lunchtime audience which is among the most intelligent and sympathetic you will
ever come across.
So I rose in time for a late breakfast, washed and dressed and settled down to
the plate of muesli which is supposed to be so good for your fibre diet. I
don't know what it does for your diet but now I know what it does for your
teeth in my advancing years.
I crunched into one of their health-giving nuts - and crack! Out came my big
front tooth, right up to the gum. It's the second tooth this year I have lost
to their blasted nuts; only, on this occasion, there was no time for repair.
The car was waiting to transport me to the concert hall. And there I was,
parading before a large audience and whistling into the gap of a splendid tooth
which had served me well for 55 years.
I wouldn't have believed the handicap of a missing front tooth.
I simply made a joke of my indistinguishable ``f''s and ``s''s - and promised
myself an immediate return to porridge. They can stick their muesli where the
monkey sticks its nuts.

HAVING chosen the subject of drink and driving for your editorial, I assume
that you have seen evidence showing that a reduction to 50mg would result in a
reduction in accidents and not simply an increase in prosecution of motorists
(December 4).
I feel that most of those who press for a lower and lower limit have no
evidence whatsoever to support their case and are simply out to treat the
motorist as a whipping boy regardless of the facts of the case.
Such irrational pursuit of an innocent victim is no different in principle from
the school bully, the anti-semite, or the religious bigot.
The Government response to the campaign for 50mg is that 2!s% of accidents
involve motorists within the 50mg to 80mg band. If at any given time 2!s% of
all motorists have a level of 50 to 80mg it could be concluded that this band
is no more accident-prone than drink-free drivers.
It is not beyond comprehension that motorists in this band could be less
accident-prone than sober motorists. If this were found to be true would you
conduct a campaign against sober motorists?
In essence what I am saying is that if you have written the editorial without
knowledge of the facts you might at best be lending support to bigots and at
worst supporting a line of action which could result in an increase in
accidents.
Why not have a Herald investigator look into the subject, examine the evidence
seriously and impartially, and in due course inform your readers of the outcome?
A high proportion of reasonable citizens are keen to do the right thing and
some reliable information would be of great benefit.

IN his report about the Commission's hormones conference your correspondent
confesses to a certain degree of confusion over the EU's approach to the use of
growth promoters in meat (December 5).
It is true that the conference found no evidence of human health risks arising
from their use. However, that is not, nor has it ever been, the central point.
The prevailing EU view is founded on two related suppositions. The first is
that because these drugs are not used for the treatment of sick animals they
should be subject to more than the customary tests for animal pharmaceuticals;
those of safety, quality, and efficacy.
We in the Parliament have always argued that they should also be subject to a
fourth test which should take the form of a socio-environmental impact
assessment.
The second point arising from this is the fundamental importance of maintaining
public confidence in the meat sector. The meat industry is of vital importance
and we cannot afford to have consumer uncertainty over the quality of EU meat.
Commissioner Fischler and I have discussed this at some length and we are both
of the opinion that the most effective way of ensuring that there is public
confidence in the meat sector is to maintain the ban on the use of growth
promoters.

SISTER Gemma teaches in Dumbarton. A few hours before entering the STV studios
to record a Scottish Women discussion on nuns she asked her French class to say
a wee prayer for her.
``Oh, miss, you don't need prayers,'' they chorused.
``At least I won't need rouge, I've been blushing all day,'' she said, as some
50 nuns were shepherded into the studio, dressed for the most part in smart box
pleat skirts, with shirts and cardigans in cheerful shades of blue, pink and
green. Only a handful wore the habit; nearly all had simple silver or wooden
crosses round their necks.
Cold calling religious orders, said STV researcher Heather Curley, whose
endless phone calls helped set up tonight's programme, is not the easiest job
in the world. But the fact that a sizeable proportion of Britain's religious
congregations sent representatives to the show is a measure of the place they
want to take in it.
``You're not the only ones with voices in your ears,'' said presenter Kaye
Adams, listening to the instructions from the recording gallery as she chatted
to the audience. ``I'm really terrifed of offending you here,'' she added as
they laughed in response.
She need not have worried; Sister Teresa, 33 years in the Carmelite enclosed
order in Dumbarton, said: ``You actually need a sense of humour to survive, and
I think it comes from community jokes.''
This may not be the usual Scottish Women audience, but it is a determined and
articulate one; nuns are utterly fed up with their outdated image.
The Second Vatican Council, 1962-65, redefined the notion of being ``called''
to faith, allowing the call to be a universal experience, and not one
exclusively gifted to people enclosed in convents or wearing priestly robes.
Religious women abandoned the convents and started living in the community,
took off the habit and even reverted to their baptismal names; a typical nun in
Scotland today may live in a shared house or on her own, can train for whatever
work she feels will help her congregation's mission, and may drop the title
``Sister''.
The vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, which maintain the fabric of the
religious life when the outward trappings have been cast off, further free
women to pursue the path of service.
There was a hum of disapproval from the women when Adams suggested their life
was restrictive.
Barrister Catherine Shelley, political lobbyist and member of the Institute of
the Blessed Virgin Mary, said poverty was ``about availability. By not having
family commitments, I am freer to go out and get involved in the mission.'.
For Isabel Smyth of the Sisters of Notre Dame, poverty is ``the sharing of
resources''. A teacher for 20 years, she has never received her salary
personally; it has gone straight to her community.
Celibacy ``is about making a promise not to enter into a partnership with one
other person; it doesn't exclude forming healthy relationships wth other
people''.
Obedience attracts less comment, but that may be because of the freedom the
Sisters now have in determining their lives, and the fact that orders were
often founded with a wide-ranging and clear vision that has given women great
scope. The Sisters of Notre Dame, for example, founded teacher training schools
in the wake of the French Revolution to help a destabilised country move into
the modern age.
Scotland has some 900 religious women, whose congregations are affiliated to
one of the four great orders, Franciscan, Carmelite, Augustinian and Dominican.
Numbers are declining, but more important may be the fact that new entrants
nowadays are not young girls, but women, maybe in their late 20s and early 30s,
who have decided that religious life offers something more.
The traditional schools and hospitals of the old order have given way to
community counselling and therapy, and although the notion of a career is alien
- the work you choose to do is in the service of others - women in the audience
have trained as psychologists and counsellors to further their work with
children, or become industrial chaplains, or any number of posts; one Sister of
Notre Dame is a chaplain in Barlinnie Prison.
Mary Jo McCallum is on the board of directors of the Sisters of Notre Dame,
which administers contracts from Strathclyde Regional Council and local health
boards in the field of family training and welfare; the order runs drugs and
abuse awareness programmes and counselling.
``The work is fulfilling in the sense that you know you are touching the
deepest needs in society, that's a very important admission of why women become
religious. Yes, it's about giving your life to God, yes, it's about making
vows, but it's a basic response to human needs.''
Sisters will admit to maternal instincts, to missing out on having a family.
But the married life brings its own commitments and its own sacrifices.
``Marriage sounds like a prison sentence to me!'' one nun said, laughing to her
group as they relaxed, glasses of red wine in hand, in the hospitality suite
after the recording.
``The problem is where do we go now in the future?'' said Isabel Smyth. ``When
we looked different and apparently seemed to be different people would say
there's a reason for the choice. Now they say things like `What makes you
different?' Many of us are actually doing jobs that other people do. What makes
us different is not our externals but our intentions in the context of the vows
and the commitment to the religious community.''
None of which stops them having fun; Scottish Women was recording on the night
Princess Diana, another woman apparently seeking to devote her life to the
service of others, made her revelations to the nation. ``What time is Panorama
on?'' asked a nun as was leaving. ``And there's Cracker as well, and the X
Files; it's going to be a good night.''

I HOPE that many readers will have noticed the remarkable unanimity expressed
in recent weeks by voluntary organisations, churches, and public bodies. There
is very considerable distress and anger about the proposals to deprive
asylum-seekers of social security benefit, proposals on which our members of
Parliament may have an opportunity to vote on December 19.
Some of the anger and distress is about justice: to treat all asylum-seekers as
if they are all illegally here cannot be right. Some of it is about fear: it is
not difficult to predict that the results of these proposals will be very bad
for race relations. Some of it is about compassion: compassion for children and
for old people and for those who are in fear of their lives.
One constant theme of the Bible is the special responsibility God's people have
for refugees. Christmas is the wrong time to forget that.

WOULD anyone, north or south of the Border, disagree with the proposition that
Scotland possesses every conceivable qualification to be an independent nation,
should it so choose?
We have a geographical, social, and cultural identity, we have identifiable
legal, educational, and religious systems and we are blessed with abundant
natural resources: oil, gas, coal, electric power, timber, fish, and
wilderness. We have a (mainly) well-educated and skilled workforce,
well-developed financial markets, and much more besides.
In fact, when the cards were dealt, it seems that we were given a ``straight
flush''.
Surely, then, the only question is whether we have the will to reassert control
of our own destiny. My vision is of a prosperous, confident and entrepreneurial
nation dependent not on block grants from Westminster or subsidies from
Brussels, but on our own native wits. In marketing terms, Scotland could be one
of the strongest brand names in the world.
Independence, not within Europe for that is surely a contradiction in terms,
but true independence is not for those who simply believe that we will float
free on a sea of oil and certainly not for those whose sense of Scottishness is
based primarily on being anti-English.
We need men and women of stature to lead this debate, with a breadth of vision
which transcends the narrow political divides, to put the case for and against
to the people of Scotland, then to be decided in a binding referendum.
Is mine a lonely vision, or widely shared?

Windsurfing on Tiree
WHILE not wishing to become involved in the ``windsurfers versus crofters''
issue, I feel I must contradict Alasdair Matheson's statement that windsurfers
are putting a considerable sum of money into the economy of Tiree, and that we
are now prosperous due to them (December 5). This is a hyperbolic statement of
fantasy.
Windsurfers appear to come into two categories: young people with very little
money (all of which is spent on their windsurfing equipment) and the more
mature professional person with a good deal of spare cash (enough to buy up
property on the island).
Unfortunately for the economy of Tiree the former greatly outnumber the latter.
They come with their vans loaded with surf-boards and food, cram into
self-catering accommodation, and spend the absolute minimum in the local shops.
The second category do spend, and for that we must be grateful.
The improved prosperity which Mr Matheson sees is not due in any way to his
fraternity, but to the hard work and efforts of the local crofters and those
involved in the tourist industry.
We on Tiree most certainly welcome tourists, including windsurfers, but please

IF it is important that we retain a sea-going nuclear deterrent force the least
that could be expected is a measure of common sense in managing it. That rather
basic requirement is entirely lacking in the Government's lamentable handling
of the issue of refitting the Trident submarine force. In a few years time
around the year 2000 the first of these submarines, HMS Vanguard, will come
home looking for a dockyard capable of handling her refuelling and refitting.
Vanguard and her bewildered crew will find, not one dockyard, but two assigned
to the various necessary tasks. The tricky role of refuelling will now, we
believe, be carried out at Rosyth after which she will be sailed south for the
other bits and pieces to be completed at Devonport. There is, of course, no
need for this fragmented approach. The simple fact is that, lured by the dogma
of market forces, the Government embarked on a wrong-headed competition between
Rosyth and Devonport for the work, then denied the contract to Rosyth who could
handle it and awarded it instead to Devonport who could not.
If this seems idiotic the reasons behind it are less appealing than ordinary
simple-mindedness. The political ideology of the Tory Party ordained that
competitive tendering between Rosyth and Devonport would bring out the best
deal for the taxpayer; market forces would see to that. The problem with this
is that a cursory glance at the Royal Navy shows that it is too small to allow
for successful competition for its business between even two companies. The
necessary work needs to be directed by the Ministry of Defence to the place
best-suited to carry it out and in the opinion of most objective sources that
place is Rosyth. Matters become seriously murky at this point for Devonport is
in an area where the Tory Party needs to find votes before the next General
Election. In these circumstances it is deemed unwise to abandon Devonport for
Rosyth, and although that decision was made at the beginning of the year
because of the political embarrassment it would cause it is likely to be
confirmed within days so that the queasy compromise which we have already
described may be established.
It will please nobody. Devonport, which put in a lower bid than Rosyth only to
see the costs of acquiring the necessary facilities spiral out of control, will
be unhappy that such a dominant part of the necessary work will be carried out
in Scotland. Rosyth, which is much better placed to do the entire refuelling
and refitting task, will be angry, and rightly so, that the yard will be denied
the full contract. The views of the Royal Navy officers who have to cope with
the consequences of this mismanagement are probably unprintable. The Minister
of Defence, Mr Michael Portillo, will undoubtedly be relieved, especially if he
can slide the announcement of the compromise into the public domain when nobody
is looking, that is, around the Christmas recess. To that end, any announcement
will most likely be left to a Junior Defence Minister. Yet Mr Portillo must
still wrestle with the problem of how or if the two yards can be privatised.
Remarkably little interest has been shown in them with Babcock, which operates
the Scottish yard, being the only contender for Rosyth and DML in a similar
position at Devonport. Unfortunately there was the deepest unhappiness within
the Ministry of Defence over the prospect of DML handling the modernisation of
the Devonport dockyard for the full Trident programme. Whether these objections
will persist remains to be seen but this episode is, and will remain, a truly
sorry affair.

STRATHCLYDE Police are investigating two suspected drugs deaths in separate
incidents at the weekend which, if confirmed, will take the number of
drug-related deaths in the region to 99 this year.
A 16-year-old boy, Barry McCluskie, of Rossbank Road, Port Glasgow, was found
dead in a house in Greenock early on Saturday. Ambulance services attended the
house, in Lyle Street, but efforts to revive him failed.
Police said there appeared to be no suspicious circumstances.
It is believed that Barry might may have died as a result of the combined
effect of consuming alcohol and a sedative pill. One source indicated that it
was not thought he had consumed an ecstasy tablet, as had been reported in a
newspaper yesterday.
A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out today and a report is to be
submitted to the procurator-fiscal.
Police are also investigating the death of Anthony Tamburrini, 37, whose body
was found in a house in Hugo Street, Ruchill, Glasgow, on Saturday afternoon.
Police said there appeared to be no suspicious circumstances and that a report
would be submitted to the procurator-fiscal. Detectives believe the death might
also have been drugs-related.
Mr Tamburrini was cleared in September 1991 of murdering the three-year-old son
of his girlfriend when the jury returned a not-proven verdict.
There was a total of 97 drug-related deaths in Strathclyde region last year.
q Police are appealing for information after the theft of dangerous drugs from
a Vauxhall vehicle which was stolen in Southview Avenue, Busby, early yesterday.
The vehicle was recovered in Cartside Road, Busby, but a quantity of Nitrazapan
tablets were missing.
Nitrazapan is an anti-depressant and sedative and is dangerous if taken by
those who have not had it prescribed.

ALEX Ferguson has thrown away the protective cloak surrounding his crop of
talented youngsters, as well as Andy Cole, in an attempt to revive Manchester
United's championship challenge.
Ferguson has carefully nurtured young talents like Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Paul
Scholes, Gary Neville and David Beckham by shielding them from criticism, as he
did with #7m striker Cole, who has scored just three times this season.
But after Saturday's 2-2 draw with Sheffield Wednesday - when United were
without Peter Schmeichel, Giggs, Denis Irwin, Gary Pallister, Butt and Roy
Keane - Ferguson gave his youngsters and star striker a public dressing down.
``We had three glaring chances and it does not matter how you are playing, if
you miss like that you will always regret it. Our young players lacked the
experience to handle Wednesday, but I think we all know we should be expecting
more from them.
``They have set the standards themselves, and cannot be cradled all the time.''

WOULD many of you out there know that rugby started from Rugby School rules
about 1820 and it took 50 years for the Rugby Football Union to organise itself?
It was in 1871 that the English established the RFU and Scotland followed suit
10 years later with the SRU. But in the meantime, rugby had a strong following
in the north of England, especially in Yorkshire, Lancashire and Chesire, and
this was where it was a working class sport. And as happened in Association
Football, the lads of the shires felt they were due compensation for the loss
of wages, so they invented the rugby league game.
And it changed rugby. It is a dangerous game at the best of times. Thus scrums
are banned from what became a professional game. Union, you understand, has
somewhat of a basis for rugger, the scrum. But scrums are indeed dangerous.
What made amateur rugby sort of safe was simply that the players enacted their
sport for fun and not for the sake of a ribboned coat as Newbold's poem has it:
they played on bleak winter afternoons for fun. This is to change. Players will
play, now, even in little Scotland, for money.
Nowadays it is not much money - even at top level, international level - a
player will make little more, if they get the negotiations right at that, than
#22,500 a year. This is about the same amount as a minor English cricketer can
achieve and a bloody sight less than a soccer player with an IQ of eight can
earn in a month.
The result sounds splendid to a young rugger player of 18 who cannot get to
college or university. Such a young man will do what young soccer lads do - he
will put all his eggs into one basket and go pro. He will doubtless end up so
saturated with the demand for a victory and a salary that he will kill for it.
Watch his boots on the ground in the next few years.
Knowledgeable and more academic boys will think to themselves what advantage is
there in earning a small amount out of a game which they hitherto thought of as
a sport and will not take it up as a profession. They will continue to train as
doctors and lawyers and teachers and professional people. If we have anything
to learn from Europe and Association football it is that.
The reason why European soccer is better than the UK product is that they still
attract well-educated and professional people into their game and have not
imbued their sports with the disastrous class system which is endemic, not just
to British life, but especially so to British sport.
But what do the amateurs who play rugby say. To find out I visited Cartha
Queen's Park.
This is an old old club. Cartha started back in 1889. It is a big club, though
not especially prominent in Scottish rugby but known for a well-developed youth
policy.
Cartha stalwart Brian Gervase put it to me succinctly. ``I learned rugby at
Queen's Park Secondary, the old school. David Atkins taught me: he was the
maths teacher. It was the first year we didn't have a rugby team. Two years
later we won the Secondary Schools Cup, and I've been playing now for 30
years.''
He swept a hand round the well-appointed clubhouse. ``Look at these lads. Some
of them are too heavy to play any other game at all. The little boys are too
wee to play anything other than mini. Their mums and wives and daughters and
sons are all here watching the under-16's Glasgow Southern (this is a combine
of Clarkston and Cartha) against Stirling County. Amateur is the lifeblood of
the game''.
There is a lifeblood here, too. Indications are that Cartha are in line for
planning permission for an all-weather pitch complete with nearly #700,000
worth of grant from a variety of organisations, though rumours suggest that the
factor wants to block this and the National Trust for Scotland are not
sympathetic.
Not unreasonably, nobody at Cartha wants to admit this, but rumours have an
awful habit of ending up as truth. But this is not a rumour at all. Cartha and
rugby clubs like it have worked hard to be sporting communities. And they
didn't do it for money. Or for a ribboned coat at that.

AMEC will claim this week that the #360m bid from Kvaerner will put its
developing business in Indonesia at risk.
The group has taken time to develop relationships in the country and hopes to
get part of the work associated with the huge #30bn Natuna offshore gasfield,
whose development is due to start in about two years' time.
Amec is a partner with a local state-owned shipbuilder, PT Pal, and is also
involved with Trafalgar House and a Japanese company to bid for offshore
platforms for use in Natuna. It could be asked to bid to supply up to 18
platforms.
It believes that the Indonesians want to have a balance of suppliers from
various countries and would be put off Amec, should it come under Norwegian
control. If Amec lost out then other UK suppliers such as GEC and British
Aerospace would also feel the impact.
Meanwhile, as the bid moves into its final week, Kvaerner has attacked Amec's
defence document issued on Friday, saying that the group forecasts another
disappointing year in 1995 and that the balance sheet remains weak.
Mr Erik Tonseth, Kvaerner chief executive, says in a letter to shareholders
despatched over the weekend: ``Amec forecasts that its turnover will increase
in 1996. However it says nothing about profits and dividends. In the past Amec
has repeatedly expressed optimism for the future only for the actual results to
be remain static.''

BTHIS year's mergers and acquisitions boom is bringing huge Christmas bonuses
to senior employees of the City of London's big securities houses and none more
so than those working for Barings, the failed bank which was rescued in March
by the Dutch insurance giant, ING, which paid the princely sum of #1 for the
business.
The main investment banking business was kept intact under a new chief
executive Hessel Lindenbergh and, as if it had had something to prove, the
mergers and acquisitions team has been among the most successful, being
involved with deals worth some #24bn this year.
As a result its top employees are expected to share at least #20m, with senior
corporate finance staff getting some #500,000 each for their role in such deals
as ScottishPower's #1100m bid for Manweb, where Barings acted for the former.
The company was also involved in a number of other major deals, including
acting for Welcome when it received an offer from Glaxo and for Lloyds Bank in
its bid for TSB.
This year is set to be a record for takeover activity, easily surpassing 1994
and even exceeding 1989, the last boom year before the recession struck. The
final value of deals struck will probably top #50bn against #47bn in 1989.
Then financial engineering was much in vogue, but this time the merger boom is
being driven by commercial reasons, principally the need to drive costs ever
lower to meet competitive conditions and in the case of utilities to get the
benefit of their guaranteed cashflow.
With investment banks receiving extra fees if the bidder they are acting for
succeeds in a contested offer, as in the ScottishPower case, some #1000m is
thought to have cascaded into their coffers this year.
The securities houses themselves have been through a shake-up with, apart from
Barings, other blue-blooded names like Kleinwort Benson and Warburgs changing
hands.
Barings' staff connected with Nick Leeson and his catastrophic derivatives
trading or subsequently criticised will not receive bonuses, though other staff
shared some #90m of bonuses in respect of 1994, to the fury of Barings'
creditors.
ING was obliged to pay them to retain staff to enable the securities business
to go forward. Otherwise they would have drifted away. The former chairman,
Peter Baring, deputy chairman Andrew Tuckey and head of investment banking
Peter Norris did not receive 1994 bonuses.
The new payments to be made to Barings staff will inevitably further anger the
company's creditors which suffered badly from the crash.

SHARON Bissett was recalled to the Scottish indoor training squad on Saturday,
when national coach Andrew Scoular made a fleeting visit to the indoor league
at Meadowbank.
Bissett celebrated yesterday by scoring four times as Edinburgh Ladies defeated
Menzieshill 11-1 in the quarter-finals of the Indoor Cup.
This triumph completed a great weekend for the capital girls, who on Saturday
had not only forced a 2-2 draw against Western Klick Photopoint without three
of their key players, Gill Messenger, Diane Renilson and Pauline Robertson, but
also opened up a two-point advantage over their Glasgow rivals thanks to
Bonagrass Grove.
The Taysiders produced one of their finest ever performances in the league to
beat Western 3-2 with Audrey Sime scoring the winner on the final whistle from
a corner.
The teams met for a second time yesterday in the cup, but on this occasion
Western gained revenge, showing the form more in keeping with their standing in
the European scene by winning 5-2.
Western must, however, have thought that this was going to be a nightmare
weekend when Sime shot the Dundonians into the lead after just 12 seconds, but
with the game being played over the regulated 40 minutes instead of the 30 of
the league their mastery eventually shone through with the help of two goals
apiece from Wendy Fraser and Maureen White.
At 4-1 Grove employed the services of Alison Ramsay as a kicking back, but why
the umpire allowed the clock to be stopped for the change to be made must
remain a mystery. The tactic brought Grove a goal from Ramsay, but Western had
the final say, regaining their three-goal advantage.

NO doubt like thousands of others I am waiting rather impatiently to hear what
action the SFA proposes to take against the referee of the recent
Rangers/Aberdeen shambles which has been getting so much recent publicity.
In my opinion the referee was indirectly responsible for most of the troubles
and, in fact, it is surprising that the procurator-fiscal, through the police,
has not had him charged with the old common-law offence of conduct likely to
cause breaches of the peace because of his ineptitude.
He does not deserve to get off scot free and during a period of suspension he
should be sent for an eye test and made to resit a referees qualifying
examination.

BOWLS
WOMEN'S world indoor champion Joyce Lindores capped off a great year at
Ardrossan on Saturday when she recaptured the Scottish women's indoor singles
title.
Lindores, a winner in 1976 and last year's beaten finalist, took the crown when
she hit back from 12-2 down to edge out former women's world champion Kate
Adams from Auchinleck, 21-18.
Adams looked to be heading towards the title when, with eight ends completed,
she showed 12-2 ahead, but Lindores then enjoyed a run of two, three and three
that took her to within two of Adams' total at 10-12.
Lindores finally got in front for the first time when a twentieth end double
gave her a 17-16 lead and singles on the next two ends stretched her advantage
to 19-16.
Adams closed the gap with a twenty-third end double, but Lindores then counted
singles on each of the next two ends to wrap up her 21-18 victory.
In the semi-finals, Lindores beat off another Ayrshire challenge in Galleon's
Jean McFeddries, 21-15, while Adams defeated Dorothy Barr from Ayr, 21-6.
The pairs title went to Dundee's Margaret Gray and Dot Bannerman who coasted to
a 26-8 victory over Arbroath's Eleanor Anderson and Hilda Martin. Dundee led
9-8 after 11 ends and then picked up 17 shots without loss with Arbroath
finally surrendering after 19 of the scheduled 21 ends.
The triples title was won by Perth's Mandy Scott, Maureen Morrison and Evelyn
McGarvie who just held on to beat West Lothian's Christine McCormack, May
Newton and Greta Scott 18-16. Perth led 18-8 with four ends to play but a
strong finish from West Lothian took them to within two of the Perth total.
In the fours, Falkirk's Margaret Burt, Jean Hunter, Jane Brooksby, and Roberta
Canavan sailed through to the final with a 30-8 win over defending champions
Galleon and lined up against Ayr's Agnes Johnstone, Margaret Baird, Jean Taylor
and Grace Hay who had beaten Arbroath 25-17 in their semi-final. Ayr raced to a
12-3 six end lead although Falkirk hit back to lead 16-14 after 15 ends.
Ayr then took a 19-18 lead into the concluding end, but it wasn't enough to
give them the title with Falkirk picking up three shots for a 21-19 victory.

IF Alison Carr betrayed a pensive look yesterday when she won the final
Scottish women's cross-country league race of the season, the Lita Allan
Memorial event at Kirkcaldy, then she could be forgiven.
The 29-year-old Dundee Hawkhill Harrier capped her return to competitive
athletics, after an absence of more than 10 years, to relaunch her
international career - a career which once appeared even more promising than
that of her former schoolmate, world and Commonwelth champion Liz McColgan.
Following a year behind McColgan at St Saviour's in Dundee, and a member of the
same athletics club, she trained regularly with her and they shared the same
coach, the late Harry Bennett.
Carr had already won the Scottish age-group 1500m title when she broke
McColgan's school and Dundee schools records for the event. After Carr won the
British Schools cross-country in Dublin and took second in the English national
championships, she had the chance of following McColgan to the USA.
``I was offered a scholarship to Iowa State, but never took it up,'' said
Alison, now a legal secretary. ``My parents were going through a divorce, and
my coach, Harry, died. I lost interest and just drifted out of athletics.
``Do I regret it? Well I drive past her house at Carnoustie and you can't help
thinking about the money she has made. But I don't have any regrets. I would
not have my husband, John, or my wee boy, Fraser - he's four and a half - if I
had gone to the USA.''
It was Fraser who was responsible for her return. ``We were driving near the
Hawkhill clubrooms when he was sick in the car. We popped into the club to
clean him up. It was the first time I'd been there in years, and one of the
coaches joked that it was time I started running again . . .''
That was two years ago, but she immediately lost a year, injured through
training too intensely. ``This is my first season back. I'm going to try the
half marathon next year, and the marathon in 1998. . .''
The year when a certain two-times Commonwealth gold medallist called McColgan
plans to make her Games debut in the marathon.
A second, two thirds, and yesterday's victory ensure Carr's inclusion among the
eight women whose performances over the four league races book places for the
Inter-league match at Birmingham on January 7. The two wild card selections to
complete teams of 10 in four age groups will tax the selectors' diplomacy.
Carr finished 22 seconds ahead of last year's winner, Fife AC's World Duathlon
Cup winner Fiona Lothian, leading Hawkhill to team victory.
Lothian, whose international triathlon and duathlon duties have kept her off
the country, could be one of the wild cards, but Glasgow medical student Shiela
Fairweather, the Scottish age-group champion, with wins in her only two
appearances should surely be first choice.
Also in the senior team, qualifying for a debut Scottish vest at 36, is Debbie
Macdonald, wife of Runrig guitarist/song-writer Rory, and sister of
international marathon runner Karen Macleod. Macdonald finished fifteenth - she
had raced the Hugh Wilson Memorial 10,000m event 24 hours earlier.
Terry Mitchell retained the men's trophy, his ninth win in 12 starts since 1981.
Women's Inter-area teams (wild card selections to be added):
Senior women: A Carr, Y Reilly, M Vannet, and G Hanlon (all Dundee Hawkhill), S
Lamb (Aberdeen) J Waterhouse (JGB Central) D Macdonald (Lasswade), S Kennedy
(Victoria Park). Under-20: L Harrison and A Hood (both Edinburgh AC), S
McNairney (Irvine), D Murray (Lasswade), A Kyle, L Green and F Day (all

SCOTT Cohen, shorn of his pony tail but not his strength, claimed the Hugh
Wilson Memorial 10,000 metres road race trophy at the East Kilbride Festival of
Road Running on Saturday, writes Doug Gillon.
The Leslie Deans Racing Club runner, selected by East District for next
weekend's inter-area cross-country at Cumbernauld, seemed to have undermined
West's hopes by bringing down four pillars of their squad for next weekend.
Of the five men immediately behind him in Saturday's McDonald's-backed event,
four - Ian Murphy, Charlie Thomson, Alex Robertson, and John Cowan - are in
West's area squad. So Cohen's victory by more than half a minute, looked
encouraging for East.
However, artist Cohen painted a bleak picture, as he revealed he has rejected
selection. ``Cumbernauld is downright dangerous - always heavy, with rocks
sticking through the surface. Besides, the meeting is devalued - It's not even
an international any more.''
Cohen's outburst - especially if he is backed by significant numbers of
colleagues - could be damaging for the future of the event. It has, for many
years, been backed by Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District, but such condemnation
is hardly calculated to win the support of the new unitary authority about to
take over.
Cambuslang swept all but one of the male team titles, but revealed they intend
to break new ground shortly, by launching a women's section.
City of Glasgow, however, remain the dominant female force. They had the first
three finishers to claim the women's team award, led home by Dr Audrey Sym. Sym
injured her back when winning the West cross-country two years go. She, too
will be sticking to the roads in future. Results:
1, S Cohen (Leslie Deans Racing Club) 30min 34sec; 2, I Murphy (Strathclyde
Firebrigade) 31-07; 3, C Thomson (Cambuslang) 31-15. Veteran: B Kirkwood (LDRC,
fourth) 31-16. Team: Cambuslang. Junior: M Campbell (Cambuslang, 21st) 34-50.

THE Lord Chancellor    Lord Mackay is said to    be peeved with Tory      Party
Chairman Brian Mawhinney. Mr George Robertson is entitled to be miffed with Mr
Tony Blair. Sir Edward Heath is irritated by the Prime Minister. Even Madam
Speaker Boothroyd is not exempt from criticism.
You can tell that the season of goodwill approaches, or it might be much worse.
It probably will be in the new year which presages, if Mr Major has his way, a
marathon General Election campaign before the hustings have even been announced.
Let us take these complaints in order and see what they amount to. Mr
Mawhinney, who was appointed to set Labour back on its heels, has advised
people to complain to judges and magistrates if they think their sentencing is
too lenient. This made Lord Mackay wince.
Unfortunately, the party chairman compounded this ``crime'' by suggesting the
contents of the speech that the Lord Chancellor was due to make in the
Guildhall, London. ``Lay off the Government,'' was the supposed message of this
speech to the judges in the wake of findings that Ministers - the Home
Secretary Michael Howard in particular - have been acting beyond their powers
and wrongly. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, was quick to criticise Mr
Howard's party conference speech.
If Lord Mackay ever intended to deliver such a caution to the legal fraternity,
he certainly did not do so at the Guildhall and wrote to the Times to complain
about being second-guessed. He requested an explanation from Dr Mawhinney and
his Central Office.
This is highly sensitive stuff. If the Tories can achieve nothing else against
Mr Blair, they desire to retrieve from him the issue of law and order. Today,
they launch their Asylum and Immigration Bill in the Commons to counter what Mr
Howard sees as an image of Britain being a ``soft touch'' for illegal entry.
The Tories need total solidarity on law and order. Any ministerial disputes are
greatly deplored by the Prime Minister who seems to be adopting an attitude
towards his party chairman of ``You may say that, but I could not possibly
comment''. He would not be the first to do so. In vain do the likes of Michael
Heseltine deny disputes; Labour's spin doctors delight in making mountains out
of such so-called mole-hills.
Who next? Ah, Mr Robertson. Now I don't know whether the Shadow Scottish
Secretary is miffed or not about Mr Blair's pronouncements on the ``tartan
tax'' in this newspaper. I just feel that he is entitled to be so. Would the
late John Smith have changed Labour policy like this on the hoof? I rather
think that Mr Blair's predecessor would be taking the view that he has put the
kybosh on taxation powers for a Scottish parliament. Mr Smith (and Mr
Robertson, for all I know) might be thinking that Mr Forsyth has won a
psychological victory, with Labour withdrawing to re-group.
The Liberal Democrats might do it, but I cannot see the Labour Party stating in
an election manifesto that, if elected, it will raise direct taxation in
Scotland. Mr Blair says that without this condition, a Labour-dominated
Edinburgh parliament would not use taxation powers. Get it? The powers are
essential, but they would never be used.
What happens if a Labour Government requires to put up direct taxation
globally, without specifically stating that it would do so in a General
Election manifesto? It would not be the first Government to do so. Would a
Labour-dominated Scottish parliament be entitled to say to the Chancellor of
the Exchequer: ``Not for us, old son; we're exempt''? And what would the Labour
Chancellor reply? ``Oh, right enough, I'd forgotten that bit - Scotland can pay
less tax than England and Wales.''
It hardly works better than the concept of Scotland being entitled to pay more
tax than south of the Border. I suspect that Mr Forsyth is going to have a lot
more to say about this and that is one reason why, if I was Mr Robertson, I'd
be miffed with Mr Blair. I would have to scratch my head even harder over the
coming months to sort this one out.
The Prime Minister has some head-scratching to do too. Here we have Sir Edward
Heath again (on BBC TV yesterday) complaining that Mr Major is making no
attempt to explain to the nation the positive aspects of a European single
currency. Previously, in Commons debate, he had stamped on the strange
Euro-sceptic notion that the Government should publish a White Paper stating
its targets for the Maastricht II negotiations on further European union.
It is essential to Mr Major to maintain some kind of truce over Europe within
his parliamentary party. He is trying to dance on a pin, like Mr Blair on the
``tartan tax'' issue. It doesn't help when Sir Edward voices his irritation
that the Prime Minister will not declare for a single currency, later if not
sooner. Other Tories want him to state now that Britain will never enter a
single currency; others still wish he would at least promise that it will not
happen this side of the millennium.
The likelihood is that he will compromise, like Mr Blair (whose party is split
also), and commit himself to a referendum before a decision on a single
currency. The irritating thing here for Mr Major is that such a move would
spoil his chances of ``clear blue water'' between Tory and Labour on Europe. If
Mr Blair succeeds in fudging the ``tartan tax'' issue, there is less ``clear
blue water'' in Scotland too.
What has Speaker Boothroyd got to do with all this? Nothing at all, except that
it might be part and parcel of the general rattiness. She is murmured by a
handful of Tory loudmouths as being biased towards Labour in the Commons.
This began about a year ago when the Tories were scrapping among themselves
over their leadership and European policy. It reappeared last week after she
had given the whole House a wigging about the rise in personal abuse.
There is much humbug and only minuscule criticism of Speaker Boothroyd, even
when she does her duty and exerts the right of the Commons, and back benchers
in particular, to call the Government to account. She is the best Speaker for
20 years, if you want my biased opinion.

PRESSURE is building for tougher laws and harsher sentences to crack down on
the offence of carrying a knife in public. It is being led by rank-and-file
police officers, who appealed to the Government yesterday to give them the
power to arrest young thugs who carry knives.
The appeal, by the Metropolitan Police Federation, came in the wake of the
murder of headmaster Philip Lawrence.
Mr Lawrence, 48, was killed outside St George's Roman Catholic Church in Maida
Vale, north-west London, on Friday as he tried to protect a 13-year-old boy
being attacked by a teenage gang.
At the moment, police can arrest someone for unlawfully possessing a knife only
if an officer believes the suspect will use it.
Mr Mike Bennett, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said that when
offenders were arrested they were often let off with a caution.
The current system was a ``charter for laziness''. He went on: ``We need a
simple power of arrest for possession of a blade of more than three inches
without authority or reasonable excuse, so that they go before the courts.
``We believe the criminal record will be the deterrent. The youngsters know we
do not have the powers.''
The federation met the Home Office in October to press the case for tougher
laws but Mr Bennett said he failed to win support from senior police officers.
Mr Bennett said statistics showed that a knife was now the second favourite
weapon for assault and that in London a knife was involved in 4200 robberies
last year, making it the most widely used weapon for that crime. There were
seven stabbing attacks every day in London. Nationwide, knives were used in one
killing in three, and last year took the lives of 130 men and 60 women.
Mr Fred Broughton, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales,
which has 126,000 members, said the murder of Mr Lawrence was a ``defining
moment'' in the fight against the knife culture. ``There must be legislation to
ban the sale of knives designed to injure. The Crown Prosecution Service must
recognise that possession of a knife needs to go before a court and these
courts must impose sentences that really do act as a deterrent,'' he said.
However, Home Secretary Michael Howard said he would not change the law as a
``knee-jerk reaction to one event, however dreadful''. He described the attack
as ``absolutely appalling'' and said the law in relation to knives was already
under review.
``We are consulting the Association of Chief Police Officers about this,'' he
said. ``We were in touch with them about it before this tragic event occurred.
If we think there is advantage in stiffening the law, then that is something we
will do.''
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw has called for the law to be toughened to
tackle what he described as an ``epidemic'' of knife carrying on the streets.
``This is a desperate tragedy,'' he said. ``The carrying of knives on the
streets is epidemic and it is extremely worrying. Labour will co-operate with
the Government on getting new legislation through.''
Mr Alun Michael, shadow home affairs spokesman, said: ``Labour has long
recognised the increasing problem of violence and that is why we proposed
amendments to the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act to tackle the
possession of weapons and violence on the streets. It is now clear that the
courts need tougher penalties for the possession of knives.
``The Home Secretary should also give strong support to the police, the local
authorities, and local communities in identifying any developing culture of
violence or weapon carrying in their community, and nipping these in the bud.''

CURLING
HAMMY McMillan's team of Norman Brown, Mike Hay, and Roger McIntyre made a
winning start to the defence of their title here with an 8-5 victory over
Austria in the opening round robin game of their section at the Eufopean
Curling Championships. They followed that up with a 6-4 win over the
Netherlands in their evening match.
In the second game, the Dutch gave McMillan's team a run for their money,
blanking the first two ends before scoring a 2 at the third.
McMillan had a chance to take the lead at the next end, but his final stone was
too thin and rolled on too far, leaving him to settle for a 2 to level the
scores.
A steal of 1 at the fifth end when the Dutch could only remove two of three
Scottish counters gave Scotland the lead for the first time at 3-2.
The Dutch responded with a single at the sixth to level again, but a straight
hit by McMillan with his last stone at the seventh end gave him another 2 for a
decisive 5-3 lead.
The teams swapped singles at the next two ends and the Dutch could not get back
on terms at the tenth to give the Scots their 6-4 win.
In McMillan's opening game yesterday, he also found himself down at the start
when Austria took a single at the first end, but the Scots responded with a 2
at the second when McMillan drew on to the button with his final stone. Austria
drew level at the third and in the fourth, when McMillan was too heavy with a
draw, they stole a single to retake the lead at 3-2.
Until this point, the Scots had not been firing on all cylinders but, at the
fifth end, McMillan played a hit and stay to score 3 and put the Scots clear.
Austria came back with a single for 4-5 at the sixth end and a pick-up on
McMillan's last stone on the seventh meant it was blanked.
McMillan played a solid hit to promote his own stone at the eighth to give
himself another 3. Austria scored a consolation single at the ninth and then
ran out of stones at the last end.
After the games, McMillan said: ``It's always hard to make a start at these
events and we're just relieved to have won.
``The Austrians play in an unorthodox way, and the Dutch game was tricky, but
there are no mugs left in this competition now.'' Results:
MEN: Round 2. Group A1 - Austria 1, Norway 6; Netherlands 4, Scotland 6;
Finland 5, Germany 7; Group A2 - Italy 9, Sweden 6; Denmark 6, England 4;
Switzerland 7, Wales 6 (after extra end).
Scotland end scores:
Scotland  020 030 030X = 8
Austria  101 101 001X = 5
Scotland  000 210 201X = 6
Netherlands  002 001 010X = 4

DARNLEY: A Life of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, Consort of Mary Queen of Scots
By Caroline Bingham
Constable: #18.95
THIS is a short life and a cautionary one. The young man is in a hurry.
Darnley, King of Scots? Sounds good. Henry, King of Scots? Let's have it in
writing.
Accordingly, the silver ryal that commemorates the 1565 wedding is inscribed:
Henricus et Maria D Gra R&amp;R (Rex et Regina) Scotorum, and Mary's wedding eve
proclamation says unequivocally, ``Forasmekill as we intend...... to solemnizat
and compleit the band of matrimonie in face of Hallie Kirk with the rycht
nobill and illuster Prince Henry Duke of Albany (a title bestowed a mere eight
days earlier): in respect of the whilk marriage...... we will, ordane, and
consentis, that he be namit and stylit King of this our Kingdom...... our
future husband and us as King and Queen of Scotland conjunctlie.''
But first Parliament has to ratify it and already Mary is having morning-after
thoughts. She has known the young man but five months, two of which he spent in
bed with ``mesels'', though posterity unkindly suggests syphilis.
And he is pushy - arrogant, impatient, and all too plainly desperate to get his
hands on the Crown Matrimonial that will make him an equal partner. Mary
equivocates. He turns surly and thwarted.
And so, mainly for reasons of personality, his moment passes, the crown eludes
him, his early death is destined and the writing on the wall says
Famous-for-five-minutes toy boy almost rules OK.
Before he vanishes into the great Scottish surname sludge of written history,
the plottings, the bet-hedging, the cross-country gallops, he impresses us
strongly with his name and little more. And until Caroline Bingham, 428 years
on, decided to follow up her distinguished biography of James VI and I with a
book devoted to Darnley, no-one had considered him a suitable solo subject.
Compare this with the 20,000 volumes Antonia Fraser found listed for Mary and
his bitterness is eternally justified.
On the cover of this long-overdue book his face like a Size 1 egg, minimally
painted, stares out across the ruff, too big for its features. The excess of
height and energy, the lack of experience, give him a toppling, unbalanced look
that seems more than physical. In common with Mary he was considered dazzlingly
handsome and their shared genetic heritage must have made them an awesome pair,
she 6ft-tall, he perhaps as much as 6ft 4in, ``almost the tallest man in the
isle of Britain'' according to a contemporary.
Yet the apparent suitability of the match was compromised before it was made,
Bingham shows us, by an inordinate ambition, an ambition that is the product of
Scottish, English, and French history, the complexity of medieval blood lines
and the immense power of the throne to dominate the lives and aspirations of
all those close to it.
Darnley's mother, Lady Margaret Douglas, was the daughter of Margaret Tudor -
sister of Henry VIII and James IV's Queen - by her second marriage to the
politically ambitious Earl of Angus. As half-sister of James V and cousin of
Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth she spent most of her early years as a political
pawn between her warring parents and between the Scottish and English courts.
Her first betrothal to Lord Thomas Howard, a fellow-member of Henry's court,
though sanctioned by the king, more or less coincided with his decision to
dispatch Anne Boleyn and marry Jane Seymour.
Since Howard was related to Anne Boleyn, Henry believed that Margaret, already
a possible claimant of the English throne, might be manoeuvring to improve her
position, and sent them both to the Tower. Later he came up with the expedient
of having her declared illegitimate (a wrong her mother later righted) and
having her renounce the liaison.
Margaret then married Matthew Earl of Lennox, great-great-grandson of James II,
who considered himself the best claimant to the Scottish throne if the direct
line failed. Brought up in France, his life was devoted to the aggrandisement
of his family, and having failed in his suit for the Queen Dowager, Marie de
Guise, mother of Mary Queen of Scots, he turned his attention to Margaret.These
were Darnley's parents.
Taking possession of a palatial new home at Temple Newsam in Yorkshire, they
brought up young Henry to equip him for the highest office.
``It was accepted that the boy must learn Latin to join the international elite
of educated people who could read or write a Latin letter...... understand an
allusion to a mythical god or hero, and cap a classical quotation. This was not
to be learned as a Renaissance polymath understood it; but it was to be
cultured as the Renaissance prince or nobleman aspired to be.''
In dancing and in lute playing, in horsemanship and martial arts, the adult
Henry was to be rated highly, and his penmanship was particularly admired. Of
these rather shallow, doggedly acquired accomplishments the most recent echo is
in Jane Austen. Powerful, significant and wealthy they may be, but they are
dependent on patronage for the fulfilment of their desires. Waiting, scheming,
and penning elaborate greetings takes up much of their time and favour descends
on them as capriciously as on Mr Bennett's daughters.
In 1559 Henry II of France died, 15-year-old Francois succeeded, and the
13-year-old Darnley was sent to the French court to congratulate him and his
16-year-old wife the Queen of Scots. The well-born teenagers were on the brink
of an enduring celebrity.
A year later Francois died and Henry was back, bearing eager condolences. All
of this was reported to Elizabeth, now on the English throne, who, as Mary
arrived in Scotland, had the family arrested. Releasing them, she detained
Darnley at the English Court.
When at last he arrives in Scotland and meets Mary for the third time he is 19.
``Now,'' notes Bingham, ``she was admiring him as a man, and perhaps for the
first time considering him as a suitor''.
Retaining the superb hand-writing of his youth he has cast off the flowery
sycophantic style, to address her in courtly verse, breathtaking in its
directness, beginning: ``My hope is yow for to obtaine/Let not my hope be lost
in vaine......'' However, he was not a match for the powerful older nobles and
earls, the skilled opportunists and the complex factions of a country
bedevilled by succession problems and devious neighbours. Implicated in the
murder of Rizzio, of whom he was unnecessarily jealous, he was shown up as far
from the strong dependable partner Mary was looking for.
It is hard to consider sixteenth-century history without supplying hindsight
and an all-knowing Shakespearian cast. What comes across most powerfully from
this picture of Darnley's life and times is the possibility of inadequacy, the
constant extemporising, the fragility of all enterprise compared to the strong
sense of self. We see Mary, casting around for a second husband, consider Don
Carlos of Spain, who, unknown to her, is both physically deformed and mentally
handicapped.
Watching them all in their optimism and ignorance is like watching the
contestants line up for Blind Date. Good-looking self-assured young people pen
flowery prose to possible partners they have never seen, promising the prize of
themselves, for reasons of self-promotion, ambition, and instant gratification.
The want-it-now syndrome. That's Darnley, dead at 22.

SCOTTISH game dealers and deer farmers are enjoying a boom in the run-up to
Christmas with sales of venison doubling as the doubts over beef products and
the controversial ``mad cow disease'' continue.
One deer farmer said venison stocks could run out because demand was so high.
Mr Peter Keracher, a Perth-based game dealer, said many people were opting for
venison instead of turkey and beef. ``Our sales have doubled,'' he said.
``People are very concerned about BSE and we cannot keep up with demand for
venison. We have sold out every day for the last couple of weeks. All kinds of
venison products, from steaks to sausages, are selling out.
``I don't like to see another industry suffer, but this increase in sales is
wonderful. Long may it last.''
A Dundee butcher, Mr Gilbert Grossett, has also seen a huge rise in demand for
venison. His shop sells venison sausages, burgers, mince, haggis, steaks, and
stew.
``We are stressing to our customers that beef is perfectly safe, but if people
want to try venison, we are happy to supply it. There is always a seasonal
increase in demand for venison but this year it has been amazing. We cannot get
enough of it,'' he said.
The increased demand for venison has benefited Scotland's 70 deer farmers who,
unlike cattle and sheep farmers, receive no Government assistance.
Pioneer deer farmer Mrs Nichola Fletcher, who runs Reediehill Deer Farm near
Auchtermuchty in Fife with her husband John, believes the healthy image of red
deer, raised in natural surroundings and fed on grass and potatoes, compares
favourably with the semi-industrial production of beef.
She said: ``People are mentioning BSE when they ring up to place an order. I
think they are reassured when they come here and see the deer grazing in the
field.''
Meanwhile, the debate about beef products and the controversy over bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) continues. Last week schools across Britain
were advised by a leading caterers' trade group, the Local Authority Caterers'
Association, to defy Government guidelines and steer away from beef products
until the problem was resolved.
The association backed moves by two of Scotland's leading private schools, the
Mary Erskine School and Fettes College, both in Edinburgh, to take beef
products off their menus.
Industry officials said last week that UK beef sales for November were 5% down
on
the same month last year. The Inverurie-based ANM Group, Scotland's largest
red-meat supplier and auction company, predicted beef prices would drop again
this week in what they described as ``almost a crisis situation.''
The Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers has sought to reassure the public
about the safety of beef.
Mr John Scott, the association's president, said the overwhelming body of
scientific evidence had discounted any suggestion of a link between BSE in
cattle and its alleged human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
He said the incidence of BSE had fallen dramatically to 25% of its peak level,
and stringent controls, including the incineration of affected carcases, had
been implemented to prevent infected material from entering the food chain.
Mr Scott appealed to consumers to listen to the views of scientists such as
Professor John Pattison, of London Medical School's department of medical
microbiology - chairman of the independent Spongiform Encephalopathy Ad- visory
Committee - and Dr Bob Wills, consultant neurologist in charge of the national
CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh.
He said both men had stated categorically that consumers had ``nothing to
fear'' from continuing to eat beef.
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg continued to insist that British beef was
``wholly safe'' and said parents should be encouraging children to eat it.
The five-star Four Seasons Hotel in London's Park Lane has defied Government
advice by taking beef liver, beef sausages, oxtail, and sweetbreads off its
menus.
Restaurant sources in Scotland have reported ``little or no effect'' on sales
of beef in restaurants.

DIRECTORS of Britain's 250 largest quoted companies gained a median increase of
just more than 7% in the last financial year - more than twice the 3% rate of
average earnings increase for other employees.
However, an Incomes Data Services report on directors' remuneration published
today also shows there were enormous variations around that median ranging from
an increase in total remuneration of more than 150% for a director of
Storehouse to a cut of nearly 75% for the chairman of SG Warburg.
Nearly #54m of notional profit was made from the excercise of share options by
225 directors over the years 1994 and 1995 and altogether six share option
millionaires were created over the period.
For the top paid director in each of the 250 largest quoted companies, the
median level of basic salary was just over #300,000 a year while the median
incentive payment was nearly #85,000 and the median gain from share options was
about #200,000.
The Royal Bank of Scotland's highest paid director Peter Wood was the highest
earner throughout all 250 companies despite a decrease in total emoluments
between 1993-4 and 1994-5. The largest single element was #13m paid in January
94 plus a #4m performance bonus from the bank's Direct Line insurance
subsidiary , a basic salary of #335,217, a profit share payment of #27,531 and
cash bonus of #17,000.
Other findings were:
q.14 directors earned more than #1m in the financial year 1994-5.
q.The highest fixed pay of just more than #2m went to a Thorn EMI director.
q.Six executives made more than #1m profit from excercising share options.
The report comments that levels of disclosure on directors' remuneration in
company accounts have greatly increased with at least half of the top 250
already complying with the Greenbury committee's code of practice.

EAST Kilbride are not a club who normally hog the limelight, but they captured
the attention of indoor enthusiasts on Saturday by defeating Stronachs AGSFP
18-8 to register not just the highest score of the season but also the highest
aggregate.
Richard Docherty, their 34-year-old play-maker, was as usual among the goals,
scoring five, but for once he was outshone by brother Angus, three years his
junior, who netted eight. Steve McCurry, another of the club's highly committed
indoor players, completed the rout.
Craig Strachan, the Morgan striker, was again on the goal trail after averaging
five goals in each of the Taysiders' three previous outings the week before.
This time he went one better, scoring all their goals in the 6-4 defeat of
Livingston.
He then went on to bring his aggregate to 26 for the season in their second
outing, against title contenders Stepps, but this is an encounter he will want
to erase quickly from his memory.
After scoring five of his side's goals to help establish an 8-7 lead with four
minutes remaining against the Lanarkshire side, Strachan's stick became
entangled with that of an opponent and the umpire sent him to the sin bin.
During his absence Stepps scored four goals in quick succession, through Martin
Monaghan, Scott Breckenridge, his fifth of the game, David Menzies and David
Black, en route to a 12-11 victory.
Stepps, having earlier beaten Harris 8-6, are now assured of their place in the
promotion play-offs, one point behind Clydesdale, who maintained their maximum
record with victories over Perthshire and Stronachs. Stevie Short was their top
scorer on the day with five goals, one ahead of Colin Moulson.

DREW Docherty is being asked to climb into the lion's den in February against
the highly-rated WBO bantamweight champion Daniel Jimenez.
Negotiations began yesterday to match the British champion from Condorrat with
the talented Puerto Rican hitman with Glasgow being suggested as the likely
venue.
It would be a joint promotion by one-time rivals Frank Warren and Tommy Gilmour.
The prospect of facing someone of Jimenez's stature could prove daunting for
the 30-year-old Scot, still trying to come to terms with the tragic death of
his last opponent, James Murray.
However, he may wish to erase the memory of his previous WBO title tilt in
February when he was KO'd in four rounds by Alfred ``The Cobra'' Kotey at
Cumbernauld.
Now Docherty - fast approaching the twilight of his six-year career - is being
pencilled in to meet slick moving Jimenez, who prised the WBO crown from Kotey
in London two months ago. This could be the last world title chance for
Docherty.
q.PAUL ``Scrap Iron'' Ryan landed the coveted Lonsdale Belt and Commonwealth
title trophy at York Hall, Bethnal Green on Saturday demolishing Bristol's Ross
Hale in 132 seconds.
Light-welterweight Ryan, who also holds the WBO inter-continental title, came
into boxing at 26 because of half-a-dozen visits to HM's prisons. Now 30, he
said after his triumph: ``I've got three belts now, these are the only things I
haven't nicked that I'm going to keep.
``Now I want to earn some real money. I'll be No.1 with the WBO and want a shot
at the world title.''
He did, though, earn some handy cash on the side by laying a #500 bet at 7-2 on
himself to relieve Hale of his titles.
With energy left to burn, Ryan will probably make the first defence of his
titles on the Prince Naseem Hamed promotion on February 10.

SOMEWHERE in the depths of a Brussels Eurocrat's filing cabinet there exists a
document which makes a remarkable claim. It is a mathematical formula, sort of,
which concludes that if an enlarged EU keeps the unanimity rule in the Council
of Ministers, then the difficulty in reaching agreement will be 40,000 times
greater than at present.
Can you imagine the fun? It would be the stuff of Tory Eurosceptics' dreams.
Don't ask me how the bureaucrats worked it out. I am told only that the theory
has been held up to the light and is deemed to be respectable. The prospects of
it being put to the test are dim, to say the least, despite the brave words
last week from the British who are, as ever, outnumbered on the veto issue by
14 to one.
After months of debate the EU's Reflection Group on Maastricht has formally
suggested how the Community should go about negotiations at the 1996
inter-government conference. Along the way our Government has frequently
claimed that on some issues the rest are coming round to ``our'' side.
Other member states have frowned on this liberal interpretation, taking the
philosophical view that nothing can be done about the ``British problem'' which
can be resolved only by a General Election and the arrival in Europe of
Euro-friendly Labour Ministers.
Some of us simple purveyors of the facts have said this all along. When we
suggested the balance of credibility lay with the Europeans we were taken aside
by chaps in suits and lectured on the error of our ways.
Well, call in evidence the chairman of the group, Carl Westendorp, the Spanish
European Minister. He said our man in the talks, the Eurosceptic European
Minister, David Davis, behaved like Douglas Hurd inside the meetings and
Michael Portillo outside. Mr Davis took some exception to this and Mr
Westendorp duly recast his criticisms as ``observations of style rather than
content''.
For months, his boss, Javier Solana, the class-act Spanish Foreign Minister who
is about to become Nato's secretary-general, has been saying there is not much
point in expecting significant agreement on streamlining Maastricht.
Why? Because Britain simply won't play. Best to wait until the British Tories
are dumped (I paraphrase him) and we get a more realistic set of UK Ministers.
It was in this atmosphere that Mr Davis showed up in Brussels last week,
noticeably more reticent about Britain winning the battle of wills.
Westendorp's report had just vindicated his critics.
Social chapter? Britain stands alone. More majority voting? Non-negotiable.
More real power for the European Parliament? Forget it. Majority voting in
foreign and defence policy? Give us peace.
So who's been telling tall tales? Well, first we should remember that the
Reflection Group has merely been talking about talks. This is not yet a
negotiation. In some areas - defence, for example, or voting weights in the
council - the British do have allies for some aspects of some policies.
There is now no headlong rush towards deciding a common foreign and security
policy by a qualified majority vote. Britain has stood firm on that and,
barring last-minute squalls, looks like retaining much of its ground. But in
other areas there seems to be little scope for genuine negotiation, so
implacable is the British stand. John Major has set the tone by saying in so
many words that this is a negotiation in which he won't negotiate.
Britain will go into the talks proper determined to wrest power back from
Brussels through subsidiarity. This should mean devolving decision-making from
the European Commission to whatever level of authority is deemed appropriate in
the member states.
Most other EU nations hand authority down to regional governments or local
councils but in Britain subsidiarity will continue to stop dead at Westminster
and socks to Scotland and Wales. Mr Davis has said there is ``no support'' for
subsidiarity being introduced below the level of national government. Plainly,
he listens only to like minds.
SOME months ago in Strasbourg I reported that Tony Blair's office had serious
problems with the proposed Scottish parliament's taxation powers. The word went
out from Labour's spin doctors that this was a lie and that it could be proved
as such because my conversation with a senior Labour figure had been secretly
tape-recorded. Just thought I'd mention it, if only for the record.

ALTHOUGH the fair-minded football supporter may be scarce he/she will, I
believe, concur with the sentiments of James Traynor in last Monday's Herald,
and I would like to think that other football journalists would adopt a similar
stance and have the courage to say so.
Clubs must consider the chief responsibility for their players' conduct -
winning at all costs has been taken to mean, it would appear, by tactics fair
or foul.
Sadly, football heroes of today are the Duncan Fergusons and Paul Gascoignes
and not the Tommy Walkers and Gordon Smiths of a bygone era and when if there
were any head-butters they were rightly suspended ``sine die'' and not treated
as heroes to be aped.

SCOTTISH Exiles' coach Al McHarg last night delivered an impassioned plea for
the survival of his side which has been part of the Scottish structure for 30
years.
The former Scotland lock warned that it would be madness for the Exiles, as a
side and a recruitment structure, to be abandoned, as seems possible under SRU
proposals which scrap the inter-district championship, but provide three
European Cup places for district sides.
He said that the Exiles were in the process of compiling a paper to go before
the SRU in which they would argue, in strong terms, for their survival.
McHarg's case was not helped yesterday when North and Midlands declared that
they were unlikely to play their championship tie against the Exiles on Sunday
because they would be without their Stirling County contingent due to the
crucial premiership game with Heriot's FP the previous day.
The Exiles' game against the South has already been a casualty of premiership
pressure.
Last night McHarg declared: ``If it's to be three sides in Europe, then what's
wrong with one of them being the Exiles?
``The issue which most people up here appear to have forgotten is that Scottish
forward play over the past decade and more has been heavily dependent on
Exiles' players. These are all players who have been discovered by the Exiles'
recruitment network.
``I'm talking about the likes of Andy Reed, Damian Cronin, David Hilton, and to
some extent Eric Peters.
Where would Scotland have been without them? If you take away the network which
discovers these players, and if you remove the vehicle which enables them to
ultimately play for Scotland, then what are they going to do? They are going to
go with England,'' he said.
``Personally, I don't give a damn, but if Scotland cuts off this lifeline, then
Scottish rugby will suffer. We can fight it, and we are with the report we are
preparing for the SRU. But it would be madness, absolutely mental, for Scotland
to go down this route.''
McHarg said that the argument about English clubs not releasing their Scottish
players to compete in Europe if Scottish district sides were to be in direct
competition with the English clubs was fallacious.
``In the current European competition, only three players from our
championship-winning side last season would be in this position. I can tell you
that the players we have here today are willing to negotiate with their clubs
on this issue before contracts are signed.
``It would be folly in the extreme for Scotland to abandon our recruitment
network which operates all over England seeking out those players. We have
60-plus exiles on our register. What happens to them if we are to go?''
Yesterday, North and Midlands discussed next weekend's situation with SRU
officials. ``So far as we're concerned we will not be playing, but January 10
might be an alternative,'' said North and Midlands secretary, John Methven.
SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said a decision would be taken early this week,
adding: ``The national selectors want to see the Exiles involved in a
meaningful match.
``Without the Stirling players, and the injured Rob Wainwright, Stewart
Campbell, and Martin Waite, this would not be a meaningful game.''

YOU know what it's like at interviews. You leave and immediately think of 14
other things you should have asked about; 10 other things you should have said,
all of them meaningful. You worry about what you were wearing, about being
there 10 minutes later than you promised.
And why is it that you have total recall of the last idle gossip you had with a
pal, but, such was the stress factor at this more formal encounter, you can
hardly remember a damn thing they said to you about possible start dates,
expected level of commitment, working relationships? Jeez.
Being interviewed by a prospective puppy blows the mind. See what I mean. The
puppy isn't prospective at all. The puppy is there. The puppy has been around
for seven whole weeks with six sisters, two brothers, and a kitten with whom
they all sleep and who is going to have one hell of an identity crisis a few
months down the line.
But none of this I know yet, as I turn, fatally, to the small ads section of
this newspaper one week ago and idly scan the pets column.
For most of this exercise I am calm. We do not want a Rotweiller or any of
those dogs two sizes up from rats and just about as aesthetically appealing.
Gerbils, hamsters, and rabbits are strictly for those households with small
children and guilty parents.
But just as I'm almost home free, an advert leaps off the page, advising me
there are puppies available of the breed which last shared our lives until it
was time to take to the great kennel upstairs.
Now if you are looking for a dog with keen intelligence, razor-sharp hearing,
20-20 vision and a sense of territorial rights which renders all other form of
burglar-proofing equipment superfluous, then this breed is definitely not for
you.
It is rumoured that Tibetan Terriers were once pretty high in the pecking order
at the palaces of the great and mountaintop good in their country of origin.
One report even suggested, ludicrously, that they served as guards at the gates.
These days your only hope of using them as front-line troops in personal
emergencies is that they just may lick an intruder into partial submission. In
short they are terminally soppy. I like that in a dog.
It is this uncritical admiration which cat persons contrive to scorn - the
knowledge that should you have the temerity to pop to the    off-licence for a
packet of crisps this little guy will greet your return in the manner you might
expect had you just spent three months crossing the North Atlantic in a coracle.
So when Charley left us there was a great big void where this mobile fun
factory had been. But what with a spell of city centre living and the
conviction he was pretty well irreplaceable, the years went by dog free. But
you never quite shake off the notion do you? There is always that core yearning
for another furry friendship.
And when you find yourself unable to get from A to B without hugging dogs
belonging to complete strangers who were merely going about their lawful
perambulation, you begin to pick up other strange habits. Like looking at small
ads.
But of course the whole idea is crazy. People phone this house inquiring if I
might be free on October 10, 1996, and I can't even tell them where I'll be
next Wednesday. This unresolved and pretty constant chaos      is surely no
place for a           self-respecting home-loving puppy. We can't be serious.
Still, a phone call cannot hurt. After all, she may only have bitches and I
want a dog. She may only have honey coloured and that's too close to Charley to
avoid unfair personality comparisons. She may have got rid of them all already.
I call. They have two left. Both dogs. Neither honey. In fact, one is chocolate
coloured. You do know that you can't show chocolate-coated Tibetans, the lady
advises me. That's a relief. Running around showrings in tweeds with a pocket
stuffed with Good Boy choc drops has never really been my thing.
So we make an appointment. The two available are in a makeshift pen in the
living room carefully lined with newspaper on the grounds that the intestinal
arrangements of small dogs are unpredictable. But they are lifted out for
inspection. The chocolate-coloured fella is a real beauty. Timidly curious with
a face like a kid's teddy.
His brother is not timidly curious. His brother screams around knocking over
anything which comes to hand. He examines my nose with his teeth. He saunters
into my open handbag, effortlessly selects the new 1996 diary inserts and
starts to shred them. I like his style.
In fact, as I write, I have about my person a photograph of him aged five weeks
which the breeder just happened to have to hand. Smart lady this breeder.
So today is D-day. D for dog and D for big decision. Today we have to call and
say: ``Excuse me, if the wheaten-coloured hooligan is still looking for a
lifetime lease on new lodgings we'd like him to shortlist us.''
Or we have to be sane and sensible and mature and reflect that having a dog
imposes all kinds of discipline and restrictions and maybe we're not grown up
enough to handle it.
In fact, maybe we should go for an hour or so in the crisp wintry sunshine and
think about it with a clear head. Hey, I haven't had a good walkie in years.

AYR Conservative MP Phil Gallie has threatened to shut down the all-party
Commons Scottish Affairs committee in protest at what he says was unfair media
criticism of the committee's recent 12-day fact-finding trip to New Zealand,
writes Benedict Brogan.
Yesterday, he raised the prospect of other Tories joining him in a walk-out if
reaction to the committee's report on agriculture is critical of the decision
to send nine of the committee's 11 members - including Mr Gallie - half-way
around the world, at a cost to the taxpayer estimated at up to #50,000.
The committee's Tory majority is made up with the help of three English MPs
drafted in to supplement its three Scottish back benchers - Mr Gallie, Eastwood
MP Allan Stewart, and Tayside North MP Bill Walker.
As part of its investigation into Scottish agriculture, the committee arranged
a visit to New Zealand to study the country's rejection of farm subsidies. They
travelled with the permission of the Whips and did not miss a Commons vote.
However, MPs on both sides of the House attacked the trip. As reported in The
Herald, several MPs questioned the usefulness of MPs, some of them with urban
constituencies, taking part in such a visit at a time when the Commons is under
pressure to justify its use of taxpayers' money.
In an interview for BBC2's Scottish Lobby programme yesterday, Mr Gallie said
the committee would not be able to function with a majority made up entirely of
English Tories.
``If one or two of us, myself included, were to pull out, it would leave the
committee with nowhere to go, to be quite honest,'' he said.
He has put his case to other members of the committee. Asked if they might join
him in a walk-out, he said: ``That could be the case.'' Neither Mr Walker nor
Mr Stewart could be contacted yesterday.
Mr Gallie claimed the Scottish Select was not the first parliamentary committee
to visit New Zealand this year. Three others had also visited the country and
nobody complained, he said.
The Ayr MP said he was surprised and angered by the criticisms of the visit.
``Quite honestly, I think for some reason or other, the Scottish press has
picked up on this one. They don't realise that other committees have been there
and, for whatever reason, they have picked up on the Scottish issues.'' ``I'm
fed up with the cheap, sleazy media, who constantly look for cheap lines to
sell newspapers. I believe that's what they have done in this particular case.''

SCOTTISH CUP
THE road to Hampden began at Stranraer on Saturday with the elimination of the
home side being the only progress made in the first round of the Tennents
Scottish Cup.
Livingston, third division leaders, once again proved giant-killers and
inflicted second division Stranraer's first home defeat by the comprehensive
margin of 3-0.
However, that was not the way the match began. Manager Jim Leishman said later:
``They were up for it before we were. But once Robert Douglas made a couple of
good saves we grew from strength to strength.''
Veteran striker Graham Harvey, scorer of two goals and with a hand in the other
one, was named man of the match but there were other candidates - speedy winger
Grant McMartin and Douglas for an inspired second-half penalty stop.
After Young had hooked wide from 12 yards the dangerous Livingston side went
ahead on the half-hour. McMartin dispossessed Tommy Walker in midfield and fed
Harvey, who turned inside Tony Gallagher and sent in a high right-foot shot
which dropped behind the Stranraer keeper into the net.
Eight minutes later Walker again lost possession. Tommy Graham supplied
McMartin and he took a return pass from Harvey to send over a cross with Young
headed back out for Martin Duthie to drive the ball home as the defenders were
pulled all ways.
Stranraer's big chance came midway in the second half when Graeme Davidson
brought down Henderson. Graham Duncan's strong shot was blocked and smothered
by Douglas, diving to his left.
Leishman's men completed the job in the dying seconds. Young ran from inside
his own half and released the ball to Harvey, who dragged it round Ross before
shooting home.
In the second round on January 6 Leishman's men will visit Caley Thistle at
Inverness.
Stenhousemuir's postponed tie against Arbroath will go ahead tomorrow night at
Ochilview, while Albion Rovers will entertain Deveronvale and Glasgow
University host Spartans next Saturday in the other rearranged matches.
q.BRECHIN City, who entertain Livingston next Saturday, cut the gap to five
points behind the third-division leaders, beating East Stirlingshire 4-1 in a
game brought forward from December 30.
On a slippery pitch Iain Lee gave 'Shire the lead but Graham Christie soon
levelled. A Bobby Brown header put Brechin ahead before the break and further
goals came from a Harry Cairney penalty and a header by Craig Farnan.

VOTING begins tonight among Labour Party members in Govan to decide whether MP
Mike Watson or businessman Mohammed Sarwar fights the seat for Labour at the
next election.
The contest has been one of the most bitter in recent times. Friends of Mr
Watson, MP for Glasgow Central, say they are confident of winning.
``The only thing that will stop us is if people have been telling us lies about
who they are voting for,'' said one of his campaigners.
Some 568 party members are eligible to vote. More than 400 have applied for a
postal vote. This is not to suggest that Govan people take foreign holidays in
early December. It is just that applying for a postal vote leaves nothing to
chance such as missing the voting meeting.
The remainder cast their votes at local party meetings after being addressed by
the candidates. The first is tonight and covers the three wards of Govan,
Drumoyne, and Ibrox. The others follow on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.
All the votes, cast in a secret ballot, are kept sealed and will not be counted
until Thursday morning when they will be combined with the postal votes that
are returned. The winner will be announced on Thursday afternoon.
There are three candidates on the election form. The third is Ms Margaret
Curran, but she is simply not quoted in what is a clear two-horse race. Voting
though is on the single transferrable system. In other words, if neither Mr
Watson or Mr Sarwar has a clear majority after the first ballot, Ms Curran's
votes will be redistributed according to the second choices of her supporters.
Throughout the lengthy campaigning period there were claims and counter-claims
of dirty tricks being played which dominated the media coverage, although there
appeared to be little substance to what they might be.
Certainly Mr Watson's supporters were able to challenge more than 50 of the
members who were regarded as supporters of Mr Sarwar. Labour headquarters
upheld more than 40 of the challenges, and this may be the deciding factor
which will win the nomination - and effectively a seat in parliament as it is a
Labour stronghold at General Elections - for Mr Watson.
The Scottish Labour Party hierarchy has kept its distance from the Govan
squabble, many opining privately that it would be good for the party, in order
to gather support from racial minorities, if Mr Sarwar won the nomination.
Inevitably, the contest has been regarded in racial terms at times. But Mr
Watson's supporters would prefer that it was seen in only political terms. Mr
Watson is a left-winger who supported Clause 4 and who voted for Mr John
Prescott, and not Mr Tony Blair, in the Labour leadership.
That will go down better with the traditional Labour members in Govan than it
does with the New Labour thinkers at headquarters - and possibly explains the
lack of tacit support for Mr Watson from key party officials.
If Mr Watson wins on Thursday, Mr Sarwar may continue to build a power base in
the constituency and try to defeat the sitting MP at the next election. He
could turn his attention to a Scottish parliament if Labour wins the election.
Few would argue that the Labour Party is so brimful of talent that it can
happily do without the skills of both able polticians.

UNION officials have warned of serious disruption at Hairmyres Hospital in the
new year if porters decide to take industrial action against their employers.
Porters at the East Kilbride hospital, who are members of Unison, are being
balloted to decide whether to take indefinite strike action against the private
contractor, Pall Mall, in a bid to secure union recognition and terms and
conditions.
Unison claims Pall Mall is refusing to recognise the union for collective
bargaining, despite signing an agreement with Unison earlier this year when
intervention by Acas - the Advisory, Conciliation, and Arbitration Service -
averted a threatened strike then.
Officials, who allege Pall Mall has ``torn up'' the deal, also say the
Hairmyres and Stonehouse NHS Trust should remove the management contract from
the company because it is, they claim, in breach of its contract with the trust.
Pall Mall employs all 41 porters and a casualty receptionist at Hairmyres,
together with a security guard at Udston Hospital. All are being balloted.
Unison's regional officer, Ms Bridget Hunter, said yesterday: ``After we
reached an agreement with Pall Mall that all sides appeared happy with, they
have now reneged on that deal and returned to their original hard-line stance.''
She added: ``Unison believes that the bad work practices of Pall Mall means
that they are in breach of their contract with the trust. We think the trust
should remove this contract from Pall Mall to ensure that quality services are
delivered to patients.''
Mr John Lambie, Unison's head of health in Scotland, warned yesterday that
industrial action by the porters - who are responsible for the movement of
patients, medical supplies, and specimens and the supply of meals to patients -
would have a ``fairly dramatic effect'' on the running of the hospital.
However, he added: ``If the company say they are prepared to put the agreement
we had back on the table I believe that could provide a good basis for further
negotiations.''
The porters are to meet at the hospital today, when union officials will brief
them about the timetable of the ballot.
Ballot papers were issued on December 1 and a result is due to be announced on
December 21.
No-one from Pall Mall could be contacted to comment on the dispute yesterday.

FORMER Tory Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath yesterday suggested he was ready to
vote with Labour leader Tony Blair in the Commons out of frustration at the
Government's increasingly anti-European position.
Warning that Euro-scepticism could lose the Government ``a lot of votes'', Sir
Edward signalled an unprecedented hardening of his opposition to the Tory
policy on Europe by suggesting he would be prepared to back a Blair government.
Although he has been a frequent and vociferous critic of the Euro-sceptic wing
of the party, and regularly attacked the policies of Margaret Thatcher, Sir
Edward never has gone so far as to back Labour.
However, interviewed on BBC1's On the Record programme yesterday, he said that
if the Tories were put into Opposition, he would judge a Labour Government's
European policy ``on its merits''.
``My principles on Europe are well known and what I want to achieve is also
well known. If they (Labour) are doing the right thing, then of course they
ought to be supported,'' he said.
He said Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was ``wrong'' to say there was
strength in Britain standing apart from other EU members on key issues and that
it would be ``undoubtedly'' more important for him to back a Blair government
on Europe if he disagreed with the Tory Party line.
In a robust attack on Government policy, Sir Edward criticised Mr Rifkind:
``There is no merit in isolation. I hope he can modify what he has been
saying,'' he said.
He rejected the idea of a White Paper on Britain's negotiating position for the
1996 Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) to renegotiate the Maastricht Treaty,
which Tory Euro-sceptics have been pressing the Prime Minister to produce.
It would be fatal, he said. ``You cannot say beforehand that this is what you
are going to get before you start negotiating. The real problem which faces
John Major is that he has undoubtedly got a divided party and he naturally
wants to keep it as united as he can before the next election.
``But my judgment is we shall lose a lot of votes as a party if we appear to be
anti-European. If we are going to remain in the European Union, we have got to
be positive and make a success of it.''
Speaking on the same programme, Foreign Office Minister David Davis rejected
Sir Edward's criticisms. ``Sir Edward is a very eminent ex-Prime Minister, and
his views on Europe are well known,'' he said.
Constructive engagement was necessary but this sometimes required the
Government to take a tough line in defence of the country's national interests,
he said.
``It is worth occasionally being isolated and holding your end of the argument
up so you can push it through and win the day,'' he said, as EU leaders prepare
for this week's Madrid Euro-summit.

Hibernian 0, Celtic 4
IT was unanimous. Hibernian's faint challenge for the premier division
championship was rendered hopeless as they conceded four more goals to the Old
Firm. This time Celtic took the Edinburgh side apart, and afterwards Tommy
Burns' players were convinced they now have the skills and the desire to break
Rangers' hold on the title.
Confidence is beginning to course through Celtic. This feeling of well-being
was evident in the way they walked away from Easter Road on Saturday night and
it had been obvious earlier in the way they played. No-one needed to say how
good they feel, but one or two did anyway.
The captain, Paul McStay, who has his testimonial match against Manchester
United at Celtic Park tomorrow night, agreed the team are playing as well now
as at any time in recent years and added: ``I know we won the Scottish Cup last
year, but winning the championship could be regarded as the real turning point
for us.''
The most significant point about McStay's words was that he actually mentioned
the title and Celtic in the same breath, and he wasn't just mouthing words
either.
McStay, like the rest of Celtic's players, have come to believe in themselves,
and the title which Rangers have owned for the last seven seasons is the only
prize they want.
It was not so very long ago when Celtic were little threat to Rangers because
of the boardroom and managerial turmoil which undermined confidence on and off
the pitch, but, with finances more stable, a new ground still rising in the
East End of Glasgow, and a studious manager in Burns, the future holds great
promise.
Burns' ways, which are not much removed from the traditional Celtic ways, in
fact, are showing through and they are also too much for most of his team's
opponents.
Celtic move the ball with elegance and ease, and into their game has been
introduced a variety of speeds. When necessary, players like McStay and John
Collins slow down and seem to scan defences in front of them, working out ways
of cutting through, but, when the opposition is caught on the break, Celtic
shuttle the ball forward at high speed.
Usually, several players are involved and the attacks are given an attractive
fluency which tends to bemuse anyone trying to read their play. There is little
doubt now Celtic are playing the most intricate and appealing football in the
top division.
However, Rangers remain the side they will have to overcome if the title is to
be shown off again at Celtic Park and there is about the Ibrox side a greater
resilience. They have been restrained because of injuries and suspensions yet
they are still clear at the top of the premier division and, having become used
to first place, they will not relinquish that position easily which suggests
the second half of the season could be thrilling.
Celtic, too, are learning to cope with the loss of players and went to Easter
Road without John Hughes and Peter Grant, but the pattern was not disrupted.
``It is easier for players to slot into a team when that team is playing
well,'' said McStay, who had been doubtful because of a cold. ``I spent Friday
in bed and that was enough. I don't want to miss any games.''
His recovery and determination to play was disappointing for Brian McLaughlin,
who had been told by the manager on Friday night that he would be playing in
place of the captain, but, when the players arrived on Saturday, McStay was
waiting.
He later radiated good health and he performed with a grace and vision which
no-one else could match.
There were enjoyable displays also from Collins, Simon Donnelly, who is
relishing his role as a wide midfield player, Phil O'Donnell, and Jackie
McNamara. The full back scored the opening goal - his first for Celtic - in 11
minutes when he was perfectly placed to finish off a well-constructed move
involving Donnelly and Pierre van Hooydonk.
McNamara's surged into Hibs' box and, when Donnelly's chip-in arrived, he
volleyed the ball into the net. It was a splendid goal which incorporated
speed, touch, and awareness.
However, it should be said Hibs made it easier for Celtic to look good when a
moment of weakness reduced Alex Miller's side to 10. Only Darren Dods will know
why he wrestled O'Donnell to the ground in 17 minutes after Darren Jackson had
tackled Andreas Thom heavily, but the outcome was costly. Dods walked and
Jackson was cautioned.
Thom easily evaded Andy Millen on the left nine minutes later and squared the
ball for O'Donnell to score from close range and, even that early in the match,
everyone knew it was all over.
Celtic went in search of more goals, but the third came 12 minutes from the end
when van Hooydonk's powerful header beat Jim Leighton, who was foolish enough
to get himself booked for having spoken out of turn to the referee at the end
of the first half.
Poor defensive play allowed Celtic possession in 85 minutes and their new
signing, Morten Wieghorst, played a good ball through to van Hooydonk, who then
supplied Donnelly running free into Hibs' box. The youngster took the fourth
goal well.
``We were beaten by a better team,'' said Miller, understating the obvious.
``However, we faced an uphill struggle when Dods' inexperience left us a man
short.''
As for Burns, he said there is more to come from his players. ``I couldn't be
happier right now, but I feel the team will get better. The players are working
very hard every day and the attitude is spot on.''
Celtic have been returning for more work in the afternoons for several weeks
now and the players feel the benefit training hard in the mornings and then
dealing with passing and movement in the afternoon sessions.
``If you want to be good at anything you must work,'' McStay added.
Well said, sir.

SCOTLAND'S John Higgins completed a runaway 9-3 final victory over Ken Doherty
to take the #40,000 first prize at the German Open in Frankfurt last night.
Higgins also snatched the high break prize of #5,000 from his opponent with a
clearance of 139 in the penultimate frame of the week-long event.
The 20-year-old Scot, in second place on the provisional rankings, won the last
six frames and needed only 52 minutes to move from 5-3 to 9-3.
Doherty claimed the first frame of the final with a 105 break but - as well as
logging the 49th century of his career - Higgins recorded 97, 80, 70, 50
(twice) and 41 as he captured his fourth ranking tournament title since he
turned professional in 1991.
Higgins further continued Scotland's domination of world-ranking events - his
victory was the 11th for his country out of the last 14.
However, the world No 11 admitted later: ``Before I came here I didn't think I
was playing well enough to win the event.
``My own draw looked hard and the first match against Chris Small was not the
sort you look forward to.
``Somehow, I played nearer my best in the final.''
Higgins continued: ``At the start of the season I used to wake up in the
morning praying I wasn't a one-hit wonder. I think I have proven that. ``But I
won't be easing up. I realise that it's very easy to fall down the ladder if
you take liberties in this game.''
Doherty, who took away #22,500 from his first final for 13 months, said: ``I
can't be too disappointed but I wished I'd played better.
``I thought I had a great chance of winning, although on the day John played
very well. He even nicked my high break.''

THE SRU proposals for the domestic league structure next season call for
retention of the eight-team premiership divisions, the national leagues, and
the knock-out Cup competition, writes Derek Douglas.
There had been a possibility of setting in place a 10-team premiership
structure, but the SRU has decided that it would be wrong to change the current
set-up after just one season. They have not, though, ruled out the possibility
of 10-team divisions in season 1997-98.
Under the proposed set-up the inter-district championship would become a
casualty. Next season, the proposal is that the national leagues will be played
throughout as now, but the premiership will be split with games played
throughout September and into October.
From the second week in October through until November 23, European Cup ties
would be played, with a break for the incoming Australian tour.
The premiership would resume on November 30 and continue throughout December
and intermittently through January and most of February, with a scheduled
finish on February 22.
The Scottish Cup competition would reach a climax with the finals at
Murrayfield in May.

THE pictures on television suggest a city in crisis, but here in Paris the
World Cup draw will go ahead tomorrow, because suddenly it has become a matter
of national importance.
The honour of France is at stake and the country which gave the Jules Rimet
Trophy to the world of football is determined that this will be the biggest and
best competition ever.
Despite suggestions from FIFA last week that the draw might be postponed, the
organising committee for the 1998 World Cup stood firm and the draw will be
broadcast live to an even bigger audience than the Olympics reach.
There may be, at times, a frown on the face of this grande dame of world
capitals, and yet the attitude, the resilience perhaps, of the Parisians
changes that.
Yesterday, despite the transport strike which has crippled Paris, huge queues
formed outside the Grand Palais to see the Cezanne exhibition.
Meanwhile, the FIFA congress at the Louvre went ahead with just that hint of
style you would expect from the French. Which other country would place
football alongside its national treasures?
But, of course, the French realise that they will be playing host to the
biggest ever finals. More than 700 qualifying matches will be played to decide
which 30 countries will join France, as the hosts, and reigning champions
Brazil in the finals.
More than 170 countries will go into the draw tomorrow and FIFA general
secretary Sepp Blatter pointed out yesterday: ``We believe the 1998 World Cup
will attract an audience of 37 billion for the month-long competition.''
The French organising committee, who have appointed Michel Platini as their
joint president, have recognised the importance of staging the tournament
exactly 60 years after they previously did so.
Says Platini: ``This is the biggest organisational challenge in the history of
the World Cup.
``There will be 32 nations taking part in 64 games in 10 different venues
across the country.
``There are more games to be played than there were in the United States, or in
Italy. But we are prepared.
``We are sure that everything will be perfect when the matches begin in the
summer of 1998. Already a great deal of work has been done.
``The games will be played over a period of 33 days, from June 10 to July 12.
``Both the previous two World Cups were played in a 31-day period, but only 52
matches took place compared with the 64 which will take place in France.''
Already FIFA have decided on the format for the matches. The 32 teams will be
divided into eight groups of four, following which there will be further
groups, and then the games will go to straight knock-out.
Scotland, of course, having failed to reach the finals in the United States,
desperately want to be among the elite this time round. It will not be easy.
However, if Craig Brown wishes to look at the tortuous path which will face the
nations of Asia and Africa, he might find that his lot is not too difficult.
The Scots will look to qualify and Brown will come here hoping that his team,
with the addition of the young guns he has begun to blood, can repeat their
success of the European Championships.
Everything, Irwin Shaw once wrote, in Paris begins at a cafe table.
Well, he may have been right but it will be at a conference table in the Louvre
where Brown's future in the World Cup will be decided.
Brown will recognise the problems. He will be there, just a stone's throw from
the most famous Old Masters, but he will not want to meet their footballing
equivalent.
He will not wish to face the Da Vincis or the Rembrandts of the football world.
He will prefer to meet the lesser nations.
That way he can look forward to returning here, to Paris, or to any of the
other locations in 1998 and staking yet another claim for a team which has been
so often written off and yet has persistently proved so many of us wrong.
Brown will arrive today knowing that part of his fate has been determined. He
will be working out the permutations already.
But only tomorrow will he discover exactly the matches, and the countries,
which will stand between him and his ambition of taking Scotland to the World
Cup finals as well as the last stages of the European Championships.

THE number of Tory MPs choosing to stand down at the next election has risen to
49, with the announcement that Mr David Howell, the influential chairman of the
all-party foreign affairs committee, is to retire.
Mr Howell, 59, is MP for Guildford in Surrey, which he holds with a majority of
13,404. His seat is considered safe: Labour needs a 22% swing at the next
election to win it.
However, his departure is a blow for the Government, which has been steadily
haemorrhaging senior MPs as the election approaches. Ministers and party
managers are said to be increasingly concerned that the loss of a large number
of experienced parliamentarians could leave the Tories weakened in the Commons.
Whether in Government or Opposition, a party requires knowledgeable back
benchers to fill not just ministerial posts but also the standing and select
committees that ensure the passage of legislation through Parliament.
The Eton and Cambridge educated Mr Howell served as Energy and Transport
Secretary in the Thatcher administration, as an early proponent of
privatisation. Since 1987, he has chaired the Select Foreign Affairs Committee,
and the centrist One Nation Group of Tory MPs.
He joins a growing list of veteran Tories with relatively safe seats who have
opted to leave the Commons. Some, like former Minister George Walden
(Buckingham) have expressed open disillusionment with the way the Commons is
run.
Some have complained - usually in private - that the new Nolan guidelines on
parliamentary standards, forcing them to declare outside earnings from
consultancies, have driven them out.
Other senior Tories retiring at the next election include former Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd, Dumfries MP Sir Hector Monro and Kensington MP Dudley
Fishburn.

HOPES for a general decline in interest rates this week were dealt a blow
yester-     day when Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer played down the need
for a reduction in German rates, which    would be the signal for a       cut
in other European countries.
This gives further impetus to the opinion that the much hoped for cut in UK
base rates will be limited to a quarter point to 6.5%.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George will take
the decision at their meeting on Wednesday, which is considered the most
important since May, with the outcome expected to hinge on a raft of key data.
Mr George is known to oppose a cut at this stage, particularly given the
potentially inflationary implications of the Ford pay claim, an industry
benchmark deal which will not be settled until January. So a compromise
quarter-point cut to 6.5% is thought likely.
Mr Tietmeyer said that German rates were already low and not obstructing
economic growth.

``HORSE-TAXI, Madame? Only one left.''
``Donkey-taxi? Plenty donkey-taxis.''
The hall porter at the Seman Hotel couldn't have been more helpful, keeping
them all at bay until we made a decision.
This was Kashgar, in the autonomous region of Xinjiang, China's last outpost,
from Beijing a 5000-mile journey across the Gobi Desert and then the Desert of
the Taklimakan (which loosely translated means: the desert from which there is
no return).
In Kashgar there are no motorised taxis. The sloping, low-sided cart; the
larger, horse-drawn cart with a candy-stripe awning - the choice would have
been much the same at the turn of the century when Kashgar, East Turkestan, was
at the nerve-centre of the Great Game of espionage and counter-espionage
between Britain and Russia and the Seman Hotel was the Russian Consulate. Peter
Fleming dined there, and was relieved to be still alive after a banquet served
by waiters with pistols.
Today, the Muslim Uighurs live there, a volatile Turkish race of people,
cousins of the Uzbeks of Tashkent and Samarkand over the border. The Han
Chinese are few in Kashgar, but the Uighurs still have the privilege of the
``minority'' races, exemption from the one child per family law.
I left the horse-drawn cart to a large family of Uighurs and boarded the
sloping donkey-cart, holding tight. A local trainee tourist guide was with me.
As we jolted off, a youth on a Flying Pigeon - the Chinese equivalent of an old
Raleigh bicycle - swung into action behind us. For miles he tailed us through
twisting lanes until he finally gave up hope of exchanging his Chinese yuan for
dollars.
Our driver was an old man, wearing his one and only, all-year-round outfit, a
black overcoat with a floral lining, a fur-lined hat and high leather boots. It
was late summer and land-locked Kashgar is one of the hottest places on earth.
He was not impressed by the youth's tenacity.
``The old man he says,'' translated the guide, ``if he had dollars he would
save up to see Mecca. But these young men, he says, they lay up dollars to buy
Japanese motor bikes.''
We passed under a banner strung across the lane. To Get Rich is Glorious, was
the message.
``In Kashgar it is every young person's dream,'' said the guide. ``In the old
days, many riches came through Kashgar. You have read about the Silk Road?'' I
had. I knew that Kashgar had been the last oasis in China for the silk
merchants and the first for the vast mule and camel-trains which would spend
another couple of years on the journey, probably, before reaching the gates of
the Forbidden City with their load of gifts from foreign monarchs.
To the Chinese emperors, the Silk Road was never anything so vulgar as a
trading route. Tribute was the word they used, and it came in many forms. There
was animal tribute - a rhinoceros perhaps, a pair of ostriches (the Chinese
call them camel birds), one of the flying tiger-striped horses from Ferghana .
. . There was also human tribute - dwarfs, acrobats, all manner of tumblers and
jugglers; or the special favourites, the dancing girls of Samarkand delighting
guests by their twirling on globes of glass.
To Get Rich is Glorious. Their Imperial Majesties would have squirmed at the
very thought of it.
``Under our new Responsibility Scheme,'' the guide was explaining, ``even the
peasants have yuans to spare through selling their surplus and there is much to
buy at Kashgar free market. One of the best free markets in China, maybe. I
could show you, but I think you are not interested.''
Not really. We worked out how we would meet again and he slipped off the cart,
intent on catching up with all the latest gear imported from Hong Kong and
Pakistan. I paid off the driver and headed for the old bazaar.
In the maze of alleyways whole families worked together or munched kebabs at
stalls thick with smoke from the charcoal-fuelled grills. The ring of hammer on
anvil mingled with the tattoo of beaten brass being fashioned into dowry
trunks. Dusty, happy children were everywhere, taking me by the hand, reaching
up to touch my hair. Apprentices watched every move as the master craftsman put
the finishing touches to a Kashgar speciality, the Yengitza dagger, inlaid with
jewels and sheathed in decorated leather. A whetstone powered by a bicycle
wheel whirred at his elbow. A woman, colourfully dressed with short skirt and
high heels but fully veiled in brown chenille, brought him a bowl of green tea
and he whipped out a dagger of his own to cut the loaf of plaited, unleavened
bread.
A small boy in a brown suit and matching flat cap hopped on to a cardboard box
and started plonking fur hats on my head, one after the other.
``Fur of wolf you like? Fur of bear? You like best fur of leopard?''
``Probably wouldn't get past the customs,'' I remarked to my newly acquired
retinue of eager English-speakers. They follow you everywhere in China. ``A
good little businessman,'' beamed a young lady who had introduced herself as a
first-year student in English philology. She hadn't understood. ``This is the
modern Kashgar,'' she added with evident satisfaction.
But it was the old Kashgar she volunteered to show me around, first a walking
tour of the central Id Kah Square, a lively mixture of families and vendors,
outdoor barbers and head-shavers, street entertainers, scribes and chess
players and a passionate soap-box orator, a Uighur nationalist with what the
student called ``a complaint''.
At the Id Kah Mosque, a funeral was about to start. The all-male mourners were
arriving in packed lorries, standing room only, holding on to each other to
keep their balance.
The only other notable ancient monument in Kashgar is the many-coloured Abakh
Hoja Tomb in the style of the Taj Mahal, containing the remains of a Muslim
missionary and his 72 descendants. The city walls are long gone, pulled down
when the Communists came to power. The ancient residential streets remain,
lined with continuous 10ft high walls sheltering the spacious mud-brick
dwellings which have their own interior covered lanes. The whole area is always
swarming with young children and naked toddlers. Follow-the-foreigner is a
favourite game. Visitors are still a curiosity in Kashgar.
We hired a horse-drawn taxi for the return journey to the hotel, so we had time
to spare. ``Let's go the edge of the desert,'' I said. ``I can't go home
without a single photograph of a Kashgar camel.'' (Alas, I was to be half-way
home by Sunday when camels would be among the thunder of animals coming into
town for the weekly market.)
For half-an-hour we peered into the distance while the taxi driver slept. There
was nothing to see but sand upon sand. As I struggled to stay awake, visions
drifted into my mind of the vast walled caravanserai, of the trains of
hundreds, sometimes as many as a thousand camels winding to a stop. I imagined
I heard the mortified cries of the proud double-humped Bactrians forced to
their knees for dismounting; the silk merchants going east answering the
muezzin's call or circling the Buddha, praying to be delivered from the
laughing demons of the Taklimakan, the ``black hurricanes'' of stones and sand,
the brigands reputed to drink from their victims' skulls by night...
When it was almost dark, a string of camels came into sight. The driver woke
with a start and busied himself lighting his kerosene lamp. The horse twitched
as the camels passed close by, seeming to scrutinise us with their old,
double-lidded eyes. Then they swayed off into the distance followed by a
herdsman.
``Camels,'' exclaimed the young guide. ``From where do they come, I wonder.''
He scratched his head for inspiration before surmising that they might be
something to do with the new joint-venture camelhair factory; or could they be
someone's idea of a new tourist attraction?
The camels were still visible, silhouetted against a sand dune. Then night
fell, suddenly as it does in the desert.
``Not much profit in camels, you understand,'' the guide summed up the
situation. ``Yes, that's the trouble with camels in our new modern China.''
Thomas Cook Holidays in association with Voyages Jules Verne offer a 14-day
holiday, starting in Pakistan and entering China by the Karakoram Highway over
the Pamir Mountains. As well as Kashgar (four nights) the tour includes stays

AS the clamour for a tough line on knife thugs grew ever louder yesterday,
campaigners were able to point to the dramatic success of Operation Blade for
Strathclyde Police in Britain's biggest crackdown on knives.
The four-month campaign was launched in February 1993 when Chief Constable
Leslie Sharp warned knife users: ``Bin your deadly weapons - or be put away
yourselves.''
By the end of the operation, Mr Sharp said the results had ``surpassed even my
wildest dreams''.
Operation Blade had led to a 139% fall in knife attacks, a 50% drop in
attempted murders in Glasgow, and an overall crime decrease of 19%. A knives
amnesty brought in 4569 weapons.
The four-month campaign started with a one-month amnesty. Special secure bins
were put in place in selected police stations in Strathclyde for people to dump
dangerous knives. Unless the knives had been used in a crime, police did not
want to know the identity of anyone depositing them.
After the amnesty, the campaign had five distinct phases:
q Phase two, which began on March 1, was a major three-month crackdown against
criminals carrying knives and other offensive weapons.
q Phase three involved police meeting disco and pub owners and advising them on
security measures.
q Phase four targeted shopkeepers. Police wanted to encourage discretion in the
sale of knives, especially to teenagers. Local police identified shopkeepers in
their area and invited them to seminars.
q Phase five targeted schoolchildren with community involvement officers
visiting schools to talk about the dangers of carrying offensive weapons.
q Phase six involved police and education officials co-operating to make a
video on knives, to be shown in schools and youth clubs.
Throughout, police had the support of procurators-fiscal and the Crown Office
for the crackdown. Mr Sharp also urged parents to play their part by finding
out where their children were going. He said: ``I would urge parents to start
communicating and ask the questions. That doesn't seem to me oppressive. That
seems part of the duty of being a parent.''

TO John Cunningham, employment turnover is like a pond: at the top are endless
ripples of activity where people change jobs, get promoted or even leave their
salaried positions to start their own business.
At the bottom of the pond lies the still, unchanging waters where the long-term
unemployed often stagnate without ever reaching the surface.
``What we're trying to do is take a stick and stir this up,'' said Mr
Cunningham, who serves as the director of training development for Lanarkshire
Development Agency.
The LDA's ``customised training'' programmes assist Lanarkshire's long-term
unemployed by providing workers with the skills needed to fill specific
positions at designated companies.
``It is a matter of us saying to the companies: `You define for us the
competency level this person needs to achieve,'.'' Mr Cunningham said. ``If it
seems reasonable, then we set up an agreement.''
For the past three months, 18-year-old Steven Gallagher has been working for
Wishaw-based glazing contractor J.&amp;.S McFadyen at the company's Carluke plant.
He came to McFadyen through the LDA scheme after spending two years drifting
between temporary work and the dole.
Mr Gallagher said that he liked the way the programme was run because before
training at McFadyen, he knew very little about PVC or how to make windows. He
has now been through every step of the process, from cutting material for the
frames to fitting glass into the finished product.
``It is a good programme - it is good getting folk off the dole,'' he said.
Mr Gallagher said he thought other people from Carluke could benefit from the
LDA scheme.
Since the programme evolved about two years ago, 606 of the 9300 long-term
unemployed in Lanarkshire have signed up for customised training. More than
three quarters of them now have permanent jobs.
``It is very cost-effective,'' Mr Cunningham said. ``We get far better results
from this than we do through the traditional training methods.''
About 5% of the LDA's annual #4.7m training budget is spent on the customised
programmes. These account for 21% of all its successful job placements.
J.&amp;.S McFadyen is one of more than 30 businesses that have hired people this
year through the LDA programme. Since the company opened its Carluke plant in
August, it has taken on 13 trainees through the long-term unemployment scheme.
Eight of them have been hired full-time and four others are nearing the end of
their six-week training period.
J.&amp;.S McFadyen found out about the customised training programme while working
with the LDA on another project.
Although it considered using a couple of other training and employmemt schemes,
the LDA offered the only programme that was practical and flexible enough for
the company.
``We haven't really had any (trainees) that aren't satisfactory,'' said Donald
Davidson, who supervises the trainees at Carluke. ``Most people coming to us
out of the employment office don't have the skills necessary to do this kind of
work, so the programme seems to have worked quite well.''
Production manager David Hamilton joined McFadyen himself through the LDA
scheme.
He spent a year out of work after receiving a university degree in
manufacturing before hearing that McFadyen was interested in hiring long-term
unemployed people.
Like Steven Gallagher, Mr Hamilton, 23, said the LDA programme could benefit
many other unemployed people throughout Lanarkshire.
``It is a good hope for them,'' he said. ``There are a lot of prospects for
them through this.''
Once a business is committed to the plan, the business and the LDA determines
how much training will be necessary and how large the new employer's training
subsidy will be. The courses last anywhere from two to 26 weeks, depending on
the type of work involved.
Businesses select their trainees - all of whom have been unemployed for at
least six months - from applicants referred by the local job centre.
The employer gets a subsidy of #35 to #50 per week per trainee. The sum usually
represents half the cost of training a new worker.
The LDA pays a bonus of up to #1000 for each trainee that is taken on
permanently.
Although local companies and new start-ups provide a lot of the training
opportunities, inward investors have also given customised training a boost.
Mr Cunningham said Chunghwa Picture Tubes' recent decision to build a #260m
factory near Mossend would provide a massive window of opportunity for the
long-term unemployed in Lanarkshire.
``Of course it's all in the very early stages right now, and we still have a
lot of things to discuss with Chunghwa,'' he said, ``but I would be
disappointed if a fair amount of their new employees didn't come through this
route.''

A LECTURE by the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is set to cost Lothian
region more than #25,000.
Mr Tom Aitchison, chief executive, said yesterday that councillors would be
asked this week to back a recommendation to settle a dispute over the costs of
the lecture in Edinburgh two years ago.
The group which organised the deal sent a bill for #50,000 for the two-hour
talk.
Mr Aitchison said that the group, the First Artist Corporation, had submitted a
claim which was disputed by the council.
``The matter was then clearly going to be referred to the courts. Our legal
officers' recommendation to the councils is to settle for a figure of about
#26,000,'' said Mr Aitchison.
It is understood the council did not draw up a contract in advance which would
have stated the fee for the talk by the former Russian leader at the McEwan
Hall, Edinburgh.

LABOUR'S plans for devolution would result in Scotland missing out on vital
input to the policy decisions of important Government departments such as
Social Security, a leading Scottish Tory has claimed.
Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, Minister of State for Social Security at the
Scottish Office, warned that Labour's ``expensive and bureaucratic parliament''
would threaten the existence of the United Kingdom and would be a ``costly
talking shop'' whose members would have absolutely no say over social security
matters which could only be decided at Westminster.
Addressing members of Greenock and Inverclyde Conservative and Unionist
Association at the weekend, Lord MacKay, Minister of the biggest spending
Government department, said Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's ``brand of
real devolution'' would involve Scottish MPs meeting in Scotland with key
Ministers such as Peter Lilley to debate and discuss the impact of social
security on Scots.
Lord MacKay said: ``We are working with other Government departments to create
a climate which encourages unemployed people into jobs or training.
``We work particularly closely with the Department of Industry at Whitehall and
the Scottish Office. This co-operation would cease to exist if these
departments were split between the two governments which Labour is proposing
for Scotland.''
Lord MacKay added: ``Michael Forsyth has introduced real devolution which will
directly involve Scotland in the decision making process of the Westminster
Government. Labour's devolution scheme would see Scotland miss out on vital
input to the policy decisions of important British Government departments.``
n Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine yesterday attacked Mr Tony Blair's
``spin doctors''.
He implied a reported feud between Tory chairman Brian Mawhinney and the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Mackay, amounted to black propaganda by Labour, and warned
that his party was ready to fight fire with fire.
``The Conservative Party, not the Government, is now preparing itself for the
techniques that we are going to have to fight, because we have watched the way
in which (Labour spin doctors) Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson are now
handling and distorting the news in this country.''
n PEOPLE who see Labour as the ``saviours'' of the National Health Service are
likely to be disappointed, according to a report by party sympathisers.
Labour has made no promises to keep threatened hospitals open or to provide
extra resources, and NHS rationing will be an issue under any government, says
a paper produced by the Fabian Society.
In a blunt assessment of Labour's policies on the health service, the document
warns the party will end up making ``unpopular'' decisions on the NHS if it
gets into government.

ONCE upon a time, when football managers and players could all do the job they
were supposed to do, there was a Celtic manager named Jock Stein, who had under
his wing a brilliant player named Jimmy Johnstone.
Now, this little story also involves a referee, but, like modern referees, he
didn't do his job very well (reference, recent Rangers v Aberdeen at Ibrox) so
we don't really need remember his name.
The scene was many years ago on a cold winter's Saturday at Parkhead where the
mighty Celtic were facing the formality of despatching lowly Queen's Park from
the Scottish Cup. William Hill quoted the amateurs at 5000-1 against to win the
cup and I had to write to London to get my #1 stake confirmed.
It was with anticipation and excitement that I arrived early enough to get a
seat in the rather small and inadequate Parkhead stand of that time. I was
quite happy to have the time wiled away by the Jungle choir who were still on a
high from a European Cup victory the previous Wednesday evening.
The choristers redoubled their efforts when Sean Connery appeared to pose for
photographers with the Bhoys, the crescendo continued until 30 seconds after
kick-off and then, complete silence - Queen's scored thanks to an own goal from
Tommy Gemmell (sorry, Tam, had you forgotten about it?)
Sad to say, my #5000 disappeared with the final whistle as Celtic ran out 5-3
victors in a cracking game which was somewhat marred by an incident one minute
from time.
There was a clash between Jimmy Johnstone, of Celtic, and Miller Hay, of
Queen's Park, which resulted in Johnstone committing, shall we say, a serious
indiscretion.
The referee was being encouraged by a few brave (for brave read dare-devil)
Queen's supporters to dismiss the said Jimmy Johnstone from the field but, for
reasons known only to the referee, Johnstone received no more than a
finger-wagging.
Amid a typical Parkhead party atmosphere, the final whistle blew and Celtic
marched on to the latter stages of the Cup.
However, all was not over, Jock Stein made a bustling run on to the park
whereupon he unceremoniously man-handled Johnstone off the park and up the
tunnel. We all know exactly what prompted this action and even Celtic
supporters nodded sagely.
Within a day or two, the press reported Celtic had fined Johnstone #200 and put
him in the ``sin-bin'' for a couple of weeks.
Believe me, #200 was a substantial fine in those days, wasn't it, Jimmy?
Stein would never have bothered to threaten TV evidence, Stein was never in awe
of his players, Stein was arguably the best manager at club or international
level Scotland has ever seen and he was respected by one and all.
Why can't present-day managers show the fans how they feel about the blatant
misbehaviour of their would-be superstars? I need not list examples, these have
all been well documented recently. Has managerial silence to be interpreted to
mean that they condone their players' ill-tempered behaviour and foul tactics?
Don't tell me that today's rewards are greater and players are of more
importance to their clubs. That is rubbish, everything is relative to the era.
Who would suggest that there are players around today who are any better, or
more important to their club, than Jimmy Johnstone was to Celtic in his heyday?
Managers have got to toughen up and be seen to be the boss. Discipline is
strictly their responsibility and the fans and young footballers of the future
have to know who is in charge.
PS. In fairness to Roy Aitken, I have to say he did not read this before he
disciplined Stewart McKimmie.

THE recent interview by Ken Gallacher with Billy Williamson and the
recollections of the famous Rangers v Moscow Dynamo game in 1945 brought back a
lot of memories for me.
I attended the match as I was on leave from the Fleet Air Arm at the time and
my father had managed to secure one of the hard-to-come-by tickets.
There were 90,000 at that match on a Wednesday afternoon so there must have
been a lot of grannies' funerals that day to allow so many workers time off.
The Rangers players turned out in their change strip of narrow blue and white
hoops as the Russians played in blue jerseys and blue shorts with a white hoop
near the edge, a fashion now adopted by some of our clubs including Rangers.
I, too, have that newspaper cutting held by Billy Williamson in my scrapbook.
It was written by former Rangers player David Meiklejohn and it was an
excellent report.
Over the years I have attended most of the big internationals at Hampden and
was privileged as a boy to be taken by my father to the Scotland v England game
in the ``new'' Hampden in April, 1937 when 149,547 were there. 150,000 tickets
were sold and so great was the demand they probably could have sold twice as
many. This remains a British record to this day.
Today they refer to a ``big crowd'' as more than 40,000 in the all-seated
stadiums but while this may give more comfort, the thrill of standing in a
packed ground like Hampden or Ibrox with all the excitement and noise will
never return.
I once went to a Scottish Cup semi-final non-ticket game at Hampden and 143,000
turned up. Those were the real fitba' days.

PRINCE Naseem Hamed is being lined up for a major fight against the great
Ghanaian Azumah Nelson next year. Nelson, 37, is negotiating a three-fight deal
with promoter Frank Warren who is confident it will culminate in a Nelson-Hamed
``mega-clash'' in September.
Nelson was out of the ring for a year-and-a-half before making a sensational
comeback by beating Mexican-American Gabriel Ruelas in five rounds to land the
WBC super-featherweight title 10 days ago.
It would mean WBC featherweight champion Hamed moving up to his fifth division
after winning titles at bantam and super-bantam (European and WBC
international), but Warren says this will be no problem for the Sheffield
showman.
Nelson, the former WBC featherweight king, has made two previous visits to
Britain, knocking out Midlander Pat Cowdell with a spectacular first round
punch in 1985 and halting Londoner Jim McDonnell in 1989.
Warren said: ``What we are trying to do is put together super fights for Naseem
Hamed in his campaign to win world titles at different weights. Nelson and
Hamed is probably one of the biggest matches in world boxing.
``People know Nelson over here from the Cowdell and McDonnell fights, and what
he did against Ruelas was a tremendous win. Ruelas is a quality fighter and
Nelson beat him in style. He's know as `The Professor' in boxing and he took
Ruelas back to school.''
Hamed makes the first defence of his WBO title against the Mexican Arnulfo
Castillo at the London Arena on February 10.
q DON King, the richest promoter in boxing, has secured 1000 free nights in
hotel rooms for Mike Tyson, his staff, and various entourages preparing for
Saturday's Tyson-Buster Mathis Jr fight.
But King, who is used to complimentary treatment at fights scheduled in casino
cities banking on the fights to bring in high rollers, wants more. The boxing
promoter is also seeking relief from state and local government taxes in return
for bringing the fight to the city.
``He has asked if the tax burden can be alleviated. In certain cases, he's
negotiating to pay less,'' said George Bochetto, chairman of the Pennsylvania
State Athletic Commission.

Aberdeen 1, Motherwell 0
HE emerged from Pittodrie, acknowledged the cheers of the waiting supporters,
then patiently signed autographs. Alex McLeish was still a hero in Aberdeen no
matter what has happened to Motherwell.
Yet, the adulation in no way obscured his sense of purpose to strengthen a side
whose 1-0 defeat had left it isolated at the foot of the premier division.
McLeish will today address the problems brought about by a bleak run of nine
games without victory by intensifying his search for a striker.
``The priority is to find a goal scorer as soon as possible,'' he said. ``Tommy
Coyne will not be available in the forseeable future and a replacement must be
brought in. We cannot go on missing chances and expect to get results.
``There is a very fine line between success and failure in this game. Right
now, we cannot take advantage of any opportunities and are paying the price
just as we did again at Aberdeen.
``The players are becoming increasingly frustrated at not being rewarded for
their efforts.
``My job is to ensure their heads don't go down and thankfully they are still
in the right frame of mind for the challenge ahead.
``However, if this run continues then there is the possibility that confidence
will be eroded.
``I must be seen to be doing something about the problem to keep faith with our
supporters.
``We have cast the net far and wide in recent weeks for new players.
``There is not a lot of money available but hopefully a new striker will be in
place soon.''
Striker Duncan Shearer finished off the game's most fluent move in 57 minutes
with a typical match-winner.
Motherwell's most experienced player Brian Martin is certain his side will soon
rediscover their true form.
``We are badly missing Coyne as there are not many quality finishers like him
around,'' he explained. ``You start out knowing he is guaranteed to get a
certain amount of goals.
``That is reflected in someone like Shearer and the job he does for Aberdeen.
He only had one chance and stuck it away, just like Coyne.
``We were capable of getting a result at Pittodrie but it was the same old
story. We defended well but could not take our chances when we were on top.
Pressure is piling up because of that failing.
``But the lads up front -Doug Arnott and Alex Burns -are working hard and
creating openings. The position would be much worse if we were losing and never
looking like scoring.
``That has to be important in the long run. The goals must start going in at
some stage. If we had beaten Aberdeen we would have only been three points
behind them instead of nine.
``However, it only takes two or three wins to climb right up this league and we
are confident we can do just that. We will get it right.''
There was sympathy within Pittodrie for the plight of their former leader and
Eoin Jess maintained that McLeish will turn Motherwell around.
``I know exactly what he is going through. We were down there last season,'' he
said.'' But if Motherwell keep playing like they did here they will escape just
as we were able to.
``While we were not at our best we were able to dig in and get a result and it
was only right that we won. Motherwell must do the same.''
q.CELTIC'S Brian O'Neil has been given the green-light from doctors to make a
Christmas comeback.
The defender has been given the all-clear to resume full training with the rest
of the squad today.
O'Neil has not played since injury forced him out of the Parkhead club's
Scottish Cup success against Airdrie last May, but he is ready to put the last
seven months of agony behind him and help Celtic keep up their challenge to
Rangers for the premier division championship.
He said: ``I was told on Thursday that I was ready to join the rest of the lads
again and I hope to be fit in time for Christmas.
``The last seven months have been very frustrating but Tommy Burns has been
great with me.''
O'Neil's return will further increase the competition for defensive places at
Parkhead.
Burns added Morten Wieghorst to his squad last week and he will join regulars
Tom Boyd and John Hughes as well as Malcolm MacKay in the battle for the two
central defensive places.

THE son of murdered headmaster Philip Lawrence wrote to Santa Claus asking for
his father back for Christmas, it emerged last night as police said they had
made progress in the hunt for the killers.
Eight-year-old Lucien Lawrence wrote the Christmas letter shortly after his
father's death on Friday. It was issued yesterday by Mr Lawrence's widow,
Frances.
His words summed up the grief and anger being expressed by pupils, parents,
teachers, and politicians at the senseless killing.
Mr Lawrence, 48, a father of four, of Ealing, west London, died on Friday night
after going to the aid of a pupil being threatened by a gang. He died of a
single stab wound to the chest.
He was attacked outside St George's Roman Catholic Church in Maida Vale, west
London, as he tried to prevent a 13-year-old boy being attacked by the teenage
gang.
In his letter, which Lucien asked his sister Unity to post to Santa, he wrote:
``Dear Father Christmas, I hope you are well and not too cold.
``I hope you won't think I am being a nuisance but I have changed my mind as to
what I want for Christmas.
``I wanted to have a telescope but I now want to have my Daddy back because
without my Daddy to help I will not be able to see the stars anyway.
``I am the only boy in the family now but I am not very big and I need my Daddy
to help me stop my Mummy and sisters from crying.
``Love from Lucien Lawrence, age eight.''
The poignant message came as pressure mounted for harsher sentences and tougher
laws to outlaw the offence of possessing a knife in public.
Teachers leaders will meet Education Secretary Gillian Shephard today to
discuss school discipline and teachers' powers to deal with disruptive pupils.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers,
said teachers might have to think twice about ``playing the hero'' in the wake
of the murder.
Relatives and friends of Mr Lawrence yesterday joined his widow and her son and
three daughters at a Mass which was said in their home.
The 15 relatives and friends arrived at the house, in Ealing, west London, for
the Mass, which was said by Fr Michael Hopley, of the Lawrences' local Roman
Catholic church, Ealing Abbey.
Fr Hopley said: ``All we can do at the present time is for the church and
friends and neighbours to rally round with Frances and with the children.
They're all shattered.''
The board of governors held a three-hour meeting in the presbytery of the
Sacred Heart Church, Kilburn. It took place as hundreds of worshippers filed in
and out of the adjoining church. Many stood at the back during the four
services. A fifth Mass was held at 7pm.
The Abbot of Ealing, Laurence Soper, and the Ealing North MP Harry Greenway,
have launched a nationwide fund for Mr Lawrence's family.
Cardinal Basil Hume, Archbishop of Westminster, said the murder suggested
society had lost the sense of sanctity of life.
``I think what has happened, this murder, has shaken people and sometimes we
need to be shaken to say, `My goodness, if this can happen in our
society, let's have a look at ourselves and see what we can do about it'.''
Speaking on BBC Radio 4, he said: ``Here was a headmaster doing his job and
helping one of his pupils and he was cynically and cruelly stabbed.''
Mrs Lawrence, speaking through friends, said she would not be making a
statement but earlier she and Lucien went into the garden of their home to cut
holly for Christmas decorations.
The officer leading the murder hunt, Detective Superintendent Brian Edwards,
said he had received a great deal of co-operation from parents and pupils.
``This has enabled us to make considerable progress in piecing together the
events and circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Philip Lawrence,'' he
said.
He said witnesses had given conflicting versions of events and said:
``Speculation does not assist the process of distinguishing truth from rumour.''
His comments came after allegations that the thugs involved in the attack were
members of a street gang with Triad connections.
Teachers and pupils will hold a Mass at the school today.
It is thought that the Mass will be attended by Cardinal Hume and Mr Lawrence's
widow.
Children at the school will attend a ``special programme'' for the day, acting
headmaster Andrew Graham said.
However, he insisted the school would be operating as normal from tomorrow as a
tribute to Mr Lawrence.

<HEADLINE>New protest at low flying</HEADLINE>

SOUTH of Scotland MPs are stepping up their campaign against low flying, after
a record numbers of complaints from the public.
Labour MP George Foulkes said yesterday: ``It is absolutely outrageous that the
noise nuisance and potential danger from the skies in the south of Scotland are
even greater than they were at the height of the Cold War.''
Mr Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, said the Ministry of
Defence should release detailed figures for each training area.
``All we are working on is the number of complaints,'' he said. ``But we
suspect that, if the numbers were released, they would confirm our suspicion
that the actual number of sorties has gone up a bit more.''
Mr Foulkes intends to submit a memorandum to the MoD, using written answers to
parliamentary questions to show that complaints for the first 10 months of 1995
are already 29% higher than the total for the whole of last year.
q On current trends, he claims, the number of complaints from the South of
Scotland will be 900 - 50% up on the previous record in 1994.
q Figures for the whole of Scotland for this year will be likely to exceed the
previous all-time record of 1491 complaints logged in 1989.
Mr Foulkes suggested: ``The first thing is that there should be a review of the
whole amount of low flying. Secondly, we are pressing very strongly for more
low flying to be undertaken overseas.
``We have opened our skies to a lot of extra low flying because Germany - under
pressure from the Greens and local conservation and noise abatement groups in
Germany - have stopped low flying in their country. It is absolutely ridiculous
that Germany is protected from low flying while we are taking on even more.
``We are suggesting that there are countries willing to take more.''
He added: ``Thirdly, we believe that more training can be done on simulators.
Just because pilots like the seat-of-their-pants experience and think that
simulators are for cissies does not justify the nuisance caused,'' Mr Foulkes
said.
Liberal Democrat MP Archy Kirkwood said last night from his home in Ettrick
Bridge, Selkirkshire: ``I think that the Government just does not understand
the depth of feeling that exists in the areas which are suffering
disproportionate shares of over-flying.''
The Roxburgh and Berwickshire MP added: ``Now that they are indulging in more
night flying, that is causing new levels of heartache. So we are going to keep
up the pressure.''

HOPES are building up that retail sales will move ahead smartly after months of
little or no growth.
The figures for November are due to be announced on Wednesday as the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the Bank of England,
Eddie George, meet to decide interest rates.
Bullish surveys from the British Retail Consortium and the Confederation of
British Industry have combined with better sales figures from John Lewis and a
strong set of M0 numbers to encourage expectations of an upturn in retail trade.
Adam Cole, UK economist at City stockbrokers James Capel, has revised up his
forecast to a 0.8% increase for last month from his earlier   estimate of
0.5%. On the higher figure the annual growth rate in retail sales would pick
up from 0.1% in October to 0.9%.
It is always a risky business to second guess monetary authorities, especially
when responsibility is split, as in the UK. City opinion has been moving away
from a cut in rates being imminent to the possibility of it being deferred
until January or February.
There are stronger hopes that the Bundesbank may cut its key rates on Thursday,
but there would be no great surprise if the German central bank again
disappointed expectations.
Coinciding with the retail sales figures will be the latest labour market
statistics. The trend of recent months would suggest a fall of around 10,000 in
seasonally adjusted unemployment last month. Capel is also forecasting that
average earnings growth in October was unchanged at 3.25%.
No nasty shocks are foreseen in the week's two sets of inflation statistics.
Today's producer prices may provide further evidence of factory prices peaking.
The core measure has already done so. The broad measurte of factory gate price
inflation is expected to rise        by 0.2% last month, which would allow the
annual rate to retreat from 4.6% in October to 4.5%.
Input price inflation is now falling back from the double-figure levels seen
earlier in the year when the full impact of higher commodity prices and a weak
pound was impinging on manufacturers' costs.
Cole is forecasting a rise of just 0.1% in November's retail price index, due
on Thursday. This would leave headline inflation unchanged at 3.2% and
underlying inflation, also unchanged, at 2.9%, but the new RPIY rate would edge
up from 2.4% to 2.5%.
TODAY - Producer prices (November).
TOMORROW - None announced.
WEDNESDAY - Retail sales (November); labour market statistics (November).
THURSDAY - Retail price index (November).
FRIDAY - None announced.

WINTER came to Scotland later than usual this year. It formally announced its
arrival late one evening in mid-November, when a policeman closed snowgates on
a mountain road a few miles north of Balmoral.
The road which disappeared for almost two days under a blanket of snow is known
locally as ``the Lecht''. It is known more widely, and more infamously, as the
A939 Cock Bridge to Tomintoul. Its closure last month, in accordance with a
tradition going back generations, signalled the onset of winter more assuredly
than the appearance of the first robin.
It is a ritual surrender to stormy weather that has earned the nine-mile
stretch of road a place in Scottish folklore, and inspired a legion of corny
jokes. The Herald diary recently noted that two members of the Strathclyde
police force were known as Cock Bridge and Tomintoul, because people often
encountered difficulty getting through to them.
Local residents are accustomed to such humour, and shrug their shoulders
philosophically. They insist that ill-informed reports over the years have
exaggerated the difficulties of crossing the Lecht. It's not as bad as people
make out, they say, and it's a lot better than it used to be.
Well, maybe. Negotiating the road on a rainy day in late November, one wonders
how it is ever open when the blizzards come. The hazardous stretch begins
shortly after crossing a stone bridge across the River Don, at this point
little more than a broad burn, which is the main feature of Cock Bridge. There
is a hotel, a manor house among some trees, and a couple of cottages and not
much else.
The road seems to climb vertically through a pine forest, before emerging on to
a high ridge surrounded by dark mountains. It is exposed to strong winds
whipping over bleak moorland, and at this time of the year the predominant
colours are black and various shades of grey. Everything is sombre, and seems
to be getting darker by the minute.
A noticeboard in a lay-by informs travellers that they are following the route
of an old military road from Coupar Angus to Fort George, constructed around
1752. One also learns that the granite hills on either side abound with red
grouse and other game birds, such as partridge, ptarmigan and curlew. What they
do not abound with is human life. Locals say: ``It's like another world up
there,'' and they are right. It could be Saturn.
Still the road climbs, straight up the shoulder of a mountain to a pass where a
straggle of low wooden buildings materialise as the Lecht ski station. In the
deepening gloom, they look from a distance like a miners' camp in the Klondyke.
For an instant the Cairngorms become the Badlands, and one expects to see a
sign pointing to Boot Hill.
There are no cheery cafes, however, let alone rip-roaring saloons, because
there is no snow, which means there are no skiers, which means the place is
shut. Saltire and Union flags flying outside the main building are ragged and
torn, from snapping in gale-force winds. The pass is at an altitude of over
2000 feet, and ghostly fingers of mist are creeping down the mountains. Within
minutes they have enveloped everything in sight, reducing visibility to a few
yards.
Descending the marginally less precipitous slope on the other side, one is
struck by the continuing absence of human dwellings, until the road reaches the
glen in which Tomintoul lies a couple of miles on. There one is greeted with
the remark: ``A good day for comin' ower the Lecht, eh?'' Everything is
relative in this part of the world.
The only people who actually live on the Lecht are James McIntosh, a director
of the ski centre, and his wife and three children. Mr McIntosh used to be a
helicopter engineer in the Fleet Air Arm, and a competitive skier, which may
explain his adventurous spirit.
Conditions on the road have improved markedly since he and a former helicopter
pilot established the ski centre 19 years ago. ``We knew there was going to be
a roads problem,'' he admits. ``So we struck a deal with the county council
that they would supply us with a snowplough and we would operate it.'' The
result, to the astonishment of local residents, was that the road was kept open
for much of the winter.
``The road is our lifeline,'' Mr McIntosh says. ``We need the snow, of course,
but if there's no access there's no money coming in. We just have to keep it
open as much as possible.''
Thus, he and his men liaise with workers of Gordon and Moray district councils,
who patrol the road regularly and come to the rescue with snow-clearing
equipment when necessary. There are times, however, when they are overwhelmed
by blizzards and forced to retreat. Twice last winter severe storms forced the
evacuation of the ski centre to the wailing of sirens in the hills.
The police, in consultation with the ski centre, now often close the snowgates
at night for safety reasons and reopen them the following morning. Apart from
saving lives, this allows Mr McIntosh an undisturbed sleep: ``I'm happier if
the gates are closed in bad weather, it means we don't have people getting
trapped and coming knocking on our door at all hours.''
This is all still a source of wonder to the locals, who are accustomed to
seeing the road effectively closed from November until Easter. Above the
counter of his grocer's shop in Tomintoul, Mr Ian Birnie displays black and
white photographs of his delivery van dwarfed by massive banks of snow after a
storm in 1963.
In that year, he recalls, he came to a house buried by snow on the braes of
Glenlivet and shouted down the chimney: ``Baker.'' Back came the reply: ``Ah
cannae get oot.'' It was three days before neighbours could rescue the occupant.
``The Lecht, years ago, they never used to bother wae it in the winter,'' Mr
Birnie affirms. ``Ye could forget aboot it a' the gither. But the weather's a
lot milder noo, we dinna get the bad storms like we used to.''
Having said that, he had to go over the pass in a four-wheel drive vehicle a
couple of years ago to collect his wife, who was unable to drive up from the
Cock Bridge side. ``It was a wild night,'' he remembers. ``When ye got oot the
car the wind fair took yer breath away. The worst of it was, I couldnae get
back up the hill masel'.''
They finally got home by taking a 60-mile detour via Dufftown. Mr Birnie
concludes: ``The Lecht's no' tae be tampered with, that's my honest opinion.''
It is a familiar refrain in Tomintoul, a planned village of traditional stone
cottages established by Alexander, the Fourth Duke of Gordon, in 1776. It still
earns its basic living from tilling and distilling, although tourists en route
from Balmoral to Inverness provide a welcome seasonal boost.
Mrs Isabella Gordon, age 90, knows about the Lecht. Her late husband, Jock,
worked on it for years, in the days when snowploughs were just lorries with
scoops in the front. ``There's no snow now like there used to be,'' she says.
``I've known Jock clear a bit before his breakfast, and when he went back oot
again it was a' filled in.''
Mrs Gordon remembers one freak storm in particular, when her husband was called
out to help get a bus down the Lecht by putting travel rugs under its wheels.
This was in June. Those were the years in which winter blizzards could be
relied on to dump enough snow on Tomintoul to allow children to slide off the
rooftops and swing on telegraph wires.
On the other side of the pass, Mrs Zilla Tuck has similar childhood memories.
As one of four daughters of the Laird of Allargue, she had the run of a
6000-acre estate on the southern incline of the Lecht above Cock Bridge. The
best time was winter, when the road was closed and covered with snow: ``It took
us ages to get to the top, and only three minutes to come down,'' she says.
``It was the best ski run I've ever been on.'' This was after she and her
sisters had sledged down to the farm to pick up the day's milk, of course.
Mrs Tuck also has photographs attesting to the severity of weather conditions
in the area. One taken 20 years ago shows her car completely buried by snow -
in mid-April. But the Lecht, she agrees, is no longer the impassable winter
barrier it once was. Having acceded to the lairdship, she is now more concerned
about a shortage of grouse on her moors.
Down by the banks of the Don, sheep farmer Willie Gray regards the dark hills
around the Lecht with grudging respect. ``It's a dangerous bugger of a place,''
he says. ``Ye can go up on a fine day and 20 minutes later ye cannae get doon
again.''
Mr Gray brings his sheep down from the hills from November to May, but he still
loses a few in unseasonal cold snaps every year. In his barn is a long stick
that he uses to probe snowdrifts for buried sheep. ``It's in the spring when
the lambs are little that ye get nailed,'' he says. ``Sometimes it's a cluggy
kind o' snaw that sticks tae the wool and the lambs cannae tuck under tae sook
frae their mithers. There's aye a few dinna make it tae the summer.''
Motorists approaching the Lecht, and wishing an up-to-the-minute weather
forecast, might learn something from Mr Gray's flock. He says his sheep can
sense the approach of a severe storm two to three days in advance: ``If I see
them coming doon the hill, or acting in a peculiar manner, I can say we're
going tae get something.''
But still, everybody insists, it's not as bad as it used to be. Mr McIntosh is
keen to point out that, even when the Cock Bridge section is closed, his ski
station is often accessible from the Tomintoul side. The villagers say that,
contrary to popular belief, it is extremely rare for them to be completely cut
off. And Bob Coutts, who has been working on the road for Moray district
council for 25 years, says: ``The storms are nothing like as bad as they used
to be. I'm quite glad, because I'm too old to be pushing cars half the day.''
The infamous road may now be open more often than not, but in Tomintoul a
gloomy fatalism about winter weather persists.
``Fine day,'' a visitor remarked during a recent sunny spell.
``Aye, but it'll no' last,'' came the reply.

HEARTS and Scotland striker John Robertson, whose stunning second-half strike
against Raith Rovers at Stark's Park on Saturday gave the Tynecastle side a
share of the points, has launched a scathing attack on match referee Mike
Pocock, of Aberdeen.
He almost certainly will land himself in trouble with the SFA.
There was little doubt about the mood among the Hearts players following the
premier division match in Fife - they were fuming after having seen central
defender Neil Berry sent off in the first half, then captain Gary Locke being
red carded in the later stages of the match.
There were also five bookings and areas of high controversy in a game where
both sides were desperate for victory following recent lapses.
The sendings off left Hearts to battle on with nine men, but there were other
complaints from the Edinburgh side.
They wanted to know why the referee sent Berry off in the first half and
awarded a penalty for a foul on Raith striker Steve Crawford, then, in a
similar incident shortly after half-time, he only booked Raith's new boy Mark
Humphries.
Then, after apparently awarding a penalty, he consulted his stand side linesman
and gave a free kick outside the box.
The fact that Robertson scored direct from the free kick obviously delighted
Hearts, but did not appease them for what they felt was shoddy treatment from
the officials.
There were mutterings and glares among the Hearts contingent in the corridors
of Stark's Park as they headed for home, but Robertson, a man of high
intelligence who is not prone to run off at the mouth, decided to speak out.
He said: ``It seems as if everybody has been preaching to the players for the
past month or so about how they must behave themselves on the field, and show a
more responsible attitude.
``Okay, I'll accept that. But, on the other hand, you must have more
consistency from referees.
``That's only fair to everybody, including the most important people, the fans.
``Out there today, there were two separate, but similar, incidents in the same
area of the pitch, yet the referee gave four different decisions - a red card
and a penalty against us, then a yellow card for the Raith player and a free
kick to us.
``Neil Berry thought his tackle was outside the box and I know that when I was
fouled by Mark Humphries, he was the last Raith player between myself and goal.
Yes, you could say we are angry.
``You don't need me to tell you that is inconsistency at the highest level. If
ever there was a case for players having cause to lose the rag, that was it.
``There wasn't a dirty tackle in the game, yet look at the crime count. I don't
know if I'll get into trouble with the SFA, but this had to be said.''
Hearts manager Jim Jefferies, who had heated words with referee Pocock as the
players left the field at the interval, also found it difficult to mute his
words after the match, but he did manage to do that.
``I've got to be careful in what I say,'' he remarked. ``But there is no way
I'll be fining Neil Berry or Gary Locke for being sent off.
``Neil tried to make a genuine tackle and the incident with Gary and Tony
Rougier was just a collision between two strong boys fighting for the ball.''
I can well understand Hearts frustration at the way the referee handled the two
incidents which led to both goals.
Robertson and company must have felt they were the victims, but we will never
know if their thinking was justified.
After all, Mike Pocock and his fellow referees are actively discouraged by the
SFA from explaining their actions.

<HEADLINE>Nuclear contract set to reroute north A Trident face-saver for Rosyth</HEADLINE>

Exclusive
THE Government is on the verge of announcing a politically embarrassing
compromise which could bring the key section of the #5000m Trident refit
contract back to Rosyth.
The move would also relegate the rival Devonport operation to minor repairs and
overhaul work.
The partial U-turn in policy, forecast exclusively by the Herald in April,
would involve the nuclear refuelling of the 16500-ton Vanguard-class missile
submarines in Scotland. All other modifications and upgrading would be carried
out at the Plymouth yard in a face-saving split of responsibilities.
The announcement of the plan is understood to be imminent. Devonport's
workforce, concerned about its future, was told last week it would come
``within 10 days''. Defence and industrial sources say it will probably come
just before Parliament breaks up for Christmas, on December 20, to minimise
political fallout.
The only other option under active consideration was to contract the work out
to the American yards which refuel the US Navy's Trident fleet. This would save
between #150m and #200m per boat, but would cost British jobs and leave the
UK's strategic deterrent to some degree at the mercy of US foreign policy. Both
would be politically damaging.
The Government's dilemma is that it is less than 18 months from a General
Election, and facing a major challenge from both Labour and Liberal Democrats
in the south-western constituencies.
It is also facing spiralling costs for the upgrading of the former battleship
berths earmarked by Devonport's management for work on Trident. Estimates for
an upgrade to this D154 complex which would meet the stringent standards set by
the independent Nuclear Installations' Inspectorate range from double to triple
the original #236m quote tendered in 1993.
The all-party Commons Defence Select Committee expressed its grave concern over
rising costs in July in a report which concluded that Devonport Management
Ltd's winning bid for the Trident work was ``based entirely on highly marginal
cost considerations''. The committee added that it would be ``particularly
disturbed by any escalation in the real price''.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo, the champion of free enterprise, has
already had to delay the complete privatisation of the Plymouth dockyard
because of the cost factor. His no-win options are to abandon privatisation or
fund the necessary improvements from a defence budget already under pressure
from Treasury cutbacks.
DML, the private consortium which manages the yard, has been trying to install
100ft solid rock anchors to provide stability for the Trident boats. The
problem is Devonport is built on a slate and limestone base: NII safety rules
call for a drydock capable of withstanding a small earthquake.
Rosyth, built on solid bedrock, already has a #120m, custom-built drydock known
as RD57, and has fitted seismic arrestor blocks - giant shock absorbers - as an
additional precaution.
When the nuclear refit contract was awarded to Plymouth in 1993 amid a huge
political outcry, the Defence Ministry announced that all nuclear-powered boats
would be handled there from 1997 onwards. That timetable has already slipped,
and Rosyth is now refitting two hunter-killer submarines.
Two others in refit at Devonport have taken longer than anticipated because of
problems with the NII regulations, leading to a slight overstretch in submarine
resources.
The first Trident boat, HMS Vanguard, is due for refit in the year 2000.
Defence unions are now concerned the Government has talked itself into a corner
which might cost the taxpayer and the Royal Navy dearly. Mr Jack Dromey,
national secretary of the Transport and General Workers and the leading
dockyard workers' negotiator, has called on the Commons Public Accounts
Committee and the National Audit Office to instigate a public inquiry into the
affair.

SCIENTISTS should refuse to help develop weapons of mass destruction, and blow
the whistle on any projects that pose a danger to mankind, Nobel Peace
prizewinner Joseph Rotblat said yesterday.
London-based Professor Rotblat, giving his lecture at the Nobel Prize awards
ceremony in Oslo's City Hall, also appealed to nuclear powers to dismantle all
atomic weapons within 10 years.
Professor Rotblat, who shared the #1m Nobel award with his anti-war Pugwash
group for his efforts to rid the world of the bomb, said scientists caricatured
as ``Dr Strangeloves'' had helped to fuel the nuclear arms race during the cold
war.
``They did great damage to the image of science,'' the 87-year-old physicist
said.
``If all scientists heeded this call, there would be no more new nuclear
warheads, no French scientists at Mururoa, no new chemical and biological
poisons,'' he said.
Announcing its choice in October, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said giving the
1995 award to Professor Rotblat was partly a political message to France to
stop its controversial nuclear tests in the Pacific.
Polish-born Professor Rotblat is often called the world's first anti-nuclear
protester. He worked on the atomic bomb to prevent a Nazi victory in the Second
World War but quit in 1944 after it became clear that Hitler would not be able
to build the new weapon and because he became convinced that it posed a threat
to mankind.
Professor Rotblat, a British citizen since 1946, is the last survivor of the
scientists who signed the Bertrand Russell-Albert Einstein manifesto against
the bomb in the 1950s.
Quoting from the manifesto, the white-haired laureate spoke with a frail voice:
``We appeal, as human beings, to human beings: Remember your humanity and
forget the rest. If you can do so, the way lies open for a new paradise; if you
cannot, there lies before you the risk of universal death.''

SPECULATION was mounting last night that the historic headquarters of Scotsman
Publications in Edinburgh is to be converted for retail and residential
purposes.
The Herald understands a model of the planned development has been constructed
and is on display in the offices of company chiefs.
The newspaper group which publishes the Scotsman and its sister newspapers, the
Evening News and Scotland on Sunday as well as the freesheet Herald and Post,
was sold off by its Canadian-based owners, Thomson, only weeks ago to Barclay
brothers for an estimated #90m.
The reclusive Barclays already own the European newspaper and the Ritz Hotel.
A Scotsman insider yesterday said: ``It appears they are considering using the
first four floors for retail development with flats above. It also looks as if
the basement, which used to house the printing presses, could be converted for
parking.''
Office premises in Dundas Street in the New Town are thought to be under
consideration by Scotsman executives as a new base, according to The Herald's
source.
The chairman of Edinburgh District Council's planning committee, Councillor
Robert Cairns, said last night such a proposal would be in line with city
centre development policies.
``Shopping would certainly be in line with the policy we are trying to build up
in the city centre, where we are trying to bring new attractions to compete
with out-of-town shopping. An element of short-stay and residential parking
would also be welcome,'' he said.
However, the Cockburn Association, a conservation pressure group, said it would
be unhappy to see the newspaper group leave its North Bridge home in the heart
of Edinburgh's Old Town.
Suggestions have been made for some time that the Scotsman headquarters were on
the move, with rumours that its prime-site North Bridge home would be converted
to a five-star hotel.
The company's newspapers have not been printed at North Bridge for five years
after final production was moved to Newhaven, near the foreshore of the Firth
of Forth.

A SCOTS town has been called the Christmas ``Scrooge'' capital of the world.
Town centre managers in Cumbernauld earned the title by scrapping a Christmas
grotto last week to save money.
At the weekend, they switched off the Christmas carols, played through the
public address system, to save the license fee.
Now shopkeepers and residents are angry about the cost-cutting measures which
have brought Christmas gloom to the new town.
Ms Margaret McHugh, of Scan Bookshop, said: ``The decision about Santa was bad
enough but this one about the carols and other piped music is disgusting.
``It's the final nail in the coffin of any shopkeeper trying to do business in
Cumbernauld. Imagine a town of 55,000 people and no Santa and now no Christmas
carols.''
Another shopkeeper, who asked not to be identified, said: ``This really is the
last straw.
``Every town centre in the world goes out of its way to attract people,
especially at Christmas.
``But the management running ours is hell bent on driving people away. It would
be laughable if it wasn't so serious.
``This will end in customers, especially with kids, going elsewhere and that
will lead to shops going bust.''

WITH Fort William's clash with Kingussie frozen off, the top of the premier
league remains unchanged with just one week to go to the winter break.
Inveraray, however, moved into joint third spot after drawing with Oban
Camanachd in a disappointing clash at Mossfield.
Dougie MacIntyre ended speculation that he was to sign for rivals Celtic by
turning out for Camanachd but only David Devine came close for last season's
south champions, hitting the woodwork.
At Drumnadrochit, Glenurquhart dominated their match with Newtonmore for long
spells before some slick finishing saw the Badenoch side depart with two points
and a flattering 4-1 scoreline. Jamie MacPherson gave Glen the lead, but 'More
sored twice in each half to move above Glen into fifth place.
In the south first division, Kyles dumped the Glasgow University students 7-1.
The north first division championship is altogether more competitive, with Skye
more or less putting the brakes on leaders Caberfeidh, who drew for the third
time.
Cabers had led from the fourth minute and squandered a chance to kill the game
when Calum Nicolson saved Lee Nicol's penalty. Skye hit back and Duncan
MacDougall equalised.
In the North Qualifying Cup, Glengarry won an extraordinary match against
Lochcarron at Battery Park 6-4. Under-21 internationalist Iain MacKenzie scored
all of the west coast side's goals. To his astonishment however, Steven Cameron
also scored four for the visitors who clinched victory with a James Barron
strike with six minutes left.

EVIDENCE now exists for the first time in the debate about the economics of
independence from both sides of the argument which confirms that Scots
contribute more than their fair share of tax, the SNP claimed yesterday.
The party's Treasury spokesman, Mr John Swinney, said Scottish Office figures
showed that Scotland contributed 9.3% of the UK's tax receipts in 1993-94,
compared with its 8.8% share of the population. This represented nearly #10 a
week extra for every taxpayer.
SNP figures also indicated that Scotland would pay 9.8% of the UK's revenue in
1995-96 - equivalent to #23 extra a week for every Scots taxpayer.
Mr Swinney, speaking after a meeting of the SNP's Cabinet during which the
party's campaign on the economics of independence was discussed, claimed that
business rates were higher in Scotland and that Scots paid more council tax
than for comparable homes of the same value in England.
The same pattern was evident in certain expenditure-based taxes such as spirits
and tobacco and within the local authority sector, including council rents, he
said.
Even excluding North Sea oil revenues - every penny of which Mr Swinney claimed
was taken by the Exchequer - Scottish Office figures still showed Scotland
paying more than its pro-rata share in UK taxation.
He argued that the Scottish Office had used ``extremely unsound assumptions''
in certain areas - notably income tax - but had failed to ``massage away'' the
fact that Scotland paid more than its fair share of tax.
Mr Swinney added: ``Scotland pays more than her way within the UK. With
Independence in Europe, the London levy can be made to work for the benefit of
Scotland.''

Paris
SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown will fly into Paris this afternoon with the
knowledge that he cannot be bracketed in a qualifying group with England when
the draw for the 1998 World Cup qualifying games takes place tomorrow afternoon.
That will be conducted in front of a massive world-wide TV audience at the
Louvre, but yesterday, the FIFA deliberations had worked out in advance just
how the countries will be drawn.
Or, rather, UEFA had imposed its will upon the world body.
The system eventually decided was the one proposed by the European officials,
whose president, Lennart Johanneson, will stand against FIFA's Joao Havelange
for the presidency of the world body in 1998.
What UEFA wanted - and what was agreed - was five groups of five teams, with
another four groups of six.
The nine group winners, and the best of all the runners-up will qualify
directly for the finals, while the other eight runners-up will be involved in
four home and away qualifying games, with the winners going through.
Scotland know that they cannot face the English, the Republic of Ireland, or
Switzerland, who edged them out of qualification for the finals last time round.
They will also avoid the powerful Bulgaria and Portugal, as well as the Czech
Republic, Belgium, and Greece.
The Scots have been placed in the second strata of teams along with these other
European countries. Above them, predictably, are Germany, Spain, Italy, the
Netherlands and Russia.
Less predictably, Norway and Sweden, who have not qualified for the European
finals, are also there along with Denmark and Romania.
Below the Scots, danger lurks when you realise that Croatia, one of the more
exciting teams in Europe, is in the third stream.
However, Brown and the SFA delegation will know exactly what faces them
tomorrow. There are always problems with arranging dates and these will be
exacerbated by the political situation in Europe - and even the Middle East,
because Israel are involved.
Apart from that, the matches must be completed by November 16, 1997, and then
the play-off games must take place, and be decided, within the next fortnight.
This would be a major headache for the Scots, but SFA chief executive Jim Farry
insisted: ``We are prepared for this. We knew the possible scenario, and we
have been looking at the situation for some time.
``We know that FIFA are pushing for international matches to take place at
weekends. That is something we have been suggesting for several years now.
``Obviously it will be up to the team manager how he wants to schedule the
various matches. But we will support him in anything which would involve
matches at the weekend. It seems to us that this would be of benefit to our
country.
``It is even possible that you can play `double headers,' either going to
Europe to play on a Wednesday and then a weekend, or even doing this at home.
We will talk to Craig Brown once we know the exact situation.''
Brown, however, has already intimated to me that the twin match situation would
suit us. It would allow him extra time for preparation with his players, and
would also cause the minimum of disruption to the league programme.
Brown and the SFA are aware of the value of matches being postponed to allow
the national side to go into matches without the worry of players collecting
injuries immediately prior to vital qualification games.
This suggestion, of weekend games, would cut down on the disruption of the
league programme.
It would also, as Brown knows, give a certain element of continuity to his
training programme, something which regularly has been missing from Scotland's
preparations down through the years.
Playing at the weekend will be a bonus. Once the draw is made, once the
opponents are known, then Brown and Farry can negotiate the dates they want.
If they do as well as they did for the just-finished European campaign, when
their last run of home games carried them to England, then France and '98
becomes a strong possibility.
World Cup Pools : SEEDING pools in the European section of tomorrow's
qualifying draw:
Pool A - Germany, Spain, Italy, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Sweden,
Romania.

IF video evidence can convict drivers and hooligans, then why should it not be
used to help police football?
I would make it a requirement of premier division membership that each club
installs at stand level a camera system that takes in the entire pitch for the
whole 90 minutes.
This would have the following advantages:
1. Incidents unseen or not properly seen by the referee and linesmen could be
replayed with any disciplinary action being levied by the football authorities.
In the same way as drivers react when they see a police camera in action sign,
if they knew that all their actions were being recorded then players would
follow the same psychological process.
Procurators-fiscal might then have sufficient confidence in a self-policing
system to avoid the ludicrous inconsistencies we are seeing at present.
2. Referee supervisors could man the cameras on match days and give
instantaneous rulings.
I can think of a Dundee United ``goal'' at Firhill in recent seasons and the
David Robertson offside incident in the recent Old Firm game when technology
could have prevented an injustice.
There will be those who say that officials' authority would be undermined but
the game is played at such a pace nowadays that I think referees and linesmen
need technology.
The use of video evidence seems to work in both cricket and American football.
On offside decisions, I remain to be convinced that a linesman is capable of
watching the last kicker of the ball while at precisely the same moment running
his eye along the last line of defence, which could be 30 or 40 yards away.
3. Videos of games where you can see the whole pitch would be useful to
managers and coaches.
Surely we could benefit from seeing how teams such as Juventus and Paris St
Germain move off the ball?
To see, for example, the movement of their strikers when their full backs have
the ball or the runs of their midfield men and defenders when the ball is
played to their strikers.
This cannot be done from a worm's eye view in the dug-out.
As a final point, now that the proactive role of referee supervisors has been
established can we expect to see the cancellation of red and yellow cards which
have been unjustly given? Somehow I doubt it.

AS a citizen, who pays his income tax dutifully, I derive no satisfaction from
seeing large amounts of police and procurator-fiscal time being charged to my
account wastefully.
I also resent the expense of accommodation at police stations or especially in
overcrowded jails of footballers who have been scrapping with each other all
afternoon merely because a camera has caught them going ``over the score''.
I agree that there has to be an appropriate police presence, paid for by the
host club, to ensure good public order, but I suggest that if similar incidents
occurred in the streets on a Saturday night in an area of camera surveillance
no policeman would consider it was worth taking time to refer the matter to the
procurator-fiscal. At Ibrox, there is segregation of visiting supporters from
host supporters and I would be very surprised if the police noticed any
reportable offences as a result of any of the recent incidents.
If there is good public order despite the on-field incidents I cannot see why
the police should want to use large parts of their budget for no real benefit
to the ratepayers, or the procurator have to bring a case at the taxpayer's
expense.
Perhaps you have figures which prove that the Ibrox incidents did disrupt
public order? In which case, I will be grateful if you would publish them.

Srinagar, Sunday
INDIAN officials believe Kashmiri kidnappers are still holding two Britons and
two other Westerners, despite reports that they could have been abandoned in
the Himalayan mountains.
``More than one hundred Al-Faran militants are still guarding four Westerners
in the forests of Kukernag in South Kashmir,'' said a senior police official.
``According to our sources, the number of Al-Faran militants guarding the
hostages is increasing.''
An Indian defence spokesman said yesterday that the military believed Al-Faran
had handed Paul Wells, 23, of Blackburn, Lancashire, and Keith Mangan, 33, from
Middlesbrough, Cleveland, and the others to local guerrillas, or had abandoned
them in the wild and freezing mountains.
He spoke after the interrogation of three guerrillas he said belonged to
Al-Faran. They were captured in a clash with Indian forces on Monday.
The Britons, plus American Donald Hutchings and German Dirk Hasert, were
kidnapped in south Kashmir last July while on a trekking expedition.
Another captive, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, was found decapitated in
August.
The defence spokesman agreed today that the information from the captured
guerrillas could have been wrong.
``They are hard-core militants and can change their statement any time, so we
cannot rule out that the hostages are still with Al-Faran.''
Al-Faran has demanded the release of 15 jailed guerrillas in exchange for the
captives, but India has refused. The kidnappers contact Indian authorities from
time to time to press their demands, but there have been no messages for two
weeks now.-Reuter.

ITSASONDO: Two Basque police officers were shot dead yesterday in the northern
Spanish province of Guipuzcoa. Regional officials said the attack could have
been carried out by the Basque separatist group Eta, but local police, who
arrested a 23-year-old local man, attributed it to a ``disturbed individual who
had a personal conflict with the agents''.

Los Angeles, Sunday
NASA scientists today received the first data from the space probe Galileo, a
message beamed over 2.3 billion miles that may give Earth its first close-up
look at the giant planet Jupiter, and how time began.
The radio message from Galileo, which travelled for six years before reaching
its current orbit around Jupiter, is expected to give scientists their first
measurements of the huge planet's atmosphere, composition, climate, and weather
patterns.
The data is being relayed by Galileo from its 746lb probe, which plunged into
Jupiter's swirling, gaseous mass on Thursday.
That trip, a suicide plunge into the heart of the giant of the solar system,
has been likened to a journey to the beginning of time because scientists
believe the information it has gathered could unlock the secrets of how the
solar system was formed.
While scientists were cheered by the successful reception of data, they will
not know the quality of the information until the Galileo team analyses it.
Earlier, team members cautioned that transmission would be on a ``best effort''
basis because the sun is currently between Earth and Jupiter and is likely to
cause radio interference.
Galileo's probe gathered its data as it hurtled through clouds of water,
helium, oxygen, and nitrogen and endured Jupiter's hurricane-like winds of
200mph and violent lightning storms.
The probe's communication with Galileo cut off after 75 minutes, after which
scientists say it was almost certainly crushed and vaporised by the extreme
pressure and high temperatures found in Jupiter's upper atmosphere.
The data transmission, which will consist of the first 43 minutes of the
75-minute transmission from the probe to its mother ship, will continue until
Wednesday.
It will be repeated twice more next month when Earth and Jupiter will no longer
be blocked by the sun. Transmission of the full 75 minutes will be completed in
February.
During the next two years, Galileo will make 11 orbits of the giant planet,
which is 318 times larger than Earth. The spacecraft will have close encounters
with three of Jupiter's largest moons, Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa, visiting
Ganymede four times and the others three times each. It will also photograph a
fourth moon, Io, from medium range on each orbit.
The mission is set to end on December 7, 1997, when Galileo will make its
farewell transmission before plunging into the Jovian atmosphere and burning
up.
It took the spacecraft six years and a journey of 2.3 billion miles to reach
Jupiter and planning for the #900m mission began in 1977.-Reuter.

GOLF ROUND-UP
LAURA Davies, of Great Britain, and Mardi Lunn, of Australia, lost by one hole
in the final of the Diners Club matches by the American holders Tammie Green
and Kelly Robbins at PGA West here in Palm Springs yesterday, writes John Ball.
But at least the Commonwealth pair had the satisfaction of being the first team
in three years to take the three-times champions to the final green. There
Davies, who had flirted with a lake in a desperate attempt to get close enough
to score the birdie that would have extended the final to extra holes, grazed
the cup with a 25-footer.
She and Lunn collected $50,000 each while the winners shared $250,000.
The Americans got off to a tremendous start winning the first three holes with
birdie, eagle, birdie. Two birdie putts from the Commonwealth girls at the
eighth and twelfth holes gave them a glimmer of hope, however, and when Lunn
knocked in an eight-footer on the seventeenth, the champions were obliged to
take a look at the 390-yard last hole for the first time.
A half was good enough to win the only matchplay title left in the women's game
and produce a notable hat trick.
Davies said: ``It was also the first time I had ever played the last hole, and
it was a bit scary with all that water facing me.''
She added: ``If I had holed the putt I might have gone on to win the tournament
but missed the evening flight to London.'' Other results:
Regular Tour - T Lehman and D Waldorf beat K Perry and J Huston, 1 up; Senior
Tour - J Colbert and B Murphy beat D Stockton and H Irwin, 1 up.
q SCOTLAND'S John Chillas finished joint fourth in the Algarve Land of Golf
European Pro-Am finals in Portugal on Saturday, writes David Bryden.
The Glenbervie player carded a second round one-over-par 72 at Palmares which
left him four adrift of Antonio Sobrinho, of Portugal, whose 71 gave him a
winning aggregate of 146. The Scot had been unable to recover from a crippling
first-round 78 at Vila Sol which included an 8 at the par-4 second.
In the team event, which featured 21 qualifiers from six countries, Chillas and
amateur partners Peter Brown (12) and John Leonard (6) finished in a creditable
tenth place on 151 Stableford points. Hilton Park's Billy McCondichie, Martin
Connolloy (10) and John Heath (5) were 10 points further behind. Leading scores:
146 - Antonio Sobrinho (Portugal) 75, 71.
147 - German Garrido (Spain) 74, 73.
149 - Manuel Vargas (Spain) 75, 74.
150 - John Chillas 78, 72; Paul Wesselingh (England) 78, 72
q AUSTRALIAN Peter O'Malley carded a two-over-par 72 yesterday but still
completed a three-stroke victory yesterday in the $325,000 New Zealand Open in
Auckland. American Scott Hoch surged over the final round with a four-under-par
68 to finish second on 275. Leading scores:
272 - P O'Malley (Australia) 65, 67, 68.
275 - S Hoch (USA) 71, 69, 67, 68.
276 - F Nobilo (New Zealand) 70, 69, 66, 71; T Price (Australia) 69, 69, 66, 72.
Other scores included: 279 - C Parry (Australia) 68, 68, 70, 73. 289 - B
Jackson (England) 71, 68, 73, 77. 292 - A Cejka (Germany) 70, 72, 72, 78.
q FRANKIE Minoza, of the Philippines, shot a two-under-par 69 in strong winds
yesterday and went on to win the Daikyo Open, the Japan PGA's season-ending
event, by two shots.
Starting the final round with the one-shot lead over American Brian Watts,
Minoza played a see-saw game with six birdies against four bogeys for the
11-under-par 273 total.
Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, the 1995 Japan PGA tour's leading money winner with
$1.92m did not enter this tournament.
q AMERICAN Clay Devers closed with a 73 to win the first Vietnam Open by one
hot yesterday. Leading scores:
275 - C Devers (USA) 66, 66, 70, 73.
276 - B Ruangkit (Thailand) 69, 66, 69, 72.
277 - C Liang-hsi (Taiwan) 72, 71, 69, 65.
279 - C Espinosa (Mexico) 72, 69, 68, 70.

Paris, Sunday
FRENCH Prime Minister Alain Juppe last night gave in to demands to meet trade
union leaders for open-ended talks, not only on his controversial plans for
welfare reform, but also on other social concerns.
He did not budge, however, on the content of the reforms themselves, which the
unions, until last Friday, had wanted withdrawn altogether as a condition for
talks.
Union leaders, who met Labour Minister Jacques Barrot for the first time
yesterday after more than a fortnight of strikes, had demanded a meeting with
the premier.
``I am very attentive to all those who are suffering from this situation. We
must get out of it, through dialogue and consultation,'' said Mr Juppe.
``I am ready to meet each union organisation tomorrow.......it's a question of
getting round the table and finding a solution.''
Speaking on prime-time television tonight, Mr Juppe also gave in to demands by
CGT leader Louis Viannet and Marc Blondel, leader of Force Ouvriere, that no
limits be imposed on the subjects of talks.
However the Prime Minister went on to say that only the applications of his
reforms would be up for discussion.
He justified the content and the legitimacy of his reforms, underlining the
fact they had been voted through the National Assembly with a large majority.
The Prime Minister said he would push his measures on health service debt
through the National Assembly before Christmas, using decrees to avoid lengthy
debate. Decrees would again be used to short-circuit National Assembly
discussion on hospital reform.
Mr Juppe said that parliamentary control of welfare spending, instead of the
existing corporate system which relies heavily on union involvement, would be
maintained.
``Our country is democratic,'' he said.
He denied there would be any reduction in reimbursement of medical expenses and
suggested that the highly-sensitive subject of public sector pension schemes,
which involve fewer years of contributions than those in the private sector,
could be the subject of discussion with unions.
To accusations that he intended privatising some of France's public services,
Mr Juppe said he was ready to have a new clause written into the preamble of
the French Constitution to the effect that no-one had the right to dismantle
them.
An economic crisis was looming behind the social crisis in France, he warned.
The strikes have already destroyed the benefits of the plan he had presented
last month to help small firms, and strikes were destroying progress in the
fight against unemployment.
``I want France to be a serious-minded and happy country. We cannot live on
credit. We must reduce our deficits in order to be strong. We must stop the
violence and develop fraternity,'' he said.
France is in its third week of the most serious industrial unrest and the worst
social agitation since the 1968 riots which nearly unseated General de Gaulle.
Rail and public transport strikes, a postal stoppage, and huge demonstrations
in Paris and provincial towns were provoked by Mr Juppe's ambitious reforms to
the country's heavily indebted welfare system, national railways, and public
sector pension schemes.
The Prime Minister's interview last night came against a background of growing
political crisis. Yesterday he held an emergency meeting with nine Cabinet
Ministers most directly concerned with the strikes.
Unions will pile the pressure on this week with another day of demonstrations
throughout the country on Tuesday, when transport, postal, and energy workers
will be joined by prison officers, hospital staff, dockers, and bank employees.

q.SOMEONE had tried to sabotage a nuclear power station at Blaye, near
Bordeaux, by pouring salt into a water cooling pipe, the French state
electricity company EDF reported. Management added that the station's safety
was never endangered as it did not involve the reactor. The incident occurred
during a strike by staff in protest at European Union plans to open the
electricity sector to competition.

Glasgow 27, Scottish Exiles 28
THERE may just be something in this District championship business after all.
Glasgow, humiliated midweek by North and Midlands, bounced back yesterday at
Burnbrae to force a last-gasp rescue effort from the Exiles who were behind for
all but the last eight minutes.
Glasgow, fielding just the single international in Ian Jardine, led until the
seventy-fifth minute, the Exiles' five (ultimately six) Scottish caps being
largely shaded by a side which struggled in the scrummage but not much
elsewhere.
Even in the scrummage, young Chris Docherty and Gordon McIlwham, and that old
soldier John Gibson, head-to-head with an all-international front row - Hilton,
Scott and Burnell - laboured effectively to paper over the cracks until late on
when the pressure began to tell.
Glasgow coach Hugh Campbell observed later that the difference between this
performance and that eight-try defeat by North and Midlands had been one of
attitude. ``Ian Jardine coming back made a big difference and the back-row
blend was better too but the major difference was the attitue of the players. A
50-point thrashing tends to do that,'' he said.
The Glasgow back row was, indeed, superb. McVey, Sinclair, and Mackay were
ravenously hungry compared to their Exiles' counterparts, for whom only Eric
Peters, with some tackles that exuded real venom, was at the races.
Exiles' coach Al McHarg did not spare the rod afterwards. His side, he said,
had been guilty of making too many mistakes and unforced errors. ``We're not
talking here about the opposition putting us under pressure. We put ourselves
under pressure.''
With the exception of Peters, who played a game of aggressive defence and
snaffled ricochet ball at the lineout tail, only Derrick Patterson took much
from yesterday.
Starting scrum half Andy Nicol was stretchered off with a head knock after 52
minutes and when Patterson came on there was almost immediately more zip about
the Exiles.
Glasgow were 6-0 up within five minutes, Calum MacGregor kicking two penalty
goals and generally enjoying the kind of prowess with the boot which deserted
Exiles' goal-kicker Stuart Laing.
Cammy Little, who had a tidy game at scrum half, increased the Glasgow lead
with a try after 30 minutes and MacGregor converted. Laing eventually found the
range in the first half in injury time and speared home a 30-metre penalty
effort to make it 13-3 at the turn.
Murray Craig began the Exiles' fightback almost immediately with a try, chasing
Fraser's chip, and Laing cut the deficit to two points with a penalty goal four
minutes later.
Glasgow stretched the lead with an Iain Sinclair try, the scoring pass coming
from Little, after 51 minutes and as Nicol was stretchered off MacGregor put
over the conversion.
The Exiles came back again with a Gavin Thompson try after 67 minutes, the
Glasgow scrum creaking and a hand being used in the retreat. Patterson tapped
the penalty and Thompson scampered over.
Five minutes from the end, after another Patterson penalty tap, Aaron James
scored out in the corner and Laing added the conversion points.
The Exiles were in the lead for the first time and consolidated their position
with a try by Patterson following scrummage pick-up by Peters. Glasgow, though,
were not finished and a McIlwham try, following three penalty awards to the
home side, underlined their fighting spirit. MacGregor's conversion, which
coincided with the final whistle, took Glasgow to within that single,
tantalising point of victory.

(Stirling County), A Garry (Watsonians), G Hawkes (GHK); C MaGregor (Glasgow

Warsaw, Sunday
POLISH president-elect Aleksander Kwasniewski has survived a move to overturn
his victory over former Solidarity hero Lech Walesa, but a court ruling that he
misled voters over his education could damage his authority.
The Supreme Court ruled that the former communist turned social democrat had
broken electoral law by falsely claiming during his campaign that he held an
economics degree.
However it rejected an application backed by nearly 600,000 Walesa supporters
that Kwasniewski's narrow November 19 victory be annulled. It said it was
impossible to determine how Kwasniewski's claims had affected people's
preferences.
Kwasniewski, back from an 11-day holiday in Spain, tried to put the lie behind
him, saying that what counted most was Poland's future, which he wanted to
build along with all responsible political forces.
``What needed to be explained was explained.......It is time to end
compromising rows and shake hands,'' Kwasniewski told reporters. ``I propose to
my opponents that we begin discussions on what is ahead of us.''
He said he would present his programme on December 23, after the swearing-in
ceremony at a joint session of the two houses of Parliament.
However the court ruling was seen as mixed blessing for Kwasniewski even by his
closest allies.
``This is obviously not a comfortable situation,'' said Prime Minister Jozef
Oleksy, Kwasniewski's colleague in Poland's last communist government in 1989.
Stanislaw Gebethner, a leading constitutional lawyer, said: ``The case
certainly has a bad influence on Kwasniewski's image as a politician at the
onset of his presidency.''
During a sometimes bitter electoral campaign, the articulate and elegant
Kwasniewski presented himself as a pragmatic modern leader capable of uniting a
nation divided over the past.
He clearly convinced many sceptics that he, rather than Walesa, was the man to
lead Poland into the European Union and Nato.
Critics, led by Walesa, whose former Solidarity movement helped overthrow
communism in 1989, portrayed him as an opportunist who would promise anything
to achieve his goals.
Walesa, who today was visiting southern Poland where he got most votes, again
vowed to fight the ex-communists as a leader of a bloc that would unite the now
splintered right-wing groups.
Some analysts said the court ruling might help Walesa in this task as it set
the scene for attacks on the president and undermined his credibility.
``Many people may think that since Kwasniewski was dishonest about small
things, he may not be frank about bigger issues,'' said sociologist Halina
Franczak.-Reuter.

TRIPLE jumper Jonathan Edwards was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year
last night - after tipping boxer Frank Bruno, who came second, for the award.
Scot Colin McRae, the world rally drivers' champion, came third in the viewer's
opinion poll.
The Gateshead Harrier collected the award 24 hours after being named the
world's top male athlete in Monte Carlo.
``This has been an incredible year for me.'' he said.
The awards followed a season in which he won the world title, broke the world
record three times, and became the first man to break the 18-metre barrier.
A special award went to 60-year-old racing legend Lester Piggott, who retired
this autumn, 47 years after he rode his first winner.
The BBC Team of the Year prize went to the victorious Europe Ryder Cup golf
side, while New Zealand All Black rugby union giant Jonah Lomu, was voted top
overseas personality.

Sarajevo, Sunday
TONIGHT'S deadline set by France for the release of two pilots shot down by the
Bosnian Serbs passed with no word on their whereabouts, whether they were still
alive, or how Paris plans to retaliate.
The French Government has threatened ``multiple consequences'' and ``strikes''
against the captors and their political masters, but has insisted that
Thursday's signing of the Bosnia peace deal in Paris will go ahead whether or
not the pilots are returned.
Pressure mounted on President Jacques Chirac in France, however, to postpone
the signing ceremony on the deal agreed in Dayton, Ohio, last month if there is
no word on the pilots.
``It's out of the question to sign the Bosnia peace treaty when our husbands
have not been returned,'' said Isabelle Souvignet, wife of missing navigator
Jose Souvignet.
The newspaper Journal de Dimanche said it would be impossible for Chirac to
appear at the ceremony alongside a smiling Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, who negotatiated at Dayton on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs.
Chirac said he holds Milosevic responsible for the pilots after the Serbian
leader promised him he would find and return them.
Le Monde reported yesterday that details of the signing ceremony could be
affected by the non-return of the pilots. It also said France might seek to
reimpose sanctions on Belgrade, lifted after the Dayton deal was struck.
Belgrade has reacted angrily to the growing pressure from Paris, saying it had
done everything it could and had only limited influence over the Bosnian Serbs.
The two pilots were shot down during Nato air strikes against Bosnian Serb
targets in August. They were photographed alive with their captors, but Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has said they were later kidnapped from a hospital
by unknown forces.
There has been speculation that they are being held by Bosnian Serbs as a
bargaining card to have parts of the deal renegotiated and to prevent Karadzic
and army commander General Ratko Mladic from being handed over to an
international war crimes tribunal.
Today, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said that, at the request of the
Bosnian Serb leadership, he had called on the UN tribunal in The Hague, which
has indicted the two, to suspend the proceedings against them.
As the stand-off cast a shadow over the peace deal, preparations for deploying
a 60,000-strong Nato force to implement the Dayton accord were gathering pace.
A first group of soldiers and policemen who will protect the headquarters of
the force left for Sarajevo today.
The 46-member advance team included Italian Carabinieri paramilitary police,
some 20 US Marines, and US Army and Air Force security police.
The first two trains carrying US troops from bases in Germany to join the force
travelled across Slovakia today, and more trains were expected over the next
days.
In Bosnia, the Muslim-led government army opened its arsenals to public
inspection today at a mass parade that displayed both the strengths and
weaknesses of the country's fighting force.
While crowds cheered the 10,000 soldiers who mustered to march through the
central Bosnian town of Zenica, the army showed it still has not the armoured
strength to outgun the Bosnian Serbs should it go back to war.
US Vice-President Al Gore said Washington had concluded that achieving military
balance in Bosnia would require arming and training Muslim forces.
Republican politicians who are opposed to sending 20,000 US troops to the peace
force are pressing for guarantees that Bosnian government forces will be armed
and equipped, seeing this as the best insurance against the Americans becoming
bogged down in Bosnia.-Reuter.

OFFICIALS from two separate watchdog bodies are expected to arrive in the
Highlands today to launch an investigation into a charity dealing with problem
teenagers.
A further probe will be launched during the week by social work officials into
the Inverness-based charity, the Nansen Society.
The inquiries follow the resignation of three of the group's trustees over the
contents of a letter written by its director.
In the letter, director Danny Schepens talks sexually about a seven-year-old
girl, describes his alcoholism, and mentions a friend of his called ``Adrian'',
who has been sexually abusing children.
It was written in 1991, when Mr Schepens was working alongside Adrian Batty,
and three years before Batty was jailed for abusing children in his care at a
school in Rosemarkie, Ross-shire.
Mr Schepens, 33, wrote the letter to Mr Lyndon Stephens, a former colleague at
the establishment which caters for troubled school-age children near Inverness.
Mr Stephens, who now lives in Australia, said: ``I was very concerned about the
contents of the letter.''
He added: ``Apart from the letter, he also told me about the time he feigned
madness to get out of doing National Service in Belgium. I did not feel he was
safe to be left in charge of young people.''
This week, an inquiry will be launched into Mr Schepens's suitability to head
the charity, which organises outdoor adventure training for disadvantaged and
problem teenagers.
Highland region's social work registration committee meets on Thursday, at
which the issue of Mr Schepens's suitability as the leader of a charity to
which it refers teenagers will be raised.
The Nansen Society is named after Norwegian Arctic explorer Fridtjof Nansen
(1861-1930), a Nobel Peace prizewinner, who also served as his country's
ambassador to Britain during Edwardian times.
Two of the three who have resigned are Mr David Dean, the founder of Raddery
School, and local farmer Hector Munro, of Foulis, in Easter Ross.
Mr Dean has asked the English-based charities commissioner to investigate the
society, while the Scottish Charities Office, which is part of the
Edinburgh-based Crown Office, is launching its own investigation this week.

<TEXT>
SOUTH of Scotland MPs are stepping up their campaign against low flying, after
a record numbers of complaints from the public.
Labour MP George Foulkes, who intends to submit a memorandum to the Ministry of
Defence, said yesterday: ``It is absolutely outrageous that the noise nuisance
and potential danger from the skies in the south of Scotland are even greater
than they were at the height of the Cold War.''
Mr Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, said: ``There should be a
review of the whole amount of low flying.
``Secondly, we are pressing very strongly for more low flying to be undertaken
overseas.
``Thirdly, we believe that more training can be done on simulators.''
Mr Archy Kirkwood, Liberal Democrat MP for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, said:
``Now that they are indulging in more night flying, that is causing new levels
of heartache. So we are going to keep up the pressure.''

SHADOW Consumer Minister Nigel Griffiths yesterday called for an inquiry into
the registration of approved gas workers following a spate of near-fatal
accidents involving carbon monoxide poisoning.
The Edinburgh South MP said there had been many deaths and casualties despite
inspections by approved Corgi-registered workers. He warned that numbers could
rise during colder weather.
Mr Griffiths highlighted a number of recent cases, including a man taken to
hospital, he said, after a Corgi-approved fitter had failed to detect a faulty
boiler in his rented flat.
He said: ``The Corgi system is letting people down. It only registers the
business, not the individual fitters.
``Safety is being neglected and yet the Government is going ahead with
competition for the domestic gas market before independent fitters have an
adequate registration system. The Government can't leave it to chance or
incompetent fitters.''
The MP said he would be pressing the Government for improvements in the
registration system.
Mr Griffiths produced a detailed list of eight deaths from carbon monoxide
poisoning in November caused by faulty appliances, including a 79-year-old
Welsh pensioner and a 19-year-old student.
He produced a further list of ``near-misses'' for the same month, where 37
people had been affected by leaking carbon monoxide from gas appliances.
The casualties included Brian and Lily Kelly and their three children, of
Hillhead, in Glasgow. The family were overcome by the invisible and odourless
carbon monoxide, as a result of a blocked chimney.
The MP is chairman of the safety pressure group Co-Gas, which aims to reduce
the number of deaths from invisible carbon monoxide gas leaking from appliances.
The group today will publish a five-point survival plan for gas and solid fuel
users.
Ms Stephanie Trotter of Co-Gas said it was ``shocking'' that a charity had to
publish such information and warnings and backed the call for changes in
registration of workers. ``Safety must come first,'' he said.

<TEXT>
Geneva, Sunday
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he was ``quite positive'' after
talks with Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz that problems between the
world body and Baghdad could be solved.
However after the meeting, neither made any reference to the United Nations
embargo on Iraq over its 1990 invasion of Kuwait or the possibility of partial
oil sales by Baghdad.
``I am quite positive. By definition, I am an optimist. I hope we will be able
to solve issues between Iraq and the United Nations,'' Boutros-Ghali said.
UN officials had said today's meeting in Geneva would focus on an offer by the
world body to allow Iraq to sell $2bn (#1300m) worth of oil to buy humanitarian
supplies badly needed by ordinary Iraqis.
However neither mentioned the issue to reporters and declined to answer
questions.
Aziz said he had briefed the UN chief on what he called ``the hard work that
has been done by the Iraqi authorities in the last few months to clarify most
of the issues raised in late August after the defections''.
He was referring to the flight to Jordan of two sons-in-law of President Saddam
Hussein, one of whom alleged that Iraq had a much larger weapons programme than
had been suspected by the outside world.
Aziz said he was travelling to New York tomorrow to have more talks with Rolf
Ekeus, the UN official overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
Ekeus is due to deliver a report to the UN Security Council on December 15. The
report has been given added interest by the discovery of sophisticated missile
parts in Amman which Jordan says were being smuggled to Baghdad.
Aid agencies say food and medicines are desperately needed in Iraq. They say
starvation is taking hold in some areas and hospitals have few medical supplies
left.
Before the UN ban on oil exports can be lifted, however, officials must certify
that Iraq's banned weapons - nuclear, ballistic, chemical, and biological -
have been destroyed.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Search for a cure to rid the Killearn site of decaying eyesore</HEADLINE>

THERE was a recent celebration for the 25th anniversary of the transfer of the
Institute of Neurological Sciences from the former Killearn Hospital in
Stirlingshire to Southern General Hospital, Glasgow.
However, while the institute now looks forward to the refurbishment of its
25-year-old building, the future of its former site, the 55-acre Killearn
Hospital, closed in 1972, remains uncertain.
Located on the main A81 Glasgow to Aberfoyle road within the Stirling
constituency of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, it is in a state of decay.
Only the former hospital manager's house has been renovated and extended and
two cottages have been partly built. Two former health board houses have also
been renovated and sold on to private buyers.
One entrance to the former hospital remains accessible. The other is blocked by
steel girders.
People in the village of Killearn have described the former hospital, one of
several erected during the Second World War as part of the Government's
emergency building programme, as a ``dreadful eyesore''.
Some claim it has become a habitual dumping ground and allege that considerable
quantities of asbestos, used mostly in pumping stations attached to the former
wards, have also been deposited in the grounds.
Sources estimate the Scottish Home and Health Department bill for guarding the
dilapidated ward complex between 1972 and 1985 ran to almost #1m.
The SHHD is understood to have turned down about a dozen bids for the site,
including one in 1979 for a #500,000 holiday and leisure development.
The Government department is thought to have accepted verbally a bid by the
late Sir Hugh Fraser who wanted to build a curling rink, other leisure
facilities, and luxury housing.
However, the site was withdrawn from the market before any deal was completed
after a disclosure that a 1000-acre former hospital site at Robroyston, near
Glasgow, had been bought by a developer for #410,000 and sold with approval for
housing some two years later for more than #2m. It led to the then Scottish
Secretary tightening procedures concerning such land sales after an inquiry.
In 1985, the SHHD is understood to have accepted an offer of about #80,000 from
Selborne Developments Ltd, said to have been run by a group of Glasgow
businessmen.
Planning permission was granted over the years for several projects, including
an equestrian centre and associated craft industries and two private nursing
homes, but the company failed to follow through its interest, blaming the lack
of public sector financial support and the recession.
Forth Valley Enterprise declared its interest recently in buying two acres of
the site on behalf of Stirling Rural Initiative to create four small workshops
and a handful of local jobs.
However, The Herald understands this plan too could be in some doubt.
Inquiries at Companies House in Edinburgh have established that Selborne
Developments, which still owns the former hospital site, was dissolved last
month.
Stirling Sheriff Court has confirmed that Mr Graeme Sword, who was listed as a
company director, and lives on the former Killearn hospital site with his wife
and two sons was sequestrated, declared bankrupt, in November, last year.
Two other companies, Selborne Construction Ltd and Selborne Research Ltd in
which Mr Sword was also involved, were dissolved last September.
A Companies House official explained, however, that Selborne Developments could
continue trading as a business even though it had been dissolved as a company.
Legal experts with Forth Valley Enterprise, which is near to completing
missives for the purchase of the two-acre site, have privately expressed
surprise at learning of the predicament of Selborne Developments and Mr Sword.
A spokesman for the local enterprise company said: ``We are dealing with
Stirling and Gilmour, a firm of solicitors based in Alexandria, which is acting
for Selborne Developments Ltd.''
Solicitor Derek Robertson, who acts for Selborne Developments, told The Herald
that Mr Sword's sequestration would not affect the future development of the
site. He said Selborne Developments ``always has been the owner of the Killearn
site and would continue to be so''.
Mr Robertston said Mr Sword was not now a director and denied that he was the
main player in the company, although he would not disclose who was.
Mr Sword was not available for comment.
A Selborne Developments spokesman said he ``remained optimistic'' that projects
may ``start to happen'' given Forth Valley Enterprise's stated intentions. He
said at least two parties had expressed new interest in developing a private
nursing home and added that an associated private housing development was also
under consideration.

<HEADLINE>Food producer wants Lanark Blue costs inquiry</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974946470</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Scottish Tory plans to call in local government auditors to
investigate the hundreds of thousands of pounds in public money spent in
prosecuting the Lanark Blue cheese case.
Food producer Arthur Bell said he would reveal details today of his plans for
an investigation into Labour-controlled Clydesdale District Council.
The council was criticised by a sheriff at Lanark Sheriff Court last week for
its handling of the Lanark Blue cheese case. Sheriff John Douglas Allan refused
to allow it to destroy 44 batches of last year's cheese, which he said was
perfectly safe. The Lanark-based council was unrepentant last week and said it
had pursued the case simply on the grounds of worries over public health.
Mr Bell said he was ``over the moon'' that cheesemaker Humphrey Errington had
beaten the council, which wanted to destroy the produce because it contained a
type of the food bug, listeria monocytogenes.
However, it is the alleged misuse of council money which has alarmed Mr Bell
most of all. He intends to call on Government departments and Ministers to
investigate Clydesdale.
Mr Bell, chairman of the Scottish Tory Reform Group and a Government adviser on
small businesses, declined yesterday to reveal details of his plans.
Already Mr Errington has said that local government auditors should be called
in to investigate the amount of money Clydesdale spent in pursuing him through
the courts.
He is seeking legal advice about suing Clydesdale for #120,000 - his share of
the Lanark Sheriff Court case. If he were succesful, it would bring
Clydesdale's legal bill for the year-long saga to close on #350,000.
Yesterday, Mr Bell said, referring to the case: ``There has been a serious
misuse of public power here. Who do these people (Clydesdale) think they are?
They have been beaten four times by the courts and still it appears they are
saying the courts have got it wrong. I can't say yet exactly what my plans are
but, believe me, I want to see some action in what I regard as a terrible waste
of public money.''
Mr Bell himself ran up against the council after it demanded to know where he
got a piece of cheese which he ate on TV to demonstrate that it was safe. He
said he was threatened with prosecution by Clydesdale if he did not reveal
where he had obtained the slice of alleged Lanark Blue which had been seized by
the council.
Lawyers acting for Mr Errington are drafting an official complaint to the local
authority ombudsman, alleging serious misconduct by Clydesdale's environmental
health officers.
The lawyers - Morton, Fraser, Milligan of Edinburgh - have lodged an official
complaint to Sheriff Allan over the BBC TV programme, Reporting Scotland, which
broke the sheriff's embargo on the release of his ruling.

<HEADLINE>Ospreys may be bred at reservoir English water firm hopes for birds of prey at man-made lake</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH BUIE</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974946473</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN ENGLISH water company is trying to reintroduce the osprey, one of Britain's
rarest birds of prey, to breed at a man-made lake in Leicestershire by using
chicks from osprey nests in Scotland.
Anglian Water is hoping to receive the consent of the Government's statutory
conservation agencies, including Scottish Natural Heritage, to embark on a
five-year breeding programme at its Rutland Water reservoir next summer.
A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Mr Mike Everett,
said the organisation was taking a neutral stance on the proposal. A pair of
ospreys could quite easily nest at Rutland Water - which is on the birds'
migration route between Scotland and their winter destination of West Africa -
next year voluntarily.
``There is nothing to stop a pair of ospreys nesting there at any time. Ospreys
pass though this area on migration all the time. It is not right to suggest
that naturally, it could take 200 years - it could equally take one year. This
is a great unknown,'' he said.
However, Mr Roy Dennis, who is advising Anglian Water on the project and is an
acknowledged expert on the osprey, said from his home near the most famous
osprey nesting site at the RSPB Loch Garten reserve: ``Ospreys do not like
nesting where there are not other ospreys, so they keep coming back up here.
``This is a way of enhancing the spread of these birds. If we left them, they
would eventually come to England. But it could take 50 or 100 years, or just
10.''
The last recorded breeding pair in England were seen in Somerset in 1842 and
the species died out in Scotland in 1915, victims of trophy hunters and egg
collectors. In 1954, a pair returned to nest in Scotland, probably by accident,
according to Mr Dennis.
The Scottish population has now reached almost 100 breeding pairs and is spread
from Sutherland to near Glasgow.
Under Anglian Water's proposal, bird experts would identify pairs which had
failed to nurture three chicks born in previous years, either because there was
insufficient food or because the parent birds were too lazy.
Using techniques employed for the reintroduction of red kites and sea-eagles to
Britain, one of the osprey chicks might be hand-reared, or extra fish
introduced to the nest, before that chick was removed and taken to Rutland
Water to start a new population there. After migration, they apparently know to
return to the place where they were released, rather than where they were born
and, within two to three years, Rutland Water would become their home.
Mr Dennis said the scheme was unlikely to have an adverse effect on the
Scottish population. ``There is no problem at all - there are plenty of young.
What is happening now in Scotland is that there are so many to a nest that
there is some evidence that they are delaying the time when they breed. They
would rather hang around waiting for a period to breed than build a new nest,''
he said.
Mr John McAngus, a spokesman for Anglian Water, said: ``Our proposal must not
in any way disturb or reduce the Scottish population. If we thought we would
affect that in any way, we would not go ahead.''
q The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has been accused of threatening
the future of the golden eagle.
Speyside farmers Stephen and Colin George, who are tenants of Pityoulish
Estate, near Aviemore, have accused the agency of slaughtering the red deer
population and banning sheep on the nearby Abernethy Forest Reserve, robbing
the bird of prey of its main source of food - deer and sheep carcasses.
The brothers claim that 1300 deer had been killed since 1989, both in and out
of season ``in the name of conservation''.
The RSPB denied the claim, saying the eagle feeds on hare and grouse as well,
and the species is thriving in the area despite the deer cull.
RSPB reserves manager for North Scotland, Mr Peter Mayhew, said the RSPB policy
of deer culling was aimed at allowing the natural regeneration of native
Caledonian pinewood and retaining manageable numbers of deer.
Our proposal must not in any way disturb or reduce the Scottish population. If
we thought we would affect that in any way, we would not go ahead

THE grim realities of youth homelessness will be explored at a conference in
Glasgow later today.
The event, On the Street, is organised by Glasgow University's centre for the
study of the child and society, and Amnesty International.
Delegates include pupils from Glasgow secondary schools vendors of the Big
Issue magazine, and representatives of homeless groups.
The main speaker will be Mr Fred Shortland, co-chairman of Amnesty
International's working group for children and a trustee of Casa Alianza, an
organisation which runs care, protection, and rehabilitation programmes in
Guatemala, Mexico, and Honduras.
He said yesterday that young homeless people in Central American countries
suffered some of the worst problems in the world.
The event will also feature a video, following Big Issue vendors on the streets
of Glasgow, and a production by the Scottish Youth Theatre highlighting the
problem of homelessness.

Rouen, Sunday
A FRENCH court today sentenced the Ukrainian captain of a cargo ship and his
second-in-command to life imprisonment for killing eight African stowaways at
sea off Portugal in 1992.
The court also sentenced three other Ukrainian crew from the vessel, the MC
Ruby, to 20 years each in prison for beating the eight with an iron bar,
shooting them, and dumping their bodies in the Atlantic Ocean.
Judge Jean Reynaud read out the sentences after more than 12 hours of
deliberations by the jury, ending a month-long trial over the deaths of seven
Ghanaians and one Cameroonian.
The grisly killings were discovered only because one Ghanaian stowaway,
Kingsley Ofusu, managed to escape the massacre and hide in the hold of the
vessel.
He sneaked ashore when the MC Ruby docked in a French port and told his story
to police. He took a handful of cocoa beans from the hold to help support his
story.
The court sentenced Captain Vladimir Ilnitskiy, 60, and his second-in-command,
Valery Artemenko, to life in jail for the killings, France's harshest criminal
penalty since it abolished the guillotine in 1981.
Ukrainian sailors Oleg Mikhailevsky, Petr Bondarenko, and Sergei Romashenko,
accused of carrying out the killings, were sentenced to 20 years in prison each.
The jury acquitted a sixth defendant from the Georgian region of Abkhazia,
Dzhamal Arakhamiya.
Unlike the others sentenced from the MC Ruby's 23-strong crew, Captain
Ilnitskiy had been accused only of complicity in the crimes. The other four
were accused of kidnapping, murder, and attempted murder.
The public prosecutor at the trial had urged the court to sentence all the
defendants to life imprisonment and had called Ilnitskiy a man ``who forbade
nothing, a Pontius Pilate who seeks refuge in false innocence''.
The accused had not denied the killings but each tried to minimise his role in
a trial that raised worrying questions over how often such incidents might
occur at sea. Ships face big fines if found to be carrying stowaways.
Second-in-command Artemenko tried to commit suicide in his cell last month. He
was pulled down by two cellmates after trying to hang himself from a window
with a tracksuit and was not seriously hurt.
The three sentenced to 20 years in jail each had pointed to Artemenko as the
ringleader.
The stowaways were found when some came out of hiding to search for water on
the voyage from Takoradi in Ghana to the German port of Hamburg. They were
locked up and later led out and murdered.-Reuter.

TOURISTS will be paying about 7% more for their overseas packages next summer
and could face a holiday shortage, a major travel survey warns today.
The average price of a summer 1996 inclusive tour will be about #380, says the
survey, entitled Summer Holidays Abroad.
With tour operators cutting back on the number of holidays on offer, ``holiday
scarcities will not be an operator's media hype but are likely to be a
reality'' it reported.
The survey, sponsored by the Travel Agency magazine and conducted by Surrey
University Research Fellow Allan Beaver, noted: ``Supply and demand are now in
balance for 1996. Holiday shortages will mean that holidaymakers may not get
their first choice unless they book early.''
While package tour numbers are expected to fall by 7%, trips to long-haul
destinations could increase by 10%, while the cruise market and the short
city-break holiday are both expected to grow by 5%.

THE price of Christmas dinner has dropped to an all-time low this year as
supermarkets compete to cut the cost of frozen turkeys in an effort to attract
customers.
Safeway has been advertising turkeys at just 29p per lb and now other
supermarkets are set to cut 6p from the price this week.
Sainsbury is re-pricing its frozen poultry to 29p a lb from today and Asda may
do the same.
However, the producers are not losing out as a result of the turkey price war.
They are getting about 68p a lb, according to Mr Grahame Jackman, president of
the National Federation of Poultry Producers, who describes the low cost as a
true ``loss leader''.
He said: ``The supermarkets are cutting prices as a way of getting customers
into their shops.
``The turkey is regarded as a key element of the Christmas food shop and,
therefore, advertising low prices is a good way to get people in to buy.''

THE latest attempts by the Ministry of Defence to find depleted uranium shells
fired into the Solway Firth appear to have failed.
The Ministry's Defence Test and Evaluation Organisation, which has been
overseeing the operations, believes the latest survey has been unsuccessful.
However, the Ministry, which owns the 4500-acre range at Dundrennan, near
Kirkcudbright, is to continue the search. Several attempts have been made to
recover the projectiles without success.
Over 13 years from 1981, the shells were tested and developed and thousands
fired into the firth.
Growing concern over the shells voiced by MPs, environmentalists, and people in
south-west Scotland led to the Ministry giving the go-ahead to look for some of
the 18 tonnes of shells fired at Dundrennan, which is to close in 1997.
Stewartry District Council has written to the DTEO stressing the importance of
recovering the shells for examination and has asked for the results of
monitoring.

SCOTLAND'S new councils could face financial penalties and administrative chaos
if they are forced to collect water and sewerage charges, a local government
leader warned yesterday.
The claim came from Councillor John Mullin, chairman of Strathclyde region's
finance committee, only months before the formal introduction of unitary
councils and separate water authorities on April 1 next year.
The Government published a consultation paper last week, in which it was made
clear that Ministers expect councils to be responsible for billing and
collecting water charges.
The paper says the councils will be the first point of contact for people who
have queries about their bills and adds that a combined council tax and water
bill will be ``in the interests of efficiency and ease of administration''.
It also reveals that, if the two sets of bodies cannot reach a negotiated
agreement for the administration costs of water bills, then the Government will
impose a 4% maximum charge.
Mr Mullin said that figure was ``ludicrous'', especially when the new councils
would not enjoy the economies of scale offered by a large regional authority,
such as Strathclyde. This year, the region spent more than #5m on bills.
Councillor Bob Gould, leader of the unitary Glasgow Council, is seeking
assurances from Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth that councils will receive
full reimbursement for all costs and any non-payment of water charges.
Mr Mullin said: ``If the water authority doesn't pay the full cost of billing,
the new councils will be considerably out of pocket. This is just one further
example of reorganisation causing higher costs and unnecessary problems.
``I fear that council services will suffer if people don't pay or are slow in
paying their water charges. There appears to be a legal obligation on councils
to pay up to the water authority, even if the money has not come in.''
In the event of non-payment, said Mr Mullin, the water ``quangos'' would not
suffer, while losses would have to be borne by council services such as
education and social work.
He added: ``The Government has a nerve passing legislation that takes water
services out of council control but at the same time asks councils to bill and
collect water charges which councils no longer have any responsibility for
setting.''

FOR most of the world, debates about BSE in beef are meaningless, since fish
provides more protein than beef, poultry, or any other animal source. However,
the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations is warning that
marine harvests face a clear and immediate danger.
The FAO says most of the planet's marine fisheries cannot be sustained.
Worldwide, extraction of wild fish peaked in 1989 - since then, tens of
thousands of fishing-related jobs have vanished, from Canada's Grand Banks to
South East Asia.
Earlier this year, the US National Academy of Sciences rated over-fishing as
the most serious threat posed by human activity to the world's oceans. One US
scientist went straight to the point. ``Any dumb fool knows there's no fish
around.''
Alasdair McIntyre, emeritus professor of fisheries and oceanography at the
University of Aberdeen, who is also former director of the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department Marine Laboratory, says a crisis has been
looming for generations.
``Although late 19th century biologists believed fish stocks could never be
depleted, by the early 20th century there were rumours of decline. By 1914 it
was recognised that North Sea stocks were declining.
``But cessation of fishing during World War One allowed recovery. Four years
respite during World War Two had similar effects.''
In the late 1940s, Professor McIntyre became a student icthyometrician
measuring catches in the North Sea. ``There were huge haddock - up to a foot
and a half long. But within a few years, they were fished out. By the 1960s all
species everywhere were under threat. We've been saying it in the scientific
literature for many years. Only now is the warning reaching a wider
consciousness.''
Worldwide, catches rose from 20 million tonnes in 1950 to 80 million in 1989.
Between 1970 and 1990, the world's industrial fishing fleet increased at twice
the rate of the global catch. US scientist Carl Safina estimates this armada
represents twice the capacity needed to extract what the oceans can sustainably
produce.
So-called ``over-capitalisation'' of the industry fuelled a vicious economic
and ecological cycle. As stocks plummeted, ships lost their market values.
Operators moved constantly to new species in new areas - to service spiralling
business loans.
Non-stop development of technology added to the intense activity. After 1945,
innovations such as sonar and radar spread rapidly into commercial fishing.
Carl Safina warns: ``The next century will witness the heretofore unthinkable
exhaustion of the oceans' natural ability to satisfy humanity's demand for food
from the seas.''
Fish-farming won't help much either. McIntyre is blunt about the limitations of
that industry: ``Fish eat fish.'' So, in order to sustain farmed shrimp
production in South America, offshore fishermen invest in fine-mesh nets which
captured every conceivable species to use as shrimp food. Much of this
so-called ``biomass fishing'' hits juveniles of wild species, destroying
reproduction cycles.
Farmed fish consume species such as eels which cannot be bred in captivity.
McIntyre says: ``Food is the key. If science can produce new sources of fish
food, such as plant-derived material, it's possible fish-farming could help.
But the next question is space for it. The whole coast of Ecuador for example,
is lined with shrimp ponds and they destroy the environment.
``Carl Safina notes drily that most fish-farmed products in the Third World are
exported to rich nations, leaving indigenous people to intensify ocean fishing
to meet their soaring food needs. Right now, salvation fish-farming looks like
the proverbial non-starter.''
Preferred solutions produce political paradoxes. For the world's threatened
fish stocks, rescue could take the form of highly individual forms of free
enterprise combined with rigid state control. McIntyre is attracted by
proposals for ``Individual Transferable Quotas'' - a form of ``privatisation of
the seas'' already flourishing in New Zealand and Iceland fisheries.
He says: ``Science advises on total quotas and each ship is guaranteed a
percentage of that each year. An operator can sell his quota on the market like
a house. It abolishes the old concept of fish stocks as common property.''
Conversely, massive policing, nationally and internationally, would be
necessary to prevent cheating.
However, to date, there's little evidence fishermen are prepared to play by any
rules.
Earlier this year, when Canada challenged illegal Spanish catches off
Newfoundland it was hailed as a triumph for conservationist values. Scottish
fishermen flew Canadian flags in salute to their trans-Atlantic comrades, but
amid a tidal wave of nationalistic reporting, no-one noticed that Canada, along
with Portugal and Japan, had opportunistically exceeded quotas on Atlantic
swordfish.
The crisis has arrived in Scotland. In Grampian, fish processors complain they
cannot obtain supplies - placing factory jobs at risk.
In the North Sea at the West Atlantic, various fisheries have been closed by
government order. McIntyre sees parallels with recent rapid changes in other
industries such as mining and farming.
``There's always been romance about these. But can we afford those traditions?
We have to develop systems of recompense for fishing communities hit by
necessary restrictions. Payments for decommissioning boats have to be developed
further.''
Fishermen have never had an Arthur Scargill. They are represented by an often
bewildering multiplicity of organisations. They lack the long-term PR clout
wielded by the National Farmers Union.
To date, most fishing-related protests have been limited to events within
fishing-related communities, but McIntyre fears coastal unrest could hit the
streets of British cities.
The fruits of the sea have long seemed an infinite bounty, but Ian Sutherland
examines warnings that throughout the oceans fish are becoming a rare catch

THIS week will provide a good test of the state of consumer confidence in the
run-up to Christmas, with a clutch of big retail names reporting results.
The Allders department store group kicks off today. Its airport duty free shops
should show improved trading, but weakness in High Street stores will cause an
overall annual profit slip to #23.5m from #25.4m, according to UBS.
Supermarket group Asda goes from strength to strength and is set for a bumper
profits rise when it reports half-year figures on Thursday. NatWest Securities
believes that new store openings and sales growth ahead of its rivals will
combine to fuel a 22% jump in interim profits to #135m.
Asda has been consolidating links with clothing group George Davis Partnership
and the City will be interested to hear comments on recent speculation that a
bidder lurks.
MFI has already warned that sales have fallen this year by around 3% and
brokers are expecting lower profits on Wednesday. BZW forecasts a 30% fall to
#18.5m for the six months to end November.
The prolonged hot summer is thought to have discouraged shoppers from buying
furniture and household goods.
The package holiday business woes will be aired today when Airtours reports
results. During the spring and early summer, tour operators were discounting
heavily to try to lure people abroad amid the UK heatwave. Airtours is expected
to have suffered with a fall in annual profit to below #60m from #82.3m.
Better news is expected from Stakis when it reports interims tomorrow. Merrill
Lynch expects it to increase pre-tax profit to #25.7m from #20.2m. The final
dividend is forecast to rise from 0.9p to 1.0p, making making 1.75p for the
year (1.55p).
Another batch of utility groups is due to unveil figures this week. Among them
is Scottish Hydro Electric, which publishes its half-yearly trading report on
Thursday.
The company was recently short-listed to buy the pumped storage business of the
National Grid. On the same day, Southern Electric and Southern Water are
expected to report higher profits.
Trafalgar House has seen its standing in the eyes of City analysts plummet this
year after a string of warnings about trading conditions.
The outcome of a dire year will emerge with results on Friday, when Trafalgar
will give details of write-offs on the construction side and in its Cunard
cruise liner business. Broker UBS has pencilled in losses of #125m and no
dividend in the last financial year.

GOVERNMENT plans to introduce immigration checks in the workplace are
``seriously flawed'', according to a TUC report issued today.
The Asylum and Immigration Bill, due to receive its second reading in the
Commons this afternoon, will impose 40 new burdens on business, the TUC said.
The Bill introduces penalties for employers hiring an immigrant who does not
have permission to work, with fines of up to #5000.
The TUC challenged claims that checking someone's employment status can be done
simply by requiring them to produce a National Insurance number.
There are people without NI numbers who have a right to work, including asylum
seekers, and some who have a NI number who do not have right, said the report.
TUC general secretary John Monks said: ``All along, the suspicion has been that
this Bill has more to do with an unpopular Government's attempt to appeal to
prejudiced voters rather than a measured response to a real problem.
``This report confirms that the attempt to introduce immigration checks into
every workplace is seriously flawed and will lead to employers having to become
experts in checking 40 different types of official document.''
The report said the Government had no idea of the difficulties of introducing
workplace immigration checks when it announced the Bill.
The TUC added that professional criminals would find the new system easy to
defraud because they could easily acquire false NI numbers.

MIKE Atherton refused to support the replacement of four-day Test matches with
a limited-overs contest in a bid to make cricket more interesting.
The England captain was absent on Saturday when Boland's suggestion to abandon
a first-class match and stage a limited-overs contest was agreed by the
tourists. He said: ``Four-day cricket is there to prepare us for Test matches
and that's why the itinerary is arranged that way.''
However, Atherton top-scored in the hastily-arranged limited-overs match. The
skipper's 77 led England to 244. With fast bowler Peter Martin - a candidate to
replace hamstring victim Darren Gough in Thursday's third Test against South
Africa at Durban - taking four for 35, the tourists romped to victory by 74
runs.
``Once the decision had been made, we had to win the game,'' said Atherton.
q MARK Ramprakash's rapidly declining tour hit rock bottom yesterday when he
was dismissed for a duck.
Back in October the Middlesex player was earmarked to solve all England's
problems at No.3 and runs flowed from his bat. But yesterday a gentle return
catch to medium-pacer Billy Stelling ruined his hopes of finding form.
Now, unless injuries change the picture, he may not get another innings before
the one-day internationals against South Africa.
Mike Atherton, back in action a week after his second Test heroics, scored 77
off 92 balls while opening partner Crawley contributed 48 to a stand of 84.
England threatened to make a mess of it in mid-innings as Graeme Hick cut
Adrian Kuiper to backward point, Graham Thorpe offered the same bowler a
caught-and-bowled chance, and Ramprakash came and went all too quickly.
Order was restored by a combination of Mike Watkinson, Dominic Cork and Jack
Russell. Here, Russell looked a picture of misery when last man Angus Fraser
was run out with two balls remaining, leaving him unbeaten on 29.
Russell need not have worried, for England's total proved sufficient, despite a
52-ball half-century from Kuiper. With 10 overs remaining and seven wickets
down and Boland requiring 85 runs there was a case for abandoning the match
through lack of interest.
That, to all intents and purposes, was what happened yesterday evening.
England, having made 402 for eight declared, narrowly failed to make Boland
follow on. For both teams, batsmen and bowlers alike, there seemed little
chance of a positive outcome and cricket gained a new result line - match
abandoned due to boredom.

THE SRU proposals for next season and beyond have been framed amid a welter of
competing - some contend selfish - interests and alternative agendas.
In particular, the issue of clubs or districts in Europe has been one which has
exercised many minds these past few months and accounted for many words in this
column.
Now the oracle has spoken and it is to be districts. SRU director of rugby Jim
Telfer told me it would be districts six months ago. I agreed with him then and
despite wavering once or twice in the intervening period, I have come full
circle, and, like the SRU, have concluded that the district route is the one
which is the most equitable and the most likely to kick-start the professional
era in Scotland.
This is not to say that there was no alternative. I believe that if Stirling
County, Melrose, Watsonians, or Boroughmuir had got the nod - and they might
yet if a compelling challenge to the SRU proposals can be mounted - then there
is no doubt that they could have put the European Cup cash (#100,000 plus gate
money this season) to good recruitment use.
However, would their advance on Europe have been good for the game as a whole?
Would the creation of three or four super-clubs have been of any benefit to the
100-plus clubs which constitute membership of the Union.
The SRU, which is responsible for stewardship of the entire game and not just
for a tiny elite, thought not and it is difficult to argue with that conclusion.
The SRU's declaration that it is concerned to provide a ``playing and financial
environment in which the most talented players are encouraged to remin in
Scotland'' means, we assume, that District players will be paid.
Presumably the details have yet to be worked out but, one assumes too, that a
percentage of whatever the player gets from his run with a District side in
Europe will go to his club and so the financial benefits of European
competition will have a ``trickle down'' effect to a greater spread of clubs
than if only three were involved.
It could be argued that this will only dilute the cash benefits of the European
Cup and that the most good could be done if Euro cash was distributed in larger
chunks to the select few. This would, though, create a major imbalance within
the domestic structure. It would be soccer's Rangers scenario but with knobs on.
Last week, when Edinburgh were in London for their inter-district tie with the
Exiles, the Edinburgh assistant coach Ian Barnes was pointing out that it is
wrong to make a comparison between the districts, as currently constituted,
playing in the inter-district championship and the district sides which will
compete in Europe.
For one thing, he argued, the European ties will attract the fans who are so
conspicuous by their absence at inter-district games. He put forward the
scenario, too, whereby if only three sides are to be in Europe - and this was
confirmed yesterday - then with four districts available, an annual challenge
by the non-competing district to one of the three who were in the previous
season's tournament would make for an enthralling afternoon's rugby. He is
right but it may, yet, come down to the creation of three ``super districts''
utilising the best 60-odd players in the country.
Nevertheless, his supposition that there will be only four districts next
season - and the inter-district championship is almost certainly a victim of
the new scenario - indicates that the Exiles will go by the board.
What then to do with the expatriates? One of the still unanswered questions is
whether or not the Peters and the Hiltons, Townsends and Dods, would be
released by their club sides to play district rugby. Probably not, if their
English clubs were involved in Europe as well.
However, for those who were to be released, a district of origin situation
would seem to provide a structure whereby they would not be entirely lost to
the Scottish game. In an ideal world, of course, they should be playing their
club rugby in Scotland anyway but this is not an ideal world and the SRU
proposals, condemned in some quarters as a compromise, strike us as going most
of the way to satisfying the the needs of the game as a whole and providing a
financial structure in which players - and clubs - will benefit.

LEN Lungo, who won the inaugural Herald Leading Scottish National Hunt trainer
award, is having a quiet start to the season, with only four winners from a
handful of runners.
Yesterday he hit out at some racecourses, - without naming names - for lack of
preparation.
The Carrutherstown trainer, 28 winners last season, attributed his
slower-than-normal start to ``the affects of the long, dry summer and autumn
and lack of preparation on the part of some racecoures.''
Lungo went on: ``We, the trainers, feel some of the preparation of many
racecourses leaves much to be desired. We feel some have not been producing the
ground required for National Hunt racing. We have met representatives of the
courses and put our case.''
The trainer said he and his owners had ``refused to pay the high price in
injuries'' which would have resulted from running horses, until now when
conditions had greatly improved.
``We are happy with the ground now. We are well entered up this week and hope
to have lots and lots of runners over the Christmas and new year period.''
Lungo admitted, however, that the stable could be hit by abandonments through
frost, and that with softer ground available, competition from now on would be
keener and winning more difficult.
At present he is lanquishing in fifth place in the championship, 10 behind the
current leader, Peter Monteith, and two behind the two woman challengers,
Lucinda Russell and Susan Bradburne.
Those who backed the Dumfriesshire trainer to repeat last season's success are
unlikely to be worried at this stage, because he was on the same total at this
time a year ago.
Much of his talented string are still to run. Santa Concerto, an impressive
winner of two bumpers, will have his first run over hurdles in the next couple
of weeks, and over the core period, between January and March, another 12
``unknows'' are due to appear for the first time.
``We will then see if our patience has paid off,'' said the trainer.
He revealed that plans to send Attadale, one of his top hurdlers, novice
chasing had had to be changed.
The seven-year-old, who changed owners for #25,000 at Doncaster in May, was
badly jarred when running at Aintree and will not be ready to run until
February and March.
``Because he will have such a short season we have decided to keep him to
hurdles and have another crack at the Gold Card at the Cheltenham Festival in
which he finished fifth last time.''
Tom Dyer's Chief Minister returned home to Invergowrie yesterday after a
fruitless 800-mile journey. The six-year-old left Tayside on Friday for
Cheltenham, where he was due to run in Saturday's Bonusphoto Bula Hurdle, but
the meeting was called off due to frost.
q TODAY'S scheduled meeting at Warwick became the season's sixth fixture to
fall to the weather. The course failed an inspection yesterday afternoon and
clerk of the course Peter McNeile said: ``There is still frost in the ground
and there are no prospects of racing.
``The temperature has barely got above freezing, we have a number of trouble
spots which gave us no hope, especially with such an early start scheduled.''

THE blues ain't nothin' but a good woman feelin' bad. Maybe, but not for Kurt
Weill's twentieth-century urban woman, who - in sleazy nightclubs in Berlin,
and on the streets of Paris or New York - has been there, seen it, done it, and
felt the hurt. For Weill, the blues ain't nothin' but a bad woman feelin' worse.
Weill's women are a disillusioned species who have been through the barriers of
pain and anguish. They emerge bitterly reflective and sardonic, their emotions
stripped to the bone.
And that was the weakness in Phillida Bannister's large scale survey of Weill's
women, performed in a lengthy series of songs on Saturday night at the Cottier,
in an appropriately darkened setting, with guitarist Alpin Smart.
Bannister has a beautiful contralto voice, rich in depth if limited in range,
and extremely polished. Almost too polished. Her style, through a set of 18
songs, was consistent: her phrasing is shapely and elegant.
And that was part of the problem. Many of these songs - Denn wie man sich
bettet from Mahagonny, Nanna's Lied, the Bilbao Song from Happy End, Je ne
t'aime pas, and many more - are songs from beyond the edge. Vocal artifice
disintegrates into hoarse, coarse emotion; but Bannister's voice remained
sculpted - not a phrase was split.
It was too pretty - though not for the gorgeous ballads, Speak Low and
September Song, from Weill's American period. And it was too operatic.
Performed six feet from the audience, Bannister's level of theatrical
exaggeration was over the top. Understatement would have been more appropriate.
Too pretty to be blue

IN EUROPE
THE European Court in Luxemburg is expected to confirm on Friday the Advocate
General's finding in the Jean-Marc Bosman case which would dismantle the
present transfer system and allow an unlimited number of foreign players who
are European nationals.
Theo van Zeggelin, general secretary of the European players union FIFPRO,
claimed last night that a deal had been agreed to phase in changes over the
next five years.
``There have been endless talks between clubs and associations about the impact
a ruling in favour of Bosman will have,'' he said. ``My understanding is that
the system now in place will not be changed immediately and clubs will be
allowed time to adjust. But the day is coming when players will be allowed to
move at the end of their contracts without a transfer fee.''
Bosman is seeking around #300,000 compensation from UEFA, the Belgian FA and
his former club FC Liege - which went bankrupt last season and no longer exists
- for blocking a move to Dunkirk by asking an unreasonable fee.
Bosman, his career in limbo, took to drinking heavily and his marriage broke up.
Nowdays he plays with Vise, a fourth division amateur club in Belgium, and
lives with his parents in their converted garage. He claims he has refused
substantially more sums than he is suing for to drop his test case.
Italy's Senate has agreed to scrap the three foreigners rule.
This was originally mooted by Lega Nord, a right wing political party, and has
still to be ratified by their government. Reaction is mixed.
AS Roma president Franco Sensi said: ``This is the correct way forward as it
will stabilise the transfer market. Deflation will follow because too many
clubs will no longer be chasing too few players.''
But AC Milan captain Franco Baresi said: ``This is a frightening development
because of the impact it will make throughout European football.''
q FRENCH football is to introduce a fair play factor to clean up their game.
Next season referees and linesmen will award points to each team based on their
discipline. Those teams with the better records will enjoy home advantage when
their cup competition is drawn.

Rangers 1, Partick Thistle 0
FOR ALL his problems over the years, Andy Goram has been able to maintain a
standard of excellence which has elicited a remarkable unanimity among football
aficionados in this country, that he is not only the best keeper in Scotland
but probably Britain and maybe even Europe.
He was at his usual brilliant, but safe best when he might not have expected to
be required all that often against Thistle, but the rarity of this occasion was
that the goalie at the other end matched his skills.
Mark Cairns was bound to be busier anyway, but there were times when his
agility and judgment were of the highest order, as good as the star turn
himself. That is quite a feat for a man who has been put under considerable
pressure as the stand-in for Nicky Walker.
When Walker broke his jaw a couple of weeks ago, it was generally expected that
manager Murdo MacLeod would search around for an experienced replacement.
Instead, the Thistle leader decided he would give the reserve goalie his chance.
The new man came in against Aberdeen last week, a daunting task in itself, but
was outstanding in his team's 1-0 win. At Ibrox, he had to cope with the league
leaders in front of 43,173 people.
He was again quite magnificent. He had a series of wonderful saves, most of
them he reckoned from Rangers' best player, Charlie Miller, who was exasperated
but magnanimous in his praise of the keeper.
``I don't think I did that well,'' said the keeper, who had a spell with
Hearts, ``but I don't think Charlie was too pleased. I enjoyed myself and, to
be honest, the game just flew past.''
The Edinburgh-born keeper was desperate to get his chance in the top team when
Walker was injured. ``I was pretty confident I could handle it, but I probably
won't last long when he is fit again.''
That remains to be seen, but the senior goalie will be the first to concede he
might have a job on his hands. Although Cairns' contribution, particularly one
point-blank save from Miller (``I can't remember ever hitting the ball
harder''), was a major factor in Thistle coming close to embarrassing the
champions, his was not a solo effort.
The Firhill side defended really well and, when given the chance, looked
capable of snatching an equaliser. In fact, but for Goram, they would have. One
of the Scotland keeper's saves, from Stephen Docherty, was breathtaking, but
there were a few other that came into the marvellous class.
Rangers, almost to a man, seemed to decide the points were won when they scored
through Gordon Durie early in the second half. Durie headed in at the far post
when Craig Moore sent over a fine cross from the right. There were those who
were churlish enough to suggest Cairns should have reached the ball before it
got to the striker but include me out.
At anyrate, the Thistle lads soon sensed that they had a genuine chance of
nullifying that score and for much of the last half an hour they put Rangers
under pressure. They did everything right but could not get past the man in the
Ibrox goal. Well, not quite everything, because Wayne Foster played the Silly
Billy in the last minute when he got himself sent off.
His team were awarded a free kick but Foster appeared to be insisting to
referee Gerry Evans that some retribution should be administered to the man who
committed the foul, Gordan Petric, just as Tommy Turner had been booked earlier.
He might have had a case but it is not an admirable trait of the game these
days to see any player recommending a card for another. In any case, Evans
reckoned he had had enough, booked the player and then, when Foster applauded
cynically, quite correctly sent him off.
Foster then applauded again and was a very fortunate man that the referee did
not take further action.
MacLeod was none too pleased with his man, either. ``He will be disiciplined.
He has been long enough in the game to know better and it is disappointing to
know we are going to Kilmarnock next week without our main striker.''
Miller, who assumed the major mifield role in the absence of Paul Gascoigne,
admitted that the English star was missed but also praised the debut of Derek
McInnes. ``He is a very good player who likes to pass the ball,'' he said, ``I
thought he did well.''
The midfield man was phsyically sick at half-time and revealed that Moore had
also suffered in the same way. ``I just hope it is not a virus because some of
the lads are feeling a bit seedy.''

<HEADLINE>Agriculture will be affected by imports as foreign competitors improve their technology Research centre under threat</HEADLINE>

JUST outside Dundee, there exists what must be one of the world's most
intensive farming units providing much of the globe with technology for food
production and the survival of rural communities.
On just 200 hectares, there are, among more than 400 people, some who are
capable of producing not just the best potatoes and carrots or the tastiest
soft fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries and their derivatives, but
crops that will benefit populations in tropical and sub-tropical countries.
But, as it celebrates its 75th anninversary, this world famous research centre
is under threat.
The director of the Scottish Crop Research Institute, Dr John Hillman, has made
it clear that within the next decade or two UK agriculture will be affected by
imports and as foreign competitors improve their technology and our producers
will have to become not only more efficient but will have to diversify and meet
the challenge of providing recreational and conservation amenities.
``To the detriment of existing and future generations of scientists, there is a
danger that all the hard work, invention, and discovery that have gone into the
last 75 years could be dismantled,'' he said.
The Scottish Crop Research Institute, along with others like the Macaulay, is
under Government scrutiny in yet another exercise in cost-cutting, although it
has been claimed that SCRI researchers, working on a budget of #13m, contribute
more to the demands of food producers and processors than any other
organisation.
It is a centre with an internationally recognised reputation for co-ordinated
research, which has evolved dynamically in a highly competitive market.
The history of the institute goes back to 1919 when far sighted members of the
Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, an organisation that was
set up to do more than just protect landowners' interests, decided that,
following the First World War, Britain should not be seen to be so dependent on
food imports.
They founded the Scottish Society for Research in Plant Breeding and by 1920
had raised #45000, sufficient to establish a research station next to the
government seed testing station at East Craigs, Edinburgh, concentrating
initailly on oats, barley, and potatoes.
The SSPB quickly outgrew the facilities at East Craigs and in 1955 moved to new
premises at Pentlandfield on the Bush Estate, south of Edinburgh, which was
rapidly becoming the base for research and development work by the East of
Scotland College of Agriculture and the University Agricultural Department. In
1981, SPBS was merged with the Scottish Horticultural Institute at Invergowrie
to become today's SCRI.
We all know, or should know, the Pentland names Ace, Beauty, Crown, Dell,
Ebony, Falcon etc - potato varieties that have left their mark on the farming
and gardening world, although we are not as aware of the many others which have
become invaluable overseas.
Present day Brodick, Torridon, and Stirling are descendants of the early
pioneer work and in the long-term business of plant breeding, there are
numerous more selections in the pipeline.
I remember, in the 1960s, meeting Dr William Black, the director at
Pentlandfield, who was explaining the continuing need for scientists to go to
South America and search for genetic material.
``Who do you think invented instant mash,'' he said. ``The Incas, who would
grub up tubers and leave them out on the mountainside to freeze before crushing
them for storage. Basic technology with a material that we have developed in
breeding programmes to give us the high yielding varities needed in modern
agriculture.''
Today, the SCRI works closely with the potato processors in developing its
reseach strategy. It has gained more than #500,000 from major crisp
manufacturers for a research programme aimed at producing an improved, more
environmentally friendly product which will store better without producing the
sugars that cause broning in the crisping process. This work is with Mylnefield
Research Services, the commercial arm of SCRI, and involves several thousand
clones in field trials that will continue until at least 1998.
Dr Hillman said research on strategic and basic aspects of the genetics,
physiology, and pathology of potatoes would continue to be developed, yielding
results that would be relevant to the crop worldwide and to plant science in
general.
Mylnefield is perhaps best known for its work on soft fruit, Tayside having
been the home of the important raspberry crop since the 1920's. From the early
work of Scottish Raspberry Investigation, it incorporated the strawberry
investigation unit of the West of Scotland Agricultural College.
While soft fruit crop yield levels are still important, the SCRI breeding
programme also takes into regard environmental factors such as reduced use of
fertiliser, fungicides, and insecticides and, indeed, water.
The aim is to improve quality and to identify and incorporate new sources of
resistance to pests and disease.
A 20-year long research programme led to the release in 1988 of Loch Ness, the
first European-bred, spine-free blackberry.
SCRI blackcurrants occupy over 60% of the UK total and continued research is
directed to and supported by the processing industry. As with potatoes, the
geneticists working with soft fruits have given us varieties that are known to
gardeners as well as commercial growers, Glen Clova, Glen Garry, and Glen
Prosen raspberries, the strawberry varities Rhapso and Melody, and
blackcurrants Ben Lomond, Ben Nevis, and more recently Ben Connan.
They have also produced the Tayberry, a blackberry-raspberry hydbrid and the
Tummelberry, and work is going on to produce spine-free variations of those.
SCRI is also involved in projects involving oilseed rape amd its potential
pharamceutical properties. Research work includes rice, groundnut, coffee, and
even the kiwi fruit. Last week, a delegation from Ukrania visited Mylnefield to
study the barley breeding programme which been so valuable to the brewing and
distilling industries, one more example of the international recognition earned
by the research unit which, with its 9500 square metres of glasshouse, is the
biggest rural employer on Tayside.
``Our work is for the benefit of the growers, the processor, the consumer, and
the environment. Let us hope that what we have achieved will not be
dismantled.''

THE big three clubs in the land may want club representation in Europe next
season, but there is a country-wide split, and those in the West are more
concerned at having a system in place that lets their best players, no matter
the clubs they come from, have a genuine chance of participation in Europe.
They say that provincial rugby has to be sold properly and the existing
district championship should be scrapped.
They say that if clubs go into Europe it will not be good for Scottish rugby.
``Personally I am all for districts or provinces playing in Europe,'' said GHK
president Jimmy Martin, reacting to news that it is the provinces, possibly
even amalgamated provinces, who will carry Scotland's banner in European
competition next season.
``I would hate us to get into a mess like the SFA where someone in Forfar has
as big a say as anyone, and there is a chance of that if the clubs have the
biggest say. We have people like Jim Telfer at the helm, and they should have
their say. We have put them in their place of power, and we should not then
dismiss their ideas and their system. If he thinks districts are the way ahead
then we should support him in that.''
Those were sentiments echoed by Brian Williams, the president of Glasgow
Southern. ``We totally agree with GHK,'' he said. ``We are very worried about
the self-perpetuation of what could become elite super clubs who would get all
of the money. Players would move clubs to play in Europe, which would mean the
death of some clubs. The best thing is for the provinces to represent Scotland
in Europe and for the clubs to get the trickle-down effect of any money. It's a
big thing for a player at our club to know that he can play for Glasgow
Southern and still play in Europe if he gets selected to play for the
province.''
``I am totally against clubs in Europe,'' says former international stand off
and chairman of the Glasgow Accies sports club, Brian Simmers. ``There has been
a lot of chat about support.
``To me it is a question of organisation and preparation. There should be three
regional sides that play in Europe, they should be given their rightful place
in the calendar including Saturday fixtures, and the whole thing has to be
marketed properly. I think that Europe is an exciting step up before
international matches, and these three provinces could be prepared just like
international sides. They would have a minimum of four games in Europe for each
team, and if it was sold properly these teams would be well supported.''
the president of West of Scotland, Alasdair Burnet, agreed that provincial
rugby is best for Scotland. ``I see Stirling are calling for more meetings, but
you have to admire the union for grabbing the bull by the horns,'' he said.
All of which signals a power struggle in Scottish rugby as the big clubs
attempt to wrestle support for their participation in Europe and control of the
agenda, while the vast majority of clubs will want to be able to contribute
their players for the highest level. Especially Glasgow clubs.
Everyone knows that district rugby is the logical step up. But the joke has
been the lack of support for it from your average man. There has been no
identity. I can't think of the last bit of marketing the SRU undertook to sell
district rugby to the population, other than telling us it was happening, even
if it was on a Sunday.
At this stage the Tory government would issue a statement talking about market
forces, and I believe that a ``super province'' playing Toulouse, for example,
on a Saturday, would generate a crowd. That would be market forces at work.
What people fail to see is that European competition - just as Brian Simmers
says - will give our domestic scene the kind of excitement we have been crying
out for. The clubs in the West are keen that the provinces take part as, I'm
sure, do the vast majority of clubs in the country.

ALAN CATTO has every reason to remember 1992 - a year in which he bought his
first house, was made redundant, got married and launched his own company Voice
&amp; Data.
Alan began the company which designs, instals, and supports computer networks
with the help of a #40 a week enterprise allowance. He said: ``I had always
fancied the idea of running my own business, but the catalyst was when I was
made redundant from my job as a computer technician.
``You had to be unemployed before you could get on the six weeks business
management course and claim the enterprise allowance. I signed on the dole for
two weeks then applied for the course.''
Alan had to wait eight weeks until another course was due to start, but he
spent the time preparing the ground for his new company.
When he started up Alan Catto hired two technicians to help him with the
contracts, but after eighteen months he was joined by his wife Michelle Rodger,
a journalist, who became marketing director and Neil Crawford, an industrial
economist, who is commercial director.
``After eighteen months I was getting to the point where we were being offered
work I couldn't refuse, but I needed help to run the company,'' he said.
The company's rapid growth means that it now employs 17 people and this year
had a #750,000 turnover.
``We expect our turnover next year to be #1m, and we are now working with Blue
Chip companies which has catapulted us to the size we are today,'' said
Michelle Rodger.
Voice &amp; Data's customer base now stretches from Oban in the north of Scotland
to Milton Keynes in the south of England.
``We are the same as a service engineer, the work has to be done to deadlines.
We will work round the clock to ensure that everything is in place for our
customers when their are due to start work,'' said Alan Catto.
Voice &amp; Data, which is based at the Abbey Business Centre, Paisley, is now
moving into supporting telephone systems, as these become linked to a company's
computer network.
Looking back Alan Catto smiled when he said: ``It was a hectic time, and it
certainly concentrated the mind when you buy a house in March, are made
redundant in May and then get married at the same time as starting your own
company.''

RONALD Stevenson's first piano concerto was a Faust triptych, his second a tour
of five continents. His new cello concerto, played by Moray Welsh in Glasgow on
Saturday, likewise covered considerable ground in its quest to pay tribute to
Jacqueline Du Pre in terms elegiac but not programmatic.
As with the piano concertos, there was a subtitle - The Solitary Singer - and
Stevenson's various cultural identities, not only Scottish but on this occasion
Israeli, proved as intrusive as ever.
I'm not sure if it was really a good idea to incorporate a hiking song of the
Israeli Young Pioneers quite so prominently in the form of a cello solo at the
height of the central scherzo. It threatened to steer the music in just the
programmatic direction the composer sought to avoid.
However, in the two flanking slow movements, Stevenson's source material -
including allusions to Hebrew melody and to Schumann's cello concerto - seemed
better integrated into the generally elegiac mood. Moray Welsh conveyed it all
very tenderly, right up to the final soaring evocation of a Hugh MacDiarmid
poem.
As conducted by Walter Weller, some of the orchestral writing sounded
ponderous, though less so than Brahms's Fourth Symphony, which trudged at
funereal pace.
Wagner's Siegfried Idyll at the start of the evening was also uncommonly slow,
though the quiet radiance of the playing did suggest that inside Weller the
symphonic conductor there may be a conductor of chamber music trying to creep
out.

GORDON Richards has reported that impressive Haydock Park winner One Man in
good form after Saturday's exertions.
The Greystoke trainer said: ``He is fine and there are no problems with him and
he is well on course for the King George VI Tripleprint Chase at Kempton Park
on Boxing Day.
``If he keeps fit, Tony Dobbin will more than likely take the ride.'' Stable
jockey Dobbin, although not race riding because of injury, has been riding out
at Richards' yard and will continue so to do before he resumes on the track,
possibly next weekend.
Dobbin rode One Man at Kempton last season in the Racing Post Handicap Chase in
February when the grey had a crashing fall at the twelfth fence when travelling
well.
Richards is not concerned about a repeat of that blunder with the gelding's
confidence on a high after an exhibition round of jumping at the weekend. The
highlight of which was a prodigious leap at the second last that conjured
memories of Pendil and Desert Orchid.
Ironically it was the only fence that Mark Dwyer, deputising for Dobbin, had to
put the horse right in an otherwise flawless round.
Dwyer, whose list of big-race triumphs includes the Cheltenham Gold Cup twice
and Champion Hurdle, said: ``On that sort of ground this horse is as good as
any I've ridden although whether he would be as effective on heavy going
remains to be seen.''
q ADRIAN Maguire's build-up to his return to race riding begins in earnest
today when he rides work for retainer David Nicholson - and the jockey has
pencilled in Saturday as the day for his comeback.
Maguire, who has been out of action since cracking his left fibia at Ascot last
month, was originally planning to return last week, but delayed his plans on
the advice of specialist Michael Foy of the Ridgeway Hospital in Swindon.
Now, however, the jockey feels fit enough to ride out at Jackdaws Castle today,
with a view to returning under Rules at Ascot.
``Hopefully I will be back next Saturday,'' he said. ``I am due to see the
specialist next Thursday. He has been quite pleased with it.
``As far as Mary Bromiley and Michael Foy are concerned, there are no problems
whatsoever.''
q CHELTENHAM'S managing director, Edward Gillespie, has announced measures to
refund racegoers and partly compensate owners after Saturday's Tripleprint Gold
Cup meeting was dramatically called off at the eleventh hour.
``All the paying customers need to do is send their badge or ticket receipt to
Cheltenham racecourse and they will be refunded in full,'' said Gillespie.
``We would look to have it all sorted out within three weeks. ``The owners of
the 46 runners will be credited with #200 through Weatherbys as a contribution
to there travelling expences,'' he concluded.
With Philip Arkwright officiating at the Haydock meeting, Gillespie stood in as
Cheltenham's clerk of the course.
Trainers have criticised the poor communications by a racecourse that had
earlier issued assurances that the fixture, due to feature the Bula Hurdle and
Tripleprint Gold Cup, was not under threat.
Disappointed trainer Toby Balding said: ``It was a touch and go decision so
they were entitled to get us there but the public should have had more warning.
``If, earlier in the day, they had said they were going to look at the course
then some people may not have had a wasted journey.''
The stewards, who finally called off the meeting, were given no prior
indication that the cold weather threatened the fixture.
Stewards' secretary Rachel Tonks explained: ``It is the prerogative of the
panel chairman to inspect the course as soon as he arrives and it was then that
he called in his fellow stewards.''

A TEENAGE girl was critically ill after being injured in a single car crash in
Inverness on Saturday evening.
Pauline King, 16, of Balliferary Lane, Inverness, suffered serious head
injuries and was treated at the neurosurgery department of Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary, Forresterhill, following the accident in Millburn Road.
The girl was a passenger in a Vauxhall Astra car which ran out of control into
a shop, knocking down a lamp-post, and rupturing a gas main.
The three other occupants of the Astra received minor injuries and were
discharged after treatment at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.
Police appealed yesterday for witnesses to come forward.
q A 23-year-old man was killed early yesterday morning while he was walking on
a main road. The pedestrian was struck by a car as he walked up the A90 Brechin
by-pass. The accident happened at 2am near to the St Annes junction on the
north-bound carriageway. Emergency services were alerted by the car driver
after the accident.
Police, who appealed for witnesses, were witholding the man's name until
relatives had been informed.
q One person has died and two others, including a 10-year-old schoolgirl, have
been seriously injured in separate road accidents at the weekend in the East of
Scotland.
In Berwickshire a 45-year-old social worker was fatally injured in an accident
involving his motor cycle on the A6112 Duns to Grantshouse road near to
Drakemyre on Saturday.
He has been named by Lothian and Borders police as Mr Harry McIntosh, of Pilrig
Cottages, Leith.
In Edinburgh, the schoolgirl suffered serious head injuries when she was
knocked down by a Ford Fiesta in the city's Old Dalkeith Road near its junction
with Walter Scott Avenue.
The girl who has not been identified was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick
Children where she underwent an emergency operation. Her condition is described
as serious.
Lothian and Borders police have appealed for witnesses to the accident on
Saturday afternoon.
Mr Michael Ford, of Bughtlin Loan, Edinburgh, is critically ill in the Royal
Infirmary after being knocked down by a Ford Escort in the city's Maybury Road
on Saturday night. Police are seeking witnesses.
q Three drivers and 12 coach passengers ``miraculously'' escaped serious injury
in a pile-up on the A74 Glasgow-Carlisle Road on Saturday.
A lorry which had overturned after skidding on black ice came to rest in the
fast lane of the northbound carriageway near Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire.
The abandoned lorry was struck by a car and both vehicles were crushed by a
50-seat coach which ploughed into them.
``Miraculously, no-one was injured,'' said a Dumfries and Galloway Police
spokesman.

THREE years ago Harry Warnock and Neil Henderson decided to give up their
positions with a national firm of design engineers and strike out on their own.
The result was that Henderson Warnock mechanical and electrical engineers was
formed. After only two weeks it had secured its first contract involving the
refurbishment of Baird Hall, Strathclyde University's student residences in
Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street.
Since then Henderson Warnock has continued to gain contracts despite the dearth
of public sector projects.
``The reason we left our previous jobs was that we could see that we were going
nowhere. Like other national companies it had grown accustomed to working on
big public sector projects, and just waited for the phone to ring but the
projects had disappeared.''
Both engineers, however, believed that there was business to be gained, as long
as you were willing to go out and find it, and their experience has proved them
correct.
Sixteen design engineers are now employed by Henderson Warnock, and this figure
is expected to grow.
``The amount of enquiries, and the size of the enquires are increasing,'' said
Harry Warnock who admits to being ``astounded'' at how well they have done.
The reason behind their success, at a time when the construction industry is
still in the doldrums, and recovery from the recession has been sluggish, is
because we do things differently, said Harry Warnock
``We become totally involved with our clients,'' he said, ``and although the
big projects are disappearing, there are still many small and medium ranged
contracts available.''
Harry Warnock cites the firm's approach to the GDA, about the possibility of
providing funding to have the Baird Hall floodlit, as an example of how it
becomes involved in a contract
``This is a striking building, and was formerly the Beresford Hotel which was a
landmark in Sauchiehall Street,'' he said. ``Strictly speaking it had nothing
to do with us, but we approached the GDA and got the money to have it floodlit,
and the university was delighted.''
Henderson Warnock is presently involved in its largest project the #6m Lexmark
factory in Rosyth, and is considering opening an office in Edinburgh.

FIRST it was Britannia - the yacht, not the icon - that was torpedoed, then it
was the turn of the Queen's Flight to be shot down in flames. All part of the
drive for a leaner, meaner Britain, No.10 told the Palace, and HM retorted
``Horribilis''.
Now the royal train has gone under the hammer to a business from the Badger
State; no longer British owned but a mere cog in a railroad empire that got
where it is today by beating off the Apache and running rings round the James
Brothers.
It can be but a matter of days before the mint wafer on the royal pillow is
replaced by a Tootsie Roll and cola ousts chateaux-bottled from the dining car.
When winter really does come and the royal party is delayed it will not be due
to the shape of the flakes but because the wrong type of buffalo is on the line.
Where will it all end? Already Prince Philip has had to forego his customary
Sunday morning chukka round the throne room because the hoi polloi, at eight
quid a skull, have been let in to browse, and John Major, tape measure in hand
and two property developers in train, is perpetually under foot.
Now it should not be imagined for one minute that a trip in Britannia is
unalloyed joy. For a start every locker in the part-time hospital ship is
jammed with prosthesis and pots of Stockholm tar for the stumps, full up to the
extent that jewellery sometimes has to be stowed in the hold.
Further, the pervading smell of ether puts something of a damper on parties,
although there is never a risk that the crew will chat up the female guests.
But it is a yacht and handy for a quick trip to Tonga or a week or two of
looking pale but interesting off the Out Skerries.
Now, however, it is going: up for grabs as a floating tandoori restaurant,
mobile ticket office for the National Lottery or home for delinquent youth. And
not much better can be said for the Queen's Flight. Once upon a time it was
Andovers here, there and everywhere, down to the shops or a quick return trip
to Germany to see the republican branch of the family...... Von and Zu so to
speak. Now the only Andover left is on permanent deployment dropping stockfish
on to the heads of the Dark Continent's dispossessed and the sole aircraft on
call is a Sopwith Pup.
Having only recently discovered income tax, Her Majesty is on the point of
discovering a great deal more. Booking early for a cut-price package tour with
a cruise company based in Piraeus and flagged in Liberia will be a new
experience, as will tourist class and a self-destructing micro-waved whole
tomato down the ermine at 30,000 feet.
But from the boys from Oshkosh, or wherever in Wisconsin they raise steam and
hose out the cow-catchers, our royal family can expect only courtesy and
selfless dedication to the comfort of their passengers. American railmen, when
not busy looking out for blown bridges, Myrna Loy on the line, or gents with
handkerchiefs over their faces, do the handsome thing.
For a start, they will say ``Ma'am'' and ``Sir'' in a convincing manner, for
that is how they address each other. In addition, if there is something wrong,
they will make amends. And how. One recent traveller on an American sleeping
car found a bed-bug in the sheets. He wrote to head-office to complain.
By return he had his reply. Abject apologies were offered and the reassurance
given that it would never happen again. The sleeping car attendant, wrote the
railroad company, had been fired, the contract laundry struck off, the coach
withdrawn from service and destroyed by fire. The depot manager had been
reduced in rank to porter and would the unhappy traveller do them the honor
(for this was an American letter) of dropping in for lunch with the board when
next he was in town?
Mollified, the bug-bitten traveller was on the point of writing back to plead
for the job of the sleeping car attendant when he discovered, pinned to the
back of the letter, his original complaint. Written in the margin was the
cryptic message - ``Send this nut the bug letter''.
New experiences await the House of Windsor.
George Hume reports that from now on, whether the
royal family travels by train, boat or plane, they will
certainly find it a mind-broadening experience

DECEMBER will be an important month in the fortunes of the Dounreay nuclear
plant. A statement is expected from the US Department of Energy on whether
reprocessing at Dounreay is a reasonable solution to the problem posed by
15,000 spent nuclear fuel rods currently piled up at more than 30 research
reactors across Europe.
Imminent also are the results from a Caithness-wide referendum which should
show whether the 20,000 voters in the county want foreign reprocessing on their
doorsteps. The referendum itself has become an issue, the subject of bitter
debate.
Two years ago the American DoE was opposed to the nuclear fuel rods, which it
had been supplying to European reactors over a 20-year period until 1978, being
sent to Dounreay for reprocessing. It was seen as inconsistent with its
non-proliferation policy.
Dounreay believes there was always more than one view in the US, but in 1993
the department did offer Belgian research reactor operators SCK-CEN $500,000
not to proceed with a reprocessing contract at Dounreay.
The rods had been due to go back to America but since 1988 domestic opposition
to them being received has grown, not least from Carroll Campbell, the governor
of South Carolina where the military nuclear complex of Savannah River is
located.
The American government earlier this year embarked on a major public
consultation programme over the issue. One of the options American citizens
were asked to consider was reprocessing at Dounreay. It is thought to hold
certain attractions for the US public.
Despite public denials, the Department of Trade and Industry has been busy
lobbying on Dounreay's behalf to win contracts to reprocess a sizeable
proportion of the rods. The attraction to the UK government is clear. Faced
with costs of decommissioning Dounreay estimated at #500m, the plant's
potential for earning #10m a year from reprocessing can't be ignored.
To Dounreay's director John Baxter, who is also the Atomic Energy Authority's
Nuclear Site Operations director for the whole of Britain, the prospect of the
work is very important: ``The European research reactor reprocessing has 65
jobs associated with it. Fifty are current jobs on the site and when we run the
Materials Testing Reactor reprocessing plant another 15 jobs are created. The
bottom line is if we don't get the work we will lose 65 jobs.
``Clearly I think our nuclear business will decline, because the research
reactor business we are looking at is for something like five to 10 years. But
if we can have a reasonably stable employment base for a five to 10-year period
it gives better prospects for building new business.''
Important as the jobs are, their jeopardy can't quite explain how badly
Dounreay's management appear to have been stung by Greenpeace's claim that the
waste from reprocessing the research reactor rods would not be returned to the
country of origin; instead it would stay at Dounreay, and vitrified waste from
Sellafield returned in its place. Dounreay was outraged by the suggestion which
was styled as disinformation, misinformation, lies. Categoric denials were
quickly issued.
Just over a week after Greenpeace had made its statement at a press conference
in Inverness, it emerged that the organisation was not alone in believing that
Dounreay was considering such a substitution deal with Sellafield. The American
DoE was also labouring under that impression as its draft Environmental Impact
Study made clear: ``Another drawback to reprocessing at Dounreay is that
Dounreay cannot produce vitrified waste that the United States can accept. The
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is considering a proposal to substitute
vitrified waste from its Sellafield plant for Dounreay cemented waste as a
means of shipping out a waste form that the United States could accept.
``Under the alternative of reprocessing overseas at Dounreay, United States
acceptance of foreign-generated waste might be necessary for countries that
lack any means of storing or disposing of the spent nuclear fuel or chemical
separation waste.''
John Baxter insists, however, substitution is not on the Dounreay agenda:
``Clearly British Nuclear Fuels (Sellafield) are looking at it and it might be
something that happens in the future, but it is not anything we are proposing
in what we are negotiating now. We are looking to ship it back to Europe, and
for Europe it would be cemented drums.
``There is nothing we are negotiating about substitution, if we were I would
tell people. But my position is quite simple, if we were proposing substitution
I would be the guy that was arguing against it.''
Subsequently it emerged that if there ever was substitution the waste wouldn't
stay at Dounreay but would go to the Nirex waste repository, if one was built
by then.
But the issue has brought relations between Dounreay and their environmental
critics to a new low, and the management hold it as just one of many
distortions which will render worthless the referendum that the Caithness
Against Nuclear Dumping (Cand) group has commissioned from the independent
Electoral Reform Ballot Services at a cost of #10,000.
Dounreay will have nothing to do with it, according to John Baxter: ``I think
the key thing is that Greenpeace and Cand do not appear to be respecting the
democratic processes. The MP, local district councillors have actually made the
point that the way they are undertaking this referendum does not allow time for
sensible public debate.
``The debate so far has been in the media. There has not been an agreement on
leaflet campaigns or protocols on how the debate will be carried out. Unless
you have an agreed protocol, just like before a general or local elections, I
don't believe we are following a democratic process. Our big objection is not
that Greenpeace gave Cand #3000. One of our very strong objections is that they
wrote me a letter challenging Dounreay to a debate in public; 24 hours later
Cand announced the ballot papers were in the post. Now that is not a
responsible approach.''
But would Dounreay's attitude have been different had Cand come to them months
ago to agree a protocol?
``I don't think it would. Clearly we take advice from our government department
(the DTI) over whether this is a valid way to consider the subject and the
advice we have is it isn't. I think our position would be the same even if
there was a large majority in favour of reprocessing.
``We shouldn't forget, as I have told Cand, Greenpeace and others, that there
is public consultation on our discharge authorisations; without these discharge
authorisations we can't reprocess.''
Mr Baxter's view of the referendum is shared by Caithness and Sutherland MP
Robert Maclennan, who last month delivered an extraordinary attack, describing
it as attempted fraud and blaming outside groups.
This emotion generated by the referendum is surprising. Two separate
referendums were held on Harris over the superquarry; indeed not only did the
second one result in the Western Isles Council reversing its policy, the
council even paid the bill.
But things are different at Dounreay, where there is still a pride in the
nuclear industry which is little shared outside it. Whatever the result of the
referendum, it is unlikely that the plant will come out of it smelling of
roses. Negative publicity appears to stalk the management's every move. John
Baxter, with some justification, believes part of the reason for the continued
bad headlines lies in the plant's greater openness.
``When I took over 18 months ago I wanted a complete audit of the whole site.
It was almost like a super MOT. I wanted to look at everything and it revealed
more than we had expected. In all the jobs I have done I have always tried to
be as open as I can, and so over the past 12 months there has been a steady
list of things. It doesn't mean that Dounreay is any less safe, it just means
that we are telling people about these things.''
Unfortunately for its public image, Dounreay's glasnost has been matched in
recent weeks by HM Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, who told a recent local
liaison committee meeting that they were taking very seriously the
contamination of two workers. In media interviews it was made clear prosecution
was a possibility. The procurator-fiscal in Wick awaits a report being prepared
by the NII now citing five men as having suffered.
The NII can't be dismissed as part of the media frenzy that many Caithnessians
believe is harming their economic prospects. Some were concerned enough that in
September they formed a group to counter irresponsible journalism. Such are
Dounreay's fortunes these days, it hasn't met since.
As Dounreay battles to win vital reprocessing work, David Ross, Highland
Correspondent, examines how a debate in America and a bitter campaign much
closer to home could prove costly for the nuclear plant in Caithness

MORE than half of all drivers in Scotland are risking painful neck injuries in
road accidents because of wrongly-positioned head restraints.
``Over 50% of motorists are putting their necks on the line unnecessarily,''
said Ms Sue Nicholson, spokeswoman for the RAC in Scotland, after a nationwide
spot-check survey carried out by the motoring organisation found that many
headrests were set at the wrong height.
Whiplash injuries cost the country #2000m a year and victims spend an average
of 39 days off work.
The RAC survey - 1500 vehicles were sampled including 300 in Scotland - found
only 48% of head restraints fitted correctly.
The rest were at the wrong height and would fail to protect a person's neck
from injury in an accident.
Now the motoring organisation has joined European counterparts in demanding
Europe-wide improvements in the fitting, design, and safety standards of head
restraints.
``The RAC is combining a public awareness campaign with a direct call to the
European Commission and motor manufacturers to improve standards of head
restraints across the EU,'' said Ms Nicholson.
``The top of the restraints should be level with the top of the head or at
least no lower than eye level, and the restraint should be as close as possible
to the back of the head.''

THORNTON Gate produced a fine performance at Doncaster at the weekend to give
trainer Peter Easterby his first success in the Sea Pigeon Hurdle.
In the event run in honour of the trainer's dual champion hurdler, the
much-improved Thornton Gate cruised home by four lengths from Star Rage.
Thornton Gate was always travelling easily behind the front-running Stompin and
it was a question of when Lorcan Wyer pressed the button.
Well clear after the last, Wyer eased down and his mount was value for
considerably more than the official winning margin.
``He's pretty good but I don't think he's quite as good as Sea Pigeon yet,''
smiled Easterby. ``I think this is the first time I've won Sea Pigeon's race.
Thornton Gate was in three other races this week but we thought we may as well
go for the prize-money.
``You get a decent race like this and everybody seems to fight shy of it - I
can't understand it.''
Hopes that Star Rage would be good enough to go to Cheltenham next March now
look wide of the mark.
The favourite did not jump fluently and though staying on in the straight was
always facing an uphill struggle.
Easterby and Wyer teed up a double when Scotton Banks proved too good for
Cogent in the `Gaio' Handicap Chase.

<HEADLINE>EIS rejects one-day strikes call Teachers consider alternative measures against funding cuts as delegates snub left</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND's biggest teachers' union has rejected calls for a rolling programme
of industrial action beginning with a one-day strike before Easter.
Delegates attending a special weekend meeting of the Educational Institute of
Scotland agreed with the leadership that going on strike was not the way to
conduct a campaign against underfunding in schools, colleges, and universities.
The substantial vote against strikes was a defeat for the hard left, which had
argued that tough action was needed to fight the funding crisis in Scottish
education.
The vote was welcomed by EIS general secretary Ronnie Smith, who said: ``Once
again, an EIS general meeting has shown its basic good sense.''
He continued, ``There is a lot of strong feeling among teachers, which is not
surprising given the climate of cuts and redundancies.
``The important thing is to channel the anger and strong feeling in a positive
and unifying way.''
Mr Smith said there were difficult times ahead, with the existing local
authorities showing a determination to tackle deficits before they disappeared
in April, and the new councils awaiting news of extremely tough settlements.
During an at times heated debate on the strategy for tackling underfunding, the
supporters of strike action were accused of living in a time warp. A former EIS
president, Western Isles teacher Angus McCormack, said: ``We must demonstrate
that education needs resources not ideology, more teachers not hatchet men,
decent schools to add value, reduced class sizes.
``The campaign must be positive and build its momentum gradually, coherently,
and cogently.'' However, Mr Joe Eyre, president of the College Lecturers'
Association within the EIS, said more than a ``fairly faint-hearted'' publicity
campaign was needed against millions of pounds worth of cuts in the education
budget.
The further education budget faced cuts of more than #30m over the next two
years while about 30 staff at St Andrew's teacher training college in higher
education were being made redundant because of underfunding, he said.
``Nobody in any sector of the service is any longer safe,'' he said.
Delegates heard, however, that teachers in Lothian region, Glasgow, and
Dumfries and Galloway - where up to 40 temporary staff faced redundancy - were
not prepared to go on strike at this stage over underfunding.
They were told that such action would isolate Scottish teachers from parents,
the very people whose support they would need in a campaign for more resources.
The special meeting had been requested by about 5500 petition-signing teachers
but delegates were told that apathy had been the order of the day when local
associations called meetings to discuss the special conference.
Dumfries and Galloway teacher Moira McCrossan said: ``The people who turn up to
meetings are not necessarily representative of people who work in schools.''
The leadership-backed motion includes the option of ``appropriate'' types of
industrial action against cuts and redundancies in the wide-ranging campaign
for more funding.
The union's policy of organising strike ballots against redundancies was
re-affirmed against the wishes of the hard left, which said it had not worked
in further education - although when lecturers at Jewel and Esk Valley college
were balloted over the redundancy of three colleagues, they rejected strike
action.
The hard left also lost votes on organising ballots and strike levies, and on
asking students to boycott classes at universities and colleges proposing
compulsory redundancies.

THE miracle of the pneumonia and the calves goes on. The vet agreed with me
that it was most unusual to get this sort of attack in a closed herd. Usually
these breathing problems occur among herds where every disease known to man is
imported from the markets.
But I assured the vet that we only use the marts to sell into. ``Oh well, that
is unusual - and I don't suppose vaccinating would really be an option for you
as you don't get an annual importation of bugs.''
I was telling the boys about it at the discussion group the other day. ``Aye,
right enough,'' said Big Hamish, ``if you get a problem you usually find it
came from somewhere.'' A born philosopher is Big Hamish. I told them about
those who went in for embryo transplanting just to get twins to give them extra
calves to put onto the cows that lost theirs. That would stop them having to
get a calf from the dairies and make sure they kept their herds disease free.
Then I remembered that pure Simmental that lost its calf this spring. Its milk
had been late in coming in and its calf had become weak and died. We'd got an
awful Holstein calf for it.
That had been a treble mistake. It could never have been a good calf, not
having the bones to hang a good shape on. But worse than that it weaned itself
quietly when on the grass and the cow was ruined with mastitis anyway.
Could it also have been the source of my pneumonia? Surely not. After all,
there had a whole summer to blow away its bugs?
Last Friday, four days into the epidemic, I had decided to pull out another two
bulls for treatment when I saw a cheeky little black face peering nervously
round the back of a red Simmental stot. I don't know how I could have
forgotten. Back in August, when the money from the bumper harvest was on its
way, and it was obvious that I would have plenty of winter keep, did I not go
mad at Thainstone and buy two cows?
One was a Shorthorn that an honest man might call an Ayrshire cross. She was a
decent old cow though I do feel she owes me a good calf in the springtime at
#530. The other was a dun Simmental out of a Friesian, with a good-looking
Limousin bull calf at foot. She looked better value at #930 considering that
the calf would be worth close on #400 before I had to feed his mother.
I dare say she would have been better value had her calf not introduced IBR to
my 22 bull calves.
There is worse. As I stood damning the weather, the government and my luck, I
noticed a bright white ring on the imported calf's eye. The little brute has
ringworm, and that is another disease we haven't seen here for at least 10
years.
I hate ringworm. I've had it myself and it is itchy and sore, but it is not
compassion for the cows that makes me hate it. In the days when we had barley
beef we had it all the time and we also had a huge investment in exotic cattle,
the main market for which was overseas. For that trade they had to be free of
ringworm. One ring could cost you a sale at anything up to #10,000.
Those days are gone and the odd ring doesn't have huge economic impact. I
wouldn't bother at all if we had found it in the spring because sunlight soon
clears it up.
But one ring in a court on the first day of December could be an itchy plague
by the spring day. All 22 could be scratching the ringworm spores into every
available bit of wood in the old byre, laying booby traps for generations of my
calves and the calves of those who follow me.
So what shall I do? My first inclination was to spray some of that blue
antiseptic stuff on the one ring and go to church next Sunday.
But instead I've decided to make it a second test for the new vet. It'll be a
bit like the way men of God in the middle-ages decided whether the unfortunate
accused was a witch or not. I am told they used to throw the suspect into a
deep pool. If she was drowned she was held to be innocent and got a decent
burial with tears. If she floated she was held to be a witch and burned.
That system of justice must have militated against the interests of swimming
teachers.
Anyway, if my vet turns up trumps again, I'll have proved she is the exception
to the rule. If she doesn't manage the business it will justify my prejudice
against young and female vets.
Despite these little problems and the fact that my bones are creaking more and
more as I duck in an out of their pens, I am enjoying the cattle. There is
something warm and reassuring about the cow and its followers. They are
genuinely pleased to see you when you turn up.
So, of course, is a good woman, or a grandchild, say. But they make emotional
demands.
It is not to despise the emotional to say that the beasts are reassuring in
their indifference so long as they are fed.
Farmer's Diary Volume One has now been reprinted despite the expense and the
fact that the house is packed with volumes two to four. The undescriminating

THE Scottish Rugby Union may yet face a challenge to its blueprint for the
immediate future of the game which was unveiled at the weekend. To the dismay
of those clubs which wished to participate in next year's European Cup
competition - most notably Stirling County, Melrose, and Watsonians - the union
has now officially proposed that districts will fly the saltire in Europe.
That has been the union's position since Scotland was first invited to
participate in the spring. The inaugural tournamant is already underway without
Scottish and English representation.
Next season, The Herald understands that European Cup ties will be played at
weekends between October 12 and November 23 with a break to accommodate a tour
by the Wallabies. The final is scheduled provisionally for December 14.
SRU director of rugby Jim Telfer has maintained that only districts are strong
enough to compete in Europe despite a vigorous campaign by the country's
strongest clubs who maintain that, as the traditional bedrock of the Scottish
game, they should be allowed to reap the financial benefits of European
competition and that this would allow them to recruit the personnel necessary
to boost playing strength.
The weekend announcement from Murrayfield is, by happy accident or design,
particularly fortuitous because this week two separate meetings will take place
which might even yet have a bearing on the final outcome of the European issue.
The Premier League Clubs' Association has a scheduled meeting and, perhaps more
significantly, the country's top 10 clubs will meet on Wednesday in an effort
to thrash out a consensus. The SRU having got its retaliation in first, might
now be on sounder ground.
Yesterday, Stirling County president Bill Gibson, who called Wednesday night's
summit, declared: ``This is now a crucial meeting. For the SRU's proposals to
be accepted they must be accepted by the clubs.
``The letter that we have all received from the SRU says that they have
consulted with the clubs. If they have consulted then they have done so on a
very narrow basis.
``If a properly constituted counter proposal comes from the clubs, then I would
have thought there would have to be an extraordinary meeting of the SRU.
``We still think that it should be clubs in Europe but whatever is to be done
will have to be done collectively and with consensus so I don't want to say
more at this stage. However, a counter proposal to what the SRU recommend is
certainly a possibility,'' he said.
Last night, SRU chief executive Bill Hogg, who confirmed that there are three
places available in Europe for Scotland, said that a challenge to the union's
plan would require a counter-proposal from six clubs. ``If that were to happen,
and I hope it wouldn't because we have consulted widely on this issue, then
there would have to be a special meeting of the union when the matter would be
put to all clubs.
``We have consulted with the Premier League Clubs Association, the National
Rugby Clubs Asociation, the districts, and committee members have taken regular
soundings at games. We think that what we have come up with reflects the views
of the vast majority and I would hope that it would not come to a challenge,''
he said.
In the weekend statement which may sound the death-knell for pro-clubs' lobby,
the SRU declared: ``In concluding that district sides should compete in Europe,
the committee has been mindful of its responsibilities to all Scottish clubs,
recognising that the financial benefits of participation should be shared
widely to further develop the game at all levels, rather than see these
benefits concentrated in only a few clubs. This, we believe, is not only
equitable but will help strengthen the overall structure of club rugby in
Scotland - one of the fundamental aims of the SRU.
``The committee is also concerned to provide both a playing and financial
environment in which our most talented players are encouraged to remain in
Scotland; the committee believes that district rather than club participation
in the European Cup provides a better mechanism both for the best players in
the districts selected from a wide range of clubs to play at a higher level -
and therefore providing a necessary stepping stone to international level -
whilst rewarding our leading players.''
Melrose secretary Stuart Henderson declared: ``It is certainly not over yet.
This is supposed to be a discussion document but it has about it an air of
finality as if the union has made up its mind.''
Henderson added: ``When the Premier League Clubs' Association took a vote the
other week, it was 10-9 in favour of clubs in Europe. That decision seems to
have been disregarded by the SRU.
``Nobody is interested in districts. They don't have any traditional support or
grounds. Why try to create something new when everything exists already for the
clubs.
``What we're proposing is that the league champions and runners-up should go
into Europe but the third club - if it is to be three as seems likely - should
be the cup winners. In that way every club has a good chance of getting to
Europe.
``This isn't over yet. The SRU can't just tell us what is going to happen.
There has to be consultation and there has been precious little up until now.''

South 18,
North and Midlands 12
IN an encounter that produced not a single try, South put an end to North's
glory run with a tight performance that prevented their opponents from playing
the effervescent rugby that has produced almost 100 points in their last two
outings.
The match, switched from Poynder Park to the back pitch at Murrayfield, at
least had the benefit of a good running surface but the failure of either side
to produce any degree of continuity in their game play nullified the advantage
of playing at such a fine facility.
At the heart of the problem for both sides was the failure to secure their own
lineout ball. ``The lineout was a mess,'' was the blunt assessment of North and
Midlands coach Ian Rankine, who added: ``Without the platform of lineout
possession you can't play rugby. Overall it was a disappointing game.''
Rankine's North side was hampered by the late withdrawal of Martin Waite, but
more depletion was to follow during the game when the Stirling County and
Scotland prop John Manson was sent off for stamping by referee Johnny
Baccigalupo.
Under the new safety requirements, North and Midlands were then obliged to
``swop'' Brian Ireland for their reserve prop Willie Anderson of Kirkcaldy, one
of the heroes of North's big win over the Samoans at McDiarmid Park last month.
Rankine, however, did not pinpoint the loss of Manson as the main reason for
his side's failure. ``If anything we ran too much from first phase ball and did
not recyle at speed,'' said Rankine, who felt that South had analysed North's
game meticulously. ``They flooded the defence zones and gave us little
chance,'' he added. ``In our last two matches we denied the opposition
possession and as a result had a lot of space to run in. South had done their
homework and shut down our space.''
South captain Craig Chalmers expressed satisfaction with his side's
performance. ``We played some good rugby,'' he said, ``but don't forget that
this was out first district championship match.''
The Borderers could be well satisfied with the contributions of their match
winner Scott Welsh, who kicked six penalty goals from six attempts and moreover
had several encouraging runs from full back suggesting that the experiment of
playing the Hawick stand-off out of position is an enlightened piece of
selectorial thinking.
There were one or two glimpses of Scott Nichol's skills but the Selkirk player
for the most part had to concentrate on stopping the bullocking runs of Paul
Rouse.
Up front, South's best performers were the busy and burrowing Stewart Bennett
and his back row colleague Brian Renwick, who towards the end of the game
emerged as South's most consistent lineout performer.
For the North, Stewart Hamilton took some good lineout ball early in the game
but the understanding between hooker Rob Cairney and his principal jumpers went
awry as the match progressed. Elsewhere, Dave McIvor made his presence felt
with fierce defence and typical charging runs while behind the scrum, the
Stirling half backs, Ken Harper and Mark McKenzie, contrived to be inventive
and at full back, Rowen Shepherd, who looked for options other than a return to
touch, had a try disallowed.
McKenzie's third minute penalty goal gave North an early lead but the stand-off
then failed with a drop goal attempt and then a penalty shot before putting
over his second goal for a 6-0 lead.
When McKenzie succeeded with his third goal, it looked as though North would
repeat their victory over South of last season but two well struck penalty
kicks from Welsh brought South right back into the game.
A ruck offence cost North another three points as Welsh struck once again but a
fourth penalty by McKenzie tilted the balance yet again. That was to be North's
final points as Welsh continued to turn South pressure into points with three
further penalty goals.
Scotland's selectors, having not got a great deal of information from this
match, will have to wait until this competition - almost certainly the last of
its type - reaches the later stages. By then one fancies that the South could
be on their way to restoring standards of old.

<HEADLINE>Fishermen welcome move on reporting catches</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH fishermen have ``wholeheartedly'' welcomed the announcement by
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth that they will no longer have to radio in
catch reports when entering western waters    across the four degree west line.
In a letter to Mr Robert Allan, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's
Federation, Mr Forsyth made it clear that the decision, agreed with other
fisheries departments, had been made in the interests of reducing the burden on
fishermen.
He said that in ending the requirement they recognised the western waste
regulations would place a reporting obligation on all EC fishermen from January
1 and they had decided no additional hailing would be necessary.
Mr Forsyth added: ``You will appreciate, of course, that our concern to
discourage and detect misreporting offences remains as strong as ever.
``That is why the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency has focused considerable
efforts on detecting such offences by means of a detailed check of logbook
entries against recorded sightings made by the SPFA aircraft and Fisheries
Protection Vessels.''
Mr Allan said: ``Scottish fishermen have long viewed these requirements as
burdensome, costly, and, above all, wholly discriminatory in that they have not
applied to fishermen of any other state, community or otherwise when operating
in the waters on either side of the line.
``This matter was brought sharply into focus during the recent negotiations
arising from changes under which Spanish and Portuguese vessels will fish in
western waters from January 1.
``In particular, the fact that the Spanish are to be relieved then of their
current requirement to report catch on board has caused renewed aggravation
amongst Scottish fishermen and added a strong impetus to our case for equality
of treatment.''
q.The first of a new class of stern trawler to be designed and built at
Lithgow's yard in Campbeltown was named there on Saturday.
The 25.5-metre trawler, which was built for George Moodie &amp; Sons Trawlers Ltd,
incorporates the latest advances in navigation, electronics, and communications
technology and has a high standard of accommodation for its crew of 10.
Mrs Jenny Moodie named the trawler the Shemarah II.

Raith Rovers 1, Hearts 1
RAITH Rovers manager Jimmy Nicholl was presented with the Bell's Manager of the
Month award for November before Saturday's match against Hearts, but even this
early in December he knows he will not be picking up the next prize if his side
maintans their current mood.
Rovers, who shot to their highest ever place in the top division with a bit of
style last month, are misfiring at present and that was heavily underlined when
they failed to beat a side which was eventually reduced to nine men. In fact,
they could have lost all three points, just as they did the previous week when
they flopped against Falkirk.
Said Nicholl: ``It was a battle right from the start and our lads stood up to
that quite well, but, even against nine men, never mind 10, we didn't put
enough thought into our game. That was very disappointing.
``When Hearts were reduced to nine men with about quarter of an hour to go we
should have shown more composure and got good crosses into their box. We didn't
do that, and to think Hearts might have gone away with three points, but for a
great stop by our keeper Scott Thomson near the end. That's a sad reflection on
our players.''
One player, who did escape criticism, however, was debut boy Mark Humphries,
who stood in for central defender Shaun Dennis. The former Aberdeen and Bristol
City player almost never put a foot wrong. Almost? Well it was a dreadful
mistake by him which let in Hearts' Hans Eskilsson for that late chance and it
was his clumsy tackle which led to the Tynecastle side's equaliser.
Apart from those lapses the lad did well and, most important, Nicholl thought
so. ``He was excellent,'' said the manager. ``I was very impressed with his
temperament and attitude.''
Despite his mistakes, Humphries was named as Rovers' man of the match while
Gary Locke, one of the men sent off, was named as Hearts best player. It was
that kind of day when controversy abounded. I doubt if anyone connected with
the clubs, especially Hearts, noticed how bitterly cold it was. You could tell
that by the steam coming out of their ears.
Raith took the lead after 27 minutes when Steve Crawford was pulled down by
Neil Berry. Referee Mike Pocock awarded the penalty, sent off Berry, and Danny
Lennon scored from the spot.
At half-time, Hearts manager Jim Jefferies had angry words with the referee,
but he must have been even angrier after 52 minutes when, in what was almost an
action replay of the penalty incident, Humphries pulled down John Robertson.
This time the referee showed the Raith player the yellow card, then ran across
the field to consult his linesman before deciding the tackle had taken place
just outside the box. While his team-mates fumed, Robertson kept his cool and
blasted in the equaliser from the free kick.
With 10 men Hearts were the better side and made the better chances, but with
14 minutes to go they were reduced to nine when Locke was ordered off following
a clash with Tony Rougier. Even at that the Tynecastle men looked more composed
than the home side.

JUNIORS
CAMELON, the OVD Scottish Junior Cup holders, have an added incentive to get
through their delayed third-round replay against Darvel.
Victory this week would win them a fourth-round tie against 1994 cup winners
Largs Thistle.
Indeed, junior club supporters can look forward to a number of outstanding
clashes. Two interesting Ayrshire/Central ties from yesterday's draw are
Kilsyth Rangers v Glenafton, and Cumnock v Pollok.
Stonehaven face a difficult visit to Glasgow to meet Petershill, playing this
season under former Dumbarton manager Jim George.
The surprise result of the cup replays was Kilbirnie's 2-1 defeat by Inverurie
Loco. Loco had a sensational start to the game going ahead in the third minute
when striker George Reid's long-range shot slipped through keeper Strachan's
arm and into the net.
Ladeside immediately pressed but found Loco's keeper Christie in excellent
form. As the game progressed, Ladeside became devoid of ideas against a defence
brilliantly marshalled by ex-Manchester City sweeper Bobby McDonald.
With five minutes left Loco's Jim Finlay scored a second, putting the tie
beyond Ladeside's reach. Substitute Scott Reid scored a last-minute consolation
for Kilbirnie, but it was a case of too little too late.
Loco will meet St Andrews at home in the fourth round.
In the all-Central replay, Arthurlie comfortably disposed of Yoker with goals
from Rocky Chrichton and Billy McClafferty, who also missed a second-half
penalty.
Whitburn were rewarded with a home tie against Arthurlie in the next round of
the cup after beating Arbroath in their replay. It was Arbroath who led 1-0 at
half-time. However, Whitburn ran out worthy winners with second-half goals from
Priory, McPhee and Nicol.
Two second-half goals from Irvine Meadow's Ally Fraser gave them a share of the
points against Dalry Thistle and helped them move to joint top spot in the
Western Stagecoach first division.
Cumnock carried out a demolition job on Kilwinning, one of their main league
adversaries. They went ahead in the thirteeth minute when Norman Montgomery
knocked the ball into the path of left back Gary Agnew, who scored from 18
yards.
They extended their lead in the nineteenth minute when Chris Wilson headed
home. Montgomery was the architect again when his rebound from keeper Adams was
knocked in by Chris Wilson to make it 3-0.
Wilson completed his hat trick in the second half and substitute Robert Irving
made it five from the spot.
The Pollok-Benburb game was the only Reebok Premier League game to beat the
weather. In a disappointing game, Pollok led 2-0 with goals from Gary Faulds
and Paul McGrogan. Neil Diamond scored late on for the Bens.
OVD Cup fourth-round draw:
Carnoustie v Kirkintilloch Rob Roy; Baillieston or Tayport v Stoneywood; Irvine

WITH no action in division one, Ardrossan Accies benefited from the only game
in division two to push up from the lower end of the table thanks to a 17-9
home win. Opponents Howe of Fife were left wondering when they will get the
kind bounce and lonely at the bottom. They led 9-8 at the turn but Mark Hogarth
took his penalty count to four thereafter. In a scrappy game Robert Bradford
scored Ardrossan's try from close range.
A 21-3 home win for Berwick over Leith Accies, their twelfth in as many
outings, keeps them at the top of division three. Sticking to the polished
formula of tight forward play based on their solid front row and big
touch-kicks from stand-off Peter Thompson, Berwick scored a try in each half
through pack members Willie Arton and John Simmons.
Allan Glen's beat Cumbernauld 28-0 to stay in second place while Alloa closed
on third club and idle Cartha QP, with a 52-19 home win over bottom club North
Berwick.
Glen's led 21-0 at the break with tries from Chris Hughes and Paul McCormack.
Stand-off Hugh Letham broke three tackles for the second half touchdown.
Alistair Robertson converted two and kicked three penalties.
Alloa scored eight tries through Edgar Wallace (two), Gary Matheson (two),
Gordon Sneddon, Stuart Greenhill, Bryce Lamont and Steven Cass, but with most
coming in the closing stages.
Division four's only game allowed Hillfoots to drag themselves into the middle
of the table at the expense of joint bottom Irvine. Neil Davis and Colin
Waddell both scored two tries in their 44-10 success.
Busy division five has a new leader, on points difference, Ross High having won
39-3 at home to Murrayfield. The latter find themselves alone on the second
bottom rung following Earlston's 27-26 win at Aberdeen University.
High have come on to form after a quiet start. Three penalties from Garry
Inglis plus tries from Mark Urwin, Mike McNeill, John Tinlin and John Reynolds
gave them a 29-3 interval lead. Two minutes later Grant Scott went over. Then
they went to sleep until three minutes from the end Tinlin awoke to grab his
second.
Greenock Wanderers won the derby with Marr 34-9. The visitors, having doubled
their wins the week before, arrived looking for a third and led 6-0 after five
minutes. However, Wanderers were 9-6 up by the pause, thanks to penalties from
Paul Morton. Thereafter inconsistent Greenock got on top with further
touchdowns form Richard Barclay, up the blind side, and Graham Knox, off a
chargedown.

STRANGE music is pumping up through the floorboards of Jeremy Isaacs's office,
sending the tumblers on the table into a bit of a seance twitch. Well, perhaps
not strange music exactly, but unexpected because this is the lair of the Royal
Opera House's general director, and these trespassing rhythms are more in
keeping with the rock-a-buy stridency of funky fashion boutiques.
On the wall a television monitor keeps watch over Covent Garden rehearsals
across the road. High Cs versus Muzak, then, battling it out to the very last
bar in the neutral beige and yellows of Isaacs's den. For a moment he holds his
brow as if fending off a migraine and then, with exasperated weariness, he
sprawls in a black leather armchair.
Adding to the bedlam downstairs there are now the hammer-blows of carpentry.
``Sorry about this,'' he says, ``but our opera house is so broke we've had to
clear out from the floor below and let the space to retailers in order to raise
some cash. Somebody has the shopfitters in.''
But an element of din has always surrounded Isaacs. Three decades in British
television earned him unrivalled prestige as one of the industry's true
individualists, a man whose talent as programme-maker and producer actually
matched his daring; an individual who never shrank from controversy or the
demanding, sometimes ambushed slog for excellence.
They say that when Isaacs was up for the BBC director-general's job in 1987 the
board observed that he didn't much seem like a chap who took kindly to
discipline. That comment probably says more about the BBC today than it does
about him. Intellectually there is no-one more committed and disciplined than
Isaacs, but it is true that the Beeb's great trundling bureaucracy would have
driven him to distraction.
Since then Isaacs's restless spirit has resided in Covent Garden's Floral
Street, flitting between the theatre's premises on either side of the road.
From there he manages two of the most internationally distinguished opera and
ballet companies, and of course the winds of contention still swirl.
Last summer they reached gale force with the announcement of his booty from the
National Lottery, a sum so mighty it will allow the Royal Opera House to embark
on the radical rebuilding it has postponed for 30 years because of the wretched
state of its finances. But if the win guarantees Covent Garden's assured
entrance into the 21st century, it has turned Isaacs into culture's number one
demon for the barbarians at the gate.
Predictably, the ``tabs'' howl loudest, decrying him as the man who has
snatched from the poor to gratify the rich.
He believes that the outrage is artificial, the result either of ``a synthetic
philistinism'' foisted on the public by the tabloids, or of an anger stoked by
jealousy from less lucky colleagues in the arts. But first, rather
mischievously, he wants to set things straight: ``That sum we're getting is not
the #55m everybody quotes, but actually #75m.'' Suddenly, a look of humour
brightens the grave expression, anticipating another round of contrived
bombardment. ``The total will come in two tranches, the second dependent on
meeting certain conditions. So far we haven't got our hands on any of it, by
the way.''
But Isaacs, a rare left-winger in opera circles, does concede that the
presentation of windfalls to the five eligible strands in the Lottery's
structure - the arts, sport, charities, heritage and the millennium - should
have been handled more sensitively. ``Much of the anger seems to be because we
were among the first recipients but the Government could have avoided all that
by saying it wanted the first #10m to go to children with leukaemia, for
instance; the second to those who need nursing care at home; and the third to a
third-division football team.
``Charities say they have lost money because of the Lottery, and I can't
quarrel with that - they know their business. But what is being forgotten is
that everyone will eventually catch up. These things just take time.''
What also irritates, however, is Isaacs's nippiness in getting his application
processed so fast. ``Well, my answer there is that it would have been reckless
for the future of this House if we hadn't been on the doorstep the minute
applications were due.''
For other arts organisations, like Scottish Opera sinking ever faster into the
quicksands of penury, Isaacs's success carries a bitter-sweet refrain. His own
view of the situation up here is shaped by his hard, continual fight at Covent
Garden to uphold quality while reducing costs.
``The most desirable option for Scottish Opera must be to hold its company
together throughout the year and not cut back on its work, otherwise it will
lose impetus. But the orchestra is underemployed, and that has to be addressed.
Personally, music-making and the love of music are very much part of my
experience of city life in Scotland, and the reputation of Scottish Opera for
world-class work is evidence of that. The skill and vision of Sir Alexander
Gibson and others were really quite remarkable.
``But with opera and ballet you can never rest on your laurels. You must
constantly be seeking new audiences with outreach projects, small-scale
productions, coaching and participation workshops with schools. I know Scottish
Opera and Scottish Ballet believe in this approach, also. All our children are
entitled to a first-class education in the arts, and Scotland, like Denmark and
Portugal, ought to be able to sustain such companies.''
But if it can't, what does that tell us about society? ``Well, it lets us know
a country has other priorities. Yet, as I know from the work of this House, you
can go into the most deprived school, put on a series of tiny performances, and
a class will be transformed by interest, with children dancing to bits of the
Magic Flute, or pretending to be the dragon slayed by Siegfried.''
For Isaacs, the arts are not some indulgent appendage to life but part of the
brickwork. He quotes a line from Humperdinck's opera, Hansel and Gretel: `Oh
touch me, too, that I may see the world anew.'
``That's sung to Hansel and Gretel by the children already turned into
gingerbread by the witch, and I just think the words are a marvellous metaphor
for civilisation, and what the arts can achieve for all of us. If we could have
more of that, then people would be less likely to condemn opera as
extravagance.''
Despite the grandeur and glamour of its veneer, the Royal Opera House is
falling apart. It was built in 1858 and the last time the stage was refurbished
was at the turn of the century; the wiring alone hasn't been replaced for 30
years. Apart from reducing the hefty and much condemned ticket prices, the
Lottery money will go towards a #150m plan to gut the theatre's interior and
create three auditoria, all to be ready by the year 2000. But redevelopment
will not commence until 1997 when the opera and ballet companies will be
shunted into some temporary abode. And by the time they traipse back to Floral
Street, Isaacs will no longer be their supremo.
``Like Moses, I will get to see the promised land but I won't be there to enter
it. I'm getting on a bit now and I intend to leave in the summer of 1997 when
I'll be 65.''
Isaacs, small and chunky in build, vividly animated in conversation but solemn
in repose, was born into middle-class Glasgow where his father was a jeweller
and his mother a doctor. Contemporaries at Oxford, where he studied at Merton,
recall that Isaacs was an obsessive concert-goer.
After National Service in the Highland Light Infantry, he went straight into
television, producing for Granada, then editing Panorama for three years before
becoming features controller at Thames. Later he founded Channel 4 where his
instinct for creative and high-profile risks brought more clashes with the
old-guard mentality. But by the time he left in the late-eighties Isaacs was
well established as the victor of his enemies. And that, pretty much, is how it
has also been at Covent Garden.
In 1992 he was said to have fallen out with both the Arts Council and the Arts
Minister of the day, David Mellor, when a commissioned report suggested the
Royal Opera House was run ``with incredible amateurism''. Yet Isaacs has  taken
on the unions, cut operating costs, and reduced the accumulated deficit of
#3.6m to nearer #1m.
Latterly he has also presided over of a run of widely acclaimed productions,
with audiences approaching 90% capacity. ``Getting by on limited means is a
genuinely stimulating artistic challenge, but I can't tell you the pain we've
endured trying to balance the books. Our most lavish productions cost a tiny
fraction of those in Milan, New York, or Vienna. But if you are doing a new
version of one of the classical ballets like Swan Lake, then you are talking
about five to six different casts, each member of which must have a costume
tailored with infinite precision to her measurements. One swan's tutu alone
will cost around #300.''
So, on reflection, is the mayhem of television preferable? ``I really don't
have any regrets about not being at the centre of that world any longer, but
having said that I've been asked to supervise a series on the Cold War, and I
enjoy my Interview stints with the BBC. I suppose there is a kind of narrowness
about this job. As much as I love opera and ballet at their best, they do
occasionally come down to whether somebody has a sore throat or a sore toe.
Television, especially news and current affairs, seems to touch life at more
points than that.''
By now the downstairs clatter seems exhausted, allowing Isaacs, whose first
wife died of cancer, and who is now married to a former arts editor of the
Observer, to bound back about his business. There are administrative matters to
complete, rehearsals to observe, performances to attend, then perhaps guest
artists to entertain, or sponsors to cajole over late-night supper. The eye for
detail and the wooing of patrons never rest.
Outside in Floral Street, a member of the wardrobe staff scurries across the
road with a gorgeous outfit on her arm. As she reaches the stage door she
collides with a messenger, and there is the sharp sound of ripping silk. What
was it Isaacs said about the price of a single costume? That Lottery lolly
might seem like a happy ending, but times must have been less stressful all
round when money wasn't the polluting engine of everything.

THE European Commission is poised to move against the Italian Government for
failing to respect EU employment law in universities.
A long-running campaign led by Professor David Petrie, who comes from
Dumbarton, against victimisation by university employers in Italy now looks
like succeeding after the Italian president, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, last week
denounced discrimination against foreign workers as a ``disgrace''.
Professor Petrie is a language lecturer in the University of Verona and
chairman of the Committee for the Defence of Foreign Lecturers. His group
represents many lecturers from EU states who have been demoted and forced to
accept wage cuts while Italian colleagues have been promoted and paid more.
The committee's campaign to end illegal discrimination by the Italian
authorities has been supported twice by the European Court of Justice and has
led to the European Commission threatening proceedings against Italy for
flouting EU law on mutual recognition of qualifications.
In the past few weeks, some of the foreign lecturers have been ``reclassified''
by the Italian authorities as technicians or non-teachers - a ruse to justify
cutting their pay. At the same time, the salaries of native teachers have been
increased.
One foreigner has been sacked and others threatened with internal disciplinary
procedures after continuing their campaign of protest.
Mr Hugh McMahon, Labour Euro-MP for Strathclyde West, said last night: ``I will
be raising this affair again this week in Strasbourg with Mr Padraig Flynn, the
European social affairs commissioner. It seems the pressure is paying off.
``Now we see that the president of Italy does not want this affair to tarnish
the Italian presidency of the EU, which begins next month. The Italians should
repeal their unfair labour laws and let their action match their rhetoric about
European union.''
President Scalfaro's re-mark was made during a meeting with an employees'
delegation at the University of Florence.
A Commission representative travelled to Italy last week to investigate the
plight of foreigners working in universities there and is expected to report to
Brussels soon. Legal action is widely expected against Italy and other EU
member states who are known to be ignoring EU labour laws or have not yet fully
written it into their own domestic law.

WORLDWIDE ROUND-UP
JAPAN will rely heavily on the appliance of science in their bid to stage the
World Cup finals in 2002.
Spokesman Jim Trecker revealed that Japan would create a ``The Virtual
Stadium'' for the finals to allow four million fans to see matches live.
The Virtual Stadium concept would convert grounds not being used into
three-dimensional theatres with gigantic 80 x 35-metre dome-shaped screens
carrying 3-D pictures of games.
``This is a pioneering project which can be used worldwide for matches taking
place elsewhere,'' Trecker said.
He added that cash raised would be put into a trust fund for FIFA to develop
the sport during the twenty-first century.
Former England international Sir Bobby Charlton, who is backing Japan's bid,
said the growth of soccer in Japan had been mind-boggling since the creation
two years ago of the professional J-League.
``Japan 2002 will probably be the greatest sporting event ever held,'' he said.
South Korea also, are competing for the 2002 finals, the first held in Asia.
FIFA will decide the venue next June.
q.FAUSTINO Asprilla scored a cheeky, back-heeled goal yesterday to set
second-placed Parma on their way to a 2-1 win over Lazio and keep the pressure
on league leaders AC Milan.
The temperamental Colombian struck in the thirty-seventh minute before
Gianfranco Zola's free-kick stretched Parma's unbeaten league run to 10 matches.
Champions Juventus suffered their fourth defeat of the season, going down 2-0
at Sampdoria.
Fiorentina tightened their grip on third place with a 3-0 win over Udinese.
Croat Goran Vlaovic, playing only his second match since undergoing brain
surgery in September, scored both Padova goals in a 2-1 win over
Internazionale.
Eugenio Fascetti's dream return to serie A as manager of Bari proved a
nightmare as his side rashed 7-1 at Cremonese.
q.TWO early goals by Bulgarian Luboslav Penev helped Spanish league leaders
Atletico Madrid to a resounding 3-1 victory over second-placed Barcelona. In
the only other match played on Saturday, Valencia scored a comfortable 3-0 win
away to Racing Santander.
q.FRENCH league leaders Paris St Germain ran riot at the Parc des Princes on
Saturday with a resounding 5-0 victory over champions Nantes.
Auxerre stayed third despite a 2-1 home defeat by Monaco for whom Brazilian
Sonny Anderson and Michael Madar found the net.
q.BORUSSIA Dortmund clinched three vital points with a lucky 1-0 victory at
Freiburg to take a two-point lead into the German first division's winter
break. Bayern Munich won 2-0 away to relegation-threatened Fortuna Duesseldorf.

WE all know that Glasgow has an underworld, but until Friday night, I didn't
know that the city was cluttered with closet cowboys and cowgirls, eager for
any opportunity to strut their stilettos, parade their pointy-toed boots, and
flounce their frills. One such opportunity arose at the Plaza last week when
the old ballroom was transformed into a veritable cow-person convention, as
gunslingers from all over the west descended on Eglinton Toll for an evening of
ritual.
The ritual in question was that of ``Western Line Dancing''. This, according to
the blurb, is the latest dance sensation to sweep the nation. Never even having
heard of it, I was entitled to feel dubious about that claim but after
witnessing 1000 bodies of all ages - and all shapes and sizes - perform routine
after routine like rows of seasoned chorus girls, I'd have to concede that it
has definitely caught the imagination of a large cross-section of the
population. Friday night's get-together was the result of the enthusiasm of a
pair of country and western fans from Coatbridge - Helen and Tom Wills.
Earlier this year, the couple began to give weekly Western Line classes in
Coatbridge, Paisley, and Govanhill, and it was the members of these classes who
formed the core of the dancers on Friday; the rest were friends, family and
busloads of groups from Country and Western clubs around Glasgow.
The abundance of gun-totin' cowboys ranged in influence from The Wild Bunch
through to Roy Rogers (Trigger had the night off). Some looked like Mexican
cowboys or spaghetti western baddies; a frightening contingent of younger
dancers resembled Milky Bar Kids; and many of the women were wearing their own
variations of Jane Russell's Outlaw clobber. There was also a General Custer
lookalike, who danced in a stately manner appropriate to his rank; and a
drunken cowboy whose swagger would have been more convincing had it not been so
reminiscent of M Hulot's walk.
Many of the guys had adopted cowboy names to go with their cowboy apparel.
Montana Peter is a plumber from Strathaven; Flint McCulloch's day job is motor
vehicle maintenance man in East Kilbride, and Cisco Mitchell is a spritely
69-year-old who makes his own cowboy clothes. One civvies-sporting cowboy I
spotted lurking in the wings was Matt McPhilemy - shamefaced because his wife,
Greta, hadn't allowed him to wear his cowboy hat on the bus over from Toryglen.
After experiencing the friendly atmosphere of the Western Liners, it's easy to
appreciate why this dance is so popular as a social occasion. You can go in a
group or you can go on your own, because you don't need a partner - something
that suits most of the men, who prefer to drink and listen to the music without
being dragged onto the dance floor. The only drawback as far as I was concerned
was that a liking for Country and Western music would have been helpful .....

A FEMALE member of the Falkirk entourage slipped a consoling arm around the
shoulder of John Lambie prior to the Falkirk manager taking his leave of Rugby
Park on Saturday. These are indeed trying times for the Brockville leader.
Of course, the idea of a club managed by Lambie being close to the foot of a
division is far from novel. He was well used to that when in charge of Partick
Thistle. However, this present lot, although perhaps more gifted than some who
pulled on a Thistle jersey in difficult circumstances, do not appear to have
the same appetite for the task which lies before them and to Lambie and his
club's followers this is a worrying situation.
Falkirk popped down to North Ayrshire at the weekend for a kickabout with
Kilmarnock, who, before the ball started bouncing were plumb last in the
premier table. And well before a halt was called, with the home lot operating
on cruise control, the pathetically poor away support were informing their
manager that perhaps it would be best for all concerned if he were to seek
employment elsewhere.
Lambie was kind to his men when describing their performance as ``shambolic.''
However, some were in more disarray than others.
Picture the scene. David Hagen, his team two down courtesy of Tom Brown, is
just yards out, the goal at his mercy, and he shoots wide. That was bad enough.
Ten minutes later and with no-one around for miles, Hagen contrives to miss the
target from inches, a feat David Copperfield may have found difficulty matching.
``I had too many players out there who didn't work hard enough,'' said Lambie,
and the worrying aspect of all of this is that the manager admitted to not
having an answer to the situation.
Naturally enough when the Falkirk fans were pointing and chanting at their
team's leader, Kilmarnock's people were having a ball, singing, cheering and
rightly making merry.
Indeed, Kilmarnock were so impressive that even their normally straight-faced
manager Alex Totten almost managed a smile.
He said that his side cannot afford to give away ``silly goals'' as they had
been doing so Totten was ``pleased with this clean sheet.
``We emphasised to the players before the game just how important this match
was,'' said the manager, ``and they went about their business in a thoroughly
professional manner.''
After Brown had warmed the audience with his double it was left to two
defenders to rub salt in Falkirk's wound with Tom Black converting a penalty
just after the interval and Gus McPherson belting the ball home after good work
by Paul Wright.
No doubt as the season further unfolds other consoling gestures will be aimed
in Lambie's direction, that is, of course, unless his players start earning
their keep.
What better place to do that than against Celtic at Parkhead on Saturday. Then
again, to be realistic, you could always put your money on the Glasgow side
recording their biggest success of the season so far. Excuse me, I'm off to the
bookies.
Kilmarnock 4, Falkirk 0

DUNBARTONSHIRE Enterprise today is lodging a bid with the Millennium Commission
for funding to build a hi-tech interpretation centre at Balloch, associated
footpath and cycle-ways, and the relaunch of the Maid of the Loch paddle
steamer.
If the outline proposal is accepted by the commission, the local enterprise
company will make a formal application for up to #15m in the commission's 1996
funding round.
Mr Nick Cowie, the Lec's communications manager, said: ``Dunbartonshire
Enterprise believes the Loch Lomond Millennium Project will become the flagship
of a linked master plan for the area between the loch and the urban communities
of West Dunbartonshire.
``It will help boost the fortunes of the area, which suffers pockets of
unemployment as high as 25%. It will lever in #42.5m in public and
private-sector investment, unlock a potential visitor spend of #100m, and help
create up to 4000 new jobs in Scotland.''
Under the proposal, the new visitor centre will be called Loch Lomond
Landscapes and will be sited at Drumkinnon Bay, the 76-acre site at Balloch
bought recently by Dunbartonshire Enterprise.
The Drumkinnon site already has attracted interest from private developers but
the Lec believes its vision to create a world-class tourist attraction goes far
beyond anything that could be funded by the private sector.
The proposal is being supported by community groups and the new unitary
authority.
Mr Cowie said Dunbartonshire Enterprise wanted to finally achieve the vision of
creating a gateway to the Highlands and a great reception point for tourists
and local visitors.
``The whole strategy is to make people stop and stay in the Loch Lomond area
and, hopefully, spend money in shops and hotels,'' he said.
Loch Lomond Landscapes, which will look on to the loch, will inform visitors
about the environmental and resource issues which affect the area.
Under the scheme, the Lec also proposes a visitor management scheme, called The
Crossing of the Ways, linking the visitor centre to the neighbouring
communities and the A82 Highland Road, which currently carries five million
people past the loch every year.
This would involve creating ``the High Road'', a foot and cycle bridge across
the River Leven to Balloch Castle Country Park, thus meeting the demands of
local people for better access to the area, and ``the Low Roads'', a series of
footpaths connecting the centre to the bridge across to the country park,
creating continuous loch-side access to sections of the Millennium Forest and
the National Millennium Cycleway.
Mr Cowie said the aim was to get visitors out of their cars and using bicycles
or ``Shanks's pony'' instead.
Other features of the proposal include the restoration of the Maid of the Loch
paddle steamer, thus creating a major plank in the visitor management of the
loch, and the restoration of the once bonnie banks of Drumkinnon Bay, where the
land meets the loch, with a replanting scheme.
The Maid of the Loch, which has not sailed since 1981, was handed over
officially last week by Dumbarton District Council to a trust fund which will
now actively pursue her restoration.
Mr David Hastings, director of Development at Dunbartonshire Enterprise, who is
heading the Loch Lomond Project, said: ``We hope the Millennium Commission will
assist us to implement our vision for Loch Lomond. When completed, the project
will help reconcile conflicts of interest which have afflicted the loch for the
past 50 years.''
q.It is also hoped that cash from the European Regional Development Fund will
attract an extra #10m of tourist spending on Loch Lomondside next year, with
#250,000 going on a marketing campaign aimed at 150 million people in the UK,
Ireland, and Germany.

Aileen Little examines a scheme providing company and homes for the elderly
TONY Newton, leader of the House of Commons does it; Prince Charles and Dame
Judi Dench frequently do it; and, on the quiet, numerous MPs do it too. They
all make time, away from the limelight, to visit their local Abbeyfield house.
The Abbeyfield solution to loneliness in old age was established 40 years ago
by Guards officer Richard Carr-Gomm. After the war, he bought three small
houses and arranged for isolated elderly people in his parish to live in them,
family style, receiving care and companionship. The concept was further
developed by a group of Christian Guards officers who believed Abbeyfields
should be focal points of goodwill in their neighbourhoods.
Despite the organisation's astonishing growth - 1000 UK houses run by 600
Abbeyfield Societies and 12,000 volunteers, plus houses in 10 countries
overseas - the movement isn't well known. Raising awareness is something the
new chairman of Abbeyfield National Society UK, Shena Robertson Cole, is keen
to address. The first woman to hold the position, and the first Scot, she
served the organisation at every level for 36 years, earning an OBE.
During her term of office (initially two years) she has to chair some 14
executive meetings at Society HQ in St Albans. ``I'm inundated with
invitations,'' says Robertson Cole, wife of a retired canon.
Abbeyfield is split into 17 UK regions (of which Scotland is one), each served
by a voluntary chairman who sits on the national board. Each house (Edinburgh
established the first in Scotland and now has 22) is run by a committee of up
to 20 volunteers in a local society, nearly three-quarters of which are
registered as housing associations and which are supported by professionals at
regional and national levels.
The formula - very sheltered housing for mobile people with low to medium
dependency - seems to work. Of all the options open to senior citizens who no
longer wish to live alone or with their children, few can match Abbeyfield's
balance of privacy (single, usually en suite rooms, for no more than 10
residents) combined with family atmosphere.
A resident housekeeper provides two cooked meals a day to which friends -
including MPs, local clergy etc - are invited to join round a large table.
Communal activities like whist and Scrabble are hugely popular. ``The committee
keeps the place lively and part of the community. Our residents inherit a whole
society of people personally dedicated to them,'' says Robertson Cole.
The Abbeyfield life isn't suited to everyone, of course. As in any real family,
sly disruptors can undermine harmony. Newcomers can be made to feel unwelcome.
``Sometimes people have to be moved out - I have no rose-coloured spectacles
about residents,'' explains Robertson Cole. ``I'm a great believer in
cultivating tolerance and courtesy in middle years - it stands us in good
stead.''
On the other side of the coin, she is critical of the way the rest of us
perceive old age. ``On the inside, you are the same person as you always were.
Never make concessions just because of age.''
Robertson Cole herself admits only to being ``over 60''. She is forthright
(``Our residents like it that way''); she is a former senior subaltern in the
ATS; by mutual consent, she took no part in her husband's church work; and she
reckons that, as a woman, she contributes to her task simply what any good
chairman should bring - a wealth of past experience.
That experience is now helping to guide the Abbeyfield movement in a new
direction. Increasingly, emphasis is being placed on bringing care to the
resident, rather than on moving the resident on to the care. Societies are
being encouraged to upgrade houses to provide specialist facilities such as
assisted baths, lifts and wheelchair access.
Some societies are even providing facilities specifically for residents who
develop Alzheimer's or arthritis - each society controls its own budget and may
instigate building, with access to regional and national funding.
Those at the helm of Abbeyfield UK are confident the organisation's change of
direction will better serve the 3,500,000 older people who will be living alone
by the year 2011.
By the next century, those of pensionable age will form the single largest
section of the population. Robertson Cole welcomes her opportunity to
contribute to an end product Abbeyfield can be proud of. ``My aim is to draw
the movement together, keeping in mind that the community Abbeyfield creates is
the one we shall all inherit.''

Hamilton 2, Morton 3
MORTON striker Warren Hawke was resting yesterday after one of the most
worrying moments of his football career.
Hawke was stretchered off after 22 minutes and it was with relief that his
team-mates later saw him walking.
Coach John McMaster said yesterday: ``Warren got a knock in the centre of his
back. He suffered a spasm and could not walk correctly.
``Our doctor and physio both worked on him and it gradually eased off.
``It was with considerable relief that we saw him moving about later, but it
was just baby steps that he was taking.
``A close watch will be kept on him this week to make sure that he recovers
completely.''
Hawke said: ``I just seemed to catch a knock in the middle of my back. I could
not move for half-an-hour because of the pain even though I had a pain-killing
injection. But the doctor told me it was muscular and that I would need to
start getting about so that it did not stiffen up. There is going to be a some
bruising and I will continue to get treatment.''
This was yet another scare for a club which in recent weeks has had their
manager, Allan McGraw, rushed to hospital during a game, pronounced fit and
well, and then had to learn that he had suffered a heart attack.
But, to their credit, everyone at the club has rallied round and even without
Derek McInnes are now just one point behind league leaders Dunfermline.
It seemed at one stage that the Greenock side were cruising to victory as Derek
Collins, Derek Lilley, and John Anderson had given them a comfortable
three-goal lead by the hour mark.
But Hamilton came close to saving a point with Gary Clark and Raymond McStay
both netting.
Assistant manager Peter Cormack had read the signs correctly and he admitted:
``We were two up at the interval and had not played at all. I can possibly give
pass marks to Lilley, Marko Rajamaki, and Derek Laing when he came on, but that
is it. The rest were passengers. We were just not sharp. The result was good,
but not the performance.
``Perhaps I am going over the top, it is just that I know how well we can play.
And there has been a touch of flu about the club this week. In fact, Janne
Lindberg and Alan Mahood were not able to train on Thursday.''
But it was yet another disappointment for struggling Hamilton and manager Iain
Munro.
``When you are at the bottom the breaks go against you. But we are not willing
to accept our fate,'' he said. ``We are still capable of catching those above
us if we keep playing good football.''

With the City of Architecture and Design 1999 director revealed today, Clare
Henry asks if Glasgow can match its title
DOES design matter? Can it influence Glasgow's future? Can Glasgow become a
driving force in British design and architecture? Will it produce the goods?
Later today we should learn which of five candidates gets the key #65,000 job
as director of Glasgow, UK City of Architecture and Design 1999. It's vital we
get a good 'un. The city's future rests on their shoulders.
However, the job could be a poisoned chalice. Despite the huge commitment from
individuals and organisations during the run-up to the bid, in the 14 months
since Glasgow won things have gone dead. A great many people now feel
disillusioned and disenfranchised, as arrangements for 1999 hiccup in a stop,
slow, no-go way.
Moreover, despite the fact Glasgow won the 1999 award mainly because of its
focus on design, there is little design input.
``No design advisors are involved and there is no forum for contributions to
1999. It's an untenable position,'' says Janice Kirkpatrick, of Graven Images
fame.
Kirkpatrick is one of the high-flying, internationally known Glasgow School of
Art graduates exhibiting in Producing The Goods, a heartening finale to its
150th anniversary year which ranges, as does Glasgow's design school, from
embroidery to engineering, though sadly omitting electronic imaging from the
show.
Dugald Cameron, GSA director, points out the school was originally set up in
1845 as a government school of design. He adds: ``It has been happy to meander
between fine art and design, with applied arts as the bridge, ever since.
That's Glasgow Art School's distinctive quality. Here the decorative arts,
traditional crafts, and industrial and commercial design spill into one
another. That's our strength.''
Sadly, Cameron, a designer himself, was not on the selection panel for the 1999
director. In fact, there was no design expert among the six: Pat Lally, Robert
Gould, Stuart Gulliver, Mike Hayes, Bob Palmer, and architect Andrew Wright,
who must decide between a short-list of five - three Londoners and two Scots,
Neil Baxter and Frank Binnie. The Londoners include two folk closely involved
with the 1999 competition: Victoria Thornton, who was a judge, and Rory Coonan,
who chaired the judging panel. The fifth candidate, Deyan Sudjic, editor of
Blueprint, is odds-on favourite with Thornton.
All the usual suspects in fact. The expensive London headhunters did not
produce anyone most of us could not have come up with in 10 minutes over a
coffee.
Meanwhile, up at Glasgow School of Art, real people with hands-on design
experience are still trying to teach and do their own work and produce exciting
new talent, some of whom can be seen in Assorted, a show of work from MA Design
students at the 1999 Gallery in Princes Square till December 28.
Some featured in Producing the Goods also taught other celebrated
internationalists, for several generations are represented here - from Tom
Scott, head of design at Ford, Detroit, or Chuck Mitchell, ex-textiles
designer, now retired and creating wild and wonderful opulent decorative wall
panels, to Kenny Holmes, a 1988 graduate currently teaching part-time at the
school who worked for Conran before creating the flagship interiors for Lanvin
in Paris.
The variety of work here is impressive, embracing graduates aged 25 to 60, from
product design and ceramics to jewellery and textiles. A smart Loganair plane
wing (graphics courtesy Charles Randak) hangs beside felted wool knits for Paul
Smith, Ralph Lauren, and M.&amp;.S (by Alan Gallagher), along with jewellery by
Eric Smith (who won the De Beers Award for 14 consecutive years plus Designer
of the Year 1993 and Dest Diamond Award 1994 from his Newton Mearns base).
There are TV graphics from Sandy Anderson, BAFTA winner for BBC, and ceramics
by McNamara and Leckie. Joe Hall's work beat the Pirelli calendar into second
place in 1985. He says: ``At GSA I learnt the essential `Remove it if it's not
necessary'.''
Paul Simmons and Alistair McAuley of Timorous Beasties fabrics have work in the
V.&amp;.A and New York's Cooper Hewitt Museums as well as Glasgow's Living Room and
Maxaluna. John McNeece, a world leading maritime interior designer, whose
projects include the QE2 and P.&amp;.O's Oriana, says: ``P.&amp;.O knew what they
wanted: simple, classic, timeless elegance - a bit like the little black
dress.''
There is one problem: how to show a 70,000 ton liner in an exhibition? Pam Hogg
gets round it with a stylish cat-walk video while Tom Scott has a large-scale
silver metallic model of his new Ford luxury sportcar, ``with disco glitter on
its bum'', as Sir Terance Conran put it at the opening.
Conran, another 1999 judge and said to be on the new 1999 executive along with
Cameron, Gulliver, Gould, and others, tells me: ``If the city is to live up to
the expectations the judges and Arts Council have of it, the city fathers and
officials must demonstrate a determination that design is important to the
welfare of the city.
``Good design makes people feel good. It's a very difficult thing to prove, but
I know it to be a fact. Think what Mackintosh has done for Glasgow's reputation.
``Unlike opera and ballet, design touches us daily. One might speculate why the
Government has not recognised the importance of design, which so far gets
nothing from the Lottery, when it can do so much for industry?''
Meanwhile, Conran himself has taken the bull by the horns and set up the Conran
Foundation archive which each year invites someone ``with an educated,
discovering eye and international awareness'' to spend a windfall of #30,000 on
things they would like to own to build a collection ``with attitude'' at
London's Design Museum, ``a valuable reference for future generations''.
This year, Conran has chosen Kirkpatrick, who has already settled on M.&amp;.S
Tactel knickers and a Ducati motorbike (which she will drive back from Italy
with Scottish Speed Champion Alan Duffus in February).
Over the past decade, since she set up Graven Images ``to prove design could
enhance people's lives in Scotland'', Kirkpatrick has been involved in many
projects, like the aborted 1980s Sherrif Court Design Centre and the much
diminished 1996 Design Festival.
Like many, she now despairs of achieving anything in Glasgow which she sees as
``a bureaucratic disaster orchestrated behind closed doors'' and is turning her
attention to America.
From all the comments I've received recently there is something seriously wrong
with Glasgow 1996 and 1999 and the new director will have to move fast to
rectify things - and be prepared to open a can of worms along the way.

THE Derby could be moved to an earlier time slot next year to avoid a clash
with England's opening match of the Euro '96 football championships.
Officials at Epsom are close to agreeing a switch designed to maximise interest
in the Classic, the highlight of the Flat racing season, without directly
conflicting with the football tournament.
A start time around 2.30, half an hour before the scheduled kick-off, is the
most likely outcome of discussions currently being conducted with sponsors
Vodafone, Channel 4, and other media organisations.
If the race remained at this year's off time of 3.50, it would take place
during the half-time interval of England's most important fixture since the
World Cup qualifiers.
However, Edward Gillespie, United Racecourses' managing director, said: ``Our
concern is to make sure we maximise the impact of the race and place it at a
time when we can achieve this.
``We are sure the race is on the right day but it is the precise timing that is
being discussed. I don't think an evening slot is likely. It could be run
during half-time but we have the build-up to the event to consider as well.''
The Derby moved from its traditional Wednesday running to Saturday this year in
a bid to revive interest in what was once Britain's biggest outdoor event.
But the switch now brings the race into direct competition with many other
summer sporting fixtures. This year it clashed with the cricket between England
and the West Indies.
David Hillyard, of UR's owners Racecourse Holdings Trust, believe the rewards
could be significant for the new-look Derby. ``On such a big sporting day we
could be thinking of a potential sporting audience of 20 million for the Derby,
which we could not achieve in the midweek.
``If we promote it right we could potentially harness an audience three, four
or five times as big as we are used to.''

By HUGH McKINLAY Dundee 2, Dunfermline 4
DUNFERMLINE skipper Norrie McCathie could afford a wry smile after this
pulsating top-of-the-table clash at Dens Park. He and fellow defender Andy Tod
seemed to have sold the jerseys after only 10 minutes with slack play which
helped Dundee take a 2-0 lead.
``Diabolical defending,'' was how manager Bert Paton described it.
But two minutes later, McCathie atoned for his part in the shambles when he
belted the ball home from six yards after a David Bingham cutback, and then Tod
followed up a Stewart Petrie equaliser with a spectacular overhead kick six
minutes before half-time.
McCathie said later: ``It was quite a shock to the system to be two goals down,
but we knew we were good enough to get back. The fact that we did it before
half-time made it all the better.''
When asked whether, with top strikers Kenny Ward, Andy Smith, and Greg Shaw all
sitting in the stand because of injury, McCathie-Tod was to become the new
strike partnership, he joked: ``We're fed up telling the strikers that we've
got to go up and score a few goals, and they are giving us stick for losing
them at the back.''
As for Tod's goal, McCathie said: ``He took it well, a great strike, although
even he knows the ball could have gone anywhere. He says now he's going to
become a skinhead to get the Vialli look.''
Tod admitted: ``The keeper punched out Marc Miller's corner kick and the ball
went over my head. It was the only way I could get to it, and it worked.''
It was an eventful day all round for Tod. After George Shaw had put Dundee
ahead after five minutes, Tod's challenge on Andy Cargill sent the midfield man
tumbling in the box, and Jim Hamilton slotted home the penalty.
Petrie's equaliser had plenty of drama about it as well. Dundee keeper Michel
Pageaud - described by manager Jim Duffy as ``good with the passback'' -
inexplicably needed a second touch on a pass from Tommy McQueen as Petrie
closed in. Pageaud's attempted clearance hit the Dunfermline striker, and he
was first to react by heading the ball over the line.
Paul Tosh then ended Dundee's hopes of a fightback when he lunged at Bingham,
and was immediately red-carded. Bingham was carried off with ankle ligament
damage.
Derek Fleming's clinching fourth goal came after a strong run and shot from Tod
which was deflected into the full back's path and he headed home.
Paton said: ``Now we are getting a settled team, that's a big plus. We are
beginning to play as we did at the start of the season when we won seven in a
row with virtually the same team each week.''
Duffy, however, was totally baffled as to why his side played so badly.
``We were not just making basic mistakes out there today, they were comical. I
had half-a-dozen players knocking the ball up in the air or upfield, or
anywhere just for the sake of it. You need discipline in games like this. I'm
not taking anything away from Dunfermline, they played well, but we just seemed
to say: `Here, you're a good team, go and have another hit'.''
Duffy refused to blame the loss of Morten Wieghorst the previous day to Celtic.
He said: ``The players themselves were delighted for Morten. Of course we
missed him, but that was not why we lost.''
Duffy's other puzzle - and at the moment he has no answer to the problem - is
that Dundee have won only one league game in the eight played so far this
season at Dens Park. That's 16 vital points dropped out of 24, and could
already be a telling blow in the promotion race.

TWO years ago Michael Walsh and his colleagues faced an uncertain future. The
company they worked for was no longer considered a core activity by their
parent company and the business was up for sale.
Michael Walsh and three fellow directors Charles Patterson, Douglas Thompson,
and Douglas Marmion at first considered launching a management buy-out, but
this proved to be impractical.
Instead, one year ago, out of the ashes of their previous company they formed
the Acts Partnership with the help of Dunbartonshire Enterprise.
``Technically we were unemployed for a day,'' said Mr Walsh, ``Monday was a
holiday, we took Tuesday off, and started work on the Wednesday.''
A great deal has happened in the first year of Acts Partnership existance.
The building services side of their business has expanded, but in May it
started a separate company Pentran to offer health and safety advice to
clients, and this business has already proved to be a remarkable success.
Since May Pentran has collected 41 contracts to act as Planning Supervisors on
a variety of projects.
``Since April 1, the Government has required that health and safety is an
integral part of any building development, and a planning supervisor's position
has to be appointed for each construction site,'' said Michael Walsh.
The thinking behind this new piece of legislation said Michael Walsh was to
ensure that the health and safety aspect has to be thought right through, from
the construction to the maintenance of a building, and also to the end of its
life when it might have to be demolished.
Acts Partnership has linked up with Paisley University to provide this new
service, and Michael Walsh believes it will continue to expand.
Acts Partnership began with eight of a staff, and now along with Pentran has a
staff of 12.
Next year Pentran is likely to increase its present technical staff from two to
five, and also in January it will employ an occupational therapist.
``We are engaging an occupational therapist because companies must give
construction workers training on manual handling and also carers in nursing
homes need this type of training as back ailments are a major problem for
people who are continually lifting,'' said Michael Walsh.

n A POSITIVE ventilation system for boxed potato stores has been developed by F
J Pirie and Company, of Ayrshire. It is already on trial in a large commercial
potato store in the East of England and is being monitored by the industry's
top technical specialists.
``The key feature of the new system is its ability to provide even air
distribution patterns throughout a boxed store,'' said Frank Pirie, managing
director.
``With potato storage across Europe becoming increasingly based on boxed
systems, we felt a new approach was needed for those who favour the use of
positive ventilation to keep tubers in top quality condition.''
n DESPITE recent concerns over winter forage stocks, and the resulting pressure
to make the most of autumn grass, milk quality is holding up well, according to
results from the rolling annual dairy costings from Dalgety Agriculture up to
the end of September.
Milk protein concentration is better than last year at 3.24%. Fat concentration
is down, reflecting the drive of many milk producers not to encourage milk fat.
n THERE is a serious shortage of farm-raised venison, according to the
marketing co-operative Scottish Farmed Venison. ``We urgently need many new
entrants to farm deer,'' said Russell Marchant, SFV chairman.
``Independent analysis of the market has revealed significant scope for
growth.'' There is a deer farming open day tomorrow at Barony College, near
Dumfries, covering animal health, economics, deer handling, and fencing.
n A DAIRY farmer from Bradnop, near Leek, Staffordshire, has been fined #9700
for selling black market milk to an unapproved purchaser. He admitted six
offences at Leek Magistrates' Court. John Plant, of Stile House Farm, will also
be required to pay superlevy of 30p a litre on sales of milk not covered by his
quota.
n THE deadline for submission of 1995/96 leases of milk quota to the
Intervention Board is Decemnber 15.

WITH no set, no costumes, and simply reading from the script, the Tron Theatre
Company managed to generate incredible tension from their work-in-progress
presentation of Anthony Neilson's The Love We Find Ourselves - the final
showcase in their short but exciting season of New Scottish Writing.
Performance director Michael Boyd, who read stage directions throughout, warned
that Neilson was playing some interesting visual games which here were only
hinted at with the occasional use of a camcorder but even without an element of
elaborate visuals the drama was still compulsive. It's a densely-layered play
which shows a maturity in Neilson's work and displays his insight into
male-female relationships.
Centred on a famed Scottish film director, Kenneth Ogilvie, mysteriously drawn
to a hotel in the Highlands as the setting for what is almost certainly going
to be his swan-song movie, the play deftly explores the art of objectification,
against a thrilling backdrop of the paranormal, perverse, desire, and simmering
violence. Ogilvie, brilliantly played by Tom Watson, is working without a
script, attempting to orchestrate a love affair between his two actors without
success - Earl crystalising his dislike of his co-star Rachel with the
contemptuous ``I can hear her swallow from across the room''.
With malevolent spirits interfering, Ogilvie increasingly loses control of the
situation, his diminishing power mirrored in physical decline, with Neilson
charting every action with devastating precision, building suspense, and
showing a sophistry of craft which marks him out as one of the most talented
and promising playwrights around.

Concern over
racist graffiti
A TOURISM boss has spoken out against an outbreak of anti-English graffiti. Mr
Patrick Laughlin, deputy director of Perthshire Tourist Board, wants a large
``English Go Home'' slogan removed from a prominent former railway bridge.
The appearance of the 3ft-high slogan follows concern over anti-English
leaflets circulated in Perth urging action against ``white settlers''. Mr
Laughlin stressed that #70m of the #221m Perth earned annually from tourism
came from English visitors.
Crowns to stay

IMPROVED toilet facilities in urban areas could help create a greener
countryside, it was suggested at an international fertiliser conference in
Cambridge yesterday.
More farmers may have to get used to the idea of their fields being used as
recycling plants for township wastes.
Swedish research has found that human toilet wastes are second only to
livestock wastes as a source of the vital soil ingredients nitrogen, phosphate,
and potash (NPK).
But the solid wastes also tend to contain harmful residues, such as heavy
metals.
New waste management concepts being developed in Sweden involve separate
collecting tanks for urine and faeces with the application of the former
directed to agricultural land after storage but with no further treatment.
``The question whether the use of human urine is suitable on agricultural land
is one of the key questions in this system both concerning the fertiliser value
as well as hygienic and toxicological aspects,'' said Professor Holger
Kirchmann, of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala.
``The N and P effect of human urine was tested in a pot experiment resulting in
somewhat higher gaseous losses and lower crop uptake of urine N compared with
ammonium sulphate but, in the same crop, the uptake of P was comparable with
soluble P fertiliser. Preliminary bacteriological studies indicate low
concentrations of E coli in stored human urine.''
Due to heavy-metal contamination of sewage sludge, it is considered doubtful if
solid toilet wastes can be used as a source of P, he said. But, if there was a
large-scale conversion to urine-separating toilets in the home, this could
boost P recirculation by 20% and more than double the N recycling with an
improvement in the K figure.
``To achieve an environmental sound agriculture cycling of plant nutrients is a
prerequisite, but also the ability to maintain sustainable agriculture over
decades and centuries will largely depend on our successful management of
biological wastes and the return of plant nutrients to arable land.''
While accepting the broad thrust of the recycling argument at the Fertiliser
Society's annual conference, Dr Joachim Lammel, of Hydro Agri Europe, argued
that handling and other costs would limit the use of urban wastes to areas in
close proximity to towns. Animal wastes also provided a greater amount of
nutrients.
This could change with environmental pressure and legislation as landfill sites
and other disposal methods developed limitations. Recycling of on-farm produced
organic waste would certainly be imposed on agriculture by legislation in the
near future.
He pointed out that the fertiliser industry had been founded on the recycling
of animal wastes such as bones, fish waste, blood, and guano. Environmental
problems and the realisation that raw materials for inorganic nutrients were
not infinite would bring them back to this point.
``Recycling of nutrient-containing waste or by-products represents a challenge
as well as an opportunity for the fertiliser industry,'' he said.

LABOUR'S Scottish Home Affairs spokesman, Mr John McFall, yesterday claimed
that Scotland's prison population could soar by about 3000 to nearly 9000
because of the Government's proposed tougher measures on sentencing and release
dates.
There are about 5800 people in prison in Scotland, of whom 1000 are on remand
awaiting trial.
Mr McFall based his estimate on a similar study carried out in England and
Wales by the Penal Affairs Consortium, which argued that 48 prisons would have
to be built there to cope with the increase.
Concerns about a rising prison population have been fuelled by Home Secretary
Michael Howard indicating that the Government intended to introduce automatic
life sentences on a second conviction for a serious violent or sexual offence,
minimum sentences for repeat burglars and drug dealers, and a drastic reduction
in early-release mechanisms such as parole.
Mr McFall argued yesterday that the prison system was bursting at the seams.
``We can look forward to an increase in the rioting which has been a feature of
recent years,'' he added.
On BBC Radio Scotland yesterday, Mr Edward Frizell, chief executive of the
Scottish Prison Service, said that the notion you could take people at the end
of the criminal justice process who have been engaged in crime for many years,
wave a magic wand at them in prison and send them out as model citizens, was
wrong.

IN ENGLAND
CLEARLY, there is to be no early resolution to the crisis of confidence facing
Premiership champions Blackburn Rovers when they play away from home.
Saturday's 5-0 defeat by bottom club Coventry City was all the more
demoralising coming as it did immediately after two good performances at Ewood
Park where West Ham and Rosenborg had been beaten 4-2 and 4-1 inside four days.
They had survived on those occasions without Scottish international defender
Colin Hendry, but at Highfield Road, Chris Sutton, bought as a #5m striker,
could not cope with the resurgent Dion Dublin and the outcome was a humiliation.
Supporters will soon be asking such questions as:
l What exactly is Kenny Dalglish's role as director of football?
l Why was Ray Harford so much more effective as a coach than a manager?
l What has gone so wrong in the dressing-room that highly-paid players fight on
the pitch and seem to fall apart at the sight of an away crowd?
If Blackburn's was the most startling result, those involving Newcastle and
Manchester United were hardly expected.
Newcastle were overwhelmed for 45 minutes at Chelsea, for whom Dan Petrescu
scored the only goal.
Kevin Keegan admitted: ``We played very poorly by our standards in the first
half. The best thing was that other results didn't exactly go against us.''
By that he meant United's 2-2 draw at home to Sheffield Wednesday - Eric
Cantona scoring both - and Arsenal's failure to win at Southampton where their
captain Tony Adams was sent off in a goalless draw. David Platt was injured
and, like Newcastle's Robert lee, will miss England's friendly at home to
Portugal tomorrow.
Tottenham's Teddy Sheringham also picked up an injury in the 1-0 home win over
QPR, who have adopted a more direct style to suit Mark Hateley, but are now
rooted in the bottom three.
Wimbledon, convinced that they must move to Dublin and Cardiff to survive,
earned a valuable point at Leeds, but Manchester City's improved run ended at
Middlesbrough, where Juninho scored his first goal for the club.
Bolton hit the bottom with an unfortunate 1-0 home defeat by Liverpool.

THIS brief, mystical encounter under the Cathedral's sheltering bulk came as a
timely antidote to the seasonal hugger-mugger of the day. For that alone, much
thanks to the whole Clamjamfrie team.
We gathered in darkness to the sound of waves lapping, as if the Cathedral
precinct had somehow become a sanctuary of ambient calm. The area was embraced
by scaffolding towers - each with a hanging screen - while at the Cathedral end
there was a bank of steps topped by a huge screen that filled with shifting
images of Glasgow's people past and present. Midway up the steps, a tree .....
branches dangling with inverted wine glasses. ``This is the cup that never
cheered'' maybe? As part of a new Glasgow flourish?
And into this arena came angels with wings like snowflakes and dossers
overcoats. Drawn by the energy of the place, they had come to be part of it.
They tapped into the history of the place - aided by some fine evocative
singing from Cumbernauld Gaelic Choir - and they recognised the divisiveness of
poverty.
And if there were moments when the complex, ambitious mix of video, sound,
performance and text didn't quite gell, there were moments - Emma Davie, for
instance, telling the names of her long-departed forebears who had come to the
city and made it their home - when the sheer poetic sense of people and place,
of humanity and its on-going resilience, really did make the heart squeeze with
a jumble of emotions.
Satellite said much about how Glasgow sees itself - would like to be seen - and
it said it with feeling, honesty and affection. Well worth braving the December
chills to be part of.

DARREN Maclean had every reason to leave the field with head bowed on Saturday.
The midfield man had played his last game for Forres Mechanics - and only 24
minutes of it.
Maclean, who returned to Highland football two-and-half years ago via Dundee,
is taking a year out from the game after promotion at work. But his departure
has been hastened by three sendings off in as many games.
He had hoped to make his big farewell before the home fans next Saturday
against Clach.
Forres manager George Cowie, said: ``He had stud marks up his chest, and had
basically had enough.
``His recent disciplinary record has been terrible but, to be fair, he has been
a great servant to the club.''
Elsewhere, Elgin City ended Wick Academy's 11-match unbeaten run with a 4-0 win
at Borough Briggs. Alan Dunsire grabbed a hat trick, and Ross McHardy got the
other, as they moved into fourth place.
Huntly eased seven points clear with a 3-1 win over Fraserburgh. Brora grabbed
a surprise 1-0 win over Keith.

BRITAIN's farm machinery dealers' association, BAGMA, is aiming to provide a
road show offering technical expertise for customers at leading events year.
This follows unprecedented demand for information on a wide range of subjects
at the recent Smithfield FarmTech event in London.
``The number and range of questions we got from farmers on our machinery advice
centre at Smithfield was staggering,'' said Ian Jones, BAGMA's general manager.
``They wanted more information on everything from satellite positioning and
electronic tractor controls to advice on tyres, oils, engines, and welding.
``It showed there is a tremendous unsatisfied demand for this type of
information, and we are now looking at ways of satisfying this by staging a
series of advice-centre appearances at key shows, such as the Highland, the
Royal Welsh, the Great Yorkshire, and possibly the Royal next year.''
It is seen as part of the new service offered by the association to its 600
members, including the 80 new groups that have joined in the past year as a
result of its recruitment drive following a merger with the British Hardware
Federation.
A BAGMA spokesman commented: ``A road show operation would be good for the
dealer trade as it would enable it to display its expertise and it would be
good for the farmers who clearly want to know a lot more about the developing
technologies in the business.''

Dumbarton 0, St Mirren 0
DUMBARTON kept their distance from St Mirren in the table and their goal intact
while doing nothing much. Achieving less on the park, Saints did ditto.
In buoyant mood, Jim Fallon, the Dumbarton manager, saw the score as a sweet
nothing. He said: ``St Mirren had four or five chances. Before today, all of
them would have been converted into goals. It has been raining goals here.''
For much of the first half, Dumbarton showered very few threats. However, in
one bright spell Dumbarton three times nearly gave St Mirren a soaking.
First, Steve Dallas forced a corner after a good run by Roland Fabiani,
prompted by some Martin Mooney trickery. In rapid order, Campbell Money
repelled, one-handed, a header by Martin Melvin before Colin McKinnon headed
just over.
With another stop at the feet of Fabiani, Money kept St Mirren in the game in
the first half as Ken Meachan, formerly of Greenock Juniors, saved Dumbarton in
the second.
A point-blank save by Meachan from Barry Lavety sent a warm glow from the
goalkeeper's hands all the way to the chilled toes of the crowd.
It was a niggling - five players booked and four given a telling off by the
referee - and an eerie encounter. Partly, that was the Boghead lights. While
they illuminated some patches they left other parts darker than night.
Dumbarton's Chic Charnley spent the second half punting high balls into the
empty gloom. It contrasted with his first half of enjoying the freedom of the
midfield. Possibly, all the jogging he did to take corners from either flank
and free kicks from all over the place had wearied him.
By the tenth minute of the second half, St Mirren had used all three outfield
substitutes. Although their patchwork performance was made less pallid and
threadbare, patchy it remained.
Their good news is that Jamie Fullerton returned from injury to play from the
interval, while Norrie McWhirter could be back on Saturday.
About Saturday, manager Jimmy Bone said: ``I think some of them turned up today
expecting to win without working.''

<HEADLINE>Study leave for prelim exams to be recorded as authorised absence in latest rule change</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974946540</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish Office has bowed to pressure from secondary schools over the way
in which the absence of pupils on study leave for preliminary examinations is
recorded, writes BARCLAY McBAIN.
With the drive to publish tables of attendance and absence, secondaries were
required from January this year to classify prelim study leave as unauthorised
absence, putting it into the same category as truancy.
Study leave during the full, external Standard Grade, Higher, and Sixth Year
studies diet of exams was defined, however, as authorised absence.
The Scottish Office requirement is likely to have an impact on the latest
attendance and absence figures, expected to be published shortly.
However, the Government has again changed the rules because of representations
from some schools, which argued that the pressure to ensure pupil attendance
during the winter prelim diets - and thereby reduce their unauthorised absence
figures - would cause timetabling and accommodation problems.
It has now told local authorities and headteachers that study leave for
internal prelim exams is also to be recorded as authorised absence. The new
classification is to be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the current
school session in August.
The change of mind has taken education authority officers by surprise. Mr Bill
Coyle, regional inspector for Strathclyde, said it would not help schools which
wanted to ensure that their pupils spent as much time as possible in the
classroom.
He said: ``I believe in maximising learning time. I do not think there should
be any study leave for internal exams. Schools should make arrangements within
their timetables to ensure that their pupils are there during the prelims.''
Heads will be under severe pressure to find sufficient teaching time under the
forthcoming Higher Still reform of upper secondary schooling and its longer
courses.
Mr Coyle said the Scottish Office decision appeared curious, given that Higher
Still demanded change in the opposite direction, with the need to identify as
much time as possible in the school year for teaching subjects.
A growing number of heads are concerned about how pupils spend their study
leave away from school when they should be preparing for exams.
Allowing pupils an average of four weeks off for studying - two for prelims and
two for external exams - accounts for about 10% of the school year and there
are concerns that the trend does not maximise learning time, recognised as a
key pointer to effective education.

<HEADLINE> Sulphur deficiency becomes growing problem</HEADLINE>

A DECADE ago sulphur deficiency was rarely heard of, being isolated to a few
pockets of land. Things have changed drastically in the last few years as more
cases are being reported.
Why this sudden change? Traditionally in Southern Scotland most of the sulphur
inputs to the soil came from the atmosphere in the form of pollutants from
industry - anywhere down-wind from heavy industry was sure to have all its
sulphur requirements met from this source.
But industry has cleaned up its act and this source of sulphur has declined.
There has also been a change away from using fertilisers that contain some
sulphur as an additional nutrient. For example, ammonium sulphate used to be a
popular nitrogen fertiliser but it has been largely replaced with more
nitrogen-rich sources like ammonium nitrate.
The result has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of sulphur deficiency
and it is becoming more widespread.
Two years ago, plant analysis picked up a case in a cereal crop near Paisley,
an area we never would have expected such a problem. This year we have
diagnosed quite a few incidences in and around Dumfries, and we suspect that a
lot of cases are going unnoticed.
Crop susceptibility varies but crops like oilseed rape, two/three cut silage,
and brassicas have a particular high sulphur demand. As the problem becomes
more severe, cereals also become vulnerable and increasingly the crops require
routine sulphur dressings to ensure yields.
Soil type also has a strong influence on whether sulphur deficiency is likely
to be a problem. Sandy, low organic matter soils contain little sulphur soil
reserves. Sulphur is also readily lost by leaching so it is difficult to build
up soil levels and yearly additions are required.
Sulphur deficiency can be diagnosed by soil and plant analysis but plant
analysis is the more reliable method. Measurement of tissue sulphur on its own
gives little information and it should be used in conjunction with the nitrogen
content, with nitrogen to sulphur rations greater than 17 to one usually
indicative of a problem.
With the increased incidence of sulphur deficiency, there has been a whole
range of products put on the market and this is likely to grow in the coming
years.
Basically they fall into two groups - pure sulphur or sulphate containing
products. Both types offer advantages and disadvantages. Plants can only take
up worthwhile amounts of sulphur through the roots and it must be in the form
of sulphate for the roots to absorb it.
Applications of pure sulphur relies on a combination of both chemical and
biological processes converting the sulphur to sulphate before the crop can
utilise it. This can be a problem in springs where this conversion is slow and
the crop does not get the sulphate at the rate it needs to satisfy its demands.
However, pure sulphur does not leach so it is not lost following a period of
heavy rain. Sulphate-containing products supply sulphur in a form a plant can
use immediately so there is no delay period, but it can be lost by leaching.

Laboratory in Edinburgh.

<GRAPHIC>Photograph CORRECTION: The caption should read that Golden Casket now produces six million sweets each week</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>974946542</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LIFE has been sweet for Douglas Rae since he gave up a promising career in
banking and started his own confectionery company.
The Golden Casket company which he launched in 1959 with #100 is now
successfully marketing Buchanan Toffees and other brands throughout the United
Kingdom and abroad.
More than six million sweets are manufactured at the company's factory in
Greenock, and a #500,000 investment programme is currently under way to provide
both additional production and distribution facilities.
The company first went into confectionery production in 1972 when Douglas Rae
bought chocolate makers Fullers from THF, and the Buchanan's of Scotland range
was added in 1978.
However, in 1987 the company made the strategic decision to sell Fullers.
``We found that we were working non stop supplying the multiple stores and were
competing with the big boys. We were selling the Fullers, brands into the
multiples while Buchanans was geared more for the independents which was the
side of the business I preferred,'' said Douglas Rae.
The sale of the Fullers business saw employment at Greenock drop from a peak of
130 to 25, but Douglas Rae immediately began to rebuild the company.
In 1990 Golden Casket bought Drysdale &amp; Gibb, whose boiled sweets including
soor plooms are considered in the industry to be the Rolls Royce of boiled
sweets, and employment has now climbed to 100.
The three companies Golden Casket, Buchanan's of Scotland, and Drysdale &amp; Gibb
operate independently and Douglas Rae explained how they expanded right through
the recession.
``Other companies were paying sales representatives off, but I did the
opposite. We added to our sales force and the result was that our turnover
increased every year.''
Three years ago Golden Casket re-entered the export market and now sells its
confectionery in Holland, Germany, Malta, Spain, Belgium and Italy.
``Scottish fudge is very popular on the continent, and we have recently
launched Buchanan's Best in Europe,'' said Douglas Rae.
Although the company has is business eyes on Europe, Douglas Rae does not
forget his customers closer at home.
Buchanan Toffees sponsors Greenock Morton, and Douglas Rae, who has rarely
missed a game at Cappielow in the last fifty years, is delighted to be able to
support his favourite team.

<HEADLINE>CBI calls for #2bn extra on transport</HEADLINE>

THE UK needs to invest around #2000m a year more on its transport
infrastructure to have a system comparable to those of our European
competitors, according to a CBI report.
The report, Moving Forward - a business strategy for transport, also calls for
a move away from cash for roads to other transport, such as rail.
Britain invested 60% less per person than Germany and 25% less than France
during the years 1985 to 1993. However, the CBI stresses that vital though
greater investment is, it is not in itself enough to tackle congestion.
It says there must be a broad strategic framework. Without this, traffic growth
resulting from economic growth would simply threaten to increase congestion and
damage competiveness and the environment.
Although increased investment in roads is seen as vital, the CBI believes the
balance of investment must change in favour of other types of transport such as
rail, buses, and shipping to help encourage a switch away from cars and lorries.
Private financing will have an important role to play but is not yet enough to
reverse recent cuts in public spending, says the CBI.
Transport Secretary Sir George Young broadly welcomed the report while pointing
out that the call for an additional #2000m a year appeared to conflict with the
CBI's warm reaction to the recent Budget as being ``a responsible one with its
emphasis on reducing public borrowing''.

CHICKABIDDY, who turned in a rare poor effort when last of seven behind Secret
Four at Taunton, can bounce back to form with a win in the Levy Board Hurdle at
Newton Abbot today, writes White and Gold.
That effort was disappointing in view of the fact that Gordon Edwards' mare had
made the frame in each of her seven previous starts this season.
Among that number are two victories, one over course and distance with the
other coming at Exeter.
It is difficult to come up with an explanation as to what went wrong at
Taunton, but given her previous good record, Chickabiddy can be forgiven one
poor performance and the Henbit mare can recoup losses here.
Ron Hodges's Northern Saddler can complete a hat trick by defying top-weight in
the Best In The West Challenge Chase. The eight-year-old, a winner here on his
reappearance, was lucky at Worcester last time, but this does not look a strong
race.

LIFE has not been easy for Emma and Amy Hughes, the world's earliest surviving
premature twins.
They were 110 days early at Glasgow's Royal Maternity Hospital in September
1993. Amy weighed 1lb 7oz, Emma 1lb 14oz.
Both required micro heart surgery and both developed the rare disease,
hyper-calcarine, an allergy to calcium ruling out chocolates, dairy products,
and even cornflakes.
Just after Christmas last year, Emma was diagnosed as suffering from cerebral
palsy.
Last week, she had to go back into the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at
Yorkhill because the tube leading from her mouth to her stomach was too large
and almost every feed was being regurgitated.
She was getting little benefit from food and her growth and strength was being
seriously affected.
She was weak, unwell, and showed little signs of improving.
Consultant paediatric surgeon Robert Karachi performed a fundoplication,
literally wrapping her stomach around the tube to create a sphincter and narrow
it.
He also carried out a gastronomy, inserting a capped tube direct into her
stomach. The plastic manhole cover means the normal eating process is by-passed
and Emma can even be fed while she sleeps. Meantime, the newly shaped narrow
tube will gradually come into use. She was released at the weekend.
Their parents, Brian and Jane Hughes from Cumbernauld, hope that Emma will be
accepted for treatment at the Craig Albert Centre, three miles from their home.
It specialises in the treatment of children suffering from cerebral palsy.
Mrs Hughes, 28, said yesterday: ``The last two years have been as frustrating
for us as they have been for Emma.
``She has grown up watching her sister do things that she is just incapable of
doing.
``How can you explain to her that she is just not capable of walking and
talking like her sister and that she is not so co-ordinated?
``The look of determination on her face is sometimes almost frightening.
``Hopefully, if she is accepted for the Craig Albert Centre, things will start
to improve and she can look forward to a healthy and happy life.''

THE last time St Johnstone and Dundee United paired up in a Tayside Derby,
Perth manager Paul Sturrock collapsed under the strain.
This latest encounter with his former club never looked likely to impose the
same degree of stress levels on the Saints' manager, with his rejuvenated team
enjoying the edge over a carbon copy of the Tannadice XI which had knocked
eight goals past Dumbarton the previous week.
Perhaps Billy Kirkwood's players used up their quota of goals in dispensing
with the Sons because former United goalkeeper Alan Main was called upon just
once to bail out his defence, diving to block a Grant Johnson shot before the
break.
While United faltered in their championship quest, home fans were warmed on an
ice-cold day by the promise of new #250,000 recruits Attila Sekerlioglu - the
first Austrian to grace the Scottish soccer stage - and Coventry winger Leigh
Jenkinson.
Sturrock observed: ``We've had problems with the midfield blend ever since I
arrived here. I want Attila to provide leadership in that area and he showed up
well in the second half. He's a touch special and he's going to prove a real
character.''
The Saints manager waxed lyrical about a command performance from captain Jim
Weir, labelling the ex-Hearts man's display ``the best since his arrival from
Tynecastle''.
Certainly United striker Craig Brewster, who notched up four goals in his
previous outing, was restricted to meagre rations. It was a point not lost on
his manager.
Billy Kirkwood admitted: ``We didn't ask enough questions of Alan Main in the
Saints goal. Our youngsters have been doing well recently but their form took a
wee dip.''
Sekerlioglu, signed from FC Tirol, has three championship medals from his days
with Austria Vienna. He admitted the pace of the game left him short of breath.
The Austrian toasted his introduction to Scotland with a bottle of the Famous
Grouse from the Perth club's sponsors, but confessed: ``During the first half,
I felt as if I was in the middle of a carousel. Back home we have much more
time to play passes. I had chances to score and it would have been nice to get
a goal on my debut.''

Regional League East
Watsonians 28, Preston Lodge 10
ONE of the major problems that ambitious clubs face these days is satisfying
the demands of necessarily enlarged first-team squads.
Watsonians, for example, listed a squad of over-40 players at the beginning of
the premier league championship; not surprisingly all have not made first-team
appearances.
Not, that is, until the start of the Tennents Regional Leagues, a competition
which, viewed at its most cynical, is just a means of filling in fixture space
while the top players are away on representative duty. On a much more positive
perspective it presents clubs with the opportunity of measuring their strengths
against sides from different premier divisions.
Preston Lodge, who announced ambitious plans at the beginning of the season and
a sponsorship package to match, finished fourth in the third division of the
Tennents Premier League this season - their promotion hopes dashed by a poor
start to a campaign that picked up only in the later part of the championship.
For the still ambitious East Lothian club, a match against Watsonians was
clearly an important occasion for them. In the event, however, they failed to
take the opportunity for self-promotion, losing to what was virtually a reserve
Watsonians side at Myreside in one of the few matches to survive the frosty
conditions.
Perhaps the most disappointing feature of Preston Lodge's play was their lack
of enterprise, the visitors clinging to a policy of forward charges and the
high kick from stand-off Murray Stewart.
If this is an indication of the way rugby will be played in the regional
leagues, which should after all not suffer from the pressures of the
premiership, then the exercise can already be written off as a failure.
Fortunately Watsonians were not imbued with the same negative philosophy and
after a shaky start produced some quality back play that brought two tries for
their powerful right wing Graeme Inglis. The second of these owed everything to
the astute running of Jamie Mayer, last year's Scottish Schools centre, playing
outside his former Merchiston colleague Graham Hay whose four conversion goals
boosted the Myreside team's points total.
Watsonians' other tries came from scrum half Jason Hutton following up and
gathering his own kick ahead and flanker Martin Macari from a lineout on the
Preston Lodge try line. Preston Lodge with the first strike of the match - a
close range try by scrum half Scott Gilliland - scored again in the second half
with a touchdown by centre Jake Webber from a charged down clearance kick. But
thereafter the East Lothian team, looking much the less fit of the two sides,
struggled to compete with a Watsonians team eager to make a statement about
reserve strength.

OFPANTS, official panto watchdog, declaring ``impartiality and objectivity will
be hard to achieve on this one'', felt a need to declare a very special
interest: Una McLean. Ever since a certain Jack and the Beanstalk of fond
memory, when McLean, in spangly armour, had struck us as being ``a kind of Jean
d'Arc of Coocaddens'' the watchdog had kept an eye open for more of the
thigh-slapping same.
This Cinderella, however, leaves McLean free to flounce, flirt, frown and
generally flaunt the best frocks, and hats, as the wee-bit-wicked Stepmum. She
has a rare time, too. Is she by any chance planning to lead in Mame soon?
Ofpants is, nonetheless, a stickler for duty. Lots of ticks for Andy Gray and
Paul Young as the Uglies. And a special star for working so well together as a
team. Gray, who can fold his face up like some origami comedy mask, resists the
urge to mug everyone else off the stage and in doing so ensures Young gets full
mileage out of his fishy puns.
Ross King is, of course, in this line-up because of his popular television
connections. TV could well be seen as one of those panto props that eventually
undermines the tradition, but as Buttons he really does make the most of the
live audience, particularly the wee girl who volunteered to marry him when
Cinders (Maria Miller, utterly winsome and sincere) gives him the knockback.
Her decision is made harder to understand every time Amanda Beveridge's Prince
opens the royal mouth - such high-falutin' dialogue, such cut-gless vowels.

THE Paragon Ensemble are rarely short of a novel idea, but they stretched even
their standards of ingenuity with the Scottish premiere of Erwin Stein's
arrangement of Mahler's Symphony No 4, accompanied by Graham Gardner's lighting
effects and Annette Gillies's striking drapings, both of which helped to
transform the rather drab stage area to good effect.
The work itself is more than just a curiousity, but not quite a real success.
Stein's arrangement preserves the crucial dynamic and expressive markings of
the original in a skilful condensation, even if the effect was occasionally
quirky to the point of comic, notably in the first movement.
Re-scoring a symphony of this magnitude for 12 instruments (plus soprano Ann
Archibald) inevitably entails creating an almost separate work, rather than
simply setting the original in a different relief, and some of the resulting
passages were very beautiful, notably in the two central movements. Ultimately,
however, too much of the essential Mahler was sacrificed to make it a fully
convincing alternative.
The first half of the concert featured two contemporary Scottish works in which
French horn was the prominent voice. In the case of Edward McGuire's Prelude
17, it was the only voice, and his typically concentrated musical language
required Hugh Potts to undertake a demanding exploration of the sonic
possibilities of the instrument.
Gordon McPherson's The Bliss of Sexual Ignorance partnered the horn with piano
and celeste, which were placed rather awkwardly alongside each other, to the
detriment of the spacial relationships in this elegant, slow-moving evocation
of the unsaid.

I FIND  it difficult to understand the statement in your editorial (December 1)
that the importance of the Union for all Scots is the one constant in the
constitutional debate.
I would suggest that for all of us, nationalists and unionists alike, the most
important principle in this debate is the democratic right of the Scottish
people to decide how they are governed.
This was implicit in the Claim of Right signed signed by the members of the
Constitutional Convention. Or so it seemed at the time, although the apparent
reluctance to consult the peolple formally through a referendum on the
proposals makes me wonder if they really meant it.
Ewen McMaster, 1 Partickhill Road, Glasgow
IT IS not easy to share the regret expressed in your editorial about the
Liberal Democrats having failed to make political gains from their involvement
with the Constitutional Convention (December 7).
Perhaps the electorate feels that a party that has one MP for every 1% of the
vote has been generously enough treated already, or perhaps it is simply irked
by David Steele's asinine jibes about Alex Salmond during his convention
speech.
While the convention has clearly been a source of many creative and progressive
ideas, its determined refusal to offer an option of independence to the
Scottish people and its expressed raison d'etre of saving the Union must in the
end lead to its downfall after Labour has made use of it to the full.
Indeed, one of the paradoxes of the curent political situation in Scotland has
been Labour's ability to use the convention and the Scottish question in
general to divert attention away from its increasingly right-wing agenda.
We have only to look, for example, at Tony Blair's most recent initiative, the
enthusiastic adoptioin of the far-right Tory teacher-bashing which has so
demoralised and demotivated teachers over the last decade and more, and its
incorporation into Labour's policy proposals.
The present surge in Labour support indicated in your poll is assuredly a
passing phenomenon and will disappear as the Scottish electorate perceives
increasingly the extent to which Tory trousers have been stolen.
Meantime it must be hoped that the SNP leadership will hold firm to the present
policies and not be panicked into the kind of fundamentalist true-believerism
that left the Constitutional Convention to the mercy of Labour in the first
place.
