FATAL accidents at Scottish workplaces have more than halved, according to
figures released yesterday.
For the first time on record, there were no deaths reported in the
manufacturing sector.
The annual report from the Health and Safety Commission and Executive disclosed
16 fatalities in 1994-95, down from 36 the previous year. These occurred in
agriculture, construction, and the service sector.
However, the number of all reported accidents to employees rose during the year
to 12,814.
The report also showed a rise in the number of employers' convictions. There
were 126 convictions resulting in total fines of #496,625 during 1994-95. This
included a fine of #200,000 against BP Chemicals.
Average level of fines in Scotland (#1586) remained substantially lower than
for Britain as a whole (#2364).

THE mother of a newborn baby girl abandoned at the door of Glasgow Royal
Maternity Hospital early yesterday may be in need of urgent medical attention.
Baby Amy, as she is being called by nurses, may have been born as recently as
an hour before she was abandoned.
Hospital staff were alerted at 4am when a female called the switchboard and in
a calm voice told staff where the child could be found.
Dr Layla Al Roomi, a consultant paediatrician at the hospital, said Amy, at 6lb
6ozs, was healthy.
``There is no evidence of any abnormality, congenital or otherwise,'' Dr Al
Roomi said.
Detective Chief Inspector Nanette Pollock, of Strathclyde Police, urged the
mother to come forward as it was feared she may need medical help.
That plea was echoed by Dr Burnett Lunan, the hospital's clinical director:
``The mother has been responsible enough to ensure that the baby is being
looked after and she hasn't given up her rights to the child and society takes
a very tolerant view of these things.''

High-tax
days over,
says Blair
TAX continued to dominate the pre-Budget political agenda yesterday, with Mr
Tony Blair declaring the days of high tax-and-spend Labour ``are over'' and
pledging to ease the tax burden on ``ordinary working families''.
In a speech to newspaper editors last night, Mr Blair said Labour had redefined
the tax debate by wrong-footing the Tories with a pledge to cut VAT and the
lower rate of tax.
Tory Ministers, led by the Prime Minister, ridiculed Labour's new-found
enthusiasm for lower taxes as a gimmick that masked pressures for increasing
Government spending among Labour back benchers.
The Government found support in a forecast by accountants Ernst and Young that
predicted Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown's proposal to reduce the lowest rate
of income tax to 10p would not help those on low incomes.
In the Commons, Mr Blair and Mr Major confronted each other over their
respective tax policies, with Mr Major forced to defend the tax increases
introduced since 1992 as necessary to protect the low-paid.
Labour claimed it would take a 7p cut in the standard rate of income tax to
offset the effects of 21 Tory tax increases, as backbench Tories continued
their pressure on Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to reduce taxes in next Tuesday's
Budget.
In his speech, Mr Blair said: ``We have allowed the Tories too much credit on
tax and the economy. We have characterised them as cruel but competent. In
fact, they are cruel and they are incompetent too.
``This week another important taboo was broken, on tax. Even on tax, we now
have the Tories on the defensive. The days when they could present the debate
between Labour as the party of high taxation and the Tories as the party of low
taxation are gone.''
Mr Blair said thousands of families were now facing an additional tax bill of
around #800 a year. ``Given that punishment on ordinary working families, the
last thing I want to do is add to their tax burden,'' he said. ``We have made
our priorities clear. If there is room for tax cuts, then those cuts should be
fair.''
In the Commons Mr Major told Mr Blair the British electorate would not be
fooled by Labour's new tax measures.
``You may try very hard but you will never convince the people of this country
that your party won't spend more and tax more than the Tory Party.
``It's not credible for Opposition MPs to ask for more spending day after day
and then for them to pretend that they would even hold taxes steady, let alone
reduce them,'' he said.
``They are the high-tax party, they have always been the high-tax party and
they would be the high spending and high tax party in future if they ever had
the chance.''
The tax increases imposed in the two 1993 Budgets were designed to protect the
vulnerable, he said. They had stabilised the public finances, allowing a
reduction in interest rates that had eased the burden on families.
The Ernst and Young research published yesterday claimed Labour's 10p rate
proposal, announced on Monday, would produce higher corporate tax for
businesses.
Mr Douglas Fairbairn, national tax partner for the company, said: ``Reducing
the lower band from 20p to 10p would cost around #6bn. Labour would like this
to come from higher growth but it would almost certainly mean companies bearing
the cost in higher corporate taxation. This would cripple any increase in
employment that lower taxes were meant to create.''

THE Balkan presidents finally put pen to paper on a Bosnian peace pact last
night.
The historic ceremony at the US Air Force base at Dayton, Ohio, scene of the
US-sponsored talks, followed all-night negotations just as the talks seemed on
the verge of collapse. It was initialed by Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia, Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, and Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia.
The last disputed details were settled when President Bill Clinton and his team
persuaded Mr Tudjman and Mr Milosevic to accept their proposals. Mr Izetbegovic
was then compelled to agree.
It appears others were equally cautious. Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, a member of the
Serb delegation, said the proposed territorial division of Bosnia was
unacceptable for separatist Serbs.
The last dispute concerned the Posavina corridor in northern Bosnia that
connects Serb-held territory in western Bosnia with eastern Bosnia and with
Serbia proper. The Serbs wanted the corridor enlarged, the Bosnians and Croats
wanted it closed.
Mr Clinton intervened to persuade Mr Tudjman to accept the loss of some lands
along the corridor. Mr Izetbegovic yesterday at last and reluctantly accepted
that the territories held by the Bosnian-Croat federation he heads would not
obtain clear access to the Sava.
In exchange, he obtained Serb acceptance that Sarajevo remain a united city,
though Serbs in the suburbs will have some special status.
Europe's bloodiest conflict since the Second World War claimed the lives of
250,000 people and made more than two million homeless.
No-one accused of war crimes, such as Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and
his military chief General Ratko Mladic will be able to hold political office.
They will presumably retire to safety in Serbia.
Nato forces, many of them British, are expected to leave for Bosnia next month
as the vanguard of a 60,000-strong mission to implement the peace accord.
Mr Clinton stepped out of the White House to announce the peace deal to the
world after three weeks of tough talking.
``The people of Bosnia finally have a chance to turn from the horror of war to
the promise of peace,'' he said.
Mr Major declared that the people of Bosnia could look forward to a peaceful
future. He said: ``It has taken courage on everyone's part to overcome the many
difficult issues at stake.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said the settlement had come as a
``tremendous relief'' but warned the peace would hold only if Nato committed
ground troops to enforce it, and feared a ``time-bomb'' was still ticking in
Europe's backyard..
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook stressed: ``It is essential that the
international community does not now heave a sigh of relief and turn its back
on Bosnia.''

<TEXT>
FORMER Education Secretary John Patten last night attacked the Government's
divorce law reforms which he warned would ``prime a terrible social and moral
timebomb'' and make Britain ``the divorce capital of the world''.
He told Ministers, during the Queen's Speech debate, that he could not support
the reforms which introduce the concept of no-fault divorce.
Mr Patten, a Roman Catholic, said facts showed children from unbroken families
did better in school and committed less crime.
Mr Patten warned that the divorce reforms could be dangerous for Tories in the
run-up to the next election by alienating supporters.
THE Government last night moved to launch a new wave of oil and gas exploration
off Britain by offering firms the opportunity to enter areas hardly touched so
far. Junior Energy Minister Richard Page, announcing 275 blocks in 68 tranches
under the seventeenth offshore licensing round, said in a written reply that
most are to the west of Scotland, but there are some in the South West
Approaches, the northern North Sea and off England's east coast. Mr Page said:
``We are entering real frontier territory with some of the tranches nearly as
far west as Rockall.''
ARMED Forces Minister Nicholas Soames last night was at the centre of Labour
claims that he has admitted the Government is failing young people and has no
policies to deliver work or opportunities to them. Labour Employment spokesman
Ian McCartney has written to Education and Employment Secretary Gillian
Shephard, asking her to confirm Mr Soames' comments on BBC2's Newsnight
programme on Monday night, when he spoke of the work undertaken with the young
unemployed by the Prince of Wales and added that it: ``Keeps many more people
in work than the Government scheme does.''

<HEADLINE>Victim left with `mangled face' after beating from members of the KOSB Two soldiers jailed for brutal attack</HEADLINE>

TWO serving soldiers who beat a man so savagely that his face had to be
rebuilt, were each jailed for three years yesterday.
The prison sentences will bring an end to the army careers of Gary Logan and
Darren Inglis, both 21, currently serving with the King's Own Scottish
Borderers.
Logan, of Glencoe Road and Inglis of Glenburn Terrace, both Carluke, admitted
assaulting Mr Stephen Murdoch to his severe injury by repeatedly punching and
kicking him on the head and body on November 19 last year.
The attack took place in Cassell Street, Carluke.
Mr Scott Brady, advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh that the
victim re- membered walking along the street and Inglis running past,
threatening him that he was going to give him an awful kicking.
The next thing he remembered was waking up in hospital but an eyewitness
described how the two accused had kicked their victim on the head and stomach
before running away.
Mr Murdoch was taken to Law Hospital with what the casualty surgeon described
as a ``badly mangled face''. He had fractures to the skull, cheekbones, nose,
and jaw and the surgeon described it as one of the most severe beatings he had
ever seen.
Mr Murdoch was transferred to Monklands General and went through a three-hour
operation to reconstruct his face.
Mr Donald Findlay QC, counsel for Logan, said his client had served with the
KOSB and had prospects of a promising career.
However, he would be discharged immediately if he were jailed. He explained
that the victim was a distant cousin of Logan and there had been ill-feeling
for some time between the two accused and Mr Murdoch.
Earlier in the evening, Mr Murdoch had assaulted Inglis and the two soldiers
saw him later brandishing a bottle and threatening them. They took the bottle
off him but plainly went too far.
Mr Findlay submitted that Mr Murdoch had been the principal agitator. He asked
the court to consider deferring sentence for a year and ordering Logan to pay
compensation to his victim.
Mr Desmond Browne, counsel for Inglis, said his client had served a number of
tours in Northern Ireland and was ``a hard-working soldier who has served his
country well.''
Lord Johnston said he had to view the case against the background of a recent
decision in the Court of Criminal Appeal in which a jail sentence in a very
similar case had been nearly doubled.
He felt that a jail sentence was necessary in the public interest to
demonstrate that violence of this kind would not be tolerated.
However, there were strong mitigating factors. Both accused were first
offenders, they had been provoked and, tragically, would lose their Army
careers.
In the circumstances, he felt able to restrict the sentences to three years.

<TEXT>
CAMELOT is making a profit of #1m a week from running the national lottery, its
half-year figures show.
The company, which won the right to run the competition in May 1994, defended
its record of ``efficiency and success'' as it announced it had made #23.6m
after tax in the 24 weeks to September 16.
The performance means its five shareholders - printers De La Rue, Cadbury
Schweppes, Racal Electronics, ICL, and American lottery operator G-Tech - will
share a dividend totalling #9.5m.
The news drew sharp criticism from the Labour Party, which accused Camelot of
enjoying a ``licence to print money''. Dr Jack Cunningham, Shadow Heritage
Secretary, reaffirmed Labour's pledge to seek a non-profit making promoter when
Camelot's seven-year contract expires.
He said: ``This is excessive by any standards and well above what was predicted
or intended at the time of legislation.''
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine last night vigorously defended the use
of lottery money for costly cultural projects.
He said he made no apology for the fact that a good proportion of the cash had
gone to London and he predicted the dawning of a ``golden age'' for the arts,
sports, and heritage.
Grants such as the #55m awarded to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden and
the #50m to the Tate Gallery have drawn accusations of ``elitism'' and London
bias.
However, in a speech at the Tate, Mr Heseltine said it was ``right and
desirable'' that such projects should be based in the capital and be the focus
for lottery funds.
``These projects represent the pinnacle of British excellence. They act as a
focus for our outstanding achievements,'' he said. ``They raise the aspirations
of the nation and the ambitions of younger generations. They help to cater for
markets that are measured in millions and straddle the globe.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday was sent a list of 52 different
controls which, it was claimed, could be removed or relaxed to make local
government more effective.
They range from major changes, such as the abolition of budget capping and the
removal of Government controls over school closures, to the ending of a
400-year-old act dealing with the maintenance of churchyard walls.
The list from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities also included
proposals that councils be allowed to bid for housing stock being transferred
from other landlords and that the responsibility for trunk roads should be
passed to them.
Labour-led Cosla was responding to an earlier call from the Scottish Secretary
to tell him of ways more power could be devolved to councils and controls
relaxed.
It is expected that Mr Forsyth will expand on his plans to give more
responsibility to councils when he reveals the Tory Party's proposals for the
future of government in Scotland on St Andrew's Day.
Convention president Rosemary McKenna renewed her recent plea for a more stable
environment in which central and local government could work in partnership.
Council leaders have been smarting under a series of attacks by Ministers, who
claimed they were employing too many highly-paid officials in the new
authorities and creating top-heavy management structures.
She said the removal of the controls and the devolution of responsibility
proposed by Cosla would have two benefits. ``First it would help redress the
imbalance of responsibilities between central and local government and second
it would strengthen the accountability of local government to its communities.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said the Scottish Secretary would be studying
Cosla's suggestions and would be responding in due course.

WHICHEVER way you look at it, the Prince of Wales is in an agonising quandary.
In theory he has three options: he can remain married; he can divorce the
Princess of Wales and become a permanent bachelor; or he can divorce and
remarry.
Option One looks increasingly unlikely, particularly in the wake of the
Dianorama interview. When, in the House of Commons on December 9, 1992, Mr John
Major announced the Prince and Princess of Wales's decision to separate, he
said ``their constitutional positions are unaffected'', adding that there was
``no reason why the Princess of Wales should not be crowned Queen in due
course''.
In strictly constitutional terms this is true but even three years ago the
possibility looked rather unrealistic. Moreover, the reservoir of resentment
and venom exhibited in Monday's Panorama interview must renew speculation that
a royal divorce is likely sooner rather than later.
Option Two is also constitutionally possible, although it seems unlikely that
it would be a recipe for happiness for any of the key players.
Mr Vernon Bogdanor, Britain's leading expert on the modern monarchy, declares
in his new book on the subject (The Monarchy and the Constitution, OUP): ``A
divorce between the Prince and Princess of Wales would prevent the Princess of
Wales becoming Queen . . . but it would have no other constitutional
consequences.''
Although the sovereign is Supreme Governor of the Church of England, in 1992
the Archbishop of Canterbury said the title carried no legal requirements. The
Church today accepts that divorce is sometimes a regrettable necessity, by
contrast with its position during the 1936 abdication crisis.
Besides, says Mr Bogdanor, there is a precedent: in 1714 George I, although
divorced, succeeded to the throne. Also, you could say that the Church of
England was born out of a royal divorce, that of Henry VIII.
The problem with Option Two is that it would appear to condemn the Prince of
Wales to living a lie for the rest of his life, in a way that ``ordinary
people'' these days would not tolerate.
Lord Charteris, permanent Lord-in-Waiting to the Queen, tells us that Mrs
Camilla Parker Bowles is ``the love of his (the prince's) life''. On the face
of it, nothing would be more natural than for the two to marry once their
respective divorces had come through.
However, as the prince's great-uncle discovered to his cost, a royal marriage
is an act of state in which many parties have a say: Government, Opposition,
the Commonwealth, public opinion, and, last but not least, the Queen.
``The remarriage of a divorced heir to the throne poses a more difficult
problem,'' says Mr Bogdanor.
This is a delicate way of saying that Option Three is a constitutional
minefield. The main problem is the shambolic 1772 Royal Marriages Act, which
basically obliges members of the royal family to obtain the approval of
Parliament. Any marriage contracted in defiance of this rule, such as that of
the future George IV to Mrs Fitzherbert, his mistress, is void.
The Act is so archaic and badly drafted that it is not entirely clear whether
Prince Charles is subject to it. Even if he isn't, there is reason to believe
that Charles and Camilla would get every bit as bumpy a ride as Edward and Mrs
Simpson did in the 1930s.
Option Three can really be divided into two. Part One is that Charles could
contract a ``morganatic marriage''. If the Prince of Wales does ever decide to
divorce and remarry, we are destined to hear a lot of this word.
Mr Bogdanor defines such a marriage as ``one in which the wife of the sovereign
and any children who may be born of the marriage are denied royal status and
all the claims or privileges that go with it''.
The term is derived from the German ``Morgen'' (morning) and is a reference to
the ``morning gift'', which was once a traditional gift from the bridegroom to
his new wife after their first night together, a sort of
morning-after-the-night-before present.
In a morganatic marriage, the wife receives nothing beyond this post-nuptial
token. In this case, Mrs Parker Bowles would become Mrs Windsor but not Queen
Camilla.
In his new book, Mr Bogdanor reveals that Edward VIII at one point conceived of
a morganatic marriage as a solution to his dilemma. The idea was apparently
suggested to Mrs Simpson by Mr Esmond Harmsworth, the then editor of the Daily
Mail.
In the event, the King abandoned the notion when it became clear that the
dominions would not support it and that the British Government was not prepared
to introduce the necessary legislation.
Mr Bogdanor says in any case morganatic marriages have no place in the British
constitution. They were more common in Europe, he says, where sovereigns were
required to marry someone from ``a narrowly specific range of royal families''.
The final option would be for Charles to marry his Camilla and brave out his
critics. Harold Brooks-Baker, a seasoned pundit, has suggested that if the
prince waited five or 10 years before remarrying, the public reaction would be
relatively minimal.
Yet the one sentiment that seemed to unite all those who gave their response to
Monday's Panorama interview was a fervent desire not to see Camilla installed
as Queen.
Of course there is a further option, which is now discussed with the sort of
openness that would have been considered scandalous 10 years ago: the Republic
of Great Britain.

BBC reporter Martin Bashir, who spoke with the Princess of Wales in a
history-making interview on Monday night, could be set up for life within six
months if he makes the most of his world scoop, publicity guru Max Clifford
said yesterday.
The fact that the princess trusted him enough to give such a revealing and
personal portrait of her life as part of the royal family for the first time
has sent his own star into orbit.
Mr Bashir could walk into any job as a heavyweight television interviewer but
make even better money as a freelance working for the highest bidder.
Mr Clifford said: ``It is obviously a world scoop and if he wanted to go to the
States now he would certainly be able to interview the biggest stars in the
world.''
Yesterday, BBC chiefs were deciding what to do with the #1m estimated profit
generated by the Panorama interview. They said the copyright on the one-hour
interview was indisputably the BBC's and that no request had come from the
princess for part of the profits to go to her charities.
ABC News is rumoured to have paid #642,000 for exclusive screening rights in
the United States and 12 other broadcasters around the world have also signed
deals.
Meanwhile James Hewitt, the former cavalry officer with whom Princess Diana
admitted having an affair, maintained a low profile at his media-besieged home
yesterday near Okehampton, Devon.
Mr Hewitt told local police that he had no intention of making any statements
to waiting reporters.
Reporters' cars caused hold-ups on the narrow country lanes around Mr Hewitt's
secluded home.

Real or imagined, the Princess of Wales's foes make up a formidable array of
friends at court, writes William Russell
IF truth were told, she has been sleeping with ``the enemy'', although not for
quite some time. So who else, the Prince of Wales apart, did Princess Diana
have in mind on Monday night when she talked of ``the enemy''?
The answer is simple enough - the royal household and those so-called
``friends'' who keep talking to the media about the prince's feelings on love
and marriage.
Outside the household, Prince Charles's close friends include two who have been
prominent in speaking out this time around.
They do so, they insist, without being asked and without his permission, but
unless they had his tacit consent and were saying what he wanted said they
would not remain friends for long.
One is Mr Nicholas Soames, the slimline Minister, another the campaigner Sir
Jonathon Porritt, who advises the prince on green matters. The loquacious
Porritt, Eton and Magdalen College, who is 45, stood for the Ecology Party in
the 1979 and 1983 General Elections and the 1979 and 1984 European elections.
The enemies were yesterday offering a flag of truce, although the princess
might well recall the necessity to beware Greeks bearing gifts.
It was intended to be a constructive gesture, because if one thing must have
struck the palace about the Panorama interview, it was the words ``She will not
go quietly''.
The statement also made it clear that the palace was not going to enter into a
public debate, and that questions regarding the Waleses private lives were
essentially a matter for them and their close family. ``We are not going to be
drawn into discussion in this area,'' it concluded.
It seems a pity that the palace press office failed a year ago, when Prince
Charles unburdened his heart on television, to get this message about private
family affairs across to him.
Yesterday, however, one of the so-called enemy, the press office - presided
over by the urbane Mr Charles Anson, Lancing and Jesus, a former diplomat and
Downing Street spokesman turned courtier - was doing its best to stand aloof
from the vulgar royal brawling.
The princess's conception of the press office as belonging to her enemies there
probably stems from the fact that the palace press office is not there to act
in the understood public relations sense. It is a hive of courtiers who
stage-manage royal tours, help prepare the anodyne royal speeches, and present
the media with the blandest of faces whenever anything really interesting
happens.
The response to whether the Queen would be watching Panorama was that she did
not watch television, rather than that she could not since she would be at
another auto-da-fe, the Royal Variety Performance.
The pomposity is explained by the fact that they are courtiers first, public
relations persons a long way behind, and since their first job is to protect
the Queen, the needs of the Princess of Wales come way down the list of
obligations.
The enemy also includes her brother-in-law, the Queen's private secretary, Sir
Robert Fellowes, Eton and the Guards, who is married to the former Lady Jane
Spencer. It is his advice on which the Queen relies and he is one of the people
who, the princess clearly considers, blocked her plans to travel abroad and
become an ambassador for Britain.
He may well have had her mail intercepted but her suspicions could simply stem
from the normal interference of a secretary sorting incoming mail. The chances
of the princess slitting her own letters open each day is remote.
As far as the Prince of Wales is concerned, he has his own press office and his
own household. His private secretary, Commander Richard Aylard, Queen
Elizabeth's Grammar School, Barnet, and Reading University, has been with the
Wales household since 1985, first as an equerry to the princess from 1985 to
1988 and then assistant private secretary to 1991.
Private secretaries must represent their master's interests and nobody
questions his abilities, so he must be top of her list in spite of their past
association.
The assistant private secretaries, Mr Matthew Butler and Dr Manon Williams,
however, are another matter. They are chosen for their knowledge of the
different fields in which the prince takes an interest and are not there to
advise him on how to handle his wife.
There is a deputy private secretary, Mr Stephen Lamport and an equerry, Major
Paddy Tabor, both potential enemies.
His press secretary, Mr Alan Percival, and his deputy, Ms Sandy Henney, will be
enemies simply because their job is to promote her husband's activities.
However, the real power lies with people like Sir Robert, his deputy, Sir
Kenneth Scott, and the assistant private secretary, Mr Robin Janvrin, with
those shadowy courtiers who make up the inner household and have the Queen's
ear.
Also - although she has never been known to say anything but gets photographed
often enough to be a problem - enemy number one is undoubtedly the surrogate
mum, the bouncy Ms Tiggy Legge-Bourke, whom Prince Charles has brought in to
help him with his sons.

profiles the
`professional toff' who
has emerged as the
prince's champion
WITHIN hours of throwing his considerable weight behind his friend the Prince
of Wales, Mr Nicholas Soames was under fire from all sides. The Armed Forces
Minister was accused of gross misjudgment for describing Princess of Wales as
paranoid.
The ferocity of his attack on the princess, coming from one of the best-known
and brightly dressed figures in Charles's small circle of friends, belied the
reputation of this larger-than-life Tory as one of the most genial, fun-loving,
and affable MPs in the Commons.
On Newsnight immediately after the princess's dramatic Panorama interview, and
again yesterday on the Today programme, Mr Soames was the voice of the
Establishment, pooh-poohing her allegations and rubbishing her credibility with
a few well-chosen words.
She was showing ``the advanced stages of paranoia'', he said. Her claims that
the royal household conspires against her were ``absolute nonsense'', and her
admission of adultery was just ``toe-curlingly awful''.
However, his stout defence of the prince has come at a price. Cabinet Ministers
refused to back his remarks, leaving the impression that as a member of the
Government he had spoken out of turn. Labour announced it would write to the
Prime Minister asking if it was acceptable for the Minister responsible for the
Army to rubbish the colonel-in-chief of two royal regiments.
Yesterday, even those whose instinctive sympathies lie with the prince were
accusing Mr Soames of unwittingly confirming the princess's claim that her
husband's friends were ``the enemy'', out to destroy her by labelling her as
unstable.
In the Times, Mr William Rees-Mogg, a fellow pillar of the Establishment,
wrote: ``In contrast to the princess, he immediately appeared as a blustering
fool, a grotesque confirmation of everything she had been implying about the
inadequacy and malice of the royal establishment. He made himself the living
proof of what she had said.''
The Hon Arthur Nicholas Winston Soames, 6ft 3in and a good 15 stone in his
impeccably tailored suits, has known Charles since childhood.
His background and interests make him a natural courtier. Grandson of Winston
Churchill, son of Christopher Soames of Rhodesia fame, educated at Eton and in
the 11th Hussars, Mr Soames is a proud member of the shooting, nannies, and
sticky-pudding classes.
In Who's Who, he lists country pursuits as his preferred recreation.
His relationship with the prince is close and he has always been willing to
champion the heir's cause. The bonds were forged between 1970 and 1972, when he
served as Prince Charles's equerry.
The prince in turn was best man at his first wedding in 1980, to Catherine
Weatherall. Lady Diana Spencer was there as well. The marriage ended in divorce
in 1988. Gossip has it that the now ex-Mrs Soames was a close friend of the
princess. Mr Soames, 47, remarried in 1993.
His CV suggests he has never had to look far for something to do. After the
Army, and his two years with the prince, he worked variously as personal
assistant for Sir James Goldsmith and as an investment adviser, while
struggling to become an MP. In 1979, he stood in Central Dunbartonshire.
In 1983, he fought and held on to Crawley, a marginal seat in the London
stockbroker belt. As a back bench MP, he developed a reputation as a loud,
colourful bon viveur, noted for the violent colour of his socks and the
extravagant cut of his suits.
At dinner with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, conversation was halted when
she was noticed staring transfixed at his yellow footwear.
In 1992, he was made Minister for Food, an inspired promotion that delighted
him and led to a distinct sobering in his attire. The appointment was apt. A
devoted trencherman, known as the Crawley Food Mountain, Mr Soames was made for
the role.
With the Bunteresque bellow of a professional toff, Mr Soames is an
enthusiastic participant in parliamentary heckling. He can claim credit for the
``mine's a large gin and tonic, Giovanni'' line shouted at John Prescott every
time the ex-ship's steward rises to his feet.
And when millionaire MP Tim Sainsbury remarked on his extravagant tweed suit by
calling out ``going ratting, Soames?'', he replied: ``I say, imagine being
lectured about your gear by your grocer.''
This year, he has tried a crash diet, shedding pounds on a regime that excludes
his favourite puddings, sauces, and heavy wines in favour of an apple and salad
at lunch.
For a man with a formidable reputation as a gourmand, the sacrifice has been
considerable. He has shed many pounds but not the Establishment triple chin and
jowls that wobbled in fury for the prince. He may find that the loyalty of the
courtier is incompatible with the career of a politician.

Chris Holme talks to psychiatric experts about the princess and
mental disorder
THE swift denunciation of the Princess of Wales as being in the grip of the
``advanced stages of paranoia'' was just as swiftly denounced yesterday.
It was a ridiculous thing to say, according to Dr Susan Llewelyn, who explained
that there is no such illness as paranoia.
``It doesn't exist in any textbook of psychiatry. What it is taken to mean is
that you are being persecuted and it's in those terms that it's being applied
here,'' she said.
Dr Llewelyn, a psychiatrist at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, said paranoid
delusions were a symptom in a variety of mental illnesses. They occur, for
instance, in dementia or schizophrenia.
``It's a belief that you are special in some ways and that things have special
significance. It is not being used correctly here,'' she said.
Delusions of persecution were common, as were other forms of delusions in those
suffering from severe mental illnesses.
``But it's used as a kind of pop shorthand to talk about feelings of
persecution. So far as the interview with the princess is concerned, it is a
ridiculous thing to say.
``What they presumably mean is that she feels persecuted, which is quite a
different thing, and the use of the word paranoid is being used here
inappropriately,'' she added.
The term was used by Mr Nicholas Soames, a close friend of the Prince of Wales,
in the wake of the Panorama interview, a comment which was seen by some as
merely confirming the princess's account of palace life and her ``enemies'' in
the prince's camp always ready to attack and belittle her.
However, there was a welter of broader support for her yesterday as a result of
other revelations about her episodes of mental illness.
The interview was unprecedented for someone of her public prominence to admit
suffering any psychiatric disorder, let alone a catalogue. She spoke of her
unhappy childhood, post-natal depression when Prince William was born,
self-inflicted injuries to her arms and legs, and her struggle with bulimia.
Ms Claire Walker, spokeswoman for the Scottish Association for Mental Health,
said: ``What was really heartening for organisations like ourselves was that
here was a woman with an extremely high profile who is an icon of her age and
who has spoken about the kind of mental distress she has suffered.
``This can only help other people discuss their problems in their own setting
and assist in destigmatising mental illness.''
Mr Alex McMahon, spokesman for the Royal College of Nursing in Scotland and a
former psychiatric nurse, said the princess was seen as a role model by many
girls and young women.
``Her interview makes mental illness more acceptable in other people's lives.
It took a lot of courage to admit to it before an audience of more than 20
million people. It certainly took more courage than it did for the other things
she admitted to.''
In revealing the complexity of her psychiatric problems, the princess also
highlighted a little-known disorder, self-mutilation.
An estimated 10,000 people in Britain deliberately and regularly injure
themselves. In more extreme forms, the illness dates back to Vincent van Gogh,
who cut off his ear.
``Perhaps they'll listen now,'' was the conclusion of Don McLean's ballad,
Vincent. The impact of the Panorama interview makes it impossible not to.

JAMES HEWITT maintained a low profile at home yesterday after the Princess of
Wales's TV admission of their affair.
The former cavalry officer stayed indoors as the media besieged his house,
Eversfield Manor, at Bratton Clovelly, near Okehampton, Devon.
Mr Hewitt told local police that he had no intention of making any statements
to waiting reporters.
No-one living in the area was willing to criticise Mr Hewitt over his
relationship with the princess.
One local man said: ``We treat him with respect and he treats us with respect.
We don't see that much of him. He is busy at the house preparing his equestrian
centre.
``He just gets on with his life and we get on with ours.''
Reporters' cars caused hold-ups on the narrow country lanes around Mr Hewitt's
secluded home. Farmers, buses, and the local milkman continued business as
normal.
Police were present to ensure journalists kept off Mr Hewitt's land.
Attempts by reporters to deliver notes and letters to him were also thwarted.

A MAN'S six-year campaign to learn more about the death of his father is to be
raised in the European Parliament.
Mr Edward McColm's father, James, died two days after being struck by a taxi in
his home town of Stevenston, Ayrshire, in July 1989. The circumstances were
investigated by police who then reported to the procurator-fiscal.
The case was marked ``no proceedings'' which meant that there would be neither
criminal prosecution nor a fatal accident inquiry.
Mr McColm, of Morrison Avenue, Stevenston, and his brother, John, wanted to
know more but were consistently told that it would ``not be in the public
interest'' to make further information available.
So began a campaign which has been debated at Westminster as well as in the
columns of The Herald and will now be investigated by the European Commission
and reported to MEPs.
Mr McColm, 44, is seeking two changes in the procedures surrounding deaths such
as those of this father - firstly that the Lord Advocate should have less
discretion in ordering an FAI and secondly that information should be freely
available to relatives and interested parties.
He said: ``The loss of a loved one in tragic circumstances is difficult enough
to cope with but it is made even worse when information is not made available
about the circumstances.
``We made a perfectly reasonable request for an inquiry into my father's death.
It was refused and we were not given access to information about what happened
that night.
``It is part of the grieving process for relatives to know as much as humanly
possible about how a loved one died. We have many questions that remain
unanswered.''
Mr McColm has had a petition accepted by the European Parliament.
He added: ``I am convinced that the failure of the Crown authorities to provide
information freely is a breach of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In
addition to that, if the taxi driver had died, there would have been an FAI as
he was at work and if my father had died in England there would have been an
inquest.
``There is no question of us looking for secrets here. We are looking for
information which will complete the jigsaw of how an elderly man died on the
way home from his social club.''
The case has been taken up by local MP Brian Donohoe, who said: ``I will be
monitoring the progress in the European Parliament and be ready to discuss the
possibility of further discussion in the Commons.''
Mr Alex Smith, MEP for the South of Scotland, is also supporting Mr McColm.

A MONKLANDS councillor yesterday admitted to the Government inquiry into
employment practices that eight of his relatives had at one time worked for the
local authority.
Councillor Jim Smith told the inquiry that this figure included his wife Jane,
who, he said, had become so stressed by the Monklands affair that she was
suffering from multiple sclerosis and had given up her job on doctor's advice.
Councillor Smith said his wife had worked as a cleaner-caretaker, while two of
his daughters, Mrs Elizabeth Ward and Catriona Smith, were clerical assistants.
The list also featured a niece, Audrey Johnston (housing officer), a nephew
Christopher Smith (a technical services apprentice who had since left), his
sister-in-law Mrs Ellen Heckford (part-time caretaker-cleaner), his
brother-in-law James Punty (part-time caretaker), and son-in-law Simon Ward
(administration assistant).
The inquiry, at the council headquarters in Coatbridge, has heard that green
application forms were used by councillors to denote a favoured job applicant.
Investigating chairman Mr William Nimmo-Smith, QC, said yesterday that green
forms had been used for Mrs Smith, Mrs Ward, and Mrs Smith's sister, Mrs
Heckford.
Councillor Smith said he was shocked to discover the use of the green forms,
which he had not endorsed. He said he certainly had not asked for any of his
family to get favourable treatment.
He was questioned closely on how his daughter Catriona - a trained florist -
had got her job on Monklands as a clerical assistant in December 1994.
Councillor Smith said Catriona was looking for work in June that year so he
asked the head of human resources management, Mr Ian Crawford, if there were
any vacancies.
Mr Crawford gave him a form (the colour was not specified) for Catriona to
complete and that was held on file as there were no vacancies.
Then, out of the blue, he said, Catriona was given an interview date. She went
along and was given the job, he said.
Councillor Smith said that with hindsight perhaps someone else other than Mr
Crawford should have been involved. But he added: ``Mr Crawford took the task
upon himself, rightly or wrongly.''
Mr Nimmo-Smith asked Councillor Smith if that was normal procedure for filling
such a vacancy.
He replied: ``I didn't particularly question Mr Crawford. He is the
professional. I didn't want to interfere. Maybe I should have, but I thought
she got the job on merit because she is a very capable girl.''
The inquiry also heard yesterday from council leader Councillor James Brooks,
who apologised for giving misleading written evidence by failing to declare two
relatives in a list of past and present family members employed by the
authority.
He was asked to explain why he had omitted to declare the two relatives.
In his first letter to the inquiry, Councillor Brooks declared four relatives
were Monklands employees: his son Stephen, daughter Angela, sister-in-law
Isobel McGuire, and Robert Reid, his wife's brother-in-law.
However, he did not mention a second son, James Brooks, or Stephen's future
wife, Fiona Loughran, until he sent a second letter to the inquiry.
He said in the second letter that James was a former employee, but had
emigrated more than two years ago, and because he had left did not consider him
relevant to the inquiry. At the time Fiona got her job, he did not know her, he
said.
The councillor added: ``I did not consider them to be relevant. I could not
possibly have foreseen that I would have had a daughter-in-law when Fiona was
employed here.''
Reminding him that the original inquiry letter asked for past or present family
employees, Mr Nimmo-Smith said: ``It's a perfectly straightforward question;
why can you not give me a straightforward answer?''
When Councillor Brooks protested that he had sent a second letter explaining
everything, Mr Nimmo-Smith said by then the inquiry had obtained the
information from ``other sources''.
Councillor Brooks said: ``Can I apologise for misleading you?''
However, he denied he or anyone else had used their positions to influence any
of the appointments. He knew of no nepotism or religious bias on the council
and he rebutted suggestions that Labour Party membership enhanced job or
promotion prospects.
The inquiry continues.

FORMER Education Secretary John Patten last night attacked the Government's
divorce law reforms which he warned would ``prime a terrible social and moral
timebomb'' and make Britain ``the divorce capital of the world''.
He told Ministers, during the Queen's Speech debate, that he could not support
the reforms which introduce the concept of no-fault divorce.
Mr Patten, a Roman Catholic, said facts showed children from unbroken families
did better in school and committed less crime.
Mr Patten warned that the divorce reforms could be dangerous for Tories in the
run-up to the next election by alienating supporters.
THE Government last night moved to launch a new wave of oil and gas exploration
off Britain by offering firms the opportunity to enter areas hardly touched so
far. Junior Energy Minister Richard Page, announcing 275 blocks in 68 tranches
under the seventeenth offshore licensing round, said in a written reply that
most are to the west of Scotland, but there are some in the South West
Approaches, the northern North Sea and off England's east coast .Mr Page said:
``We are entering real frontier territory with some of the tranches nearly as
far west as Rockall.''
ARMED Forces Minister Nicholas Soames last night was at the centre of Labour
claims that he has admitted the Government is failing young people and has no
policies to deliver work or opportunities to them. Labour Employment spokesman
Ian McCartney has written to Education and Employment Secretary Gillian
Shephard, asking her to confirm Mr Soames' comments on BBC2's Newsnight
programme on Monday night, when he spoke of the work undertaken with the young
unemployed by the Prince of Wales and added that it: ``Keeps many more people
in work than the Government scheme does.''

TWO Scots Guards acted within the law when they shot at a Belfast teenager, the
Northern Ireland Court of Appeal was told yesterday.
Peter McBride, 18, died in the shooting in the city's New Lodge area in
September 1992.
Guardsmen James Fisher, 28, from Ayrshire, and Mark Wright, 22, from Arbroath,
are appealing their conviction for murder.
They were convicted by Lord Justice Basil Kelly in a non-jury trial at Belfast
Crown Court last February and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Lord Kelly rejected the soldiers' claims that they thought Mr McBride was
carrying a ``coffee jar'' bomb in a plastic bag. Mr Peter Smith QC, appearing
for Fisher, yesterday told the three appeal judges: ``If a soldier thinks that
a person is running away with a coffee-jar bomb it is reasonable for him to
shoot if he does not stop.''
He said that nowhere in Lord Kelly's 126-page judgment did he ask the question:
``Was there anything Mr McBride was carrying that could have been mistaken for
a bomb?''
He said the judge had waited seven months from the end of the trial until after
the House of Lords verdict in the case of Paratrooper Lee Clegg before he
delivered judgment.
``That could only mean that he was prepared to entertain a reasonable doubt
that the soldiers were justified in opening fire,'' said Mr Smith.
The appeal continues today.

A REGISTERED Aberdeen gun dealer and oil businessman was sentenced for firearms
offences yesterday.
Barry Buchanan, 48, of Hamilton Place, Aberdeen, appeared on indictment at the
city's sheriff court and admitted assaulting a man in Hamilton Place last
September.
He also admitted failing to keep a number of firearms properly stored at his
home and illegally possessing a .243 semi-automatic rifle and a gas spray.
Buchanan's not guilty pleas to three other charges, including an allegation he
had 30 firearms at his home which had not been registered, were accepted by the
Crown.
Sheriff Alex Pollock ordered Buchanan to perform 200 hours' community service.
The court previously heard that after an argument with his girlfriend, Buchanan
grabbed a Winchester shotgun, held it at his side and told the man she'd been
out with that night ``brace yourself'' then pulled the trigger on the empty
weapon.
Defence advocate Murdo MacLeod said Buchanan, a first offender, ``lost
control'' after seeing his girlfriend in a hotel with the man.
Buchanan was ``deeply ashamed of his action'' and had had his gun dealer's
licence revoked, Mr MacLeod said.
Sheriff Pollock told Buchanan ``those involved in firearms carry obligations to
society'' and forfeited the guns and ammunition.

A HOMELESS Person's Charter for Scotland - which explains the problems of
homeless people and proposes action on a number of fronts - was presented to
MPs by a group of homeless Scots at Westminster yesterday.
The charter, which was compiled by members of the Speakout group, recommends
several changes to help homeless people, such as:
q The introduction of a statutory right to a home and the changing of the Code
of Guidance on the Homeless Persons' legislation from discretionary to
statutory.
q An end to ``discrimination'' against homeless people and a guarantee that all
homeless people should have a right to a GP and the same health services as is
received by others.
q The setting up of a National Hostels Inspectorate and the closure of hostels
if they fail to meet certain standards.
q The training of staff in sectors such as housing, health, and benefits to
ensure they do not discriminate against homeless people.
The charter also calls on the Government to give greater spending priority to
investment in affordable rented housing.

<HEADLINE>Survey reveals move towards support for Scottish parliament - without tax-raising powers Business chiefs back home rule</HEADLINE>

ALMOST two-thirds of business leaders now support a Scottish parliament, or
have an open mind on the idea, but they are against giving it tax-raising
powers, according to a survey of chambers of commerce.
The survey was seized on by Government and Opposition parties alike as evidence
of support for their stance, but behind the political mud-flinging the survey
did appear to show that, at the very least, past hostility to constitutional
change among business people seems to be mellowing.
The exercise, entitled Constitutional Canvass, was conducted by the Fraser of
Allander Institute for the Scottish Chambers of Commerce with the support of
law firm Maclay Murray &amp; Spens, but only 19% of the 3500 members chose to
respond.
This was double the response rate for a survey in 1991 in which 67% of
businesses said they supported the status quo.
Now 88% say the business environment would be better or no worse off if there
was greater decision-making in Scotland and 65% say this of an elected
legislature.
Mr Peter Dunn, acting director general of Scottish Chambers, said the survey
showed ``a tidal move'' in attitudes and posed questions for all political
parties, not least the Government, with whom current relationships were not
working as well as they should.
The figure for support or cautious acceptance slips to 31% and hostility
doubles to 69% if the legislature has tax-raising powers.
The question did not specify the 3p variation in income tax specified in the
constitutional convention scheme, leading to claims yesterday that some might
have feared a change in business taxes.
More than 74% believed they would be worse off with independence, with 12%
seeing potential benefits and 13.5% believing there would be no change - a
combined figure of more than 25%.
Concern was expressed by the SNP that the question did not refer to their
policy of independence in Europe.
Another finding in the survey was that those companies that did most business
with local government expressed greatest concern at the damage to their
business inflicted by the current reorganisation.
The main disagreement yesterday came between Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
and his Labour Shadow George Robertson.
Mr Forsyth insisted there was egg on Opposition faces because of the hostility
to a parliament with taxation powers.
``For firms with 400 or more employees, opposition rises to 77%. Labour's
proposals are seen as leading to higher operating costs by 67% of respondents.
If George Robertson thinks that this is `excellent news', he has very modest
expectations,'' he said.
Mr Robertson said the 88% rejection of the status quo was ``a humiliation for
the Government position and a slap in the face for Michael Forsyth'', while the
65% of executives coming round to a devolved Scottish parliament was a
``staggering movement in opinion'' since the last election.
The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Jim Wallace, said the principal
finding was that Scottish businesses were in favour of political and economic
decisions being made in Scotland.
``The survey nails firmly the myth that our business community is wholly
opposed to constitutional reform,'' Mr Wallace said.
``The vast majority of people in business now reject both the status quo and
the independence option.''
Mr Fergus Ewing, SNP business spokesman, said 25% support or acceptance of the
independence case was a good result in a hostile sector and the shift in
opinion was in their favour, both in business and the larger community.
``This survey also indicates that it is small business, and international
business based in Scotland, which is most likely to support constitutional
change. These sectors tend to be the most entrepreneurial and are likely to see
advantages first,'' he said.
Mr Cliff Lockyer of the Fraser of Allander Institute faced questions over the
wording of the questions, the size of the sample, and whether the previous
survey's wording might have been replicated to give a direct comparison.
He stressed that they were asking for business judgments, not political
opinions, and he defended the survey as ``robust''.
Some businessmen take the fatalistic line that their business is in Scotland
irrespective of what kind of government there is, so they will just get on with
it.
The supreme example of that must be the Scotch Whisky Association.
As a spokesman said yesterday: ``We have to be in Scotland. That's the end of
it. We deal with governments in 200 countries around the world, so we can deal
with one in Scotland whatever its political persuasion.''
ScottishPower takes a similar view. ``We would clearly work within any system
set up by a democratically elected government,'' an official said.
``The Labour Party has consulted us about their proposals and we emphasised the
overriding need that any new system should not harm the competitive ability of
Scottish-based companies by imposing extra tax burdens on them.''

<HEADLINE>Hospitals to get more private cash</HEADLINE>

MORE private cash will be used to build hospitals and modernise existing ones,
freeing up public money to pay for health care, the Government announced
yesterday.
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell immediately emphasised that it did not mean
the Government was set on privatising delivery of NHS clinical services.
The basic principle of universal health care, free at the point of delivery and
largely paid for by taxes, would continue, he said in a speech at the Royal
College of Physicians in London.
Encouraging private companies to invest in buildings and support services is
part of the Private Finance Initiative - set up three years ago by then
Chancellor Norman Lamont.
Mr Dorrell, who was a Treasury Minister when the scheme was launched, said he
was strongly in favour of testing public and private sector solutions alongside
each other and adopting the approach which offers best value. A raft of schemes
is expected to be unveiled in the next few months.
Mr Dorrell said: ``The PFI is not intended to herald a new period of upheaval
in the NHS.
``The trust itself will continue to be the direct employer of clinical staff.
It is no part of the Government's policy to transfer the delivery of NHS
clinical services into the private sector.
``The PFI is about the provision of supporting facilities. It sets out to
ensure that they are modern and efficient as we can make them by
sub-contracting responsibility for their provision to specialist managers who
are expert at providing them.''
The Health Secretary said by sub-contracting responsibility for the design,
construction and operation of the building and support services, a trust could
focus its activities on the efficient provision of high-quality clinical
services.

ANGRY south of Scotland MPs yesterday told Defence Minister Lord Howe that the
number of low-level RAF flights over the area must be cut.
The Minister admitted that, while such flights have been cut by 30% in other
training areas, they have risen again to 1988 levels in the south.
The Borders tactical training area covers Ayrshire, Dumfries and Galloway,
Clydesdale and the Borders.
Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley - Lab.) said that in the
last nine months the number of complaints about low flying in the region had
risen by 46%.
He and the other MPs - Sir David Steel (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale -Lib.
Dem.), Mr Archy Kirkwood (Roxburgh and Berwickshire - Lib. Dem.) and Sir Hector
Monro (Dumfries - Con.) told the Minister they were not prepared to put up with
the area taking more than its share of low flights, with RAF and other Nato
aircraft flying at heights of 250ft and 100ft above the ground.
The Minister agreed to investigate ways of reducing flights in the area.
Mr Foulkes said he believed the Border area got more flights because it was
more convenient for the air force. ``But I am getting stories of animal births
aborted, children frightened, vehicles driven off the road. There must be a
reduction.''

THE Liberal Democrats said yesterday that they would vote to reverse any 1p cut
in income tax in the Budget to provide extra funds for education, (writes
Stuart Trotter).
Their alternative Budget included plans to remove 750,000 people from the
income tax system by taking them out of the 20p band and a #130 rebate for
electricity consumers. Earnings over #100,000 would be taxed at 50p in the
pound.
Party leader Paddy Ashdown said: ``The Government will pretend next week that
cutting taxes increases choice. But cutting taxes increases choice only for a
few. Real choice depends on opportunity and real opportunity springs from a
decent education.''
The party expects the Chancellor to inrease the education budget by 2% in real
terms and is calling for an extra #2.5bn on top of that to make real
improvements to the system and start clearing the backlog in building repairs.
Its finance spokesman, Mr Malcolm Bruce, said: ``How can the Chancellor justify
tax cuts this year when last year, with the same level of public borrowing, he
was having to put taxes up.''
The Liberal Democrats Environment spokesman, Mr Matthew Taylor, said they were
against windfall taxes and preferred to compensate Britain's 22 million
electricity consumers directly through a ``rip-off rebate'' worth #130.

Palace calls truce with princess
BUCKINGHAM Palace yesterday held out an olive branch to the Princess of Wales
in the wake of her Panorama interview, promising to hold talks with her.
In a move likely to be seen as a conciliatory gesture, senior royal aides said
they wanted ``to see how we can help her define her future role and continue to
support her as a member of the royal family''.
Mr Major had a private meeting with the Queen to try to sort out the crisis.
The Princess of Wales is flying to Argentina tonight on a private visit on one
of her charity causes, invited by President Carlos Menem.
The palace move came as controversy continued over the princess's declaration,
watched by 21 million viewers in Britain alone, that she did not want a divorce
but would ``fight to the end'' to keep a royal role.
Public figures and ordinary people were equally divided, particularly about her
confession of adultery with former cavalry officer James Hewitt. She also
accused her husband and other royal family members of not understanding her
``cries for help'' in the form of ``rampant bulimia'' and her self-inflicted
injuries to her arms and legs.
The Prime Minister is insisting that the constitutional situation is unchanged
from his statement to the Commons last December, announcing the official
separation of Prince Charles and his wife.
However, her stance as the injured wife and her declaration that she will not
go quietly has produced what appears an entirely different constitutional
situation, particularly as she added that she does not see herself as being
queen with King Charles. This is seen as a bargaining counter for a divorce
settlement.
Yesterday the Prime Minister was not challenged on this developing situation at
Commons Questions, but Labour MPs are beginning to mount a challenge to the
Government's position.
Two demanded the resignation of Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames for
claiming the princess was showing ``advanced stages of paranoia''.
Mr Soames, a member of Prince Charles's closest circle of friends, launched
into his outspoken attack moments after she bared her soul in the interview.
Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, said he
thought Mr Soames should return to the back benches.
``There are a lot of delicate constitutional matters in relation to what the
Princess of Wales said which Ministers ought to keep out of. Nicholas Soames's
intervention has put him in a very difficult position.''
Mr Andrew Mackinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, went further. ``Nicholas Soames
should be fired. He should never have trespassed into this matter last night.
``Within minutes of the Princess of Wales saying the Establishment was out to
get her, he joined the chorus to disparage her. It gives credence to the very
complaints she made that the Establishment is out to diminish her in the public
eye.
``Now, as a Minister of the Crown, he should never have said that. It is not
his business to do so, and the Prime Minister has got to sack him.''
Earlier, Downing Street said Mr Soames had been speaking, on BBC2's Newsnight
programme, in a personal capacity. Pressed whether Mr Soames retained Mr
Major's confidence, a Downing Street spokesman said: ``As a Minister, he
certainly has the confidence of the Prime Minister.''
Mr Soames had said: ``I cannot account for what she was talking about when she
referred to mail interception and telephones being tapped. It really is the
advanced stages of paranoia.''
The Buckingham Palace statement that the princess is to be offered talks
indicates that the Queen is taking seriously the proposition of a royal divorce.
The princess is supported by funds from her husband's Duchy estates. Her public
relations support has been withdrawn for any further activities that she has
declared she wants to continue.
Serious divorce negotiations might be about to begin, particularly after the
judgment of Lord Blake, the Tory constitutional expert, that the present
situation after the broadcast ``will not do''.
Meanwhile, author Andrew Morton said she was planning more interviews.
These include one for overseas media and at least one for charities, it was
understood.
The princess admitted on Panorama that she authorised friends to speak to Mr
Morton for his book about her marriage troubles. He said the palace olive
branch statement smacked of ``megaphone diplomacy''.

<HEADLINE>Dispute spreads over casual staff Threat to mail as  Glasgow postal workers walk out</HEADLINE>

HUNDREDS of postal workers in Glasgow last night joined an unofficial strike, a
move which could bring services in the west to a halt.
The action was prompted by colleagues in the east of Scotland.
It involved up to 400 workers at the automated processing centre at Springburn
and could cause widespread disruption in Glasgow and thoughout the west.
Postal staff walked out at around 11.30pm in support of striking colleagues
after it emerged that casual staff had been brought in to pick up air mail for
delivery through Prestwick Airport rather than Edinburgh Airport.
It is understood the night shift workers could be joined by staff from the
morning shift, causing further disruption. Earlier Royal Mail failed to obtain
interim interdict against the Communications Workers Union for failing to get
their members back to work.
One postman at the Springburn centre told The Herald early this morning the
mood of staff had been angry throughout the evening.
He said: ``The pressure had been building up during the evening and when we
realised that casual drivers were being used some sections walked out.
Eventually everyone else followed them. Everyone has had enough of management
taking liberties and we were all firmly behind workers in Edinburgh.
``This could snowball even more. If all the processing centres go out then it
could last.''
A Royal Mail spokeswoman confirmed that the majority of staff had walked out
but insisted some were still working. She said the hi-tech centre served most
of the west coast. She added: ``We are extremely disappointed that they have
chosen to take this illegal strike action which has been repudiated by their
own union.''
Workers at a meeting in Edinburgh had earlier rejected advice of their union
that they should return to work because the strike was unofficial.
Yesterday, the second day of the strike, 1200 workers at delivery offices in
Edinburgh, other parts of the Lothians, Fife, and the Borders who walked out in
the morning had been joined in the afternoon by 800 workers at the sorting
centre at the Gyle, Edinburgh.
Officials of the CWU were expected to be in talks with Royal Mail today in an
effort to find a basis of negotiation.
Even before the spread of the dispute to Glasgow about one million items of
mail awaited delivery. A total of 600 post boxes were sealed in Edinburgh.
The flashpoint of the strike was the walk-out by workers at the city's
Portobello delivery office in protest at the imposition of changes in second
deliveries by Royal Mail.
CWU divisional officer John Keggie said Royal Mail had infuriated workers by
taking executive action at Portobello without discussion between the two sides.
Mr Alex Gibb, Royal Mail's delivery director, said the action was taking place
because some people did not want Royal Mail to make changes to improve service
for customers, who wanted to get all their mail as early as possible.
``What we are determined to do is to put in place a local staffing structure
which will enable that to happen and bring them into line with the rest of
Scotland. This will be achieved without redundancies.''
Mr Gibb said Royal Mail was getting so much mail through in time for first
deliveries that in many offices it could be combined with some second
deliveries.
``What union officials want us to do is hold mail back from first delivery so
that it gets delivered later. That is unacceptable.''

DELAYS in beginning the #700m upgrading of the West Coast main line from
Glasgow to London were criticised yesterday by the European Commission.
One reason for the lack of progress is uncertainty over the Government's rail
privatisation programme.
Britain was singled out as the only EU-member state which so far has failed to
work on its share of so-called Trans European Network projects (Tens) - to give
Europe better road, rail, sea, telecommunications, and energy links for the
next century.
EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock, presenting a progress report by the
Commission yesterday, expressed disappointment with the delays.
Britain has three of the 14 projects awarded priority status by the EU. They
are:
q The West Coast line, to be linked to an upgraded rail route from Cork to
Larne via Belfast and Dublin, and subject of financing doubts;
q The London-Channel Tunnel high-speed rail link, the subject of a dispute
about funding between the Government and Brussels, and:
q Road links in Ireland, Wales, England, and the Benelux countries, delayed
because of environmental issues.
Mr Kinnock also said he would ask the Madrid summit next month for a further
#800m so that member states could speed up work on their Tens.
He added that governments never failed to recognise the benefits of Tens: ``But
good though their intentions are, member state governments have not yet backed
up their declarations with the necessary action.''
His criticisms come within a month of Transport Secretary Sir George Young
announcing that the West Coast line was to receive #7m in European funding to
pay for further feasibility studies into the work required.
However, Opposition critics protested at the possibility of only more
feasibility studies, and said the project was in tatters.
About #70bn will be spent by the EU between now and the end of the century on
Tens projects. Most of the money will be raised by member states, although the
EU will help out with soft loans and various forms of seedcorn assistance.

AN ALTERNATIVE Budget and economic programme which, it was claimed, would cut
Scottish unemployment by almost 120,000 over four years was unveiled by the SNP
yesterday. Party leader Alex Salmond said tax proposals would offer help to the
low-paid and those on average incomes, (writes Stuart Trotter).
The SNP would cut the 20% income tax rate to 15% over four years while
expanding the 25% basic rate to 40%, but raising tax thresholds so that it
would not bite until an income of #31,470 for a single person. The ceiling on
employers' National Insurance contributions would be raised. The outcome would
be to cut tax for everyone earning under #26,000.
VAT on fuel would be cut from 8% to 5%, and spirits duty by 10%
The SNP promises further investment in industry and infrastructure.
Child benefit would go up to #12, benefits would be restored to 16 and
17-year-olds, and pensions would be increased by #3 for a single person and #5
for a couple. A cold climate allowance would be developed and means-testing
stopped for residential care for the elderly.
The party says the progamme would be paid for by savings from cutting
unemployment, additional North Sea revenues, extra corporation tax from
increased growth, defence savings and Scotland's budget surplus compared with
that of the UK.

THE Prime Minister was last night dragged into the controversy surrounding the
Prince and Princess of Wales after senior Tories made it clear the only
solution to the crisis facing the monarchy is a royal divorce.
Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames, a close friend of Prince Charles, has
asked Mr Major to raise the possibility of a divorce with the Queen in his
weekly audience.
Despite criticisms that he is overstepping the limits set on him as a
Government Minister, Mr Soames said the Prince had been ``dreadfully wronged''
by the interview, and that the Princess's suggestion that her husband might
refuse the throne was ``outrageous''.
Mr Soames came under fire from Labour, with calls for his resignation, as
Buckingham Palace held out an olive branch to the Princess in the wake of her
Panorama interview, promising to hold talks with her.
In a move likely to be seen as a conciliatory gesture, senior royal aides said

A 45-MINUTE telephone conversation between the Prime Minister and Irish Premier
John Bruton yesterday failed to resolve the next stage in the Ulster peace
process.
Last night, it seemed unlikely that a London-Dublin summit can be staged before
President Clinton's visit to Britain and Ireland next week.
Mr Bruton, who had another meeting with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams yesterday,
is insisting that the peace process will founder unless the British Government
agrees to allow political talks to begin without the IRA even making a gesture
towards handing over its explosives and attack weapons.
The Prime Minister told Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble in the Commons
yesterday that the Government will not budge on offering Sinn Fein political
talks until the IRA has shifted its position on decommissioning of weapons.
Despite President Clinton's imminent visit to London, Belfast and Dublin -
which still is going ahead - the chances of a resolution to this problem look
slim.
The two Prime Ministers are due to speak again ``within the next few days'',
but Mr Major, this time with the backing of Washington, will not budge on the
decommissioning of IRA weapons.
Dublin is insisting that Mr Adams cannot deliver the IRA on a decommissioning
deal before talks begin.
Mr Bruton has told the Prime Minister that the whole peace process could be in
jeopardy unless a ``target'' date for political talks can be set.
The Prime Minster, with President Clinton's support, insists that this would be
pointless because the Ulster Unionists would boycott any such talks.
Last night the only hope of a UK-Irish summit this week was resting on the
proposition that a ``twin-track'' approach can be relaunched by Washington,
London and Dublin.
This involves an independent commission being established to look into the
practicalities of an IRA weapons handover within three months, to combine with
a start to such a decommissioning of weapons.
The sticking point last night was that Mr Bruton cannot deliver Sinn Fein into
such an agreement at this stage. Mr Adams is still holding out to use the US
President's visit next week to try to force Mr Major into another concession.
The Prime Minister would risk not only a revolt by the Ulster Unionists if he
did so - but a rebellion on his own back benches.
The projected summit could still be on this Friday, depending on whether
President Clinton is prepared to put the ultimate pressure on Sinn Fein to
commit itself to a watershed agreement.
In the Commons, Mr Major made clear the Government's stance on the
decommissioning of IRA weapons.
Mr Trimble had pressed him to confirm ``that it is and will continue to be the
policy of this Government that, before Sinn Fein-IRA can move fully into
dialogue, they must establish their commitment to exclusively peaceful methods
by beginning a credible process of actual decommissioning''.
The Prime Minister told him that Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew
had ``spelt that out'' in Washington.
Mr Major added: ``You are clearly referring to the Washington Three condition -
that remains the Government's position.''
Meanwhile, Mr Bruton insisted that there could be no UK-Irish summit on the
peace process until the London and Dublin governments reached an accord.
He also told the Dublin parliament that talks with Mr Major on the peace bid
were now ``at a critical phase''.
Mr Bruton said: ``I would only wish to agree the setting of a date when I was
satisfied that we would be in a position to settle all the outstanding
matters.''
The Irish Premier's comments followed the overnight response issued by his
office to the set of proposals submitted to the Dublin government by Mr Major.
Earlier, Mr Bruton had reported ``considerable progress'' in the joint bid for
a breakthrough on their differences.
Mr Bruton said of his exchanges with Mr Major: ``Because the discussions are
now at a critical phase, I cannot elaborate at this stage. There have been
on-going discussions with attempts made on all sides to understand and
accommodate the views of others.''
However, he stressed ``the importance of maintaining momentum in the peace
process''.
Mr Bruton added: ``It is important that the British Prime Minister and I should
be able to work out any remaining difficulties as fully and as expeditiously as
possible.
``For that reason, I am not able to go into details.''
He rejected assertions that the current phase of the peace process was at an
end because of the long-running deadlock, declaring that assessment ``an
inaccurate view''.
Mr Bruton told the Dail: ``To my mind the peace process is being worked at very
sincerely and very actively by all of the parties involved.''
q A small explosion outside a courthouse yesterday which left a security guard
needing hospital treatment for shock was not terrorist-linked.
The blast was a ``crude object'', according to police. It is understood
gunpowder was used to trigger the blast as a police traffic cone was being
moved at the front of the building in Omagh, County Tyrone.
Police said the gunpowder and some coins were inside a grey box which caused a
flash when the cone was handled by the security man, who was taken to hospital
in Omagh.
Army bomb disposal experts were called in to examine the device but it is
understood police are satisfied it was not terrorist related.

<TEXT>
THE new Dumbarton and Clydebank Council may have to raise next year's council
tax by up to 40%.
According to the council's finance committee chairman, Mr George Cairney:
``Through no fault of our own, we could be starting out with a huge cash crisis
next year.''
The council joins the list of local authorities that face financial problems
when they take over in April under local government reorganisation.
Dumbarton and Clydebank needs more than #117m next year to maintain current
services. Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, however, maintains it is entitled
to just over #110m.
That leaves a shortfall that can be met only from council tax.
The mismatch arises because of the way the Scottish Office has chosen to
calculate councils' spending levels. It has simply divided up the present costs
of regional services per head of population.
Dumbarton and Clydebank's figures, however, are based on the actual amount
Strathclyde region spends in the area.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is asking Mr Forsyth to think
again and agree a mechanism for resolving the problem.
Councillor Cairney said: ``If Mr Forsyth does not agree to our request, we will
be in a very difficult position. I will be calling for all-party support for
Cosla's position.''

THE Prime Minister emerged yesterday in the new and hitherto unsuspected role
of ``headbanger.''
Public confession being all the rage this week, it may not have been so
surprising that he chose yesterday to speak out. Tomorrow - ``Helmut Kohl - my
unspoken love for Lady Thatcher''.
Mr Tim Rathbone, (Lewes - Con.) had asked Mr Major to ``bang a few heads
together'' in the Treasury where they were being bureaucratic about the Private
Finance Initiative.
Mr Major, clearly wanting to make it plain that he is no slouch at headbanging,
told him: ``I will certainly be happy to continue doing what you have said.''
``Heidbanger'' sang out Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley -
Lab.).
Mr Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West - Lab.) later suggested that Mr Major needed to
hire a team of psychiatrists for himself and the Cabinet.
This was to care for them after the next General Election required them to cope
with what President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang, had called ``just a state
of mind,'' i.e. unemployment.
Perhaps they should be called in earlier. For the true ``heidbanger,'' as the
Sketch understands it, is one who bangs his own heid either in ecstasy after or
during hearing some very loud heavy metal music, or in a kind of violent trance.
Prime Ministers are continually being confronted by events which must make them
want to bang other heads - the Treasury officials have presumably put in for
the special hazards allowance - and sometimes their own.
The opinion poll findings could well result in dents in the Downing Street
doors. ``Have you not put up taxes by the equivalent of 7p in the pound since
1992?'' demanded Mr Blair, happily aware that the answer was ``yes.''
Faced with a question like that, banging one's head on the conveniently
available despatch box might seem quite a natural option. But with millions
watching, such self-mutilation might repel as well as fascinate. One is not,
after all, a princess.
Gritting his teeth, Mr Major kept his head from banging and said taxes had been
put up during the recession to protect the vulnerable. Given time and a
non-partisan audience, he might have been able to explain his answer, which did
not, at the moment of delivery, sound quite right.
However, his concentration may have been wavering as he had already had another
headbanging temptation to resist. The boyish Liberal Democrat Matthew Taylor
had discovered that two Nigerian officials had been given visas to visit
Britain last weekend and were here. How did that square, he asked, with the
Prime Minister's denunciation of the Nigerian regime's execution of civil
rights campaigners?
If an MP asks the Prime Minister why a constituent has not received a council
house or an NHS wooden leg, the Premier may plausibly argue that there is no
reason for him to know that.
Mr Major had to confess that he knew nothing about these arrivals and could not
have liked doing so. Given his high-profile stand on Nigeria, the Nigerians
should probably not have been admitted but if there is a good reason for
letting them in, someone should have let the Prime Minister know it had
happened and what the reason was.
The Treasury bureaucrats can relax for a while. It is the heads of their chums
at the Home Office which could be in for a banging.

Trust offers
fast-track to
fundholders
A GLASGOW hospital may become one of the first in Scotland to introduce a
fast-track waiting list for patients referred by fund-holding GPs.
The Stobhill NHS Trust said the two-tier system for ophthal-mology patients
could result from measures it is taking after coming under pressure from local
fund-holders to reduce waiting times.
Patients can wait more than 15 months for an eye operation at Stobhill. A local
consortium of six fund-holding practices in Glasgow, Strathkelvin, and
Lanarkshire account for 80 of the 1250 procedures on NHS patients which
Stobhill is contracted to carry out this financial year.
Under pressure to reduce the delay to six months, Stobhill plans to spend
#250,000 hiring an additional eye consultant with nursing and other back-up
staff to increase the number of sessions available.
According to a report tabled at the trust's monthly meeting yesterday: ``GP
fundholders would be purchasing specific theatre sessions for their patients,
who would then be seen more quickly than other patients.
``The patients of GP fundholders would be removed from the current waiting
list, enabling other patients to be seen earlier than would otherwise be
possible.''
In this way, the trust hopes to retain the fundholders' business, which could
have cost it #100,000 in lost income. However, Dr Gary MacFarlane, a partner in
one of the practices, denied that they had agreed a two-tier system at the
hospital.
``We have been seeking a reduction in waiting times to something a bit more
reasonable, like six months, over the coming year,'' he said. ``We haven't put
a rigid timetable on it and we haven't demanded a fast-track for our patients
to go to the front of the queue.''
Greater Glasgow Health Board, which contracts for the bulk of Stobhill's
patients, will also be looking for a similar improvement for its patients.
Yesterday, the board offered a reprieve for both the in-patient opthalmology
and dermatology services at Stobhill, both of which were under threat as the
result of a planned rationalisation.
The trust will be given the opportunity in 1996-97 to deliver an improved and
more cost-effective in-patient and day-case opthalmology service and to develop
``imaginative'' proposals for improving dermatology services.
q THE 163-year-old Queensberry House Hospital in Edinburgh's Canongate, run as
a charity looking after the frail and infirm, is to close in March next year.
The cost of upgrading the building has become too much of a financial burden.
Its 125 residents, mostly women in their eighties, are to be consulted before
being moved to other nursing homes in the Edinburgh area.

THE huge availability of nearly 1400 new jobs in Northern Ireland was announced
yesterday, with 1000 more in the pipeline.
Montupet, a French car parts maker, said it planned to increase its workforce
at its west Belfast factory by 1360 over the next six years.
Officials at the Industrial Development Board prepared for a range of overseas
and local investments.
Around 4OO jobs are going to Portadown, County Armagh, and Dungannon, County
Tyrone, later this week and several hundred more will be announced for
elsewhere in the run-up to President Bill Clinton's visit to Belfast and
Londonderry next week.
The Montupet expansion, worth #142m, will be on the Dunmurry site of the
ill-fated De Lorean car factory site, where the company already makes cylinder
heads and alloy wheels.
It is the largest single investment since the start of the IRA ceasefire 14
months ago. The company has factories in France, Spain, and Canada.
IDB officials were jubilant. One said: ``It's been a desperate stuggle for
years because of the violence, but it's amazing the impact the ceasefires have
had.''

TORY disquiet over the Government's education plans was voiced yesterday when
the proposals for nursery education vouchers were angrily attacked by Labour as
the Commons debate on the proposals in the Queen's Speech continued.
Labour challenged Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard to join
it in working out a way to assure every four-year-old a nursery place without
the ``convoluted administrative nightmare'' of the proposed voucher scheme.
``I am calling your bluff,'' Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett told Mrs
Shephard in the Commons.
However, both Mrs Shephard and Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson
argued that Labour was ignorant of how the scheme would work, and made clear
they would be happy to debate the matter.
The Government is proposing that parents can buy vouchers worth #1100 and then
use them to send children to the place of their choice.
However, Mr Blunkett argued that only those parents already paying for nursery
education would gain, because they now would be subsidised by the vouchers.
Former Tory Education Minister George Walden joined in the criticism, warning
that Government plans would widen divisions between private and public
schooling. Mr Walden (Buckingham) suggested Ministers should adopt the Liberal
Democrats' pledge of promising nursery education to all three as well as four
year-olds, possibly funding the move through a tax on child benefit.
He said the Government's ``spatchcock'' plans for nursery education vouchers
risked entrenching the state/private split at the earliest age.
Mr Walden condemned the Assisted Places Scheme, which helps children from
lower-income families to attend private schools, saying it was a ``one-way
bridge'' between the state and private sector.
Another Tory, Mr Iain Mills (Meriden) criticised the nursery voucher scheme,
and claimed that local authorities already providing nursery education would
lose out under the plans.
Sir Malcolm Thornton, Tory chairman of the education select committee, also
wondered whether cash available to set up the scheme would have been better
spent on expansion of nursery provision.
Mr Robertson said last night: ``Pre-school vouchers put decision-making into
the hands of parents.
``Why does Labour fear voluntary choice? Why does Labour want to force parents
to send their children to a local authority nursery? Why does Labour seek to
exclude the private and voluntary sector? These are issues I look forward to
debating in the months ahead.''

ROSEMARY West faces three life sentences for murdering her Scottish-born
step-daughter, her own child, and a teenager made pregnant by Frederick West.
She now awaits the verdicts on seven further counts of murder. The jury was
unable to reach a decision on them yesterday and was sent for the night to a
hotel.
No matter what might happen today, her fate is already sealed.
Rosemary West, 41, showed little emotion as the first verdicts were delivered
in an electric atmosphere in Court No 3 at Winchester.
The seven men and four women first found her guilty of murdering Charmaine
West, eight, and seconds later guilty of killing her eldest daughter Heather,
16.
More than an hour later, in a still tense and hushed courtroom, the jury
delivered a third verdict, of murdering lodger Shirley Anne Robinson, 18, the
pregnant girlfriend of her late builder husband Frederick.
Later, Mrs West wept in her cell beneath the courtroom. She was downcast,
according to a member of her legal team.
Charmaine's aunt, Georgina, was in the public gallery as the first verdicts
were announced.
She let out a stifled squeal as Rosemary West was convicted of murdering her
niece. She then burst into tears. Nearby, in the public gallery, Anne Marie
Davis waited for the jury to return verdicts on her step-mother.
At first, she showed no emotion as the foreman delivered the unanimous
conclusion that Rosemary West had killed her sister and step-sister. Mrs Davis,
who had described how she herself was brutally and sexually abused by her
father and step-mother when only a child of eight, was later helped from the
public gallery by a witness support counsellor. By this time, she was sobbing.
The guilty verdict on Charmaine's murder also means the jury unanimously
believed Rosemary West killed alone.
At the time Charmaine died, the jury has been told, Frederick West was in
prison.
She was a little girl, born in Coatbridge, who showed an amazing degree of
courage and determination by refusing to cry when beaten by her step-mother,
the court heard. Her resolve not to give in may have cost her her life.
Charmaine's mother, Rena, was murdered by Fred West, her then husband before he
married Rosemary.
Throughout the trial, Rosemary West, dressed in black jacket and white blouse,
has shown little emotion.
Yesterday, her appearance and composure seemed much the same as the courtroom
waited on the verdicts.
Ms Angela Merridale, the clerk, after asking the defendant and jury foreman to
stand, proceeded to go through the 10 murder charges one by one.
Had they reached a verdict in respect of count one - that Rosemary West
murdered Charmaine West? ``Yes,'' the foreman replied.
``And what is your verdict?''
``Guilty.''
At that, Rosemary West took a slight but sharp intake of breath. From that
moment on, she stared ahead. She appeared stunned by the decision.
In response to the clerk's further questions, the foreman said the jury had not
reached verdicts on the next eight counts of murder.
However, on the 10th and last count, that of the murder of the West's first
daughter Heather, they had reached a verdict and that was ``guilty''.
The jury continued their deliberations and 90 minutes later returned to court
with their third verdict of guilty - that of killing Shirley Ann Robinson.
Charmaine disappeared in 1971. Her remains were found in the Wests' first flat
at 25 Midland Road, Gloucester.
She had killed Shirley Ann Robinson, who died, aged 18, while in the latter
stages of pregnancy with Fred West's child. She went missing in 1978. After her
disappearance, Rosemary West was seen clearing out Shirley's room and putting
her belongings into plastic bags for the dustmen.
She killed her own daughter Heather, who, when aged 16 in 1987, made no secret
of her intention to leave home. Her mother claimed she had been out shopping
and returned to find that her daughter had left home. The Crown has suggested
she could have died to prevent her blowing the whistle.
Both Shirley's and Heather's dismembered remains were unearthed from beneath
the rear garden patio at 25 Cromwell Street.
Having delivered the third verdict, the foreman told trial judge Mr Justice
Mantell that, even if given more time, it was unlikely they would be able to
deliver further verdicts last night.
Under police escort, they were driven by coach for a second night in a hotel.
Rosemary West was driven the short distance from court to Winchester Prison,
knowing her fate has been decided.
The trial continues today.

HOW many more girls died at the hands of Fred West? No one will ever know, as
he took that knowledge with him when he died in his prison cell.
The Gloucester builder himself claimed that there were 20 other victims about
whom he had not told police.
That claim, which came in the final evidence given at the trial of his widow,
fuelled speculation that the body count might be far higher than the 12
revealed by the inquiry sparked by the killings discovered at 25 Cromwell
Street.
There is still a finger of suspicion pointing to a plot of ground in Glasgow
once used by Fred West.
However, the only real possibility of a search by Strathclyde police at the
site of his allotment in Gower street, Kinning Park, would arise if Rosemary
West were to pass on the crucial information that her husband had boasted of
earlier killings in Glasgow.
At the moment the only strand the police here have is the doubt voiced by Mr
John McLachlan of Vallay Street, Milton - a man who provides a fascinating
insight to Fred West's character immediately prior to his return to
Gloucestershire.
In London, the National Missing Persons Helpline charity is now compiling
details of girls still missing from that period to help police follow-up
inquiries. But in the absence of hard evidence it is still likely that the
final official death toll will remain at 12.
During more than 108 hours of tape-recorded interviews with detectives West
admitted that he had killed 11 girls - but adamantly refused to admit that he
murdered his pregnant girlfriend Anne McFall.
The tapes - some of which were played to the jury - clearly showed him to be a
boastful liar who could not be relied on to tell the truth.
However, police are planning to renew their efforts to trace about 10 girls who
still cannot be accounted for.
The mammoth and painstaking police investigation at 25 Cromwell Street traced
around 200 young people who either stayed at, or visited, the house during two
decades.
Police are now believed to be ready to launch a fresh appeal for information on
the missing youngsters. They face a daunting task as in many cases they only
have nicknames and vague descriptions to work on.
Detectives have also never closed the file on missing Gloucester cafe waitress
Mary Bastholm - another girl Fred West claimed was one of his victims.
Fifteen-year-old Mary disappeared without trace from a Gloucester bus-stop
while on her way to see her boyfriend in January 1968.
Gloucestershire police have so far declined to comment on any inquiries carried
out by other police forces in connection with the Cromwell Street inquiry.
Only time, and fresh, hard evidence, will tell whether the fate of any more
youngsters can be laid at the door of the Gloucester killer.
John McLachlan is one of the few people left in Glasgow with knowledge of the
West case. He firmly believes that Fred's killing career did not begin in
England. He knew West well, tangled with him in violent physical confrontation
on a number of occasions, and was a lover of the murdered Rena Costello.
He vividly recalls first meeting her, a casual encounter at the house of a
friend in McLellan Street, Kinning Park, which left him asking later: ``Who was
that smasher?''
He can go back to the geographical locations, and to the actual people,
involved in the tortured train of events which led Rosemary West to the dock.
His breathing now laboured by a serious heart condition, John McLachlan walks
along McLellan Street where he lived in the early sixties and where he first
laid eyes on Rena Costello - who was by then Rena West, having married Fred
West in Ledbury in 1962 while pregnant with Charmaine.
The tenement where he lived, 94 McLellan Street, is gone, demolished to make
way for the motorway, as is the tenement where Rena lived with Fred West - the
end close in the street - and the bookie's shop next door where he first
chatted up Rena.
Charmaine's father was an Asian bus driver, and this liaison, which would raise
few eyebrows nowadays, led to Rena break with her family in Coatbridge and the
move to Glasgow.
Both Rena and later Charmaine were destined to become victims, Rena the victim
of Fred West at Much Marcle, the hapless child the victim of Fred and Rosemary
West at Cromwell Street. Charmaine was last seen alive aged eight in 1971.
John McLachlan first saw Rena during a casual call at the home of a neighbour.
Although a married man, he inquired who she was and was introduced. A few days
later he met her as he went into the bookmaker's shop next door to Rena and
Fred West's tenement and discovered there was a mutual attraction.
``It was obvious that even then Fred West was a violent man. Rena used to turn
up with black eyes or bruises on her body that would make any man sick. Every
time he gave Rena a doing like that I sought him out and gave him a doing. He
was four inches bigger than me but I could use my fists,'' said Mr McLachlan.
``I remember giving him a very sore face after he struck the little lassie,
Charmaine, for asking for a cone from his ice cream van. Any ordinary man would
have given the child some ice cream but instead he smashed her round the head
with his hand. I would not stand for that. It was obvious even than that he was
a violent and sadistic bastard who enjoyed beating up women and kids.''
As the airport traffic thunders past where the McLellan Street tenements once
stood, John McLachlan moves up a walkway alongside the concrete retaining walls
of the motorway. This leads to a bridge - the original bridge - over the
Paisley railway line and 200 yards on to Gover Street where Fred West had his
allotment. Many of the original houses are still there, much as they were in
the sixties, but the plots themselves are now occupied by good-quality, modern,
private housing.
John McLachlan goes unerringly to the house which occupies the site of much of
West's plot. A police officer who interviewed him early on in the inquiry
showed him pictures of four young girls who had disappeared when West was in
Glasgow. Mr McLachlan thought he recognised one of them and recalls that police
told him they might eventually search any parts of the allotments which had not
been built over using electronic equipment.
He said: ``We used to come up here every day. West had a piece of ground which
was always well dug but which he never put any plants in. I asked him several
times why he did not use that bit for potatoes and he always said he was
keeping it for `special purposes'.
``I told the police this and said to them they should check up on missing girls
from that period. I was told there were four, one of whose names - Margaret
McAvoy - I recognised.
``Fred West sometimes did not return from the allotment until the early hours
of the morning and I just wonder now what he was doing down there in the dark.
A lot of the ground is still there, now back gardens. Some of the original
trees are still there.
``I am not suggesting they disturb houses but I think the police should search
the ground which remains open.''
Strathclyde police have had only the flimsiest connection with the West case. A
senior detective told The Herald that they had been asked by an English force
to speak to a number of relatives - principally of Rena Costello and Anna
McFall - at the outset of the case almost two years ago. They had traced these
people and taken statements to establish when Rena was last seen in Scotland.
John McLachlan's experiences would have formed part of the evidence against
Fred West had he gone to trial. In the event, Rosemary West's defence team
toyed with the idea of using Mr McLachlan had the need arisen to discredit
further Fred's memory, but he was not called. His delicate medical condition,
the result of open heart surgery, may have played a part in that decision.
He remains convinced, though, that Fred West was just as evil when he lived in
Glasgow as he proved to be when he moved back to England - and that the police
could do worse than to have a hard, close look at what remains of the Gower
Street allotments in case the bones of young women lie there, 30 years on.
There has been at least one beneficial result from the black days of the West
investigation. More than 100 missing girls and young women have been put back
in touch with their relieved families in the aftermath of the Cromwell Street
investigation.
Police have revealed the key role of the National Missing Persons Helpline,
which aided the marathon task of identifying victims, some of whom were
murdered 20 years ago.
The London-based national charity used its computer database to compile a list
of 390 people whose ages, last known movements and dates of disappearance could
be significant.
In just two months, the charity was able to make contact with 110 missing girls
and pass on reassuring news to worried relatives.
It is now compiling details of girls who are still missing which could help
police follow-up inquiries following Rosemary West's trial.
In an average week Helpline volunteers deal with about 500 missing persons
calls, but such was the anxiety sparked by the Cromwell Street murders that
inquiries tripled between February and April last year.
Spokeswoman Sophie Woodford said: ``We offer an independent, totally
confidential point of contact, both for relatives and those who go missing for
any reason. But it is a vast problem and we could do much more work if we had
more funds.''
About 15% of those on the missing persons list are under 18 and there are three
times as many girls as boys.
The charity, founded in 1989 by former Detective Superintendent Nick Carter,
has 50 trained volunteers aided by a small full-time staff.
It also operates a Message Home - freephone 0500 700740 - for runaways who want
to reassure their families that they are safe.

James Freeman reports on Rena Costello's tragic journey from Bridgeton to a
grave in an English field
THE truth about Rena Costello's Glasgow days will never be fully known, but it
is very much a tale of the Glasgow of the late 50s and early 60s, a city
undergoing physical upheaval with communities breaking up as streets and
districts vanished to make way for new housing.
Against that background, some recall Rena as a wild young woman who enjoyed the
company of the kind of men who were only too willing to exploit her.
Others have a clear picture of a hard-working, caring young mother.
When suspicions were first raised that she was a victim of Fred West, The
Herald spoke to former neighbours who lived beside the young Catherine Costello
in Savoy Street, Bridgeton, Glasgow, who recalled her as ``a nice young woman
struggling to bring up two children''.
Mrs May Jackson said: ``She was only a young kid in her late teens but she was
exceptionally nice. She was very nice, a good neighbour and her kids were
always immaculate. We often remarked about that.''
There was never a hint of wild living. Mrs Jackson and her husband Archie both
said Rena was a good mother, whose kids clung to her because she was fond of
them.
Very much in keeping with the times, the Jacksons lost touch with Rena Costello
when they moved to a new home and Savoy Street fell to the bulldozers. Rena's
second child, Anna Marie, was born to West at the Savoy Street tenement.
John McLachlan, now of Milton, knew Rena as a bus conductress when he was a
driver. Her first child, the hapless Charmaine, was the daughter of an Asian
bus driver - which appears to have been the reason Rena left Coatbridge.
McLachlan was Rena West's lover at one stage. He says now that their affair,
conducted largely when West was out on his Mr Whippy rounds, ended unhappily.
Rena West pursued him to the point, he claims, where he had to ask the bus
depot foreman to make sure she was not rostered on his bus. He also talks of
wild drinking parties when Rena had a house in Arden Street, Maryhill.
One episode after Rena returned to West at Much Markle has become well-known
and that involved another of West's victims, Anna McFall.
The daughter of a motor mechanic, Thomas McFall of Malcolm Street, Glasgow, and
his wife Jeannie, a cleaner, she came into contact with West through her
friendship with Rena and her close friend, Isa McNeill.
Anna was a young girl going about with older women and when Rena and Isa went
south to West she went along.
John McLachlan received an anguished call from Rena some months on asking him
to come south urgently as West was getting violent again and beating her up.
The idea was that McLachlan should arrive in secret and whisk the women away,
but Anna McFall told Fred.
He reacted furiously and kept Charmaine and Anne Marie. Anna stayed put,
already pregnant by West, while Rena and Isa fled north with McLachlan. But
Rena returned to see her children, ending up in a field as did Anna McFall with
her unborn child.
Isa, who read the warning signs correctly, survived the episode and now lives
in Ayrshire.

HEATHER, who was 16 when she disappeared, was the first victim whose body was
found at 25 Cromwell Street but the last victim of the Wests' killing spree.
It was said at one court hearing that Fred West had told police he alone was
responsible for her murder - although that admission came before any other
bodies were discovered.
Heather, the first child of Fred and Rosemary West, was born before they were
married and when they lived at 25 Midland Road with Charmaine and Anne Marie.
Her former headmaster remembered her as a ``very pleasant'' girl.
Her parents never reported her missing, although they told various people that
they had. They also claimed she had run away from home, gone to Wales with a
lesbian, or was living happily locally, and said she often telephoned home.
Rosemary West also said she had given Heather #600, although she could not say
where she drew the money from. But Heather was dead - murdered, dismembered,
and buried under the garden patio.
SHIRLEY Anne lodged with the Wests and became pregnant by Fred. At times she
was to flaunt the pregnancy, but later she withdrew from the family circle, to
avoid an increasingly jealous Rosemary.
She was a classic victim for the Wests: from a broken home and vulnerable.
Shirley Anne was last seen at Gloucester Health Centre in May 1978, when she
was eight months pregnant.
Shortly afterwards, benefits office staff who tried to find her were told that
she had moved away from 25 Cromwell Street, leaving no forwarding address.
A week later, Rosemary West was seen in her old room, packing away her personal
possessions and clothes. The Wests later told people who inquired that Shirley
Anne had gone to Germany and given birth to a son she had named Barry.
Her body, with the foetus of her unborn child, was found buried in the garden
at the Wests' home. Her right leg had been chopped through, but she had not
been decapitated.
FRED West's first wife, Catherine, was Charmaine's mother, but Fred was only
her stepfather.
Charmaine was eight years old when she disappeared. By this time Fred West and
his future wife, Rosemary Letts, were living together. According to the
evidence, Rosemary greatly disliked Charmaine. When Fred was in jail, serving a
10-month sentence, she wrote to him saying the child needed to be handled
roughly.
Charmaine spent periods in care before going to live with Fred and Rosemary at
25 Midland Road, Gloucester. She disappeared in the spring of 1971. School
records showed that she had left, but gave no indication of where she had gone.
Rosemary West said Charmaine had been taken away by her mother Catherine ``and
bloody good riddance''. But her mother was already dead, murdered by Fred.
Charmaine's skeletal remains were found buried under the kitchen window at 25
Midland Road. Small pieces of coal were found with the bones, indicating that
her body was kept in the house's coal cellar before being buried.

How did a child from a strict disciplinarian background become a multiple
killer? James Freeman describes the path to destruction for a couple who could
have come straight from the pages of the FBI's crime manual
IN the annals of crime the sadistic multiple murderer is rare and couples such
as Fred and Rosemary West, murderers working in concert, are, within that small
group, even more unusual.
Fred doted on Rosemary, and she was heard to say she would stick with him, no
matter what, after all he had done for her.
But the marriage hid a depth of evil which few, even those experienced in
dealing with such matters, are able to understand.
Fred and Rosemary West were proud of what they often described as their open
marriage. Fred boasted that they drove the streets, travelling as far as London
or Bristol, in search of teenage girls they could lure into prostitution.
The couple met when Rosemary Letts, as she then was, was just 15 years old. A
rebellious teenager, she continued her relationship with Fred, who was then
married and already had two children, despite her family's opposition.
Her parents, desperate to break up what they saw as an extremely unsuitable
relationship, even put Rosemary into care. But as soon as she was out of care,
she went back to Fred, whom she first met when he was working as a baker's
roundsman. He often picked her up in his van.
Rosemary, who had three brothers and four sisters, was brought up by a strictly
disciplinarian father, and as a child was regularly taken to church.
She was also clearly taught the difference between right and wrong.
Her younger brother, Andrew Letts, now 43, recalls Rosemary's stubbornness.
``She was always trying to be grown up, but she was left out of things because
she was a little bit slow and backward,'' he said.
But when she met Fred, Rosemary seemed to have found the ideal partner.
Fred, who was 12 years older than Rosemary, and married and with two young
daughters, was a far from ideal match for an attractive young woman.
He was at times violent to his first wife - she left home on a number of
occasions because of it - and had already been in court for petty offences. He
had also been charged, although acquitted, of a sex offence involving a
13-year-old girl.
He was known as an easy-going man with a jokey nature, although his habit of
telling tall stories rapidly earned him the nickname Jackanory, after the
children television series.
At school, which he left at the age of 15, he had been troublesome, and as a
tousle-haired teenager was known for forcing his unwelcome attentions on girls
in an around his home village of Much Marcle.
Friends and neighbours said Fred and Rosemary seemed extremely close. They
talked freely of their sexual activity, and Rosemary never complained of abuse
from Fred, although she told police investigating the House of Horrors murders
that he had punched and choked her.
Mrs Elizabeth Agius, who lived in a flat at 25 Midland Road, Gloucester, told
the trial: ``They were a very close couple, really close. They were the type of
people who don't hide anything from one another.''
One lodger said Rosemary West had told her that she would never leave Fred
-``no matter what he did''.
Later, as he and Rosemary became more deeply embroiled in the bizarre sexual
activity which was to lead to murder and their eventual downfall, the link
between them seemed to strengthen.
In 35 years of practice the eminent American criminologist Robert Ressler,
associated for 16 years with the FBI's Behavioural Science Unit and from whose
academic writings the entire Silence of the Lambs genre sprang, can recall only
half a dozen of killing couples worldwide.
Fred West, according to Ressler who has been following the case from America,
may well have been killing long before the deaths revealed by the present
episode took place.
``Very often in examining the lives of such murderers I have discovered that
what has come to light is the tip of an iceberg and that there is much, much
more hidden away,'' he says.
There is also a strong possibility that Fred West may have been killing unknown
to Rosemary, in the period when they were together but before she had become
part of the murderous pact.
Robert Ressler points to one of the most notorious cases in America, that of
John Wayne Gacy, who lured at least 33 young men aged between 14 to mid 20s, to
their deaths.
During the final two and a half years of his marriage, in the period
immediately to his wife divorcing him, he was killing and burying bodies in the
basement of the family home unknown to his wife.
This idea, that Cromwell Street may not have been Fred West's first essay in
sadistic sexual murder, coming as it does from a source such as Robert Ressler,
lends credibility to the suspicions voiced by such as John McLachlan, the
Glasgow man who is one of the few people still around with direct experience of
Fred West's behaviour in the early 1960s before he moved back to the South-west
of England.
Couples such as the Wests are not becoming more common many criminologists,
including Ressler, believe. But our knowledge and interest in them is. Many
authorities see this as an unhealthy development, one Scottish forensic
psychologist pointing to the strengthening theory that what we are living
through is a manifestation of the disintegration of western society itself.
Ressler believes that society is becoming more and more attuned to bizarre
murders and that the entertainment media's obsession with the obscene is
playing a significant role, particularly in influencing the young.
The Wests could have jumped out of the pages of the celebrated Crime
Classification Manual which came from the FBI's 10-year project at    the
National Centre for the Analysis of Violent Crime       at Quantico, Virginia,
co-authored by Ressler.

THE gap-toothed smile of little Charmaine West shone across the court room at
Rosemary West's trial, to be replaced by a grim picture of her skull.
It was one of the most harrowing moments of the trial as forensic dental expert
Dr David Whittaker used a large screen to demonstrate his technique of facial
superimposition.
It was a key piece of evidence which was to pinpoint to within a few weeks the
time of Charmaine's murder in 1971.
First Dr Whittaker showed eight-year-old Charmaine's smiling portrait, then he
flashed up the picture of her skull.
Superimposing the portrait on the photograph of the skull, he was able to match
the dental features exactly and prove that the body found at the former West
family home was Charmaine.
Dr Whittaker, one of the country's foremost experts in the science and art of
forensic dentistry, with more than 30 years' experience in the field, found
himself with the task of identifying the bodies found in Cromwell Street and
Midland Road, Gloucester, and at the hamlet of Kempley, because their teeth
still held vital clues.
``Teeth give far more information about a person than any other part of the
body,'' said Dr Whittaker, a consultant dental surgeon and reader in oral
biology at the University of Wales College of Medicine in Cardiff.
``Age, childhood diseases, even sometimes which drugs were prescribed, all are
recorded in your teeth.''
But dental records were not available in every case.
So the team led by Dr Whittaker turned to another technique - ``facial
superimposition''.
A computerised system links electronic video and stills cameras, so that the
characteristics of a skull can be superimposed on a photograph of a suspected
victim.
Precise measurements are then taken to compare more than a dozen crucial
points, down to the smallest detail.

A POLICEMAN was sentenced to three months in jail yesterday for indecently
assaulting a woman at her flat.
Constable Ian Gibson, 31, was told by a sheriff that his actions were an
``abuse'' of his position as a police officer.
The court had heard earlier he subjected Miss Karen McNally, 35, a mother of
two, to a frightening ordeal during a late night visit to her home.
Miss McNally had claimed Gibson had offered to drop a minor drug charge in
exchange for sex.
Outside the court yesterday, she said: ``I'm delighted. He got what he deserved.
``I went through a terrifying ordeal at the hands of this man. I'm glad I
carried it through, I never want this happening to anyone else.''
She added: ``I hope this shows the police that they are not above the law.''
Gibson was freed on bail yesterday pending an appeal against both conviction
and sentence.
During the late-night visit to Miss McNally's flat, Gibson asked her if she
indulged in oral sex and made suggestions to her about handcuffs.
The constable touched her and tried to kiss her.
Gibson, of Fontstane Street, Monifieth, offered her money, grabbed her wrists,
and struggled with her during his 90-minute visit. The court heard he asked her
``to put up a bit of a fight'' and when she rejected his advances Gibson told
her ``it's your loss''.
During Gibson's trial last month, Miss McNally told Dundee Sheriff Court that
he had turned up drunk at her flat at Quarryfield Court, Dundee, late at night
on November 15 last year.
Four days earlier, the officer had been part of a police drugs raid that seized
a small piece of cannabis at her home.
She said Gibson had returned alone and asked her if they could ``come to some
arrangement'' over the drug and he implied that he would drop the charges
against her in return for sex.
Yesterday, as Gibson was sentenced at Dundee Sheriff Court, Sheriff Alexander
Eccles told him: ``The actions carried out by you were at the least
extraordinary and clearly an abuse of your position as a constable.''
Sheriff Eccles said Gibson had not only brought himself ``but indirectly the
police service into disrepute''.
The sheriff added: ``I take the view that in the light of the very serious
nature of the offence, given your position, the only realistic disposal is a
custodial one.''
Before Gibson was sentenced to the three months, defence solicitor Len Murray
said the policeman's career was ``unblemished'' and asked the sheriff not to
take an ``extreme'' view when dealing with his client.
Mr Murray admitted: ``This matter has in many ways destroyed him. It has
certainly destroyed his career.''
Gibson was cleared by Sheriff Eccles after trial of a charge alleging that on
November 10 last year, he attempted to induce a Justice of the Peace to grant
him a search warrant and attempted to defeat the ends of justice.
Mr Stewart Ross, information officer for Tayside Police, said last night:
``Constable Gibson is under suspension.
``No further action will be taken until the due legal process has been
completed.''

Sarajevo, Tuesday
US and European leaders, their lives blighted by the war in former Yugoslavia
for the last four years, poured out their relief and joy at the peace deal
struck in the United States today.
However in Sarajevo, the battered city that became the symbol of Europe's worst
conflict since the Second World War, people greeted the news of peace with
suspicion and recalled countless past agreements which have failed.
Government television and local radio station carried CNN live as President
Clinton announced the agreement at the White House in Washington.
Scattered small arms fire erupted in the hills around the city in celebration
and patrons in some cafes in the Bosnian capital topped up their glasses to
drink a toast.
However residents in a city which has suffered 10,500 dead and 50,000 wounded
spoke sceptically of paper promises, recalling countless past agreements among
Bosnia's warring parties which failed to prevent lapses back into war.
``I'm not celebrating no matter what's signed; I'm waiting until peace really
comes,'' said 55-year-old former electrician, Nezir Skoro.
Both his sons fought as government soldiers during the siege of the city. One
is now 40% disabled and the other has been wounded three times.
However the misery and loss of war has only hardened his desire for a peace
worthy of its name.
``Bosnia must be free. We must have a normal life.......We'll see, but none of
us is very hopeful given what we've heard.''
For US President Bill Clinton, the deal struck at an air force base in Ohio
after three weeks of talks marked a personal triumph of Washington's leadership.
``The people of Bosnia finally have a chance to turn from the horror of war to
the promise of peace.......The presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia have
made a historic and heroic choice,'' he said.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, in a televised address from Ohio, said:
``The war is finally over in Bosnia-Herzegovina.''
He said the time had come for economic recovery and co-operation, and noted
that the pact meant crippling UN sanctions against rump Yugoslavia would be
suspended immediately.
Milosevic, widely blamed for igniting the conflict in former Yugoslavia four
years ago, said the US negotiations had given the Serbs a fair share of
territory and were a marked improvement on the previous peace plan drawn up by
the five-nation Contact Group.
Russia, often at odds with Washington and its European partners in the divisive
squabbling that has marked the search for peace, hailed the agreement and also
urged the United Nations to lift sanctions promptly.
``A big step was made towards a comprehensive settlement of the most tragic
conflict in Europe since the Second World War,'' said Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the United Nations would do all
it could to help end the suffering and restore life to normal.
``The accords announced in Dayton give us hope that peace can now become a
reality in the war-torn lands of the former Yugoslavia,'' he said.
``The world should, at this time, pay tribute to all those peacekeepers of the
United Nations, both military and civilian, who at great personal cost helped
contain and stabilise the situation until the warring parties could turn from
war to peace.''
The United Nations had more than 40,000 peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia
at the height of its operations there. The numbers have been reduced in recent
months.
France hailed the accord, saying it included a commitment to return two French
pilots missing since they were shot down by the Bosnian Serbs in August.
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette told Parliament that a final agreement
between Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia would be signed formally at a conference in
Paris soon, probably early next month.
However de Charette also warned that peace had not yet been achieved in
practice. ``The peace accord is fragile. The parties must therefore act in good
faith from today to implement it in its entirety,'' he said.
That sentiment was echoed by European mediator Carl Bildt, present at the
marathon three-week peace talks. ``Important as it is, it represents but the
beginning of peace. We must all be deeply aware of the challlenges and
difficulties in the days, weeks, months, and years ahead,'' he said.
Nato, which is preparing to take over from the United Nations as leader of a
60,000-strong force to implement a peace deal, said it was ready to go ahead.
Troops could be in place less than 100 hours after the Paris signing ceremony.
Britain and Germany - countries which have joined the United States, Russia,
and France in trying to broker peace through the Contact Group - hailed the
accord.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the peace deal was ``a decisive step towards
the restoration of peace in.......former Yugoslavia''.
The European Commission in Brussels said it was ready to organise a pledging
conference to help pay for the war-torn region's reconstruction, expected to
cost billions of pounds.
``The Commission and the World Bank are now in contact to organise a pledging
conference for all potential donor countries which should take place as soon as
possible,'' said an EU statement.
Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN peace mediator for former Yugoslavia, hailed the
Dayton accord as a ``formidable achievement''.
``We can now open a new chapter. In order to live up to the goals of peace,
respect for human rights, and normalisation of the relations between the
peoples of the region, much will be required,'' he said.
The world body's UNHCR refugee agency, while also welcoming the agreement,
urged European governments hosting some 700,000 refugees from Bosnia to
``exercise some patience'' and not to attempt to send them home in the
immediate future.
``We want to carry out any repatriation in a phased and organised manner, which
would begin inside Bosnia itself,'' said spokesman Ron Redmond.
The UNHCR, the leading international humanitarian agency in the former
Yugoslavia, wanted to begin a return home with the 1.3 million people
internally displaced in Bosnia.-Reuter.

Making itself youthful: John Davidson, with boyish enthusiasm, nails fashion's
colours to the past
BOYS will be boys. And given half a chance, lads will be likely. Which is why
even the best of friends and closest of brothers find themselves in the sort of
scrap which invariably ends in a black eye.
Meet Tweedledum and Tweedledee, larking about in this season's wardrobe of
menswear.
Whatever has happened to men's clothes lately? Well . . . jackets still have
two sleeves - and trousers, two legs. But what is both bold and new is the
reappearance of colour. Designers have surely been inspired by greengrocery to
introduce a rich new palette: greengage, tangerine, and Granny Smith green from
the fruit section - a host of gourd-like yellows and pepper reds from the
vegetable counter.
Many men would never dare be seen in cords more colourful than deepest mud. But
the fact is this: more men than at any point in history since the Regency now
have an appetite for cutting-edge fashion. They follow trends. They covet
designer labels. And most significantly of all, they shop for themselves. The
man who relies on mother, wife or girlfriend to supply his sartorial needs is
an endangered species.
Menswear designers (and style-sensitive middle or mass market manufacturers)
have become emboldened. They know that there is a customer demanding clothes of
distinctive design, echoing the style of his music or sporting heroes.
Imagine a meltdown of all the strongest style statements which characterise the
British pop music scene - from Blur's Damon (with his neo-nerd spin on the
trainspotter look) to the foppish rakishness of Pulp's Jarvis Cocker.
Add in a generous measure of the country gentleman look (which never really
escapes from any menswear style manual) and tip the mixture into a giant
Magimix-like style-processor. Result? This season's colourful, menswear - part
lad, part laird.
Elementally, for men who strive to remain boyish, the slipover is the thing.
And back into prominence it has indeed slipped, vying for attention with the
dandy-like elegance of a fine silk waistcoat. In a reminder that yesterday's
fashion disaster can so easily become today's style essential, this season's
version is every bit as bright and tight as any undersized triumph of handcraft
ever knitted by Auntie Doris for her favourite nephews.

JAGUAR Cars was systematically cheated out of hundreds of thousands of pounds
in a four-year conspiracy involving two of its own publicity managers, a court
was told yesterday.
``Trusted'' managers Roger Fielding, 43, and Ronald Parker, 61, took vast
bribes from Reynard Platt, 51, in return for fraudulent contracts, said Mr
David Bate QC, prosecuting at Snaresbrook Crown Court, central London.
Fielding, until recently an Edinburgh resident, Parker, and Platt have admitted
conspiracy to commit corruption. A fourth defendant, Mr Roger Kennedy, 51, is
alone in the dock denying conspiracy to defraud Jaguar.
Mr Bate said Jaguar first had to be defrauded to provide the ``engine and the
driving force for the bribes''.
Mr Kennedy and his West London-based firm, Nova Arts Ltd, are accused of acting
as a money-launderer for Platt, who was the company director of the Facilites
Group, a subsidiary of advertising giant Saatchi and Saatchi.
Platt also headed Number 32, which carried out all typesetting and translation
work for Jaguar.
Mr Bate told jurors that for four years, between 1987 and 1991, ``two of their
trusted senior employees were systematically defrauding Jaguar on a large
scale''.
He said Fielding and Parker ensured that contracts for the translation of
Jaguar publications went to Platt and Mr Kennedy and others, and used false
invoices to overcharge the car firm massively.
Mr Bate said that once Jaguar paid up, large sums of money were then paid by
way of bribes to Fielding and Parker and then the whole system would be
repeated.
The prosecution claims Mr Kennedy would create false bills for non-existant
work and the money paid to the Nova account would then be siphoned off by Platt
for more bribes and to maintain a lifestyle that included horse-owning.
``Kennedy was providing clean money. He was providing money that could not be
directly related to Jaguar and what was going on,'' Mr Bate said.
Mr Bate said the scheme was ``pretty enormous'', explaining that he could not
put a precise figure on it.
He said that during the four years in which the system operated, Fielding
received #334,777, most of it in bribes, in addition to his Jaguar salary of
#105,215.
Mr Kennedy, of Edenbridge, Kent, denies conspiracy to defraud Jaguar and a
further charge of conspiracy to commit false accounting.
Fielding, of Evesham, Worcestershire, and Parker, of Coventry, have admitted
conspiracy to commit corruption.
Fielding originally gave his address as Spottiswood Street, Edinburgh, from
where he moved to Bideford-on-Avon, Warwickshire.
Platt, of South Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, admits conspiracy to commit
corruption.
Williams, of Teddington, South London, admits conspiracy to defraud Jaguar and
conspiracy to commit corruption.
Mr Kennedy's trial continues and is expected to last up to two weeks, after
which the other defendants will be sentenced.
The trial continues today.

A SHERIFF gave a benefits cheat a second chance yesterday after hearing his
ambition was to join the police force.
Student Gary Brogan, 20, of Lilac Avenue, Clydebank, admitted he fraudulently
claimed almost #400 of unemployment benefit and failed to tell DSS officials
that he was working part-time as a barman.
Dumbarton Sheriff Tom Scott granted Brogan an absolute discharge after hearing
that he wanted to join the police force after finishing a sports science course
at Glasgow Caledonian University.
Defence solicitor Graeme Yeoman said Brogan would have no chance of being
accepted with a conviction for dishonesty on his record.
Brogan produced #397.65 in court as repayment to the DSS and was told by the
sheriff: ``You have already done what I would have ordered you to do.''
Sheriff Scott added: ``You are very lucky. This court very, very seldom grants
an absolute discharge.''

CHANNEL 4 chiefs celebrated yesterday after scooping top awards in three out of
six categories at the International Emmy awards.
The station, criticised in some quarters for indecency and low standards in
programming, was the undisputed victor at the New York ceremony.
BBC TV was also a winner in two categories and director general John Birt was
awarded the Directorate Emmy for outstanding contributions to international
television, making British television the star of the evening.
The awards are made by the US Academy of Arts and Sciences to programmes made
outside the United States.
BBC TV and Channel 4 shared the honours in the children and young people
category with Little Lord Fauntleroy and Wise Up respectively.
The best documentary prize was won jointly by a French holocaust film and the
BBC co-production Anne Frank Remembered.
For Channel 4, the hard-hitting series The Politician's Wife won best drama
award and Chris Evans's Don't Forget Your Toothbrush took the prize for best
popular arts.
There has been recent speculation that Chris Evans might take Don't Forget Your
Toothbrush to the BBC, however, Channel 4 chiefs own the British rights to the
format.

New Delhi, Tuesday
SOME 22 people were injured, one seriously, when a bomb planted in a cooking
oil container exploded tonight outside a popular restaurant in the heart of the
Indian capital.
The previously unknown Jammu and Kashmir Islamic Front claimed responsibility
for the blast in the central Connaught Place shopping area.
Witnesses said the bomb was hidden in a tin used to store clarified butter, or
ghee.
``I saw fire coming out of the ground and thought it was fireworks,'' said
Dutch tourist Christian Van Doorn, who suffered minor injuries.
In the troubled Jammu and Kashmir state, officials signalled hope for the
release of four Western hostages, including two Britons. The officials had
their longest contact yet in ``cordial'' talks with the kidnappers from the
shadowy Al-Faran guerrilla group.-Reuter.

Leading ladies have a short shelf life in Hollywood. There's always someone
ready to oust even the newest star, as Douglas Thomson discovers
ALICIA Silverstone is 18 years old, attractive and talented and commands
multi-million dollar fees which make those handed out to National Lottery
blonde presenters seem like small change. Silverstone is a Hollywood star.
Well, she is and she isn't. What she really reflects is that strange
combination of the whimsy of silver screen audiences and the crass practicality
of those in their Armani-scented offices who run the show.
She is the flavour of the moment.
With Hollywood actresses you can't put it much longer than that. Videos of
their work often have a longer shelf life.
Last month Silverstone, the daughter of a Scottish-born one-time Pan-Am air
stewardess, was a Tinseltown toast having won a $10m two-film package from
Columbia Studios. This was on the back of the recent cinema release, Clueless,
in which she plays a not-too-far-from-the-truth Beverly Hills teenager whose
mother died from too much liposuction - a dreadful demise for which she
compensates by shopping. Endlessly.
Directed by Amy Fast Times At Ridgemont High Heckerling, this satire - to the
knowing, sometimes a documentary - on Beverly Hills teenage girls is fast, dark
and clever and a tremendous ``star'' vehicle for the leading lady.
This past week the British critics joined in the praise of the young actress.
She was ``a young Meg Ryan'' and had a ``clever way with acting which might
have been the envy of Goldie Hawn''. Our star of the moment was, you might
believe from all the reviews, a replacement, a clone, of what had gone before.
Very quickly.
Well, Meg Ryan is 33 and Sleepless In Seattle was two or was it three years
ago? Anyway, her latest film just out here, French Kiss with Kevin Kline, is
something of a clunker albeit Royal Premiere material.
And Goldie Who? The Laugh-In, wasn't it? Goldie Hawn, of course, moved on to
make a string of films some of which were memorable. Then she began producing
her own material.
But once upon a time she was glancing over her shoulder at actresses like
Michelle Pfeiffer who in turn was feeling the pressure from Meg Ryan who .....
Julia Roberts remains a big star but she's been overtaken by Sandra Bullock who
roared off with Speed, set the pace with While You Were Sleeping and at present
has another hit with the thriller The Net. Julia Roberts faltered with the film
adaptation of author John Grisham's The Pelican Brief.
And it is Sandra Bullock who is at present filming Grisham's A Time To Kill and
has a string of offers worth more than $6m a time.
It was reported that Roberts won a role in the next Batman project over Demi
Moore but if it ever happens for her it will be because Moore was not
interested. Now the highest paid actress in the world Moore, aka Mrs Bruce
Willis, is the $12m woman and is at present filming Striptease in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida.
Demi Moore, following Indecent Proposal and Disclosure, is the Hollywood sex
queen. Sharon Stone had that title a couple of years ago. She wants it back.
``If I have to diet, I'm gonna diet. If I have to work out, I'm gonna work out.
If I have to sleep upside down like a bat so I don't look like a basset hound,
that's what I'm gonna do. Because I'm not leaving.''
Stone means centre stage. At 37, she's entering the danger zone for women in
movies. She was a producer of her present film, The Quick and the Dead, and
she's been told that is the way to go. Her adviser was Faye Dunaway from Bonnie
and Clyde to Columbo who, she says, told her: ``Get in development now. It's
the time of the producer-actress. Get seven things going - get 10! You've got
the power now. Get your own work and create longevity for yourself.''
But how do you define actresses' longevity in Hollywood? When Michelle Pfeiffer
was making Russia House with Sean Connery she was a little more than half his
age. She asked: ``When I'm 60 years old are they going to let me do Russia
House? With a 32-year-old leading man? I don't think so. I'm very aware that
this is my window of time. I want to be allowed to age gracefully but they
don't let you do that in this business......''
So how long has Alicia Silverstone got? The other day Jodie Foster was tagged
``the most powerful woman in Hollywood'', but with all the Oscars and the
acclaim is that so this week, as far as audiences are concerned?
Where was Meryl Streep until The Bridges of Madison County resurrected her? Kim
Basinger is pregnant. Geena Davis is divorced and remarried. Goldie Hawn lives
in Colorado, and Jane Fonda in Atlanta with media mogul Ted Turner.
They were all, in a way, once Alicia Silverstone.
Fame changes as fast as fashion as all around try to cash in on the new line.
The century began with the Lillians (Russell and Langtry) and moved on in 1910
to another Lillian (Gish) before the clock brought on Clara Bow, then Greta
Garbo and Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford, Betty Grable and Rita Hayward; by 1950
Bardot and Grace Kelly and Sophia Loren and Ava Gardner were to dominate the
next decade. The sixties had Raquel Welch and Ursula Andress, the seventies
Farrah Fawcett, while it was all about Madonna and Brooke Shields in the
eighties.
For now we have Demi Moore and Julia Roberts and Cindy Crawford - and Alicia
Silverstone. Columbia's Mark Canton is not apologising for buying up this
moment's teenage sensation: ``We do not do business here by throwing things
against the wall. Silverstone will star in Excess Baggage which will cost in
the $16m range to make. Clueless is going to do millions of dollars in
business. If I can make the next Alicia Silverstone movie for $16m I'm doing my
business.'' Nevertheless, the deal has amazed others. Silverstone has earned
strong reviews. Which is fine. But she is now among the highest-paid actresses
in today's Hollywood. Part of her package also included the creation of her own
film production company, First Kiss. Columbia strongly defend their agreement
and especially executive Barry Josephson who was in charge of it. ``We saw she
had great comedic talent. Everyone here was highly impressed with what she did
and we think she has a great future.
``She has a young audience and obviously it's a great audience because they go
to a lot of movies.''
There, of course, is the clue. The youth market is the core of the film
industry today. No studio wants to lose out on a potential teenage superstar.
However, they don't stay teenagers forever. Elaine Goldsmith, who is the agent
to Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon, sees nothing wrong with the idea.
``Sometimes it is what the economy dictates and she may just be the right age
and the right look and talent at the right time.''
But, again, for how long?
We got a hint last week. Alicia Silverstone's film The Babysitter - it was made
before Clueless - was released by Republic Pictures Home Video. It never made
it to American cinemas. Video store owners are delighted. Silverstone's
Clueless success means they are buying in many more copies than usual of The
Babysitter, which focuses on one evening and a group of teenagers' often
lustful fantasies.
``A lot of 17-year-old boys are going to want this,'' said buyer Karen
Peterson, who works for one of America's biggest video store chains. She is
taking her piece of the present Alicia-mania.

A GLASWEGIAN - nicknamed the Beast - who admitted shooting his sister-in-law
dead with a sawn-off shotgun, was jailed for six years at the Old Bailey
yesterday.
John Quinn, 38, had turned up at Adeline Kelly's home armed with the gun and a
bayonet during a feud with her partner, Mr Peter Farrell.
Ms Kelly had taunted him, shouting: ``Come on, shoot, big man'', prosecutor
Orlando Pownall told the court. Quinn had told the 33-year-old not to push him
and had then fired.
She died soon afterwards from her injuries on the balcony of her Fulham home.
Quinn as cleared yesterday of murder but was found guilty of manslaughter in
April.

THE Crown Office has rejected criticism from an Aberdeen legal firm of the
prosecution of a case in which two women were found not guilty of embezzling
#572,000 after the sheriff held that banking records crucial to the case could
not be proved under recent legislation.
Responding to criticism by the firm of Storie, Cruden, and Simpson of the
prosecution of the women at Aberdeen Sheriff Court, the Crown Office yesterday
strongly denied it had committed a legal blunder and claimed the case was
prepared carefully on the basis of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings
(Scotland) Act 1993.
It also said it was firmly of the view that its provisions were ``competent and
appropriate'' for the proof of banking records.
Mrs Eleanor Masson, 62, of Burnieboozle Crescent, Aberdeen, and Mrs Doreen
Cruickshank, 55, of Gordon Court, Newmachar, had denied embezzlement which was
alleged to have occurred between January 1982 and February 1991.
Storie, Cruden, and Simpson - for whom the women worked and from whom the money
was allegedly taken - criticised the Crown Office when the case ended before
any key evidence could be heard because, in the view of Sheriff Kenneth Forbes,
the Crown had failed to have bank statements crucial to the case certified
under the appropriate Act.
The legal firm said on Monday that its partners were ``appalled by the manner
in which the Crown Office has seen fit to prosecute the case which has
singularly failed to serve the ends of justice.''
However, a Crown Office spokesman said yesterday: ``This case was carefully
prepared on the basis of the business evidence provisions contained in the
Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 which were designed to
deal with difficulties in relation to proof of documentary evidence which had
been identified by the High Court, the banking industry, and the Scottish Law
Commission.
The spokesman added: ``The Scottish Law Commission carried out a comprehensive
review of the law on documentary evidence and made recommendations to the Lord
Advocate for legislative change, leading to the enactment of the provisions of
the 1993 Act.
``It is the current practice of the Crown to make use of the 1993 Act
provisions wherever possible and there is no question of a Crown `blunder' in
using the 1993 Act to prove bank records in the present case.
``The Crown Office remains firmly of the view that the provisions of the 1993
Act are competent and appropriate for the proof of banking records and is
considering what options are available to bring the matter before the Criminal
Appeal Court.''

NURSES at Scottish hospitals are to be protected by dog patrols from possible
attacks.
German shepherds and their handlers will patrol hospital grounds at night to
maintain the safety of nurses and other hospital workers.
The initiative has been launched at six hospitals in Dundee, where the patrols
will act as a deterrent against attacks.
All five patrol animals from Tayside Police dog section will be involved in the
operation.
They will walk the grounds at Dundee Royal Infirmary, Ninewells, Kings Cross,
Ashludie, Strathmartine, and Royal Victoria hospitals.
Although no nurses have been attacked in the grounds of the hospitals,
management have agreed to the initiative in a bid to lessen the fear of crime.
Mrs Catherine Bissett, site manager at three of the hospitals, said: ``I think
this is great, we have needed it for a long time.
``Nurses had expressed fears about walking to their cars when they had finished
their shifts late at night.
``At Ashludie, we often have drunken yobs in the ground who vandalise
buildings. Nurses undoubtedly feel safer when they know there will be a dog
patrol in the grounds.
``There's only so much that police in patrol cars can do. This definitely gives
added security.''
The hospitals were approached by Tayside Police for the operation.
Sergeant Ron Fyffe, head of the force's dog section, said: ``We decided it
would be a good idea to bring in high-profile dog patrols at the hospitals.
``We do stress that there is not any particular incidence of crime at
hospitals. But people working in them can be particularly vulnerable and the
hospitals themselves can often be large dark buildings with large grounds.
``The force is always looking for ways of making the public feel more secure.''
The dog patrols will continue indefinitely.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry told road washed away in torrent. Driver within feet of bridge did not see it had collapsed</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>13</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975257725</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DEADLY cracks appeared on a bridge before two young men died when it collapsed
into a rain-swollen river.
One HGV driver, Mr David Hopkins, 34, said he had crossed the bridge in a Land
Rover and noticed that its surface was being washed away.
He said the layer of asphalt had been separated from the tarmacadam because of
torrential rain.
Mr Hopkins said that after crossing the bridge he picked up his brother-in-law,
off-duty policeman Ian McGuinness, and again approached the bridge at Gavell
Road, Twechar, near Kilsyth.
He told a fatal accident inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court that they stopped at
the bridge and cracks had appeared across it. ``The road had dropped maybe an
inch.''
Two fire appliances arrived to help another driver stranded in the flooded road
and Mr Hopkins said he told the firefighters about the cracks.
He claimed one of them said he would contact his control and that they would
deal with the problem.
Mr Hopkins, of Melrose Gardens, Twechar, said he and his brother-in-law decided
not to cross the bridge and took a detour to Twechar.
Later, they were told of the tragedy.
He was giving evidence at the inquiry into the deaths of John Furay, 17, of The
Strone, St John's Way, and James McClement, l7, of Kelvin Way, both Twechar.
They drowned when the VW Polo being driven by Mr Furay fell from the collapsed
bridge into the River Kelvin on December 11, 1994. Their bodies were recovered
two days later.
A third person, Mr James Gibson, l8, of Differ Avenue, Twechar, escaped when he
kicked open the car door and jumped into the river.
He managed to reach safety and raised the alarm.
Mr Hopkins told the inquiry that he was a driver and delivered and laid asphalt
on roads.
He said that after getting back to Twechar that Sunday afternoon, he and Mr
McGuinness were in a social club in the local masonic hall when Mr Gibson came
in to tell them of the accident.
Mr Hopkins said this was about 4.20pm and immediately he ran to his Land Rover,
followed by Mr McGuinness and three others.
He told Mrs Margaret Porter, leading the evidence, that he drove towards the
bridge but it was dark. The others jumped out of the Land Rover and walked
ahead of him.
He was unaware that the bridge had collapsed until one of his friends walking
in front saw the danger and warned him to stop.
He told Mrs Porter: ``This was two feet from the edge of the broken bridge.''
He said there was no warning on the road and no sign of the emergency services.
People said voices had been heard coming from the river so he shone his
headlights up the river while others walked along the banks following the
current.
He tried to get stronger lights but failed and a rope was tied across the
bridge to prevent people going over.
Mr Hopkins said he also blocked the approach to the bridge with his Land Rover.
Questioned by Mrs Porter, he said it was not until 30 to 45 minutes after he
reached the scene that police arrived, followed by workers from the road
department.
He told the road workers: ``You have taken your bloody time to get here.'' One
of them replied: ``I have only just been told.''
Mr Hopkins said that when he spoke to the firefighters at the bridge earlier,
it would have been about 2.45pm and he thought they were taking care of the
matter. Questioned by Mr Colin Sutherland QC, for Strathclyde Police, Mr
Hopkins said that when he approached the bridge after the tragedy he would have
gone into the river if one of his friends walking in front had not stopped him.
``I would not have seen it,'' he said.
Mr McGuinness, 28, said he was off duty and could not get home in his car.
It was arranged that Mr Hopkins would pick him up in his Land Rover and on the
return journey they stopped to look at the cracks on the bridge.
Mr McGuinness said he thought the fire officers they had spoken to would have
taken care of the matter.
The policeman said there were no warnings signs at the approach to the
collapsed bridge and he and Mr Hopkins tied a rope across it.
He then went along the river bank but could not see any sign of the car.
Mr McClement, father of one of the dead boys, and another son arrived. They
were very upset. The son wanted to jump into the water but he managed to calm
him.
Mr James McCulloch, 49, principal engineer with Strathclyde Regional Council,
said he went to inspect the bridge on December 12, the day after the tragedy.
His preliminary opinion was that because of the exceptional rain the river flow
had increased to 37 to 47 cubic metres of water a second when it was normally
in single figures.
The force of the water hitting the north bank of the river sent it to the south
side causing turbulence which scoured a hole in the bed of the river.
Mr McCulloch said the support of the bridge, built in l927, would have fallen
into the hole, causing the collapse.
The inquiry, before Sheriff Bruce Kerr, continues.

Dissident leader
held in China
BEIJING: China has formally arrested Wei Jingsheng, its most prominent
dissident and father of its embattled democracy movement, on the capital charge
of trying to overthrow the government.
Wei, 46, a veteran of China's prisons and a nominee for    this year's Nobel
Peace Prize, was charged after police reportedly found evidence that he was
involved in activities aimed at toppling the communist state.
Smile, please
AREZZO: Two Italians believe they have solved one of the mysteries of the Mona
Lisa - the landscape Leonardo da Vinci painted in the background of the
portrait. After four years researching their theory, the pair say it is the
countryside around the village of Ponte a Buriano, on the River Arno near the
Tuscan city of Arezzo. No-one, however, has yet explained the mystery of the
Mona Lisa's smile.

weeks of public dispute over who should take the job.
Nazi jailed
ROME: Former Nazi SS captain Erich Priebke was flown to Italy from Argentina
yesterday and placed in solitary confinement to await trial over the country's
worst Second World War atrocity. Priebke, 82, has admitted a role in the

Quebec move
MONTREAL: Separatist leader Lucien Bouchard ended weeks of speculation by
announcing that he will seek the job of Quebec premier and head of the ruling
Parti Quebecois. It means he is likely to take the helm of government in the
French-speaking province early next year and could use it as a platform for a
new Quebec drive for independence from Canada.
City renamed
NEW DELHI: The Indian Cabinet has decided to change the name of its financial
centre and cinema capital, Bombay, to Mumbai. The change follows a demand from
the western state of Maharashtra, which is led by a Hindu party, to restore the
city's ethnic name back from the Westernised Bombay.

Paris, Tuesday
FRANCE staged a fourth nuclear test in the South Pacific today, defying a host
of nations which only last week called for an end to its underground blasts.
Angry reactions were swift from Australia and New Zealand, the most vocal
critics of President Jacques Chirac's break with a three-year moratorium of
testing.
New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said he was ``exasperated and
disgusted'' by the latest test and described it as ``totally unacceptable''.
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's office said he was appalled and said
the test showed continued disregard for the South Pacific region's feelings.
The Defence Ministry in Paris said the blast, carried out at the French
Polynesian atoll of Mururoa, was equivalent to less than 40,000 tonnes of
conventional explosives and was aimed at developing capacity to simulate tests
on computer.
The New Zealand Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences said the explosion
measured 15 kilotonnes, equivalent to 15,000 tonnes of ordinary explosives,
roughly the size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
Gaullist Chirac, who had angrily cancelled talks with three European allies
over their support for a UN resolution condemning nuclear tests, today thanked
Britain, Germany, Spain and Greece for their backing on the issue.
He scrapped a summit with Italy and visits this week by the Belgian and Finnish
Prime Ministers after they were among 10 EU partners who voted for a draft UN
resolution deploring nuclear testing and urging an immediate halt to all tests.
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette accused EU partners of hypocrisy
yesterday for adopting resolutions in the Western European Union that defined
the French and British nuclear deterrents as contributing to Europe's security,
yet voting against Paris at the United Nations.
``You've got to be very hypocritical to say white one day and black the
following day,'' he said.
Critics replied that France was ill-placed to fault its partners for lacking
solidarity since it did not consult them before resuming nuclear testing.
The latest series of tests broke a 1992 moratorium on testing declared by
Chirac's predecessor, Socialist Francois Mitterrand.
The first in the series took place on September 5, the second on October 2, and
the third on October 27.
Chirac has said France will probably stage six tests rather than the eight he
originally announced in June. He denies, however, that the series has been cut
short because of the outcry against the tests abroad.
Chirac has promised to sign a treaty banning tests forever once the series is
completed, by May 31 at the latest. He says France needs the tests to validate
a new warhead for its submarine-based missiles and acquire simulation capacity.
The tests have also been unpopular in France, contributing to a dive in
Chirac's popularity. Opinion polls show that while some 60% of voters reckon
that France needs a nuclear deterrent, an almost identical proportion opposes
the tests.-Reuter.

PATIENT representatives fear that Greater Glasgow Health Board's services could
be jeopardised by boundary changes under consideration at the Scottish Office.
The reorganisation of local government next year carries with it a commitment
to examine health board boundaries to determine if changes should be made in
the interests of ``co-terminosity''.
The most radical plan under review would see Greater Glasgow lose Eastwood, a
relatively affluent area, leaving the board to care for the more deprived and
unhealthier city areas with a much-reduced budget.
Greater Glasgow's ``share'' of Eastwood accounts for 15 of the 20 wards in the
new East Renfrewshire district, with a total population of 599,657 - currently
shared with Argyll and Clyde Health Board.
Other losses from Greater Glasgow could include Clydebank, with 11 out of the
22 wards in the new Dumbarton and Clydebank District, whose 45,717 population
is also shared with Argyll and Clyde; the Stepps and Moodiesburn area - four
wards out of 69 in the new North Lanarkshire, population 16,758, and
Rutherglen/ Cambuslang, 13 wards out of 74 in South Lanarkshire, population
56,042, each shared with Lanarkshire Health Board.
If all these re-allocations took place, the board area would comprise the City
of Glasgow (pop 606,811) and East Dunbartonshire (pop 109,045).
Although the latter contains Strathkelvin and the affluent and healthy suburbs
of Bearsden and Milngavie, a health board source said yesterday that the loss
of Eastwood would be extremely damaging, coming on top of the steady reduction
in funding Greater Glasgow has experienced under the Share formula for
reallocation of resources.
Because of this, it is in negotiation with the Scottish Office in an attempt to
improve the allowance made to cover deprivation.
Mr Danny Crawford, secretary of the Local Health Council, has written to the
NHS Management Executive pointing out the destabilising effect which such a
large ``tidying-up'' exercise could have on local hospitals.
``There is a tendency for health boards to purchase services from what have
traditionally been `their' hospitals,'' he said. ``People from Eastwood, who
have normally used the Victoria Infirmary, might find themselves being referred
to Paisley, while people from Clydebank might, instead of being sent to the
Western Infirmary, have to go to the Vale of Leven Hospital instead.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ``A review has been carried out at official
level but nothing has gone to Ministers yet.''

A MASS meeting of 300 striking Lewis Offshore employees voted for a return to
work at the Arnish fabrication yard yesterday after management threatened to
put the company into receivership.
The meeting voted by 125 to 103 to return to work.
The strikers were offered a number of concessions at a meeting yesterday
morning, followed by the ultimatum from management which was put before a mass
meeting in the afternoon.
The concessions included the withdrawal of termination notices with no loss of
service, and confirmation that money would be available for a modest wage
increase.
The strikers were also seeking additional ``dig money'' for workers travelling
from the mainland, and a review of apprenticeships, safety, and first aid at
the yard.
The wage negotiations are now expected to be completed by December 8 and
implemented by December 11.
Mr John Naan, a spokesman for the workforce, said after the vote: ``We will now
be reporting the outcome of the ballot to the management. Some of the workforce
will be returning tonight. Nobody wanted to see the yard close but there are
still a lot of things to be sorted out. For example, we want to know what the
company means by a ``modest'' increase''.
Later, Mr Bruce Crabtree, the Dingwall-based regional representative of the GMB
union, said: ``After two lengthy meetings, the workforce have accepted the
proposals put forward by the company that the dismissal notices would be
withdrawn, that they return to work, and that pay negotiations will commence
today.
``There is still a lot of ill-feeling about what happened last Friday when the
men were sacked for implementing an overtime ban because of a lack of progress
on wage negotiations.
``It was a close vote.......We hope now that we will be able to secure better
wages when the negotiations start today.
``I think there needs to be some sincere discussions now because at the moment
there is a feeling of distrust. The threat of the company going into
receivership was taken very seriously. We were nearly at the brink because of
the distrust the workers feel towards the management.''
Mr Peter Webster, managing director of Lewis Offshore, said: ``I am absolutely
delighted that together we have progressed towards resolving this matter and
look forward to the men returning to work so that we can quickly restore the
confidence of our clients and secure a positive future for all.''
At present, Lewis Offshore is working on three contracts - a jacket and piling
contract for Texaco and piling work for a Monaco firm.

A MAN accused of murdering his wife and creating an elaborate plot to cover his
tracks told police he arrived home to find a stranger in a clown mask holding a
knife to her throat, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Gordon Wardell, 42, denies murdering his 39-year-old wife at their home in
Bonneville Close, Meriden, Warwickshire, on September 11 last year.
It has been alleged that he faked a raid at the Woolwich Building Society
branch where she worked in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, to make it look as if she
had been killed by robbers.
After police found him tied up and gagged in the couple's home he was taken to
hospital claiming he had been attacked by a gang, one of whom was dressed as a
clown.
Ambulanceman Ronald Evans told Oxford Crown Court that Mr Wardell was conscious
although his eyes were shut when he arrived at the house at around 2pm on
September 12.
``He had injuries to his wrist and bruises to his abdomen. They were like he
had been tied, bound tightly, with indentations on both wrists,'' said Mr Evans.
Mr Wardell was put on a heart monitor. Although he appeared stable, his heart
was beating fast.
Constable David Patterson said Mr Wardell told him his wife had sent him out to
post a letter at about 8pm and he had called at a pub for two pints of beer.
Returning home just after 10pm, he noticed cigarette smoke, ``which was unusual
because we don't smoke'', Mr Wardell had told the officer.
He continued: ``I walked into the lounge and saw a man sitting on a settee. He
was wearing a clown mask and had a knife at my wife's throat.
``I was aware of two others who came from behind me. They grabbed my arms and
another put a cloth over my face.
``I was told by the one on the settee to get down and keep quiet. He had a
southern Irish accent. I felt something in the back of my legs.
``Someone hit me in the stomach, I don't know how many times. There was only
the one with the clown mask. He appeared to have a blue, all-in-one boiler
suit.''
Mr Wardell told police that someone put a cloth over his mouth and the next
thing he remembered was hearing his own answering machine several hours later.
Asked by Mr Patterson what he remembered about the cloth, Mr Wardell said:
``There was a funny smell, a strong smell. I said, `What the bloody hell!'.''
The trial continues.

Glebe House in the Deveron Valley: a handsome, six-bedroom B-listed property in
two acres of ground - well placed for many country pursuits
POVERTY-stricken Highlanders used to cheer each other up with the idea that if
reincarnation existed, it would be best to come back as a cat or a minister.
They believed that cats spent most of the day sleeping, while ministers only
worked on Sundays (we all know this is an unholy lie) and had the great perk of
occupying ``the glebe'' that came with the job.
The glebe usually consisted of a good-sized stone-built house surrounded by a
large garden in which the minister could grow his ain kale and cabbages.
Apart from the laird, the minister usually lived in the largest house in the
district - so when they come on the market these properties often become a holy
grail among buyers looking for a substantial home not as expensive as a small
estate or farm.
And here is one such chance. Inverness agent Finlayson Hughes is selling Glebe
House in the Deveron Valley, a former manse with six bedrooms and views towards
the river. The house stands next to Glass Church, six miles from Huntly and
Dufftown and 42 miles from Aberdeen.
Situated in two acres of ground, it is a handsome B-listed property of stone
construction with harling and a slate roof. The lounge, drawing room, and
dining room have plaster cornices and deep skirtings. The upper floor has six
bedrooms, three bathrooms, and four other rooms. Used until recently as
dormitory accommodation for a local public school, the house needs upgrading
and redecorating.
``Some of the finest country houses in Scotland were attached to churches and
Glebe House is no exception,'' says Lesley-Ann Fraser of Finlayson Hughes.
``The area is known for its excellent sporting pursuits including stalking,
shooting and fishing, with skiing at Glenshee and the Lecht easily accessible.''
Offers over #110,000 are invited for the house and grounds. At the rear of the
building is a traditional stable with four stalls, a garage and other stores.
These are not included in the sale but could be acquired by separate
negotiation.

NEWSPAPER publisher Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin deliberately used shares
they knew belonged to the pension fund to support the selfish interests of the
private Maxwell companies, a jury heard yesterday.
Pledging and selling the shares ``was not in the pensioners' interests. It was
a sheer gamble, was it not, a gamble with other people's assets'', Mr Alan
Suckling QC told the Old Bailey.
He said that, in 1991, both father and son knew the Robert Maxwell Group was in
desperate financial straits and surviving on a hand-to-mouth basis, so they
used #100m of shares in the Israeli company Scitex, which they knew belonged to
the pension fund, to stave off the crisis. The Maxwells knew they were putting
the pension fund at risk by pledging the shares and finally selling them to pay
private company debts.
They knew they were acting dishonestly, alleged Mr Suckling, as he began the
prosecution closing speech on the 106th day of the trial.
Mr Suckling said that, as the crisis deepened, Mr Kevin Maxwell lied to and
misled banks to secure more time and further support.
He said that when father and son decided to use the Scitex shares, it was not
in the interest of the pension fund.
``The truth is they didn't    care. They were only interested in saving the
Maxwell empire.
``The Maxwell empire gave power and created wealth and it cannot have been a
desire to lose that.''
He said they had to keep things going, to deal with borrowings and to reduce
debt.
Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36, his brother Ian, 39, and former Maxwell financial adviser
Larry Trachtenberg, 42, deny conspiracy to defraud by misusing #22m worth of
shares in another Israeli company, Teva.
Mr Kevin Maxwell alone denies a similar charge of conspiring with his father in
relation to the Scitex shares and it was on this charge that Mr Suckling
concentrated yesterday.
He reminded the jury that Mr Kevin Maxwell, during his four weeks of evidence,
had admitted lying to banks.
Mr Suckling said Mr Maxwell's claim that his father had shown him an amended
document transferring ownership of the shares from the pension funds to RMG was
untrue.
The prosecution said the document, which has never been found, never existed.
Mr Suckling claimed it was part of a ``smokescreen''. He told the jury that
neither Robert Maxwell nor his son were fools.
He said the prosecution also asserted they knew that by using the shares they
were acting dishonestly.
The trial continues today.

A HILL walker who had been missing on the snow-covered Cairngorms for two
nights walked out unaided and then simply drove home.
Falkirk plumber William MacDonald, 44, kept a cool head during his ordeal and
walked off the mountains, calmly phoned his wife from a telephone box, and told
her he was all right.
A search party, including a helicopter, was to comb the mountains around Glen
Einich for the missing man after he had not been seen for 48 hours.
As the rescue party searched for him, the exhausted walker reached a telephone
box at Coylumbridge, near Aviemore.
The first call he made was to his wife back in Falkirk. The next was to the
police whom he knew would be co-ordinating the search for him.
He was well equipped and carried plenty of food and a bivouac bag in case of
emergencies.
Before setting out on Sunday, Mr MacDonald had left word with his wife and the
police of his intended route.
The alarm was raised by his wife on Monday morning and the rescue teams were
out in the mountains by noon. Although they found Mr MacDonald's car, the
search was unsuccessful and had been called off for the night.
Mr John Allen, of Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team, praised Mr MacDonald for
leaving details of his route.
``That meant we knew very accurately where to look for him,'' he said.
Last winter, more than 30 people died on the Scottish mountains.

Phnom Penh, Tuesday
A SCOTS nannie who was placed under house arrest in Cambodia before her royal
employer was thrown in jail accused of plotting an assassination spoke today of
her ordeal.
Although Janet McDonnell, 35, has now been freed, she has decided to remain
with her three young charges.
Her employer, former Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivudh - half-brother to
Cambodia's king and a leading critic of the Phnom Penh Government - was
arrested earlier today and jailed on charges of attempted murder.
The prince and his household had been confined to the house since last Friday
after accusations that he had planned to assassinate the country's co-premier,
Hun Sen. The prince said shortly before his arrest: ``I am not guilty, I have
not planned to kill anyone, and I will stay in Cambodia.''
Miss McDonnell, from Kilmarnock, who has worked for the family for 14 months,
said: ``It has been quite an event.
``Today has been quite distressful. I was actually on the phone to my brother
in Scotland when there was a knock at the door and the soldiers came.
``I had to stop the conversation with him to go and say goodbye to the prince.''
In a radio interview, she said she would continue to look after the prince's
children, who are aged five, three, and 14 months. The prince's French wife,
Christine, was seen getting into a sedan with him after his arrest.
Miss McDonnell said: ``I am staying for as long as I am needed.
``We have tried to explain to them that daddy was being taken away with the
soldiers and that they were protecting him.
``The youngest two are oblivious and don't really understand, but the five-year
old said `My daddy is never coming back here', and that was terribly upsetting.
``I have said that her daddy is all right and that he will come back and she
has to look after her little sister and brother.''-Reuter/PA.

A MOTHER who gave her epileptic son a potentially lethal dose of insulin as he
lay in a hospital bed is to be reunited with him.
The woman, a nurse with three other children, claimed that the 10-year-old boy
had repeatedly begged her to take away his pain and let him meet his dead
grandfather.
However, the High Court in Edinburgh was told that the boy denied asking his
mother to do this.
Lord Johnston, who was provided with psychiatric reports on the 41-year-old
accused, said there did not seem to be any risk of a repetition and he was
minded to place her on probation. The woman admitted stealing insulin,
syringes, and needles between January 1 and March 29 this year from the
hospital where she worked.
She also pled guilty to assaulting her son on March 26 at their home or
elsewhere by administering insulin to him to his severe injury and the danger
of his life.
She further admitted that on various occasions between March 26 and March 29 at
the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh she again assaulted the boy
by administering insulin, again to his severe injury and the danger of his life.
She was originally charged with attempted murder but her pleas to reduced
charges were accepted by the Crown.
Mr James Campbell, advocate-depute, told the court that the victim had suffered
from medical problems almost from birth and developed epilepsy from about the
age of five.
In the weeks leading up to the present offences, the accused spoke to
colleagues at work about her son's condition. Some of her workmates gained the
impression that his condition was terminal.
She asked about insulin - whether it was fatal and could be detected after
death.
On March 26, the boy had an epileptic fit after complaining of a headache. The
mother summoned medical help and her son was admitted to the Royal Hospital for
Sick Children.
Because of the ``incredibly high'' level of insulin in his body, doctors
considered the possibility that he was suffering from a tumour which was
producing the substance. However, tests proved that was not the case.
The doctor in charge of his treatment thought it was possible that the insulin
was still being administered as the child lay in hospital. His drip was checked
and was found to be contaminated.
The mother was detained the following day and informed that she was being
charged with endangering her son's life.
After being charged, she broke down and told police: ``I didn't intend to
murder him. I just wanted to do what he asked me to do.
``He has begged me and begged me. I love him more than anything in the world
but I hate to see him suffering. I wanted to give him a bit of peace.''
In a taped interview, she said her son had suffered from epilepsy and migraines
for five years.
``For the past 18 months, he has been constantly asking me to take away his
pain. My father died five years ago and he has begged me to let him be with his
granddad.''
She admitted that she had given him 200 units of soluble insulin. After her son
was taken to hospital, he kept saying it hadn't worked and she added insulin to
his drip.
The advocate-depute told the court that when the boy was interviewed he did not
accept that at any time he had expressed a desire to be reunited with his
grandfather or for his mother to take extreme action.
He appeared to have suffered no after-effects.
Mr Gordon Jackson QC, defence counsel, said that on occasions the boy became
violent if he didn't get what he wanted.
At the end of the 1980s, his mother had a still-born child and her father died
of terminal cancer. Psychiatrists took the view that she had never really
recovered from this.
Mr Jackson added: ``The stress within the family became such that it seems
clear that the mother became mentally ill and had a breakdown.''
A doctor who knew the family believed her actions were a cry for help rather
than an attempt to cause serious damage to her son.
Lord Johnston said there was nothing to suggest that there was any risk of a
repetition and Mr Jackson explained that two psychiatrists were involved with
the family full-time.
After her arrest, the accused had been given bail on condition that she did not
have contact with any of her children. The children had now written to the
court saying that they wanted her back.
Lord Johnston said he had a probation order in mind but would need another
social work report.
He continued the case until December 12 and informed the accused that until
then she was free to go without any restrictions on her liberty.
Reporting restrictions banning the identification of the boy were not lifted.

Jerusalem, Tuesday
ACTING Prime Minister Shimon Peres formed a new Israeli Government today,
placing himself in firm control of Middle East peace talks started by his
assassinated predecessor Yitzhak Rabin.
Peres told a meeting of his Labour party in Tel Aviv that, like Rabin, he would
also be Defence Minister.
Former army chief Ehud Barak, a candidate for that post, was made Foreign
Minister.
Peres strengthened his grip on negotiations with the PLO and Syria by
appointing his protege Yossi Beilin as a minister in the premier's office.
Beilin, the Economics Minister, has been deeply involved in the peace process.
Peres, who will head a centre-left coalition of Labour, the left-wing Meretz
party, and centre-right Yeud faction like Rabin, tried to broaden its base by
including rabbi Yehuda Amital from the dovish religious party, Meimad.
Peres may need the support of religious parties in the Knesset, where he has a
wafer-thin majority, to forge ahead with Rabin's peace policies which have
split the nation.
``We will fight, without compromise, the phenomena of violence and murder in
the state of Israel. Together with this, we will do our utmost to heal the
divisions in the country,'' Peres told reporters before announcing his Cabinet.
Peres has promised to continue the policies of Rabin, who was assassinated on
November 4 by a religious Jew opposed to his handover of land to the
Palestinians.-Reuter.

Crime writer, novelist, criminal lawyer, and journalist Frances Hegarty has a
personality of conflicting aspects. JULIA LANGDON describes her infinite
capacity to surprise
THERE can be few more unhappy experiences than watching a loved member of the
family lose his or her mind and reason to Alzheimer's disease. One imagines
that it is something that must be peculiarly painful to undergo, more perhaps
even for the relatives than for the increasingly befuddled victim, and that it
must be an intensely personal, private unhappiness.
The idea of writing a book about the subject seems surprising, perhaps slightly
tasteless or offensive - unless of course it was to be some kind of helpful
guide to assist caring relatives in handling this trauma. Frances Hegarty is a
person, however, with an apparent infinite capacity to surprise. Her mother is
in the tenth year of Alzheimer's; yet the daughter has not only written a book
about an elderly woman with the disease, but has constructed a psychological
thriller around the relationship between the victim and her daughter.
Heartless? Insensitive? Not at all; rather the opposite, in fact, and the
exercise is a useful illustration of the conflicting aspects of the personality
of Hegarty. It is hard to know where to start in explaining this, but probably
the easiest point is that she is probably better known not by her own name, but
as the crime writer Frances Fyfield - which, as it happens, was her mother's
name.
So we have Frances Fyfield who has written seven crime novels and won some
plaudits and prizes (silver daggers in this trade) for doing so. And we have
Frances Hegarty, novelist, whom she prefers to be even though the books are
harder. She enjoys being released from the obligation to have cops and robbers
and homicide and the other conventions of a crime novel and getting down to
motives, what drives people. But there was a clue in that last sentence to
another persona altogether. It was she who used the word ``homicide'' when
anyone else would have said ``murder''. For then, of course, Hegarty is also a
criminal lawyer.
She was a prosecutor for the Metropolitan Police, then for the Director of
Public Prosecutions, and now works for the Crown Prosecution Service - ``only
one day a week,'' she says, ``it sounds rather frivolous''. It isn't; she deals
with complaints by members of the public against police officers and handles a
great deal of paperwork at a desk. It is work which she likes, although
conversely in a typical fashion she also loved being in court every day for
seven years, performing as what she terms ``a good magistrates' court hack''.
There is another public Frances Hegarty: this one, the journalist. For eight
years she has written a weekly column on legal problems for Women's Realm - it
was a break for freedom, she says, when she started it and she has kept it
going because she likes it - and she does a spot of reviewing in the posh
papers, too.
And Frances the daughter? She is the second of four children. Her father, an
anaesthetist, died three years ago, seven years into his wife's illness, and
they wrote on his death certificate that he died of depression. The worse her
mother became, the worse was his clinical depression, until he just ``turned
his face to the wall and withered away''.
Now her mother no longer knows who she is and, unlike the daughter in her book,
Hegarty has not returned home to nurse her sick parent. ``It is not a book
about moral obligation,'' she stresses. There are some similarities and the
stimulus to write the book and her background knowledge of the problems
involved obviously informed it, ``but I couldn't have written directly about my
mother. It was because of both the drama and the angst about having a parent in
this situation that I wanted to write the novel.'' She wanted to write, too,
about the age-old mother and daughter relationship and about someone in the
early stages of Alzheimer's who is aware of it and knows that something is
happening.
The fictional daughter who returns home is single, like Hegarty now, has no
children, as Hegarty hasn't, and has made a bit of a mess of her life. It is
perhaps enough of a statement that Hegarty did not feel the obligation to nurse
her mother. She has very definitely not made a mess of her several lives; she
admits, though, to having made a mess of marriage. ``Having made my belated
attempt at matrimony and found that I loathed it, I felt a terrible failure, a
terrible terrible sense of failure. I was supposed to make it work.''
She is so frank, so honest, and yet one also senses that she is a deeply
private person. One of her hobbies is looking for paintings for her collection
of second-rate British artists from the 20s and 30s; another is looking at
pictures. After meeting her, looking at my notes of our conversation, I see
that I have written that she is ``chatty'' and ``friendly'', but also
``reserved'' and exuding a sense of a tension vibrating beneath her seemingly
calm exterior. She seems like someone who has had a nasty shock, but doesn't
want to tell you about it.
She is 46 and has been writing novels for 10 years. She wrote a few romantic
short stories for women's magazines at one point, but thinks that she probably
came to her writing career at the best time for her. She would have written a
lot of self-indulgent rubbish if she had started at 18, she says; now she knows
her way around the world better and can bring more discipline to her writing.
She is happiest when she is writing and it is going well, when she can see that
the plot is going to work, when she herself is interested and thus feels that
others may be as well. ``You may be completely wrong, but it's joyful when it's
happening.'' She retreats to north Norfolk, because in London there are a
thousand other things to do and she does them. And that is where she is going
now, to write the next book. She says goodbye. She doesn't reveal which of her
writing personalities is going to Norfolk. That would be telling.

FrParis, Tuesday
FRENCH students took to the streets today in a challenge to an austerity drive
by Prime Minister Alain Juppe, winning promises of imminent reform for
cash-strapped universities.
Tens of thousands of students marched peacefully in French cities. In Paris,
however, several hundred youths looted shops and a US hamburger restaurant,
smashed a car, and broke windows on the fringes of a march.
Despite scattered violence in Paris, student leaders had urged calm. The 1995
vintage protesters were not aiming to replay the left-wing revolutionary
activism of 1968 that almost toppled the government.
``There will be an urgent plan in coming hours,'' Education Minister Francois
Bayrou told Parliament, pledging to try to iron out equalities between
universities.
Officials estimated that 21,000 students and teachers marched from the Sorbonne
university in Paris to the Education Ministry in a procession headed by a pink
papier-mache pig, symbolising demands for more cash. Another key demand is for
more teachers.
Organisers put the Paris crowd at 40,000, marking the start of a week of
anti-austerity protests. Thousands also marched in Toulouse, Marseilles,
Bordeaux, Aix-en-Provence, Lyons, and La Rochelle.
Millions of civil service workers are also to strike on Friday against
government plans to make them contribute longer for a full pension.
Thousands face having their travel plans disrupted by the French strike, which
will affect rail, air, and sea travel between the UK and France.
High-speed Channel Tunnel Eurostar trains will also be hit by strikes on
Belgian railways on Thursday and Friday.-Reuter.

Darren Rodger explains the appeal of this charming and varied coastal region
THE reality of today's material world means that how and where we live has a
bearing on the quality of our lives.
Our national poet, Robert Burns, was born into a conventional thatched cottage
built in Alloway by his father William - and although he almost certainly
didn't enjoy the choice of location of the modern home-maker, he couldn't have
picked a better place than Ayrshire.
Today, the county combines the advantages of town and country living with
extensive shopping and leisure facilities, an excellent record in education
provision, and first-class transport and communications - in short, all the
basics, plus much more.
Reflecting demand, 20 companies are at present building homes on 37 quality
sites in Ayrshire, according to Scotland's New Homebuyer's Guide. These include
Ayr (7 sites), Coylton, Gourock (2), Greenock, Inverkip, Irvine (6), Kilmarnock
(3), Kilwinning (3), Largs, Loans, Mauchline, Maybole, Prestwick (2), Saltcoats
(2), Stewarton, Symington, and Troon (3).
And it isn't hard to see the attraction.
Ayrshire has been described as a great natural amphitheatre facing westwards
towards the sea. There are broad sandy beaches, rocky shores, and attractive
seaside resorts, each with its own individual character. Inland, rolling
farmland, punctuated by stretches of woodland, rises to the upland moors.
Countryfolk and townsfolk - for Ayrshire is basically a land of towns - are
close neighbours, and industry is seldom intrusive enough to spoil the
environment.
Then there's the favourable climate, with less rainfall than in most parts of
the West of Scotland, and, thanks to the influence of the sea, mild winters -
so mild that palm trees grow in sheltered spots along the coast.
The main centres of population are Ayr, Irvine, and Kilmarnock, and on or near
the coast is a string of sizable towns: Largs, with its new Viking Heritage
Centre, Vikingar, incorporating a swimming pool, theatre and cinema, and nearby
Kelburn country centre, with its beautiful walks, play areas, and spectacular
Kelburn Glen; West Kilbride; Ardrossan; Saltcoats; Stevenston; Kilwinning;
Troon; Prestwick and Girvan.
Inland are Cumnock, Kilbirnie, and Stewarton, plus a score of small townships,
each with its own distinctive character, and usually a pride in its identity.
If you're looking for shops, you're spoilt for choice with Ayr, Kilmarnock and
Irvine all well equipped.
In Ayr, the former county town and largest of the holiday resorts, large modern
department stores, including  Marks and Spencer - a sure sign of the town's
shopping potential - C&amp;A, Littlewoods, and BhS, rub shoulders with older,
traditional styles of building. The town dates from the thirteenth century and
its medieval street pattern has helped to preserve its character.
There's much to see in the town centre, including the Auld Brig of Ayr, the
neo-Gothic Wallace Tower, and a few good Georgian and Regency buildings,
including the Court House and former County Buildings.
Ayr is rightly proud of its parks at Bellisle and Craigie, both
eighteenth-century estates, notable for their woodlands and gardens, and those
at the Old Racecourse and the Low Green.
There is a cinema, the Civic and refurbished Gaiety theatres, and an ice rink.
The golfer has two courses at Bellisle, another at Dalmilling, and all the
richness of Prestwick, Troon, and Turnberry almost on the doorstep.

BURNS devotees visiting the county will want to see the imposing statue in
Burns Statue Square, and the Tam o' Shanter Inn in the High Street. Then they
can head for Alloway, via the beautiful Rozelle estate (with its nature trails
and art gallery), to visit Burns's cottage. The poet was born there on January
25, 1759, and it is by far the oldest house in Alloway, with its adjoining
museum with audio/visual displays.
Then there's the Land of Burns Centre, including the Tam o' Shanter Experience;
the Auld Kirk, ``where ghaists and houlets nightly cry''; the Burns monument
and gardens; and of course the Brig o' Doon, the possibly thirteenth-century
single-arch bridge which is central to Tam o' Shanter.
Prestwick is a long-established seaside holiday resort, with splendid beaches
and other amenities, a golfer's paradise - there is a reference to golf having
been played in these parts as early as the sixteenth century - and the town's
history goes back to the twelfth century.
Ayrshire's historic houses and castles are many and varied, but the most
magnificent is certainly Culzean. This is a dream castle, owned by the National
Trust for Scotland, created by the great Robert Adam for the 10th Earl of
Cassillis in the 1780s.
It stands in magnificent gardens and grounds on the cliffs west of Maybole. The
grounds were turned into Scotland's first country park in 1969, and in 1973 the
trust opened the splendid Country Park Centre, created from the castle's farm
buildings, also designed by Robert Adam and built in 1777 while he was
preparing to build the castle itself.
The area is also rich in historic churches and abbeys, yachting, and walking.
Ardrossan is the departure point for the isle of Arran, 10 miles from the
mainland. The island - a Highlands in miniature - is annually invaded by
hundreds of holiday-makers yet remains basically unspoiled.
The massif of peaks rising from the sea gives the island its spectacular
approach from the Firth of Clyde and provides some of the best ridge walking in
Scotland, while its glens are famous for their beauty and wild life.
Arran is also a paradise for pony-trekking, angling, golf, boating and cycling.

Warsaw, Tuesday
DEFEATED President Lech Walesa's staff today alleged fraud by followers of
victorious ex-communist Aleksander Kwasniewski, and said they would challenge
Poland's election result before the Supreme Court.
``We have reason to speak of election fraud,'' said Walesa's campaign
spokesman, Boguslaw Kowalski.
``We will pass the appropriate submissions to the Supreme Court.''
He also said Walesa's camp would seek an annulment of the election.
Kwasniewski aides denied any attempt to rig the vote. ``On our side there was
no attempt to falsify the elections,'' said a senior campaign official.
About 600,000 votes amid a record turn-out separated the two candidates in the
election in which the fiery former Solidarity movement's leader lost to the
urbane social democrat and former top communist official.
``We have evidence that ballot cards were stuffed in urns, evidence that one
members of an electoral commission in Warsaw added a whole sheaf - he was
caught red-handed,'' Kowalski said.
He also spoke of incidents where people arrived to vote only to find others had
voted under their names.
Walesa's staff also protested that Kwasniewski had misled voters by writing
falsehoods in his personal documents.
An official of the National Electoral Commission said that the Supreme Court
would have to settle any protests about the election within 20 days of the
voting.
``In the case of a verdict establishing that the election is void, new
elections will be conducted,'' said the commission's director.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Woman claims she was harassed by supervisor</HEADLINE>

A WOMAN has claimed she was the latest in a line of female office workers to be
victimised by the same man.
Mrs Jane Dobbin, 37, told an industrial tribunal in Glasgow how she was
sexually harassed by her supervisor in a Glasgow accounts office.
She claimed he called her ``scum'', ``back-stabbing scum'', and ``bitch'',
stared at her, bumped into her in the corridor, and imitated her actions.
Mrs Dobbin, from Cambuslang, and colleague Mrs Joan Pethrick, from Newlands,
both Glasgow, have accused their employer, Denholm Ship Management UK Ltd of
Milton Street, Glasgow, and the accounts department supervisor, of sex
discrimination.
The tribunal has ordered that the alleged harasser, who has since been
transferred to another office, cannot be named for legal reasons until the
tribunal's decision is issued.
Mrs Dobbin told the tribunal yesterday: ``He would assert his authority
unnecessarily. I could do nothing right. No matter what I did it was wrong.''
Mrs Dobbin told the tribunal another woman had left the company because of the
way he treated her.
She said: ``I reported it to the boss, Steve Walker but he implied I was
imagining it.''
Mrs Dobbin said she went off sick suffering from stress headaches but the
harassment continued when she returned.
She complained when she heard he had said he would come in to quit his job and
``kick the shit out of Jane Dobbin'' if he ever won the pools. A list of five
other women who had complained about him was drawn up and he was given a
written warning following another complaint.
The tribunal heard that there were two camps at the office and that Mrs
Dobbin's alleged harasser was called names.
Under cross examination, Mrs Dobbin agreed there had been speculation about his
sexuality but said she hadn't been responsible for any insulting comments that
were made.
She denied she orchestrated a whispering campaign against him with furtive
discussions and clandestine meetings. She also denied a colleague had been
called his rent boy.
The company and the alleged harasser deny the allegations.
The hearing continues today.

SIR NICHOLAS Fairbairn's widow is to give #10,000 to the late Tory MP's
illegitimate nine-year-old son, she said yesterday.
The money will come from the sale of Fordell Castle and the 73-acre estate.
The three daughters from his first marriage will all receive the same amount,
despite the MP's decision to exclude them from his will hours before his death.
Lady Suzanne Fairbairn, 53, who calls herself Lady Sam, did not learn of the
existence of Sir Nicholas's son Edward, from her husband's affair with an
Australian teacher, until after his death in February.
She said that although her husband would have been against the sale of Fordell,
it had proved too costly to run and she required money to settle expenses.
They were married in the castle chapel in 1983. He was buried in its crypt at
his own request.
The thirteenth century Fife castle, which is being purchased by a Scottish
businessman for more than #500,000, was restored from ruin by the MP.
His widow said: ``I find it, to be frank, that he should father a son so soon
after we were married, really rather bad judgment on both their parts.
``I did not expect fidelity but I thought that was really not very good. It
makes the mourning easier.
``I still love him. I just feel that it was completely ill-judged.''
She denied that there had been any rancour between her husband and his
daughters which caused him to revoke #10,000 legacies to them.
She said: ``He was frail in health but his brain was up and running, it never
failed him.
``I knew he was doing it. There wasn't any money to give them. There will of
course once Fordell is sold. They will get their money.''

CHEEKY with it, that is the French Film festival, which opens on Friday at GFT
and Filmhouse in Glasgow. Now in its fourth amazing year, the festival, which
brings the cream of the previous year's French cinema to Britain, not all of
which have found a British distributor, has decided to show the damage done by
Hollywood with its regular remakes of French successes.
The film picked for this purpose is Neuf Mois, directed by, and starring
Patrick Braoude, which was re-made as Nine Months, the ramshackle vehicle for
Hugh Grant's Hollywood debut. A hilarious scatological romp it illustrates the
dangers of a transatlantic crossing.
Other films which underwent the sea change were Coline Serreau's delightful
tale of bachelor fatherhood, Trois Hommes et un Couffun, which turned into the
ponderous Three Men and a Baby, and the deliciously seductive father and
daughter generation-gap comedy, Mon Pere, Ce Heros, starring Gerard Depardieu,
which emerged as a sleazy sex romp called My Father, The Hero starring
Depardieu in another of his attempts to crack the Hollywood market. It proved
that while he was terrific on his home ground, he was anything but in the alien
world of Los Angeles.
There are many more examples, and after the screenings of Neuf Mois a debate on
the whole remake issue will be held, and about time too.
One problem with remakes is that they often result in it becoming impossible to
screen the original film, and occasionally in its destruction.
A festival highlight will be Josiane Balasko's delightful sex comedy, Gazon
Maudit, in which she achieves the impossible and makes lesbians funny. Balasko
plays a sportif lesbian whose car breaks down outside the home of Victoria
Abril and Alain Chabat. He is a relentless philanderer, who is appalled when
his wife, having finally discovered his affairs, falls in love herself - with
the lesbian.
Sex comedy is a difficult form at the best of times, but Balasko has worked the
trick to perfection, and the husband's comeuppance is beautifully contrived,
thoroughly deserved, and very funny. It should have been called Men Beware
Women.
The director featured this year is Claude Lelouche, who achieved international
fame in 1966 with the romantic, award-laden Un Homme et Une Femme starring
Jean-Louis Trintingnant and Anouk Aimee. His latest film is a sumptuous version
of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables starring pretty well everyone who is anyone in
French cinema, from Jean Paul Belmondo and Jean Marais to Micheline Presle and
Annie Girardot. It is not the film of the famous musical, but the score by
Francis Lai, Michel Legrand, and others is terrific in its own right.
Two relatively unknown Lelouche films, Il y a des Jours ..... et des Lunes, a
light comedy starring Girardot, and the bubbly Tout Ca ..... Pour Ca, in which
three survivors of divorce meet in hospital, complete the four-film tribute.
Mathiew Kassovitz's uncompromising La Haine, which I reviewed last week, is
also part of the festival and to support it his two other films, Regarde les
Hommes Tomber, a murder story made in 1994, and Metisse, an inter-racial comedy
made in 1993, his first feature as director, should give his admirers a rare
chance to assess his work.
The dashing Thierry L'Hermite, the French Cary Grant - who stars in Un Indien
dans la Ville as a commodity broker engaged to a bimbo, who has to cope with a
long-lost son brought up as an Amazon Indian - is one of the stars who will be
attending the festival.
Whereas Cinema 100 and the British film industry seem to be struggling along
showing precious little imagination when it comes to celebrating the art form's
centenary, the French cinema has shown no such inhibitions. The director, Agnes
Varda, has celebrated the event with Les Cent et Une Nuits, a picaresque tale
about Simon Cinema (Michel Piccoli), a centenarian who reviews his past life,
which is that of the cinema, with the help of a cast of thousands. It includes
Lollobrigida, Moreau, Bonnaire, Mastroianni, Belmondo, Deneuve, Delon,
Schygulla, Daryl Hannah, Harrison Ford, and many more. Although a bit of an in
joke for mass audiences, it is the perfect festival bonne bouche.
The festival's patron, Jeanne Moreau, summed up the achievement of the
directors, Alan Hunter and Richard Mowe, when she said that ``the fledgling
shows every sign of becoming a sturdy infant''.
n.Programme details of the 24 films on show can be obtained from Filmhouse
(0131-228 2688) and GFT (0141-332 8128).

TOYOTA created the Lexus marque so that it could have a product in the upper
executive sector wearing something other than the parent company's own badge.
Ford and Lincoln is a similar arrangement. Toyota takes considerable pains to
tailor the Lexus model range to suit individual markets, and it has had a great
success in the much-quoted J.D Power customer satisfaction surveys.
Unlike most Japanese cars, which appear first in their home showrooms and are
then phased into export markets, the original Lexus LS400 was marketed first in
the United States. It was launched there in September 1989 and soon afterwards
turned up in Japan as the Toyota Celsior.
Lexus dealerships in this country started out in 1990 with the four-litre V8
LS400 as the only model in the range. Three years later the three-litre GS300
made its appearance, and the line-up has recently been expanded with the
arrival of the GS300 Sport.
Britain is Lexus's top European market, and the GS300 I have been driving
recently was designed with strong input from a technical centre in Belgium.
Among other features, Europeans want different handling qualities from the ones
which appeal to Americans and Japanese.
The body design is partly European too. Giugiaro has been a consultant to
Lexus's parent company for more than 20 years, but this was the first time his
Italdesign studio had been so closely involved with a new model right from the
start. It is clear that his brief for the GS300 was to produce something
stylish but discreet.
At #32,995 the test car was very neat from the outside and, with its light grey
leather trim, rather cold-looking but obviously high quality inside. The
interior layout is fine, and the GS300 is very well equipped compared with
other cars in its class.
My only complaint about the equipment concerned the radio. It is one of those
seeker types which is too sophisticated for its own good. During a period of
six days it never let me hear a particular FM station I wanted for more than 30
seconds at any one time without shunting off to some other wavelength's pop
music, and in the valley at Tebay on the M6 it shifted unexpectedly from Radio
Three to a talk in Gaelic.
Over more than 800 miles in the GS300 I found the driving position very
comfortable and relaxed, although that was with my usual exaggeratedly reclined
position at the wheel, which must have been brought on in my early days by
watching Farina racing a Ferrari at Charterhall.
On the other hand, a colleague who is taller than I am but sits more upright
reckoned the headroom was marginal, and said the same about the rear.
Start up the Lexus, and you are aware right away that a lot of sophisticated
engineering has gone into this car. The engine is an unblown version of the
powerhouse turbocharged job fitted in the Supra, and it is under no strain at
all in this executive saloon. In fact, the Supra, the Japanese-market GS300 and
the Celsior (LS400 elsewhere) are all built in the same very modern factory.
Even without the blower the six-cylinder, twin cam, 24-valve engine peaks at
209bhp. That will whisk the GS300, via a very smooth electronically controlled
automatic transmission, to 60mph in just about 8.5 seconds and take it on to a
test track 143mph.
Sophisticated engine, differential, suspension and brake mountings feature in
the specification, as well as very powerful anti-lock brakes and all-round
double-wishbone suspension which contributes to the car's feeling of stability
at speed.
Three of the most impressive elements in Lexus motoring are top-rate build
quality, refined running and a specification so complete that almost no
extra-cost options are listed. The GS300 may be the junior partner in the Lexus
range, but it keeps up the standard.

SOME folk have the strangest hobbies. Chris Bacon collects picture postcards
about food (although maybe it's not surprising, given his surname.) Chris, who
lives in Edinburgh and worked as a town planner before moving into the computer
business, started buying foodie cards two years ago and has already amassed a
collection of six thousand, including cartoons, photographs, and reproductions
of Old Masters.
Before that he collected knitting patterns and it was that obsession (he has
40,000 of those) that brought him to the attention of Springburn Museum in
Glasgow. The museum mounted a highly successful exhibition based on that
collection, with some of the patterns knitted up by his wife. When they heard
about the cards it was decided they could form the basis of an excellent show.
So it has proved. Although Food for Thought features a mere 140 of the Bacon
6000, the selection has been so carefully made and the exhibition so well
designed - in a cafe setting with checked tablecloths, menus, and plates of
food - that the impact is greater than if the entire collection had been
displayed.
The show provides a brief tour of the world of food-on-postcards and a
mini-history of food itself, the collection having been divided into over a
dozen different subject headings, backed up by relevant research data.
Marketing includes cards of enormous wheels of cheese on display in Holland,
fish laid out for wholesalers in Aberdeen, and neat rows of chicken corpses.

SCOTLAND managed to avoid the embarrassment of relegation at last week's world
championships in Cairo, but the side may still be missing from the next
championships in two years' time.
The absence of the top two, Peter Nicol and Martin Heath, left the team facing
a desperate struggle and, with only a win over Austria from six matches, a drop
to sixteenth was the lowest placing since the championships began in 1981.
The situation will lead to a major rethink. ``If the top players don't want to
go, then we will have to take stock and review our participation in major team
events,'' said Norman Brydon, Chief Executive of Scottish Squash.
``The yardstick for Scottish squash may have to be individual perfomances, and
with Peter Nicol in the world's top 10, and Martin Heath at No.30, then we can
be classed as very successful.''
The association has been committed to taking part in all major team events in
recent years, but a change could be instigated when the next four-year plan is
submitted to the Scottish Sports Council at the end of the season.
However, it is definite that the men's and women's teams will compete at the
European Championships in Amsterdam in May - the hope is that the top players
will be available.

THE local Scouts were having a sports forum night and would it not be a great
honour (for whom?) if I was to take part along with a lad from Livingston FC, a
tennis coach, and a guy who knew everything about rowing. I treat such
invitations with caution.
Once at a similar event in deepest Ayrshire, I was asked who played inside left
for Kilmarnock in a cup semi-final some 30 years ago. My confession of
ignorance was accepted gracefully enough, but another of the panellists came up
with a name.
His nomination was sneeringly rejected as being wrong, which he angrily
disputed, and in as long as it takes to complete a glancing header, there were
challenges to step outside and settle the matter.
On another occasion, in the Welsh valleys, no less a trio than Cliff Morgan,
Tony O'Reilly, and Jeff Butterfield were invited to identify the scorer of the
winning try for Wales against England in a pre-war match. All three shook their
heads.
``It was me,'' roared the inquisitor, ``bloody me.''
The youngsters were very kind to me this time, even listening politely to my
somewhat hazy explanation of the laws of the lineout. Then a bright button of
about 12, who might or might not make it to his teens, chipped in with: ``Do
you get in to all the big sporting events for nothing?''
Well, yes, sonny, we do; because we are working. And because we give sport the
diet of publicity without which it could not succeed. Because nobody who wanted
to finish the season in the same job would suggest charging the media. Because
we are lucky.
I reminded myself of that as I struggled, obviously at the wrong turnstile, to
enter Murrayfield on Saturday.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, it is sometimes easier for a sinner to escape
from Barlinnie than for a press person to enter the kingdom of the SRU.
The people behind me, who I was holding up, had already paid #18 a head or #20
for a family ticket (one child), plus their transport costs to the game, might
be about to try a hotdog or two, could even be thinking of the odd jar
afterwards. I suppose a layout of #50 is not an unreasonable estimate.
This was to watch a match in which Scotland underperformed and which was live,
Bill McLaren and Gavin Hastings telling it entertainingly, on terrestrial
television. Frankly, the loyalty of supporters often amazes me.
On Saturday evening in Glasgow, you might have taken in the boxing at the
Kelvin Hall. And taken #20 and the rest to cover even the cheapest admission
and bus fare.
The next day Ibrox was bursting to capacity, as it would be for any Old Firm
match, but here at least we can say the punters received excellent value for
money. For raw passion and excitement the national game still has few equals.
Actually, for an average outlay of #260 per season, regular Rangers supporters
are well treated in comparison to most sports fans. After all, for that outlay
they might well see more than 26 games at less than a tenner a time.
That, of course, reflects a good marketing philosophy on the part of the Ibrox
organisation. They want their money quickly and to those willing and able to
pay, they offer discounts.
The Edinburgh clubs would be less than thrilled at the 12,000 attendance at
their derby. This game was live on Sky which, no doubt, persuaded a few to
linger around the pub, then switch channels when the Old Firm appeared. The
dangers of television emptying terracings cannot be overlooked.
Nor can the need for proper marketing. Personally, I would offer discounts for
rugby's Five Nations' Championship games to anyone who was prepared to purchase
four tickets for the district championship series.
The problem about the district competition is that it fits into the ``What time
is the kick-off?'' - ``What time can you be here?'' category.
Yet, after Saturday, who can seriously doubt the need for matches at a higher
level?
People tell me that watching sport in the UK is probably cheaper than in any
other European country. Perhaps. Earnings are often lower, too, and we should
remember those who cannot find work at all.
It still costs considerably more to attend a rugby or football match than it
does to go to the cinema. A seat at an international can mean a bigger outlay
than for a good lunch.
I think it all comes down to entertainment value. So long as there are games
like Sunday's at Ibrox, so long as Scotland can compete at the highest level on
the rugby stage, so long as our golfers can continue to play like Torrance and
Montgomerie, we will follow on.
Especially me. But then . . .

Impressions of a tormented genius
PAUL CEZANNE was the most stubborn and individualistic of the French painters
of genius working during the latter part of the last century, a tormented
perfectionist who could take up to 100 sittings to complete a portrait and 150
sessions to paint a still life.
Born in 1839 in Aix en Provence, Cezanne, the son of a banker, courageously
pursued his painting and fled the pre-destined world of finance. A private
income, meanwhile, ensured he never needed to rely on his art for income.
Spurned and misunderstood during most of his lifetime, Cezanne did not have a
one-man show of paintings until he was aged 56.
One hundred years after he first exhibited in the Vollard Gallery in Paris, the
largest show of his work ever organised, and one which the world will in all
probability never see again, opens in the city's vast exhibition hall the Grand
Palais. Comprising more than 200 oils, watercolours, and drawings on loan from
private collections and museums, it takes in all but a few dozen of the
artist's major paintings. The Tate Gallery in London will house the exhibition
from February 8 to April 28 next year.
Cezanne was repulsive to late nineteenth-century taste because of the way he
manipulated familiar forms and his violent use of colour.
Modern art historians revere him as the most important of the bridges leading
from the nineteenth century towards the world of modern art. Cezanne was
tormented by the feeling that he was not attaining a self-imposed ideal, and
torment is already apparent in the little-known, youthful canvases on show in
the Grand Palais.
Befriended by the painter Camille Pissaro, Cezanne was introduced to the work
of the French Impressionist in the small towns of Pontoise and Auvers sur Oise,
near Paris, when he was in his thirties. Cezanne began painting open-air scenes
and his palette became lighter and more varied, yet stubbornly he refused to
share the interest of the other Impressionists in rendering the fleeting
effects of light.
While much more proficient and lively than his first paintings, his first
impressionist canvases are much bigger, and with more an eye for geometrical
forms, than those of his contemporaries.
Cezanne returned to Aix en Provence in 1878 but his impressionist period lasted
into the following decade. The result, on show at the Grand Palais, is a
brilliant series of landscapes such as Rochers a l'Estaque (1879 -1882), or La
Mer a l'Estaque.
Students of Cezanne like to see all those years as a long period of maturation
with, as their crowning achievements, the views of Montagne Sainte-Victoire
which the artist began to paint in the late 1880s. Cezanne commenced the second
series devoted to the mountain in 1902, which he continued to elaborate until
his death four years later.

ITALY'S Costantino Rocca will replace Jose Maria Olazabal in the Million Dollar
tournament at Sun City, South Africa, next week. Rocca, currently ranked No.23
in the world, accepted an invitation to the 12-player event after Olazabal
withdrew because of a foot injury, tournament chairman Tobin Prior said.
Olazabal's manager Sergio Gomez said the Spaniard, who has been troubled by the
injury all season, would also miss the Johnnie Walker world championship in
Jamaica next month.
Rocca has enjoyed the best season of his career and finished fourth in the
European tour order of merit and fourth in the individual trophy at the World
Cup of Golf in Shenzhen, China, earlier this month.
He was a member of Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team earlier this year and
also sank a 13-yard putt to force a play-off with eventual winner American John
Daly in this year's Open Championship at St Andrews.
Defending champion Nick Faldo and world No.2 Nick Price, of Zimbabwe, head the
field for the tournament which starts next Thursday. The full line-up is:
Nick Price (Zimbabwe), Nick Faldo (England), Bernhard Langer (Germany), Ernie
Els, David Frost (both South Africa), Colin Montgomerie, Sam Torrance (both
Scotland), Corey Pavin, Phil Mickelson, Tom Lehman (all USA), Vijay Singh
(Fiji), Costantino Rocca (Italy).

WORLD long-jump champion Ivan Pedroso's controversial 8.96 metre world record
has been ruled invalid by the Italian Athletic Federation.
The organisation has also placed a life ban on a federation official who
influenced the reading of a wind gauge, and placed a three-year suspension on
two judges at the high-altitude meeting in Sestriere on July 29.
The jump had been in dispute because a man was seen standing in front of the
gauge on a day in which there were only four legal jumps among 60 attempts by
long and triple jumpers.
An Italian federation spokesman said the investigating commission, after
checking video-tapes and questioning officials, ruled ``there were
irregularities in the measurement of wind conditions.''
Luciano Gemello, a former pole vaulter and an Italian federation official, was
identified as the man who blocked the wind-gauge.
The decision leaves American Mike Powell as the world record-holder at 8.95m, a
mark he set at the 1991 world championships in Tokyo.
Women's hockey
GREAT Britain's progress towards the Atlanta Olympics suffered a double blow in
the qualifying tournament in Cape Town yesterday where not only did they go
crashing to a 3-1 defeat against Korea, but they also lost the services
influential defender Karen Brown through injury.
Brown and Eun Kyung Lee collided after 46 minutes with the scores tied at 1-1.
She was taken to hospital with head injuries and suspected concussion.
With her departure, the British defence lost much of its confidence although
Diane Renilson, of Edinburgh Ladies, dovetailed into Brown's position at centre
back.
But Korea, who had been outplayed for most of the first half, gained the
initiative and sealed victory with two penalty corner conversions by Eun Jung
Cho in the closing 13 minutes. Results:
Argentina 0, Germany 1; Korea 3, Britain 1.
Today's games: Argentina v Canada; Korea v China; Germany v South Africa;
Holland v Britain.

WORLD No.2 and reigning All-England champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen dealt a

The rules were bent for the Danish player's entry, which was accepted late by
the Scottish Badminton Union, who are now furious at his withdrawal.
The SBU are also up in arms at the late pull-out of the Nigerians, due to
political problems within their country. They were only allowed into the main
draw at the insistence of the International Badminton Federation.
Meanwhile, the event starts at the Kelvin Hall today with 105 pre-qualifying
matches.
Equestrianism
SHOWJUMPING'S four major international title-holders are set for a showdown at
the Olympia Championships in London next month.
Organisers have received promises that Olympic champion Ludger Beerbaum, world
title-holder Franke Sloothaak, and recent European winner Peter Charles will
line up alongside Britain's Volvo World Cup victor Nick Skelton.
The quartet of champions will be among a star-studded field chasing a #210,000
prize fund over the five days from December 14 to 18.
Britain's contingent, limited to 15 riders, will also include John and Michael
Whitaker as well as Alison Bradley - who, with Skelton, were in Britain's team
that won the European silver medal in Switzerland in September.
Of the home squad, 12 reached the show through the domestic rankings system and
the remaining three clinched their places in a recent qualifier at Towerlands
in Essex.
Last year's winner was Holland's Jan Tops, who is again among the overseas
challengers in an event with a #20,000 car offered as the first prize.

People are ready for a little truth about taxation
CONVENTIONAL wisdom in Westminster is that the late John Smith cost Labour the
last election by unveiling his ``shadow Budget'' only weeks before polling day.
This in turn allowed the Tories to develop the ``tax bombshell'' assault which,
21 Tory tax rises later, must be seen as both one of the most successful and
one of the most dishonest campaigns in recent political history.
That experience has wounded Labour and cut deep. It partially explains the
reluctance over the past year to publish any coherent information about the
alternative economic strategy they would employ.
The rest of the explanation is that to all intents and purposes Tony Blair is a
Tory and therefore the difference that he has from the present regime is
largely those of style and emphasis not content or substance. Thus, instead of
publishing an alternative Budget, Gordon Brown is engaged in a dance of the
seven veils with the media, dropping a hint here and exposing a tax plan there
of Labour's economic plans.
I don't think that this approach will prove more successful than that of John
Smith. Certainly the content of Smith's Budget plans left Labour vulnerable,
particularly the ``double whammy'' of raising the national insurance ceiling
and the top tax rate.
However, perhaps the basic mistake last time was not so much in content but in
timing. Labour left it far too late to rally opinion behind their alternative
plans. Thus the Tories were able in the heat of an election to get away with
blue murder in rallying middle England against Labour. Next election may well
have been different in that the Tory credibility on taxation is so shot to
pieces that scaremongering on taxation levels is more likely to produce bloody
noses for Tory canvassers than votes in the ballot boxes. After all the average
family has been left reeling from an effective 7p in the pound tax rise or
around #600 out of annual income.
However, if people are cynical about the Government how are they likely to feel
about Labour who have taken to simultaneously telling the low paid and the
higher earners that they are going to be in the pink with Brown as Chancellor?
This is the moment when all opposition parties should be spelling out the full
detail of their economic plans and owning up to the necessary fact that not
everyone's pocket can benefit from any Budget which places the correct emphasis
on education, health, and investment.
The SNP published such a document last week, the product of nine months of
background work and testing against models of the Scottish economy, and it
should be required reading for those who still believe there should be a clear
difference of principle between political parties. It details no fewer than 27
separate changes to taxation and expenditure with a view to increasing economic
growth, jobs, and social justice.
Since the basic rate of income tax is not altered not a single one of those
changes could be implemented by Labour's proposed Assembly while any
Forsyth-style sooped-up Grand Committee is totally irrelevant in this economic
context.
I freely declare an interest in believing that this is both the most
comprehensive and ambitious plan placed before the Scottish people. Obviously
as one of the authors that would be my opinion. However, surely the key point
is this. Whether you think the SNP Budget for an independent Scotland is the
best thing since sliced bread or the biggest lot of hogwash since the last
Natural Law Party manifesto your view can be arrived at by examining what is
proposed and coming to a conclusion.
The problem with Labour's current position is that they are leaving the
economic agenda to be effectively determined by the Government and re-enforcing
the view that the only policies they will specify are ones which will please
most of the people all of the time.
It might just be that people are ready for a little truth about taxation. It is
just possible that people on the higher income brackets are prepared to pay a
little more in exchange for decent public services and greater social cohesion.
There even may be now the realisation that the highest marginal tax rates are
being faced by some of the poorest people in the community as a result of the
interaction of tax, national insurance, and benefits.
It is perhaps significant that when Stephen Hendry's manager, Mr Ian Doyle, was
threatening to see his star exit Scotland stage left he seemed to be under the
impression that oor Stephen was already paying an effective rate of tax and
national insurance of 50%. The reality for Stephen is a rate some 10% below
that. However, reality for many low-income families is an 80% tax rate or in
extreme cases 97%.
I suspect that many high earners would be prepared to stump up the 50% to see
these anomolies removed just as I am sure that a decent health service which
didn't appropriate pensioners' homes when they move into residential care is
further up most people's list of priorities than the abolition of capital gains
tax. Abolition of the means test on residential care would also cost half as
much as financing another fat cats bonanza through capital gains tax.
What I am sure of is that all income brackets would appreciate the simple truth
of knowing where they would stand. Without vision the people may perish and
without clear alternatives real politics grinds to an unsavoury halt.

IT'S an invisible crime but one that costs #100m a year, and this morning the
communications industry is launching a campaign to crack down on mobile phone
fraud.
The Federation of Communication Services is urging the Government to reform the
Telecommunications Act 1984 to make the possession or supply of mobile phone
cloning equipment illegal. At the moment, the state-of-the-art #3000 hand-held
scanners can be bought quite legally.
The conmen use the scanners to tune into people's mobile phones while they are
being used, then copy the phone's electronic serial number and phone number.
That information is then reprogrammed into another phone and can be sold on the
black market.
All calls made on the new phone go straight on to the original phone bill.
The FCS estimates that around 4000 phones a month are being cloned and the
incidence of cloning is believed to have risen 500% between August of 1994 and
1995. It's estimated that as many as 20 cloning operations are occurring at any
one time, and most of the ``stolen'' calls are placed overseas.
Officials say the cloning is having a damaging effect on the mobile phone
industry and that for the sake of future development and success of the
industry action must be taken now.
At the moment, the mobile phone industry employs about 41,000 people but that
number is expected to rise to 80,000 by the year 2000. In 1993, the industry
contributed about #3 billion to the UK's GDP.
The FCS said they will be lobbying MPs to try to find one who will sponsor a
Private Members' Bill to amend the Telecommunications Act to outlaw the
possession and supply of cloning equipment, with a maximum penalty of five
years imprisonment.
``Criminals, often working in highly organised units, are able to use hi-tech
equipment to clone mobile phone numbers,'' said FCS chairman Johnathan Clark.
``This anomaly in the law, which costs the mobile phone industry and consumers
more than #100m annually, needs to be rectified. The only way this can happen
is by amending the Telecommunications Act.''
For the unwitting customer the first sign that anything is wrong is an
unusually large bill arriving through the post.
Glasgow-based photographer Lewis Segal fell victim to the crime earlier this
year. He thinks he was targeted as he sat using his phone in a traffic jam on
the M8 at Charing Cross.
``I didn't know my portable number had been stolen until Vodaphone told me that
60 calls had been made from my number in one night. Fortunately the company is
not charging me for the calls that were made, but I have heard of one mobile
user who had to pay a #3000 bill after his number was stolen.''
Mr David Danielli, spokesman for Vodaphone, said the crime was growing apace
with the popularity of mobile phones and was a great concern for the industry.
``It's in proportion with the explosive growth of mobile communications. For
example, in the past month we have taken on an extra one million subscribers
and Cellnet have done the same. It's to be expected that cloning would rise.''
Mr Danielli said the industry operators had been developing their own
initiatives to try to tackle the fraud, including a system called TACS
Authentication which will be up and running by the spring.
TACS adds a third, constantly changing number to a mobile phone's existing
number and electronic serial number. ``The new number will be different for
every outgoing call,'' said Mr Danielli. ``The scanners won't be able to clone
a number that rapidly changes. We'll also be lobbying the Government to create
a criminal offence for the intention of misusing scanning equipment. It can be
bought quite legally and it is quite expensive but obviously they are not
beyond the reach of those who are determined to clone.''
Mr Clark said the FCS were confident of being able to persuade Parliament to
act in some way.
``We believe that because of the huge scale of mobile phone fraud in the UK,
and the prevalence of organised crime in conducting the fraud, MPs from both
sides of the House of Commons will accept the need for the law to be tightened.
Ian Taylor, the Science and Technology Minister, has already said that it is an
area which the Government is keen to address.''

THIS year's Wimbledon Championships made a profit of #27.9m, equalling the
record set last year.
The surplus, announced at a Lawn Tennis Association news conference in London
yesterday, would have been higher had it not been for the fact that the All
England Club is having a new No.1 court built. That is likely to be completed
by the end of next year.
The LTA announced that they are to invest an initial #1m to launch the scheme
and they project an annual #5m to be spent on it for the next five years.
They hope to establish 450 community tennis clubs in Britain - each offering
development programmes and top-class tennis facilities - as they attempt to
change the perception of tennis as an elitist, middle-class sport to one for
the masses.
Ian Peacock, the LTA chief executive, said: ``The objective is to create a
partnership with clubs, schools, and local authorities that can breathe new
life into the sport at grassroots level and provide the depth of talent we need
to secure its future.''
At least one million schoolchildren will be provided with tennis coaching over
the next five years and the LTA will double their national schools training
programme to reach teachers in more than 2500 schools.

RUGBY ROUND-UP
INJURED England flanker Tim Rodber yesterday alleged that he was the victim of
a stamping incident during Saturday's Test against South Africa at Twickenham.
The Northampton forward suffered severe bruising and nerve damage through his
left arm during England's 24-14 defeat and had to come off after 65 minutes.
He said: ``I got stamped on after about 10 minutes. It happened after I'd
tackled Kruger following a scrum. I couldn't feel my arm or my hand and as the
game went on, it got much worse. I didn't have much choice but to come off.''
Rodber expects to have recovered in time for the Test against Western Samoa on
December 16.
Meanwhile, New Zealand's Jonah Lomu yesterday urged England to change their
style if they want to win the 1999 World Cup. ``The All Blacks had to change
their style back in 1994. We had to open up the game and adopt a 15-man
approach,'' said Lomu. ``That put bums on seats and made the game more
attractive to watch. After all, people come to watch players running with the
ball.
``The game is getting faster and faster. England have a good back line with
some excellent runners, but they don't seem to know how to use them. They
caused us plenty of problems in the World Cup semi-final when they ran the ball
and I don't know why they don't do more of it.''

SO IS it a slap in the face for Michael or egg on the face of George? Are we
hearing the sound of businessmen marching proudly to the tune of a Scottish
parliament or sleepwalking towards catastrophic constitutional change?
The four parties were all thrashing out at each other yesterday, bandying
charge and counter-charge, but the initial reaction of a somewhat sceptical
press corps was disappointment that the survey of members of the Scottish
Chambers of Commerce seemed such a fudge.
Loosely worded, open-ended questions elicited vague and sometimes conflicting
responses which enabled all sides to claim a victory of sorts, but none to
clinch their case.
It would be reasonable to conclude, however, that Scottish business, on this
evidence, does not seem to be as overwhelmingly hostile to constitutional
change as had previously been supposed. But how much more interesting the
exercise would have been had it asked firmer questions, forcing less equivocal
responses.
The strongest statistics come by combining those in the business community who
now believe a Scottish parliament would be good for their operating environment
with those who accept that at least it would not make things any worse.
If levels of hostility to constitutional change are falling, and that does seem
to be a fair conclusion to draw from the survey, then ultimately that can only
be bad news for a Conservative Party which has put the defence of the status
quo at the heart of their agenda.
And if hostility is giving way to resigned acceptance, argue supporters of
reform, how long before business warms to the possibilities and becomes more
committed? Just four years ago Scottish Chambers canvassed 8000 members and got
a 10% response to a clear question of preference between a Scottish parliament
(28% in favour) and the status quo (67% support).
A few months later two other polls asked a similar question but also asked
about the SNP policy of independence in Europe. The poll for the Scotland on
Sunday newspaper found 64% supporting the status quo, 27% in favour of
devolution and 7% opting for independence, while the equivalent figures in a
BBC Reporting Scotland survey were 61%, 32%, and 3%.
Yesterday's survey did not ask the question quite so bluntly, instead querying
what impact the respondents thought various options for change would have on
the business environment, and offering a ``no change'' choice. It is by combing
the tally for those who think change will improve the climate with those who
think it will leave it the same that the totals begin to indicate a sea change.
The acting director general of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, Mr Peter Dunn,
believes he is detecting that change among his members and he was most keen to
push forward a broader political debate in the business community yesterday.
At one point he lamented: ``It is time for the business community to look at
devolution and time for the politicians to talk to the business community and
listen to them.
``Clearly the business community is not happy with the Government and not happy
with the representation they receive from politicians. They are looking for
change.''
This is most odd, unless seen as an accusation that the Conservative Party has
grown complacent about a sector it has been seen historically as having in its
pocket. If businessmen and women now feel they have been taken for granted,
this is something we can expect energetic Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to
take immediate action to put right.
The warning signs have been there for some time, after all. Public spending
cuts have hit the construction industry particularly hard, and a string of
blue-chip companies have cancelled or cut their donations to Tory Party coffers
- most recently plant hire firm Hewden Stuart on the advice of their
ex-chairman Sir Matthew Goodwin, a former party treasurer.
But what of Mr Dunn's general complaint that all politicians are failing to
talk and listen to the business community? This seems even more strange. For
months now journalists have been bombarded with information about the latest
measures being taken by all the Opposition parties to woo business.
Labour has its Scottish Industry Forum, which at a string of high-profile
meetings this year has seen the party offer reassurance and seek feedback from
business. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have established a business group
convened by party leader Jim Wallace and led by paper industry chief Stefan Kay.
And SNP business spokes-man Fergus Ewing, aided by former salmon farming boss
David McCarthy, have spent months beating a path to entrepreneurs' doors. The
SNP's budget proposals have been turned into a singing-and-dancing roadshow
with videos and slide-shows which is now being toured round special-interest
groups, with particular attention being given to local chambers of commerce.
Mr Dunn said of the survey's findings: ``There is an ignorance out there and as
the main business support organisation we have a duty to correct that. Well,
perhaps not ignorance, but confusion about what is being proposed.''
But if there has been a communication breakdown between the two communities of
politics and business, it appears that it has been the latter that has not been
listening. If their ears are now pricked, and they are listening to the sweet
words of the politicians, there is no way of knowing how the tide may shift
next.

ONLY 64 miles of competitive driving in today's final leg of the Network Q RAC
Rally stand between Colin McRae and the accolade of becoming Britain's first
world rally champion.
For the past three days the Lanark driver has been engaged in a fierce battle
with his Subaru team-mate, Carlos Sainz.
McRae demoralised the Spaniard with a stunning performance in last night's
final special stage.
In the gloom of Hafren Forest, he left Sainz open-mouthed by powering through
the 18-mile special stage 22 seconds quicker than his team-mate, to move into a
17-second overnight lead.
When punctures have not intervened, McRae has consistently been the quickest
driver - a fact his Spanish adversary was ready to admit.
The combined performances of the two Impreza drivers have wreaked havoc with
the world-class field, who have tried in vain to match their speed and daring.
First to go was Tommi Makinen (Mitsubishi) who led at the end of Sunday's
opening event. The Finn was soon followed by former British champion Malcolm
Wilson (Ford Escort) who crashed, without injury, in the rally's longest stage,
the 39 miles in Kielder Forest.
During Monday's leg through Northumberland and the Lake District, McRae was
fastest over six of the seven special stages but gained only one place, ending
the day in second place overall and 39 seconds behind Sainz, a legacy of two
front punctures and suspension damage.
Yesterday, over slippery Welsh forest roads, McRae began his counter-attack,
recording fastest times on all but one of the speed tests to overturn Sainz's
lead.
``Today's stages have been very difficult and it would be easy to make
mistakes. But, I've been driving well within my limits and I'm a little
surprised that my times are so much quicker than anyone else. Perhaps others
are being a little too cautious,'' said McRae.
Richard Burns and his nagivator, Robert Reid, moved into third place after the
Mitsubishi Lancer of Sweden's Kenneth Eriksson plunged off the road and into a
river on stage 17.
Burns and Reid, the 1993 British champions, now are on course to give Subaru a
1-2-3 overall, and the manufacturer's title in the world championship.
Alister McRae - Colin's brother - is quickly readapting to four-wheel-drive and
turbocharged engine power and is on target to record his best performance in a
world championship.
Despite barrell-rolling his hired Ford Escort on Monday, he has consistently
produced quick times to go into today's final leg of seven stages in a safe
fifth place, 16 minutes ahead of the next driver.
``I'm driving fast enough to make sure that there are no mistakes which could
cost me a top-five finish. Having witnessed Kenneth Eriksson's misfortune, I
know how easy it is to slip up,'' said Alister.
Robbie Head, on his debut driver in a two-litre Renault Clio Maxi, was
nineteenth overall.
He overturned his car on Monday's second leg while challenging Finland's Jarmo
Kytolehto (Nissan Sunny) for the lead in the category.
Welshman Gwyndaf Evans, driving a Ford Escort RS 2000, demoted the Finn to
second place in the category on Monday and, with a 2min 7sec lead, looks set to
repeat last year's victory. The 1445-mile, 28-stage rally, finishes in Chester
this afternoon. Leading placings (after 21 of 28 special stages):
1, C McRae/D Ringer, Subaru Impreza, 4hr 09min 40sec; 2, C Sainz/L Moya, Subaru
Impreza, 4-09-57; 3, R Burns/R Reid, Subaru Impreza, 4-14-45; 4, B Thiry/S
Prevot, Ford Escort, 4-15-46; 6, A McRae/C Wood, Ford Escort, 4-18-39.
q REIGNING Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher test drove a Ferrari
for the first time yesterday but failed to keep pace with the man he replaced
in the Italian team. He was more than a second slower than Jean Alesi, who will
take Schumacher's place at Benetton next season.

OF his monumental tobacco habit he once said: ``It's just the tar that's
holding the lungs together.'' But that was some 20-odd years ago, a bit of
comic business for an audience of Edinburgh students, and whatever it is that
explains the durability of Norman MacCaig, born on November 14, 1910, it isn't
the medicinal properties of Embassy Regal.
``Any fool can be obscure,'' he told an interviewer a few years back, talking
of the rocky road to poetry, ``but to be lucid is hellish difficult.''
So difficult is the sullen art, in fact, that Scotland's most admired poet in
English has spent 40 years making it look easy. ``I'm asked `how long does it
take you to write a poem, Norman?' And I say `two fags'. Sometimes it's only
one.''
The former Edinburgh schoolmaster, raised above his father's chemist shop in
Dundas Street, has always claimed that this self-deprecation is not a pose,
that he does not rewrite, and (none too convincingly) that the poems just end
where a sheet of paper ends - hence the fact that he has rarely written a long
one. But now, at 85, all those little verses have mounted to a cairn, and
MacCaig seems more completely a Scottish poet than many others with louder,
more imperious voices.
In part this is because he combines the rural and the urban, in part because he
is a Lowlander of Gaelic extraction, and mostly it is because the virtues of a
traditional Scottish education - Edinburgh's High School, classics at the
university, the life of a dominie - come alive in his wry, sceptical, formally
pure, teasing, and coolly empiricist lines: ``I am growing, as I get older/ to
hate metaphors - their exactness/ and their inadequacy.''
MacCaig's mother's people were Gaels from Scalpay, off Harris. His father came
from Dumfries, the son of a Gael from Argyll. As a child he discovered the
meaning of ancestry during holidays among his Hebridean relatives; as a youth,
alone with a bicycle and a tent, he roamed the country, falling in love with
Assynt, inspiration for one of his rare long poems, in particular. For decades
he was an indefatigable hill walker (``Landscape and I get on together well'').
But MacCaig is also, and overwhelmingly, Edinburgh's laureate. If sometimes the
formal perfection of his poems can seem like a reflection of nature's order,
both organic and wholly symmetrical, his urban verses feel as if they are built
from the stones of the capital. Their spirit, too, is flinty and undeceived,
like the city and the man - a ``born atheist'' who began the Second World War
locked up in Edinburgh Castle as a conscientious objector.
I gulp down winter raw. The heady/ Darkness swirls with tenements./ In a brown
fuzz of cottonwool/ Lamps fade up crags, die into pits./ Classical rigour,
Edinburgh irony, a deep feeling for wild places, undeceived language, and a
populist gift for images which surprise but rarely perplex: MacCaig is a
paradox, a major minor poet whose greatest achievement has been to conceal the
huge amount of art and craft that has gone into the work. Plainly he takes his
work seriously; publicly he has long maintained that poetry is just something
that happens, an appetite that summons him.
To hear the story told (and it has been told often enough) MacCaig began to
write verse when given the choice of writing a poem or an essay for a school
exercise. ``Sturdy Scottish pragmatism'' reminded him that ``well, a poem's
shorter''. And so he began; as simple, so he would have people believe, as that.
Yet a career of apparently effortless facility had its false starts, and his
first two volumes - Far Cry and The Inward Eye - find no place in his collected
works. Written in wartime, and unhelpfully tagged as part of the forlorn ``New
Apocalypse'' movement, they are remembered by their merciless author as a
``vomitorium of unrelated images'', a disaster and an embarrassment. In truth,
they really are pretty bad.
Few poets in their mid-thirties would have recovered from the experience but
MacCaig's response was to persevere, to purge himself (a typically Edinburgh
reaction, perhaps) of fancy language and identify lucidity, the apt and the
accurate, as the highest ambition of art. That said, it was not until 1955, and
Riding Lights, that he began to come into his own.
Remarkably for a man who was Hugh MacDiarmid's close friend and
almost-uncritical admirer, MacCaig's poems show little of the older poet's
influence. He has abjured Lallans, avoided the monumental, rarely indulged his
politics, and kept egotism at bay. MacDiarmid was the central gravitational
force for MacCaig's generation, the dark star around which all others revolved,
yet MacCaig remained at all times his own man when so many others were
squandering their talent, such as it was, on mimicry.
That may be the real point about his work: he has never attempted to be
something he is not. His lucidity amounts to a kind of candour, both about
himself and his art. He has never attempted the self-conscious elephantine
``masterpiece'', and writes small, delicately-crafted verses that can often
seem like little more than the occasions for poetic punch-lines but which are
rarely (the abiding vice of short poems) glib.
At 85 he is frail but still has the look of a hawk about him, as though
hovering above a familiar landscape, ready to rise on the thermals of language,
to fall on a word or an image when least expected, missing nothing. He was
granted the Queen's Gold Medal for poetry in 1986 but the unstinting admiration
of his peers, Seamus Heaney foremost among them, gives a better measure of his
stature.
So it is that tonight Douglas Dunn, Sorely MacLean, Iain Crichton Smith,
Valeries Gillies, Hamish Henderson, Alasdair Gray, and a host of others will
gather in the Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh for a public birthday party to
celebrate the private art of poetry.
What might they give him, friendship aside, that he does not already have? In
one poem MacCaig wrote: What I'd like for my birthday/ is a box of telepathy,/
a bottle of clairvoyance/ and a gift of tongues./ But then, for this
85-year-old, the gift of tongues would be superfluous.

LOS Angeles may be best known for the glamour of Hollywood or the surfing in
Malibu. But there is a darker side to the metropolis - a growing underworld of
garment sweatshops employing tens of thousands of workers in the equivalent of
Third World conditions.
The sweatshops, like those in New York, Miami, and Detroit, are crowded,
filthy, and dangerous. The windows may be covered up so no-one can look in or
out. Behind the shadowy facade, the workers, about 60% of whom are women, put
in illegally long hours for low wages and may be forced to continue working
even at home.
Yet these places produce clothing widely worn by ordinary Americans, such as
jeans and T-shirts sold by posh department stores or the trendy chains that
dominate high streets or shopping malls everywhere.
Labour issues rarely draw attention in the US. But the media did focus briefly
on the garment industry last week when delegates of the nation's trade union
congress, the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial
Organisations, met in New York for their annual convention. Newly-elected
president John Sweeney was even accompanied by President Clinton's labour
secretary, Robert Reich, when he and 2000 unionists blocked all but one lane of
Eighth Avenue in the garment district to protest against low wages.
Yet although Manhattan is still considered the centre, the focus of the
fast-growing garment industry has, in fact, moved to Los Angeles over the past
few years, at least for manufacturing and assembly. Astonishingly, half or more
of LA's garment-making factories are considered sweatshops because of their
illegal conditions.
The investigation is still widening after what is the worst case unearthed yet.
SK Fashions was charged in August with holding 72 Thai workers in virtual
slavery, some for as long as seven years.
The immigrants were incarcerated in an apartment complex surrounded by
razor-wire fences with spikes on top turned inward to prevent escape.
Inside the concrete building, near a busy freeway in the suburb of El Monte,
agents found a warren of tiny rooms separated by plywood, and outside windows
covered with dirty cardboard. Workers said they were forced to toil for $1.60
an hour, less than a third of the minimum legal wage, for 17 hours daily, never
allowed outside and prevented from contacting their families.
Discipline was enforced with threats of rape and beatings.
Last week 11 major manufacturers and retailers, including businesses that are
American household names, were taken to court by attorneys for 68 of the former
workers, most of whom were illegal immigrant peasants who spoke no English.
Mervyn's department store and B.U.M. International were among those named in
the recent addition to a federal complaint seeking damages. Back pay, which is
being sought by the state on behalf of the workers, totals $5.5m at the minimum
wage level of $4.25 per hour.
Subpoenas have also been issued to as many as 16 companies, including the
department store Montgomery Ward. Also implicated are Nieman Marcus and J C
Penney. The workers' immediate employer, SK Fashions, is thought to have little
available for compensation.
Only $850,000 was found when the site was raided, and a paper trail of cash
deposits leads to banks in Thailand. ``Frankly, we're looking for deep
pockets,'' says Rick Rice of the state industrial relations department.
The retailers and manufacturers, who deny involvement, can be held jointly
liable if they do business with unlicensed sub-contractors. Yet such
connections are notoriously hard to discern - perhaps 100 small shops may
supply a single manufacturer. And since the Reagan era, cutbacks in state and
federal agencies have made it harder to enforce labour and safety codes.
People in immigrant communities may be loath to talk, if they are illegal, or
if organised crime is operating locally, as it is in Asian areas of Los
Angeles. After hearing rumours of illegal working years ago, state officials
unsuccessfully passed out cards in the Thai community seeking information.
The Los Angeles Times re-ported last week that former workers of SK Fashions
who returned to Thailand have been threatened after complaining or seeking
compensation for back wages. ``You have talked to the newspapers. Beware,'' one
woman in Bangkok was warned in an anonymous telephone call. In Thailand,
hit-men can be hired for as little as $20.
LA's attraction for sweatshops is partly its huge pool of immigrant Latinos and
Asians, hundreds of thousands of whom are illegal and more willing to take jobs
regardless of wages or conditions. And the trend in jobs moving ``offshore'' to
Third World countries is less prominent in fashion clothing, as quality and
speed of manufacture can be controlled at domestic sites.
Even state officials concede that half of the city's garment factories are
sweatshops. Federal labour agents have found as many as six or seven out of 10
sites in Los Angeles break the law.
Competition in clothing is accelerating because of globalisation, says Cristina
Ramirez-Vazquez, a Los Angeles official with UNITE, the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial and Textile Employees, the organiser of the rally in Manhattan
attended by labour secretary Robert Reich.
Other labour-intensive industries can foster similar conditions, especially
janitorial services, agriculture, and restaurants and hotels. But despite a few
notorious cases in agriculture, in which field workers were indentured or
enslaved, the SK Fashions case is the most egregious.

IT was Clare Henry's stingy review of this year's RGI show at the McLellan
Galleries in Glasgow that had me yawning not the show itself which, in the view
of my family, is one of the best collections of contemporary art we have seen
in a long time (November 14). I have been three times, will go again, and have
recommended it to all I know.
There were a few boring and confusing pieces, and not everyone might have
agreed with the judges. So what? The show overall is a delightful display of
talent, beauty, and humour. Clare Henry's last complaint is that the sparse
hanging limits ``. . . a more rumbustious, raggle taggle, relaxed affair''. The
last time I remember words like that was when Clare Henry criticised the
picture promenades at Kelvingrove. My own view is that the RGI show is
beautifully hung and shows off the paintings and the galleries splendidly.

I AM saddened at Mr Martin Blackshaw's letter regarding the Vatican decision
obliging Archbishop O'Brien to withdraw his imprimatur from the pack; HIV - A
Christian Response (November 18).
Though some of your Catholic readers may sympathise with Mr Blackshaw, I
believe his view is unrepresentative of Catholic thinking and reflects badly on
the compassion which the church tries to extend to Aids sufferers. His request
that Archbishop O'Brien himself be removed is contemptible.
It is grossly misleading to invoke papal infallibility. There has never been an
infallible pronouncement on morals only the weight of magisterial authority.
Far from denigrating Vatican II, Mr Blackshaw must be aware that Catholics
everywhere are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the prophetic document
Gaudiem et Spes, which sets out the church's mission to engage with the
challenges of the modern world. He should also be aware of the primacy the
council gave to conscience which thankfully underpins the pastoral approach
adopted by many priests in their dealings with mature Catholics.
I was delighted when the HIV pack became available three years ago since it
filled a gap in an important area of the senior school curriculum and was a
user-friendly teaching resource. Importantly it had the imprimatur. After
consulting my head teacher and the experienced and courageous teachers who
would deliver the RE programme I purchased the pack.
Seeking guidance from the diocesan RE adviser, I asked a highly respected
theologian to critique the material which was substantially sound subject to
amendments. A letter was issued to parents and the pack itself made available
for inspection during reporting evenings. All comments were highly favourable.
Finally, Rhona Hutchinson, one of the writers of the pack, came through from
Edinburgh and gave quality in-service training to the RE team.
I am convinced that the other Catholic schools which showed initiative in
introducing this pack also took steps to safeguard orthodoxy and I regret that
several copies of this resource now lie on my shelves with nothing to replace
them. I am confident the Catholic Education Committee will address this need. I
pray that attitudes such as Mr Blackshaw's will never prevail.

WHAT is to be done about car alarms, the anti-social scourge of the 1990s? We
already have enough noise pollution significantly to reduce the quality of life
in inner-city areas - traffic noise, shop alarms, emergency services' sirens,
and post-pub bawling and shouting - without this unnecessary added burden.
Why are they so over-sensitive? Is it not time that we had legislation to
introduce manufacturing standards which produce a device which does not go off
until someone actually attempts to hack his way into a car?
The knock-on effect of interrupted sleep caused by even one alarm sounding for
30 minutes in a street during the night is incalculable but must be
considerable.
I'm sitting in a Glasgow city centre hotel at the moment. A car alarm has been
sounding continuously for over an hour in the adjacent car park. No-one knows
what to do about it. This hotel has a bed capacity for approximately 400
visitors. Fortunately it's late afternoon, but the probable long-term effect
for the hotel of this taking place at night needs no further comment.
There must be a better solution than an audible warning. Why not simply a
disabling device which makes it impossible to drive a car away?
Have we all become indifferent to such obvious interference with our quality of
life or do we just apathetically accept it as being inevitable?

release of the first album in 25 years by the world's most famous pop group.
The Beatles Anthology containing John Lennon's song Free As A Bird appears
destined to be the fastest-selling album of the nineties.
Thorn EMI's second-half results will also show the benefits of other key
releases. These include an album of previously unpublished material from Queen,
and a greatest hits compilation and a live album from Frank Sinatra to coincide
with his 80th birthday.
A major new development for the group will be the production of its first
enhanced CD product, an acoustic album from the Rolling Stones. Enhanced CD
offers multimedia elements with CD audio. A fully interactive CD-ROM version of
the Rolling Stones' Voodoo Lounge is also to be released.
In the first six months of its financial year, EMI Music profits grew by 23% to
#124.6m on sales up almost 30% to #1129m. Number one albums in the UK included
those by Pink Floyd, Blur and Supergrass. However, the group's market share in
the key US market slipped 2%, placing it sixth behind MCA.
Within the electricals business profits rose by 36% to #78.5m, boosted by the
closure of Rumbelows and the elimination of its losses estimated at #11.4m in
the comparable period last year. Improved operating efficiency was the main
reason for the good result.
While the UK and US markets showed little growth in the face of continuing
strong competition, better conditions were seen in continental Europe and
Australasia. Thorn UK's new rent-to-own propositions were popular.
Overall, the group continued to show a strong performance with operating
profits advancing 27.4% to #179.7m. Nikko Securities is predicting a rise in
full-year profits to #515m, up from #511.5m. The interim dividend was raised by
7.7% to 10.5p and there is a scrip dividend alternative.
However, there was disappointment in the City that no news was forthcoming on
the demerger of the music business which includes the EMI and Virgin labels.
The company said it planned to reveal more details early next year, although
progress on the demerger is said to have been made already. Potential tax
problems in some countries remain to be ironed out. In the summer Thorn said it
intended to spin off its EMI music business and retail book and music stores,
Dillons and HMV, leaving its electrical appliance rental business.
The lack of demerger developments coupled with profits at the lower end of
analysts' forecasts pushed Thorn EMI shares down 24p to 1523p. The shares have
been one of the stock market's best performers this year buoyed up by the
prospect of the demerger.

I NOTE with interest the report on the backlog of cases at Linlithgow Sheriff
Court contained in The Herald (November 18).
Solicitors practising at Linlithgow have long been of the opinion that a lack
of funding at this court over a number of years has resulted in a situation
whereby the resources available are insufficient to deal with the caseload in
the criminal court.
Quite apart from the poor facilities for witnesses and members of the public
within the court building itself, each day sees trials being adjourned due to
lack of court time, thus causing inconvenience to police and civilian witnesses
as well as accused persons all of whom require to return at a later date.
It is not unusual for cases to be adjourned more than once for this same
reason. As a result, the court is struggling to cope with cases arising out of
incidents dating back to 1993 and 1994. At present cases are being adjourned to
August, 1996.
Whether or not the transfer of business on specified days in March and April
1996 to Edinburgh Sheriff Court in any way alleviates the burden on Linlithgow
remains to be seen. Like the Police Federation, the Society of West Lothian
Solicitors have their reservations particularly in relation to the
inconvenience factor caused to witnesses and accused in travelling from West
Lothian to Edinburgh and the extra burden placed on the solicitors who will
require to attend cases in Linlithgow as well as those which will be allocated
to Edinburgh.
Even the proposed Sheriff Court annexe which will provide an extra trials court
in Livingston from August 1996 may not be sufficient to deal with Linlithgow's
problem in administering justice which has now reached the stage where any
long-term solution must lie in a complete reappraisal of the needs of the court
and the people of West Lothian.
The position of the West Lothian solicitors is that the only real solution
would be a new purpose-built court house in Livingston, which is the main
centre of population for the area, with an additional full-time sheriff and
procurator-fiscal depute. It would appear that those who hold the
administrative purse strings consider that no funding can be made available for
such a project. Unless and until their attitude changes it will be our justice
system which continues to pay the price.

I READ with interest Chris Holme's Devil's Advocate column (November 15), in
which he referred to the recent KCVO bestowed on Dr David Hope, the
Archbishop-designate of York, for his work ``as Dean of the Chapels Royal and
Bishop of London''.
The article failed to mention, however, that Dr Hope has also served the
spiritual needs of state and sovereign as Prelate of the Order of the British
Empire, while it is also thought that some unofficial reasons, particularly his
widely acknowledged handling of sensitive situations in the diocese (like the
women-priests issue), may also have been contributory.
Furthermore, while previous Bishops of London have been recipients of a
knighthood (such as Bishops Graham Leonard, Gerald Ellison, Robert Stopford,
and William Wand), what is especially meritorious about Dr Hope's KCVO is that
it was conferred, not on retirement as hitherto, but following his appointment
to York.

<HEADLINE>Actors in a sad drama of our times</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<TEXT>
AT the very least Monday night's Panorama performance by the Princess of Wales
showed her to possess remarkable talents of presentation, and even political
gifts which are not at the command of too many politicians. The sadness of the
whole affair in which she and her husband have become enmeshed is a fairly
common story of our times: the stress and anguish of marital failure is well
enough known for millions of viewers to have forgotten the exalted status of
the actors in this case and remembered instead the common humanity which we all
share. How ironic that the plea for the royal family to come closer to the
people should be satisfied in such an unfortunate circumstance.
In cases of marital breakdown, it is best to avoid taking sides. Mere
partisanship misses the complexity as well as the agony of both participants
whose unhappiness in this case is widely identified. Their constitutional role
compels comment - and considered advice - all the same. The royal family is a
national institution, a national utility it might even be said, as if such
language might illustrate its dual human and ceremonial dimensions. Like most,
if not all, families, this one will have the resilience to survive; for those
who value the notion and reality of a constitutional monarchy, it will have to
be helped to survive in order to continue to serve us all.
It is no new thing for the British monarch
These are hard times for the institution of marriage everywhere and royalty
confers no protection, indeed it may even augment the risks, as the public
hunger for access to the glamour with which the Crown is understandably
associated, is satisfied by a succession of intruders who show no restraint and
are aided and abetted (with huge fees) by the tabloid press. No-one can
contemplate the public role of the British royal family without noticing its
peculiar media exposure, which is shared by no other European royal family.
Other European royals are often favourably compared to our own for their
nearness to their people, their relaxed stance, even on state occasions, and
their generally casual way with protocol. Many who commend these virtuous
qualities omit to notice how those who exhibit them are not hounded by
destructive and unfeeling voyeurs. It was indeed one of Princess Diana's
earliest mistakes to believe that she could harness the media to her own
purposes.
The Princess has now made it clear that she does not want a divorce, yet the
case for a divorce is very strong. By all tests her marriage has ended
irretrievably and neither partner wants to try to put it together again. The
Princess was at times in embattled mode during her Monday night broadcast. Any
idea that she is merely a victim of bigger, and anonymous, battalions needs to
be qualified by her evident determination and, especially, by her willingness
to fight for her rights. But no amount of willingness to fight will matter in
this context unless her husband also insists on no divorce. It is hard to see
the ground on which divorce proceedings could be plausibly contested by either
party, should the other initiate them.
The key questions concern the future of Princes William and Harry and the
formal role to be allocated to Princess Diana. Thoughts of a leap-frogged
succession straight from the Queen to Prince William can be dismissed. There is
no reason, despite what Princess Diana sought to suggest, for believing that
the Prince of Wales would not successfully play the monarchical role he has
been brought up to expect. There are, however, grounds for believing that she
could not effectively play the role of Queen since she is no longer, except in
the most nominal sense, the consort of Prince Charles. (And indeed, the
Princess does not herself believe that she could become Queen.) Constitutional
nicety might allow her the queenly role, but the practicalities of everyday
life would appear to rule it out.
In the normal expectation Prince Charles will succeed his mother and be
succeeded by Prince William in turn. That process should affect Princess
Diana's maternal rights in relation to her children, her access to them, and
her substantial part in their upbringing. Others, including the Prince of Wales
himself, will be involved in that process, but to the extent that she harbours
fears about it, these may need to be directly addressed in any divorce
arrangements. Public opinion, to which she can directly and skilfully appeal,
will not tolerate anything other than her generous treatment in this context.
As to her own possible future role, she has carved much of it out already. She
wants to be of service, deploying the communicative skills she undeniably
commands, on behalf of the whole country. She sees herself as becoming, in some
sense, an ambassador for Britain abroad. That is not an ignoble ambition - and
she is an immensely ambitious person - and it could be encouraged within limits
specified by common sense and the recommendations of the Foreign Office.
There was a fairy tale element about this marriage, but it has long d

I AM incensed by the ignorant and shortsighted outlook by John Carlyle. Such an
attitude proved almost fatal and certainly disastrous in the years leading up
to the outbreak of the Second World War when opinions such as his influenced
the powers that be to reduce our Armed Forces to such a state that it would
have been impossible to defend our country against Hitler.
This led to the death of many young and semi-trained people who were there only
because of the sudden panic and upsurge of recruitment to the Regular and
Reserve forces in 1938. Is John Carlyle so blind to the world around him to
think of HM Forces as being a machine for death and destruction? Does he not
realise that such uniformed training instills a sense of discipline and loyalty
which is sadly lacking today?
Has he not heard of the way our Regular and Reserve forces have been used over
the years in reserve work - in disaster areas, mountain, sea rescues, in
humanitarian work in Bosnia and other places where aid is needed, and at the
present time to replace the fire services in Liverpool, which are hit by
strikes, as they did before in ambulance work? Is he blind or just selfishly
myopic?
If we followed his advice it wouldn't be Cromwell's successor who would chop
off heads but the door would be wide open for others to do so.

THE idea of business parks isn't new. The first were created many years ago,
but labelled industrial estates, places where manufacturing and service
concerns, large and small, could exist side by side and coincidentally profit
from each others' expertise.
Today's business parks don't have an industrial emphasis, but the same
principles apply with regard to contract sharing. In the Glasgow area the need
for business parks has been driven by a number of factors, not least of which
is the lack of large, open plan offices in the city centre.
Despite the proliferation of To Let signs, few of the properties available can
cater for the requirements of insurance and other financial institutions whose
operations are largely telephone-based.
These companies employ large staffs - often on shift work - and need lots of
parking spaces. Business parks can meet these and other criteria and, often out
of the arterial traffic lanes, are easier to access.
A typical example is Kirkhill Business Park, Newton Mearns. Based in Kirkhill
House, a former mansion, this C W Cameron Ltd development provides 10,924 sq ft
in a parkland setting.
Tenants already installed include Wolverine Proctor &amp; Schwartz, PRTM Management
Consultants, Towers Thompson and Virtual Graphics - the ideal mix as before.
Demand at Kirkhill is set to grow, Eastwood being widely tipped to become the
administrative centre for East Renfrewshire District Council when local
government reorganisation is implemented.
The developers have received detailed planning consent to provide an additional
16,802 sq ft in new buildings, but there is still 2896 sq ft on offer at a
quoting rent of #12.50 sq ft.
Elsewhere in the Glasgow area things are also looking up. Craig Ritchie, of
letting agent Richard Ellis, says there is a distinct upturn for parks
established in recent years.
Take-up was relatively slow during the economic recession, but parks in their
first phase are virtually fully let, and some speculative development is again
taking place, he points out.
Mr Ritchie cites Academy Park, between the city centre and Glasgow Airport, as
a good example.
Ten buildings have been completed and twelve tenants are in place. Two, Groupe
Scheider and Clydesdale Financial Services, have signed up since the summer.
It is the same story at Mariner Court, Clydebank Business Park, where Vodafone
has let part of the last building to house their enquiries operation.
At Strathclyde Business Park, Bellshill, a speculative 36,500 sq ft
headquarters building has been provided by the joint efforts of Morris
Developments Ltd, HF Developments Ltd and Lanarkshire Development Agency.
John Costello, of letting agent Montagu Evans, says a number of blue chip
companies have already expressed strong interest in the building.
Companies are moving out of the cities as parking and access become an
increasingly precious commodity - and with the advent of communications it has
become less important for them to be based near their clients, he said.
Already settled at Bellshill are Mercury Communications, Lanarkshire
Development Agency and British Steel (Industry).
Just a few miles away, Motherwell's Birchwood Courtyards is also making
progress, while at the other end of the M8, the first nameplates have gone up
at Edinburgh Park. It officially opened for business on October 9 when John
Menzies staff occupied their new 48,500 sq ft of offices for the first time.
A total of 165 people will be accommodated there, overlooking the first of
three lochans to be created on the site.
Next to move in will be ICL, whose building is due to be completed next month.
``We are naturally delighted that after nearly ten years of discussion, design
and hard work, Edinburgh Park has come to life,'' said Colin Glynne Percy, of
new Edinburgh Limited.
He pointed our that Menzies and ICL will shortly be joined by other major
concerns, such as Scottish Equitable and British Energy plc. It will soon be a
hive of activity, he concluded.
It appears, therefore, that not only has the business park concept managed to
overcome the worst of starts, (due to the recession), but it is clearly the
first choice of the country's most influential companies.
The only question still to be answered is what will now happen to our city
centres?

AS the managing director of a medium-sized management consultancy, I am
becoming increasingly concerned about the desire of all the political parties
to plunge Britain into ``the single currency''. The political parties differ as
to when they think we should get our feet wet, but none seems to doubt the
wisdom of total immersion.
As a businessman I see the advantages of trading with our European partners
with a single unit of exchange, both for convenience when travelling and for
the removal of profit fluctuations as local currencies would no longer exist.
However, convenience is not a sufficient argument for turning the 15 member
nations of the European Union into the United States of Europe. As I understand
it, member states who have a single currency must also have ``single''
inflation levels and ``single'' interest rates, since how else can a single
currency be maintained? The only way such a plateau of economic levels can be
achieved is through a single, central, European Government.
Many may argue that the world is getting smaller and that nationhood has had
its day. The world is indeed getting smaller technologically, yet we are using
a geographic argument when trying to form a ``European'' single currency - why
not form a single currency with North America, which demographically is similar
to Europe, or indeed a global single currency, as opposed to forming a single
currency with Europe which takes only 40% of our goods, and does not speak our
language, even if it is just across the English Channel.
Although the politicians of Europe appear set upon this single economic entity,
colleagues whom I speak to in Germany, France, Holland, and elsewhere, assure
me that the vast majority of their countrymen and women abhor the idea of a
single currency, since it would not only lead to a central European government,
but would dilute their own currencies and their economies when it integrates
the poorer economies of Spain, Greece, Portugal, not to mention the former
Soviet bloc countries should they ever join.
I believe that the time has come to call for a referendum on this issue to let
the people of Britain speak - no political party has a mandate from the
electorate when it wins a General Election, to change forever this country's
economic structure and indeed its very identity as a sovereign nation.

THE painful reconstruction at Northern Foods is paying off and chairman Chris
Haskins is forecasting a return to strong growth.
That will be achieved partly through a stronger relationship with Marks &amp;
Spencer, Tesco, J Sainsbury and Safeway, which together account for 37% of
group sales and all are confident of increasing their share of the UK food
retailing market.
In the half year to September, there was intense margin pressure particularly
in dairy where profits slid back #6m to #29.6m. That pushed group operating
profits down 10.5% to #65m on overall turnover 1.6% lower at #967m. However,
reduced write-downs on discontinued activities resulted in pre-tax profits
being only marginally weaker at #53.1m.
The interim dividend has been held at 3.5p but a rise in the total from 8.8p to
9p seems certain. That would put the shares, up 6p at 172p, on a 6.4% yield.
Northern is reducing its milk bottling capacity by 40% as doorstep deliveries
decline. They fell 12% in the half year and Mr Haskins expects they will be
down to the Scottish level of 25% by 1997 and as low as 20% by 2000.
The company has concentrated on a much smaller geographic base and is
not-too-pleased that Scottish-based Wiseman is entering the Manchester area for
supermarket delivery.
While supermarket prices remain under huge pressure, there was some
compensation on the manufacturing side as those who are prepared to pay the
same price for skimmed milk as full cream subsidise Northern and the other
processors who convert the fat into butter where prices are escalating.
The scorching summer hurt ``hot eating'' lines such as pies while Fox's
chocolate biscuits profits melted in the heat. However, there has been a sharp
recovery in the last few days because of more seasonal weather.
The Green Isle pizza subsidiary in Northern Ireland is fully consolidated and
looks like being a winner. It is building up exports to Continental Europe - a
territory which Mr Haskins will not explore in detail until the UK operations
are running more efficiently after the completion of the #91m rationalisation
programme which has taken 4000 jobs out of a total of 28,000 employees.

THE boardroom battle at Cable &amp; Wireless, (C&amp;W), ended yesterday with the
surprise resignations of both the chairman Lord Young of Graffham and chief
executive James Ross. Both men are leaving the company with immediate effect.
A spokesman for the company blamed a personality clash for the departures,
rather than differences over strategy but refused to elaborate.
It is said to be too early to know the level of compensation that the men will
receive. Lord Young had no service contract but earned #479,247 last year,
compared with #777,163 in the previous year.
Mr Ross had a one year rolling contract and earned #391,275 in 1994. That was a
32% reduction on the previous year's remuneration. Both men have significant
share options.
Mr Ross, who was also deputy chairman, said: ``I am very disappointed to be
leaving Cable &amp; Wireless at such an important stage of its evolution.
``Cable &amp; Wireless has terrific strengths and I am proud to have helped develop
these over the past three and a half years. Brian Smith inherits an excellent
executive team and I wish them all well.''
Dr Brian Smith, chairman of BAA, who was a non-executive director of C&amp;W for
six and a half years until his retirement in June 1995, has been appointed as
the company's non-executive chairman.
A committee of the board under the chairmanship of Dr Smith has been formed to
appoint a new chief executive as soon as possible.
While Mr Ross' position was thought to be vulnerable it was not expected that
both men at the top of Britain's second biggest telecommunications company
would walk the plank.
The announcement came on the second day of full board deliberations in the face
of an ultimatum from Mr Ross that he could no longer work with Lord Young and
that one of them would have to leave.
Although a spokesman for C&amp;W said that it saw itself ``as an independent and
successful company'', bid speculation resurfaced following the boardroom
departures.
US cellular telephone billionaire Craig McCaw denied that he had ever been
interested in bidding for C&amp;W.
Any such takeover would be expensive given C&amp;W's market capitalistion in excess
of #9000m. City analysts estimate that any bid would have to be pitched at
least at #11bn.
AT&amp;T and the US cable operator Nynex, with whom C&amp;W is in advanced negotiations
on a US joint venture, have been mooted as potential bidders.
However, the success of any such bid is not a foregone conclusion given that
any prospective purchaser would have to buy out the 58% interest in Hong Kong
Telecom, many of the governments where C&amp;W operates could veto any takeover,
and Veba of Germany has a 9.5% stake.
As a high-powered businessman, Lord Young put his considerable City talents to
good use as a Cabinet Minister in Margaret Thatcher's Government and more
recently as chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless.
Indeed, as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry he left an overwhelming
impression that he wanted to run his department as a private enterprise.
And although Lord Young was an unimpressive Parliamentary performer, he quickly
acquired the reputation as the Government's whizz-kid, the Mr Entrepreneur of
Whitehall.
But those innate business and leadership talents appear to have deserted him
over recent months.
Mr Ross joined Cable &amp; Wireless after a 33-year career at oil giant BP.
After an education at Sherbourne public school and then Oxford did national
service in the Royal Navy.
He joined BP in 1959 and rose up the ranks steadily to be chief executive of BP
America in 1988.
He was appointed chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless in 1992.

SHANKS &amp; McEwan is making good profits from its core waste disposal business
and is looking fitter and slimmer following the sale of its loss-making
construction division.
But despite cost cutting, its Rechem subsidiary, which treats hazardous organic
waste, continues to operate at a loss.
Pre-tax profit for the six months to September 30 rose 10% to #10.8m and the
company, which is registered in Glasgow but now based at Bourne in
Buckinghamshire, looks set to beat its 1994-95 full-year profit of #16.3m.
Chairman Gordon Waddell said the company's tendency to make lower profits in
the second half of the financial year was diminishing and full-year profits
should be ahead of 1994-95.
The mainstay of the group is its Waste Services Division, which collects and
treats household, commercial and industrial waste and disposes of it in a
series of landfill sites around the country.
Despite a slight fall in turnover to #48.2m and a trebling of provisions for
maintaining capped landfill sites to #1.7m, Waste Services managed to boost its
operating profit by 1% to #12.1m.
Mr Waddell said Shanks &amp; McEwan's responsibility for ensuring the safety of
landfill sites could last for up to 30 years after they had been capped, so the
company had decided to provide generously for such costs.
Losses at the Rechem hazardous waste division were cut to #100,000 from
#600,000 in the second half of 1994-95, despite a 21% fall in turnover to #8.8m.
Rechem, which incinerates waste such as paints and pesticides at very high
temperatures, is suffering from tighter Government restrictions on imports of
hazardous waste as well as price competition in the domestic market.
But Shanks &amp; McEwan is hopeful that a future tightening of environmental
legislation will lead to more hazardous waste being incinerated instead of
simply mixed with ordinary waste for use as landfill.
Mr Waddell pointed out that the UK is less strict than the US and its European
partners in what it allows to go into landfill.
Group turnover fell 18% to #56.9m during the first half of the financial year,
reflecting the sale of Shanks &amp; McEwan's construction business in April.
Gearing fell to 6.3% of shareholders' funds from 30.4% a year earlier and the
company has cash balances of #15.2m available to invest in expansion.
``We are now looking for new business opportunities,'' Mr Waddell said.
``Wherever we find new business that fits well into our core activities we will
look at it.''
Shanks &amp; McEwan's business is mainly concentrated in Scotland and South-east
England, but it is keen to expand to other parts of the UK.
Looking ahead, the group should soon reap the benefits of a #12m investment in
burning methane gas given off by waste to produce electricity, an activity that
attracts heavy Government subsidies.
It already generates 23 megawatts of electricity from waste gas, but this
should rise to 42 megawatts by 1997, giving it an annual income of at least #5m
from electricity sales.
Recognising the progress made, Shanks &amp; McEwan raised the interim dividend by
9% to 1.1p. But earnings per share advanced only 3% to 3.7p because it had to
pay a deferred tax charge on Rechem.
Shanks &amp; McEwan shares rose 3p to 92p.

SENSATIONAL allegations that the SAS operated an undercover death squad in
Northern Ireland in 1971 and 1972, which killed some 30 members of the IRA, are
contained in a 280-page book published yesterday. If true, it would rewrite the
history of the current troubles. The problem is that the way it is written
leaves grounds for doubt.
The author of The Nemesis File* is a former member of the SAS writing under the
pseudonym Paul Bruce. The book is named after the alleged code name used for
the covert operation under which the executions took place. Bruce also claims
that innocent young Catholic men were picked up at random off the streets of
Belfast by his SAS unit and killed as part of a British Government campaign to
foment a real sectarian war between Catholics and Protestants. The hope was the
two sides would tear each other apart, allowing the politicians to put the
pieces together afterwards, he said.
The Ministry of Defence, which only received the book yesterday, is taking the
allegations seriously, given the delicate state of the Northern Ireland peace
process, and the gravity of the allegations. ``British forces operate within
the law and the behaviour of any members is something for which they can be
held accountable in law,'' a spokesman said. ``If the author has any
information that should be placed before the authorities, he should have done
so long before now, and it could be a matter of proper inquiry.''
The MoD view is that although the book does not give dates and is generally
vague about places, it should not be dismissed lightly as yet another Christmas
offering about the SAS, the second within a week.
The author, a stocky, middle-aged man with attitude, turned up at the book's
launch in London wearing a ski mask to hide his face. He insisted his story was
true, but refused to reveal corroborating details, claiming he was afraid of
the IRA and had received death threats.
The two sites, near the border with the Republic, where he says the bodies are
buried, are off Blackskull Road between Dromore and Lurgan, map reference
534160, and in Tardree Forest, Antrim, map reference 925182.
Bruce said he had only been 23 at the time, ``a keen young soldier proud to be
in the SAS'', to which he had been transferred from the REME. ``We killed
people we were told were members of the IRA,'' he added. ``It was a thankless,
horrible task and if I had had any idea I would have ended up doing that kind
of thing I would never have joined the Army, let alone volunteered for the
SAS.''
The men the four-soldier unit killed were handed over to them at the border
with the Republic by another SAS unit, he said. He thought they had been
brought from the Republic by MI6 agents. They were not told the prisoners'
names, and they led them to believe they were being taken to the RUC for
questioning, not to their deaths. The unit had worked in casual clothes -
leather jackets, jeans and Chelsea boots - not in uniform, he added.
At one point he decided some of the prisoners may have been drugged before
being handed over by MI6, because they seemed ``kind of zombified'' and proved
very docile. ``All in all, this was pretty boring,'' he added chillingly. He
described how one of his colleagues messed up a killing, shooting the man in
the neck, not the back of his head, and he had to finish the job because the
man was lying screaming with his jaw shot off.
He denied he had murdered anyone. ``I fought a war against the IRA,'' he said.
``It was tit for tat.'' When it was pointed out their actions were contrary to
the rules of engagement under which British troops in Ulster operated, he
replied angrily: ``Balls to the rules of engagement. We were the SAS. We do not
fight under rules of engagement. We are talking about 20 years ago, and I
thought the IRA were the enemy. I never killed women or children. I was just a
tool. I was being used by the British Government. I was just told this is what
you are going to do.''
Asked how many people he had executed he got upset. ``I did not execute
anybody,'' he said. ``I killed IRA soldiers. I will not tolerate this bullshit.
Do you realise how many people we saved? I am a nice guy. Of course I regret
what I have done, but I was carrying out orders. We were told these people had
to be killed and we did it.''
The first two men he killed were suspected terrorists gunned down in West
Belfast outside a shop where they had been buying cigarettes. The next man was
a suspect they picked up through an informer called Yvonne. It was after that
with the other three, identified as Benny, JR, and Don, that they began to kill
men brought to them for execution by MI6.
He said he had left the Army in October 1972, and that Don, his unit commander,
had been killed in the Falklands war. He was not breaking the Official Secrets
Act because that only applied for 20 years, he said. He insisted his publisher,
John Blake, had been given proof of his identity and the authenticity of his
claims, including an affidavit from a former colleague.
Mr Blake said they had his Army number and his SAS medals, and confirmed the
affidavit's existence. Bruce had also shown them the sites where he claims the
bodies are buried, although they had not done any digging, he said. That was
for the authorities to do. ``We checked him in every way,'' he added. ``He is
angry. He is not interested in money. He just wants people to know what he was
forced to do.'' Although Bruce originally claimed to have killed some 40 men,
the publishers checked through each alleged incident and decided it was nearer
30.
Bruce had been warned by his lawyer of the consequences he could face if his
charges proved true, he added. As for money, his advance was #3000, he had not
asked for more. He would, however, receive royalties if it sold. The first
hard-back print run is of 60,000 copies.

UNITED Biscuits has effectively left the United States with the announcement of
the sale of its last significant asset in that country.
It has sold its Salty Snacks brands, the US distribution rights and one factory
to a group of private investors for $8m cash (#5.1m).
The company is also closing two factories with the loss of 320 jobs in Texas
and Pennsylvania but the cash proceeds from the sale are expected to more than
cover any closure costs.
Last week, UB warned that the disposal would result in a substantial loss on
net asset value and is in fact writing off $119m or #76m.
It earlier sold its cookie and cracker business and also frozen foods.

I HAVE been much amused by the recent use of the word ``wrinklies''.
More than 25 years ago, at the age of 58 I was often in the dark on a jog which
passed under a railway bridge.
On the way uphill I saw a gang of youths on their way down. As they focused
their attention on me I edged over to their side of the road and as I ran past
they stopped, looked, and one said: ``Ach, it's just an old wrinkly.''
When I told my son about this he laughed and said, ``I'll bet none of them
could run up that road.''
How true, and how sad. I wonder what they would call me today?

THE mortgage market remains subdued, the second largest lender Abbey National
said yesterday in its autumn business report.
The bank had increased its share of a difficult mortgage market to around 11%
in the third quarter of the year, said chairman Lord Tugendhat.
The overall number of mortgage accounts in arrears had fallen 4% since the
half-year, although there had been a slight increase in the number of cases six
months or more in arrears.
Losses cut
Stockholm, Tuesday - Swedish commercial bank Handelsbanken said credit losses
in the first nine month of 1995 dropped 18% to Kr1770m compared with Kr2140m in
the same period last year.
Bad debts in the period totalled Kr3650m, or 1.3% of total lending, a 34%
decrease on the same 1994 period.
The bank reported a 17% jump in operating profit to Kr3720m, up from Kr3170m
for the first nine months of 1994.
Nestle rumours
Zurich, Tuesday - Swiss food group Nestle's registered shares were steady amid
generally bullish speculation ahead of a company news conference tomorrow.
Dealers reported speculation that Nestle may announce its chief executive
Helmut Maucher will step back from operational management, handing over to
someone who could be more concerned about boosting shareholder value.
Daimler axes jobs
Berlin, Tuesday - Daimler-Benz announced it will cut 8800 jobs in the coming
three years from its troubled aerospace subsidiary, driven partly by possibly
tougher competition from the merger talks between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas
of the United States.

<HEADLINE>First returns for Camelot shareholders</HEADLINE>

SHAREHOLDERS in Camelot, the National Lottery operator, are to receive their
first dividend from the company as its profits top #36m for the 24 weeks to
mid-September.
The five shareholders, De La Rue, Cadbury Schweppes, Racal Electronics, ICL and
GTech, will share #9.5m between them. Camelot yesterday pointed out that this
will be the first cash return they have received on their investment. The
company is obliged to maintain dividend cover of 2.5 times.
All but ICL have a 22.5% stake which enables them to incorporate their share of
profits into their own profit and loss accounts under current accounting rules.
Sales of lottery tickets and ``Instants'' cash cards came to #2510m in the 24
weeks which means that on an annual basis sales are already running at more
than #5000m just a year after the game began, when this was Camelot's target in
year three.
Prizewinners received 50.7% or #1271m and 27% (#679m) went to good causes. The
Government's take came to 13% (#326m), comprising lottery duty, tax and VAT,
retailers retained 5.1% (#128m) and Camelot took 4.2% (#106m) in running costs
and profits. The latter represented 0.9% of sales. Over the seven-year life of
the licence the company has pledged that its net profits will not be more than
1%.
Camelot chairman Sir George Russell said that in its first 44 weeks the
National Lottery had raised #1000m for good causes and #481m for the Government.
``This is the largest amount of money ever raised by a lottery in this
timescale,'' he declared.
The company maintains that only one other lottery in the world, in New Jersey,
is more cost-effective and it aims to catch this one up.
Advertising expenditure continues to be heavy, amounting to #25m in the latest
period, and Camelot believes it must keep brand awareness at a high level.
Chief executive Tim Holley noted that National Lottery had 14% of the UK gaming
market and competition was hotting up. Sales of Instants averaged #36m a week
in the 24 weeks reported but were running at #25m.
``We'll have our work cut out to keep consumer interest going,'' Mr Holley said.

THE power struggle at the top of Cable &amp; Wireless has finally claimed the jobs
of both Lord Young and James Ross as non-executive directors took decisive
action yesterday.
The shares rose on relief that the battle was over but the group faces a period
of drift until a new chief executive can be appointed and it may not be easy to
find someone of the right calibre rapidly.
The group maintained that the present strategy would continue but it could
hardly say anything else in the short-term.
Until it has a new man at the top, C&amp;W is bound to be vulnerable to a predator.
This would be just the time to strike and there are a number of potential
companies in the fast growing telecoms field to which C&amp;W could appeal.
However, the many regulatory hurdles to be overcome given the company's
strategic investments in various countries' phone networks could be off-putting.
These investments form the core of C&amp;W's strategy which was supported by both
Lord Young and Mr Ross - they fell out because they simply could not get on
together. Unfortunately, there is scepticism over how the wide network of
investments and alliances can knit together into a whole which will be worth
more than the parts.
There is a feeling that the group is finding yet more joint venture partners
for the sake of it and losing sight of the ultimate objective of earnings
growth.
An incoming chief executive faces a formidable challenge in shaping a harder
strategic focus in a group with such a wide geographical spread. Whatever
decisions he reaches, changing direction will be a lengthy process.
No hitches
CAMELOT'S shareholders are set to receive a handsome return on their
investment, with the first dividend of #9.5m comparing with the #60m they
invested upfront to get the project off the ground. Their risk was actually
greater than this because they had to provide guarantees totalling #130m, some
of which are still in place.
While it would be difficult to make a complete hash of setting up a lottery, it
has to be said that Camelot has made a very good job of it. The lottery has run
almost without a hitch from the word go and has proved very successful in
pulling in the punters.
On the other hand the UK was the last major country to bring in a lottery so
Camelot could incorporate best practice. It also had the advantage of the
latest information technology. So it would be a poor show if it was not almost
the most efficient in the world.
The proportion of sales which go to good causes goes up and Camelot's share
goes down as sales rise. When these top #3700m the company's share for its
costs and profits falls to 1.65p for every #1 of sales above this figure. So
the licence formula acts as an incentive for improving efficiency. But however
much Camelot protests about what a good job it is doing in delivering higher
than expected sums for good causes and the Exchequer, the fact remains that its
shareholders will do very nicely out of it, that it is indeed a licence to
print money.
The rules will be more tightly drawn in the next licence period but in the
meantime the Government could possibly do a deal with Camelot which will allow
a higher proportion of sales to go to good causes while also keeping Camelot
happy.
The company is interested in using its expertise to develop and run lotteries
overseas. Perhaps the terms of the licence could be changed to allow this in
exchange for a smaller share in the UK National Lottery's sales.
Time bomb
THERE is a time bomb ticking away in the food supply chain. It is a result of
the devaluation of the Green Pound and the escalation in world commodity prices
which has sent the price of wheat rocketing from $80 to about $200 a tonne
while global stocks are at the lowest level for over 20 years.
Just 53 days consumption remain compared with 104 days in 1987 and stocks are
falling one day every three months. Likewise, butter has risen the equivalent
of #1000 a tonne to #2200 in the last nine months although these have yet to be
felt significantly by the consumer.
So far, price increases have been absorbed by the manufacturer and to a lesser
extent the retailer. However, Northern Foods has made it crystal clear that it
is pushing ahead with its own price rises in an attempt to claw back the
current 1.5% under-recovery of costs which lost it about #15m in the first six
months.
It is in the fortunate position of having substantial market clout, accounting
for 4.5% of total UK food output. But even Northern has been forced to reduce
its involvement in the small shop business where it has sliced #100m out of
sales in the past year from its van trade in what is a rapidly declining sector.
It seems certain that weaker competitors will be forced to the wall unless they
can pre-empt that through rapid amalgamation and consolidation.
That is under the threat of Northern and the revitalised Unigate having
substantial acquisition muscle - particularly the latter which will have about
#250m cash in its hip-pocket within the next year on completion of its disposal
programme.
Traditionally rising food prices have been good for the supermarkets and the
increase in food inflation may well come faster than most expect - to the dread
of the Treasury.

<HEADLINE>A second chance for England's  bowlers to deliver</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975257801</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ENGLAND have been given a generous helping hand in their quest for maximum
practice ahead of next week's second Test. The scheduled four-day game against
Orange Free State has been spilt into two separate contests and that means all
16 members of England's cricket-starved party can be assured of at least one
outing on Bloemfontein's Springbok Park.
A three-day game will start tomorrow with a 50-overs-per-side match scheduled
for Sunday.
``We are very grateful,'' said England assistant manager John Barclay. ``Our
hosts should do quite well out of it, because they'll probably get a bigger
crowd on Sunday than might otherwise have been the case.''
Thanks to the washed out first Test, England were facing a real dilemma with
only one game before the series resumes in Johannesburg next week. All their
bowlers need an outing but it would have been impossible to fit the lot into
one four-day side.
Manager Ray Illingworth suggested two fixtures against Free State during a call
to South African Cricket Board managing director Ali Bacher - and 30 minutes
later, the deed was done.
Most of the first Test bowlers who did not send down a delivery between them at
Centurion Park, plus Devon Malcolm, are now likely to play in the three-day
game against Free State, and fringe performers Peter Martin, Mark Ilott and
Mike Watkinson can at least expect an appearance in the limited overs contest.
q PAKISTAN, humbled by Australia in the current Test series, will give former
captain Salim Malik a final chance to salvage his dismal tour.
Malik, troubled by injury and poor form, will be recalled for the third and
final Test in Sydney, starting on November 30, if he first performs well in the
four-day match against Victoria in Melbourne.
Opener Salim Elahi, who failed twice during Pakistan's 155-run defeat in the
second Test, is the man who makes way for Malik, who was ruled out of the
second Test because of a cut to his left hand.
``Ramiz Raja will open and Malik will come in - the stitches were taken out
yesterday, so he'll have a little bit more protection,'' said team manager
Intikhab Alam.
Shane Warne remains doubtful for the third Test after breaking the big toe on
his left foot while batting in Australia's first innings in Hobart.
Australia captain Mark Taylor said a decision on Warne's fitness would be left
to the last possible moment.
q RAIN forced abandonment of the third one-day international in Goa between
India and New Zealand without a ball being bowled. The sides are level at 1-1
in the six-match series.

BANK note printer De La Rue may have just taken in #8.1m as its share of
National Lottery operator Camelot's profits, but that was the end of the good
news as far as the market was concerned.
Yet another profits warning saw the shares plunge 182p to 718p, slashing the
market capitalisation by around 20%, as the group checked in with half-year
profits below expectations at #69.1m before tax, down from #72.8m last time.
Chief executive Jeremy Marshall said headline earnings per share for the full
year would not reach the level of last year.
The interim dividend is lifted from by 0.25p to 7.25p with a scrip dividend
alternative, but this will provide scant comfort to shareholders in the face of
the perhaps overly harsh market reaction to the package. The chief executive
said the company had had a very high premium rating.
Headline earnings per share at the interim stage are 17.3% lower at 23p,
reflecting not just reduced pre-tax profits but also the new shares issued in
February in relation to the acquisition of Portals Group. The company has, in
fact, consistently out-performed the market so it argues a trading correction
was due.
There are three reasons for De La Rue's caution about current year prospects.
Banknote production will be down, reducing profit expectations for this part of
the business by at least #10m; there are continuing difficult trading
conditions across Payments Systems markets, which have reduced expectations by
some #5m, and although its Giori order book remains strong, deferment in
customer call-off of deliveries has cut full-year expectations by almost #10m.

GRAMPIAN region planners yesterday were scrutinising two controversial
applications for university developments in and near Aberdeen.
The J W Muir Group proposes a campus, a science and technology park, and an
urban village at Blairs College, Maryculter. The Robert Gordon University
proposal features a purpose-built campus in the Garthdee area of the city.
Island causeway
WESTERN Isles Islands Council is seeking authority to construct an #8.6m
causeway linking Berneray to North Uist. The council does not have the specific
legal power to construct works in tidal waters and will seek to promote private
legislation through Parliament.
Set for trial
A 47-YEAR-OLD man was committed for trial yesterday on three counts of unlawful
sexual intercourse. Berwick magistrates at Newcastle Crown Court released James
McKenna, of Ayton, near Berwick, on bail but ordered him to reside at an
undisclosed address and not enter Berwick.
Witnesses sought
POLICE are appealing for witnesses following the death of Mr Ian Mitchell, 38,
in the south of Glasgow on Sunday. Mr Mitchell, of Meiklewood Road, Govan, died
in hospital after being found unconscious in the back court of 12 Cairnban
Street, Drumoyne, about 7.45am. He was 5ft 10in, of stocky build, with
shoulder-length brown curly hair and wore a blue shirt and jeans. Anyone who
may have seen him between 10pm Saturday and 7.45am Sunday is asked to come
forward.
Refinery work
BP yesterday announced its #50m plans to upgrade Grangemouth refinery. Work
will start later this year and create up to 350 temporary construction jobs.
Burns spurned
COUNCILLORS in the Dumfries and Galloway region broke into verse yesterday
while discussing funding for next year's bi-centenary for poet Robbie Burns but
even such inspiration failed to cary the proposal that each councillor
personally contribute #100 for the celebrations.
Bute promotion
BUTE is to be the focus of a #300,000 promotion of ``green'' tourism. European
funding is being sought by Argyll and the Islands Enterprise to improve access
to the countryside and upgrade historical and environmental sites and provide a
series of footpaths and cycleways.
Dounreay debate
GREENPEACE yesterday challenged Dounreay director John Baxter to a public
debate. The enviromental group seeks a public meeting in the North of Scotland
to discuss claims of a build-up of nuclear waste at Caithness.
Dog-eared story
A SHERIFF yesterday rejected a woman's written confession that a pet rottweiler
escaped from the garden and bit a passer-by. Michelle Birch, 29, of Woodburn
Gardens, Alexandria, wrote to Dumbarton Sheriff Court saying she was the owner
of the dog but indicating that it actually belonged to her husband. She was
ordered to make a personal appearance to explain the situation on December 12.
Tobacco seized
A MAN was charged yesterday after customs officers intercepted a huge tobacco
consignment at Belfast docks. Nearly three-quarters of a tonne of tobacco and
1.2 million cigarettes were seized and 1000 litres of beer and 45 litres of
wine were also confiscated.
Orkney shake-up

AN INCREASE in the use of emergency ambulances was blamed yesterday for the
failure by the service to meet call-out targets in Glasgow this year.
Greater Glasgow Health Board was told that standards set by operation research
consultants were not being achieved. These called for 50% of calls in the
board's area to be answered within seven minutes, with the exception of the
less-densely populated Strathkelvin area, where the standard is 95% within 18
minutes.
Mr Malcolm McVittie, West of Scotland regional director of the Scottish
Ambulance Service, admitted a large part of the 11% increase in call-outs was
due to people taking their advice.
``We have been advising people with chest pains - a possible symptom of a heart
attack - to dial 999 without delay and more people are taking this message to
heart,'' he said.
The ambulance service is to pilot a service in which trained staff will assess
the urgency of 999 calls and rate them as life-or-death, serious but not
life-threatening, and those which can wait.
``The dispatchers will be trained to err on the side of safety and it will be
open to anyone - as it is now - to call back if a patient's condition
deteriorates and takes them into a more urgent category.''
Other changes planned by the ambulance service include the opening of stations
in Cowglen and Clydebank, and the eventual relocation of the Gartnavel station.
``Being situated at the back of a hospital with nine speed-ramps to negotiate
on the way out is not ideal when you are answering an emergency,'' he said.

THE M8 Foodpark at Port Dundas has already proved a major success, with five
companies negotiating to move into 75,000 sq ft of accommodation.
Developed jointly by the Glasgow Development Agency and the private sector, the
#8.5m foodpark enjoys an ideal location. Only half-a-mile from the heart of
Glasgow, it has easy access to the M8 motorway.
Main contractors Lanrec began work last January on the infrastructure of the
park, which will offer 140,000 sq ft of specialised industrial units for the
food industry. Construction will start by the end of November and the project
is due for completion by the summer.
The development, which received funding from the European Regional Development
Fund, has been widely welcomed by the food industry, and a major presentation
is being made to more than 100 representatives of Scottish food processing
companies today. Mr Jim Gilchrist, managing director of Foodsafe Properties,
which is developing the small units on the site, praised the way in which the
GDA had developed the site.
``We offer efficient modern buildings specifically designed for small producers
without the time and resources to build their own premises. The GDA exhibited a
unique understanding of the intricacies of land development, building grant
funding, and the food industry, allowing us to make available small units of
2000 sq ft to a market which needs nurturing.''
Robert Morris of P &amp; C Morris said the M8 Foodpark was ``a major property
incentive to help the food industry right here in Glasgow''. He also praised
the GDA for ``steering the project successfully from inception, design and
tendering through to business development assistance''.
Currently Glasgow has 600 firms working in the food sector, employing around
10,000 people. The new foodpark will enable them to capitalise on market
opportunities in the UK and increase their export capabilities.
Glasgow currently suffers from a shortage of good quality industrial land,
while stringent European Union regulations mean that a number of food
processing companies have had to upgrade their standards to meet European
Directives.
Units on the foodpark are being built to current European Commission
regulations covering food premises and are the first of their type to be built
for sale or rent on the open market.
The M8 Foodpark was originally a joint development between the GDA and Glasgow
City Council. The GDA has now acquired the six acres of land owned by the city
council, plus an adjacent six acres of land from British Rail. This land makes
up the first phase of the development.
The M8 Foodpark is very much a key component of GDA's Strategic Business and
Industrial Sites Programme, and as such is being given a very high priority.
As well as bringing important economic benefits to the city, the creation of
the foodpark has substantially improved the environment in an area of the city
which was formerly derelict. The GDA has a number ofprojects in the Port Dundas
area, which will have a significant environmental impact.
In 1991 the GDA commissioned a detailed marketing and development review of
companies operating in Glasgow's food sector, with the aim of identifying
current and future pressures on the food processing business. It was recognised
that the food industry played a vital role in Glasgow's economy and was
undergoing a period of major change. It was further realised that without some
form of assistance, many companies were going to find themselves in difficulty.
This resulted in the business development issues being addressed in Food For
Profit - the Glasgow Integrated Food Programme, which offers advice and
assistance to Glasgow-based food producers or processors.
A number of property-related issues emerged from the report. These indicated
that new food safety regulations would have an impact on most companies, while
the majority of small and medium-sized businesses were in premises that would
inhibit both their future survival and expansion. It also emerged that 30% to
40% of companies were considering relocation.
To deal with this situation it was recommended that a number of foodparks be
developed. These would accommodate 650,000 sq ft of food safe premises in units
ranging from 2500 to 25,000 sq ft. It was further recommended that serviced
sites capable of accommodating 20,000 sq ft units be provided.
The report identified a number of sites, and the GDA decided to develop both
the M8 Foodpark and the Glasgow East Foodpark in Cambuslang Investment Park.

THE 12-acre M8 Foodpark at Port Dundas offers 140,000 sq ft of purpose-built
industrial units to one of Glasgow's major economic sectors - the food
processing industry. The site, which is being promoted by the Glasgow
Development Agency, is ideally located, offering easy access to the centre of
Glasgow and the motorway system.
In common with companies throughout the food processing industry, Glasgow-based
companies must improve their operational environment if they wish to compete in
an increasingly hygiene-conscious market. However, a major obstacle to many
food companies in Glasgow wanting to increase their market share by improving
quality has been the lack of suitable premises within the city.
To comply with European Commission regulations on food production, companies
must meet high standards of production quality. Under EC directives, local
authorities are responsible for ensuring these standards are met. At the same
time, major food retailers and consumers have become increasingly conscious of
health and hygiene issues, demanding the highest standards of quality and
cleanliness from food processors, many of whom have difficulty affording the
improvements of premises required.
The M8 Foodpark offers food producers the double bonus of high quality premises
and a first-rate support package to assist with relocation and business
development. Both serviced plots and purpose-built accommodation - for sale or
lease - are available. The accommodation is ideal for companies needing to
expand. It is specifically designed to meet EC Directive 91/497/EEC (92/5 and
95/1) and the Food Safety Act (1990) regulating hygiene, food handling,
processing storage, product materials and ease of inspection.
Unit sizes range from 2000 to 25,000 sq ft, depending on individual company
requirements. Set in an attractive landscaped environment, all units will be
finished with structural steel portals, incorporating a mezzanine floor, a
stainless steel staircase to mezzanine offices, a ceramic-tiled entrance hall,
a white-bonded panelled roof and external walls, double-glazed windows
throughout, and up-and-over bay doors.
There will also be adequate parking and yard space, along with 24-hour
security, incorporating closed-circuit television. As well as meeting their
property needs, the GDA offers food producers a wide range of support services.
These include an assessment of property requirements. Food sector specialist
surveyors can carry out a feasibility study of property requirements, looking
at property needs, size of premises, site selection and analysing costs.
Help is also offered with architectural planning. Initially advice is given
free on how a food production business can operate from the M8 Foodpark.
In addition, the GDA can offer assistance with funding. Specialist accountants
are available to help prepare financial plans and source grants available to
food sector companies in Glasgow. Such grants would include Regional Selective
Assistance grants, which include contributions towards property costs where
necessary.
Plots or accommodation on the M8 Foodpark are offered for sale or let on the
most attractive terms. These will be discussed on an individual company basis,
to suit individual company requirements.

YOUR broken leg is less painful to me than my sore toe. So who's to say you
should get priority when the only aspirin is dished out? The arguments over
what constitutes rationing in health care become more bamboozling by the day.
In the words of the old song, you say tomayto and I say tomahto: you say
rationing, I say prioritising. Do they both mean the same thing, really?
But just say the word ``rationing'' in political circles and watch people
scurry for cover. It smacks of brutal decisions about whether your 27-week
premature baby should be kept alive in intensive care at the expense of hip
replacements for rosy-cheeked grannies.
Medical professionals insist there has always been rationing in the health
service. Queues for treatment, waiting-lists, a quiet shaking of the head over
the chances of your elderly mum getting hooked up to kidney dialysis. It is the
public debate on rationing which is new, they argue.
Politicians like to pretend that all decisions made by doctors are purely
clinical. Are they? Is it really that simple? What of the leukemia girl, Child
B, doomed to die when the costs for her treatment were refused by the
purchasing health authority but who remains alive because private money was
found to pay the expensive costs?
It emerged last week that one in three health authorities has started explicit
rationing of certain treatments. The first comprehensive survey of health care
under the NHS market showed that 40 of the 129 health authorities in Scotland,
England and Wales were either buying no care under one or more treatment
headings or are limiting it.
Those treatments currently taken off the shopping-list of the 40 health
authorities include cosmetic plastic surgery, fertility treatment, ear grommets
and homeopathy. But they also covered preventive services such as routine
ultrasound in pregnancy, screening for brittle-bone disease and some cancers.
Were they rationing, then, or merely prioritising? And how can we, mere
patients, tell the difference?
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell says he wants to improve patient care by
identifying the best treatments faster and weeding out those that have no place
in the modern health service. The fashion now is for evidence-based medicine.
Such as: If a doctor suggests you have your tonsils out, does he have the
research evidence to prove that is the most effective treatment for your sore
throat? Or is he basing his diagnosis on past experience and what he feels to
be right? Wouldn't a course of antibiotics do the job? Or is that simply the
cheaper option?
Yesterday, the director of the National Association of Health Authorities and
Trusts, Philip Hunt, chucked his tuppence worth into the debate by insisting
that cutting out ``unnecessary'' operations would throw a financial lifeline to
the NHS, as well as winning public support.
The head of the body which represents a large number of health providers said
such a move would prevent the need to ration access to effective treatments now
or in the future.
Mr Hunt was speaking at a conference on the rationing debate in London,
organised by the Institute of Public Policy Research.
So what is an unnecessary operation?
The Government says the health purchasers are merely taking the sensible step
of targeting real need while attaching low priority to the least-effective
treatments.
Labour says it is rationing, and claims health care is being turned into a
lottery with your chances of scoring the jackpot in surgery dependent on where
you live.
Mr Hunt, though, is arguing that there is another strand to be considered. He
claims that excluding 5% of surgical procedures - a conservative estimate of
the proportion of ``unnecessary'' treatments - will generate large sums and
solve many existing financial problems.
He is calling for more-judicious use of specialist experts to provide
better-value care. In Glasgow, he points out, directing breast cancer patients
to the six surgeons with the best record for treating the disease resulted in
survival rates improving by 10%. Also in Glasgow, it had been found that the
survival rate of patients with ovarian cancer was 35% when treated by
gynaecologists, compared with 13% when treated by general surgeons.
Specialist treatment was found to be cheaper per patient. Mr Hunt told the
conference that applying ``effectiveness'' criteria to the purchase of NHS care
would reduce the price of some services substantially: ``Collectively the
ensuing savings, if redeployed, would be more than sufficient to eliminate any
need to ration access to effective clinical care now, or in the foreseeable
future.'' And might conceivably save your life.
Bewitched by the figures, bothered by the intense focus on costs, bewildered
about what to do if you live in Stromness and there isn't a breast cancer
specialist handy? So what do you do? Whom do you believe?
Let's ask a doctor. Neurosurgeon turned politician Dr Sam Galbraith is noted
for plain-speaking. ``Start with the fundamentals. You have to distinguish
between demand and need. The two are entirely different. There is unlimited
demand on the NHS but no unlimited need.''
His theme is that when you trot along to your GP demanding antibiotics to treat
your child's cough he might decide they are not needed. The pills are not
effective for viral infections.
The definition of rationing is confused and questionable, he says: ``Stopping
unnecessary treatments is not rationing. Rationing is the denial of treatment
that is of benefit to me, that I want and the doctor wants to give me. Nothing
else is rationing.''
At yesterday's conference, another speaker, Anna Coote, the institute's deputy
director, said hard choices could no longer be ducked: ``What's needed is a
strong, clear framework for decision-making to guide clinicians and managers.''
And patients? Where do they fit in? Perhaps, in the words of another song, only
money talks.

JOCKEY Dean Gallagher is ready to take the mount on Couldnt Be Better in the
Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup on Saturday, but a different rider for the favourite,
One Man, has still to be chosen.
Subject to confirmation by the owners, Gallagher will deputise at Newbury for
Adrian Maguire, sidelined until December after having been injured at Ascot at
the weekend.
Richard Dunwoody is favourite to replace Tony Dobbin on One Man, Dobbin having
broken a bone in a hand at Catterick.
But the champion is at present committed to partner Merry Gale at Punchestown.
``As far as I know I will be riding Couldnt Be Better, though I know Charlie
Brooks hasn't been able to speak to the owners to confirm it yet,'' said
Gallagher.
Couldnt Be Better, an 8-1 chance, put himself on target for the Newbury race
with a sparkling comeback victory at Haydock last week. ``I've never ridden the
horse on the course but I know him well as I've schooled him at home,'' said
Gallagher.
``I looking forward to riding him. He has won over three miles but there has to
be a slight question mark over the longer distance. He's got a nice weight with
10st 4lbs and I think he goes there with a great chance.''
Dunwoody has ridden several winners for One Man's trainer Gordon Richards this
season but he insisted he was unlikely to ride the favourite. ``I've given my
word to Jim Dreaper that I would be riding Merry Gale and it looks as if I'm
going to Punchestown,'' he said. ``But I haven't spoken to Jim and I have to
speak to Gordon as well.''
The main betting moves yesterday surrounded Couldnt Be Better's stablemate
Black Humour, cut to 12-1 (from 16s) and Terry Casey's Rough Quest, snipped
from 7-1 to 6s.
One Man has eased from his 6-4 favourite to 13-8, with a spokesman for one
leading firm of bookmakers saying: ``People have been looking for an
alternative to One Man, especially with doubts about who will ride. The horse
everyone seems to have latched on to is Rough Quest.''
q TRYING Again can launch his chasing career with a win in the Tipperary Chase
at Chepstow today.
Trainer David Gandolfo has a high opinion of the seven-year-old, regarded as a
leading Arkle Chase candidate - before he has jumped a fence in public. Trying
Again was a smart hurdler, runner-up in the Kingwell Hurdle and Tote Gold
Trophy last term.
Both his size and his fluent jumping suggest he'll take to fences and it would
be no surprise to see his fulfilling his trainer's highest hopes.

TRAVADO took the honours in a thrilling race for the Peterborough Chase at
Huntingdon yesterday.
The race lived up to expectations with Travado, Martha's Son, and Coulton all
in with a chance close home. But Richard Dunwoody's mount did just enough to
fend off Martha's Son after Coulton had fallen at the last.
``It was a treat to see three top horses like that and it's wonderful when
races like this come together,'' said Travado's trainer Nicky Henderson.
``He's had quite a hard race and we might put him away until Cheltenham.''
Martha's Son was not helped by an error at the second last when making his move
for home.

<TEXT>
TOTAL losses at Lloyd's of London are set to rise to #11.4bn by next year,
according to a report sent yesterday to the insurance market's backers known as
Names.
``By next spring the total losses declared at Names level since 1988 will
amount to #11.4bn,'' said the report, compiled by a committee set up to advise
Lloyd's on the fairest division of any compensation to be awarded to Names for
losses.
This is the first estimate of the likely total deficit incurred in the worst
chapter of the 300-year-old market, which began in the late 1980s when Lloyd's
plunged into record losses after a series of natural and industrial disasters.
Since then Lloyd's has also been burdened by a wave of pollution and asbestosis
related claims from the United States.
As more and more bad news has poured out of the market - including last week
the surprise resignation of Lloyd's chief executive Peter Middleton - many
Names have taken legal action to recoup some of their losses.

<TEXT>
Vienna, Tuesday - Opec met in the Austrian capital today and is close to an
accord on a new output freeze to defend oil prices, but the organisation vented
anger at how prices are depressed by excess supplies from outside the cartel
and its own quota violators.
The outgoing president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Erwin Arrieta of Venezuela, said in a speech that uncontrolled
output outside Opec had raised the ``potential risk of . . . a dangerous price
war''.
But Opec did not seem ready to turn up the taps, flood markets and try to
coerce non-members like Britain and Norway to curb output - as it vainly did
when it engineered a pricing collapse in the 1980s.
Conference delegates said the 11 participating oil ministers led by Saudi
Arabia were instead virtually agreed to freeze current Opec output quotas for
six or 12 months from January 1.
They would then consider in discussions that resume tomorrow how to discipline
the quota violators, alleged to be led by Venezuela. ``It's a problem of
collective discipline,'' said Amar Makhloufi who succeeded the Venezuelan
Minister in the rotating Opec presidency. - Reuter

THE Labour leaders of the new City of Edinburgh Council yesterday made
significant concessions over the payment of special responsibility allowances
to opposition Tory and Liberal Democrat councillors.
However, they are to be reported to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth over
their plans for the composition of a number of joint boards.
The effect of Labour's concession on SRAs is that all 24 Tories and Liberal
Democrats will now receive the additional payments.
Labour leader Councillor Keith Geddes said they had responded to remarks by
Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch, who had said SRAs should be
paid to opposition councillors.
Under the new arrangements, the 14 Tory spokesmen and women will all receive
one SRA of #3825 on top of the council's basic allowance of #6000. The 10
Liberal Democrats get an additional #2550.
Previously only two SRAs each were paid to the Tories and the Liberal Democrats.
Ruling groups on the new councils however have been under growing pressure from
the Scottish Office and the Labour Party hierarchy to treat opposition groups
fairly.
Councillor Geddes, who gets a payment of #17,000, said Edinburgh's average SRA
payment was about #12,000 - the same as the Scottish average.
A row started at the full meeting of the council over Labour's proposals for
membership of the joint police, fire, and valuation boards.
Liberal Democrats accused Labour of ``blatant distortion'' over their plan to
have six Labour members, two Tories, and one Liberal Democrat from Edinburgh on
the boards.
They unsuccessfully demanded the membership should be 5:2:2 and claimed Labour
members were insisting on so many members because they were afraid their
colleagues in Mid, West, and East Lothian might not back their nominees for
conveners of the boards.

THE considerable turmoil which has blighted the postal industry in Scotland
over the past 12 months shows no sign of abating with yesterday's escalation of
the unofficial strike action taken by staff at a local delivery office in
Edinburgh.
With last month's reported threat of disruption to festive deliveries, it has
been and continues to be a difficult year all round for the Royal Mail, workers
and customers.
Management-union disagreements have been rife since a strike by staff last
Christmas over claims of ``back-door privatisation'' by the Royal Mail.
In the interim, the Scottish public experienced a further one-day strike on the
privatisation issue but, more seriously, endured a lengthy and bitter stoppage.
This arose from a protest against a management decision to scrap the
traditional May Day holiday and continued as anger erupted over working
practices to deal with the backlog. It was a dispute that landed in the highest
court with the Post Office seeking an injunction claiming it wanted services
for its customers protected and claiming the union had no mandate to call the
strike.
Trade union officials labelled the court action ``a desperate response'' to the
campaign against ``back-door privatisation''.
It was also a protracted confrontation which saw Scotland's business community,
starved of deliveries, warn of potential danger to their operations should the
situation continue much longer.
At the time, Scottish staff employed in all six Post Office businesses endorsed
strike action, with Royal Mail employees leading the way with an impressive 7-1
vote in a turnout of almost 90%. The Communications Workers Union accused the
Post Office and particularly the Royal Mail of once again misjudging the mood
of the staff by taking cavalier unilateral decisions on their terms and
conditions.
The Post Office maintained its decision to axe the May Day holiday was in order
to extend the May 8 VE-Day bank holiday to Scotland. It said it was a one-off
arrangement with next year's May Day holiday being restored and the proposed
strike was unnecessary and pointless as Scottish employees would receive the
same holiday entitlement as staff throughout England and Wales.
This failed to sway postal staff and an unofficial dispute saw a massive
backlog of deliveries build up across the country with Edinburgh, the Lothians,
Fife, and Glasgow among areas badly affected.
The striking workers, after several days and a number of meetings, voted to
return, with union officials maintaining the disruption to services had been
caused by Royal Mail management.
At the time, Mr John Keggie, a member of the national executive of the CWU and
divisional officer for Scotland and Norther Ireland, said his members, who had
twice defied union pleas to go back to work, were returning with dignity.
He said an agreement had been secured where his members felt sure their terms
and conditions would be protected and he said they had shown the Royal Mail
management if it contemplated attacking the second delivery service in Scotland
it could face the same hostility in future.
Last month postal workers figured again in the headlines by declaring further
opposition to Royal Mail plans to reduce second deliveries.
The CWU has protested a proposal to axe 300 full-time jobs in Scotland and
Northen Ireland, and arrangements are being carried out for a ballot on
industrial action, which if approved could take place before Christmas.
The Royal Mail's position, not unnaturally, is that the blame for what has gone
on recently lies ``fairly and squarely'' with the other side, in particular the
CWU in Scotland.
It states: ``There is a lack of recognition that the business has to change to
meet the demands of the customers. The key thing is that we are doing it
against a background of changes in the Royal Mail which are necessary.''
However, Mr George Robertson, chairman of the Glasgow branch of the CWU and
divisional officer, blamed the unrest on management style.
``We get complaints day in and day out of bullying, threats and intimidation to
clear and take as much mail as possible in the first delivery.''
The short-term future for the industry when it comes to relations between
management and union looks bleak.
Workers in Edinburgh are angry and have walked out in support of Portobello
colleagues over the Royal Mail's introduction of new working practices earlier
this week. Last night, the strike had escalated and the threat of it spreading
throughout Scotland became real.
There is anger locally in Lanarkshire over the second deliveries issue.
Indefinite strike action is planned by postal staff in Hamilton from Friday.
The hostility John Keggie forecast back in May has broken out. The last thing
on disgruntled workers' minds only weeks before the festive celebrations would
appear to be peace and goodwill.

A LEADING supermarket chain yesterday invited mothers to breastfeed their
babies in its stores.
Sainsbury's staff have been told to help breastfeeding mothers by showing them
to ``a quiet corner of the restaurant'' if requested.
Restaurant customers who object to a baby being breastfed near them will be
offered another table. Staff have been instructed not to uproot the mother and
child.
Sainsbury's said its breastfeeding policy was the first of its kind from a UK
food retailer.
The Government welcomed the idea.
The move follows a recommendation by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food,
a Government advisory body, that ``breast milk provides the best source of
nourishment for the early months of life''.

SCOTLAND'S top shinty club have been given a valuable piece of land for a pound
by its local district council.
Premier Division leaders Kingussie have been offered the prime site location to
build a new #150,000 clubhouse.
Badenoch and Strathspey district councillors agreed unanimously to hand over
the land after council officials got the go-ahead from the Scottish Secretary.
The council-owned land at the town's Market Stance had been valued at #5000.
It is the second financial boost for the club as they have been awarded #55,000
from the National Lottery to help them fund the clubhouse project.
That money is dependent on them raising 25% of the building costs themselves.
The club are also applying to the Foundation of Sport and the Arts for a grant.
Mr Donnie Grant, a spokesman for the club, said: ``It makes our fund-raising
drive that wee bit easier but there is still a long way to go.''
Kingussie have been dubbed the Rangers of shinty after dominating the North
League for more than a decade and are now sitting top of the national Premier
League.

CLUTCHING a small, framed scroll, official recognition of Glasgow's new status
as Scotland's only National City of Sport, Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall
innocently sought suggestions yesterday about a suitable place to hang it.
``Just inside the Lothian Region boundary,'' came the acid reply.
Mischievous or not, it underlines that Glasgow has stolen a lead as a UK
front-runner in the race to host regional, national, and world sporting events,
with all the economic benefits, and handicapping rivals.
Many future attractions, such as the World Badminton Championships, were
already common knowledge, but the unveiling of previously unknown events
demonstrates serious new ambitions.
Among a list of confirmed fixtures is a Scotland A rugby international against
Australia at Scotstoun next season. The intention to build an 8000-capacity
stand and the ability to extend that temporarily to 30,000 at minimal cost will
establish Glasgow as a candidate for 1999 Rugby World Cup matches.
International events secured by Glasgow from 1996-98 also include:
International Masters and world grand prix swimming, Commonwealth Table Tennis
Championships, European Indoor Women's Hockey Championships, European and world
boxing events, European junior swimming and diving championships, and
international showjumping, cycling, karate, athletics, and gymnastics.
The Herald last week revealed bids for the European cross-country and world
road relay championships. Confirming these, the city's director of Parks and
Recreation, Bernard Connolly, said applications for further major swimming,
hockey, and badminton events are also in the pipeline.
Chances of securing these are significantly increased by yesterday's
announcement, which was celebrated with a civic reception and acknowledgment of
messages of congratulations from John Major and sports personalities, including
Craig Brown, Alex Ferguson, Frank Bruno and Lennox Lewis.
Becoming only the third UK city so honoured, after Sheffield and Birmingham,
increases Glasgow's prospects of pitching successfully for major events.
The accolade, conferred jointly by the sports councils of Great Britain and
Scotland, and lasting for five years, recognises the city's role in developing
and promoting sport effectively. Fewer than 10 UK cities will be considered in
the next two years.
Rodney Walker, chairman of the Great Britain Sports Council, said: ``It is not
our aim to constrain cities which would bid for major events, but we recognise
the need for a system which ensures value for money and a long-term commitment
to sport.''
However, the UK sports commission, an arm of the sports councils which advises
cities on how to bid for events, and without whose backing such bids are
unlikely to succeed, will inevitably favour cities with this new seal of
approval. ``Our aim is to ensure effective utilisation of resources,'' added
Walker. ``It is essential that cities do not compete directly against one
another for events.''
Graeme Simmers, chairman of the Scottish Sports Council, spoke of the recently
revealed vision of a Scottish Academy of Sport, involving the provision of
centres of excellence: ``Undoubtedly, several of these will be in Glasgow
itself.''

<HEADLINE>Non-EU trade deficit leaps to #1192m</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with countries outside the European Union worsened
sharply in October, rising to #1192m compared to September's #696m, its highest
monthly figure on record.
Not for the first time markets were completely wrongfooted with forecasters
expecting a gap of around #800m. The deficit, described by President of the
Board of Trade Ian Lang as ``a bit disappointing,'' cannot all be blamed on
movements in erratic items such as ships, aircraft, and precious stones, and on
oil which had a surprise deficit of #66m despite the end of summer maintenance
in the North Sea.
Even excluding these, the gap widened from #681m to #951m although the figures
were pretty well ignored by financial markets.
During the month, the value of total exports fell 7% from #5686m to #5301m
while imports climbed 1.5% from #6382m to #6493m. September had benefited from
a surge in exports to the US but in October these fell back from #1885m to
#1657m. With imports up from #2064m to #2129m the gap with North America
widened from #179m to #472m so that September now looks to have been just a one
off.
This is particularly disappointing because the September performance had been
taken to indicate that exporters were benefiting from the pick-up in the US
economy. However, one month's figures taken in isolation must be treated with
caution.
In the three months to October, the deficit was #2878m compared with #2243m in
the preceding three months, of which around #400m was accounted for by erratic
items. The CSO said the latest estimate of trend suggests a widening in the
deficit.
The Treasury emphasised that the trend in exports is still upwards. And Mr Lang
said that the trade figures have to be seen against the background of
substantial progress over the last year. He said increased imports, which also
affect the picture, contain a large number of semi-manufactured goods.
``These are goods which will be finished in this country and then either
consumed here or re-exported, so they are part of the progress of trade,'' he
explained.
In terms of volume, exports fell by 3.5% over the month compared with September
excluding oil and erratics while the volume of imports rose by 1% to a record
level. The latest estimates of trends in volume, again excluding oil and
erratics, show imports have been rising faster than exports. During the three
months to October the volume of exports rose by 3% and imports by 4.5%.

A UNIVERSITY student is set to boldly go where no student has gone before - and
learn the Klingon language for her degree.
Star Trek fan Anita Karr, 32, is delving into the alien tongue used by Captain
Kirk's enemies in a bid to gain a BA in applied languages.
Miss Karr, president of Portsmouth University's Sci-Fi Club, is the first
student to learn Klingon and write a dissertation on it for a degree.
The conversation of Klingon aliens is spoken by Star Trek fans around the
world. There are dictionaries and phrase books available and people communicate
in Klingon on the Internet.
Miss Karr, who is studying French, Italian, and linguistics, keeps hundreds of
episodes of Star Trek on video at her home in Southsea, Hampshire.
She said: ``I will need to learn Klingon for my dissertation. The language is
based on Russian and was developed by American Mark Okrand. They gradually
added bits to it as it was needed in the series.
``It is growing and growing - every year they bring out new words and phrases.''
She added: ``There is a lot of dispute among linguists about whether it is a
real language. The Bible is being translated into Klingon.''
The sci-fi club has nearly 50 members and will start classes in Klingon next
year.
``We get into some very serious conversations,'' said Miss Karr.
``A lot of people are interested in how real Star Trek could be and discuss
things like how far you could take warp drive.''
Among Klingon phrases are:
q Iwlji jachjaj - May your blood scream (the Klingon equivalent to ``Cheers!'').
q blmoHqu' - You are ugly.
q bljeghbe'chugh vaj blHej - Surrender or die.
q nuqDaq yuch Dapol - Where do you keep the chocolate?

BRITAIN'S largest manufacturing union has launched a campaign to create 10,000
new apprenticeships over the next two years to stem the ``alarming'' fall in
the number of young trainees.
The Amalgamated, Engineering, and Electrical Union will try to persuade 5000
manufacturing companies with at least 100 employees to take on two or more
apprentices.
At the launch in London yesterday, acting general secretary Ken Jackson
described the 66% cut in the number of apprentices over the past 15 years as a
``horror story'' and stressed there was a very real danger of Britain becoming
a ``nation of hairdressers''.
Companies including Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace and the privatised
utilities would be key targets during the campaign.

WHYTE &amp; Mackay is the latest Scotch whisky distiller to venture into the
potentially lucrative Indian market since it opened up to imports last year.
The Scottish subsidiary of American Brands has signed a joint-venture agreement
with Radico Khaitan, a prominent Indian distiller and bottler, to market and
distribute a wide variety of Scotch whiskies in India.
Whyte &amp; Mackay owns 51% of the joint-venture company, which will start selling
a range of premium blend whiskies in India next year. The brands to be marketed
have not yet been announced.
Whyte &amp; Mackay will export Scotch in bulk for bottling in India. It will
compete with locally distilled whiskies which currently account for 60% of the
Indian spirits market, estimated at 50 million cases a year.
``We recognise the enormous potential for sales of premium Scotch whisky in
India and the establishment of this joint venture company demonstrates our
confidence in and long-term commitment to this market and its importance to our
global plans,'' said Whyte &amp; Mackay chief executive Ken Hitchcock.
To begin with, Whyte &amp; Mackay, like other Scotch whisky companies, will only be
able to nibble at the edges of the potentially vast Indian market.
Importers may only bring in 30,000 cases of Scotch during their first year of
operation, a quota which rises gradually to 75,000 after five years.
They must also export Indian drinks to the same value so that there is no net
loss of foreign exchange.
However, the Scotch whisky industry is lobbying the Indian Government hard to
get these quotas increased.
GrandMet was the first Scotch whisky distiller to enter the Indian market with
a joint venture in September last year.
It was followed a month later by Allied Distillers, which claims its Teachers
Highland Cream blend is the market leader.

<HEADLINE>Disagreement over price of expanding European Union CAP may cost extra 40bn Ecus a year</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR ROBERTSON</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>24</PAGE>

WIDELY differing estimates of the cost of expanding the European Union to
include central and eastern European countries (CEECs) may be reconciled in a
paper due shortly from the European Commission.
It is likely the commission will aim this at the lowest level possible to avoid
threatening itself and everyone else involved, according to Professor Allan
Buckwell, director of the Centre for European Agricultural Studies at Wye
College.
Estimates of the additional cost of funding the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) to cover expansion range from 4000m to 40bn Ecus a year. Professor
Buckwell, who is on secondment to the agricultural directorate of the
commission as part of a CAP think-tank, said this range arose from different
assumptions made.
``Some people seriously doubt that there is the political will for the
taxpayers of the EU-15 to put their hands in their pockets and increase the
budgetary resources to transfer to the CEECs to enable this enlargement. That
is ultimately a political matter.
``It is one of these matters where the taxpayers have not caught up with what
has been decided on their behalf. The decision has already been taken on
political and security grounds as well as on broader economic hopes.''
But there was no attempt made to add up the costs before this decision was
made, Professor Buckwell told a Wye College briefing in London. ``It seems to
me that whatever this cost is we will have to find ways to keep it down and we
will have to shrug our shoulders and pay it.''
Outlining the scale of the problem, he pointed out that the 10 countries
waiting in the wings would add nearly 30% more population to the EU, double the
number involved in agriculture and add 50% to the agricultural area. These
countries were also just getting over the shock of massive political and
economic change.
They would create huge problems including competition in the internal EU market
and producers in the 10 would have to get used to this.
But the timetable for joining was being pushed back, giving support to the
notion that there was little need to do anything to the CAP. ``Given the
decision making institutions in the Union, if one had to predict, then that's
probably the approach that may be taken,'' Professor Buckwell said.
There were other measures that could be taken, such as a ``pick and mix''
approach to which aspects of the CAP would be applied to the CEECs; entry could
be phased for different countries, or long transition periods applied. However,
the developing opinion was that the CAP would have to change to deal with the
problems, he said.
This had been shown in the shift from the no-change position of former farm
commissioner Rene Steichen to that of his successor Franz Fischler, who is
giving the impression that he recognises the balance between market, regional,
environmental and social support is not ideal and that the CAP reform process
should continue with a greater financial allocation to the last three.

UNDOUBTEDLY the granddaddy of charity art events, the Macmillan Cancer
Christmas Sale has already sold more than 300 of its 700 pictures and
sculptures, raising a total of over #30,000. However, many good things still
fill the walls of Washington Street. Famous folk like Elizabeth Blackadder,
Sandy Gardner, Glen Scouller and John Houston - a stunning Gullane sunburst,
cheap at #600 - hang beside bargains costing as little as #30.
Good low-budget pictures include lovely flowers like 50 Lilies by Anderson
Veith. There's also Dunn's Cullipool Cottages for #80, while Sandy Goudie and
Lin Pattullo have both donated pictures for the raffle.
The Macmillan exhibition reflects a heartening seasonal trend. Stirling's Smith
Gallery show in aid of the Prince's Trust sold 33 pictures, raising #10,000,
while Glasgow Print Studio's Red Ribbon AIDS fundraising auction sold 53 out of
55 works.
Next is an exhibition for Direct       Aid to Bosnia, showing first at
Garner's Parnie Street Glasgow Gallery, then TSB Head office,
Edinburgh, prior to auction on December 15.

IT IS sad but true: Michael Howard cannot actually be deported for being the
most effortlessly offensive Home Secretary in recent memory, even if the Judges
who have been obliged more than once to remind him of the laws of the land
might wish it otherwise. Legal difficulties aside, who would have him?
Howard's attitude to asylum seekers - where would Michael Portillo's Spanish
Republican father have been, might we guess, with this QC in the Home Office? -
has become emblematic of his Government's attitude to all things alien.
Howard it is who provides the scapegoats for the Tory conference; he is the
smirking MC, undaunted by questions of taste, for the racist cabaret. If there
is a prejudice to be fed or a myth to be fostered, Michael's your boy.
Thus Britain's asylum problem - we are being ``swamped'', it seems, by 75,000
people who claim to fear for their lives - becomes in his hands a party
political problem, a matter of securing votes. And as we know, when in
electoral difficulties the Tories kick a foreigner.
That said, the Immigration and Asylum Bill is perhaps the cheapest shot yet.
The tradition of the liberal democracies has been to err on the side of caution
when considering appeals for asylum. Get it wrong, after all, and someone loses
their life.
Besides, the notion of democracies as beacons for the oppressed of the world
had as its living symbol the individuals given refuge from tyranny. Once upon a
time deeds were worth more than words. Today, we see a determined effort to
ensure that our lavish benefits system, the one that keeps so many of our own
people in shameless luxury, is to be denied to foreigners who cannot actually
prove they are about to be murdered.
Howard also proposes, meanwhile, that employers should become police spies,
persuaded by draconian laws to report illegal immigrants.
Then there is the ``white list'' (such a subtle name) now being drawn up of
countries whose citizens will stand next to no chance of securing asylum on the
grounds that their governments are deemed ``too stable'' and agreeable ever to
oppress anyone.
That such a proposal should come from the people who have has just blocked a
European arms embargo against Nigeria ought to be the stuff of satire, but
who's laughing? Nazi Germany was wonderfully stable for years, and much admired
by the more rigorous sort of Tory. Communist China boasts many fine
concentration camps while remaining one of our valued trading partners.
Is it seriously proposed, in other words, that this international league of
decency is to be compiled by the party that is still trying to explain why it
encouraged the sale of arms to Iraq? Are the old suppliers of Pinochet's junta
claiming seriously that they will publish a list of countries which are not
filthy, murderous dictatorships and identify, by omission, those which are?
What might that do to our valuable defence industries?
In reality, of course, the white list will be a black list. Rich whites
emanating from countries that are not actually war zones, such as Bosnia, will
find their paths smoothed. Blacks and Asians will continue to be harassed at
airports and banged up without legal remedy in detention centres. Count on it.
Given that there are no new ideas on the right, it is not surprising to learn
that wheezes similar to those propounded by Howard have been floated elsewhere.
In France, deportation flights are now commonplace. In California,
``Proposition 187'' would require government workers, teachers, and police to
report all suspected illegal immigrants to federal officials.
This chimes nicely with those Republicans - some of whose very best friends are
Hispanic - who have been demanding that English should become America's
official language. Again, the fear of the alien becomes an excuse for patriotic
rabble-rousing. Dark-skinned people are drawn to the `honeypot'' (Howard's
word) of the West and opportunist politicians seek to criminalise them simply
for trying to improve their lives.
In a lawsuit heard on Monday, however, opponents of Proposition 187 claimed it
would require untrained public employees to make ``arbitrary decisions'' about
an individual's status based on such factors as skin colour, accent, or fluency
in English. A federal Judge agreed, and ruled that the main parts of the
proposition are unconstitutional.
That couldn't happen here, of course, a fact which may tell us more than we
would like to know about the superbly democratic system Michael Howard is
working so hard to uphold.

Berwick Rangers 0,
Queen of the South 0
WITH only two points out of the last 12, Berwick Rangers are beginning to
falter in the promotion race.
A draw was a fair result in a game which became worse and worse as it
progressed. Both sides were guilty of misplaced passes and both were totally
inept at close range.
Goalkeeper Neil Young twice rescued Rangers with good saves from the lively
Tommy Bryce, while Berwick came close, too, with a Graeme Fraser header, and a
low drive from Alan Banks which was well smothered by Jim Butter.
Berwick's injury cases mounted when Mark Wilson was carried off in the first
half to be replaced by Paul Forrester.
It upset the rhythm of the side and Queens, though lacking power up front,
always looked the better side with their quick breaks from defence.
Three players were booked, Mark Cowan of Berwick, for a foul on David Kennedy,
David Lilley of Queens for dissent, and team-mate John McLaren, for a high
tackle on Young.
All the best players were defenders, and the fans became frustrated by
Berwick's safety-first tactics.

IT can never be easy to formulate Budget proposals, but the persistence of the
``feel bad'' factor and his party's apparent inability to impact their position
in the opinion polls present the Chancellor with a particularly acute dilemma:
to stick to his guns and maintain his existing policy line, or to loosen off
the reins a little, and let the economy breathe.
Kenneth Clarke may be justified in feeling a little aggrieved to find himself
in this position with many of the economic measures at levels which some of his
predecessors could only have dreamt about.
However, there are recent indications that business confidence and output may
be slipping and of course many house owners across the country are not
particularly happy with their lot. I think he will feel compelled to deviate
from his strict policy line and make some overt gestures towards gently
stimulating the economy.
Much has been said about cuts in basic and higher rate taxes but with tax
revenues below planned levels and the PBSR not improving, tax cuts will be
expensive with their effect being difficult to predict. The feel bad factor may
simply cause people to hold on to the saving, rather than spending it, with the
result that there is no knock on benefit to the economy.
Instead of using such a blunt instrument, I would prefer to see the Chancellor
putting in place specific measures to address specific issues. As well as
having a more predictable outcome, such measures are likely to restore and even
increase the all important confidence factor.
Key areas for the Scottish and UK economies are the housing market and small
and medium-sized businesses where specific attention from the Chancellor would
produce fairly rapid results.
Despite the occasional glimmers of an upswing, the domestic property market in
Scotland remains resolutely flat. The causes of this could be debated at
length, but it is clear that the effect is impacting on a wide range of related
businesses, not to mention the mindset of home owners.
The reductions in Miras in recent years, abolition of unemployment relief,
together with the advent of negative equity have undermined the belief that
buying a home was a fail safe investment. I have heard suggestions that the
Chancellor should consider implementing some mechanisms to give tax relief to
those with negative equity, but I am strongly against this, not least because
it would do little to help Scotland, where the incidence of negative equity is
comparatively trivial.
However attractive a prospect it might seem, it is unrealistic to expect the
Chancellor to restore Miras to its former levels even on a temporary basis.
What seems more realistic would be some form of enhanced Miras relief for
first-time buyers. As well as being of direct assistance to such buyers, the
introduction of such a relief would be seen as a clear sign from the Chancellor
that there is still support for the notion of private home ownership.
There is clear evidence that a thriving first-time buyers' market is a critical
component for a buoyant house market in general.
Small and medium-sized businesses are such an important sector of the economy
for creating jobs and export business that I believe encouragement to invest in
upgrading systems and equipment is a necessity.
Many businesses in this sector have been wrestling with ever tightening margins
and unprecedented levels of competition. Many are struggling on hoping that
these pressures will ease, whereas in reality they will increase. For many
businesses, the only way forward is to invest in new equipment or processes to
ensure that their costs are as low as possible, to enable them to continue to
compete.
Interest rate cuts of course help. however, the interest rate mechanism does
not deliver the future stability the businessman needs. Just look at the speed
with which the interest rate outlook can change and how the public debate
between the Governor and the Bank of England fuels uncertainty. More direct and
immediate encouragement should I feel be given through tax incentives for
businesses prepared to invest in their infrastructure.
I am, therefore, looking for the Chancellor to relieve the beleagured home
owner and encourage small and medium-business and by so doing help stimulate
the economy at large.

AMID the current poking-about into the morals and mores of the tribunes of the
people, the troubled Renfrew District Council keeps the flag of PC flying by
appointing a Convener for Abuse and Criticism, one Mrs Nancy Allison, who is
paid #21,000 per year. She is married to Jimmy Allison, former organising
secretary of the Labour Party in Scotland, a man not unrenowned for his use of
colourful language, so plenty of practice there.
We are not certain whether Mrs Allison is there to take the abuse and criticism
or to dish it out but she has been the subject of both by councillor Paul Mack,
for whom justice deferred means no justice. His suspension from the official
ranks of the People's Party remains in force and has now been referred to the
national committee in London.
A Labour Party spokesman, asked when the case might be resolved, said:
``There's a queue of these things, hundreds of people involved.'' Of the
Convener for Abuse and Criticism, he said: ``This is definitely not in the
`best practice' guidelines.''
Mr Mack also has a colourful turn of phrase when it comes to describing the
all-woman panel who mooted his suspension, and likens his present situation to
``standing under Nelly the Elephant. There's crap coming at me from all
angles.''
Name Games
THIS is your final call for winning the wine on offer by Michael Dale for a new
name for the West End Festival. We have a suggestion from Jack Stewart, at the
risk of legislation, of West West West, and Ian Gordon has been on again with
How The West Was One. So far no fewer than five people have put forward the
idea that he just calls it Jimmy.
n THE new Dumbarton and Clydebank council has in front of it, as do we, a
report by the head of corporate policy and public relations on the subject of a
new name for the council. Almost 200 suggestions were received but the report
states that there was no clear winner among them. We quite liked Bonnie Banks,
though we didn't understand Alclutha and we were fairly disinterested in North
Clyde and West Dumbartonshire. We do, however, think that Dunbritton might sway
the electorate towards the Nationalists.
n STILL on the subject of councillors we have a variation on an old joke about
the difference between a Glasgow city councillor and a shopping trolley. Our
(anonymous by request) correspondent suggests that both have minds of their
own, but you can get a lot more booze into a councillor.

by a missive from their son, who had just started university in England. It was
the first letter they had received from him and was long, discursive, and
elegantly written, saying the place was great, he was settling in fine, etc.
Their joy was a trifle dampened several days later when they met another couple
who had a son at a different university in England, as they had received, with
the names changed, exactly the same letter.
Is the NUS issuing them as part of a kit, or is there some young
entrepreneurial hand at work?
Steppin' out
THE paucity of visits from the royal family to everyone's favourite
great-granny, the Queen Mum, might be a matter of the generation gap. She has
apparently taken to wearing clothes from Prada, the ultra-chic Milan fashion
house famous for its use of black nylon, while simultaneously donning her
favourite pair of Vans, the latest in designer deck shoes, listening to
Bristol's trip-hop music kings Portishead and saying ``Yeah, sorted,'' a lot.
You just don't get the same quality of hip replacement on the NHS.
In full feather
FROM reader Elspeth Craig, an example from South Africa of It's An Ill Wind,
concerning Britain's latest get-rich-but-maybe-not-as-quick-as-you-think wheeze
- ostrich farms. Her husband was touring Oudtshoorn where there are many of
these and popped into the local museum where he found a 1915 report from the
inspector of the Standard Bank bemoaning the depreciation in the price of
ostrich feathers and the consequent drop in the value of farm property.
His concluding paragraph reads: ``As to the future of the industry; who can
tell? The local breeders are fully convinced that after the war the high prices
of a few years ago will again be realised. Their chief argument being that when
hostilities cease there will be so many young widows requiring to attract fresh
husbands that a brisk demand for feathers will arise.''
Foul play?
A QUERY in from Jimeoin, the hilarious Northern Irish/Australian stand-up who
starts his Scottish tour at Glasgow's Old Athenaeum tomorrow and Friday. He
suspects bias and he would like to know why the shops aren't full of Power
Celtics.

SCOTTISH electronics manufacturers met Irish components suppliers in Glasgow
yesterday to try to forge a partnership between the two countries which have
often seen each other as rivals.
The Irish Trade Board sponsored the one-day conference on supply management to
make Scottish manufacturers more aware of the products and expertise available
in Ireland.
The electronics industry employes more than 30,000 people in Ireland and
generates exports of about IR#4000m (#3900m) each year. That figure represents
27% of total Irish exports.
Martin McCarthy, the Irish Trade Board's manager in Scotland, said although
Scotland and Ireland were often competitors for inward investment, it was
important to remember that roughly 80% of the components used in the Scottish
electronics industry were imported from overseas. ``I think sometimes people
think that if a new Irish supplier comes in, they're automatically replacing a
Scottish or another UK supplier, and that's not necessarily so,'' he said.
``That's probably not the case four out of five times.''
Douglas Macbeth, professor of supply chain management at the University of
Glasgow, spoke at the conference about reducing waste and improving the quality
of electronics products through supply management.
``All of these things get easier if your supplier is right around the corner,''
he said.
Mr Macbeth also said there was potential for Irish suppliers and Scottish
manufacturers to co-ordinate and develop together to improve competitiveness.
``As you go overseas, your supplier goes with you, and you both have more of a
chance to compete in world markets successfully,'' he said.
Dan Byrne, vice-president of manufacturing and logistics for Digital Europe,
agreed.
He said manufacturers lost out when they looked solely at the unit price of an
item and ignored the hidden costs in logistics or inventory holding.
By developing relationships with suppliers in Ireland, Scottish electronics
manufacturers could avoid those pitfalls, Mr Byrne added.
``Ireland and Scotland will continue to compete, I'm sure, for inward
investment,'' he said. ``But I still think there are opportunities here to
build the infrastructure in both countries to support the multinationals.''

THE Princess of Wales says: ``I'll fight to the end.'' But fight exactly what
for? It is not as if Prince Charles is about to cast her off without a penny
and, if he did, the Spencers could surely just about club together and keep her
going.
It is not as if she is denied access to her sons, which would be too monstrous
even for a royal family where personal affection normally counts for little.
She does not seek a divorce, but is prepared to go along with her husband's
wishes on that. She has no desire to be Queen, or at any rate thinks it
unlikely that she ever will be. So what precisely is the problem?
It seems to come down to her ``royal role''. Strange that this should worry her
when there is not a street in the world she could walk along without being
mobbed by a curious and perhaps adoring crowd. Certainly there are not
half-a-dozen other personalities who could snap their fingers and persuade the
BBC to let them pour out their souls at length on screen.
That is apparently not enough for her, though. No doubt she is used to not
being at the top of Buckingham Palace's list of favourite people. But, to her
own mind, she can still ``do good'', by going round to comfort the unfortunate,
and she can still be an ``ambassador for her country''.
Such activities are just the ones that the Prince of Wales is grimly determined
to keep her away from. They show her off to great advantage, and they cast his
own defects of diffidence and selfishness in the worst light. He, he hopes, is
going to be King and she, on her own admission, is not going to be Queen. Who,
then, has a first claim on the ``royal role''? This is my best guess at what
the ``fight to the end'' is really about.
It may seem an odd hyperbole for an essentially trivial dispute. ``No, Diana, I
shall wield the scissors that cut the tape that open this fascinating
exhibition of British widgets in Outer Mongolia. No, Charles, I shall'' - this
assuming that they can ever again be got together for more than about an hour.
But it is a dispute that clearly means much more to the princess herself. And I
think her interview told us why, if not in so many words. The once beautiful,
charming but naive and innocent Lady Diana Spencer has been destroyed by the 14
years of her marriage. If she had never met a prince, she might today have been
living an undemandingly happy and comfortable life with some thick army
officer, or have been ensconced in another stately home than Althorp with a
chinless but harmless aristocratic twit.
That fate and that felicity were denied her by the wiles of the Queen Mother
and her own father - not, indeed, in a spirit of malice, because they believed
the marriage to be one made in heaven. But what it required was for Lady Diana
Spencer, under her delectable outward form, to be emptied out and remade: not
as an upper-class gal wealthy yet unimportant enough to do what she wanted, but
as a member of the ruling dynasty who can only do what she must or what she is
told. To the extent that a warm human being was killed, and a royal automaton
put in its place, she must have our every sympathy.
It means that royalty is just about all she has, which explains why she is so
desperate to hang on to it. At the same time, her dilemma points up what an
inhuman institution royalty is. It is just not there for the sake of individual
wants and needs, but to fulfil a function in the state, that coldest of cold
monsters.
That she can for one moment confuse these two worlds, the inner and the outer,
shows how little she has even yet understood her life. But her husband is just
as bad. This is why the monarchy is in such a mess.
We might pause to compare the marriage of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of
Edinburgh. Do we know whether they are, or ever have been, in love? We know
they do not habitually sleep together, from the time a nutcase broke into
Buckingham Palace to find Her Majesty alone in bed, and she diverted him by
offering him a cigarette.
Why on earth does the Queen, a non-smoker, keep cigarettes in her bedroom? In
case Princess Margaret drops by? For a secret paramour? Such questions scarcely
matter because this royal marriage meets its purpose to provide the monarch
with a consort and with heirs. What any of them do beyond that is nobody else's
business. So it is irrelevant whether they love one another.
The modern age has done for this simple, if scarcely attractive, form of
dynastic alliance. Charles seems to me most to blame, with his woolly notions
of making monarchy meaningful, not just to be, but to do. He is enough of a
child of his time to feel a divine discontent with his own and the general
condition, but his circumstances are such as never to have forced him beyond
vague romantic yearnings about it, and he is too arrogant to perceive why
others find these futile. The same with his love-life: he cannot reconcile duty
and happiness. But his wife is in no better case.
In fact both are victims of an era which assumes that personal gratification is
the chief end of existence. They have not bothered to work out, indeed have not
stopped to think, whether this assumption - which they share - can be held
within the austere mould of an ancient institution. Monarchy and the modern age
may in fact be incompatible. In the wrecked lives of two miserable people, we
see that ruthlessly exposed.

THE SFA announced yesterday that all seven players whose cases had been
considered at their disciplinary committee meeting on Monday would now be
summoned to appear at Park Gardens on Thursday, November 30.
That is the next scheduled meeting of the committee and the players will be
asked to explain their actions in the various games.
Paul Gascoigne, John Brown and Alan McLaren, of Rangers, as well as Aberdeen's
Billy Dodds will all be carpetted on the basis of a report from the referee
supervisor, Don McVicar, who has apparently highlighted some of the incidents
in the Rangers-Aberdeen match on November 11 which were missed by the referee,
John Rowbotham.
Rangers are unhappy about the growing role of the supervisors in these
circumstances. The Ibrox club point to the Laws of the Game, where the referee
is named as the sole arbiter and it seems that they are seeking guidelines from
the SFA over the interference by supervisors into matters which would normally
come under the referee's control.
As well as the events from that controversial clash three other players will be
in front of the committee next week
Airdrie's Sean Sweeney, whose kick at the grounded Morton Wieghorst of Dundee
in the Coca-Cola Cup semi-final at McDiarmid Park was caught by the television
cameras as well as the supervisor; Alan Lawrence of Hearts, whose elbowing of
Rangers' Craig Moore was also caught by the SFA's man in the stand; and
Dumbarton's Ian McFarlane, who collected two red cards in the game against
Airdrie.

PAUL Gascoigne claims he has given up beer and ``guzzling'' in an effort to
recapture the glory days.
The Rangers midfielder says his days of fish and chips washed down with
Newcastle Brown ale are gone. He now loves Chinese and Italian food.
``I haven't had a beer for months. If I drink at all, it's wine or champagne,''
says Gascoigne, who was once famed for his love of Mars bars, in a health
magazine.
``I am studying books about wine and am becoming a bit of a wine buff. The
guzzling days are gone and my only lapse is to have a few toffees.''
But Gascoigne, whose career has suffered through bad leg injuries, says he is
``hungrier than ever'' for success. ``I'd like to have been the greatest
footballer in the world, but a few injuries have stopped me. Without them, I'd
have been a match for anyone.''
Gascoigne, once said to be ``daft as a brush'' by former England manager Bobby
Robson, also says anyone who writes him off as stupid is making a mistake.
``People think I'm daft and stupid,'' he says. ``They are wrong. I can be smart
and snidey if I want. I just want to be friends with everybody.''
q SUNDAY'S Coca-Cola Cup final between Aberdeen and Dundee at Hampden will be a
35,000 sell-out. Both clubs have had their ticket allocations snapped up,
despite live television coverage on two channels.
q JOHN Colquhoun remained a Hearts player yesterday when a proposed swop deal
with Raith Rovers broke down.
Stark's Park manager Jimmy Nicholl was ready to offer Barry Wilson plus cash
for the Tynecastle winger, but Colquhoun failed to agree terms with the
Kirkcaldy club.

DOUG Walker, winner of the #4000 first prize in last year's New Year Sprint,
has entered this year's event, the draw for which will be made on Sunday.
Walker, who gave up rugby at Heriot's to concentrate on athletics, has among
his rivals six-time Scottish senior 100m champion Elliot Bunney, who has given
up athletics and now plays rugby . . . for Heriot's.
Bunney, who scored three tries on his debut with the Edinburgh club, being
promoted to the first XV for last weekend's cancelled match against Stirling
County, will use the meeting on December 30 and 31 to remain sharp for his new
sport.
A further interesting twist is the possibility of him facing former fiancee Mel
Neef, who along with another Scottish champion, Aileen McGillivary, aspires to
be the first female to win the 126-year old event.
Other winners of major games sprints, in an increased entry of 102 for the 110
metres, include Kevin Williams (Cardiff), who won Jedburgh off scratch; Lee
Notman (Hawick), winner at Selkirk; Stephen Shanks (Scottish Borders), who won
the #2000 Walkerburn event; and David Rae, who won on his own turf at Hawick.

THEY'RE on the road again. Briefly. Tomorrow, the BBC Scottish Symphony
Orchestra - the band that has the capability of giving a bus trip to the Sands
Centre in Carlisle the dimensions of an international tour - takes off on a
short, two-concert hop to France.
Organised by the IMG management group, whose roster of conductors includes
Jerzy Maksymiuk, Polish conductor laureate of the BBC SSO, the tour was
originally intended to contain between five and seven concerts. As is the way
of such things these days, it shrank. (The Scottish Chamber Orchestra,
currently touring Japan, is experiencing the same problem.) Still, two days are
better than no days.
And the two concerts the SSO will give in Bordeaux (tomorrow) and Metz, near
the German border (on Friday) do contain several rather special elements. The
phenomenal percussionist Evelyn Glennie will accompany the group, and will give
two performances of James MacMillan's percussion concerto, subtitled Veni, Veni
Emmanuel.
But that's perhaps not in itself the most interesting feature of the
programmes. What is most striking about these performances of the MacMillan is
that the concerto - which was a commission by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra -
is going to be played, for the first time, by the old team of MacMillan
specialists, Jerzy Maksymiuk and the BBC SSO.
Now folk can say what they like, and if I'm accused of being partial, then
tough. The fact of the matter is this. The SSO play this sort of stuff with a
zest and a fire in the belly that few others - though they might produce more
polished performances - can emulate. The SSO are the hard cases of MacMillan's
music.
There are two reasons for this: one, the SSO has a 60-year tradition of
contemporary music under its belt. And the other is Jerzy Maksymiuk. He has
taken MacMillan's music to pieces (analytically speaking) and to his heart.
Way back, a year or so before fame engulfed MacMillan, Maksymiuk and the SSO
took his first major orchestral work, Tryst, on a European tour, and cracked
it. The style was assimilated, and the benchmark set.
Then came the phenomenon of The Confession of Isobel Gowdie, with which the
Maksymiuk/SSO team launched MacMillan on a huge London Prom audience, breaking
the record for ovations, and kicking off his international career. They've done
it many times since, and it's as thunderous, lacerating, and moving now as it
was then.
The SSO has also played MacMillan's trumpet concerto, Epiclesis, and will be
doing so again in a Cutting Edge concert later this season. And now, with its
original soloist, the remarkable Evelyn Glennie, the specialists - Maksymiuk
and the band from Broadcasting House - take on Veni, Veni Emmanuel.
This astonishing piece, just three years old, has already been performed
worldwide. Since its Prom debut in 1992 (another sensational success for
MacMillan) it has been performed 77 times. This season alone it has received
more than 30 performances.
Most of them have featured the tireless Evelyn Glennie, though other
percussionists are now taking it up - last week a young tyro played it at the
Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, and Colin Currie will be playing it
with the RSNO next March.
The original players - the SCO - were electric performers of the piece. But
anyone who knows the Maksymiuk/SSO style with MacMillan must eagerly anticipate
the forthcoming French performances, which will, in due course, be broadcast on
Radio 3. Watch this space.

THE former champions were on parade in Preston yesterday with John Parrott,
Jimmy White, and Ronnie O'Sullivan all on cue to reach the last 16 of the
#380,000 Royal Liver Assurance UK Championship.
The star turn, however, was Scotland's John Higgins. For the second successive
round he compiled back-to-back centuries during a superb first-session display
against French Canadian Alain Robidoux.
The world No.11, a slender 5-4 victor over Robidoux at Sunderland last month,
had runs of 95, 55, 56, 62, and a vital 56 clearance to steal the eighth frame
on the black and finish a good afternoon's work at 7-1 ahead. The Scot sealed
victory by clinching the first two frames last night.
In just three seasons in the paid ranks, the British and International Open
champion has overtaken the career total of 45 century breaks made by
controversial namesake Alex.
Parrott, the world No.4, was 5-0 ahead before opponent Willie Thorne won his
only frame, the session ending at 7-1 to the popular Liverpudlian.
White, the 1992 champion, took a 6-2 afternoon lead over Essex player Stuart
Reardon and became Higgins' next opponent when he completed a 9-4 victory last
night.
O'Sullivan, the youngest winner of a ranking event when he beat Stephen Hendry
in the 1993 final, took a 5-3 lead over Welshman Paul Davies.
Leith's Chris Small, who put out world No.16 David Roe in his first match, took
a handsome 7-1 overnight lead over Basingstoke's Mark Flowerdew, and world
champion Hendry completed a good day for the Scots by racing to a 6-2 lead over
Nottingham's Anthony Hamilton last night. Results and positions:
J Higgins (Sco) beat A Robidoux (Canada) 9-1, G Wilkinson (Eng) beat T
Griffiths (Wal) 9-3, J White (Eng) beat S Reardon (Eng) 9-4, K Doherty (Ire)
beat J Ferguson (Eng) 9-4.
C Small (Sco) leads M Flowerdew (Eng) 7-1, D Morgan (Wales) level with D Taylor
(N Ire) 4-4, J Parrott (Eng) leads Willie Thorne (Eng) 7-1, R O'Sullivan (Eng)
leads P Davies (Wales) 5-3. Matches resume 1pm today.
S Hendry (Sco) leads A Hamilton (Eng) 6-2; J Wattana (Thailand) leads D O'Kane
(NZ) 5-3; P Ebdon (Eng) level at 4-4 with M Stevens (Wal); S Lee (Eng) level at
4-4 with N Foulds (Eng). Matches resume tonight.

IT is not entirely their fault, but Hibs could find themselves setting an
undesirable record tonight when they meet Partick Thistle at Easter Road in a
premier division match rearranged as a result of an electrical fault which
affected the floodlights.
To date, the smallest league attendance at their ground this season is the 8790
against Falkirk on October 7, but it will be a big surprise if that low is not
well beaten tonight.
To reschedule a league game on the same night as a Champions' League fixture
involving a Scottish club seems pretty unsound management, never mind the
availability on satellite of other Champions' League contests, but under the
rules the game must go on in the first available midweek and rules, it seems,
is rules. For Hibs, there are other worrying portents to keep them concentrated
on the job in hand, however, compared with their mood when they went into the
game two weeks ago. At that stage they were six points behind league leaders
Rangers and in good form, after having beaten Aberdeen at Pittodrie.
Now, after having lost to Falkirk and then Hearts, they are 11 points adrift of
the champions and confidence, inevitably, will have sunk in parallel with their
defeats. Their manager, Alex Miller, could list a catalogue of injuries which
have seriously depleted his forces at a crucial time, but the Easter Road fans
will not accept any rationale if they suffer a third successive defeat.
The loss of strikers Keith Wright and Kevin Harper, allied to the illness of
Darren Jackson, who played against Hearts but clearly was not fully recovered,
added further chaos to a staff that has been severely dented this season, with
Graeme Mitchell, David Farrell, Willie Miller, Mickey Weir, Kevin McAllister,
Andy Millen, Gordon Hunter, and Steven Tweed all missing out at various stages.
Millen returned at Tynecastle and, in the circumstances, did well and will need
to do so again as the injury crisis, if anything, is worse.
Harper has already been ruled out until after Christmas, Mitchell similarly,
and Wright and Jackson are doubtful starters. Add to that the fact that Michael
O'Neill is suspended after having been sent off at Tynecastle and you can see
the problems facing the manager. ``It is not the happiest of situations,'' said
Miller, ``but we'll have a roll call in the morning and get on with it."
In contrast, Thistle should be unchanged from the side that beat Falkirk on
Saturday, a performance of grit and determination that pleased manager Murdo
MacLeod. ``I also thought we passed the ball around well in the first half and
we will need to do that against a team like Hibs. We have players like Tommy
Turner, Derek McWilliams, and Ian Cameron who like to play passes, and if we
get that and the same commitment we could do well again.''
If they win, Thistle would move up to fifth bottom, although Murdo preferred to
call it sixth top, and at the same time yet again send shivers down the necks
of a few others in the lower region.

RAITH Rovers manager Jimmy Nicholl perhaps had a smile of satisfaction on his
face last night when news of the latest UEFA Cup match to be played in the
Olympic Stadium, Munich, filtered through to Kirkcaldy.
Rovers were beaten 2-1 by Bayern in Germany in a second-round match, but the
giants of Portuguese football, Benfica, were really given a going over, on a
night when Jurgen Klinsmann certainly enjoyed himself.
The striker scored all four goals in Bayern's 4-1 success in their third round,
first-leg tie, a result that virtually secures the Germans a place in the next
round.
Klinsmann opened the scoring after 27 minutes, and with two minutes remaining
before the break, Bayern were 3-1 ahead, with Dimas scoring for Benfica.
However, after half-time, Klinsmann took up where he had left off just minutes
earlier and completed the scoring.
A good result that could have been better, however, for in a superb
counter-attack late in the second half, Bulgarian substitute Emil Kostadinov
hit the bar with a powerful shot from the edge of the box.
``It's fun when you get passes like that. It was a joy,'' Klinsmann said, while
his coach, Otto Rehhagel, added: ``He had a great day . . . It is a comfortable
lead. It should be enough but it is not over yet. There will be a 100,000 crowd
in Portugal.''
Another German side, Werder Bremen, were not so successful, going down 2-1 on
the night in Holland against PSV Eindhoven. Ronaldo, with a penalty after eight
minutes, and Luc Nilis were on target for PSV, with Marco Bode scoring for
Bremen.
Nottingham Forest fans were kept waiting before their side eventually saw off
Lyon, of France.
The winning goal and the drama surrounding it came after 83 minutes and were
the highlights of an otherwise dour match. Lyon's Florent Laville was sent off
for deliberate hand ball inside the area, and from the resulting penalty kick,
Forest's Stuart Pearce struck the ball straight at Lyon keeper Pascal Olmeta.
But to the joy of the Forest fans, 20-year-old substitute Paul McGregor
followed up to slot the rebound home.
There was better news for French rivals Bordeaux, who will take a 2-0 lead into
the second leg of their tie against Real Betis after goals from Daniel Dutuel
and substitute Laurent Croci.
In the Czech Republic, Slavia Prague and Racing Lens, of France, drew 0-0,
while goals from Peter Moeller and Ole Bjur in Copenhagen gave Brondby a 2-1
victory against Roma, for whom Daniel Fonseca scored the all-important away
goal.
A goal from Gheorghe Hagi after 69 minutes gave Barcelona a 1-1 result against
Seville in the all-Spanish tie.

THE acrimony between the UK's livestock auctioneers and the meat trade over the
latter's demand that a deduction of #3.50 per head should be made in the marts
on all cattle destined for slaughter is worsening.
The trade claims #3.50 is half the cost of removing specified bovine offal in
the fight to rid the national herd of cattle brain disease or BSE. So far the
auctioneers and all the farming unions have opposed any deductions, while the
major buyers have responded by boycotting live auctions.
Last Sunday more than 100 auctioneers from all over the UK met in
Stoke-on-Trent. The Scottish auction companies were represented by Willie
Blair, the president of their institute.
Speaking yesterday at Edinburgh's Gorgie mart, Mr Blair said: ``We put a motion
forward saying we recognise the industry problems and, therefore, joint
meetings of all abattoir operators, producer bodies and auctioneers should be
set up prior to meeting the Ministry of Agriculture with the utmost urgency to
address the industry-wide problem caused by BSE.''
However, the auctioneers demanded the immediate withdrawal of the request for a
levy and asked for ``a return to normal trading conditions''.
The trade found this unacceptable. A handful of meat companies have broken
ranks and are buying live cattle again. In the meantime, abattoirs, in an
attempt to maintain through-put, are frequently paying over the odds on the
farm to acquire cattle. Premiums of between 5p and 7p per kg are being quoted.
In the cattle ring of John Swan &amp; Sons in Edinburgh yesterday the position was
clear for all to see. A notice at the rostrum said: ``The company will only
deduct the statutory levies currently agreed and has no authority to make any
other deductions.''
That position was widely supported by farmers. Jim Pate from Galashiels, who
sits on the NFUS council, commented: ``I understand the problem but I'm totally
against a levy. If they (the trade) needed them they should bid less for
cattle. They should only pay what they can afford. That's how I operate my
business.''

MANCHESTER United may be one of the most exciting teams in Britain but their
manager, Alex Ferguson, would like to see his men display more of a killer
touch as they attempt to pressurise Premiership leaders Newcastle.
It was around this time a year ago that the St James's Park side, who had led
from the start of the season as they have done this campaign, started to lose
their way.
Victory at Coventry tonight would leave the second-placed Manchester side
within three points of the top and poised to take advantage of any similar
lapse by Kevin Keegan's side.
Ferguson, however, would like to boost his club's goals tally - something that
should have happened on Saturday when they hit three in the first eight minutes
against Southampton. ``We have never really been able to kill teams off and
that is something I have never been able to understand,'' said Ferguson.
Coventry are without a win in their last 11 games, but Ferguson will still pay
Ron Atkinson's side due respect. ``There are no easy games at this level,''
said Ferguson, ``and I don't take anything for granted. We have broken away
from the pack and now we need to show the concentration, determination, and
attitude to stay there.''
Stan Collymore has his first start in eight games for Liverpool at West Ham.
The striker has scored just two goals since his #8.5m move from Nottingham
Forest but, because Ian Rush is injured, gets a chance to help Liverpool end a
sequence of three successive defeats.
West Ham are likely to be unchanged, with John Harkes and Danny Williamson
retained after the 3-0 victory at Bolton.
Everton, at home to QPR, wait on Craig Short (groin) but fellow defender Gary
Ablett is out for eight weeks with damaged knee ligaments.
David Unsworth wins a recall, but suspension-free Barry Horne will probably
have to wait for another chance. ``He has accepted what I've said,'' said
manager Joe Royle. ``He doesn't like it - he wants to be in the team, which is
the attitude I want.''
Ray Wilkins' QPR are without Ian Holloway and David Bardsley, both suspended,
while Wimbledon can call on #600,000 defender Andy Pearce to face Manchester
City at Maine Road.

DEREK McInnes, Rangers' latest signing, must wait a little longer before being
considered for the Ibrox first team. The #300,000 capture from Morton has just
discovered that he has gone over the 16 points suspension limit and now faces a
two-match ban.
McInnes is ruled out of the matches with Hibs and Hearts but could make his
debut for Rangers against Partick Thistle on December 9. By then, it will be
Paul Gascoigne, shown a yellow card against Celtic at the weekend, who will be
ruled out.
q SCOTLAND'S Under-21 side, who have reached the quarter-finals of the European
Championships, have not been invited to the Toulon International Tournament
next summer. And to add salt to the wound, England will take part in the French
event.
The Scots, who have competed in Toulon for the past five years and twice been
semi-finalists, have been passed over, a decision that has surprised SFA
spokesman David Findlay. ``This is news to us,'' he said. ``We have enjoyed a
long relationship with the tournament organisers who said that invites would be
issued in the autumn. We were still awaiting ours but it is an invitational
event so that's life.''
q JIMMY Case, the former Liverpool player, has agreed to become manager with
Brighton in succession to Liam Brady.
q THE Scottish League have re-scheduled the matches involving Coca-Cola Cup
finalists Aberdeen and Dundee cancelled on Saturday. Dundee will meet Dumbarton
in their first division match on Tuesday, December 5, while Aberdeen's premier
division game against Kilmarnock will be played the following evening.
q AIRDRIE and Hamilton aim soon to announce good news for their supporters.
Both have suffered from the loss of a home base, with Hamilton playing at
Firhill and Airdrie at Broadwood.
Airdrie chairman George Peat confirmed that negotiations to find a site for a
new stadium were progressing. ``We hope to announce something concrete within a
month,'' he said, while Hamilton secretary Scott Struthers also confirmed that
much of the planning work had been completed for their projected new stadium
near their previous home at Douglas Park.

LIFE'S rich tapestry is certainly stitched together with the most colourful of
threads in Tom McGrath's adaptation of Tankred Dorst and Ursula Ehler's fantasy
adventure.
We have the clash of the forces of evil and good, magic, prophesy, war,
romance, debasement, and lots of bawdy humour.
It's a big bold piece directed with great exuberance by 7:84's Iain Reekie who
does not flinch from accentuating the grotesque and the ridiculous.
Consequently there are some excellent comic scenes, with the third-year BA
students revelling in McGrath's idiosyncratic script; as Arthur ponders what
kind of table to sit his knights around, a recalcitrant carpenter suggests a
nice drop-leaf number or some nest tables might be adequate.
But alongside caricatures and the post-modern irony - a white-suited Mark Twain
continually popping up to comment on the action as the Yankee at King Arthur's
Court - there is a rigorous and revolving celebration of conviction and
idealism, of man transcending his immediate limitations in the quest of a
purity symbolised by the Holy Grail.
The cast are to be commended for balancing a sincerity of performance alongside
the bubbling comedy.
Audacious in action and structure it's also a vividly splendid piece with a
simple but striking fantasy set from Evelyn Barbour.
Reekie adds quirky touches to this eccentric drama such as a gallus Merlin -
playfully realised by Carolyn Craig - transforming from a thoughtful lad in a
babygrow to a whirlwind of a wizard to a decadent crone in a black lace ball
gown.

THE sale of two Scottish newspapers has been referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
The referral, announced yesterday, relates to the proposed takeover of the
Aberdeen-based Press and Journal and Evening Express by Northcliffe Newspapers,
a subsidiary of Daily Mail and General Trust.
The #82m acquisition from the Thomson Corporation, which was concluded earlier
this month, also includes a free weekly newspaper and three associated
specialist titles.
Their sale was announced at the same time as the Canadian-based company
announced that the new owners of the Scotsman were to be businessmen David and
Frederick Barclay, proprietors of The European newspaper.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday's referral followed the
general rule which applied in this case, since the new owner already publishes
papers with daily sales of more than 500,000.
A report is expected from the MMC by the end of January. The commission has
asked two individuals to help with its findings: Robert Kernohan, former editor
of the Church of Scotland magazine, Life and Work, and former London editor of
The Herald; and Timothy Willis, a former chief executive of the South China
Morning Post.
Northcliffe Newspapers declined to comment on yesterday's announcement.

OZZIE, Ozzie, Ozzie! Where is he? He should be on by now. Ozzie, Ozzie, Ozzie!
The long-haired flagellants are becoming demented, whipping themselves into a
blurred frenzy. This is getting serious. Ozzie, Ozzie, Ozzie!
Lights at the back of the stage, and Forrest Gump on two huge video screens?
Look, there's Ozzie, sitting beside the Gumpster, mouthing home-spun words of
wisdom. And look, Ozzie's voguing with Madonna . . . and blasting weed with big
Bill Clinton - and there's Elvis and the Beatles, fawning before Ozzie's cloven
feet. Amazing!
Then, squealing the words ``Glasgow, let's go cray-zee!'', the one-time magnet
for every loonball in the US trotted on stage and officially opened this year's
panto season. Will there be a better one? I think not.
Decapitating small beasts and eating raw offal may no longer feature in his
act, but this fellah still knows how to have fun. Substituting water for the
more traditional virgin's blood, he sprayed us and the band from his
personalised water cannon. What a hoot!
Just when you thought you could laugh no more he dropped his drawers and
mooned, exposing buttocks in all their glory, then launched into a routine of
energetic squat-thrusts. When viewed in close-up on the video screen, the
thought struck that if Ozzie ditched the conditioning work and put on a couple
of pounds, he'd be a dead ringer for Paul Gascoigne; particularly during
Paranoid.
The music was pretty much as you'd expect, a tight mix of Sabbath and solo
stuff, but at an Ozzie show the performance is all. Oh yes, it is!

SHIRES Investment, a trust managed by Glasgow Investment Managers, narrowly
underperformed the FTSE Actuaries All-share index during the six months to
September 30.
Total returns from the trust, which aims for both high income and capital
growth, were 14%, slightly less than the 15.1% total return on the All-Share
index.
The trust was held back by the lacklustre performance of its fixed income
securities, which were cut from 19% to 15% of its #102m investment portfolio.
Convertible bonds, which appeared to offer good value, were boosted from 9% to
14%.
But high-yielding shares remain the backbone of the trust, which focuses on
general industrial and service sector stocks.
Despite a 7% improvement in earnings per share, the interim dividend was held
unchanged at 8.30p.
Short-term borrowings of #3m were used to boost #19.3m of longer term debt,
raising the gearing ratio to nearly 30% of net assets.
Looking ahead, trust chairman Michael Hardie said profit growth from UK
companies should be steady rather than spectacular, but the economy appeared
headed for a period of relative stability not seen since the 1960s. This in
turn should offer ``an attractive environment for equity investors,'' he added.

TODAY will bring publication of National Grid's results and the prospectus
accompanying the flotation. While the National Grid flotation appears to be all
but home and dry, privatisation of British Rail is proving to be more of an
uphill battle.
Its flotation moved further down the track with the recent sale of the three
rolling stock companies (ROSCOs) for a total of #1800m. Together with cash
retained by the public sector, proceeds will be more than #2500m.
However, the most problematic element, the sale of Railtrack, the company that
owns, manages and maintains the track, signalling and stations, still has to
come. It is pencilled in for next spring although sweeteners in the form of
generous subsidies will have to be added if the City is to be encouraged to
invest heavily.
Only this week Railtrack was the subject of controversy over an alleged #1000m
squirreled away, supposedly to boost profitability after privatisation.
However, Railtrack says the money is legitimately set aside for future
investment.
There remain many opponents to British Rail privatisation and the sale of
Railtrack in particular. As a vital piece of domestic infrastructure for both
the public and business, there is indeed a case for it remaining majority owned
by the Government. However that does not mean that there is no scope for a
partnership with the private sector expertise on particular investment projects.
Just as people who know about local government finance argued against the poll
tax, so most railway professionals and transport commentators - both in Britain
and overseas - regard as fundamentally flawed the split between infrastructure
and train services. Indeed, vertically integrated structures have been chosen
as the role model for privatising railways in Japan and franchising the system
in Argen- tina.
Bill Bradshaw, professor and senior research fellow at Wolfson College,
Oxford, who is firmly against the sale of Railtrack, makes an interesting point
when he says that track and signalling is an active element in the provision of
a reliable service. Statistics on the punctuality of the West Coast main line,
for instance, show more than half of delays are caused by infrastructure faults.
Professor Bradshaw likens running a railway successfully to the ultimate team
game, in which all the train operators and the people responsible for stations,
track and rolling stock must co-operate.
He is well placed to comment because he was formerly director of oper- ations
and of the policy unit at British Rail.
Writing in New Economy, the Institute for Public Policy Research's quarterly
economic journal, Professor Bradshaw suggests that, if Railtrack has been sold
by the next election, it should be re-acquired by the state at its sale price.
He advises that such an intention be made known to potential purchasers.
One of the Government's aims in privatising British Rail is to generate
competition. However, the railway already has more than enough competition from
road and air travel.
While such a separation of track from trains might be good news for the bosses
of the privatised railtrack it will probably prove to be not as advantageous
for customers.
It is questionable how a company such as Railtrack, which will be one step
removed from the customer, can hope to satisfy their demands. Even utilities
such as gas and water, who like to trumpet how much of their focus is on the
consumer, face problems in this regard.
If the railway is sold and the Tory Government wins the next general election
then we are likely to see a repeat of the customer service fiascos and public
relations disasters which have dogged British Gas.
In addition, it is likely that in its haste to sell-off Railtrack at what will
undoubtedly be a knock-down price, the Government is storing up political
trouble for the years ahead.

CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE
BLACKBURN manager Ray Harford will take a closer than usual look at one of the
opposition this evening when the English champions take on Spartak Moscow in
the Luzniki Stadium in a Group B match.
Winger Ilia Tsimbalar, who tormented the Rovers defence when Spartak beat
Harford's men in the opening Champions' League fixture in September, has
attracted the attention of the English manager, who admitted he would be more
than interested in bringing Tsimbalar to Ewood if he could.
``I know that three or four of the Spartak team are being head-hunted,
particularly as their season has finished,'' said Harford, who added that he
was keen to have a look at the player in action, and not just this evening.
``Before the Champions' League starts again in March, Spartak will be playing
some friendlies in Germany and Holland. I'll certainly be going out to watch
those games and see if I can get a clearer opinion of him. Tsimbalar is a good
player and somebody I would be interested in buying.''
The English champions, now with no chance of qualifying from the section, have
suddenly found form in domestic competition, as their 7-0 success against
Nottingham Forest proves, but Rovers will be without the Norwegian midfield
player Lars Bohinen, and now Harford may well choose to experiment with his
line-up.
In the same group, Rosenborg will have to play without key midfielder
Karl-Petter Loeken in their make-or-break match against Legia Warsaw in Norway.
Loeken damaged a knee in a recent European Championship qualifier. Rosenborg
must beat the Poles to keep alive their hopes of reaching the next round.
Greek champions Panathinaikos meet Aalborg in a Group A game and will be
without defender Yannis Kalitzakis, sent off against the Danish side last
month, while in Portugal, Bobby Robson's Porto must defeat Nantes if they are
to progress further in the tournament.
Robson was upbeat that his side could get a result. ``If we win 1-0 that would
be marvellous,'' he said. ``If we can score early on we will get more
confident. But `if' is a big word in football.''
Spanish champions Real Madrid, who beat city rivals Atletico at the weekend,
have been boosted by the return of striker Ivan Zamorano, top scorer in Spain
last season, but will be without Fernando Hierro for the match against Ajax.
The Dutch team take a 19-man squad to Madrid, then fly to Tokyo for the world
club title match against South Americans Gremio on November 28.
Ferencvaros, who take on Grasshoppers, will be very interested in the result in
Madrid. The Hungarian side could still qualify for the quarter-final stage if
they win and Real Madrid draw or lose.

IT IS fair to say Rangers have under-achieved so far in their Champions' League
group yet they still have a chance, albeit a small one, of qualifying for the
quarter-finals. Maximum points from their last two Group C matches could be
enough to give Rangers second place behind Juventus, who are clearly the class
side in the section, but two wins will be secured only if Walter Smith's side
can rise above the mediocrity which has dogged them since the first match two
months ago.
Then they lost 1-0 to tonight's opponents, Steaua Bucharest, despite having
defended admirably, but if appropriate revenge is to be taken the Ibrox side,
which will be without Ian Ferguson, who aggravated a hamstring injury against
Celtic on Sunday, will have to produce much more than stout hearts at the back.
This time Rangers must produce some ingenuity. If not, it really will be over
and the match against Borussia Dortmund in Germany next month will have no
bearing on qualification so far as Rangers may be concerned.
One of the players bought in to Ibrox to provide the necessary elan has still
to sparkle outwith the premier division, but Brian Laudrup intends to do what
he can to help his team salvage something from what looks like a pretty
hopeless cause. ``This is our last chance,'' he said. ``It is the final
opportunity for us. Our team needs a good performance and I will try to help
deliver that.
``If we can win this game we might be able to go to Germany and have a very
special game against Dortmund. It won't matter if the game against Steaua turns
out to be the worst game of the year, because Rangers must grab this chance.''
Laudrup, who came back into Rangers' first team only on Sunday after a lengthy
period on the sidelines because of injury, said he was feeling ``stiff and
tight'' after the Old Firm match, in which he scored, and he added that he
might not be able to last the full 90 minutes. ``It will take three, maybe
four, weeks to get my full sharpness back, but I will try to do my best against
Steaua,'' he said.
The Danish internationalist believes the Romanians might not be so good away
from home and he feels that if Rangers can reproduce the commitment and the
will shown against Celtic on Sunday, a win should be possible. In common with
Rangers manager Walter Smith, he feels it is important to take Juventus out of
the picture because, along with Ajax, they are on a different level and both
men take heart from the fact that the games against Steaua and Dortmund
-Rangers drew 2-2 with the German champions when they met at Ibrox at the end
of September - have been very close.
Laudrup added that when he signed for Rangers the prospect of playing in the
Champions' League excited him, but injuries have plagued him and he has been
unable to play in more than a few European ties. ``It was terrible having to
watch, but now we have a chance and, although two games in a short period of
four days will be difficult for me, I will be doing all I can.''
He was asked to comment about the speculation over his future and, although
Rangers were unhappy with the question, he was comfortable with it and said:
``I have never said anything about wanting to leave and if at the end of my
contract the club want to offer me another one, I would think about that.''
Laudrup, who signed a three-year deal in July last year, added that he hoped to
be able to see out his time. ``After that I don't know what will happen. I am
not clairvoyant,'' he said.
The normally stoical Smith reacted angrily to interest in Laudrup's contract,
but perhaps his wrath should have been directed at those of his players who
have not yet provided a proper return for the money they are paid. Rangers are
struggling in the Champions' League not simply because they were unfortunate
enough to be drawn in a group with a team, Juventus, who are so obviously
superior, but because their general play has lacked intelligence and flair.
As Laudrup says, this is their last chance to do something positive about their
position in Group C and the absence of Ferguson shouldn't hinder them too much,
if at all. Neither should the suspension of Alex Cleland, who was sent off
against Juventus in Turin.
Indeed, Smith himself dismissed Cleland's ban, pointing out that the likes of
Alan McLaren, who returns tonight after suspension, played at right full back
last season. The manager included 18-year-old Scott Wilson and a 19-year-old,
Steven Boyack, in his squad and one of them will be on the bench, although he
won't be used.
Smith has decided on the three foreigners who will be used and they are likely
to be Gordan Petric, Paul Gascoigne, and Laudrup, with Oleg Salenko the one who
could be idle.
``Take Juventus away and there is not a lot between the other teams,'' Smith
said, ``and this time I would like to see more of a team performance from my
players. That's what we need more than anything else and that's what has
hindered us most in the Champions' League.
``I also want to see us do more on the ball and be more aggressive in attack.''
Smith dismissed the view of Steaua's coach Dumitru Dumitriu, who said on
arrival in Glasgow that both teams needed miracles to qualify. ``I think he is
underestimating his team's chances,'' said Smith. ``If Steaua should win at
Ibrox they would have seven points and need a draw at home to Juventus in their
final match.
``Maybe he's the Romanian Jim McLean.''

RANGERS go into the Champions' League match tonight knowing their fate in the
competition could be decided in Turin, where runaway Group C leaders Juventus
play Borussia Dortmund.
If their already slender hopes of qualifying for the quarter-finals are to be
kept alive, the Ibrox side need to beat Steaua and hope the Italian champions
do the same to Dortmund, but the word from Turin last night was not good.
Juventus, who have 12 points from their four matches so far, are expected to
field a second-string side against the Germans, who have five points from their
four ties.
Dortmund beat Steaua 1-0 then drew 0-0 with the Romanians, and drew 2-2 with
Rangers, but a win in the Stadio Delle Alpi would guarantee the second
qualifying place for the Germans.
Juventus coach Marcello Lippi looks likely to rest some of his star players.
Striker Fabrizio Ravanelli is injured and defender Moreno Torricelli is
suspended, but apparently Lippi will leave out the Italian game's newest
superstar, Alessandro del Piero, and midfield players Didier Deschamps, Paulo
Sousa, and Antonio Conte.
Ciro Ferrara, a defender, is also to be spelled, much to the dismay of Rangers
manager Walter Smith. ``This would not help our cause at all,'' he said. ``I
would hope that if Juventus do leave out several first-choice players, UEFA
would want to know what is going on.''
Rangers, of course, have to beat Steaua and hope Juventus win, which would mean
the premier division side, who have only one point going into tonight's tie,
could go to Germany in a fortnight and qualify by winning there.
However, if Dortmund win this evening, it will be all over.

way. Make a date; from February 7 to 17, New York, New York is no longer the
wonderful town - that title belongs to Glasgow, which will play host to a
beanfeast of American popular and classical music entitled I Like to be in
America.
Centred around a series of six orchestral concerts, to be given over 10 days by
the Royal Scottish National and Scottish Chamber Orchestras in the Royal
Concert Hall, the festival will provide a vehicle for every strand of American
orchestral music, from the classic to the contemporary.
From Barber's Adagio to Bernstein's On the Town; Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue to
Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man and Appalachian Spring; an evening devoted
to the music of Broadway to the newest of contemporary music by America's
leading composers Ellen Zwilich and Ronald Caltabiano; it's all there.
Something from everyone, something for everyone.
Leonard Bernstein gets an evening to himself with, as well as On the Town, his
Serenade, Facsimile, and the symphonic dances from West Side Story. The
Broadway night is a glorious stream of melody with music from Cole Porter,
Rodgers and Hart, and Jerome Kern; singers Kim Criswell and George Dvorsky,
direct from Broadway, promise the authentic touch.
And there's more. Uniquely American originals - the pioneers - such as Charles
Ives, are represented, as well as a generation of composers whose names may be
familiar to music lovers, but whose music has never made it to the concert
repertoire in this country - William Schuman and Walter Piston.
Around the core six concerts - the latest collaboration between the RSNO and
SCO - there will be chamber music, theatre, visual art, and films.
The Paragon Ensemble will bring their own expertise to contemporary American
chamber music, focusing on American minimalists of two generations - Steve
Reich and Michael Torke - along with one of the classic pieces by the great
American impressionist, George Crumb, in a concert at the RSAMD.
The Tramway will host the first visit to Glasgow of the acclaimed Circle in the
Square Theatre company. Based in New York's Lincoln Center, the founder company
of ``off-Broadway'' with more than 185 productions in its 45-year history, and
the winner of a Tony Award in 1976 for outstanding achievement, Circle in the
Square Theatre is bringing to the American Festival five performances of
Tennessee Williams's claustrophobic drama, Suddenly Last Summer.
The Royal Concert Hall will house its biggest art exhibition to date, The
Promised Land, featuring 60 paintings by the Scottish painter Ian Cook based on
his research into the life of contemporary indigenous American Indians. The art
exhibition will run from early January.
There will be a complementary season of American films screened at the GFT.
This will include On The Town, Manhattan, West Side Story, and New York, New
York.
The orchestral core to the festival takes the concept of collaboration - the
buzz word on the music scene today - one step further than previous
partnerships. Rather than individual contributions, coupled to make a pair, the
RSNO/SCO input was conceived as an entity. To that end, and to give it an
authentic touch, an American music director - conductor Andrew Litton - was
appointed to be in charge of the whole project, as well as conducting both
orchestras himself.
Other conductors and soloists featuring are almost all American too, including
Marin Allsop, pupil of Bernstein and music director of the Colorado Symphony,
John McGlinn, specialist conductor of Broadway and American musicals, and Yoel
Levi, music director of the Atlanta Symphony.
``When you do this kind of thing, with programmes that tend to be more
adventurous, it is a risk relying on ticket sales,'' said Paul Hughes, chief
executive of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. ``So for all those who
complain that we do the same old stuff all of the time, now's their chance to
turn up in droves.''
Hughes said he is generally happy with the way the programme has been put
together by himself, Roy McEwan, managing director of the SCO, and conductor
Andrew Litton. His one particular disappointment is that a staged version of an
American musical - rumour had it to be Singin' in the Rain - which was planned
for the King's Theatre - fell through.
If the festival works - and in today's completely unpredictable climate nobody
is prepared to guarantee a sure-fire, razzle-dazzle, American- style success at
the box office - it is a formula that will be up for further collaborative
investigation.
Paradoxically, the one form of music absent from the festival is perhaps the
most uniquely American and indigenous of all - jazz. Paul Hughes said that
there had been some discussion early on with jazz promoters, Assembly Direct,
though nothing had materialised. ``And for our first stab at something like
this, we wanted to keep it to a manageable size,'' said Hughes.
He agreed he'd be delighted to see any independent initiative from within
Glasgow's burgeoning jazz scene - from the Glasgow Jazz Coop to Pizza Express,
the Ramshorn, and a range of pubs - happening at the same time as the festival.
Brochures for the American Festival, which is being presented in association
with The Herald, sponsored by BA and Hilton Hotels, with funding from the
Department of Performing Arts and the Scottish Arts Council, will be available
this week. There is a new direct line service for obtaining a brochure: 0141
305 7000.

SO this is how it goes: you say ``to-may-to'', I say tomato, and then before we
know it we are expelling the usual accumulated resentments and spite of any
relationship by having a big barney about whether or not it's a fruit.
At some point I will realise I'm wrong but by then my heels will be dug in so
deep I won't be able to make a U-turn, so I'll craftily try to deflect the
argument and bring up avocados instead and next thing it'll just get daft and
I'll be insisting bananas are vetegables too, so I'll have to get out of that
one by going into a sulk and refusing to speak because that way I won't have to
say that I was wrong.
Because of course you'll be right. Because you're a man, and you know these
kind of things, because while we girls were developing valuable social skills
like how to repair runs in our ecru tights with burgundy nail varnish you were
all sitting around swallowing reference books in preparation for a future when
you could triumph in pointless arguments.
Honestly, the things you lot know, from the grazing habits of antelopes to the
fact that glass is a liquid to recitations of the name of every past Prime
Minster.
You don't just know the scores of football matches which took place before you
were born, you know the crowd capacities too. Why do you clog your brains up
with this sort of stuff? Do you do it just to irritate the hell out of us?
Well, congratulations. It works. It bugs us to bits. And don't bother getting
all smug about it. It's not big and it's not clever.
Boy, do we hate it and, boy, do you lot know we hate it and, boy, do you lot
love it that we hate it - but not because we're secretly so impressed that it
makes us choked up with jealousy. Nope, we hate it because if your heads are
full of all those pointless facts then there won't be any space left for the
really important stuff. That's the stuff about us.
I mean, that brain cell of yours dedicated to remembering that the capital of
Mongolia is Ulan Bator should have been reserved for memorising what record was
playing the first time you ever danced with us, the cell you use for
remembering the exact date Abraham Lincoln was assassinated should have been
saved up for remembering our birthdays.
One of the most marked differences between the way men and women think has to
be the way we use our memories. Women just don't know all that Rivers of the
World stuff unless we happen to be geographers or have too many brothers.
There's simply no need to.
It's a matter of prioritising. We pitch our energies into remembering deep and
meaningful stuff, like every utterance of that conversation we had with you
two-and-a-half years ago on the way to the shops on a Sunday morning. Now, that
kind of stuff might seem trivial to you but we know that it's potentially
useful.
Some chance remark of yours can be carefully stored in our armoury then wielded
like a weapon in some future spat. We'll wait until your defences are down -
ie, like when you're asleep - then wake you up to stab you in the head with it.
We fear that you're not paying us enough attention. This is why we get so
incensed when you do something like bring us a can of Sprite for our lunch,
even though we once told you that we don't like Sprite very much, and we can
see through your mock innocence and fake grievance, all that ``for Heaven's
sake, I was only doing you a favour, how can you expect me to remember
something like that?'' because we know it's calculated.
WE know that you don't remember all the things about ourselves that we told you
and which were supposed to be chiselled into your skull because you have
deliberately remembered something else instead, like how many bronze medals
Tunisia picked up at the Los Angeles Olympics.
I mean, it's hardly surprising we get all hot and bothered when we realise that
Tunisia's sporting achievements have a greater hold on your heart than our soft
drink preferences. It's such a betrayal.
These are some of the things you never remember about us; you don't remember
the name of our best friend at primary school; you don't remember that we've
had the chickenpox before, we told you once, we had it when we were six; you
don't remember that we don't like anchovies on pizzas; you don't remember that
we are allergic to elderflowers; you don't remember that we prefer tulips to
carnations; you don't remember that we don't like films by Stephen King, so how
could you possibly suggest going to see one? Jeez, how many times do we have to
tell you? Don't you ever listen to anything we say?
This is the crux of the problem. Men polish enough social skills to know that
the way to ensnare a woman is to ask her lots of questions about herself at the
beginning of a relationship. And women, deluded fools that we are, are so
gratified and complimented by this attention that we don't even notice that
they don't actually listen to the replies.
We find out later. That's when the wars start. And I didn't know what the
capital of Mongolia is. I looked it up. Don't bother writing in about Tunisia
at the Olympics: it won't impress me.

A WARNING accompanies the play which opens at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow
tonight - audiences should know that Penetrator ``contains disturbing
pornographic language and sexual imagery which some may find offensive''.
There is some irony in the fact that while this caution might put some people
off it will almost certainly act as enticement for others, those bored with
bland fare looking for drama which tackles the darker side of life.
Drama doesn't come much darker than this. Written by the young London-based
Scottish writer Anthony Neilson, Penetrator documents in harrowing detail a
confrontation between two young men and their childhood friend, an army
deserter who arrives at their flat and discloses a catalogue of ritual abuse he
has suffered.
It's an explicit and violent play which has divided critical opinion, both in
Scotland where it premiered on the Fringe two years ago and in London at the
Royal Court, but which has also generated a buzz, with a sell-out run in London.
Like the stage production of Trainspotting, Penetrator both articulates the
concerns of a young audience and addresses that group. Peter Mackie Burns,
visiting director at the Tron was attracted to the play because Neilson is not
afraid to tackle the taboo.
``It deals with an area which is never really talked about among men -
exploring not only our sexual desires but also our blackest sexual fears. It
deals with how men really are rather than how they should be.''
So, is this a play for the loaded generation. Drama for the lads? ``Yeh,
definitely, although I reckon loaded's too testosterone charged. I hate to use
a real buzz word but it's about the slacker generation, about chaps like myself.
``There are loads of people in my age group - late twenties - who've been to
college and who are well educated but who haven't really got a career off the
ground and who are preoccupied with just hanging out and getting into the club
scene.
``In Penetrator we have two characters who live together and who spend their
time finding new ways to divert themselves.''
They are guys who are hip to pop culture and literate in advertising semantics
and Mackie Burns has stressed the play's contemporaneousness by updating some
of the cultural references.
``I've changed some stuff like remarks about the Gulf War. Anthony's not at all
precious about dialogue because he's more concerned with structure. He hasn't
been involved in the production, he's left me to shoot myself in the foot. The
only instruction he gave was `make sure the knive is big'.''
An ominous remark that stresses the brutality afoot? ``Yes, it is violent but
there's also loads of humour. For me the shocking aspect of Penetrator is not
the violence or the elements of pornography but the fact that these people are
jettisoned into confronting things they'd really rather avoid. There's a
compulsion towards things they find repellent.''
Somewhat surprisingly, given the confrontational nature of the play, the
rehearsals have been pretty laid back.
Mackie Burns has replicated the naturalistic set of a lads' flat in the
rehearsal room and he, John Kazek, Joel Strachan, and Paul Blair have been
doing a lot of loafing around on sofas.
Mackie Burns and Michael Boyd, artistic director at the Tron, hope the
production will win Nielson some recognition on his home turf. Despite his low
profile on the Scottish scene he's very much in demand down south, writing for
television drama series like Prime Suspect and Cracker, although his writing is
often deemed too provocative for television.
Another side to Neilson's work will be showcased soon at the Tron as part of
their Four Scottish Writers short season when Boyd will direct a
work-in-progress presentation of a new play be Neilson, The Love We Find
Ourselves, about a celebrated film director returning to Scotland.

VODAFONE, Britain's largest mobile telephone network operator, yesterday said
its first-half profits rose 12% but said the average revenue per subscriber in
the UK fell.
The number of its subscribers worldwide increased by 66% to 2.6 million. The
growth rate exceeded the 57% gain in subscribers reported in the same period
last year.
Vodafone's pre-tax profits for the period that ended on September 30 rose to
#208.1m from #186.4m a year ago. Turnover increased to #666.4m from #560.7m.
The company also raised its dividend by 20% to 1.97p per share.
The shares fell 15p to 239p on heavy volume of nearly 36 million despite
results broadly in line with market forecasts.
Analysts had expected Vodafone to report pre-tax profits in a range of #205m to
#225m.
The company reported an improving contribution from its businesses outside
Britain as its operations in Greece, France, and South Africa moved into
operating profits.
In Britain, net connections in the six months to September 30 rose to 372,000
from 263,000 a year ago, and the number of subscribers rose to 2.2 million. Of
total subscribers, one million are on Vodafone's LowCall tariff and 325,000 are
on its digital network.
But the average revenue per subscriber has fallen due to an increasing
proportion of LowCall customers and the range of tariffs. The churn rate, or
rate of disconnections, fell to 24.9% from 28.5%. - Reuter

THE consumate deal maker John Ritblat continues to show his sure touch. His
British Land is taking control of the huge Broadgate office development
adjacent to London's Liverpool Street Station for a total of #920m. That
includes the expected purchase price, which may have to be altered depending on
the taxation complexities, and the assumption of #800m of debt.
British Land is also buying three Scottish retail warehouse parks and seven
Tesco superstores in England and Wales which will cost #148m and have a
combined initial rent roll of #10.7m.
This is one of the biggest ever series of deals on one day, totalling #1068m.
British Land's John Weston Smith would not reveal the identity of the vendor of
the Scottish properties. These are the Springfield Retail Park in Elgin,
Dumbarton's St James's Retail Park and the Auldhouse Retail Park on Nether
Auldhouse Road in Glasgow.
One attraction is that as well as having prime covenant tenants such as
ScottishPower and Currys, they have five-year upwards-only rent reviews.
The Tesco deal adds to the existing 90 or so supermarkets that British Land has
bought and rented out to the retail giants, including 46 to J Sainsbury and 39
to Somerfield. The advantage is that not only are they let on a basis of
upwards-only rent, but they also offer either a guaranteed formula increase or
market rate, whichever is higher.
The Tesco superstores will increase from their current acquisition price yield
of 7% to 9.4% minimum in 2000.
The net effect is that 22% of the #4600m portfolio is now upwards-only in terms
of rental income, by far the highest percentage of all the major property
companies.
Broadgate is being acquired from the receiver of crashed Rosehaugh and brings
about full control of properties amounting to about two million square feet.
Broadgate itself at 1.5 million sq ft is obtaining #30 per sq ft, although
Ludgate, a newer development two miles away to the west of St Paul's Cathedral,
still has rent-free periods.
That may well be sold to help reduce British Land's gearing which is well over
100% even after yesterday's placing and open offer to raise #223m. The terms of
the offer are one new share at 370p for every six held.
British Land has forecast that its interim dividend will rise at least 5.3% to
2.78p and will be payable on the 61.6 million new shares being issued. The
existing shares fell 14p to 381p.

A BLISTERING row has broken out over estate agents' advertisements which offer
low-cost legal fees.
Over the last 12 months some of Scotland's most prominent agents have been
offering their clients cut-rate conveyancing - often as low as #250 or #285 per
transaction, no matter what the value of the house.
But in a hitherto unreported move, the Law Society of Scotland stepped in on
September 21 and instructed its members to obey a new set of ``practice rules''
which have inflamed some estate agents.
From the beginning of this month, any solicitor whose services are advertised
by a third party (such as an estate agent) must ensure that those adverts
comply with these new rules - even if the solicitor is not named in the ad.
The key change demands that all ads must give ``equal prominence'' to VAT and
other outlays as to the actual fee. The new rules also say ads should not
compare fees with those of any other solicitor and that they must also present
the full range of charges, not just the lowest.
Breach of any of the rules in an estate agent's ad may be treated as
professional misconduct by the solicitor who is retained to do the work, even
when the solictor is not named.
The Law Society argues that these rules protect clients by making it clear that
prices can be higher than the lowest fee quoted. But David Alves of Edinburgh
agents Stewart Saunders says it is simply an attempt to bolster the solicitors'
grip on conveyancing at a time when their monopoly is about to be broken by the
introduction of ``licensed conveyancers'' into the Scottish market.
``Estate agents were pilloried by solicitors last year when we introduced lower
legal fees and destroyed the cosy cartel they enjoyed. All of a sudden lots of
adverts are appearing offering low-cost conveyancing and some solicitors don't
like it.
``They are the only service providers who prefer not to tell you their charges
before you buy. We've all got to provide a service at a price which the public
can afford. Why should solicitors be protected from the realities of the
marketplace?''
Estate agents Allen &amp; Harris pioneered low-cost conveyancing offers in the west
of Scotland, but have been hit by the rule changes. ``We had to withdraw our
adverts from The Herald for the last three weeks until we could draw up a
wording acceptable to the Law Society,'' says John Hinshelwood of Allen &amp;
Harris. ``Some solicitors are trying to make it as difficult as possible to
advertise low-cost conveyancing in the press, but it won't work. The public
wants this service.''
Solicitor Stephen Gold, a major Glasgow provider of low-cost conveyancing, says
he is happy to comply with the new rules. ``There is a minority element in the
legal profession who would rather not see competition. But that is not the Law
Society's position or that of most sensible practitioners.''
Grant McCulloch, vice president of the Law Society for Scotland, says his
organisation is simply fulfilling its duty to protect the public. ``We've seen
some estate agents' advertisements which we believe are misleading about legal
fees. We would sort out any solicitor who ran such ads, so we are saying to any
estate agent who advertises legal services that they, too, will now have to
deal with us.''
He went on to refute allegations that solicitors are merely trying to keep
conveyancing fees artificially high. ``There is a growing concern that fees are
getting too low. It is in the public interest to have a fair fee for a fair
job. Many clients now ask for fee quotes before instructing a solicitor and
that's fine. What we don't want is client choice being decided by third party
adverts or cost alone.''
Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, chief executive of the National Association of Estate
Agents, said that his organisation would be taking a close look at the changes.
``The new rules may be innocuous, but if we detect any attempt by the
solicitors to boost the cost of conveyancing, or if it appears to be a
restrictive practice, we'll refer the matter to the Office of Fair Trading.''

STEPHEN O'NEILL is one of the newer people in the West of Scotland rental
scene, with decided views about the business. And he's not afraid to put his
money where his mouth is.
``What I'm looking at is an academic study by university housing research
specialists,'' he says. ``This is a business where you must have a good grasp
of the whole market: where it was, where it is, and where it is going.
``I believe there is a great need for true objective research to bring out all
the relevant information. This is my first research sponsorship and I'm looking
for a start early next year.
``I want to know about rents, and the growth in levels. About tenant profiles.
About the condition of the property stock. The effect on rental of existing
government regulations. The reciprocal effect of rented housing and the
economy. That kind of thing.
``This is simply a case of taking a businesslike approach to what I see as an
important business.''
He sees nothing out of the way in perceiving would-be first-time buyers as
potential tenants.
``They are just not buying right off,'' he points out. ``They are deciding to
defer that decision. They have housing needs, of course, and the rented sector
answers them.
``They can enjoy a healthy income nowadays, and these days their first actual
purchase is what would once have been their second or even third.''
O'Neill's portfolio indicates the kind of properties his clients find of
interest now.
There's a former weaver's cottage, for example, in the conservation village of
Carmunnock. A studio-type cottage, unfurnished, with a large lounge/bedroom,
fitted kitchen and bathroom. Gas central heating. Letting at #320 a month.
Homely, and handy for commuting.
Or a modern terraced property in Shieldhall, handy for the M8. Also convenient
for the Southern General, come to that. Furnished, with two bedrooms,
good-sized lounge, fitted kitchen and bathroom. Not too large a garden. All for
#425 a month.
Alternatively, there's a flat at the Waterfront, a popular area: on the bank of
the Clyde, handy for the city centre. Lounge/dining room, bedroom, kitchen and
bathroom. Central heating, french windows, and parking space. For #375 a month.
Go to Hyndland and you can pay a bit more - such as #600 a month for a flat.
Lounge, dining room, kitchen, two bedrooms, and bathroom. Electric central
heating. Ready at the turn of the year.

Promising outlook
for future growth
AGAINST the positive trends, Ayrshire has suffered from a reputation as an
unemployment blackspot, and places like Cumnock and Doon Valley still have
their problems. But the good news is that there are encouraging signs.
Enterprise Ayrshire, which pumped over #27m into the development of Ayrshire's
economy last year, has targeted Cumnock and Doon Valley and Ardrossan,
Saltcoats, and Stevenston in a Three Towns initiative.
By working closely with the private and public sectors, Enterprise Ayrshire's
activities are expected to lever additional investment of #40m and to create or
safeguard over 4000 jobs over the next three years.
In fact, unemployment in Ayrshire fell by over 10% (2200) last year (and since
the beginning of 1993 by as much as 5700), with business exports up by over
20%. At #2000m per annum the exports represent 16% of the Scottish total, which
is double the contribution which might be expected from a local economy the
size of Ayrshire.
``The thing we are all working towards,'' said David Macdonald, chief executive
of Enterprise Ayrshire, ``is the performance of the Ayrshire economy and the
employment opportunities for Ayrshire residents which flow from that economic
performance.''
Enterprise Ayrshire has a plan for the economy which confirms the county's role
as a leading contributor to the current and future competitiveness of Scotland.
This involves a partnership with the public and private sectors to create a
business environment in which companies will wish to locate, bringing
prosperity and quality employment for all Ayrshire people.
According to Barry Allen, chairman of Enterprise Ayrshire, the plan involves
building on Ayrshire's economic strengths and opportunities, addressing the
needs of the county, and helping to sustain existing competitive advantage and
realise the potential for competitive growth.
As for urban regeneration, Enterprise Ayrshire has undertaken three major
projects: Kilmarnock and Ayr town centres and a #30m development at the Ayr
Citadel site. The refurbishment and preparatory works are intended to provide
further economic development opportunities by attracting business and
associated jobs.
Over the past two years, Kilmarnock town centre has benefited from a range of
environmental improvements. The regeneration project, which is scheduled for
completion next year, is costing #8m, with the bulk of the funds provided by
Enterprise Ayrshire and Kilmarnock and Loudoun District Council with help from
the European Regional Development Fund.
Looking to the future, Enterprise Ayrshire has also submitted its 1996/99
strategy to Scottish Enterprise. The document, Challenge for the Millennium,
presents a strong case for Ayrshire and its plan for growth, and seeks
resources of #28.9m.
Next year Ayrshire will be the focus of worldwide attention when the county
pays tribute to its most famous son.
Marking the bicentenary of the death of Robert Burns, the Burns International
Festival '96 will be a year-long celebration of the man, his life, and his work.
Hundreds of events are planned, and it is hoped that the international
attention generated will benefit industry and Ayrshire as a whole.

SOME of the most interesting properties in Lanarkshire are to be found in
Dalzell House, a listed mansion converted into apartments in the mid-1980s.
The conversion was carried out by Classical House, the developers who
specialise in restoring important historic buildings. Standing above a
waterfall on the Dalzell Burn on the outskirts of Motherwell, the house was
enlarged and extended in the middle of the last century - but connections with
the Dalzell family can be traced back to the tenth century.
Now agent Slater Hogg &amp; Howison is marketing a three-bedroom mews which forms
part of the house. Features such as crowstep gables, a cobbled courtyard and a
unique crystal window add to its attraction, and it also has modern features
such as patio doors on to the courtyard, a gallery, white-meter heating, and a
single garage.
Apart from the bedrooms, the accommodation consists of a lounge with vaulted
ceiling, fitted kitchen, family bathroom, and guest cloakroom. There is a small
private garden - and parking facilities. Offers over #129,000 are sought.

A LEADING Scottish builder is offering to pay its new customers' mortgages for
a full year; but bargain-hunters will have to move fast. The offer - available
at all Miller Homes developments in Scotland, from Ayr in the West to Gullane
in the East, subject to status - closes in mid-December.
``It is quite simply the best deal on the market,'' claims Lindsay Gilchrist,
West of Scotland sales manager for Miller Homes, the UK's biggest
privately-owned home-builder.
``There are no hidden catches with this package - it simply means that Miller
Homes will pay your mortgage for one year. And after the first year, the
customer will start paying the standard variable rate mortgage.
``The package also means the new home-owners will be able to reduce their
borrowing and money which would otherwise have been spent on paying the
mortgage can be used to decorate and furnish their new home. This process,
which can usually take a long time to complete, can also be done in a much
shorter timescale.''
The free-mortgage-for-one-year package has been negotiated by Miller Homes in
conjunction with insurance brokers the WH partnership and a national lender.
The offer applies to all Miller Homes customers for settlement before December
15 this year.
Meanwhile, the variety of homes available at Miller's development in
Canniesburn, Glasgow, has been extended by the introduction of townhouses. The
houses have been especially designed to complement the natural features of
their location in Canniesburn Place, according to Lindsay Gilchrist.
Each of the townhouses has two public rooms, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a
garage and a balcony. Natural light floods into the properties through the
three split levels and through the integral conservatory. Prices start at
#145,000.
``Different people have different needs and hopefully the variety of homes
available at Canniesburn Place will appeal to a lot of prospective customers,''
says Lindsay Gilchrist. Also available at Canniesburn Place are two-and
three-bedroom flats, with prices starting from #85,000, which offer a lounge,
an en-suite shower room and kitchens equipped with a double oven and gas or
electric hob. These flats also have a security door entry system.

MILLER-Bellway has reduced the price of a three-bedroom linked detached home at
its Oakridge development in Paisley to #45,750.
Irene Glassey, sales manager for Miller Partnerships, says: ``Currently, we
have a promotion running called Price Fighter. This means that purchasers can
make valuable savings on a limited number of properties at Oakridge if they
move quickly.
``As the houses are linked at the garage, buyers are actually being offered a
detached house for the price of a semi."

MODERN communications and transport links have greatly enhanced the appeal of
Ayrshire as a place to put down your roots, particularly for those commuting to
Glasgow and the Central Belt.
Perhaps the biggest boost is the on-going construction of the six-mile M77
through the South Side of Glasgow at a cost of #53.6m. The new road starts at
the Haggs Castle roundabout and joins the A77, the main link between Ayrshire
and Glasgow, at Malletsheugh, south of Newton Mearns.
Although there is no timescale as yet, the Scottish Office has a ``general
plan'' to extend the M77 and upgrade the rest of the A77 between Glasgow and
Ayr.
Such improvements will greatly cut commuting time and vastly improve prospects
for economic development in Ayrshire.
ScotRail runs a half-hourly service on the Ayr line to Glasgow and an hourly
service, augmented at peak times, on the Largs branch. Meanwhile the opening of
the railway station at Prestwick Airport has further boosted the latter's
revival. The airport suffered badly with the introduction of the Open Skies
policy in 1991, when it lost its role as the sole transatlantic gateway into
Scotland.
Since PIK took over Prestwick from British Airports, however, many of the
buildings have been refurbished, flexible working has been introduced, and the
railway station has been built and linked to the terminal building. Much new
business is now coming in, and the airport has enjoyed record passenger traffic
this year.
Last summer, the low costs at Prestwick and an enterprising operator, Ryanair,
produced a new scheduled service between Prestwick and Dublin, at very much
lower fares than the existing services from Abbotsinch. It was immediately a
great success. The same operator has now introduced a four-times-a-day service
to London Stansted, slashing fares, which start at just #59 return, rising to a
fully flexible ticket at #99, compared with a range of #74 to #234 from the
established Anglo-Scottish carriers.
Only a week ago, Sir Freddie Laker announced he is forming a new airline and
associated travel companies, and returning to Prestwick Airport after an
absence of 14 years. He plans to offer 14-day holidays in Florida next summer.
The airport is also enjoying a growing reputation as a freight hub, which can
only be good for the local economy.
And if you don't fancy flying, the nearby ferry port of Stranraer provides a
link with Northern Ireland.

ALTHOUGH the value of the average house in Scotland fell by 0.8% in the three
months to the end of October 1995, the Scottish house market ``is displaying
its traditional strengths'' according to the TSB's latest quarterly index.
Compared with the same quarter in 1994, the index is now showing a fall of 3%.
The bank says that these latest figures confirm a static price trend in
Scotland over the last two years. Volumes of new mortgages are down in this
quarter compared with the previous one, and significantly down on the same
quarter one year ago.
However, the TSB is upbeat about the market's prospects. ``There is good
evidence from first-time buyer participation and price-to-earnings figures of
underlying strength in the market,'' says the report. That optimism comes from
a breakdown of buying trends by sector. Although the average price paid by
first-time buyers is downwards (some 6.7% lower for the first three quarters of
this year compared with the same period last year) the average price paid by
non-first time buyers is actually going up.
Reflecting their power to keep prices down, more first-time buyers are now
emerging into the market. Meanwhile, the average cost of a house compared to
average earnings is 2.7, comfortably in the middle of a range which went as low
as 2.4 in 1987 and as high as 3.0 at the end of 1991.
The bank's statistics also show a sharp increase in consumer credit (personal
loans and overdrafts) over the whole of this year. ``These figures confirm the
confidence of Scottish consumers in borrowing for the future despite much
publicity about the lack of feel-good factor,'' says the TSB report.
The bank's analysts conclude that the Scottish house market is stable, prices
are static, and activity is lower than one year ago. But first-time buyers are
active and houses are priced at an affordable level - all signs of the
traditional strengths in the Scottish market.
Meanwhile, the picture is looking rosier South of the Border, according to the
latest residential market trends from the National Association of Estate
Agents. An improvement which first showed itself in London and the South-east
is now spreading out to the South-west, Midlands, North-west and Northern
England.
October's figures are the most optimistic produced by the NAEA over the last
two years. Agents report an increase in the number of inquiries, property
viewings, and offers during the month. If the Chancellor takes positive action
in his Budget to help home owners and the property market in next week's
Budget, ``there is no reason why this tentative recovery should not continue,''
says Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, chief executive of the NAEA.
An improving market could also tempt people more people to put their homes up
for sale. A lack of supply has been dampening the UK market as a whole for the
last year.
