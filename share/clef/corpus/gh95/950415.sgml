Ginger Hill, 1 Hillhead Street, Milngavie. Tel: 0141 956 6515.
FAST food and junk food do not need to mean the same thing. Today, the
notion of ''fast food'' carries with it the negative implications of
burgers in buns and skinny chips in cardboard boxes. In fact, fast food
can range from a healthy sandwich packed with salad to a quickly
prepared bowl of pasta in a simple tomato sauce.
Eating on the hoof is sometimes unavoidable, and the beauty of fast
food joints, if there is any beauty in them at all, is the speed with
which you are served, eat, and get out again. The surroundings are
pleasant enough, but they are not really the sort of place in which many
people stay for long.
Generally, if you are eating out, you do want to linger. You want good
food in comfortable surroundings, with the evening winding on until you
feel ready to face the world again. At Ginger Hill, in Milngavie, just
outside Glasgow, there is no rushing. When I arrived, the waitress asked
if I was in a hurry, then advised that as everything is prepared to
order, the meal was not going to be served too quickly.
Ginger Hill is at the bottom of a steep hill at the top of a small
flight of stone steps; it is a lot like arriving at a friend's house for
dinner. To get to the dining-room, you pass the busy, small kitchen, the
packed coat-stand, and move in the direction of chattering voices.
This is the smallest restaurant I have ever been in. Initially, it
felt cramped and uncomfortable. The waitress had to squeeze her way
around, but seemed to be practised at this so nothing was spilled and
no-one was bumped.
The dining-room is, in fact, two rooms. The larger houses around 18
seats, the smaller has two tables of four. The decor is muted; the walls
are pale blue, but the large pictures hanging on them look out of place.
Some of the pictures depict billiards tables and check machines, while
the others are floral prints. There is no recurring theme, just like
many people's front rooms. A hatch in the wall allows you to see into
the kitchen -- always entertaining.
The restaurant is a bring-your-own-bottle operation, which you are
warned of when you book. Just in case you do forget the liquid
accompaniment, complimentary sparkling water is served.
When I booked the table, I was told it was the last one. We have all
heard that before, but in this case it proved to be true, courtesy of a
large party of ladies who appeared to be celebrating and taking up a
large chunk of the restaurant, making it seem even more claustrophobic.
The food kicked off with an appetiser of very fresh, chunky vegetables
and a grainy mustard-dressing dip, which was delicious. As I munched my
way through, I perused the menu: a familiar cast, including salmon,
prawns, sole, and fillet steak. There was also a good choice of
vegetarian dishes. There are also daily specials on offer, and on this
occasion they included mussels, scallops, and monkfish.
I decided to start with avocado vinaigrette, and from my seat I
watched the chef slice the fruit in the tiny kitchen. The grainy
dressing was good, just the right amount of oil and vinegar, and the
mustard gave it the required ''kick''. The salad was less interesting,
comprising the usual combination of carrots, lettuce, peppers, and
tomatoes.
I struggled to make a choice from the main-course menu. The waitress
advised that the kitchen could rustle something up for me, if there was
nothing I fancied. My difficulty was not that there was nothing I liked,
simply that there was too much that I did like. I decided on the
vegetable crepe, with the proviso that the vegetables were served in a
tomato-based sauce, rather than a cream one. I was assured that this is
how it is always presented at Ginger Hill.
We waited quite some time for our main courses. The kitchen was
obviously working on the principle ''first come first served''. We had
been third in, so we had to wait behind the large group of ladies and a
table made up of two couples. But at least this meant the food would be
fresh.
Thankfully, the meal was worth waiting for. The portion was huge. The
large crepe was stuffed full of fresh vegetables in a spicy, tomato
sauce. There were onions, mushrooms, carrots, and peppers, all crisp to
the taste. The crepe was light and made with a herb mixture that
complemented the sauce wonderfully.
Vegetables were served separately and consisted of potatoes and
carrots. Simply served, and very well cooked.
As I wound my way through the main course, the noise in the room
reached a fever pitch. It was not that the large party were a bunch of
raucous ladies on a wild night out, merely that in such a small room
even the tiniest whisper could be heard by everyone.
Dessert calmed things down a little. I always maintain that the sign
of a good dessert is a silent table. This wasn't quite the case, but the
indicators still suggested a treat in store.
Puddings included sticky toffee pavlova, lemon meringue pie, white
chocolate cheesecake, and various flavours of ice cream. Struggling
between the ginger and melon ice-cream and cheesecake, I ordered a
little of each.
The ice-cream was wonderful; the spiciness of the ginger came through
well, followed by the refreshing tang of melon. The white chocolate
cheesecake was less memorable. Delicately flavoured, topped with
shavings of white chocolate and whipped cream, it was spoiled by the
dribble of bitter chocolate sauce.
The menu was pricey, main courses ranging from around #7 for a
vegetarian course to #16 for fish. I was shocked by how much was asked
for my vegetable crepe -- #9.50. But I was angry that I had been charged
for two puddings. I had asked for small pieces of each and had expected
to only pay for one, or at least a small supplement for the ice-cream.
Flexibility appeared to be the catchword at Ginger Hill, so I was
disappointed at the extra charge. I was also surprised at the price of
some of the specials -- #15.95 for monkfish thermidor is expensive.
Ginger Hill is an enjoyable place to eat, the food is good and very
fresh, service is friendly and informal. But watch out for the prices.
* Ginger Hill is open for lunch Monday to Saturday and for dinner
Thursday to Saturday. Lunch is served between 11.30am and 2.30pm. The
menu is less formal and includes sandwiches, baked potatoes, soup, etc.
Dinner is served from 7pm. Three courses from the a la carte menu in the
evening cost around #20 a head.

HE began as a bookie's runner, became a bookie and a runner, but if
that does not entitle Bert Logan to a place among Scotland's sporting
rarities, he also played for Motherwell and Berwick Rangers.
In his time, this amiable bookie (and, for me at least, that is not
the easiest phrase to put together) also has been a joiner, apprentice
baker, and delivery van driver, who has found time to be Hearts' sprint
coach, and is a seven-handicap golfer. His is the kind of career that
makes the rest of us feel slothful, but he would be the first to admit
that it is his nature to be doing something.
That had seemed certain, at least in his mind, to be professional
football. He left school at 15 convinced that he would be a success as a
pro and, in fact, still talks in a kind of modest bewilderment that he
did not make it. He joined Motherwell in 1963, signed by Bobby Ancell,
but was freed in 1964 when he joined Berwick under Jock Wallace.
After a year there, Bert faced up to the realities and turned his
thoughts elsewhere to make a career. ''I had served my time as a joiner,
after packing in after a year as an apprentice baker, and had got
married. I said to Anne: I am going to be a bookmaker.''
It may not have been the most obvious of alternative choices for a
joiner/footballer, but gambling had been part of the Logan family psyche
in Tranent for a long time. His older brother owned a betting shop, but
Bert decided he would go it alone with the same conviction that had
earlier produced the declaration that he would make it as a footballer.
He is not one of life's pessimists, is Bert, but even he had to dredge
up fighting spirit from a long way down when he tried to get a living
calling the odds at the dog tracks.
He and his lifelong friend, former world professional sprint champion
George McNeill, along with another friend, put #100 each in a pool to
start the bookie firm. ''We were called Field Enterprises, with me as
the licence-holder. We went to Tranent dogs.''
He lasted two weeks before he was broke. That was enough for the other
two, neither of whom was a natural gambler, but Logan takes a lot of
shaking off. ''I was not for chucking it. The biggest disappointment in
my life was not making it as a footballer and I was not prepared to take
any more.''
He persevered. ''The only way you learn bookmaking is by losing. You
learn the lessons quickly.'' He had never given up being a joiner, doing
his bookie stint part-time, but then joined his brother and became a
bookie's runner round the building sites of Penicuik. He collected the
workers' lines . . . ''I was comfortable in that environment, where I
had spent five years as an apprentice.''
He did that for two or three years, combining the joinery with the
alternative career, but then he and his two other brothers decided they
would become bookies in their own right. They are still in business.
Yet Bert was not too popular with his new partners as he continued to
lose on the tracks, while the betting shop in Newtongrange did all
right. ''I just wouldn't give in, even if none of them wanted me to keep
doing it. But I always felt that it would be a flagship for us to be
seen on the racecourses. To me, betting shop proprietors are not real
bookmakers, the guys who put up their prices and display their wares.''
After four years of almost uninterrupted losing on the tracks, Bert
found money so tight that he took a job driving a van for Sunblest. He
did that from 6.30am till noon, then went to the betting shop until
5.30, and straight to the dog track till 10 at night.
''I lasted a year at that and was exhausted, but I did manage to get
out of trouble. I got a wage from Sunblest that helped make up for
losing at the track.''
It was about six years after trying that he felt he was at last a
bookmaker. He had come through some private despondency en route. ''I
can remember walking the sands at Port Seton at two in the morning
trying to gather myself, trying to convince myself I wasn't going to
fail at this as well.'' He insists that the money was not the motivating
force . . . ''I started with nothing and I still have it'' . . . but the
powerful determination not to fail was very much behind his blind
refusal to abandon play.
He also had a family to consider, two daughters, Kirsty Anne, who is
23, and Lee who is 20, lived in a council house in Tranent, but by now,
the mid-seventies, he felt he was beginning to get there.
It was not long after that a new dimension was to be added to the
Logan ambitions. He became a runner. At 34, Bert decided to be a
sprinter.
''George McNeill had been a few times to Australia and I fancied going
there, too. I said so to my wife, but she said: 'He is a sprinter.' So I
knocked on George's door and told him I wanted to be a runner.''
He had not been especially fast as a footballer, but had watched
George training and competing for some time. ''He gave me a pair of
spikes and I turned up on January 8, 1980, at Meadowbank. I became
hooked on the training and the desire to lose weight -- I was 14st at
the time.'' Two years later he was 11st 12lb and won the British Classic
at Powderhall, collecting #4000. ''That was a great satisfaction, to win
in front of the Powderhall punters who knew me well.''
One of his fellow bookies, Ricky Nelson, who once played for Edinburgh
Wanderers, recalls challenging the new sprinter to a race outside the
front door of Powderhall. ''He beat me half a yard over 50 metres up the
road. We raced for #20 and I also lost #100 toa punter. That was his
first win.''
He won various sprints at Highland Games over 100 and 200 metres. He
soon went regularly to Melbourne, the reason it all began. When he was
41 he ran in the world veteran championship. ''It was a big day for me
to run against George at levels. Usually I was handicapped and he always
sucked me in. George was world class whereas I was average. I got it
down to about six yards of a start against him.
''I ran seventh in the final and George was second, but for me that
was very special, the highlight of my sprinting career.''
He ran professionally for about 10 years and then concentrated on the
coaching side along with McNeill, whose win in the Stawell Gift race in
Australia remains the biggest thrill that his pal has experienced. ''We
coached Willie Fraser to win the Powderhall Sprint and Neil Sneddon to
win the same race.''
Then, in 1984, Hearts vice-chairman Pilmar Smith, a fellow bookie,
asked him and George to help out in speed and fitness training with the
players. ''George packed in, but I am still doing it. I have become a
real Hearts fan and I can't tell you how gutted I felt when I saw the
lads lose in that semi-final last week.''
He would cite former Tynecastle man Scott Crabbe as the man who made
the biggest improvement from sprint coaching. ''He ran like his name
suggested, but he did really well once he got started. The best overall
athlete I have seen at the club is undoubtedly Craig Levein. John
Colquhoun and Gary Mackay also came on well for the coaching.
''To be honest, when we went first to Tynecastle we were surprised at
how relatively unfit footballers were, but it is a lot different now.''
Logan, who loves golf, plays at the Musselburgh courses off seven,
still finds time to take up the cudgels on behalf of Powderhall, which
has shut the door on the dogs. He feels passionately that the game's
followers deserve a stay of execution and if he can't save Powderhall he
wants to see a campaign to build a new leisure stadium in the area.
How good would he have become if he had taken up sprinting earlier? He
thinks about the question and says: ''It wouldn't have happened, because
I would have tried the football first anyway.''
He went on to have a winning day as a bookie at Hamilton on Tuesday.
The lessons have been learned. By some, at least.

PLAY your cards right and zero dividend Preference shares, or zeros as
they are affectionately known, are that dream investment which can offer
a safe, tax-free return of nearly 9% a year. The trouble is you have
probably never come across them unless you are an expert on investment
trusts or your financial adviser has studied their merits.
Zeros are in the news because at a time when the world's stock markets
don't know where they are going, safe investments such as these come
into their own. Over the last year they have out-performed all other
investment trust sectors. According to figures produced by Micropal,
they rose on average by 5.65% in the year to April compared with a rise
of just 1.7% in the Footsie.
But what are zeros and how do you find out about them? They are issued
by a number of specialist investment trusts, have a fixed life and pay
no income. Instead, investors get a pre-determined amount when the trust
is wound up. The return is not guaranteed because the trust must have
enough assets to repay the shareholders. However, it is possible to find
zeros which carry very little risk, either because they have many years
to run or because the trust already has sufficient assets.
Although zeros are not entirely risk free, they work rather like
National Savings certificates. The best place to find out about them is
to ask the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) for its
factsheet and a copy of its monthly information bulletin. These give
details of 37 zeros currently available.
There is a wide choice of repayment dates -- and a big variation in
risk. This is reflected in the returns which range from 7.6% to more
than 12%, with the biggest risk attached to those offering the highest
return. Return is the difference between today's share price and the
price at which they are expected to be repaid expressed as an annual
rate of interest. Take Scottish National, the biggest issue. The zeros
cost around 242p and they will be repaid at 325p at end-September 1998,
which is equivalent to an annual return of 8.8%.
But how safe is that? Scottish National's assets are already
sufficient to repay the zero dividend shareholders 1.3 times. This can
also be expressed as something called a ''hurdle rate''. This shows by
how much the trust's assets must grow or can fall before the zero
repayment can be made or becomes at risk. Scottish National's hurdle
rate is minus 5.9%, which means its assets can fall by 5.9% a year
before the repayment is at risk.
Zeros can save you tax too. There is no income tax to pay although you
may have to pay capital gains tax when you sell. However, if you don't
normally pay this you can take advantage of the annual tax-free
allowance of #6000 for an individual or #12,000 for a married couple who
hold investments jointly. If you take profits up to this limit your
investment will be entirely tax free.
This is particularly attractive to higher-rate taxpayers who have
investments they want to shield from income tax. Zeros are also very
useful for medium-term financial planning. Their most obvious use is for
paying school or college fees. A lump sum can be divided between a
number of zeros which mature in different years. An alternative is to
buy just a couple of ultra safe ones and sell some of the holding when
necessary.
People heading for retirement, who don't want income but need to avoid
paying higher-rate tax on their investments while they are still
working, should also consider zeros.
There are costs associated with buying and selling them but these can
be quite modest. Many are available through savings schemes run by
investment trust management companies. Depending on the company, the
minimum investment is between #250 and #1000, and the commission varies
from nothing to 1%.
The AITC's factsheet and monthly information bulletin, which includes
details of the savings schemes, are available from Durrant House, 8-13
Chiswell Street, London EC1Y 4YY; tel: 0171 588 5347.

POETRY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR: AN INTERNATIONAL ANTHOLOGY
edited by Desmond Graham
Chatto and Windus, #18.99
FROM a poetic, as well as a historical, point of view the First World
War was a Great War for England. Many English poets rose imaginatively
before they fell physically to the occasion. Rupert Brooke immortalised
the English soldier in five sonnets and was himself immortalised in an
obituary Churchill contributed to The Times of April 26, 1915: ''He
expected to die; he was willing to die for the dear England whose beauty
and majesty he knew.'' The bloody business of war was approached with
pleasure in Brooke's purple poetry and Churchill's purple prose.
If war was verbal heaven for Brooke and Churchill, it was mental hell
for Wilfred Owen who, after fighting at the Somme in 1917, was sent to
Craiglockhart War Hospital for neurasthenics. At Craiglockhart Owen met
his mentor Siegfried Sassoon, then returned to the front to die and live
through the Sassoonish poems he left behind him. For Brooke and Owen the
Great War was the greatest thing that had ever happened. They were war
poets, defined by an experience they found inspirational for better or
worse.
The Second World War was second best for English poets around at the
time. Brooke and Owen had offered answers about the inhuman nature of
war so a crucial question had to be asked in their absence. ''Where are
the war poets?'' asked C Day Lewis in 1943 in a poem that saw ''No
subject for immortal verse''. English poetry had no need for a new war
poet as it had a grand old warrior alive and well and living in London
and composing war speeches in poetic style.
Churchill's famous speech of June 4, 1940, in the House of Commons
spoke more poetically than most slim volumes. See it as verse and you
will see what I mean: ''We shall fight on the beaches,/We shall fight on
the landing grounds,/ We shall fight in the fields and in the
streets,/We shall fight in the hills,/We shall never surrender.''
Churchill, with his romantic rhetoric and rhythm, was the Rupert Brooke
of the Second World War and professional English poets could not match
his warrior mentality and triumphal tone.
As for the anti-war attitude, it had been eloquently expressed before
and English poets of the Second World War could not compete with the
pacifist pugnacity of Sassoon or Owen's loving embrace of the enemy.
Having no urgent message to deliver, English poets of the Second World
War wrote curiously relaxed and dispassionate poetry.
Henry Reed's Naming of Parts accepts the tedium of training for war.
As soldiers are told what to do with their rifles, one takes poetic
licence with his weapon: ''we call this/Easing the spring. And rapidly
backwards and forwards/The early bees are assaulting and fumbling the
flowers;/They call it easing the Spring.'' Whereas Brooke felt his war
was a brave crusade, Reed felt his was a boring curse. Before he was
killed in Normandy in 1944, Keith Douglas wrote peaceful poems about
war. How to Kill opens on an image of a child playing with a ball then
moves calmly to the spectacle of a soldier with another soldier in his
sights. Thinking of the man he has killed, the surviving soldier
reflects: ''I am amused/to see the centre of love diffused/and the waves
of love travel into vacancy./How easy it is to make a ghost.'' Whereas
Sassoon and Owen were angry about the First World War, Douglas could
write as a man amused by the Second.
In general, then, English poetry had exhausted itself on the subject
of world war by the time the Second came around, so particularly fine
poets, like Douglas, rejected the patriotic fervour of Brooke and
refused to repeat the furious warnings of Sassoon and Owen. Desmond
Graham, author of an impressive biography of Douglas, describes his hero
as ''probably the finest British poet'' of the Second World War but
acknowledges the paucity of English war poetry of the period by going
easy on Douglas and other English poets and going outside England for
energetic expressions of emotion.
He finds one Scottish poet fighting mad at the indifference of
official England to the fate of a fighting man. A poem called Heroes, by
Sorley MacLean, remembers an English soldier who fought and fell only to
be forgotten by the country that raised him: ''No cross or medal was put
to his/chest or to his name or to his family . . . I saw a great warrior
of England,/a poor manikin on whom no eye would rest.'' Other Scots,
such as Robert Garioch and Hamish Henderson, also stressed the
sufferings of the common man a world away from official English ideas of
heroism.
The First World War was, according to the finest war poets of the
period, all about all-conquering England but the Second explored areas
beyond Brooke's ''foreign field/That is forever England''. Nobuyuki Saga
wrote about Hiroshima: ''people vaporized instantly/are walking in
mid-air''. Janos Pilinsky about Ravensbruck: ''The prison garb, the
convict's skull/blink like a projection.'' Czeslaw Milosz about the
Warsaw Ghetto: ''Breaking of glass, wood, copper, nickel, silver.''
Eugen Jebeleanu about Lidice: ''My fingers found the tears in my
eyes,/but I did not want to cry.''
Graham's ambitious anthology offers poems from more than 20 countries
to show how the Second World War involved a larger literary community
than that associated with little England where the most telling poetry
was in the prose written and spoken by a Prime Minister with a voice
from the past.

HOW heavy is a kilogram and can it ever get any heavier? Surprising
though it may seem, the world's most famous kilogram is actually putting
on weight.The ''reference'' kilogram, a platinum-iridium cylinder
against which all other masses are defined, is the last remaining
artefact of the SI international system of measurement and it is housed
at the Bureau International des Poids et Measures just outside Paris.
No-one knows exactly when the reference kilogram was made, but it is
believed to have been produced in the late 1880s by a Paris instrument
maker. Over the last century, though, the original has gained a few
hundred micrograms in weight as a result of contamination from two main
sources -- hydrocarbons from the environment and mercury that has been
absorbed on to the surface.
The kilogram is cleaned every few years using an ordinary shammy
leather dipped in an ethanol-based cleaning fluid but scientists at the
UK's National Physical Laboratory have now discovered that, although the
polishing has been reasonably successful at removing carbonation and
mercury on the kilogram's surface, the cleaning itself has actually
caused a number of surface defects.
Scientists at the NPL have been carrying out experiments into new
methods of giving the kilogram its regular spit and polish. Their best
effort so far uses a photochemical decomposition process -- specimen
kilograms are exposed to ultraviolet light and ozone and the
contaminants diffuse into the atmosphere.
Could this discovery mean that, in time, we will all be able to
abandon our mops and buckets and nuke the kitchen floor with a burst of
ultraviolet light?

AS WE APPROACH THE millennium, more and more people will opt for the
choice of working from home rather than in formal office environments.
Linking homes to homes, people to people, and even offices to offices
via on-screen communication is with us now, but the link is usually
restricted to one command site at a pre-determined location.
A Scottish company, QData Information Systems, in the village of
Evanton, north of Inverness, has developed a new piece of software that
allows any IBM-compatible PC to simultaneously view and control up to 16
others, regardless of location.
The idea was inspired by the concept of remote education networks in
sparsely populated areas of the Highlands and Islands, much of which is
linked via ISDN telecommunication lines. The new software, MARC, has
already been snapped up by the Benefits Agency in the Highlands which is
using it for the training of staff in remote locations, Citibank in
London, and even the Metropolitan police.

THE Starship Enterprise, or a real version of it, may soon be docking
on Mars, according to astronomer Patrick Moore, and this could lead to
there being two types of human beings -- earthlings and their relations
on Mars who have been born and brought up on a Martian space station.
Speaking at the Edinburgh International Science Festival, Moore
described Mars as ''much the least unfriendly world in the solar
system'' and revealed that there is now ''serious talk of sending a
manned space craft to Mars''.
However, the downside of space travel is that babies born on Mars may
never be able to visit planet Earth as gravity on Mars is less than ours
and people would weigh about a third of their Earth weight.
''Just imagine if, suddenly, without any increase in your heart or
muscle power, you weighed three times as much. It takes several months
to get to Mars and we don't know how the human form would react but I
think it may happen within the next 30 to 40 years, or even earlier,
with possibly a base on Mars by this time next century,'' said the
astronomer.
If you're stuck for something to do over the holiday weekend, you can
still catch some of the fascinating exhibitions, tours and hands-on
events at the Festival during today, tomorrow and Monday. Call the

THE tale of Tam o'Shanter may have stirred imaginations for more than
200 years, but it comes to you now as an explicit video-film with all
the dramatic effects of modern technology. Whatever the personal imagery
created by Robert Burns's most famous poem, it is all there in a
triple-screen, theatrical setting, from the drouthy rabble at the end of
a market day to that hair-raising ride through thunder and lightning
which finally confronted Tam with the devilish orgy of Kirk Alloway.
This is not, however, the kind of video you buy for the home. It
belongs exclusively to the new Tam o' Shanter Experience, housed just a
few hundred yards from the birthplace of the poet, in the small
community of Alloway, on the edge of Ayr. And it symbolises a piece of
common sense that brings together, under one management, the various
strands of Burns interest to be found at the scene of the poet's
beginnings. In the modern manner of simplified presentation, it will be
known as the Burns National Heritage Park.
The new attraction opened its doors to the public last night, but will
be launched officially by the Queen on July 5. At a time when many
historic draws are struggling to maintain their appeal, an immediate
result of the #1.75m expenditure is likely to be a doubling of the
70,000 annual visitors.
For the benefit of foreign tourists, an introduction to the story of
Burns is given in five languages -- though the recitation of Tam o'
Shanter sticks wisely to the Lowland Scots which, in any case, alongside
the visual presentation, provides its own onomatopoeia.
The focal point of interest has always been the humble, whitewashed
cottage where Burns was born in 1759, close by the main road running
southward from Ayr. Further down that route, within easy walking
distance, an impressive monument has stood in his honour since 1823 --
directly across the road from the haunted old ruin of Kirk Alloway (it
was a ruin even in Burns's day) where ''ghaists and houlets nightly
cry''.
Since the 1970s, on land adjacent to the Monument Gardens, the local
district council has run a Land o' Burns Centre, of modest ambition and
limited appeal. But it is here, in space that has been more than
doubled, that the Tam o' Shanter Experience brings a new vitality to the
explanation of Scotland's national bard.
The thinking behind the changes was clarified by Edward Clark, head of
Kyle and Carrick's Economic Development, who has been charged with
making it all happen. ''Visitor attractions generally have been going
through a bad time,'' he explained, ''and the Burns figures have been
level for a number of years now.
But we recognised that we had an asset that was not being properly
exploited.''
So the council turned to consultants, who came back with the kind of
common sense that sometimes masquerades these days as a specialist
wisdom. Yes, they should certainly be doing better. There was nothing
wrong with Burns, it was all to do with failing to market the product
properly.
Says Clark: ''They confirmed that it was a good idea to interpret Tam
o' Shanter and that it should be done at Alloway, beside the other
attractions. One of the difficulties was that the various Burns
locations were under different ownership and managed in different ways,
so there was no coherent marketing.'' The experts recommended that they
all be brought under one umbrella -- and that is now happening with the
creation of the Burns National Heritage Park, with a joint board.
Since the report was accepted, the trustees of Burns Monument, who
owned the cottage, have upgraded the poet's birthplace to good effect.
Kyle and Carrick District Council agreed it would take its Land o' Burns
Centre and change its character to that of a major visitor attraction.
And that was the main task confronting Clark and his assistant, Karen
Fraser.
The creation of the heritage park has involved not only the district
council and the trustees, but Enterprise Ayrshire and the Scottish
Tourist Board, too. Most of the #1.75m has come from the district
council, with a 45% grant from the European Regional Development Fund,
through the Strathclyde European Partnership. Enterprise Ayrshire also
chipped in.
With funding in place, work began last year on the extension of that
1970s building which would house the Tam o' Shanter Experience. This
novel adventure was put into the designing hands of a London company,
Event Communications, who dreamed up the whole concept of how to present
the famous poem on screen.
The result is that you now enter the attractive foyer and proceed to
an auditorium offering a 10-minute audio-visual introduction to the life
and work of Burns. Apart from the benefit of language translation on
head-sets, this is an extremely effective cameo, the perfect
introduction to those who know little or nothing about the national
bard, a category which, sadly, includes many Scots.
Having set the scene, it points you on the way to the Tam o' Shanter
story, described by John Buchan, among the tales written in verse, as
the best since Chaucer.
So you move into the main auditorium, seating more than 100 people,
and prepare for that video novelty which lasts for the 12[1/2] minutes
it takes to recite the poem. Now the words are married to a movie image
of how it might have been, from Tam's carousing with Souter Johnnie,
''his ancient, trusty, drouthy cronie,'' through that homeward ride to
his sulky dame. In between, of course, comes the dramatic encounter at
Kirk Alloway, where dancing witches and warlocks in a dance are set a
scene to match the raging thunderstorm beyond.
All of this, conceived in London and filmed in Ireland, for lack of
suitable facilities in Scotland, is not without its flaws. The orgy in
Kirk Alloway struck me as owing more to the quirks of modern
choreography than the devilish revelry as it might have been perceived
in Burns's day. If it relates to a modern audience, however, I suppose
all will be justified.
The technology is highly effective, spreading the visuals over three
screens, with back and front projections that add reality to the
over-all picture. From there you emerge to a restaurant area, with a
relaxing view of landscaped gardens.
My own choice of tackling this new heritage trail was to begin at the
Tam o' Shanter Experience, from which you can then follow a path to the
Burns Monument. The gardens surrounding the monument offer a splendid
view of the nearby Brig o' Doon, and suddenly the tale of Tam o' Shanter
springs back to mind. For wasn't it the key-stane of this brig that Tam
had to reach to avoid the pursing witches, who couldn't cross a stream?
You turn your gaze across the main road and the story comes even more
alive. For there lies Kirk Alloway, giving you the full picture of Tam's
escape route after his indiscretion about Cutty Sark. Pass this way of
an evening and the kirk is floodlit to eerie effect, now a silent
reminder of Burns's masterpiece.
The visitor can walk over that Brig o' Doon (model for the
much-maligned American musical) and across to Kirk Alloway, encountering
the grave of Burns's parents by the gate. A brisk walk along the road
and you come to the cottage of Burns's birth, built by the hand of his
own father. The humble abode, where the family lived with their few
animals, never fails to re-create the reality of the bard's beginnings,
a home of warmth, good learning, and fine fellowship.
The bed in which Burns was born is still there. Once again, the
head-set now tells you the story, but you let your imagination roam --
and flesh out the details in the adjoining museum with its riveting
collection of letters and documents, written in the hand of the man
himself.

IN a bay of bog bean on a forest loch, a group of Slavonian Grebes
have anchored their floating nests. There is a raucous colony of
black-headed gulls around, used as air cover by the grebes, who pull
weed over their eggs if they have to leave them. This is
Inverness-shire, where most of the 70 or so British pairs nest, and
neither of these strategies nor the shallow acid lochs they occupy offer
much protection against human predation. Pictish hunters no doubt snared
the birds, and last year a collector was fined #1000 for taking their
eggs.
This is not only a rare, but a spectacularly beautiful Scottish bird.
Last summer I walked in the forest in the cool of the evening and
watched them swimming near a prelapsarian shore: russet flanks and
breast, purple brown back and neck, the head shot through with a sunray
of golden feathers from a cherry-red eye to the crest that gives it its
American name of Horned Grebe.
Behind swam three chicks, striped black and white lengthways from bill
to backside. It must be the striped ripples on the dark-edged water they
imitate. The adults slipped underwater in an easy rolling dive for small
fish or crane-fly larvae. Each time they bounced up on the surface the
colours again exploded like the brightness of a Highland summer evening.
In winter they are scattered around the sandy bays of Scotland, from
Sullom Voe to Sligachan. Birds from the Baltic and Siberia join our own.
In Gullane bay you can see them diving with their Great Crested and
Red-necked cousins, the Slavonian smaller but all now dark grey and
white, the hodden of a North Sea winter morning.

BOY, didn't that twerp Brian Moore get a right good rucking from the
Scottish scribes after his sour and petulant outburst in the post-match
interviews at Twickers the other week? Well-deserved, too. I've always
thought it very appropriate that this clown plays for Harlequins, a
solicitor who acts more like a barrister.
But despair not, Brian, as far as I'm concerned you are nothing short
of a gift from the gods. For a decade I've searched for someone who
personifies the nasty, superior, arrogant, and flat-headed side of our
English cousins. I needed an image I could summon up to breathe life
into various written scenarios where the Scots pull a fast one over the
Auld Enemy. I can now put a face to that Englishman whose jaw drops in
stunned disbelief. Yes, folks, it's Brian Moore.
An example of the sort of situation I'm describing would surely be
useful. For months, maybe it's years now, I've wanted to tell you a
smashing yarn for which I'm indebted to a long-time supporter of this
column, Bob Swift, citizen of Argyll, for supplying. But the English
''front row'' in this little production were always an anonymous crew. I
could never put a face to them -- until now.
Picture the scene if you will. It's the Hundred Years War and France
and Scotland are ranged against Public Enemy Number One -- the English.
The year is 1356 and we're somewhere in France where the Earl of
Douglas, one of the Alliance commanders, was among a group of Scots
taken prisoner. From his expensive and ornate armour the English
surmised, not unreasonably, that he must be of noble blood and began
rubbing their hands at the prospect of the ransom.
The story goes that they were about to strip off his armour when
another prisoner, Sir William Ramsay of Colluthy, fixed Douglas with a
withering stare and in a violent outburst demanded to know why a servant
was decked out in his master's armour. He denounced the man in the fancy
armour as a ''cursed, damnable murderer''.
''Come hither and pull off my boot,'' he ordered. Over came Douglas,
trembling and looking suitably cowed, and knelt to remove the boot. Sir
William then picked it up and proceeded to get ladled into the Earl. As
the blows rained down, the bewildered English intervened, saying that
Douglas was clearly an important nobleman. Sir William had another
description: ''He is a scullion and a base knave who has, I suppose,
killed his master. Go you villain to the field, search for the body of
my cousin, your master . . . that at least I can give him a decent
burial.''
He is then said to have handed over a 40-shilling ransom to the
bemused warders for this mere ''servant'', had another couple of swipes
at him with the boot, and sent him packing. Douglas didn't need a second
telling, and set off to rejoin the Franco-Scots force.
From the very start of this marvellous piece of theatre, the Earl had
clocked what the wily Sir Willie was up to and joined in the charade,
taking the blows and abuse in what must have been a performance worthy
of a medieval Oscar.
And who is that sourpuss of a hooker -- sorry, jailer -- standing
counting his 40 pieces of silver, feeling cheated but not knowing why?
God bless you, Brian. May yer twisted lip never straighten while I've
still a myth or three to scotch.

IT is not only the tour operators' brochures that flood in at this
time of the year. The bright covers of guidebooks have also come skiting
in over the desk, tempting me to Moscow, Athens, Paris, Tunisia, India,
even up the 3000ft heights of the mountains of Mallorca. The sheer
number and style of the publications is mind-blowing, and this short
guide is only a nibble at the great mass.
Apa Insight Guides celebrate their silver anniversary this year, from
the day when Hans Hofer arrived on the Indonesian island of Bali, newly
trained as a graphic artist and photographer, and decided it needed a
book. Now 200 books on, the latest is the Insight Guide to Cuba.
Insight Guides are distinguished by the fact that they look at a
country in the round -- politically, socially, economically, and
culturally -- and are written mostly by journalists. People read them to
learn about a country long before they go there, and also when they come
back. Insights are famed, too, for photography.
Apa's second series of much shorter books is the Pocket Guides, again
the personal choice of their authors in looking at the different
countries. But recently, following a new partnership with the German
academic publisher, Langenscheit, Apa has embarked on a series of
Insight Compact Guides. This small encyclopaedic guide crams every
possible facet of a place into 100 pages. Eighteen titles come on to the
shelves this month, and Apa expects to have 50 ready by the end of the
first year.
* OVER the last few years, the Automobile Association has been
channelling a lot of energy through its publishing section to three
series of guidebooks. The AA Essential Explorer is its biggest, designed
for use on the spot, with an A-Z index, folding-out map, and easy quick
reference section. The AA's smallest pocket guide is the Essential,
ideal to slip into a pocket. The Travellers series, a joint venture with
Thomas Cook, is well-planned, with a solid base of practical information
and description, shot with interesting snippets.
* SCOTLAND'S secret cold-war nuclear bunker, not far from St Andrews,
opened to the public for the first time this month. From here, Scottish
Nuclear Command would have operated in the event of a nuclear strike. A
labyrinth of passages and rooms, 100ft underground, is protected by 15ft
of reinforced concrete. This is where up to 300 people would have
organised medical, firefighting, and police services, plus
counter-attacks. It is quite self-sufficient, with its own water and
electricity supplies. The bunker was built secretly, the entrance
disguised as a farmhouse. A macabre but fascinating place.
Information: 01333 310301.
* MOST people think of Rough Guides as back-packers' bibles, but the
publisher denies this. Nowadays, although still designed for
independent-minded travellers, they are for people at every budget
level. Usually written by a principal writer and a team, Rough Guides
are light on the flowery phrase but keenly observant -- more than 500
pages of practicalities. Since the company started in 1982, series
editor Mark Ellingham has wanted to publish a Rough Guide to India. It
is now part of the latest list, joining 60 or so existing titles, as do
guides to Moscow, Malaysia, and Singapore.
* CICERONE Press is a specialist publisher of walking and climbing
guides, based in Cumbria and headed by Walt Unsworth. He is a former
editor of Climber and Rambler and author of Encyclopaedia of
Mountaineering and Hold the Heights. Cicerone Guides are necessities for
both experienced mountain walkers, out at all seasons, and more
leisurely walkers. Apart from practical information, they include many
routes and maps and sections on natural history, geology, scenery, and
more: invaluable for serious walkers. Two 1990s titles are Walking in
the South Pennines by Gladys Sellers and Walking in Mallorca by June
Parker, revised 1994.
* FOR the last few years, Finland has had great success in claiming
Father Christmas as a resident, with the Santa Claus Workshop Village on
the Arctic Circle, near Rovaniemi in Lapland. Here, the post office
handles thousands of letters, and thousands of visitors come to see
Santa. Greenland and Sweden have both made a similar bid but, so far,
Finland's favourite is in the lead. What is more surprising is that this
part of Finland now appears to have acquired trolls, the ugly little
creatures that originate in Norway, based on the curious shapes you see
in rocks.
All this is part of The World of Children's Fantasy, brought about by
Canterbury Travel.Flights from London or Manchester.

Information: 01333 310301.
* ALREADY popular for days out is the Edinburgh Canal Centre at Ratho,
based on the Bridge Inn, a staging post between Edinburgh and Glasgow
when the canal was built in 1825. The inn has good food, there is a
Visitor Centre, and lots of canal activities such as the Scottish Open
Canal Jump Competition and canal cruising in the vintage Ratho Princess.
The modern boats, Pride of the Union and Pride of Belhaven, are
available for cruises and all sorts of private parties -- even wedding
ceremonies.

THE Desert Highway is what it says it is: a highway in the desert. We
have reached its southern rim, and as we loop down through the foothills
of the Wadi Rum mountains the echo of an actorish voice sounds in my
ears: ''Aqaba. Aqaba from the land.'' Like Lawrence of Arabia, we have
crossed the desert to take Aqaba from the land.
Not for us, however, the searing sun, the rocking camel and Omar
Sharif, but conditioned air, a period Dodge, and the courteous company
of George, our driver-guide from Amman. George regrets he can't show us
Petra, but we must stay on schedule for our appointment in Aqaba and
besides -- the imagination falters -- we know the rose-red city will be
entertaining 400 Canberra cruisers.
The Gulf of Aqaba is a slash through the naked hills of Jordan and
Israel. Aqaba and Eilat, Red Sea resorts of enemy-neighbours soon to
negotiate a truce, face each other across the water. There, between the
playgrounds and battlefields of Arab and Jew, we keep our tryst with an
old friend: Canberra, the grande dame of the P and O cruise fleet.
If there is anything more thrilling than a nautical landfall, it's the
reverse: embarkation in a foreign port. From the hills, the liner looks
like a dislocated iceberg defying the heat of the Aqaba waterfront, and
then we are close enough to see her yellow twin funnels, the flying
bridge-wings and the bow that was built for big seas; the silhouette and
superstructure that set her apart from today's generation of
purpose-built cruise ships.
We have flown from Scotland via Amsterdam to Amman and crossed 200
miles of desert to keep this rendezvous; but Canberra has travelled
farther. She has crossed the world's great oceans, the Atlantic and the
Pacific, and some exotic ponds: the Coral, South China, Arabian, and Red
seas. She has almost circumnavigated the globe, and she is more or less
on time.
But her punctuality, we learn, has required a bit of push and shove --
APR, All Possible Revs, as they say on the bridge. Much of Canberra's
voyage through the Arabian Sea was conducted at maximum speed, almost 23
knots, as she sailed to the scene of a maritime disaster. The veteran of
the Falklands War has been having new adventures; she has only just
arrived at the Jordanian port in time to dispatch her cargo of cruisers
to Petra for the day.
About two-thirds of Canberra's world cruise passengers are
fly-cruisers, people who join the ship for different legs of the voyage.
The crew have perfected the procedures for boarding newcomers, but there
are only three of us joining at Aqaba, which is not normally an
embarkation port. Nonetheless, they're expecting us; Captain Ian Gibb
knows we are from the press, and as soon as we have unpacked he invites
us to his cabin for a briefing on ''the Stolidi incident''.
Earlier this month, the new, 67,000-ton superliner Oriana received her
royal christening at Southampton and entered P and O's service, with
Captain Gibb in command. Last year he took Canberra round the world for
the last time, and some 12 hours out of Bombay his elegiac voyage with a
favourite ship turned into a dramatic one.
''In the early morning we picked up a signal from a Liberian LNG
(Liquid Nitrogen Gas carrier) that had found a blazing tanker and a
lifeboat with injured crew members. Medical assistance was requested,
and it seems we were the only other ship in the area.''
The nature of cruise ships may be indulgent, the ambitions of
passengers fixed frivolously on the next bag of sights or shoreside
shopping opportunity. But no mariner ignores a call for help. Canberra
altered course and steamed towards the position of the emergency. That
afternoon, her lifeboats transferred seven Filipino casualties from the
LNG Hilli and installed them in Canberra's hospital. Their story was
grim; a flash fire had zipped through the living quarters of their ship,
the tanker Stolidi, and some of the crew had died where they stood.
Nineteen of the Stolidi's complement were missing. Of the injured
survivors, two were moribund when they were brought on board, and five
had bad burns. The ship's medical staff, whose expertise more usually
lies with the resuscitation of elderly passengers in cardiac arrest,
cleared the hospital of its minor invalids and did what they could. Even
the cruisers helped. The passenger list yielded six nurses, one with
burns experience.
The liner was more than 1000 nautical miles from a French military
hospital in Djibouti, on the Gulf of Aden, and the order went out for
APR. During the next 48 hours, Canberra averaged more than 22 knots
which, in tropical waters, bring heat and fumes to the engine-room and
the ultimate challenge to the concentration of each watch. The idlers on
the sundeck felt her speed, too.
At first light, before most passengers were awake, she rendezvoused
with French Army helicopters in the Gulf of Aden and the two most
critical casualties were evacuated to Djibouti; after which, Canberra
entered the Red Sea and resumed her passage to Aqaba. ''We got here at
10 this morning,'' concluded Captain Gibb, ''three hours late. We should
have been here at seven.''
He was matter-of-fact, with neither pride nor plaint in his voice; an
understated, very British way of summarising five days of serious
sailing to serious purpose. And his problems weren't over. There were
two Filipinos in the ship's morgue, with no papers of identity or
passports to anywhere short of Eternity. ''The Jordanians have been
terrific. They've agreed to take the bodies ashore and try to get them
home.''
So. Our pleasure trip on the last two weeks of Canberra's world cruise
-- Aqaba to Southampton via Suez, Port Said, Haifi, Piraeus, and Naples
-- began with a sober story. Was it possible to forget the inferno in
the Arabian Sea and the three injured sailors who remained in the ship's
hospital? I'm afraid it was. It's possible to forget almost anything
when you're at sea. Within hours of embarking, I was in conversation
with a woman from Yorkshire whose three-month voyage had allowed her to
forget she was dying.
She didn't quite spell it out. She was on her own, but she mentioned a
husband at home. ''He couldn't get away. This was something we were
keeping for our retirement, and then I became ill and . . . keeping it
for our retirement was no longer an option. So I came alone.'' She
looked strikingly well after 70-odd days at sea; brown and relaxed and
misleadingly healthy. ''Your brain switches off,'' she explained. ''The
ship becomes your home. If I could bring my family on board I could go
on circling the world forever.''
She'd partied until dawn through the Caribbean, and across the
Americas by way of Panama. Some 400 fellow passengers have done the
whole trip, and although many have bonded with each other, shipboard
life has also been a series of hellos and goodbyes. ''Things quietened
down after San Francisco, when a lot of people got off.''
Reinforcements of social energy arrived with Australia, although there
were some grumbles for the vivacious weekend cruisers who joined the
ship at Adelaide and Melbourne for three-day budget jaunts round their
own coast. ''Yobs,'' said the Victor Meldrew lookalike at the
neighbouring table in the Pacific Restaurant.
Meldrew by looks, Meldrew by temperament. He and his wife were on
their third Canberra world cruise, loved the ship, hated the world. We
learned not to trust the judgment of a couple who did not enjoy their
excursion to Sorrento and found the scenery of its glorious peninsula
''all the same''. They amplified: ''Once you've seen one orange tree,
you've seen them all.''
We do not cruise to be sociable, but to be at sea, and there are
plenty like us: the shipboard equivalent of the railway buff, always on
deck for the uplifting of the pilot or the ancient manoeuvres of making
fast or slipping moorings, traditions of seamanship which, in their
essentials, haven't changed much since the first mariners learned to
navigate.
As regards the world, cruising isn't travelling, but sampling. We have
made our plans. We will go ashore independently at Athens and Naples and
-- because there is no other way in the time available -- take the tour
on offer from Haifa to Jerusalem. But first there is a passage through
the last days of the British Empire: the Suez Canal, a name that shamed
a generation of politicians.
Other spectacles of the Eastern Mediterranean -- the Pyramids at Giza,
the Wailing Wall, the Dome of the Rock, the temples of the Acropolis --
are part of classroom history, other people's history. Suez belongs more
personally to the memory of parents bending over the radio, and the
urgency of their attention.
It doesn't disappoint. We feel we know these flat, hot shores as if
they are drawn on the map of our childhood: to starboard the Sinai
Desert, the colour of old bones, to port the spring green of the Nile
Delta. The ditch between is a one-way street. Only in the Great Bitter
Lakes, where ships were trapped when the canal was blocked by the
Egyptians during the Six-Day War (and stayed trapped until it reopened
eight years later in 1975) can vessels pass each other at the same time.
The Canal Authority operates a convoy system; vessels enter in groups
at fixed hours from either end, passing each other at a handful of
''lay-bys'' and in the Bitter Lakes. We wait our turn in the Gulf of
Suez, entertained by fleets of souvenir boats that have put out from the
port. The acrobatic vendors climb to the top of the masts and throw
ropes to the passengers, who haul on board, for inspection and barter,
baskets loaded with T-shirts, leather jewellery boxes, and cheap papyrus
prints of the Sphinx.
The canal transit takes an average of 12 hours, and we receive an
invitation to spend some of it on the bridge. Captain Gibb is
part-exasperated, part-amused by the two Egyptian pilots who have come
on board at Suez and will be disembarked at Port Said. ''I'm not quite
sure why they think we need two pilots.'' Later, at the hour of the
muezzin, the reason reveals itself: one man asks for the use of a cabin
in which to pray, while the other takes over his duties.
From the town of Ismailia, a road and a railway run parallel to the
west bank of the canal and a little wooden train salutes us with a toot.
On the empty Sinai side three robed Arabs on camels lift their arms in
greeting before drifting in to a pool of desert heat. Dusk falls over
Port Said, and the city built on sand dredged from the canal runs
brilliantly on to the quay where Canberra berths. We are embarking
excursionists to Giza, who have travelled overland from Suez, and some
40 fly-cruisers from Cairo.
The relationship between short-haul holidaymakers and entrenched world
cruisers is delicate, and potentially tricky. We are sometimes met with
the polite resistance and faint condescension that the native resident
reserves for the day tripper, and some passengers have found themselves
cemented into inflexible routines, with stoutly defended territorial
rights to deck space and bar stool.
Others welcome the input of fresh blood, the chance to repeat
themselves to new audiences. Cruising is Elysium for eavesdroppers.
Overheard in the Stadium Theatre: ''I travel all the time. I'm only home
a week and then I'm off on another ship to Australia and New Zealand.''
Overheard in the Bonito Club: ''Then, blow me, my daughter went and died
and that was my whole family wiped out.''
Israel, savoured in a day, requires concentration. Batteries of buses
are primed for action on Haifa's quay, and the efficiency of the Israeli
tour operators is intense and disciplined. Nine hundred Canberra
cruisers are dispersed to Jerusalem and Bethlehem, to Nazareth and
Galilee, to Jericho, Masada, and the Dead Sea. Besides their drivers and
guides, each convoy of buses has an escort of tough-looking young men
with walkie-talkies who co-ordinate things. Some of them carry guns.
The air cools as we steam through the Greek islands towards Piraeus,
where the light is celestial but the temperature sharp. ''Wrap up
warmly,'' advises Canberra's Tannoy, a mother ship fussing over her
charges. On the advice of the maitre d' in the Pacific Restaurant we
walk through the port to its subway and catch the train into Athens. In
the crystalline light the Parthenon, on its white rock, looks like the
lodge at the gateway to heaven, and we have timed our visit to miss the
bus parties. We lunch peacefully in the Plaka, and on my third visit to
Athens I revise upwards my opinion of the Greek capital.
Sunset over Peloponnesos, and Craig Douglas is singing in the Crystal
Room. ''She-he was only sixteen, only sixteen, and I loved her so-ho.''
Old pop stars never die, they play cabaret at sea. My husband, who is
sentimental about the sixties, shakes Craig's hand and tells him he
remembers all his numbers, especially Venus in Blue Jeans. ''That wasn't
me,'' says the veteran vocalist, crestfallen. ''That was Mark Wynter.''
Naples is windy, and those who take the hydrofoil to Capri regret it.
Italy is almost home, and we feel at home in Naples, whose population of
petty criminals treats the arrival of large cruise ships as giro day. In
fact, their haul is small; of the hundreds who go ashore, only six lose
possessions to pickpockets and bag-snatchers.
A breezy run past the Balearics until Gibraltar, with its little cap
of British cloud, is on our starboard and the straits funnel us into the
Atlantic. Canberra's bow bucks through the Bay of Biscay, and in the
Crow's Nest Piano Bar the sea thumps the windows and martinis fly. Then
up the Solent to Canberra's home port.   ''Hmmm,'' says our neighbour on
B deck, inspecting a grey sky and Southhampton's Western Docks. ''I'm
not sure I like the look of this port. I think I'll stay on board.''
For some people, on some ships, three months is never enough.
* Next year Oriana makes her first world cruise, but Canberra's world
cruise programme also continues. Her 1996 east-west circuit includes
Cape Town, the Seychelles, Hong Kong, Sydney, Honolulu, San Francisco,
and the Panama Canal transit, and departs on January 8, 1996. Prices for
the 92-night voyage start at #5399, and there is the usual option of
fly-cruising on different legs. Brochures and details of all P and O

FOR those of you who haven't yet decided what to have for Easter
lunch, I have a suggestion. It may not seem terribly original, but at
this late stage I can't think that anyone wants to go searching out
exotic spices and ingredients, or spend hours poring over a recipe in a
hot kitchen.
I think an ideal lunch for Easter is roast chicken with a lemon,
grape, and rice stuffing and with a creamy lemon and parsley sauce to go
with it. A point to make at the start: I consider it worthwhile to look
for free-range chickens rather than just the cheapest ones on the
supermarket shelf. The difference is distinct both in taste and texture,
and, incidentally, in the stock you may decide to make with the bones.
The stuffing takes as long to make as does the rice to cook, about 20
minutes. The sauce can be made ahead by an hour or so and kept warm in a
gentle heat, providing you remember not to add the chopped parsley till
the last minute.
If you have a microwave oven, you can make the sauce in it and it will
take six to eight minutes' cooking time. I am a recent convert to
microwaves, rather late in my culinary day, you will agree, but better
late than never. The only trouble with a convert sometimes is their
fanaticism and I am, admittedly, very keen on the time-saving ability of
my microwave!
The tastes of lemon and chicken are refreshing and complementary, and
I always think that parsley is a wonderful herb. All too often it is
thought of only as a garnish, whereas its flavour is vital and
complementary to just about every savoury food I can think of.
Parsley also has a beneficial effect on overeating, and for this
reason, what with a possible surfeit of Easter-egg consumption, a good
dose of the herb may be an excellent idea. I realise that I am talking
about lunch, but I am also a chocolate addict, much given to
self-indulgence on Easter morning via a chocolate breakfast, and I know
there are many others like me.
A further example of the herbal effects of parsley as a remedy can be
found in the pages of Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit, when Peter,
suffering from an overdose of lettuces and feeling rather sick, looks
for some parsley.
Roast Chicken with Lemon, Grape, and Rice Stuffing, and with Lemon and
Parsley Sauce (Serves 5-6)
1 chicken weighing about 3[1/2] lbs
2 oz butter
4 oz basmati rice
chicken stock
1 onion, skinned and chopped finely
2 tablespoons olive-oil
grated rind of 1 well washed and dried lemon
4 oz grapes, each cut in half and seeds removed -- black or green
salt, freshly ground black pepper
Make the stuffing by heating the olive-oil in a saucepan and cooking
the chopped onion until soft -- about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the rice well
for a minute. Then pour in stock till it comes about 1" above the level
of the rice. As you add the stock to the pan there will be a whoosh of
steam; let this subside, which it will do in half a minute or so, to let
you see the level of liquid above the rice. Cover the pan with a
tea-towel and then the lid of the pan; do not stir the rice from this
point. Put the pan back on gentle heat for 5 minutes, then draw the pan
off the heat and leave for 15 minutes. The rice will have absorbed all
the stock. Let this cool completely before mixing in the grapes and
lemon rind and stuffing the chicken.
Swab out the inside of the chicken with absorbent kitchen paper and
rub the bird with butter. Season it with salt and pepper, and stuff with
the cooled stuffing, pushing it in well. Put the bird in a roasting tin
with either stock or white wine -- or just water -- to a depth of about
1", and roast in a fairly hot oven, 400'F, gas mark 6 200'C for 50
minutes. Stick a knife in the chicken's thigh just to check the juices
run clear and aren't tinged with pink -- if they are, continue to roast
it for a further 10 minutes.
Creamy Lemon and Parsley Sauce
[1/4] pint single cream and [1/4] pint milk
2 oz butter
1 teaspoon flour
2 large egg yolks
grated rinds of 2 lemons (wash them very well first to remove the
preservative)
juice of 2 lemons
1 teaspoon mustard powder
salt, pepper
2-3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
Put the cream and milk, butter, flour, egg yolks, and grated lemon
rind and mustard into a liquidiser or food processor and whiz till
smooth. Pour this into a heatproof bowl and sit it in a pan of simmering
water. Stir with a metal whisk from time to time as the sauce cooks and
gradually thickens -- this takes about 20-30 mins, depending on the
depth of the water around the bowl.
When the sauce is thick, take the bowl out of the water and stir in
the lemon juice. Just before serving, stir in the chopped parsley, but
only then, because if the parsley is added too soon and sits in the hot
sauce for any length of time it will lose its bright colour and fresh
taste.
NB: The sauce should have the consistency of thick cream.

AROUND #7000 pounds-plus for the average wedding, eh? If getting
hitched these days costs that much (according to a glossy brides
magazine), you'd think that more and more couples would be opting for a
no-frills elopement. But apparently this year's British brides -- an
estimated 217,000 of them -- will be spending a total of #16.7 billion
on ''the works'': everything from personalised balloons for the guests
to exotic honeymoons in the South Pacific.
Speaking from personal experience, I can thoroughly recommend the
no-frills approach. I wore a new jumper and my best trousers for our
wedding in Martha Street, Glasgow, which was followed by lunch for the
entire bridal party -- all eight of us, including the bride and 'groom's
two children -- at a nearby Italian restaurant. (Civil ceremonies have
come a long way since 30-odd years ago when a friend was witness for a
couple whose rural registrar greeted them in his string vest and kept
one eye on the telly -- Saturday afternoon wrestling with the sound
turned down -- throughout).
Rhona and Gordon, due to wed in October, will steer a middle course
between rock bottom and go-for-broke. Having investigated the
possibility of being wed quietly ''up a hill somewhere on Arran'', the
civil ceremony will, instead, take place in Glasgow at the splendid
marriage suites in Park Circus (#161.00 for Saturday afternoon peak
time) in front of 60 guests, to the delight of Rhona's mum, who wanted
to treat her daughter to a traditional wedding.
There will be a reception for 80 at a small city centre restaurant
where a hot buffet, including vegetarian dishes, will be laid on and the
wedding party will have the run of the premises (estimated cost: #1500).
Wine will be available, but other drinks can be bought at the bar.
Rhona is designing her own wedding dress and having it and her flower
girl's dress made by a colleague. The bridesmaid is making her own.
Rhona says: ''My dress will be short, purple, probably with a matching
coat. Gordon will wear tartan trews or a kilt. We are not hiring fancy
cars, having a video made, or using a professional photographer. I'd
like to ask all our guests who bring cameras to submit two photographs
each for a really personal album, but my mum isn't very keen on the
idea.''
The couple are having simple flowers and a chocolate wedding cake;
hope to avoid both the stag and hen night; and plan to honeymoon in
northern Spain or the Czech Republic.
Rhona said: ''Gordon and I have lived together for almost two years,
so there isn't much we need -- apart from a wheelbarrow and a garden
shed. I hate the idea of wedding lists, and would like our guests to buy
us second-hand things.'' Approximate cost of wedding, including
honeymoon? Around #3500.
While it's true that Rhona and Gordon couldn't have had a civil
wedding up a hill on Arran, they could have had one at the island's
register office in Lamlash for the basic rate of #67. ''A lot of people
come here to get married,'' said the registrar. ''Afterwards, they
usually get their pictures taken outside the office, with the Holy Isle
in the background. We've never had a couple dressed in hill-walking
gear, but we've had one or two biker weddings.''
When Monica and Gerard married in Glasgow they had a church wedding
with all the trimmings; Rolls-Royces, two pipers, masses of flowers,
guests flying in from abroad; a sit-down meal for 100 at the historic
Trades Hall in Glassford Street (#635 to hire, peak time), with wine and
a live band for dancing; stunning gowns for bride and three attendants;
home visit for same from hairdresser; de luxe foreign honeymoon.
Total expenditure, approximately #10,000. Add on #23 if the 'groom --
or, indeed, the best man or bride's father -- had his wedding speech
written for him by Keith Anderson, who runs a confidential mail order
service from his home in Bristol for those unaccustomed to public
speaking. Monica could recoup some of the costs by selling her cream
coloured silk wedding dress through The Herald (a #3000 Harrods gown was
advertised recently at half-price).
A relatively cheap method of clothing yourself on the big day is to
hire a gown. Most customers of the dress hire agency, Gretna Green
Brides, conveniently situated opposite the famous Gretna registrar's
office, come in to choose their frock a day or two before the wedding.
However, the owner relates that last year, a woman who had been told by
her long-term partner that he was taking her and their two children on
an outing to an amusement park, subsequently drove to Gretna and
informed her that they were, in fact, getting married in half-an-hour.
She rushed into the shop in considerable alarm. ''He's invited all our
friends and relatives and even booked a reception,'' said the agitated
bride-to-be, who was in jeans and trainers, ''but he never thought that
I might want to wear a wedding dress.''
Gretna Green Brides sorted her out, including shoes, tights, and veil,
for #200. Very simple gowns, however, can be hired for as little as #50,
and if you decide to hold the reception at one of Scotland's numerous
Orange Halls, wedding costs could be kept down to under four figures.
Said the bar steward at Springburn Orange Hall in Glasgow: ''We can do
a three-course, sit-down meal for 100 guests with a choice of chicken,
steak pie, or gammon steak for #3.50 a head and still make a profit.''
He added that July was, of course, the busiest month for Orange
weddings, particularly around the twelfth.
Although #7000-plus is reckoned to be the average cost of a
traditional British wedding, it's probably double that for a traditional
Asian British wedding, according to the London-based Asian bridal
magazine, Wedding Affair. Indeed, an Asian wedding specialist revealed
that one customer recently spent #80,000 on his daughter's marriage.
Scottish couples looking for a really cheap wedding should probably
get married in England or Wales. During my research, I discovered that
while a standard registrar's office service north of the Border costs
#67, you can get the same thing down south for #39. None of the
Government officials to whom I spoke could tell me why.

Royalty, film stars, the rich and famous: they all came alike to Scots
photographer
Brodrick Haldane. However, although bred in the purple, he contrived
to retain
a degree of objective detachment that enables him to comment, with
total
frankness, on the character of, among others, the Duke and Duchess of
Windsor.
Wendy Jack meets a man who became almost as well-known as his subjects
IN A fine Georgian flat in Edinburgh's New Town, surrounded by family
heirlooms and with an aviary lively with canaries and strawberry
finches, lives Brodrick Haldane, one of the century's best-known society
photographers. Now approaching 83, he lives quietly among the
memorabilia of a glamorous life filled with royalty, aristocrats, film
stars, and the rich and famous.
Yet it is clear that, through all this, Haldane has remained to an
extent on the outside, very individual, an observer, one who is
interested in others, can enjoy good company, yet retains a certain
degree of objective detachment. The profile describes many who practise
the craft of journalism.
Brodrick Vernon Haldane was born in Edinburgh in July, 1912. His
aristocratic family lived during his early years in Inverness-shire. In
1918, his father inherited Gleneagles in Perthshire: ''There were four
Earls of Camperdown, they were Haldane-Duncans,'' he explained. ''The
last earl went to live in Canada in 1918. He had no children, and made
Gleneagles over to my father. Haldanes have owned Gleneagles since the
twelfth century.''
Moving from the informal lifestyle they had all enjoyed in the
Highlands -- going to luncheons and dinners by boat, in oilskins and
wellington boots -- to the grand formality of Perthshire society came as
a big shock. ''The sacred herd'' was what Brodrick Haldane's mother
called these stiff and arrogant families, while her youngest, honing his
talents for observation, concluded that it was their lack of
conversational skills that made them stand-offish.
After prep school in Sussex, he went on to Lancing: ''I got too old to
follow my brother, Alex, to Harrow because I couldn't do the exam, so I
went to Lancing by mistake. My prep school headmaster took me in his car
for an interview without telling anyone. We met the headmaster, a
terrifying man who asked me a few questions, then talked about Scotland,
and I passed into Lancing.''
While he didn't dislike school, Haldane felt he ''did everything the
wrong way''. On exeats, when asked what he'd like to do, he would elect
to visit the lobbies of grand hotels, where his delight was watching
people. His first sortie into working for newspapers and magazines was
writing articles about the characters who lived in the cottages in
Glencoe, across the water from his old home, and he illustrated his work
with photographs.
He had a brief flirtation with acting for a year, earning #5 a day as
a film extra at Elstree, then working on stage for a time, which helped
his fragile confidence. But he hankered for journalism. ''I did want to
work for newspapers, it's very curious, I don't know why. I remember
looking over my nurse's shoulder as she read the gossip columns. I was
fascinated. Something must have triggered me.''
In his early days, he got five shillings (25p) a picture. ''I used a
Kodak postcard camera that you pulled out with bellows. At that time
no-one knew what I was doing. Press photographers used huge cameras, and
took about one shot an hour. I arrived at the scene and mopped it all up
in half an hour. Once they got to know that, though, I had a lot of
trouble.''
While his family raised no objection to his becoming a
photo-journalist, other than his father expressing concern that he would
not be a nuisance, society friends were quite another matter. ''They
were very tiresome, and ashamed to admit that they knew a photographer.
They were also frightened that everybody would say they were making up
to me to get their picture in the papers, so they tended to ignore me.''
His first pictures for Tatler, The Sketch, and Bystander were taken at
a Conservative fete at Glamis Castle, he recalls. ''All the titles
belonged to the same firm and came out weekly until the war. After that
it all changed. I got sent abroad, always to the same places: St Moritz
in winter, Monte Carlo twice in summer and autumn. The people and places
were always the same.''
When he started out, other photographers, he says, ''hated me. I was
supposed to be rich and taking away the bread of workers, but I didn't
have more than #100 a year from my father. There was resentment, too, at
my entree into society. I could get into places they couldn't, it wasn't
fair really. Sometimes I'd be pelted with stones and mud. It was very
rough.''
Developing a ''hide'', or becoming blase with his exposure to the
world's famous names, simply wasn't Haldane's style. He admits to a
lifetime of vulnerability, adding: ''They say as you get older you get
tougher. I don't get tougher at all. I am always vulnerable. It was
absolute agony for me sometimes to take photographs, absolute agony,
because I wasn't good when people turned nasty.''
That painful vulnerability, which has burdened him throughout his
life, has nevertheless ensured that his inherent graciousness and
gentleness have remained unchanged. Tony Armstrong-Jones, he says, went
through similar trials.
''Even he was dragged out of his house and debagged; he had a bad time
when he started. Then I met a young man called Patrick Lichfield -- he
hadn't succeeded to the title at that time. He was in the Army and said
he'd like to do what I was doing. I bet him he wouldn't, but gave him
the name of my agent, Camera Press. He never looked back.''
Fate has threaded its way through the fabric of Haldane's life. A
friend of his brother at Harrow, the son of a wealthy Newcastle
industrialist, Sir John Latta, had a sister, Mary. She became a lifelong
friend and supporter of Haldane. Married twice, she lived for half a
century at Lausanne in Switzerland, where she was a noted society
hostess. Haldane spent five or six months annually with her there. ''In
spite of two marriages, neither was a love match. I think she was
lonely,'' he says.
''I loved her so much, she was wonderful and helped me enormously. It
was through her I met all these people I'd never have met otherwise . .
. Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain, Queen Victoria's daughter who lived
next door, Noel Coward, Charlie Chaplin and his wife Oona, Somerset
Maugham, the Queen, Jack Kennedy, Deborah Kerr . . . it was entirely my
friends over my life, you know, who pulled me through.''
The Duke and Duchess of Windsor he got to know well when they first
married and lived in the South of France. ''They were, quite honestly,
rather lonely. She was hideously ugly, but you weren't conscious of
that. She never stopped talking -- like me. She did all the talking,
organised everything. She was like any other American, but a little too
perfect, not a single hair out of place. She was so immaculate I wanted
to ruffle her up a bit. I knew a woman who did hair treatments, she told
me she went to her every morning, she did nothing else you see, but
herself.''
The duke, Haldane reminisces, ''was totally dependent on her. I don't
think he thought he'd be turned out. But what interested my always was
the love between his mother, Queen Mary, and himself. She loved him and
used to put in her letters to him 'I hope your wife is well'. She
refused ever to meet her, and you know why? She would have liked her.''
Today, Haldane is sad that his favourite cousin, Naomi Mitchison, can
no longer manage to come to see him on account of the stairs. ''She was
a Haldane,'' he explained. ''She's amazing, she's never looked in a
glass and goes about looking like a tramp! I've always admired
intellect, I think hers must have come from the other side. The Haldanes
were hard-working and legally-minded, but not that clever.''
As someone who would happily have swopped the myriad lavish parties
for an evening with a good book, Brodrick Haldane is content in his
retirement, albeit annoyed with himself that his memoirs haven't
progressed further . . . the day a flashbulb exploded all over the old
Aga Khan . . . the time he had to run for a ladies' maid after Queen
Victoria Eugenie dropped a lit cigarette-end down her ample bosom. The
memoirs will make fascinating reading.

BARBIE is, to some, the Queen of Trash. To call a woman a Barbie doll
is intended as an insult. But to those who love Barbie, she is a
treasured part of their life. The adults who collect her are often
making up for a childhood they never had. Glenn Mandeville is a buyer
and collector of dolls. He lives and works in Pennsylvania and has
written a history of Barbie called Glenn Mandeville's Doll Fashion and
Anthology and Price Guide.
Says Mandeville: ''I started buying Barbie when I was 12. I started to
buy Ken in 1961 when I fell in love with his boy-next-door image; that's
what I wanted to be, to look like American TV stars such as Troy
Donohue. The girls in my neighbourhood had Barbie, and I was fascinated
by the wardrobe. When I saw the detail, the quality, the personality of
Barbie, it just seemed exciting.''
Last year, Barbie turned 35. She has, in her time, been drawn by Andy
Warhol, photographed by Annie Leibovitz, dressed by Calvin Klein, and
had her hair cut by Vidal Sassoon.
''Barbie came out in 1959,'' says Glenn. ''In 1962 I started to
collect. I was 13. In those days children were still children. The
attraction for us was this tiny, perfect, miniature person. It was the
adults who got nuts about her anatomy, that it seemed too
sophisticated.''
Some adults are still offended by Barbie's body. Last week, Islamic
leaders in Kuwait issued a fatwa against her, putting her in the same
heinous league as Salman Rushdie, which, in my opinion, flatters him. He
antagonised Muslims in The Satanic Verses in a self-conscious attempt to
be controversial. Or maybe it was just through ignorance. Barbie is only
a toy doll, banned and boycotted because she may remind women of their
sexual power.
''Our children must be protected from this evil Western style of
living, in the shaping of the body, the voluptuous fullness of the lips,
and the blonde styling of the hair,'' said a spokesman for the Islamic
Sharia in Kuwait, somewhat hysterically, in both senses of the word.
Barbie must revise her catalogue of fame to include the addendum of
being a scapegoat for the blatant racism of militant Muslims towards a
culture they regard as morally lax, because it allows women substantial
expression. They wouldn't issue a fatwa against Ken.
Thursday sees the publication of an illustrated anthology of
photographs, The Art Of Barbie -- Artists Celebrate The World's
Favourite Doll (Workman, #14.99). More than 100 top designers and
illustrators have contributed.
There is Barbie in a Little Black Dress by Karl Lagerfield, Nude
Barbie Descending a Staircase by Marion Jones, Attack of the 50ft
Barbie, Pickled Barbie, Barbie as Cyber-Bride, Barbie covered in prawns
with the caption ''Put another shrimp on the Barbie, mate''. The book
has allowed Barbie fans to use her as a product; from goddess to bimbo,
from siren to a mere image that can be decimated and put back together
in a collage (Cubist Barbie).
Barbie is all-purpose meat, she is exactly what you want to make her.
No-one grows out of the idea that she is available, malleable; her
clothes and accessories pretty building blocks for the imagination.
Loving eleven-and-a-half inches of Barbie is saying you know how to
make-believe.
''I grew up in a rural area'', remembers Glenn. ''I didn't have the
opportunity to do standard teenage activities. Through Barbie and Ken I
lived my life. I was envious of their ability to do the things they did.
The farmland around me was eventually developed and in eighth grade my
problems were solved. I had friends, I joined the world of the
teenager.''
Humans are always in some kind of emotional state. Childless couples
have dogs. Lonely kids have invisible friends. Strong feelings find a
substitute to avoid redundancy. They find their own way of staying
alive. But Mandeville's parents were not impressed.
''My family were not particularly overwhelmed with my collection of
Barbie and Kens. They decided I could keep them on one condition -- that
I have them on display in my room. They thought this would shame me into
getting rid of them.
''But all my friends fell in love with Barbie. They used to come round
and ask 'What's new?'. So the plan backfired in my parents' face.''
The common denominator in Barbie fans is hidden, as are all the
difficult and secret cravings of the heart. There is no customer
profile. No particular social or economic bracket in which the Barbie
enthusiast belongs. At Barbie conventions, explains Glenn, there are a
thousand different types of people who outwardly provide no clues as to
what they might have in common.
''Anyone from ballerinas to truck drivers. Many men collect Barbie,
because they showed an interest in fashion as a child and it was
discouraged. Now they are older and have money of their own and buy what
they want. There are women who missed out on teenage things. Barbie is
good for making up for all that. The doll as a role model offered
excitement and glamour at a time when girls were told they had no option
but to grow up, get married, and have babies. Here was a teenager who
could travel the globe, go to parties, have careers.''
The attitude of new-age parents who may think that giving a child a
Barbie doll is to condition her into a passive role are lampooned in The
Art Of Barbie. Cartoonists Jay Lynch and Gary Whitney condense the
nature / nurture argument with two hippie parents who give their
daughter a tool-kit.
''She wanted a Barbie, but Sue and I want give our daughter the
opportunity to choose between the traditional female role and her
potential career options,'' they smugly explain to a friend. Cut to
their daughter Phoebe's bedroom. She's lying belly-down on the floor
deep in conversation.
''Barbie, would you go to the prom with me?'' asks the hammer. ''Oh,
Ken, I'd love to,'' says the spanner.
Barbie's a worker. In 1959 she was a teenage fashion model. In 1965 an
Astronaut and Student Teacher. In 1985 a Business Executive,
Veterinarian, and TV News Reporter. In 1992 a Rap Musician, a Marine
Corps Sergeant, Chef, and Presidential Candidate, and in 1994 a Scuba
Diver and Air Force Thunderbird Squadron Leader. Barbie has also had a
menagerie of more than 35 pets including 16 dogs, 10 horses, four cats,
a parrot, a chimpanzee, a panda, a lion cub, a giraffe, and a zebra. A
collection that compares with the Peter Pan of pop, Michael Jackson, and
his backyard zoo.
People who are obsessed with Barbie haven't grown up yet. Without
wanting to sound creepy, it seems that doll collectors carry the same
habit from their childhood into their adult years; of acting out
scenarios and situations before allowing them to become real.
''Sometimes I think I'm too old for this,'' Glenn confides. ''But
Barbie and Ken are entrenched as friends and mirror my life even more.''
If in any doubt about what red-blooded, fully-fledged womanhood should
look like, see Barbie. Barbie is the ultimate female impersonator..
Every successful American female star bears a resemblance. Big eyes, big
hair, full mouth. ''Barbie is an icon of popular culture. People have
Barbie envy, they go to great lengths to look like her,'' says Glenn.
The fact that Barbie is photogenic or cute is not what nauseates her
detractors. It is her lack of individuality, a fact that just doesn't
bother the Americans, Australians, Germans, or Japanese, but absolutely
horrifies the British. The Barbie look is associated with the production
line whence she comes. There are very few Scots or English Barbie types.
If the Barbie look is adopted it is intended as ironic, such as Joanna
Lumley in Absolutely Fabulous.
There are national looks based on desired social status. The Americans
and Australians respect self-made money. A wife should look like Ivana
Trump. A girlfriend like Kylie Minogue. A lover like Elle Macpherson.
Blonde women a la Bardot are frequently rich and therefore isolated from
the usual fashion choices from which the lower-earners select. They
become designer motifs, and are as narrow-minded in shopping only for
designer clothes as is a Glaswegian on insisting on bargains from What
Every Woman Wants. The British, meanwhile, respect class, Jane Seymour,
Julie Andrews, Helena Bonham-Carter.
''This year sees the Baywatch Barbie and Ken,'' Glenn anticipates. ''I
call them period pieces. What can you buy for dollars which appreciates
in value at 20% a year? Some dolls are difficult to locate, already
$1500 before they're found.''
In 1993, on average, more than a million Barbie dolls were sold each
week.An original mint-condition Barbie doll can be valued at more than
$4500.
''What's happening,'' says Glenn, ''is that many collectors are
dabbling -- buying five or six of a doll they think is hot and then
advertising in magazines to raise support for their habit or hobby. It
is an addiction, though not as subversive as others.''
That's a matter of opinion. Maybe Barbie operates on the principle of
the blow-up doll, bought more often for the company than any sexual
gratification.
''There's a Disney quality to Barbie,'' Glenn continues. ''Some may be
Sleeping Beauty or Cinderella. It's a cut-throat business dealing with
dolls, there's competition for collectables. I had to grow up real
quick. But dolls represent a certain innocence, they put a sparkle in
the eye.
''In our country, there is so much social and racial unrest that a
hobby represents time-out. A breather from violence. Anyone who collects
Barbie is reminded of pleasant things. The value is secondary, the
person falls in love. Oh yeah, there are those who brag about what she's
worth, but they'd rather be chained and shackled than sell her.''

EASTER traditionally marks the start of another gardening season.
Hopefully, the weather will improve as April progresses.
Putting vegetable gardens to rights is a top priority, with hasty
digging or day-hire of a rotary cultivator. If you use hen-based
fertilisers, it is a moot point whether you put them on before
cultivation, or after as a surface mulch.
Without being penny-pinching when it comes to applying fertilisers,
there is a lot to be said for local application in rows where plants are
being sown or planted.
Some might argue otherwise, but to me it seems like common sense. Have
fertiliser where the plants most need it.
All cabbage family plants should now be sown, ready for planting out.
The exception is later varieties of cabbages or sprouts.
In the fruit garden, tidy up strawberry plants and remove dead leaves
to prevent them being a source of botrytis disease.
Tie in loose raspberry canes and whip round the whole garden with a
contact weed killer. If you don't mind spending a bit of money, it is a
sound investment to mulch the fruit garden with forest bark.
It helps to keep down weeds and conserves moisture. It is many years
since I put down a deep mulch in the fruit garden, and it is still
reasonably effective. Any weeds that do form seem to be loose-rooted and
easily hoed out.
If you are putting down a new strawberry bed, consider doing this
through black polythene. You will have to anchor it at both sides, by
lapping it into a trench.
For planting the strawberries, at 12-14in apart, put on a pair of
strong gardening gloves and push the runners through the polythene. Let
the leaves stay above the polythene.
You may find things flap a bit, but put some stones down. Usually the
plants will find their own way out, being attracted by the light.
Alternatively, get a barrel with holes in the side. Fill with good
quality soil and push the strawberries in, to give contact with the
soil.
You can get strawberry towers but they are a bit pricy and not as easy
to manage for watering.
Mulching in the shrub section is good practice. It should last for
years. You may be able to get bulk supplies of forest bark if you
inquire around. This is cheaper than in bags.
Finally, now is the time to get busy with combined lawn fertilisers
and moss killers. Watch for that moss browning and blackening. If you
are still not happy about moss kill, go over the lawn again.
Check that all the holes in a distributor are not gummed up. That
would mean uneven application. When satisfied the moss is killed off,
get busy with a wire rake or an electric rake.
In greenhouse and home, keep abreast of pricking out needs. Shade and
water seedlings. Get things in order for the tomato crop. Tie in new
growths on vines. Keep at it.

PORING over Elspeth Gardner's folio of ceramic tiles, it occurs to the
viewer that it's not only the artist who is to be applauded for her
endeavours but also those who, rather than settle for something
mass-produced, decided to take a chance on something unique.
In business for just a couple of years, Elspeth has undertaken more
than half a dozen private and public commissions. These include a
hospice in Stirlingshire, a fish shop in the West End of Glasgow and
several kitchens -- one of them her mum's.
The Strathcarron Hospice job came about through Scottish Healthcare
Arts. The result is a richly-coloured, 5[1/2] by 4[1/2]ft tiled picture
in the entrance hall showing a busy harbour scene with prominent
lighthouse.
''I was playing around with ideas for the picture -- having decided I
was going to avoid doves and that kind of thing -- when a song came on
the radio called There's a Lighthouse in the Harbour by Nanci Griffith,
an American singer I really like.
''It seemed to sum up my feelings about what hospices are for, and
when I discussed it with patients at the day centre they were
enthusiastic, too.
''There needed to be a lot of detail because some people were going to
be seeing it every day, so there's lots of texture and colour with
groups of people walking, picnicking, boating etc.''
Elspeth also likes to make the frame of a picture interesting, and in
this case she decorated it with moulds of shells she collected on the
seashore.
For her mum's kitchen, Elspeth used a much simpler idea but one which
is so attractive that she may reproduce a number of the tiles for her
ready-made range.
She explains: ''My mum, who's a really good cook, was getting the
kitchen completely redone and she said she wanted her favourite recipes,
like upside-down cake and soda scones, printed on tiles.''
Elspeth copied the recipes out in fancy, old-fashioned script and had
them printed in black on to special paper which could then be
transferred on to plain white tiles. These original and ultra-practical
tiles now form a pleasing pattern over the cooker in the Gardner kitchen
in Cambuslang.
Between commissions Elspeth works on her popular range of off-the-peg
decorative tiles, which are sold singly with a hook on the back for
hanging on walls. They are available through craft and trade fairs,
exhibitions, and shops as far apart as Devon and Kirkwall. A committed
environmentalist, her current themes are farm animals, rain forests, and
sea creatures.
When she isn't working on the commissions or the ready-mades Elspeth
fits in a spot of community teaching and even some fireplace renovation,
where new tiles are made to match existing old ones.
''You've got to be flexible to stay in business,'' she explains. ''And
different areas of my work give me different levels of satisfaction.
''Ceramics are somehow friendlier than traditional fine art,'' she
says. ''Perhaps people don't feel so threatened by a picture done in
tiles as they would by a painting.'' Whatever the reasons, people like
Elspeth Gardner's tiles. ''I enjoy making things that people like. I've
never been interested in producing work that was about me as an
artist.''
However, Elspeth admits that her obsession with caravans, which
resulted in several kiln-loads of caravan motif tiles when she first set
up in business, is not one the general ceramic-buying public has been
keen to support. Her thing about caravans goes back to childhood, when
she spent many happy weekends and holidays in the family's fifties-style
caravan at Rosneath (sur Clyde).
When she was allowed carte blanche for a hospital commission in
Stoke-on-Trent, not surprisingly she chose her beloved caravan park as
the theme.
Given her love of caravans, family and friends can't believe her
choice of studio space was an accident. It's at the Laird Business Park
in Dalmarnock and offers a splendid view of the sites in that area that
have been set aside for travelling people.

Summer-flowering bulbs give super results. And that can be with or
without a garden. The idea is to pop them into a well-drained container,
for example, to the correct depth. Place them in a sunny position.
Summer-flowering bulbs will, of course, need regular watering. That's
important. Given the right care, and protection in winter if necessary,
they give good value for money and last for years. It's something the
kids like to give a hand with, too.

LYNN PARK's skills as a metalwork designer have produced some
beautifully crafted pieces. At the beginning of this year, following her
one-woman show in the city, Aberdeen Art Gallery bought a set of oil and
vinegar bottles.
She is pictured here with one of her cone-shaped bottles, which
combines pewter and aluminium, and a collection of her paper knives made
in pewter, brass, and stainless steel.
Lynn Park has exhibited in London and New York as well as Scotland,
and her commissions have included metalwork for Scottish Television's
new arts programme, Out There, and a plaque for a ceremonial chair and
lectern for Caledonian University.
Tomorrow will reveal what she calls ''a love-indulgent project'' when,
as part of Art Feast, Eastwood's first arts festival, her suspended
steel, brass, and perspex pieces, ''created only to sway with the
wind'', will be on show in Rouken Glen Park.

ONE of the most exciting garden centres to be developed in Scotland is
in the Clyde Valley. While the area is only a shadow of its former self,
in terms of hundreds of acres of glasshouses producing succulent Scotch
tomatoes it is still the centre of a considerable horticultural
industry.
The new development comes from the transformation of what was once a
tomato glasshouse unit into a superbly designed garden centre. It is on
a four-acre site, previously lying unused, on the main road from the M74
motorway to Garrion Bridge.
Behind this project is 37-year-old former advertising man Andrew
Sutherland. A keen gardener, with his garden open to the public under
Scotland's Garden Scheme, he has nevertheless no background in the
horticultural industry.
He brings original thinking to the making of a garden centre. ''I had
no preconceived ideas,'' he says. ''I decided to make the garden centre
to meet the needs of ordinary people. It is a place for those who enjoy
gardening.''
A burn which flowed through the site has been diverted to form a
beautiful water feature. In addition there is an extensive children's
play area. Last but not least there is an undercover shopping area.
There is a restaurant complete with terrace, where you can enjoy the
view over the Clyde. Other novel features include a growing house where
customers can select their plants and see them repotted or put into
hanging baskets or containers while they wait.
The whole centre involves a massive capital investment, well into
seven figures, and shows great faith in the future of gardening by
Andrew Sutherland and his family.

done with tropical plants with sufficient warmth in Glasgow's gloomy
climate. It's an uplifting experience to see the orchids, hyacinths,
abutilons, and other spring fare at their very best. Recent damage
caused by gales closed the conservatory for a while, but it is now once

WATER is the lifeblood of all living plants. It is vital that they get
the right amount in the growing season. Over and under-watering is the
biggest reason for plant failure. Fortunately, in this part of the world
we don't suffer too much from drought. But it can happen.
I recall years when lawns turned brown everywhere and outdoor watering
was forbidden. Lawns have remarkable recuperative powers, however.
One cannot say this about all plants, especially those in containers.
There are many premature deaths during holiday periods. The most
sensitive area is in the greenhouse. During hot, sunny days temperatures
can soar alarmingly, to more than 100[DEG]F, and have plants panting for
water.
The tremendous uptake by vigorous tomato plants in growing bags can
create unprecedented demand. To fall by the wayside one can end up with
bad setting of fruit, blotchy ripening, and the dreaded blossom end rot.
While not entirely due to irregular watering, it is closely linked to
it.
Adequate ventilation and shading can help to cut down on watering
needs. For peace of mind lay on capillary beds, irrigation, overhead
sprays, or some other system.
For tomatoes I tried the grow-pot system last year. Plants are grown
in an inner ring and water is supplied to the outer ring of a plastic
container, set into growing bags. Even then there had to be a close
watch to keep the outer ring topped up. A vigorous plant can get through
tremendous volumes of water.
Outdoor facilities are now readily available. They include oscillating
sprayers, sprinklers, and drip systems. It all costs money. There is the
question of evaluating whether the expenditure is worth while. In my
view it certainly is. We have not had drought for any length, in the
west at any rate. It is still better to be prepared.

THIS Easter, why not bring something of the glorious newness of spring
into your home? Ignore the purists who say you cannot successfully mix
daffodils and tulips in the same arrangement. A delightful display can
be made by combining a few of every spring flower you have in the garden
in a glorious mix of colour.
The problem you will have with the new spring growth is its softness,
as at this time of year it is sappy and weak. But there are several
things you can do to make them last longer in water.
Daffodils -- Cut the flowers only and not the leaves, which are needed
to build up the bulb for next year's blooms. Plunge the stem ends at
once into tepid water to prevent the sap clogging the stems. Leave them
to ''drink'' for at least two hours so that the stems are turgid and the
flowers will last well.
Tulips -- These are stubborn, wayward flowers and can change direction
in a matter of hours. You can leave an arrangement, satisfied that it
has a pleasing, downward-flowing curve, and come back later in the day
to discover the tulips are standing rigidly to attention. It helps to
prevent this (although not entirely) if you wrap the bunch of tulips in
a roll of newspaper and stand the stem ends in tepid water for two
hours, as for the daffs. If a tulip brought from a florist wilts quickly
once it is arranged, it is because an air lock has got into the stem
while it was out of water, in transit. Pierce the stem of the tulip just
below the head, stand it in tepid water to just below the head, and it
should revive quickly.
Cherry blossom -- Cut the branches, just before the flowers open
fully, with secateurs below a bud or leaf joint. Prune selectively to
shape the tree. Plunge the stem ends into a pan of boiling water for 10
seconds, shielding the blossom from the heat with brown paper. Leave to
stand in tepid water for two hours.
Flowering currant -- This isn't popular for flower arrangements
because it smells unpleasantly of cats when it is first brought into the
house. Treat the stem ends as above and stand overnight in warm water,
when the smell will disappear. Incidentally, if the stems of flowering
currant are picked in tight bud and brought into the house to force them
into early bloom, they have no smell at all when they flower.
Primroses, polyanthus, and grape hyacinths -- These are delightful
placed low down in a flower display, but the stems are too soft to
insert into oasis. Put them into a small container, such as the plastic
container a film is packed in, and push this into the oasis. Or lift the
plant, roots and all with a soil ball, wrap it in cling film and place
it among the other flowers. When it has finished flowering replant it in
the garden.
To make the arrangement shown here you will need:
A shallow dish; one third of a block of ''standard'' oasis (the soft
stems will pierce this more readily than the ''superior'' oasis); spring
flowers -- daffodils, narcissi, tulips; branches of prunus blossom;
sprigs of rosemary; flowering currant; large ivy leaves.
Wedge the soaked oasis in the dish. Place a curving branch of blossom
in the centre and towards the back of the dish and two branches to the
sides, outlining a triangular shape. Add shorter curving branches of
blossom coming forwards at the base. Insert short sprigs of feathery
rosemary between the branches and some flowering currant complete with
leaves.
Follow this outline with curving stems of tulips. Fill in with
daffodils and narcissi, cut them to varying lengths, and bring some to
the front so that the arrangement is not flat or one-dimensional.
Finally, conceal the oasis with large variegated ivy leaves.

BASEMENT flats have the reputation of being damp and dingy but that's
not necessarily so. Basements also have their advantages, like their own
garden and main door. Often they are cheaper to buy and are cosier than
the high-ceiling flats above. Sometimes basement owners are not liable
for roof repairs.
The basement, however, does have some particular problems with
refurbishment. Basements are prone to damp and an efficient damp-proof
course is essential. Treating dampness can entail a massive exercise of
digging out the earth the building sits on. Special insulation
techniques like chemical injection or Newton Lath plastic membrane used
between the bare stone and the plaster of soil-retaining walls can solve
the problem.
Any good surveyor will be able to detect the amount of moisture in
walls and this should be in the surveyor's report.
''If you've got a damp-proof course that has not been done properly
you're not just talking about having to do all the damp-proofing work
again but ripping out all the decor as well,'' says Alan Renfrew, whose
refurbishing firm Edinburgh Mansions Ltd has spectacularly renovated a
lower ground-floor flat. Currently up for sale, the two-floor apartment
is in Edinburgh's New Town, and shows how good design and lighting can
transform the image of a basement.
A general practice surveyor may well recommend that if you are really
serious about buying a basement flat with damp problems you should seek
further specialist advice. Get a couple of damp-proofing companies to do
a report and give a quote. Damp is not incurable and treating it need
not be expensive or time-consuming.
Often you can smell dampness as soon as you enter a house. Some
damp-proofing and rot contractors now use dogs to sniff out damp. ''The
way to consider taking on a basement is to assume that it has dampness
unless the person selling it can produce the guarantees from the company
who fitted it,'' says Alan Renfrew.
Preplanning is important, especially if you are taking a basement back
to its shell. Your architect will be able to advise. ''If you're really
serious about buying the property you want a quantity surveyor to cost
the work involved,'' says Alan Renfrew. If a new dampcourse is being
fitted it could be to your advantage. New plaster means that you'll have
perfectly smooth walls and can have a new sunken wall and ceiling
lights.
''You want to think carefully about lighting. Basements are usually
darker than the flats above and spot or halogen lights have a lot to
offer in basements,'' says Alan. Halogen lights are bright and crisp,
like daylight, and are ideal for poorly-lit rooms.
Lighting is also an important factor in security, a major
consideration in a basement flat which can be prey to burglars. Remote
control lights which switch on when an infra-red light is activated are
ideal for basements.
Windows can be fitted with security gates rather than rigid bars. They
can be made to measure by a blacksmith and need not be expensive if you
shop around. If you're working with a listed building you will have to
check out anything like burglar alarms or window gates . . . your
architect will have to do a drawing and have it approved.

THINK of stained glass and an image of a church window probably
springs to mind. However, stained glass can also be used in the home to
great effect, and not just in exterior windows: you could incorporate
stained glass in a bathroom or a kitchen door, for example.
A company in Edinburgh will design and produce stained glass for your
home to fit in with existing colours and decor or simply as a decorative
item in its own right.
The Edinburgh Stained Glass House has been in its present location for
seven years, although the proprietor, Britta Sugden, has been making
stained glass for 20 years, and was originally based in Aberdeen.
''When I lived in America in the 1970s I went on a course to learn how
to make stained glass,'' explains Britta.
''The American approach to stained glass was very exciting -- people
would experiment with different colours and designs and produced much
more decorative results. They were also prepared to use it a lot more in
their homes, mainly for windows and doorways.
''When the course finished, the studio offered me a job, so when we
moved back to Scotland I decided to set up my own studio,'' says Britta.
''I buy a lot of glass direct from the US, where most of the best
modern glass comes from, as well as from Europe,'' says Britta. ''There
is a tremendous choice available, raning from pale, opaque colours to
deep reds, blues, and greens.
''Nowadays most glass is machine-made. Only one firm in Britain still
makes mouth-blown glass, which is not uniform like machine-made glass
but contains bubbles and streaks, which I think are very pleasing
effects. However, mouth-blown glass is much more expensive than
machine-made glass, and it depends on what effect you are looking for.''
Edinburgh Stained Glass has worked in hotels and offices as well as in
churches and private homes. Among the work it has been asked to
undertake are restoration of the windows at Aberdeen Town Hall and a
commission for the Bank of Scotland's Press Awards.
''One of our recent commissions was to make a piece of glass depicting
Napier University's coat of arms, which was presented to the university
by the retiring principal,'' says Britta. This now hangs in the Turmeau
Hall at the university's Craiglockhart site in Edinburgh.
''As well as these commissions we are often asked to repair or replace
stained glass in private homes, both in this country and abroad,'' adds
Britta.
''For instance, many Victorian houses have stained glass in front-door
panels or fanlights, or in a stair window. The lead generally lasts for
about 80 years, after which time it will need releading.
''We will also design and make stained glass to go in other rooms --
for the bathroom or kitchen, for example, to complement an existing
furnishing style or simply create a decorative effect.''
Says Britta: ''You can have just about anything you want -- flowers,
birds, and animals, or buildings, or simply a pattern made using
different coloured glass. It could be a small design within a window or
the whole window, a small item like a plant holder or a mirror or a
stained-glass Tiffany-style lampshade. All you need is some
imagination.''
Britta runs courses in stained glass throughout the year, at beginner
or advanced level, and insists that anyone can learn the techniques
involved. So, if you've always fancied adding some colour and interest
to that bathroom window or front-door panel, why not try your hand at
making a stained-glass design for it?
Alternatively, Edinburgh Stained Glass House will design and make one
to your specifications. It also supplies all the necessary materials for
stained-glass making.

PEELS is another quick-cheat stained glass option, this time using
stick-on designs which are placed on conservatories, shower screens, or
fanlights for example. The idea is to give the impression of stained
glass with the minimum work and outlay.
Peels of London do a wide range of patterns, from art nouveau to
flowers, birds, figures, and mosaic effects in a choice of sizes. All
the designs but one (examples pictured right) have a textured background
to emulate stained glass, and if privacy is required -- as in the case
of a plain glass door -- designs can be ordered with an overall
frosting.
As to price, designs within the company's standard 37[1/2]inX26[1/2]in
size costs #23.99 with small window designs of 19in by 26[1/2]in,
#14.99.
It is essential to follow the instructions provided to the letter in
order to get the most successful result. Peels of London can be
contacted on 0181-948 0689.

ONCE upon a time, nurseries were places decorated in palest pastels.
Babies and small children, it seemed, were destined to spend their
earliest years exposed to nothing stronger than anaemic yellows, pinks,
and blues.
But all that is long past. Today's tinies have visual stimulation from
every quarter: vibrant colours, bright, interesting patterns on wall
coverings and fabrics, all joining forces to create truly imaginative
rooms.
Demonstrating the point admirably is Laura Ashley's Circus Circus
collection. There's a glorious grouping of rope-climbing clowns for the
wallpaper with its white backdrop, while the zingy citrus yellow fabric
-- also available in bed linen -- dances with little figures busily
engaged in clowning and juggling. A deep border pulls together all the
fun and atmosphere of the big top.
Complementing all this is a range of accessories. There's a rather
nice -- and not too ''busy'' -- headboard at #65, in plain yellow with
just a few clowns arched across its top for decoration; a toy box which
costs #95; a lampshade at #14.95, and a wonderful patchwork quilt,
priced at #85.
While some will love the effect of a whole room decorated with the
Circus Circus collection, others may find it a bit too frenetic. They
could opt instead for plain walls with perhaps the fabric, border,
headboard, and toy box to give a quieter, calmer room that still has
plenty of colour and interest.
From the same designer comes another appealing idea in the
co-ordination of a discreetly spotted polkadot wallpaper and unusual
''bookshelf'' border, teamed with gaily striped curtains and cushions
highlighted with contrasting fabric.
For teeny-weenies, Marks and Spencer's Teddy nursery range includes a
cute teddy bear and his pals, a bunny and a mouse, all dressed in
gingham. The latter is repeated on the frilled cot quilt, which has a
blue background colour.
There's a matching cot bumper, and a flat white cot sheet bound with
gingham and appliqued with the teddy design. The quilt and bumper each
cost #25 and fit a standard UK cot, while the sheet is #15.

AS Disneyland Professor of Bad Taste at the University of Camelon, I
am often asked strange questions at parties. In the most recent case, a
punter limped across to me and said: ''Doctor . . .''
I backed away, protesting that I was not that kind of doctor. Consult
your GP, I said. He protested that he knew perfectly well I wasn't a
medical man: for a start, I wasn't chain-smoking. In any case, the limp
was caused by a stone in his shoe which he couldn't remove because the
knot in his laces had ''gone Gordian''. The classical reference made me
stay and listen.
He said he would never have the bad taste to consult a medical man
about limps at parties. He wanted to talk to me about matters of taste.
That, I thought, is just as bad, but carry on.
He'd read an article in one of those trendy magazines about a woman
who'd bought an old schoolhouse somewhere, established a few hives and
set up in business making beeswax candles. This was so successful that
she'd moved the business into a factory unit, and started to sell
bobeche as well as candles. Then she'd married an architect, who
completely redesigned the old schoolhouse, and they were living happily
ever after as the magazine went to press.
Was this story, he asked, an example of good taste or bad? I sipped my
designer lager from the neck (we authorities have to maintain
party-cred, after all) and thought for a moment. Then I gave my
judgment: he had described a fascinating scenario in which good taste
and bad jostled for position.
Take the beeswax candles, I said. These are frightfully good taste.
They cost very much more than ordinary candles, yet they don't do a
better job than ordinary candles in a power cut. But the only people who
would light them in a power cut show bad taste, displaying their wealth
in an ostentatious fashion.
Buying an old schoolhouse, I continued, was definitely good taste --
but only under certain circumstances. If you could afford to do it up,
to remove the aura of ink and rotting gym shoes, you were guaranteed a
feature in a trendy magazine. But if you couldn't, and the old
schoolhouse continued to look like an old schoolhouse with squatters
aboard, it's bad tasteville.
However, it was certainly good taste to marry an architect. Many
people do. But under these circumstances a sensible woman would have
married a plumber, and while some might consider this bad taste it was
certainly more practical, if you look through a few household bills. Who
has ever had to pay #50 to call out an ''emergency architect''?
The punter looked puzzled. ''Sorry,'' he said. ''But all I wanted to
know was what bobeche means.'' Ah, I said, I'm with you now. It's the
French word for a candle sconce, so therefore it's a candle sconce with
good taste. Although it's pretentious and bad taste to use the word.
''Thanks,'' he said, backing away. These victories are hard won.

STAINED glass used to be the prerogative of churches, important
buildings, and fine old houses. These days, though, it has ''come out''
with new technology and materials which have made available slot-in
panels which can be added to windows, doors, conservatories, fanlights,
for example, at reasonable cost.
Classic Stained Glass Designers at Milngavie, which was set up at the
beginning of this year, has seen a burgeoning demand for its
stained-glass insets. From young to elderly home owners, in modern or
traditional houses, many people have shown themselves to be keenly
interested in adding colourful, imaginative design to their windows and
doors.
One of the company's four directors, Mrs Shirley Gilmour, says:
''Stair windows are very popular. So are feature windows in small rooms.
Another good idea is to use stained glass to screen an unattractive
view.
''The technique we use,'' she continues, ''is done with an overlay
rather than the traditional stained glass, which is very expensive
because it's so time-consuming to make. Toughened glass can also benefit
from our method, and it is possible for us to replicate any traditional
windows that exist in an old house.''
In design terms the sky's the limit, while the colours on offer cover
the spectrum. People can point to a particular design they'd like
copied, or give their own ideas. Those who require a bit of help, says
Mrs Gilmour, ''are visited by our co-director, Frank MacKenzie, who will
do a sketch, then we provide a full design service.''
Average time from start to finish will be about three weeks. Costs are
obviously very variable, depending on the simplicity or complexity of
the design, but most, Shirley Gilmour says, ''are very surprised at how
inexpensive it is''.
By way of example she points to a plan on the drawing board for a pair
of bathroom windows approximately 12in by 32in and 18in by 32in. ''To do
these with a bamboo and lily design works out at about #270 inclusive of
VAT,'' she explains. ''The colours can be co-ordinated with the interior
scheme of the room.''
How is it all done?
It's put on to glass, leaded, the colours applied, and it's bonded to
the existing glass. The lead is actually applied to show on both sides
of the glass, and can be varied both in its thickness and in its colour;
the glass can either be clear or opaque.''
In addition to commercial inquiries from hotels and restaurants, for
example, the company is currently working on some diamond leaded glass
for a church, proving, if proof were needed, that even such traditional
venues are content to avail themselves of this well-priced,
authentic-looking alternative.
* Classic Stained Glass Designers are at 28 Crossveggate (Milngavie
railway station car park, Milngavie).

Retired from the Scots Guards,
Brodie of Brodie dedicated
the rest of his life to daffodils.
Lesley Duncan recounts
how the latest son of the castle
carries on a proud tradition
SOME good poems have been written about them -- take a bow Wordsworth
and Herrick. They have inspired much atrocious verse. Daffodils that is.
After sun-starved northern winters, their bursts of flagrant yellow
signal spring, renewal, new life. No wonder they are loved and
cultivated everywhere from suburban patch and motorway verge to
municipal garden and private estate.
Brodie Castle, near Nairn, can boast a daffodil story of its own. In
the 1890s, the 24th Brodie of Brodie retired from the Scots Guards when
he inherited the estate. With a competent farm manager in place, he
needed something else to do. ''What put him on to daffodils, I don't
know,'' says his son, the present Brodie.
Whatever the inspiration, the senior Brodie spent the next 50 or more
years until his death in l943, producing new daffodil cultivars, some
400 in all. Records were meticulously kept. The National Trust for
Scotland has access to these floral ''stud books'', as Robert Grant, a
garden adviser to the trust, puts it. For some time now, a hunt has been
on to find missing varieties of the Lent lily, as daffodils are also
known. Some may be blooming in a garden near you. But does a Brodie
daffodil look different from its golden neighbours? ''To the trained
eye, yes,'' says Grant, ''but probably not to you or me.''
What are the characteristics of the Brodie bulbs? The 25th Brodie
thinks his father ''went more for'' large cups and trumpets than
perfection as such. His father was also a pioneer of ''pink'' daffodils.
''Loch Maree was one of the best of the pinks,'' he recalls. ''It had a
large trumpet and used to pale off into white.'' Another notable pink
was Rose of Scotland.
Brodie is not sure how many of the original 400 are still growing at
Brodie Castle. He believes there may be about half that number, either
planted in grass or in the walled garden. A lot of people have sent in
bulbs, no doubt hoping for a Brodie original. Have there been any
discoveries? Sadly not, it appears. ''I think we knew them or had had
them here,'' says Brodie.
He also points out that a lot of the Brodie daffodils have been
''surpassed'' by more recent varieties. But does bigger or brighter, or
even stronger, necessarily mean better when the aesthetic appeal of
flowers is being judged? With a personal taste for the smaller, paler,
woodland daffs, I would say not. In any case, the hunt for the missing
Brodies remains the most pleasant of quests.
When I spoke to Dr Stephanie Blackden, the national trust's property
manager at Brodie, the castle daffodils were still to come into full
bloom -- although there was already a carpet of wild ones among the
shrubs. Weather co-operating, there should be a fine display this
weekend, both in the main grounds (mostly, however, more modern
varieties) and in the four-acre walled garden where the public don't go.
Here rows and rows of Brodie daffodils are cultivated and identified.
Some bulbs are planted out, others sent to the Scottish Agricultural
College at Auchincruive in Ayrshire for scientific propagation.
George Bryden of the college describes the procedure. They were sent
some cultivars two summers ago -- 11 different varieties in all. ''We
cleaned them up, potted them in compost, and let them flower.'' After
they died back in summer, they were propagated by the technique of
chipping (cutting the bulbs into 4, 8, or 16 pieces, depending on size).
These chippings were then placed in the inert growing medium of
vermiculite in poly bags till they started to sprout. Then the chips
were taken out of the bags and put in compost in trays. All is going
well, although the plants are unlikely to flower this spring because
they are so small. They have also been cleared of viruses.
Bryden reiterates the reason for this elaborate exercise. The original
stock had degenerated to the extent that in some cases only one or two
bulbs existed. ''Some lovely varieties were in danger of dying out.''
The group of cultivars Auchincruive has been tending include Hunter's
Moon, Fortune's Beauty, and Loch Fyne. There is a wide spectrum of
characteristics, he notes -- some large, some small, some more scented
than others -- but ''there were some lovely daffodils when they were
blooming last year.'' Their numbers may not rival Wordsworth's ten
thousand at a glance. But at least the Brodie daffodils are in caring
hands. Long may they flourish.
ON THE GOLDEN TRAIL
DAFFODIL admirers can indulge their eyes elsewhere in Scotland this
weekend. For example, in the 60 acres of Threave School of Gardening,
Castle Douglas. There are some 400 daffodil cultivars in this beautiful
working garden, the legacy of Major Alan Gordon who gave the property to
the trust in 1947. One particular bank has several thousand Southern
Gems, dating back to 1924. The gardens are open daily from 9.30am to
sunset.
Throughout the year Culzean Castle and Country Park, Ayrshire, draws
hosts of visitors to its woodlands, gardens, swan pond, and clifftop
walks with their spectacular views of Arran and Ailsa Craig. The great
Adam mansion and visitors' quadrangle are open again for the season.
Daffodils scattered throughout the woodlands are currently adding to
Culzean's manifold attractions. The country park is open daily from 9.30
to sunset; castle and visitors' centre from 10.30 to 5.30.
Across the firth, Brodick Castle grounds are also brightened by
daffodils scattered through the gardens, on the castle banks, and among
the rhododendrons of Brodick's notable collection. A springfeast of
colour set against the rocky slopes of Goatfell. On Monday a new path --
the Plant Hunter's Walk -- is being inaugurated. Garden and country park
are open daily from 9.30 to sunset; the castle daily from 11.30 to 5.
Near Glasgow, Finlaystone overlooking the Clyde on the A8 west of
Langbank, has ''plenty of daffodils'' to admire -- including some
authentic Brodie ones, according to the owner, Mrs G. MacMillan. The
gardens are open throughout the year from 10.30 to 5. There are also
woodland walks with waterfalls, picnic and play areas, and a visitors'
centre with Celtic art exhibition. The house with doll collection and
Victorian kitchen is open on Sunday afternoons.
To the north of the Clyde, the woodland garden at Glenarn, Rhu,
Dunbartonshire, is open daily until June 21 from sunrise to sunset. A
burn flows through the woodland garden. Daffodils, primulas, and
bluebells flower in season, among a notable collection of rhododendron
species and hybrids. Restoration work is in progress on a pond. There is
a collection box; dogs must be kept on leads; and cars are not allowed
up the drive. Approach is by the A814 between Helensburgh and
Garelochhead. A regular bus service stops at Rhu Marina.
Open tomorrow (2-6) is the seventeenth-century Winton House,
Pencaitland. Indoors, there are fine pictures and furnishings to admire.
The garden has masses of daffodils. Approach by the A6093 or B6355.
Further openings to look forward to:
Next Sunday, visitors to the Duke and Duchess of Montrose's property
at Auchmar, Drymen, can savour the spectacular display of daffodils
leading down to a river walk and waterfall. (Two-and-a-half miles from
Drymen on the B837 Balmaha road, open 2 to 5pm).
Daffodils and a rhododendron walk are on offer at Colstoun,
Haddington, on Saturday, 2 to 5pm. Auchmacoy, Ellon, has daffodils in
Wordsworthian profusion; it's open next Sunday from 1.30 to 4.30pm.
Foxhall, Kirkliston, is also open next Sunday, 2 to 5.30pm. Daffodils, a
woodland walk, and badger setts are among its attractions.

GLASGOW'S growing reputation as Britain's boxing capital soared even
higher yesterday with the news that London promoter Frank Warren, who
recently signed a multi-million-pound deal with Sky Television, plans to
stage at least three world-title fights in the city within the next 18
months.
The first will go ahead in September and it will probably involve
Nigel Benn, who retained his World Boxing Council super-middleweight
champion title in the ill-fated fight against America's Gerald McClellan
in London in February.
On his two previous visits, Benn has made a big impression with the
fans.
Also on the September bill will be Sheffield's Prince Naseem Hamed,
who, by then, hopes to be world super-bantamweight champion. Unbeaten
Hamed has been adopted by the Scottish boxing public and the little man
makes no secret of the fact that he relishes his trips north of the
Border.
The ventures will be jointly promoted by Warren and Alex and Katherine
Morrison, in association with the Glasgow City Council, and will be part
of the Sky deal under which the same promoters will stage five nursery
shows in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Livingston.
These shows will be mainly to promote young Scottish talent, but each
will be headed by a 12-round contest for British, Commonwealth, or WBC
Continental championships.
Said Alex Morrison yesterday: ''I am delighted that I have put
together this package with Frank Warren. We have worked well in the
past, and I think what finally swung things our way was the response to
next month's show at the Kelvin Hall, which features Frank Bruno against
Ray Anis in the first of the television shows. It is all good news for
Scottish boxing, the fans, and the boxers themselves.''
Tickets for the Bruno event have been selling rapidly, and Morrison
confirmed the undercard yesterday.
Dennis Andries, who won the British cruiserweight title in Glasgow in
January, will make his first defence against Vauxhall's Terry Dunstant,
while British welterweight champion Del Bryan, of Nottingham, defends
against Gary Logan, of Brixton.
The main Scottish interest will centre on Glasgow lightweight Dave
Anderson, who will meet an American opponent over 12 rounds. Moodiesburn
feather Brian Carr is scheduled to meet Newcastle's Paul Wynn, and
Glasgow welter Gordon Blair, who had an oustanding win over Ireland's
Olympic medallist Michael Carruth in January, will take on the highly
rated Chris Saunders, of Barnsley.

THERE are tiles and tiles. There are tilers and tilers . . . vin
ordinaire versus champagne. Jacqui Murphy, tiler extraordinary,
represents the latter with her brilliant, exclusive tile and mosaic
designs that she hand-paints and fires herself.
Commercial settings, domestic settings, choose the venue and
33-year-old Jacqui will transform it. Once the creative bit is over, no
prima donna she, it's a quick shin up the ladder to fix the tiles. A
total package is what's on offer here. She'll even arrange the painting
effects for the walls if necessary, adding her own finishing touch in
the form of stencilling or whatever.
Currently, Jacqui Murphy -- who works also in Glasgow -- is
approaching the completion of a big commercial job at the
privately-owned Caledonian Ale House by Haymarket Station in Edinburgh.
Here, her eye-catching mosaics in vivid turquoise, royal blue, and
emerald green have been inspired by ancient Celtic patterns, which she
has updated superbly.
Having had a total design brief for this contract, she has been able
to extend her ideas outward from the tiling to embrace the whole
interior, from the walls, which she has had painted with special
techniques, then stencilled, again using Celtic themes which are echoed,
too, on the table tops, all the way to a border on the window blinds. A
blacksmith is creating door handles for the atmospheric upstairs room,
using the graceful head and neck of the swan-like bird which is the
centrepiece of the mosaics.
Several prestigious businesses in Edinburgh feature the work of Qui
Designs, as the company is called, but domestic commissions are also
very much welcomed and are the sector in which Jacqui's work began.
''I like each fresh challenge as it comes along. No two jobs are the
same, and that's nice,'' she enthuses. ''Some people have their own
ideas, others want me to create something. I always visit customers'
houses to see what style they've got and take it from there, perhaps
tying in an idea with an item in the room.
''I've never repeated a design; each is totally individual. If I
return to anything it will always be a variation, not a repeat. I
provide drawings of my ideas so that people can see exactly what they
will be getting.''
Her tiling prices can be almost as low as those from mass-produced
sources when the design is very simple. But since each job is
individual, it has to be priced according to the work involved.
Mosaic, at #100 a square foot, is very expensive indeed, but looking
at the finished effect, and considering the cutting up into many pieces
of each tile, its hand-painting and firing, not to mention piecing it
all together, is enough to induce nightmares in the most avid jigsaw
puzzle fan.
Jacqui smiles as she recalls a pair of walruses she created for a
bathroom wall in an Edinburgh flat: ''The two girls who owned it said
they'd never feel fat getting into the bath again,'' she laughs. Another
house outside the capital has a magnificent several-feet-high
trompe-l'oeil effect tiled mural of a cheese plant in a striking
blue-and-white pot.
For someone who spent 10 years as a hairdresser and has had no formal
art training, Jacqui's talents are quite remarkable. Edinburgh College

DISGRACED Manchester United midfield player Roy Keane yesterday
publicly apologised for the stamping incident that looks set to cost him
an FA Cup final appearance.
The Republic of Ireland internationalist broke his silence on the
incident which led to his sending-off for violent conduct during
United's 2-0 FA Cup semi-final victory over Crystal Palace at Villa Park
on Wednesday.
Keane, who must now serve an automatic three-match ban, also faces an
FA disrepute charge after having stamped on Palace captain Gareth
Southgate and is unlikely to play again this season.
''I would like to apologise for the incident. I know I let the club
and myself down and deserved to be sent off,'' Keane is quoted as saying
in the Manchester Evening News.
''What I want to explain, though, is that I intended no disrespect to
the supporter who died and I don't think I really hurt my opponent.''
United manager Alex Ferguson and his Palace counterpart Alan Smith
both made public appeals for calm following the death of 35-year-old
Palace supporter Paul Nixon when fighting broke out between fans before
the clubs' first meeting last Sunday.
The incident, and the ensuing fracas that led to both Keane and
Palace's Darren Pattereson being shown the red card by Harrow referee
David Elleray, added to the list of woes that have hit the game this
season.
Keane added: ''I know it was important that we should all have
behaved, but I am afraid I simply lost control for a moment. It all
happened in a flash.''
United said yesterday that the player had decided to apologise before
the FA made their decision on Thursday to charge him with bringing the
game into disrepute.
Keane and Patterson face severe sanctions, according to Football
Association chief executive Graham Kelly.

TILES, one of the forgotten features of interior design, are coming in
from the cold.
A modern alternative to slates for roofing, indoors tiles have been
more or less confined to a functional splash-back role in kitchens and
bathrooms.
They dispensed with their cold, clinical image some time ago, yet too
many of us do not give tiles the status they deserve in our homes. At
least that's the view of the British Ceramic Tile Council, the
professional body for the tile industry in this country.
According to Yvonne Orgill of the BCTC, we should be looking outside
bathrooms when we think about tiles.
''Italians buy seven times as many ceramic tiles as we do,'' she
explained. ''They remember that tiles have been favoured for walls and
flooring in palaces and temples for more than 4000 years.
''They know, too, that tiles can be used with great style and effect
in every room of the house, not just in palazzos.''
The merger of modern technology and the age-old craft has introduced
new dimensions to the tile world. With so many designs, shapes, and
sizes, tiles can be used to give almost any room a distinctive and
individual touch.
Mixing and matching plain and patterned tiles can produce a myriad of
themes, and the interior design boundaries are almost limitless.
As well as being used in the bathroom, shower-room, or kitchen, tiles
can transform living rooms, dining rooms, even hallways -- and even have
practical advantages in gardens and garages.
''Ceramic tiles last virtually forever,'' points out Yvonne Orgill.
''They offer real value for money and provide a hard-wearing,
attractive, and quality look to walls and floors.
''More and more interior designers are using them in dining rooms,
where very striking effects can be created.''
In dining rooms they have an added practical advantage, because tiles
can be quickly and easily wiped clean of spilled food.
The use of tiles in Scottish sitting rooms is rare despite the fact
they can be a clever alternative to wallpaper, especially up to dado
level, and could be an artistic substitute to fitted carpets or polished
wood floors.
''With strategically placed rugs, tiles offer a long-lasting surface
with many practical advantages, not least the opportunity to change
colour schemes,'' points out Yvonne Orgill.
Among the most startling new ideas to arrive in the modern tile
spotlight is a new black-and-white collection from Pilkington, whose
spokesperson explained: ''The beauty of the collection lies in the
contrast between the plain field tiles and the striking classic
geometric style tiles. The combination options are almost endless, with
the three-dimensional designs of the strip tiles creating interesting
and often startling trompe l'oeil images.''
Another recent introduction is based on a traditional theme.
Pilkington's new Royal Lancastrian collection has been inspired by a
Victorian archive design from the original Royal Lancastrian pottery and
comes in floral and lace designs as well as an elegantly simple design.
These tiles have a high gloss finish and authentic theme colours so
that motifs, borders, frames, decor strips, friezes, and dados can be
easily combined.
The Victorians had a great passion for quarry tiles for flooring in
their homes. They were often set out in elaborate patterns on hall
floors to give a grand first impression when guests entered.
Quarry tiles were also a favourite theme in 19th century farmhouses,
not only because they created a warm and rustic look but, again, because
they were easy to clean.
Now as Hawkins, part of the giant Marley Group, is discovering, quarry
tiles are witnessing renewed interest today. One reason, of course, is
their variety and attractive finish. The Hawkins range currently sports
four colourways -- heather mixture, Staffordshire red, brown brindle,
and harvest mixture.
Possibly even more significant in their renewed popularity is the
first-class water-resistant qualities of quarry tiles.
As well as being used effectively for areas such as kitchen work
surfaces, exterior steps, patios, and porches, Hawkins is finding quarry
tiles becoming increasingly popular for conservatories. There is no
chance of water marking them. All that's required is a quick wipe with a
cloth.
There is, of course, another practical reason for the renewed interest
in this very traditional form of home decoration -- finance. As the
British Ceramic Tile Council explains, ceramic tiles offer good value
for money, and a worthwhile home investment for the future because
ceramic tiles last virtually forever.

IN the weekend when they will almost certainly clinch their seventh
championship in sucession, Rangers chairman David Murray yesterday
outlined plans which are intended to take the club towards the millenium
and the European league which he believes will be in place by then.
The Player Transfer Reserve Fund will be established as a one-off
boost, if season ticket holders are willing to invest a further #399 in
the club, designed to make sure that the premier division title remains
at Ibrox and the club's Champions' League displays improve.
It will mean that Rangers can spend #10m-12m this summer on four or
five new players, most of them foreigners, and give them the injection
that Murray insists is required as the club reaches what he calls the
''crossroads.'' It is a description which might alarm his Scottish
rivals, but the chairman explained his case this way.
''We have now to go through a major transition as a club. We are going
to spend another #4m on the stadium by August, following on the #33m
already spent on it, and a net #14m spent on players. We have to go to
our supporters to seek additional funds. Not all of them can afford that
and there will some who will be cynical about this, but no-one is being
forced into it and we would hope there will be those who wish to do
so.''
In fact, Rangers anticipate at least 11,000 interested parties among
their 35,000 season ticket holders, not to mention the 5000 or so new
ticket buyers who will be accommodated when the corners are filled in
this summer. That would raise #5m from the supporters, in return for
which they would get the right to buy their season tickets for the next
25 years, a family transferrable entitlement, a free weekend ticket for
the pre-season tournament, and other discounts.
They would also see the benefits on the field of the players their
money will help buy and no doubt would feel very much part of the 'Blue
Heaven,' as the club calls this initiative, in keepng with the stadium's
new look, when all the seats will be blue. The intention is also to
erect giant screens, which will be the biggest in the UK and will be
used when possible to screen away matches.
''While we are satisfied with what has been done in the seven years of
my stewardship,'' said Murray, ''we need to play in the Champions'
League on a regular basis. I could choose to sell part of the club to
raise finance, but I think the Rangers fans believe in what I am doing
and trust me.
''Clubs in this country are making progress, like Celtic and
Kilmarnock, and once the stadium costs are out of the way the prospects
I believe are good for Scottish football. It is my view that by the year
2000, five or six of our clubs will be playing in a European league,
with the matches in midweek.
''It may be divided in northern/ southern divisions or in some other
fashion, but I am certain it is coming.''
There is a chance that Rangers will be seeded for next season's
Champions' League, which would mean avoiding having to play in the
preliminary round, but Murray said: ''Hopefully, we will get up there
somehow, but there are lots of difficult permutations to be resolved.''
Murray indicated that the club knew who they wanted to buy to boost
the staff for the new season, but preferred to leave any more discussion
about that to manager Walter Smith.
Smith emphasised again that it is unlikely any new men would be
acquired before the end of the season and added that the transition
period would mean that he would spend the cash available on a few
players, rather than spend it all on the one big name.
''We need more than one player. Manchester United's sitution with Andy
Cole was different. We have cut our squad down, knowing that we have to
build it up again. That means we have to sign more than one player in
the close season.
''Maybe we will get to the point where, like Alex Ferguson, we feel we
need only one player to complete the squad, but that is certainly not
the case right now.''
Smith also suggested that, while it might be preferrable in light of
the UEFA restrictions on foreign players, he will be concentrating
abroad. ''There is not a big choice of quality Scottish players
available and we have to remember that, first and foremost, you've got
be successful on the domestic front.
''If you asked Rangers fans what they want, they would agree with the
European bit, but they would also go along with our aspirations to win
as many championships as we can, remembering Celtic's nine in a row. In
any case, you have to win the title to get into the European Cup and we
cannot afford to limit ourselves to Scottish players. We may need to
take a step back and have five or six foreign players on the staff.''
Meanwhile, Borssia Dortmund yesterday denied any interest in Rangers'
fringe international defender Basile Boli.
General manager Michael Mayer insisted: ''This is pure invention. We
have had talks with our Brazilian defender Julio Cesar, who has assured
us that he will fulfil his contract and stay another year here at
Dortmund.
''If for any reason that does not happen, then the player we would
want to replace him is Jurgen Kolher of Juventus.''

GERMAN players made an impact with vital goals in England's
Premiership matches yesterday.
Maurizio Gaudino and Uwe Rosler made their mark by combining to boost
Manchester City's hopes of avoiding the drop with victory over
Liverpool, while Tottenham's Jurgen Klinsmann struck a late leveller to
leave Crystal Palace in real danger in the relegation dogfight.
Gaudino headed a winner after 73 minutes from Rosler's cross as City
climbed no fewer than seven places to eleventh with a 2-1 defeat of
Liverpool at Maine Road -- only their third win in 20 League games.
Nicky Summerbee had given Brian Horton's men the lead lead in 18
minutes -- from a Gaudino centre -- only for Steve McManaman to level
within three minutes with a delicate chip.
Palace, whose dreams of reaching the FA Cup final evaporated amid
Wednesday's bad-tempered semi-final replay with Manchester United,
remained firmly entrenched in the relegation zone as a result of
Klinsmann's spectacular conversion of a disputed free kick in the 1-1
draw with Spurs.
The home defenders protested furiously when FIFA referee Philip Don
punished Gareth Southgate's challenge on Teddy Sheringham three minutes
from time.
Klinsmann stepped up to slam the free kick around the wall, past
stand-in goalkeeper Rhys Wilmot, and in off the crossbar for his
twenty-seventh goal of the season.
The German admitted his equaliser came by the kind permission of
Darren Anderton. He said: ''Darren normally takes the kicks but I went
up to him and asked if I could have a go. He was happy so I just struck
the ball and luckily it went in.
''I was a bit upset with myself because I had missed two or three
chances earlier.''
Klinsmann has been targeted by German giants Bayern Munich but will
make no decision on his future until the end of the season.
Chris Armstrong had put Palace ahead after 41 minutes, firing in low
from 25 yards after the ball broke to him when hard-working Iain Dowie
challenged Gary Mabbutt in the air.
The point boosted Spurs' hopes of qualifying for Europe, but
third-bottom Palace really needed all three.
Another foreign player, Daniel Amokachi, scored both goals in
relegation-threatened Everton's 2-0 home clash with Newcastle. It was
the Nigerian's fourth goal in two games.
Newcastle's Robert Lee was sent off after 78 minutes for a second
bookable offence.
Pat Nevin fired Tranmere into second place in the first-division title
battle with the decisive strike in their clash with promotion rivals
Bolton at Prenton Park.
The Scot's goal after 34 minutes was enough for John King's side to
leapfrog their opponents and move within one point of leaders
Middlesbrough, with both teams having five games left.
Bolton manager Bruce Rioch revealed afterwards that his side had been
subjected to a razor-blade threat in the build-up to the match.
Rioch said that envelopes containing three razor blades had been sent
to the club's ticket office this week in another incident that will
bring shame on a game that has been rocked by scandal this season.

FIRST DIVISION
PRIDE could be the spur for Hamilton today and produce a problem for
promotion-seeking Dundee. On the face of it Hamilton, who have done well
this season to be in mid-table and out of danger despite playing at
Firhill, have little to prove, but manager Iain Munro is quick to point
out that the Dens Park club are one of the few sides they have failed to
beat this season.
Continued Munro: ''Not only that, we have not scored against them. My
players have their pride and they are intent in rectifying that.''
Although defender Martin McIntosh will be missing, Dundee may have
difficulty collecting the points.
Dundee manager Jim Duffy has no doubt about the importance of the task
and remarked: ''After the disappointment of failing to win last week we
need all three points.'' The Dens Park side will be without the
suspended Gerry Britton, with either Jim Hamilton or Paul Tosh
deputising.
Scottish Cup finalists Airdrie also need full points from their visit
to leaders Raith Rovers. Manager Alex MacDonald talked yesterday of the
disappointment of being held to a draw in midweek by Clydebank and said:
''Basically, now we have to win at Kirkcaldy.''
Paul Jack, who was outstanding in their cup semi-final win, is
doubtful with a groin injury. Raith will be without Barry Wilson, who
injured an ankle in a midweek challenge match against his former club,
Ross County, but Raith are hopeful that both Jason Rowbothom and Ronnie
Coyle will be available.
Dutchman Iwo Den Biemen has an ankle injury and will miss out as
Dunfermline visit St Johnstone. The Fifers have other worries, for both
Greg Shaw and Alan Moore are doubtful.
At the other end of the table it will be a nervous afternoon for those
hoping to escape the drop. Ayr United's Simon Stainrod was under no
doubts about the way they will play against Clydebank. With Vinnie Moore
back, he says: ''It will be all-out attack.''
St Mirren and Stranraer face each other with Paisley manager Jimmy
Bone confident that his side, despite missing Martin Baker and Jamie
Fullarton, can come out on top. Stranraer manger Alex McAnespie admits
the importance of the 90 minutes and says: ''If Saints win the gap
becomes too great for us.''

SECOND AND THIRD DIVISIONS
THE same again, please, could very well be Alex Smith's exhortation to
his Clyde troops as they play host to second-place Morton in today's
vital second division promotion encounter.
Last week's home win over leaders Dumbarton was as satisfying to Smith
in the manner of victory as the outcome itself, but he probably is in a
minority when he insists that performances are just as important as
results. Given the high stakes, managers can be forgiven if they are
prepared to sacrifice the silky stuff. Most would settle in advance for
any kind of victory, even if it is achieved via a soft, last-minute
penalty which goes in off both posts.
The only regret for Smith about last week's victory must be that it
was watched by only 600 fans -- and not all with a home allegiance.
Broadwood has been well patronised since it opened and it would be
disappointing if substantial numbers of Bully Wee fans failed to cheer
on their team precisely when such encouragement is most needed.
Morton took a large support to Stenhousemuir recently and are bound to
be given strong vocal backing again. Unfortunately, they will not be
cheering on Marko Rajamaki as he is automatically suspended following a
needless red card for hand-ball last week against East Fife.
Today it is Dumbarton's turn to play host to the Fifers, whose
promotion hope is dead barring five straight wins plus an improbably
combination of friendly results from elsewhere. The Sons are likely to
march on today, but their tough test will come next week when they go to
Stenhousemuir. The Warriors will not be thinking about that fixture just
yet, they will have a hard enough afternoon at Dumfries.
Forfar can secure promotion if they beat Ross County at Dingwall --
and a third division title will also be assured if East Stirlingshire
fail to beat Queen's Park at Hampden.
Alloa lost at home to Montrose recently and must try to retrieve those
lost points when they meet again, this time in Angus. Nearby, Arbroath
have lost their momentum after a revival under John Brogan but should
return to winning ways against Albion Rovers.

WITH respect to the clubs and individual players aiming for personal
targets, it is hard to avoid the suspicion that the Highland League will
be simply going through the motions in the closing three weeks of the
season.
With Huntly clinching the championship last week, the chasing pack
have been left to admit that high end-of-season placings and personal
pride is all that is left to achieve.
Fragmented fixture cards, with some clubs finishing their season a
fortnight ago and others still with five games to play, also leads to
the general end of term feeling which has descended on North football.
At Huntly, the champions have even decided to give some of their more
experienced men a day off against Forres today. But they still want to
equal last season's league-winning gap of 18 points, achieve 100 league
goals for the season, and reach 100 goals in all competitions.
Nevertheless, manager Steve Paterson has told Doug Rougvie and Steve
Gray to take a deserved day off.
Brora Rangers manager Jim Kelly has key men Jim Gardiner, Iain
McDougall, Andy MacKay and Donald Allan out and Jocky MacKay doubtful,
but Kelly is determined to give the Brora fans a win in their last home
game of the season against Buckie Thistle.

AT first glance it seems to be a difficult quandary for Celtic: if
they fail to beat Aberdeen at Pittodrie they make Rangers premier
division champions by proxy, but if they beat the northern side they
leave one of their most cherished former players, Roy Aitken, in serious
danger of seeing his team relegated for the first time in their history.
It might appear to be one of those rare football moral dilemmas, but
Tommy Burns, Celtic manager and long-time friend of Aitken, sensibly
prefers to reduce it to the status of a match between two teams who want
to win.
''For Roy it must be absolute torture,'' he said. ''That said, it is
because of an accumulation of results over the season that Aberdeen are
in this position. Roy has had to come in at the toughest time.
''I can only be concerned with getting Celtic back on the rails and
for us the chance to chase a UEFA Cup place by finishing second in the
table is what matters most.''
His counterpart at Ibrox, Walter Smith, would acknowledge that as the
way any manager in the circumstances would behave. He will not be
looking towards Pittodrie for any help with the anticipated celebrations
after their game with Hibs at Ibrox tomorrow.
''We can look forward to the chance to clinching the title now in our
own right. Last season we clinched it in unusual circumstances, when we
lost, but I would like to think by 4.40 on Sunday we will be champions
after a decent performance of our own.''
He will be without defender Basile Boli and midfielder Stuart McCall,
but Craig Moore is available after suspension and Gordon Durie is fit to
play.
Hibs are likely to have to continue without injured captain Gordon
Hunter, but will not be turning up intending to be bit players in the
great scenario. Manager Alex Miller said: ''There will be a great
atmosphere at Ibrox and any player worth his salt will revel in it. Our
season is far from finished and it is an important match for us.''
Celtic feel the same about the visit to Aberdeen as they compete with
Motherwell and Hibs for second spot. They will probably be without Peter
Grant and Pierre van Hooydonk, and bring in Tony Mowbray and Charlie
Nicholas to the squad. ''We don't want to rely solely on the cup final
to get into Europe,'' said Burns, ''and, in any case, finishing second
would be an indication of improvement.''
Burns understands the situation his old team-mate now faces, because
he was at Kilmarnock last season when safety was only secured on the
last day. ''There were five or six teams involved right to the wire then
and it would not surprise me if it is the same this time.''
Meanwhile, Aitken has put aside re-signing talks with several players
until the relegation issue is resolved. Although the club has accepted
that defender Stephen Wright looks certain to leave in the summer when
his contract ends, talks with others, like Scott Booth, Brian Irvine,
Paul Kane and Michael Watt, will be put on hold.
One former Celt who has been doing his very best to help his team out
of trouble is Joe Miller and he will be trying just as hard against his
old mates, even if he is convinced they will win the cup next month.
'It has been very frustrating for me, because I have hit my best form
in years,'' he said. ''I've had a run in the first team and the
management believe in me, but I've got so little to show for it all.
This must change and I believe it will against Celtic.''
Aitken agreed: ''We have shown in the past that at our best we can
beat the best. Tomorrow is the ideal opportunity to show what we are all
about.''
Former Aberdeen stalwart Alex McLeish, now player-manager of
Motherwell, intends to return to the playing bit of the game against
Falkirk at Brockville as his team, who were looking good for second spot
a few weeks ago, now have a real contest on their hands. With Chris
McCart recovering from an operation and new boy Mitchel van der Gaag
injured, the manager has selected himself for the central defence area.
Falkirk, who are going along in tremendous style, could actually
finish up third top of the table if they win.
Kilmarnock have also virtually secured their place in the top division
for next season and will prove tough opponents for Dundee United, who
desperately need the points. United's new manager believes his side are
capable of winning all of their last five games but have to show the
grit and determination required.
United will be without suspended Maurice Malpas and injured Craig
Brewster, but Billy McKinlay and Andy McLaren are fit. They will be
anxious to hear if the great escape artists, Partick Thistle, have done
it again at Tynecastle, where Hearts cannot afford to slip any further
down the table.
Hearts look likely to be without defender Dave McPherson, carried off
in the defeat by Kilmarnock on Wednesday, the latest in a long line of
sidelined players, including Stephen Frail, John Robertson, Jim Bett,
Billy Hamilton and Kevin Thomas. Thistle will be without suspended Wayne
Foster, the former Hearts striker.

SCOTLAND'S Fraser Walker benefited from the controversial late
withdrawal of world champion and record-holder Jani Sievinen when he
picked up the bronze medal in the 200 metres medley at yesterday's World
Swim Challenge at the Commonwealth Pool.
The Fin, whose last defeat was in the 1992 Olympics, had given a hint
of what was to follow when he had earlier confessed that he did not
relish taking the chance of ending his unbeaten run by taking on World
championship bronze medallist Attila Czene.
Czene cruised to victory in a meet record of 2-02.89, over five
seconds ahead of runner-up Petteri Lehtinen (Finland). Walker's time was
2-11.59.
The sole British success came in the 100m back-stroke, Martin Harris
winning comfortably in 57.08sec. Forbes Dunlop brought the home medal
tally to two with a third place in 1-00.87.
Claudio Poll,from Costa Rica, the Olympic 200m free-style champion,
won the 400m free-style in a meet record of 4-14.48 and then went on to
take the 100m in 57.47. Scotland's Alison Sheppard, a late entry,
finished seventh in 58.99.

GLASGOW Tigers posted one of their all-time great performances to beat
Wolverhampton 52-44 in the Premier League at Shawfield last night.
Skipper David Walsh was top scorer for the home side with 14 points and
along with team-mate Mickie Powell he treated a big crowd to two of the
best races likely to be seen on any British track this year.
The Tigers pair were outstanding in heat 11 with a 5-1 over
highly-rated Wolves rider Peter Karlsson and Colin White, then turned on
a dramatic finale in the last race. Walsh led all the way from Karlsson,
but Powell stole the show with a sensational overtake of 1993 world
champion Sam Ermolenko to earn Glasgow a famous victory.
At Powderhall, Edinburgh Monarchs collected their first Premier League
three-pointer by beating Swindon Robins 54-42. Dane Robert Larsen made
an impressive debut for the home side, scoring 10, although he was
headed by team-mate and countryman Jan Anderssen on 12.
Monarchs raced to a 14-point lead after heat five, although Mark
Thorpe (16 points) and Craig Boyce (15) inspired a late Swindon revival.

WITH a 6-5 victory over England in their last round-robin game,
Scotland's men's team won their way into the semi-final stages of the
World championships in Brandon, Manitoba.
The Scottish team -- skip Gordon Muirhead, Peter Loudon, Bob Kelly and
Russell Keiller -- now face Germany, led by Andy Kapp, while the other
semi-final will be between unbeaten Canada and the USA, who fought their
way through two tie-breakers, against Switzerland and then Norway, to
claim fourth place overall and the last available semi-final slot.
The Scots opened well against England, scoring a 2 when skip Muirhead
split on his own stone at the front of the house.
The English skip, Alistair Burns, elected to blank the next three ends
as he looked for the chance to level the score, but had to settle for a
single at the fifth, when his last stone wrecked on a front guard.
England scored 2 at the sixth end to go ahead at 3-2, but Scotland
responded immediately with a 2 in the seventh. They stole a single to
stretch their lead to 5-3, but the English came back yet again with a 2
at the ninth to level.
In the tenth end, Muirhead completely missed with his first effort as
he attempted to take out an English stone, but Burns could not take
advantage, coming up too strong wih his own last stone to hit and roll
harmlessly through the house. The Scots were able to score a 1 for
victory and a semi-final place without Muirhead having to throw his last
stone.
This victory kept Scotland clear of a rankings pile-up behind them.
Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the USA played past midnight on
Thursday and again early yesterday morning to resolve who would claim
the fourth semi-final place. The USA finally came through, beating
Switzerland and then Norway.
In the women's semi-finals yesterday, Canada beat Germany by 10-4
after nine ends and now face Sweden, who won beat Norway 6-4. Germany
and Norway now meet today for bronze before the final.
The Scots, led by Kirsty Hay, just failed to qualify for the
semi-finals, tying in fifth place with Denmark, Switzerland, and the
USA. Results:
Men. Ninth round -- USA 3, Norway 5; Sweden 2, Canada 8; England 5,
Scotland 6; Wales 5, Switzerland 6; Australia 3, Germany 5.
Final standings: Canada won 9, lost 0; Germany 6-3; Scotland 6-3;
Norway 4-5; USA 4-5; Switzerland 4-5; Sweden 4-5; Australia 3-6; England
3-6; Wales 2-7. First tie-breaker: Switzerland 3, USA 6; Norway 5,
Sweden 4. Second tie-breaker: Norway 1, USA 10.
Semi-final line-up: Canada v USA; Germany v Scotland.
Women. Semi-finals -- Germany 4, Canada 10; Norway 4, Sweden 6.

SCOTLAND face Italy in the under-21 international at Bridgehaugh this
afternoon in more confident mood after breaking an eight-year sequence
without a win in their last match against Wales at Inverleith, where the
Scots achieved a 15-9 victory, writes Alan Lorimer.
But former Scotland captain David Leslie said of his young charges:
''They are under no illusion about how hard it will be to add to that
victory. The team actually played much better against Ireland than
against Wales.''
Leslie believes that in the Irish match (a 24-22 defeat) the Scots
were just not streetwise when they had the game won and allowed their
opponents to score in the final minute of play.
He knows little about the Italians' form, but expects them to be big
and quick on the break. Last year, in San Dona Di Piave, Italy won
33-30, and the previous year the Italians achieved a 29-18 victory at
Poynder Park.
Scotland Under-21 -- P Flockhart (Stewart's Melville FP); H Gilmour
(Heriot's FP), M McGrandles (Stirling County), C Murray (Hawick), C
Morley (Bath); D Hodge (Watsonians), A Featherstone (Morgan FP); M
McCluskie (Edinburgh Academicals), G Bulloch (West of Scotland) , B
Stewart (Edinburgh Academicals), I Elliot (Hawick), P Jennings
(Boroughmuir), S Grimes (Edinburgh University), T McVie (Edinburgh
Academicals), G Dall (Heriot's FP). Replacements -- R Brown (Melrose), B
Easson (Boroughmuir), M Rennie (Stewart's Melville FP), D Massey
(Currie), L Graham (Boroughmuir), D Cunningham (Boroughmuir), C Cottrill
(Langholm).

AS you prepare this happy Easter to munch your way through the
remnants of that sticky chocolate egg in a frenzy of happiness and
self-satisfaction, it might be worthwhile pausing and wondering if
everyone in the world is quite as happy as you are.
Take, for instance, the man whose masterful back-flip of a pass
released Gavin Hastings for that lung-bursting surge to the line that
snatched victory in Paris for the first time in 25 years. Gregor
Townsend, who also scored a try in that match, proved in a sunny Paris
that his precocious talent had truly arrived. Here was a star.
He was talked of as the linch-pin of the Scottish back division of the
future. Nought to 60 in five seconds seemed about right, and he had more
rugby about him than many a back in the world.
But, temporarily at least, that has all gone. All the glory that
should have been his on the biggest stage the world can give has been
snatched from him. Injury re-wrote his script. Townsend is out of the
World Cup, and he now has different targets, and after his university
exams are complete he will go out to Australia to play for his former
club there in the later stages of the Australian championships.
''Yes, if things go well then I will go and play for Warringah in
August and September,'' said Townsend. ''They will be in a cup run and
involved in play-offs, and their Grand Final is in the middle of
September, so I hope to be all right for that part of the year. I
enjoyed playing there before.'' Warringah had tried to get Townsend to
go across earlier.
After that, it looks increasingly likely that the young Townsend will
indeed join Iain McGeechan's men at Northampton to further both his
playing career and, almost as important, his personal ambitions to
capitalise on his degree.
''I think that I will go down south to play for Northampton,'' he
said, ''but the job thing is as important. I have always wanted to be
involved in business, and it looks as though I will be working in
corporate finance for a merchant bank. We have had a few presentations
at the university and that looks a cool subject.''
Therein may be a tip for any club in Scotland ambitious enough to try
to attract Townsend to stay. Pay him 50 grand in corporate finance and
he'll stay. Mind you, so would many others.
But what of the psychological effect of having to watch his team-mates
fly off to the World Cup in May of this year? One minimal advantage is
that he will now be able to sit his exams in June instead of September,
but that is hardly consolation for what happened.
''I got a whack in the tackle, and my knee extended back the way. I
never felt anything at the time, I didn't feel anything go,'' he said.
''I got it checked out, and everyone hoped that my posterior cruciate
was merely strained. But later on they had it examined again and we
found out that the ligament was torn completely. That was obviously very
disappointing.''
Now he has the hard battle of getting back to fitness with the
knowledge that in five weeks' time he really should be somewhere else.
''The knee isn't really wobbly, and it only hurts when I get another
bang on it. I suppose it's not too bad, but I was shocked when they told
me that it was torn. The good thing is that next week I can start
running in water, with the aqua-jogger, and at best I will be better in
three months' time.''
And at worst? ''At worst,'' he said, ''after two months they will find
out that I need an operation and that would mean that I would be out for
a year. That would not be good. It's really bad thinking that you could
miss a whole year.''
Like all rugby fans he will be glued to the set to see how the team
fares on the high veldt in their important pool matches against Cote
d'Ivoire, Tonga, and France, and without Townsend that crucial attribute
of unpredictability that had been so obvious in the Scotland back
division will be in somewhat shorter supply. No more dancing round
defenders, no more jinking in for tries, no more passing instructions
down the line. Instead, for him, there will be the separation of
distance and only the glimpse of what might have been down a cathode-ray
tube.
''When I think about it, watching them run out could be a bad thing. I
am not looking forward to that,'' he said.
I caught Townsend the morning after he had been involved in an
exceptionally late night out with the boys, and his voice was hoarse.
''Gregor,'' I said. ''Genuinely, how are you coping with what's
happened to you at such a young age?'' The line went quiet.
''Just,'' he said as his voice tailed off.
And no wonder. Told you there were people worse off than you are.

IMAGINE a newspaper without an editor, or journalists unfettered by
conventions or legal constraints against libel and defamation. The Press
Complaints Commission doesn't exist in this Utopian world and scribblers
can write anything they want, without observing any of the legal
niceties . . . and get away with it.
The Internet provides just such a forum for world-wide amateur (and
professional) communicators and there's no such things as Netiquette
when they're venting their spleen in a tirade of abuse directed at any
and all.
International corporations are frequently vilified on the Net and
companies have virtually no redress, unless they wish to enter into
dialogue on the cyberwaves, but even then there are no PR bods to
protect the corporate executive who puts his foot where his mouth should
be and traditional press relations tactics don't work.
Microsoft (known as Microsloth to the cybergliders) and its
''Windoze'' software has come in for some below-the-belt comments from
across the globe. One spoof story that appeared on the Net, purporting
to quote Bill Gates, reported that Microsoft was acquiring the Roman
Catholic Church.
''Through the Microsoft Network,'' the naughty, anonymous writer said,
''we will make the sacraments available on-line and revive the popular
pre-counter-reformation practice of selling indulgences. You can get
communion, confess your sins, receive absolution, even reduce your time
in purgatory, all without leaving your home.''
Mr Gates was amused. Not.

DEREK DOUGLAS in Bucharest
Scotland Under-19 41, Spain Under-19 7
The Flower of Scotland was blooming again in Bucharest yesterday as
the young Scots ressurected their Junior World Cup campaign with a
convincing win over Spain.
Scotland scored six tries, three of them from Ayr winger Geoff
Caldwell, to snuff out the Spanish threat, and the Scots will now
contest fifth place with Romania tomorrow.
To finish fifth at their first attempt from the 12 nations at the
elite end of the 24-team competition would be a more-than-creditable
effort.
The final will be contested by Argentina and France. The Pumas, who
defeated a lacklustre Scottish side 43-3 on Wednesday, came from behind
to beat South Africa 20-13 yesterday. In the other semi-final favourites
France were too strong for Italy.
Wales, the only other home nation in the competition, will play Russia
tomorrow for ninth place.
Yesterday, Scotland played intelligent and entertaining rugby to
defeat Spain. The Spaniards were by no means an easy touch, the Spanish
Under-18 side having accounted for Scotland Under-18 just a fortnight
ago.
Scott Murray was the pick of the Scotland side yesterday, the
Edinburgh Academical lock showing up well in the lineout and in the
loose. The strong-running Caldwell took his tries well and Graeme
Beveridge was a sparky scrum half. Chris Docherty and the captain, Iain
Sinclair, performed notably in the loose.
Caldwell had his first try after 13 minutes, the scoring pass coming
from Gavin Dalgleish, who also converted. Allan Bulloch, the youngest
member of the party, scored a fine individual try three minutes later.
The only Spanish try came late in the opening period, Marco Garcia
barging his way over the line and Aratz Gallastegui converting.
In the second half, Scotland began well with an Alistair McLean try,
converted by Dalgleish. Five minutes later Caldwell notched his second,
the result of an uncharacteristically Scottish rolling maul.
The winger was in the points again soon after, his hat trick resulting
from a Beveridge break, good close-quarter work by Docherty, Murray and
Hunter plus intelligent linkage by Scott Tomlinson. Dalgleish converted.
The Gala fly-half kicked a penalty on the hour mark and replacement
prop Matt Smith put the finishing touches to good lead-up work by
Dalgleish, Kennedy, and Tomlinson with a try which Dalgleish converted.
Manager David Sole, who, after the defeat by Argentina, had declared
that the Scots had been at times spineless, was generous in his praise
of yesterday's effort, saying: ''The boys showed tremendous character to
put the Argentinian game behind them and to produce the performance that
they did today.''
Coach Alastair Christie declared: ''To come back as they did today was
terrific. The boys showed bags of character. There are still things to
work on but this gives us something on which to work.''
Scotland Under-19 -- S Tomlinson (Selkirk); G Caldwell (Ayr), R
Kennedy (Stirling County), A Bulloch (Hutchesons' GS), A McLean
(Boroughmuir); G Dalgleish (Gala), G Beveridge (Peebles); G Talac
(Musselburgh), C Docherty (GHK), J Kelly (Harlequins), E Boyd
(Boroughmuir/Caithness), S Murray (Edinburgh Academicals), A Cadzow
(Boroughmuir/Caithness), S McNeill (Ross High), I Sinclair (GHK/Dundee
High). Replacements -- C Hunter (Currie) for Boyd (39m); M Smith
(Watsonians) for Talac (58m); S Jenkins (Kilmarnock) for Bulloch (70m).
Yesterday's results -- South Africa 13, Argentina 20; Italy 0, France
24; Scotland 41, Spain 7; Romania 28, Uruguay 8; Poland 6, Russia 15;
Portugal 8, Wales 28.

CATALONIA OPEN
SCOTLAND'S Gordon Brand Jr and Welshman Phillip Price shrugged off
back problems to mount strong challenges during the first round of the
windswept Catalonia Open in Girona, Spain, yesterday.
Price, returning to tournament play after a month out of action, was
joint leader with South African Retief Goosen on 67, five under par,
while Brand Jr was one shot back after a bogey-free 68.
David Gilford, joint twenty-fourth at his first US Masters in Augusta
last week, was also in contention on 69.
Though the weather was dry and sunny, the players were buffeted by a
wind growing stronger throughout the day which made good golf more
difficult than usual, but Price was unconcerned. ''I played dreadfully
in my last tournament in Portugal a month ago,'' he said.
''After four weeks off, things are looking a lot better. My back has
been a problem for the past six months and I'm having further treatment
this week, but I think the course here is fantastic.''
Price owed his score to a brilliant finish and, after having started
at the tenth, he was only level par for his first 11 holes. But then he
drove 255 yards over an out-of-bounds corner and sank a 15-foot putt for
an eagle 2 at the 384-yard third.
''You can knock quite a lot of yardage off if you go over the
out-of-bounds,'' explained Price, ''and there really isn't much risk if
you know you can carry it. Anyway, it certainly set me off because I
birdied the sixth, seventh and eighth as well to come home in 32.''
Brand is also having treatment to his back, which he aggravated on a
fishing trip near his home just outside Bristol last week. But he had
the most consistent round of the day with 14 pars and four birdies in
his 68.
Goosen, the recent winner of the South African Open who hopes to join
the US tour next year, had four birdies in his 67, but his shot of the
day came at the 577-yard thirteenth, where he holed out from 110-yards
with a wedge for an eagle 3.
Gilford, who says he is having no difficulty in adjusting to slower
greens after Augusta, had only one poor hole in his 69 with a
double-bogey at the second, his eleventh. He took three shots to reach a
greenside bunker, then splashed out and missed an eight-foot putt.
The best-placed home Scot was Glasgow's Adam Hunter, winner of last
month's Portuguese Open, who was on 70. Andrew Coltart was on 72, one
ahead of Dean Robertson, Mike Miller, and Sam Torrance.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
67 -- R Goosen (S Africa), P Price.
68 -- G Brand Jr, P Walton.
69 -- D Gilford, P Eales, F Tarnaud (France), P Simpson, S Cage, P
Mitchell.
70 -- J Sandelin (Sweden), R Claydon, J Guepy (France), J Arruti
(Spain), M Campbell (New Zealand), H Clark, A Hunter, N Briggs.
71 -- D Carter, M Davis, G Ryall, P Moloney (Australia).
Other scores included: 72 -- A Coltart. 73 -- D Robertson, M Miller, S
Torrance. 74 -- G Orr. 76 -- C Cassells. 81 -- B Marchbank. 82 -- S
McAllister, C Ronald.
* HOLDER Elaine Bruce, of Baberton, successfully negotiated the first
two rounds of the Midlothian Ladies Championship at Kingsknowe
yesterday. Results:
First round -- E Bruce (Baberton) beat E McCowan (Prestonfield), 3 and
2; L Kane (Merchants) beat E Jack (Prestonfield), 1 hole; P Silver
(Turnhouse) beat V Aitcheson (Murrayfield), 4 and 2; D Simpson

The baby boomers know where they were and what they were doing when
John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas. But the death of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt was the major traumatic event for a slightly older generation.
Marian Reid remembers the day with touching clarity
We could not eat great-granma's strong Germanic food so we buried it
in the garden so it wouldn't look too bad
I GREW up in the American Midwest during the Depression years and
World War II -- so those in my age group were rather a serious lot. When
our English teacher asked us to memorise a poem of our choice I picked
the solemn O Captain! My Captain! by Walt Whitman. It was his heartfelt
tribute to President Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated as the Civil
War drew to a close. Now it was wartime again and Franklin D Roosevelt
was president; we were at Lincoln Junior High and the poem appealed to
me.
In my home of La Crosse a Civil War cannon faced the Mississippi River
on the grass of Riverside Park. Up north in Winconsin we were
''climatically challenged'', as you might say today, by cold winters
when rivers froze over. Before bridges were built sleighs were used in
pioneer days for crossing the ice to three-day wedding celebrations.
My great-grandfathers came from Germany to farm, enticed by posters
that promised good land at a keen price. Grandpa was a harmonica-playing
youth on his father's farm when he wed the pretty young schoolmarm who
was bed-and-boarding there, but she found rural life hard so they moved
to town for an easier time of it. As a youngster I enjoyed family
reunions on those farms from which we all sprang, with country women in
short white socks heaping picnic tables with food -- potato salad, sweet
and sour pickles, cucumbers, cold meats, corn relish, chocolate cake,
cherry pies and gigantic bowls of raspberries.
This area of southwest Wisconsin was called the Coulee Region because
of the little steep-sided valleys nestling between the bluffs. These
coulees were tree-lined and tranquil with a dusty road running through
them. Some were narrow and possessed a feeling that they held deep
secrets. I used to bike out to Smith's Coulee, a place that had a
special air about it, a kind of spiritual journey.
La Crosse, capital of the Coulee Region, was far enough away from the
big cities to be out of their orbit and developed a character, identity
and self-reliance of its own. Nobody was rich or all that poor. I never
knew a man who didn't work for a living. The La Crosse Tribune, the
daily newspaper for our town of 42,707 people, faithfully recorded all
births, weddings and deaths free of charge and included a picture with
every obituary.
The Mississippi River ran like a theme through our lives. I visited it
as an old friend when I later came home on college vacations. It was one
of life's certainties, like the rotation of the seasons.
In summer we swam in the river, near the incongruously named Isle La
Plume where the sewage plant was located, but in spite of dire warnings
we never came to any harm. In winter we trekked across the frosty bridge
to ice-skate on a flood-lit lagoon scraped clean of snow, a magical
wonderland. Town playgrounds were also flooded for skating. Each had its
warming hut heated by a pot-bellied stove and as we entered, a unique
never-to-be-forgotten-or-found-again-elsewhere smell assaulted our
nostrils -- the clammy odour of steamy woollen clothing accompanied by
the soggy atmosphere of melting snow seeping into damp wooden
floorboards.
Every spring Tausche's Hardware Store hung an Indian blanket in the
window, a prize for guessing the time and date when the frozen
Mississippi would thaw. Lying in bed at night I could hear its voice as
it broke up, the ice floes crashing and grinding on their way south. In
summer the calliope steam organ would call from the paddle-wheel
steamboats tied up at the levee, advertising day trips with afternoon or
evening dancing to live music.
Parades as well as the river marked the passage of the seasons. In
autumn the return to school was heralded by monotonous Labour Day
parades of walking men. Then came a colourful parade of marching high
school bands in bright uniforms from the surrounding small towns in an
annual contest hosted by the local teachers' college. It also had a
lively homecoming parade that heraldd the arrival of autumn. Winter
descended with the appearance of Santa Claus and his following elves who
shivered their way down an already frozen Main Street. Finally the snow
ploughs took over the streets which were then paradeless until late
spring.
As spring turned to summer the Memorial Day Parade had the most impact
on us. All schoolchildren from age 11 upwards took part and it was a
proud moment when we assembled for the first time on the green beside
Erickson's Bakery. To the happy smell of fresh bread we were organised
into lines and each given an American flag to carry. Then we marched
down Main Street, past the Carnegie library, Washburn primary school and
along La Crosse Street to the cemetery gates, where the parade
disbanded.
Then I wandered through the peaceful, leafy graveyard and planted my
flag on great-grandma's grave. She had worn long skirts whatever the
flapper fashion, her hair in a bun and spoke with a gutteral accent, and
once gave a party for the children of the family. We could not eat the
Germanic food strongly laced with vinegar so the neighbour's girl who
was helping out made a hole in the garden and buried most of it so it
wouldn't look too bad, while Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life and The Blue
Danube played in the background.
When I was 12, pulling myself up to my full height of 5ft 3ins which I
never bettered, I stood up in the classroom to recite my chosen poem O
Captain! My Captain! Our English teacher, a tall, willowy lady given to
wearing floaty dresses, had achieved an assignment that would stay with
me for the rest of my days.
I did not perform Oh Captain! My Captain! for the entire school, my
only public appearance there was as a tap-dancing reindeer. But somehow
the poen became a talisman and bonded with me as no other poem has. I
find myself reciting it in sudden surges of patriotism or moments of
stress, as I did as a girl many years ago on a fateful spring day.
I was collecting rags door-to-door on my bike with the Girl Scouts for
the war effort -- the war was finally drawing to a close but we still
worked on -- when a woman came rushing out of her house.
''Have you heard, have you heard?'' she gasped in a voice mixing
excitement, awe and dread in equal parts.
Busy with our task we had heard nothing.
''He's dead, the President is dead,'' she told us. ''It's just been
announced on the radio.''
We are stunned. Bags of rags slung over our handlebars, we cling to
our bikes in disbelief. It is incomprehensible. He is the only president
we know, he had hauled us out of the Depression and led us during a
complicated war.
O Captain! My Captain! our fearful trip is done, the words well up
spontaneously -- another captain, this one of my own time, another
death, another war about to finish . . .
but I with mournful tread,
walk the deck my Captain lies,
fallen, cold and dead.

MICHELE Mair heads hopes of a Scottish success when the Reebok British
Tour comes to the new #3m Craiglockhart centre in Edinburgh next week.
The 23-year-old from Colinton, ranked 14 in Britain and 464 in the
world, is one of the leading entries for the women's singles which has
attracted 32 competitors including British No.5 Lucie Ahl, No.10 Karen
Cross, and Kaye Hand who was runner-up in last year's national
championships. Dundee teenager Jennifer Duncan, winner of a $5000
satellite tournament in Mexico last month, is also in the main draw.
Hand's brother Paul, current leader of the men's Tour points table and
winner of the 1993 Scottish grass court championships at Craiglockhart,
will be one of the main contenders for the #650 first prize but can
expect tough opposition from British No.8 Gary Henderson and No.16 Tom
Spinks.

I AM always reading lots of things all the time: magazines, books,
papers, periodicals. There are two books that I'm just finishing. The
first one is Daughter of Persia by Sattareh-Farman Farmaian, with the
journalist Donna Munker.
It's an autobiographical account of this woman who was born and
brought up in a harem as part of one of the leading families in Iran.
She's now in America, as she just escaped and no more with her life at
the time of the Khomeini revolution. It was my husband, Jim, who
recommended it. He works a great deal in the Middle East, and is
fascinated by the whole culture of Islam.
You just wouldn't believe what a wonderful book it is. It's simply
written, and the story is absolutely unbelievable. It does a whole lot
of things: it explains the history of Iran, why the Iranians at the time
of Khomeini were so opposed to America, and it explains life within the
harem. One of the threads running through the book is Sattareh-Farman
Farmaian's own analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the Iranian
character.
This woman is unbelievable. She went off herself to America during
wartime. She had never been without the veil or gone anywhere without a
servant. She had the flimsiest information as to how to get to
university, yet was the first Iranian woman to attend the University of
Southern California.
She became an adviser to the White House as translator, but wanted to
go into social work and so returned to establish the first school from
scratch in Tehran during the 1950s. I cannot believe this woman. She's
in her seventies, incredibly patrician-looking with a hooked nose and
finely chiselled features. An amazing book.
The other book is Terry McMillan's Waiting To Exhale, the story of the
development of black women in America and the relationship beween four
middle-class women, and, in particular, their relationships with men.
It's not Mills &amp; Boon. The women seem to be the strong ones, and a lot
of the men, for all sorts of socio-economic reasons, are just more
shiftless than the women. You don't like to draw generalisations like
that, but that's what the book does. If black women themselves are
willing to say black men are terrific in bed but nowhere else, then I'm
willing to believe them.
I read all the time. I have two books just waiting to be lifted: The
World's Religions and the Nelson Mandela biography. I've another two wee
books that I'd commend to anybody. They're the type you get in the
supermarket. One is New Words and Their Meanings by Jonathan Green, the
other is by Scottish writer Gordon Jarvie and is called The Bloomsbury
Grammar Guide.
It's a dictionary of grammar and is very, very easy to read. It's just
enjoyable; I'm not joking, it's absolutely terrific, I love it --
because, you see, I'm getting very, very angry at people who don't speak
proper (laughs). It's a real bugbear with me.
English may be the international language, but it's a distorted
language that's being spoken. If precision is lost, then understanding
is lost, and if understanding is lost then I think the development of
all sorts of relationships -- personal, community, international -- are
all under threat. I think language is so important.

THE POLISH OFFICER
Alan Furst
HarperCollins, #14.99
ALAN FURST'S last novel, Night Soldiers, was a deep and quite
magnificent work tracing the start of the cold war through events in
Europe in the thirties and during the Second World War. It was fiction
on the grand scale: ambitious, hyper-intelligent, beautifully written
and politically wise. After that, his next novel was almost inevitably
going to be an anti-climax. And so, sadly, it proves. Not that The
Polish Officer is anything other than good. But it lacks the remarkable
sweep of Night Soldiers, though many of the themes are the same.
The titular Polish officer is Alexander de Milja, who is in at the
formation of the Polish Underground as Warsaw is occupied by the Germans
in 1939. Furst records his adventures over the next two years in Poland,
Romania, France, and the Ukraine. The plot is episodic; indeed you could
characterise Furst's style as dark picaresque. The only thing holding
the whole together is the character of de Milja, and while he is
sensitively drawn, he is hardly a rounded personality. You sense that
Furst is perhaps less interested in him than he was in Khristo
Stonianev, the Bulgarian protagonist of Night Soldiers.
But this novel does have its share of wonderfully written set pieces,
and it begins and ends superbly. The beginning is about a perilous train
journey through occupied Poland, as the beleaguered nation's gold
reserves are smuggled out to the safety of Sighet in Romania; and the
final episode describes an epic truck journey, literally through the war
as well as through the frozen wastes around the River Bug, on the
Polish-Ukrainian border in 1941. Here Furst conveys with lucid authority
the ultimate hell of war, when all the forces -- German, Russian,
partisan -- moving through this landscape of hell, are evil. The forces
of good are tiny and tenuous, and you sense that the war cannot be won,
for the tyranny that is clearly coming is almost as grotesque as that
which it will replace.
In his own dark way, Furst is the laureate of the vast mysterious
tracts of Eastern Europe. His descriptions of landscape are
breathtaking, and his suggestion of the horrors of war is at once subtle
and brutal. In parts, this is an extraordinarily fine novel; but it
lacks the bleak grandeur of its predecessor.

SANDY Carmichael, the former Scotland and British Lions prop is to
coach Hutchesons'/Aloysians next season.
The club announced yesterday that Carmichael, who has been involved in
coaching the West of Scotland male and female rugby teams in recent
seasons, will join them in the summer.
The south side club finished bottom of Division 3 with just two points
after a season in which senior players defected to Clarkston.
HA secretary Gavin Summers said: ''We are absolutely delighted that
Sandy has decided to assist us next season. To say the least, the past
season has been disappointing, but this is a very positive step and we
hope it will be the way forward.''
Summers added: ''He saw enormous potential in the young squad and
feels he can help us move forward.''

THE advent of artificial grass surfaces was, according to
administrators, the beginning of the sport being played throughout the
year. Frost this winter in Scotland questioned that theory and now rain
in Rome has brought about postponement of the first day's play in the
women's Four Nations Tournament.
Yesterday's matches have been rescheduled for this morning with
Scotland beginning their programme as planned against Germany, the
Olympic silver medallists, before they go in against hosts Italy.
Play was, however, possible in Sardinia, where Edinburgh side Grange
were contesting the finals of the A Division of the men's European
Cup-winners' Cup in Cagliari.
Donald MacFarlane gave Grange an interval lead against Real Polo, of
Barcelona, converting a penalty. Polo, one of the fancied teams for a
medal, were shaken but they had the final say after the break.
They quickly drew level and then took the lead with a tremendous goal.
MacFarlane made claims for a penalty corner, but these were ignored and
the umpire awarded the Spaniards a free. It was quickly taken and they
found their centre forward with a brilliant overhead pass and he went on
to beat Paul Mellor, the Grange goalkeeper, who had a fine day despite
his side going down 3-1.
It was also a bad day for Heriot-Watt Universityin the women's
championship in Holland. They lost 5-0 to Russian club Tekstilshik.
* EUROPEAN Youth tournament results:

FROM 255 competitors who started the week alongside Steven Young,
Fifer Mark Donaldson is the only player left who can deny the
Fraserburgh 18-year-old a place in golf's record books today as the
third successive winner of the Mobil Scottish Boys' championship.
At two years Young's junior and three strokes inferior by handicap (+1
to 2), the 16-year-old from Kirkcaldy starts an obvious underdog, but
stranger things have happened.
Donaldson has shown great spirit throughout the entire week at Royal
Aberdeen and will not lack in courage in his attempt to turn back the
tide of emotion in his native north-east which has been sweeping Young
to victory all week.
The Fraserburgh Academy pupil had 15 relations cheering him on to a
double victory yesterday, a 5 and 3 quarter-final win over Spey Bay's
Rob Douglas, and a 3 and 2 semi-final success over Stewart Whiteford of
Lundin Links.
He admitted he expects around 100 supporters to travel from his native
Cairnbulg -- a village on the outskirts of Fraserburgh -- to watch
today's 36-hole battle unfold.
''That'll probably empty the place,'' said Young, tongue in cheek,
''but seriously, it's good to look around and see friendly faces in the
crowd. It doesn't make me nervous and I won't have any trouble sleeping
tonight, I can sleep anywhere. In fact, I could probably sleep on the
floor right now.''
That is ironic in a way, because if anyone could do with a nap on the
eve of the contest it should be Donaldson, who has had to play 117 holes
to reach the final, compared to Young's 100.
Another galling statistic for the Fife teenager -- who was 16 only a
fortnight ago -- is that Young is 12 under par for those 100 holes and
21 under par for the front nine alone.
''I'm excited about being in the final, but I know I'll have to play
at my best and not make any mistakes to win,'' said Donaldson, adding
with a smile and a glance at his listening opponent, ''but perhaps the
best chance I have of winning is to shoot him before we tee off.''
The Balwearie High School pupil will start with one advantage over
Young, however. He has a better knowledge of the eighteenth at Royal
Aberdeen.
The defending champion has never been taken to the final green this
week, while Donaldson passed it on his way to a nineteenth-hole
quarter-final success over Martin Brown of Monifieth yesterday morning
and almost visited it in the afternoon, before closing out his
semi-final opponent, Neil Steven of St Andrews, 2 and 1. Results:
QUARTER-FINALS
S Young (Inverallochy) beat R Douglas (Spey Bay), 5 and 3; S Whiteford
(Lundin) beat C Kelly (Cawder), 4 and 3; M Donaldson (Kirkcaldy) beat M
Brown (Monifieth), at 19th; N Steven (St Andrews) beat F Hutchison
(Dunfermline), 2 and 1.
SEMI-FINALS
Young beat Whiteford, 3 and 2; Donaldson beat Steven, 2 and 1.
Final (36 holes, 8.30 and 1.0) -- Young v Donaldson.
* EAST Kilbride's Craig Heap has a first-round tie against local
internationalist Diego Dupin in the first round of the French Junior
Nations Cup today after his second round 76 qualified for the latter
stages in tenth position.
Ralston's Alastair Forsyth, who shot 81 for 161, missed the cut by one
shot.

HERITAGE CLASSIC
NICK Faldo shot the low round of the day here at Hilton Head Island,
South Carolina, a 64 that bettered his opening round by 10 strokes. He
made seven birdies yesterday, three over them from putts inside three
feet, and the other four from putts of 15 to 20 feet.
Faldo said: ''Last night I did some bunker work to help my rhythm and
tempo. I've been too analytical in my putting, and I'm just trying to be
a bit more spontaneous now. I'm back in the tournament now. I'm just two
strokes back of second place.''
Meanwhile, Tom Lehman, who found his game last year, finishing second
to Jose Maria Olazabal at the Masters and winning the Memorial, shot a
six-under-par 65 at Harbour Town yesterday to take the second-round
lead.
Though the wind died down in the afternoon, no-one finished closer
than four strokes to Lehman's 10-under-par aggregate.
Lehman's new prominence afforded him many lucrative off-season
opportunities. Although he feels he did not over-exploit all the offers,
he found himself weary and not entirely ready to play in January.
''For the first time I feel the effect of playing in the off-season
and having it affect the regular season. I hit a wall on the West Coast,
and I'm still kind of tired. That's why this week is such a good one for
me. It's really a vacation week because you're on the beach. After this
I'm going to play with my kids on the beach, fly kites, and ride bikes.
It's very relaxing to be here,'' he said.
Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
132 -- T Lehman 67, 65.
136 -- J Daly 68, 68; J Parnevik (Sweden) 70, 66; P Stewart 70, 66; B

PLAY your cards right and zero dividend Preference shares, or zeros as
they are affectionately known, are that dream investment which can offer
a safe, tax-free return of nearly 9% a year. The trouble is you have
probably never come across them unless you are an expert on investment
trusts or your financial adviser has studied their merits.
Zeros are in the news because at a time when the world's stock markets
don't know where they are going, safe investments such as these come
into their own. Over the last year they have out-performed all other
investment trust sectors. According to figures produced by Micropal,
they rose on average by 5.65% in the year to April compared with a rise
of just 1.7% in the Footsie.
But what are zeros and how do you find out about them? They are issued
by a number of specialist investment trusts, have a fixed life and pay
no income. Instead, investors get a pre-determined amount when the trust
is wound up. The return is not guaranteed because the trust must have
enough assets to repay the shareholders. However, it is possible to find
zeros which carry very little risk, either because they have many years
to run or because the trust already has sufficient assets.
Although zeros are not entirely risk free, they work rather like
National Savings certificates. The best place to find out about them is
to ask the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) for its
factsheet and a copy of its monthly information bulletin. These give
details of 37 zeros currently available.
There is a wide choice of repayment dates -- and a big variation in
risk. This is reflected in the returns which range from 7.6% to more
than 12%, with the biggest risk attached to those offering the highest
return. Return is the difference between today's share price and the
price at which they are expected to be repaid expressed as an annual
rate of interest. Take Scottish National, the biggest issue. The zeros
cost around 242p and they will be repaid at 325p at end-September 1998,
which is equivalent to an annual return of 8.8%.
But how safe is that? Scottish National's assets are already
sufficient to repay the zero dividend shareholders 1.3 times. This can
also be expressed as something called a ''hurdle rate''. This shows by
how much the trust's assets must grow or can fall before the zero
repayment can be made or becomes at risk. Scottish National's hurdle
rate is minus 5.9%, which means its assets can fall by 5.9% a year
before the repayment is at risk.
Zeros can save you tax too. There is no income tax to pay although you
may have to pay capital gains tax when you sell. However, if you don't
normally pay this you can take advantage of the annual tax-free
allowance of #6000 for an individual or #12,000 for a married couple who
hold investments jointly. If you take profits up to this limit your
investment will be entirely tax free.
This is particularly attractive to higher-rate taxpayers who have
investments they want to shield from income tax. Zeros are also very
useful for medium-term financial planning. Their most obvious use is for
paying school or college fees. A lump sum can be divided between a
number of zeros which mature in different years. An alternative is to
buy just a couple of ultra safe ones and sell some of the holding when
necessary.
People heading for retirement, who don't want income but need to avoid
paying higher-rate tax on their investments while they are still
working, should also consider zeros.
There are costs associated with buying and selling them but these can
be quite modest. Many are available through savings schemes run by
investment trust management companies. Depending on the company, the
minimum investment is between #250 and #1000, and the commission varies
from nothing to 1%.
The AITC's factsheet and monthly information bulletin, which includes
details of the savings schemes, are available from Durrant House, 8-13
Chiswell Street, London EC1Y 4YY; tel: 0171 588 5347.

A HELL OF A WAR
Douglas Fairbanks Jr
Robson Books, #16.95
HOLLYWOOD has its own royalty. Douglas Fairbanks Jr, a true prince of
the blood, could have opted for the life of a celluloid warrior in the
Second World War, all morale-raising tours selling war bonds in a
specially-cut uniform. Instead, he enlisted in the American navy before
hostilties broke out and had what he calls ''a hell of a war''.
He ended it having been awarded the Croix de Guerre, the Distinguished
Service Cross, and several American decorations. He served on the
Murmansk to Archangel convoys, in North Africa, and in the Allied
landings in Italy and the south of France.
This is a fascinating account of wartime life as both warrior and
celebrity -- Fairbanks knew everyone who was anybody, from Larry and
Vivien, Noel and Gertie, David Niven, the Kents, to Dickie and Edwina.
He was close enough to the royals to be the only non-official American
at the Duke's funeral.
Fairbanks served in the Combined Operations Staff at Mountbatten's
request, and George VI, touring Fairbanks's ship at Scapa Flow, left the
crew dumbfounded when he remarked that the last time they had met was on
Sunningdale golf course.
Fairbanks tells a good story. Will Fyfe, his co-star in Rulers of the
Sea, turned out at his request to entertain the shipbound crew of the
aircraft carrier, USS Wasp, berthed on Clydeside, with a three-hour
session of jokes and songs without musical accompaniment.
Best of all, back in Hollywood making Sinbad the Sailor, he went to a
party with his wife, Mary Lee. Across the room was his first wife, Joan
Crawford. He had not seen her in years. How would Penelope welcome
Odysseus back from the wars? ''Good, you're back safe and sound''
perhaps? Hardly. Joan was made of different stuff. It is too good to
spoil, and provides a hilarious climax to a sobering and unusual memoir.

IF you send your child to private school, meeting the fees is likely
to be a huge drain on your resources. Perhaps that is why so many people
seek financial planning advice on covering the cost. Unfortunately,
there is no single solution and, as in so many areas of financial
planning, the answer lies in careful analysis of the resources available
and the options for investing them efficiently.
How should you go about analysing the problem and drawing up a plan
for action? Start by defining the target. You need some idea of how much
the fees will be, so even if it will be some time before your child
starts school, make contact with those you are interested in and find
out the costs. These will, of course, be expressed in today's terms and
it is worth remembering that fees have tended to rise rather more than
inflation over the years. This means you will probably need to place
your resources in investments giving a real return of more than
inflation.
The second element in defining the target is knowing how long it will
be before you have to start paying. Generally, the longer you have the
better. There are more investment opportunities suitable if you have
five or 10 years grace than if your need is immediate. You also have to
calculate for how long you must provide fees at the level established.
For example, secondary fees are higher, and you may have to consider at
what age your child will transfer to a more expensive school.
Armed with this information it is now time to examine your resources.
If you are fortunate you will have a lump sum available that can be
invested. However, most parents are not in that position and have to use
savings from income. The two are not mutually exclusive though, and a
combination of capital and savings can be equally effective.
Now you can look at the investment options. First, it is worth
considering what the investment attributes should be. Most people would
put security top of their list. You want to be sure the money you set
aside will be there when you need it, so high risk is out. Risk can come
from inflation as well, so the investment you choose should take this
into account.
Flexibility is also important. Not everyone can pre-select the school
their child will attend. Your occupation may dictate that you have to
move, upsetting your plans. Also, your child may have different needs to
those originally anticipated. Gifted children or those with learning
difficulties large or small are not always identified when they are
infants. Moreover, there is always the possibility, however unpalatable,
of death or injury to the child.
In today's climate you have to consider, too, whether the school will
still exist when your child is ready to attend, and it is important to
make sure of its financial viability before parting with any money.
Finally, the political climate can change, as can your personal
circumstances and views before education commences. So any investment
that cannot be rechannelled if such changes do occur should be avoided.
Before making a decision on investment, if you know for certain what
school your child will attend, find out what financial options it
offers. Many operate what are known as ''composition fee'' arrangements.
The school usually has its own charitable trust enabling it to take
advantage of tax exemptions to boost its income, and it will have
arrangements in place with a life assurance company to buy a deferred
annuity on your child's life.
The problem with this type of arrangement is that it does not meet
everyone's requirements for flexibility, and you should explore
carefully what the possibilities are if circumstances change after you
enter such a scheme. Those based on charitable trusts but not linked to
specific schools are also available if you have not yet selected a
school.
When tax relief was available on life policies, endowment assurance
was a common investment used to meet school fees. There was a good match
between the requirements of fees and the investment itself, and today,
even though tax relief is no longer available on premiums paid,
endowment assurance can still be useful.
For the proceeds of an endowment to be free of tax the policy must be
taken out for a minimum of 10 years. Premiums can be paid monthly or
annually. A series of policies maturing at different intervals can
provide the capital required. One of the features of with-profits
policies is that fluctuations in the underlying investment performance
are smoothed out over the life of the policy, cutting down the
investment risk. And the element of life insurance that can be built
into the policy safeguards the funds to meet the fees, even if the
parent on whose life the policy is written does not survive.
Other suitable investments to meet school fees are those that provide
both a fixed return at the required time and take advantage of tax
reliefs where available. National Savings certificates, both
indexed-linked and fixed-rate, are such a vehicle with a five-year life,
a tax-free return and the opportunity to encash them earlier if
required.
Unfortunately, the recent abolition of the Yearly Plan has made it
administratively more cumbersome to use National Savings by saving
monthly, but regular acquisition of certificates can achieve the same
result.
Personal equity plans which can be structured as savings schemes are
another useful vehicle, and it is likely the new style plans which will
be available shortly and which are linked to bonds will give a lower
risk return, although it must always be remembered that such investment
can fall as well as rise.
The PEP shelter means you can encash the plan when required without
worrying about tax on the proceeds, while the income tax exemption
offers the prospect of the fund growing faster than personally held
investments which may attract income tax at higher rates.
If you plan to use equities you hold personally as part of school fee
funding, remember that both husband and wife have a capital gains tax
exemption of #6000 a year, so by spreading the portfolio between you
both you can be tax effective. Although the volatility of equities, and
the fact they cannot be guaranteed to produce the required return just
when you want it, makes them less suitable generally for school fees,
you should not rule this route out.
Aside from the obvious flexibility, a stockbroker can help you pick
suitable investments that will give you a fixed return. Split capital
investment trusts are one source that can be used, and Government
fixed-interest securities can also be employed to ensure a good safe
tax-effective return.
Your Tessa can also be used to accumulate funds for school fees, but
remember that if you withdraw capital in under five years you will lose
the tax exemption on the interest paid.
So while there is no magic solution to school fee planning, earmarking
the right investments can make a big difference to the overall impact on
your finances.

MIND Games looks like starting favourite and finishing first in
Haydock's Field Marshal Stakes. Last season he beat three of the four
rivals he meets today and completed a hat trick of early wins at Royal
Ascot.
Jack Berry has got his stable off to a flying start and is
enthusiastic about the recent racecourse gallop of his rising star.
Millstream is a real danger, as she was less than a length behind when
they last met and showed improvement next time out, but Mark Johnston's
stable has so far been below par this season.
Dato Star completed a hat trick of prizes in National Hunt bumpers at
the Cheltenham Festival with a victory over the respected Red Blazer.
His superior fitness should give him the edge in the opening race over
the top stayers, including Further Flight, who now needs a couple of
runs before coming to hand.
Benzoe was a big disappointment last season to his connections, and to
his backers who sent him off favourite for the Ayr Silver Cup. He gets
his first run since switching to Lynda Ramsden's yard in the Family Day
Handicap and is less likely to lose energy giving trouble at the start
as she has gelded him. It may be worth an each-way bet that the changes
bring back his three-year-old form.
At Kempton, Hiwaya may offer a value bet in the Masaka Stakes. She won
at Ayr first time out last season and went on to win twice on this
course. The form of her victory in a Listed race at Newmarket looks
promising, as runner-up Germane went on to beat Subya in a Group 3 race,
and the winning margin over third-placed Poppy Carew was a length
further than Mamlakah or Spout recorded when they beat her at Doncaster.
Go Hever Golf has not lost since being gelded and shaped better than
ever on his reappearance. He can go in again on his return to the turf
in the Queen Elizabeth Handicap.
Stiletto Blade showed the greatest promise as a two-year-old of any of
the entries for the Easter Stakes, but Ian Balding reports that he has
not trained on over the winter. Given that question mark, it may pay to
oppose him with Missel, who ran the smart Sri Pekan to within a neck at
Royal Ascot.

STRAVAIGIN, from the Scots and old Norse, means to wander aimlessly.
If you are wandering around Hillhead and find yourself in Gibson Street,
the fates have indeed been kind.
At number 30, Stravaigin Cafe/Bar and Restaurant is the sort of
stopping point of which dreams and drams are made. Good food, an
eclectic menu, reasonable prices and value for money wines, plus real
ale and excellent espresso coffee all add up to an enterprising
establishment which deserves to be better known.
The upstairs bar, with its intimate balcony, serves Caledonian 80/-
and Deuchar's IPA at #1.60 per pint along with draught Guinness,
Carlsberg lager and cask-conditioned Addlestone cider. Their fish and
chips is done in a beer batter, while pints of prawns in their appealing
carapaces come with mayonnaise, lemon and bread and the Sunday Brunch
Glasgow Pizza is a full breakfast wrapped in a designer tattie scone
complete with cheese and tomato topping.
Torres Sangre de Toro Reserva, 1989, is a full fruity Spanish red for
#8.00 a bottle, Etchart Cafayate Torrontes, 1993, is a fragrantly dry
Argentinian white for only 50p more.
The downstairs restaurant with its George Wylie bannister,
Cocteauesque candelabra, Diego Rivera peasant pitcher and upright piano
is a subterranean lair of international delights.
This week's table d'hote three course, or two courses and tea or
coffee menu for #4.90, Chicken Tandoori, Penne Arrabiata and baked
Arctic Char were the featured mains, served from 12pm until 7pm Monday
to Thursday and 12pm until 5pm on Friday.
Among the specials on the a la carte were roast duck with chilli and
orange, chicken in Mexican chocolate sauce and a fish coriander lime and
garlic stew. A completely new menu takes over from Sunday.
April 27 promises to be a Stravaigin night to remember. Rising chef
Colin Clydesdale and his brigade are preparing a five-course Mexican
Banquet for #15 as part of the Scottish Food Proms programme. Phone
manager Carol Wright on 0141 334 2665 to reserve a place.
On Monday evening I was able to sample dips with blue corn Tortilla
chips, a Guatemalan seafood salad and home-made ravioli stuffed with
chicken, ham, onion and red pepper in watercress sauce. With a Lebanese
Cabernet Sauvignon Chateau Musar, 1988, #12.25, it left me feeling that
the restaurant scene in Glasgow is in safe hands.

HOT Scot Stephen Hendry gave Crucible rookie Stefan Mazrocis a severe
lesson as he began the defence of his world title in brilliant fashion.
The 26-year-old world champion defeated Mazrocis 10-3, having led 8-1
after the opening session of their first-round clash in Sheffield.
Although the underdog held up the Scot by taking two frames in last
evening's session, Hendry finished in style, compiling a break of 114 to
go with the 90 and 128 with which he started the match.
Mazrocis soon discovered it was to be a long bad Friday. Hendry carved
out a 90 break to begin his defence and a 128 clearance constituted the
283rd century break of his 10-year professional career.
Hendry had a break of 69 in the fourth frame and 27-year-old Mazrocis
was still facing a whitewash until he broke his duck in frame seven, and
the audience reserved their biggest cheer of the morning for his break
of 74. He looked set to claim the next but left an easy final red when
escaping from a snooker and Hendry cleared with 32 to take it on the
black.
The world No.1 then produced breaks of 39 and 45 to conclude the first
session, and victory was clinched by the evening-session interval.
An 8-1 lead was to prove popular, with Peter Ebdon and Hendry's
expected second-round opponent Tony Drago also taking seven-frame leads
into today's play.
World No.10 Ebdon, who was put on antibiotics after a recent bout of
bronchitis, replied with eight frames in a row after having dropped the
first frame to Liverpudlian Rod Lawler, the world No.45.
Last month's Irish Masters champion levelled at 1-1 with a break of
107. He managed a half-century in frame three but mostly it was a series
of modest visits to the table.
Drago, holder of three speed records -- fastest frame (three minutes),
best-of-nine win (34 minutes), and best-of-17 win (81 minutes) -- could
reach another landmark this morning. The 29-year-old Maltese world No.16
showed no mercy to Leeds-based Paul Cavney, ranked No.163, and raced to
8-1 in just 112 minutes.
If he quickly adds the two frames he needs, he will establish a new
best for the fastest win in a best-of-19-frames.
Drago was on course for only the second whitewash at Sheffield at 8-0
up but Cavney, who had to win five qualifying matches at Blackpool,
clinched the last frame of the session 88-2 to spare his blushes.
Thailand's James Wattana, who always tends to play in fits and starts,
looks like having a rare old battle with the determined Gary Wilkinson.
The Englishman took the opening frame, the ''Thaiphoon'' blew him away
in the next four, but Wilkinson then reeled off the last four of the
session for a 5-4 lead. Result and positions:
S Hendry (Scotland) beat S Mazrocis (England) 10-3. Frame scores
(Hendry first) 91-35, 136 (128)-4, 67-45, 99-1, 76-22, 71-9, 0-92,

EASTER lambs may be attractive in the fields, as one of the signs of
spring, but as a meat dish it is also attractive on the plate. One of
the flocks in Scotland dedicated to getting spring lamb on the Easter
menu is based at Oatridge Agricultural College in West Lothian. A flock
of 150 hybrid ewes is managed for January lambing.
Their first batch of spring lambs -- 18 of them -- went of to the
slaughterhouse at Bathgate on March 24 this year, followed by another
batch of 28 six days later.
Head of Agriculture, David Turner, is the man in charge of the sheep
unit, which sees its early lambing flock as one of the leaders in the UK
for lamb production, quality and earning power. ''We are very proud of
what we have achieved here over the years,'' he said. He himself has
been involved for the past 25 years.
The college's early lambing flock uses Suffolk cross Friesland/Cheviot
ewes with a Suffolk sire. This year, from 149 ewes they achieved a 94%
conception rate and 241 live lambs -- a lambing percentage of 173.4
which is regarded as very good from an August mating.
The ewes are coaxed into season early with the use of a hormone
implant -- a pellet placed behind the ear and then absorbed into the
bloodstream -- which prompts the reproductive system into believing that
the autumn breeding season has arrived.
This allows for lambing at the beginning of January and a crop ready
for the market from the end of March onwards. At Oatridge the lambing is
carried out under cover in sheds where the ewes will spend up to five
months of their year.
''It is a high input system, so we are always seeking a good price for
our lambs,'' said Mr Turner. ''We have to look for a minimum of #3 a
kilo gross weight.''
In addition to the early lambing flock the sheep unit runs 240 Mule
and Texel cross Mule lowland ewes and 200 Scottish blackfaced ewes.
The entire farming operation at the college is a teaching tool as well
as a source of commercial income. ''What we have to achieve ,first and
foremost, is high standards of stockmanship,'' said Mr Turner. ''For our
early lambs we want to use feed efficiently and get a good carcase
weight at the youngest possible age.'' They are weaned on to a high
quality intensive lamb concentrate.The ewes are fed on high quality
silage -- ''as good as goes to the dairy cows.''
Oatridge is proud of its lambs, and of all its operations. Its new pig
unit, created at a cost of #390,000, will be the centre of excellence
for teaching in that sector. Horses are currently a major feature and
the college is approved by the British Horse Society and the Association
of British Riding Shools as an examination centre.
* With the lambing season in full swing visitors to the countryside
are reminded to keep their dogs under control -- and don't pick up lambs
you might think are lost.
One area that will be visited by thousands of people this weekend is
Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park which covers more than 100 square miles of
Renfrewshire and Ayrshire.
Manager Chris Gledhill said: ''At this time of year farmers work 18
hours a day during lambing and visitors to rural areas must take care
not to disturb or scare sheep. Sudden fright can have fatal consequences
with sheep stampeded into rivers, marshes, ditches and quarries.''
He reminds visitors that farmers are legally entitled to shoot dogs
which are terrorising livetsock and dog owners themselves are liable to
be heavily fined for not controlling their pets.
He added: ''Please don't pick up lambs which may be lying in the
fields thinking that they are lost. The mother will be feeding out of
sight and if well-meaning people handle a new-born lamb it can destroy
the bonding link betwen ewe and lamb with disatrous implications.''

ON the face of it we were well prepared for rolling settlement of
share deals. The Stock Exchange said ''roll'' back in July and we all
rolled into the new 10-day settlement system. Well, most of us did.
The Exchange, which has been monitoring how the new system is working
month by month, says there have been gradual improvements, and the
latest figures show that more than 88% of bargains were settled on the
T-Plus-Ten deadline.
In case you have forgotten -- although investors were kept pretty well
informed about the switch from the old two or three-week account trading
period to the new tighter timetable -- T-Plus-Ten means you deliver
share certificates or cash 10 days after you dealt. Interestingly, most
of those who did not settle on the tenth day did so earlier -- on day
two or five. Only a small number took advantage of the facility to
settle later.
A pleased official remarks: ''On the whole it has gone very well. The
general feeling is that no-one noticed the change. It was fairly
seamless.'' Some investors put their shares into brokers' nominee
accounts to let them do the paperwork but a lot did not. One firm which
tried to insist on it quickly withdrew its ultimatum.
Later this year, however, new pressures will begin to mount. Rolling
settlement will be dramatically tightened to five days quite soon. June
26 is the date pencilled in, although not yet formally confirmed.
That is close enough to start thinking about making preparations if
you want to change the way you hold your investments. But you still do
not have to panic. Justin Urquhart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers
says: ''You will still be able to settle later than day five if you have
made prior arrangement with your broker.''
He predicts: ''Anyone who still retains their share certificates,
which is most people, will continue to transact their business on 10-day
settlement.'' Many observers agree that for people who keep their own
certificates, it will be physically impossible for all the deliveries of
shares and payments to be made within five working days.
It seems likely there will be in effect a two-tier system, with
five-day settlement where people have their shares in nominee accounts
or PEPs, and a 10-day period for those who certificate under their own
control. For the time being at least the market makers are expected to
allow this. ''I have not yet come across one who will not,'' says Mr
Urquhart Stewart. ''Some will allow 20 days.''
Inevitably, however, it seems there will be a progressive tightening
up. Once the Crest system for paperless transfer comes in -- probably
next year -- the number of market makers willing to deal for 10-day
settlement or longer is likely to decrease or involve a charge
equivalent to an interest payment.
The tightening up will encourage more people to shift into nominees or
PEPs. But Mr Urquhart Stewart points out: ''I do not think that simply
to meet the settlement timetable is the right reason to move. People
should look at the quality of service. There is no such thing as a free
nominee. You have to pay somehow. If the broker does not charge the
client, he must charge himself and run the nominee service at a loss.''
He maintains there is ''no rush'' to join a nominee. People should
talk to the brokers and find out what they need to do to deliver on a
timely basis. It will, he feels, be ''highly unlikely'' that they get
penalised. His advice is: to shop around to find out what services
brokers are offering and what they are charging. ''There are over 200 to
choose from, and you can easily find the facts,'' he says.
If you are a very active investor, always leaping in and out of
shares, the nominee service may be worthwhile. But for those who deal
only occasionally, the service may not really be a necessary expense
unless or until the system gets so paperless that company registrars try
to charge for issuing share certificates.
It is worthwhile thinking and choosing carefully before going into
either a nominee or a PEP. Once your securities are in a broker's
nominee you will not easily be able to deal through another broker. So
it seems a good idea to go round a few with a shopping list of
questions.
Some are fairly obvious but others are old bones of contention. Since
you are likely to be effectively locked into the broker, you had better
know all about his or her dealing charges, particularly the minimum
which could be pretty high, maybe as much as #40, which would take a
nasty bite out of most privatisation minimum holdings. Then there are
entry charges to set up the system and ongoing charges, maybe a
percentage of annual valuation plus a dividend collection charge. Some
only charge for dividend collection. You also need to know if there is
an exit charge which might be levied if you wanted to cash in or switch
to another firm.
But do not forget also that if you disappear into a nominee you will
not appear on the company register in your own name. So it is worth
asking how you would get the perks if the company gives them, and if you
can get an annual report without being charged. Most brokers running
PEPs send an annual valuation, but would you get this with a nominee
service and would you be charged for it?
Think too about the method of dealing you want to use. There are
different levels of service and charges ranging from postal, slow but
cheap, to telephone. Mr Urquhart Stewart adds a tip when you discuss the
telephone dealing charge and service: ''Find out if your order will be
dealt with immediately or passed on to be done later. We deal
immediately but not everyone does.''

In the light of a new report funded by the Equal Opportunities
Commission Mark Morpurgo assesses the Government's plan to raise women's
state retirement age to 65.
TO adapt a saying, all men are equal, but some are more equal than
others, particularly when some of the men are women. Most people are
aware the Government intends to raise women's state retirement age to
65, and to many this has seemed logical and fair.
However, research by York University (funded by the Equal
Opportunities Commission) has queried the Government's assumptions and
statistics. The report comes up with some startling conclusions. The
Government claims there is a trend throughout the industrialised world
towards higher pension ages, but the report points out that while many
of our competitor countries have raised retirement ages, nearly 50%
allow women to retire before 65.
Cutting costs on the state pension would help our international
competitiveness, the Government says. The report analyses the costs of
state pensions in 21 countries, uncovering the staggering fact that the
UK's spend per head is less than any developed country. For example, the
US spends 40% more per head on state pensions than we do.
People are living longer and there are fewer children being born to
the taxpayers. The Government feels that if high pensions are paid, the
burden on future generations will be too great. But the report argues it
is too simplistic just to add up the number of people under 65
''supporting'' those over 65.
The ability of people to pay taxes and National Insurance depends on
income. Economic recovery, cuts in unemployment rates, money spent on
education and training would increase the amount of tax received. There
is no need to raise pension ages.
The Government says it does not want to increase National Insurance
levels. The report responds that the Government's figures are out of
date and give a false picture of population growth. The reality, it
says, is that National Insurance may need to rise for a time next
century, but eventually should drop below the present level.
Only time will tell whose figures are correct. One thing is
indisputable: the anticipated saving of the measures (up to #5000m a
year) will be at the expense of an already disadvantaged sector of the
community. Prospects of financial security in retirement are already
hampered by women's life patterns -- career breaks to have children,
looking after dependent relatives, lower paid or part-time work.
Women of 45 and under will be faced with a loss of benefits estimated
at #15,800 each. How many male MPs would vote for a measure which would
cost their young male constituents #15,800 a head? Despite this, the EOC
report is likely to come too late to change Government views or force a
logical compromise.
However, as Stewart Ritchie, pensions director at Scottish Equitable,
puts it: ''It is a mistake to get fixated about state pensions -- the
real issue is that everyone must plan for their own desired standard of
living in retirement, essentially through private provisions.''
The death knell of dependency on the state has been sounded by Michael
Portillo, Secretary of State for Employment. The basic state pension
''is going to be worth a nugatory amount next century''. Therefore,
women in reasonably paid jobs must now make their own provisions for
retirement. Low paid women, who cannot put money aside, will have the
prospect of waiting five years longer to get this ''nugatory amount''.
The Government emphasises the costs of future pension provisions. But
there are more important grounds for being concerned about the adequacy
of pensions and the rise of poverty for pensioners in the future. Sooner
or later, these issues will have to be addressed.

THE Diary can reveal that a rival Blind Date show was put on recently
by the Dundee Business Development Club and was declared an instant
success.
Grampian TV presenter George Duffus was the host of the Professional
Blind Date show which had three teams of accountants, bankers and
solicitors being asked questions by budding entrepreneurs.
It was a lighthearted evening as the following question put to the
accountants will indicate.
''I have started manufacturing an edible anorak, which can be inflated
for use as housing. Can you agree zero rating for this with the Customs
and Excise?''
Or the rather cynical question put to the solicitors which went like
this:
''I have recently had an argument with my solictor who works in a
large office regarding my fees. He said that his firm operated a time
recording system and that he had spent 10 hours on a reasonably
straightforward lease revisale for my office.
''How can I check whether or not he has charged me a reasonable fee
and that in the 10 hours he hasn't been havings cups of coffee, readings
the newspaper and going to the toilet?''
Cilla would have ruled that type of question out as being too saucy!
One to remember -- 25% forgot!
THOUSANDS of businesses up and down the country can be thankful that
it is a holiday weekend.
They are the 25% who ,according to BT, have not yet taken steps to
modify their telephone equipment to take account of the fact that most
national codes have now had a ''1'' insterted after the initial ''0'' so
that the code for Edinburgh from tomorrow onwards will be 0131 and
Glasgow 0141.
The result could be chaos in many offices on Tuesday when business
gets back to normal if for example fax machines have not been
reprogrammed as after tomorrow if callers do not insert the ''1'' then
their calls will not be accepted.
Free lunches go a-begging
MEMBERS of the Dundee &amp; Tayside Chamber of Commerce obviously believe
in the old adage that there is no such thing as a free lunch or they are
trying to tell their director Harry Terrell something.
Harry recently invited members who wanted to air their views on the
Chamber to join him for sandwiches and a glass of wine.
To date only one member has accepted the offer but undaunted Mr
Terrell has repeated his invitation to a free lunch in this month's
Committee Newsletter.
Business Diary readers who are members of the Dundee Chamber and who
fancy a free bite to eat washed down with some wine should give Harry a
call on 01382 201122.
If Harry has to send out for more loaves it will only prove the
pulling power of the press.
PS -- Our advice to the one in five members of the Chamber who have
yet to pay their 1995 subs is that they should think twice about
accepting the offer until they have handed over their cash as they might
discover that there IS no such thing as a free lunch!
Jim anxious for smooth launch
ONE man who will be glad when the mv Isle of Lewis finally slips into
the water at Ferguson Shipbuilders on Tuesday will be Jim Findlay.
Jim, Ferguson's operations director, is the person reponsible for
ensuring that the new Caledonian MacBrayne ferry actually moves when
Princess Alexandra smashes a bottle of Moet Chandon against the side.
While the watching crowd cheer as the champagne bottle shatters
against the ferry's side Jim will be listening anxiously for the double
whistle blast which is the signal for the shipyard workers to remove the
last supports from beneath the ship allowing it to slide gracefully into
the Clyde.
Jim told Business Diary: ''I have witnessed well over a 100 launches
in my time and have been responsible for quite a few, but I will not
relax on Tuesday until the ship is safely in the water.''
Shipbuilding, says Jim, is ''a way of life, and not a job,'' which is
not surprising since he has been building ships since April 1, 1950,
first with Lithgows, and for the last 27 years at Ferguson Shipbuilders.
The only break in this period was when he was hauled off to do his
National Service with the RAF during the Suez Crisis.
Like everyone else at the Port Glasgow yard, Jim is justifiably proud
of the mv Isle of Lewis which is the biggest-ever vessel to be built by
Ferguson.
The ferry is capable of carrying 1000 passengers and 123 cars or
commercial vehicles and will serve the Ullapool-Stornoway route. She
will reduce the travel time by 30% to 2[1/2] hours which will not only
be a boon to islanders but will also open up the Isle of Lewis to day
trippers for the first time.
Four to remember -- for Moat House
BT are not the only people to be have a Phoneday tomorrow. The Moat
House Hotel Group is also changing the number of all their hotels so
that they have 9988 as common last four digits throughout the country.
But Campbell Aird, general manager of the Moat House in Glasgow,
explained to Business Diary that they have built in a number of
safeguards to ensure that callers will still get through even if they
call the old number in three years time!
Mercury, he explains, has a gadget which converts the old number into
the new number, and some 20 of the Moat House Glasgow's 40 lines will
still be able to accept the old number for the next year.
''The number of people using our old number will steadily decline as
people replace the new number in their files, but even in three years
time if someone, say in America, still had our old number and called us
we will have a single line accepting that number.''
Great thinking, Campbell, but you still have to hope that those
outside Glasgow will have made their Phoneday change of inserting the
''1'' into the area code so remember folks from tomorrow the number for
the Glasgow Moat House is 0141 306 9988.
Package deals with a difference
WITH the holiday season approaching, Business Diary came across an
excellent travel book which offered package deals to a wide variety of
destinations.
There is a seven-day visit taking in Tunisia and Morocco or, if you
prefer, a weeklong stay in Israel. Newly popular destinations such as
Cyprus and Turkey are also included.
The booklet gives you the chance to escape from our winter next
January with a trip to Trinidad/Jamaica or you could combine either
Guyana and Puerto Rico with Trinidad.
There are destinations in every continent, South Africa, Mauritius and
Kenya among those in Africa, with Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and the
Philippines available in the Asia-Pacific region, not to forget
Australia, New Zealand, China and Japan.
There are a total of 112 packages, I almost said holidays, included in
the 34-page booklet which you will not find in any travel agent.
It is the British Chambers of Commerce 1995-96 Overseas Trade Missions
Handbook which is now available at any good Chamber of Commerce.
To pre-empt any irate phone calls, Business Diary fully accepts that
trade missions are hard work, those participating rarely see much more
than their hotel room or exhibition hall.
Shareholders set up Scottish branch
BY all accounts the inaugural meeting of the United Kingdom
Shareholders' Association in Perth last Saturday was a success.
Professor Joe Lamb, chairman of Save British Science Campaign, and a
leading light in the ''Gas Greed'' protest by private shareholders in
British Gas addressed the meeting.
Professor Lamb pointed out that the UK lags behind all major
industrial nations in R&amp;D investment. He urged those present to write to
the companies they held shares in asking for details of their R&amp;D
programme and investment levels.
The meeting agreed to form a Scottish branch of the UKSA as a means of
channelling the concerns of private shareholders in Scotland.
Any private shareholder interested in joining should contact Nigel
Dewar Gibb who chaired the meeting on 0141 221 6402 or 0141 339 9666.
Spreading a little starlight
GLASGOW Chamber of Commerce recently received a thank-you letter from
the Starlight Foundation, the charity which helps make the dreams of
seriously ill children come true.
The foundation had approached the chamber to ask for assistance in
making a Clydebank teenager named John's wish for some new denim clothes
come true.
The chamber put the foundation in touch with Jeanster in Glasgow's
Union Street, who helped him pick a huge selection of new clothes, and
generously provided gift vouchers for the rest of his family too.
The day was rounded off by a visit to TGI Fridays, where John and his
family were treated to a ''wonderful meal''.
Val Bovill of the Starlight Foundation was delighted when Business
Diary contacted her, as she said: ''Any publicity you can give us will
make it possible to reach many more children who could benefit from
having a touch of 'magic' added to their young lives, to give them a
very special treat which they can happily remember for as long as they
are able.''
Enough said. If anyone thinks they can help the foundation, her phone
number is 01786 860297.

THERE'S a special 21st birthday party taking place this month, and
it's being held at Stirling Castle.
Very appropriate, really, seeing that it covers the working lifespan
of Stirling Shipping, a subsidiary of that well-known Glasgow company,
Harrisons (Clyde).
And that same Harrisons has been in the news lately, ordering supply
ships, at #12.5m the time, from two different Clyde yards -- Ferguson at
Port Glasgow and Kvaerner Govan. Time for the big time perhaps? Time for
vast leaps forward? Not so, say those at Woodside Crescent. It's merely
prudent expansion, meeting market needs.
Lots of shipping companies have come along, and disappeared. Harrisons
has been one of the quieter movers, and one of the few that has managed
to stay the course, as it happens. As chairman Iain Harrison quietly
says: ''It's good to be a survivor.''
It has been the result of a series of essentially unspectacular
changes, he points out. Moving at a modest pace. Building up a good
reputation over the years for service and dependability. Getting
relationships that have lasted the test of time. Not that Iain Harrison
makes the claims.
He simply says that shipping has been a family pursuit for some time
now. There was the Gow Harrison company, early into tankers just after
the First World War, handling oil from the Persian Gulf. By the next
war, with five tankers out of six having been sunk, it was probably time
for the old firm to be wound up.
''Not finished,'' he explains. ''People were perhaps a bit tired. They
had had enough, for the time being. They took a considered decision to
move out.''
Iain Harrison had gone into the business of learning about ship
management, with companies like Lyle &amp; Clarkson, working in Norway for a
time and returning to Glasgow. It was a time of running smallish cargo
ships to the Baltic, or dry cargo for Lithgow subsidiaries.
''I wasn't all that interested in the Baltic trade, and decided to
split off to start up Harrisons (Clyde) in 1956,'' he recalls. ''That
was made up of three, shall we say older, dry cargo vessels. We were
working for well-known people, Nile Steamship &amp; Dornoch Shipping, from
premises at 62 Buchanan Street.
''That was right opposite the old Glasgow Herald buildings. You could
park in the street any time. You could look out and see their clock.
Always be sure of the time in those days.
''We were carrying anything, anywhere, but a lot of the trade was in
timber from Western Canada. We sold one ship to Cuba, just before Castro
came to power. The next significant move was when the Dornoch company
bought a fine new ship, the Vimeira. It went for well under #1m.
Incredible, compared with today's costs. That was 1959 and we were still
in ship management of course.''
To outsiders, shipping may seem a reasonably romantic way of life.
Lots of voyages to far-away places with strange sounding names. Dealing
in exotic goods. Roaming the world. Reality can be different.
''It's more like a roller-coaster,'' says Iain Harrison. ''You may get
two or three booms. But there are are lots of bursts. It's not exactly
placid. More like a gamble. You're dealing in areas where international
economic trade patterns can change.
''When times are good, people order lots of ships. The market is
flooded. It can take years to get back to some kind of stability. When
you get an oil crisis, everyone wonders if they can possibly continue in
business.''
A major change took place in the sixties with the management of a bulk
carrier, built at Scotts of Greenock, followed some time later by
another from John Brown's at Clydebank. This time, a five-year charter
included a commitment to buy.
''That transformed the whole situation. We had become a company that
was a ship-owner. It means you take on the whole financial risk
involved. It's an exciting situation. When we had another ship built at
John Brown's, we added extra decks.
''For a time we were the biggest car carrier in the world, moving
Toyotas from Japan to the USA. We built another ship, in Bulgaria, and
we managed various ships for other people as well.''
Stirling Shipping was a diversionary move, to spread the risk, going
into supply ships, those 21 years ago. Again, the point was to build up
a good reputation with the oil companies involved, at an appropriate
level of involvement.
''Things change. Last year, we bought a larger platform supply vessel.
This year, we have contracted for two ships. They may not look much,
with a very simple hull, but they're packed with expensive electronic
equipment. Everything from dynamic positioning systems, to high-powered
thrusters and every possible kind of safety gear -- and all at the
lowest possible price,'' he explains.
''You have to keep up with the current trends. You must be able to
offer ships that will take a company into the next century. As people
say, in this business you grow, or you go. Meaning, you go bust. We
intend to stay in business. Very much so. It's good to be building ships
again, in a very competitive market, and on the Clyde.''
Present emphasis may appear to be concentrated on the oil side of
business, but Harrisons will not be walking away from its traditional
dry goods service. There is no question of ignoring the deep-sea market.
This is a company with a #10m turnover. It operates a design service
in addition to management and ownership. There is an office staff of 20.
It even looks after the five Western Ferries vessels that ply the Clyde,
in competition with the much larger CalMac enterprise. Another ferry, to
be named Sound of Scalpay, is being modified on the Clyde now, to come
into service this summer.
Getting back into ship-owning was clearly an important move for the
family. Management is fine, but owning is what it is all about. ''And
it's still a family business,'' Iain Harrison adds proudly.
''It's not just me. There's son-in-law James Cowderoy, our commercial
director, who dealt with the two supply ship contracts. The Ferguson
order will be operated out of Aberdeen on charter to Shell. That's an
important matter for us. James masterminded that situation.
''My son Patrick is a director of the company and deals with
day-to-day ship operations, design work, and specialised vessels we
manage, Morecambe Diver and Bergen Surveyor. My wife, Fabienne, has her
name in John Brown's launch book, directly after the Queen when the QE2
was launched. That's the sort of thing you talk about.
''For the future, well we've established a reputation over the years,
I believe, and there is a lot happening nowadays. We're thoroughly
computerised now. We have our BS5750 quality registration -- and we were
the first in the UK to get that distinction in our line.
''Where do we go now?''
Relaxing in the company boardroom, surrounded by examples of the
Scottish colourists, with Peploe well to the fore, he considers one of
the many ships' models that grace the offices.
''Forward. What else? We will have to expand the equity base. We
believe we will need fresh investment sometime. We are always on the
look-out for new opportunities. Timing of course is vital. There have
been tough times. There always are in this business. But we've survived.
We're professionals. We're a good team.''

SPRING is in the air and early reports from the lambing season suggest
that there is an abundance of lambs. But with the hill lambing season
just about to get underway there are growing fears that losses caused by
foxes could be severe with total losses exceeding a potential #100,000
of lamb sales.
Reports tend to suggest that the Scottish fox population may be
approaching record numbers. Several reasons for this have been put
forward and one is undoubtedly the great comeback by the rabbit over
most of Scotland. There are also fewer gamekeepers on the large estates
to keep numbers under control but a major factor and the one which
really concerns hill sheep farmers are the huge numbers of foxes roaming
in the vast blocks of forestry in the hills and uplands.
Earlier this week at the Annual General Meeting of the Scottish
Landowners' Federation in Bridge of Allan one estate owner accused the
chairman of the Forestry Commission Sir Peter Hutchison of failing to
control vermin in the Commission's vast plantations. Sir Peter almost
avoided giving an answer other than to say: ''I don't really think
that's either true or fair.''
But the same questioner came back later with a valid point when he
said: ''Most owners of woodlands are not seriously interested in
controlling foxes because they don't eat trees. Voles and rabbits do and
foxes control them very effectively.''
It is difficult to put a precise figure on how many lambs are lost but
on some remote Highland hirsels a figure of 10% is accepted as being
close to a realistic average. The many visitors to John Cameron's open
day at Glen Lochay last month month could not fail to notice the 20 plus
fox brushes hanging from a wall.

LUDOVIC Ranfurly's portfolio, which I run on his behalf, ended it
first quarter of 1995 in sound shape, and if it were a little behind the
All-share index it was only by a whisker -- and he might even have been
clean shaven if account were taken of his cash balances.
He had #2743 of cash at the end of last year and added to it the
income of #381 received as dividends from his holdings in the quarter.
With the #25 tax free capital gain he made from a dabble in the English
electricity generators, that gives him #3149 which is in the Abbey
National.
It should be earning money there but no account of that is taken
either, to make some allowance for the fact his automatic reinvestment
of income favourably distorts his performance over a portfolio whose
owner might normally need to spend the cash.
His actual shares (with one Government stock) were worth #40,938,
which hardly changed during the quarter for he started with #40,667.
When the #3149 cash is added, his total rises to #44,087. The comparable
figure at the start of the year was #43,410, so he is making progress,
though like the markets it is more sideways than upwards. (His longer
term followers will remember that he started with #17,000 just over five
years ago.)
It is important to remember the need for patience in equities, for
though they do tend to move upwards over time, the short term graph is
marked by relatively erratic ups and downs, by longish spells of
stagnation (in one of which we have been for over a year) but
occasionally by periods of marked upwards movement, and very
occasionally by sharp downturns (as distinct from corrections).
The strategy behind this portfolio is to sit most movements out but
cream off an occasional profit to diversify the risks and augment the
income flow.
In all such market movements no attention whatever should be paid to
newspaper headlines. We journalists thrive on drama. A few million
pounds still seems a lot of money to us, but it is not so much in the
context of a large international business.
And when indices fall or rise sharply we get excited, a response which
sells papers. The fact is, however, that were the Footsie to rise or
fall 30 points in one day it would represent a movement of approximately
one per cent, but a big movement would be about 50 points.
The effect of newspapers reponse to Stock Exchange valuations is to
exaggerate volatility and frighten readers off holding shares directly.
They imagine by contrast that bonds are safer, and the very opposite is
true: the surest way to diminish the purchasing power of your savings is
to have them all in bonds. (Just to complicate our lives, that may not
be true at the moment when we are close to a world wide deflation; but
timing an exit from bonds is difficult and small holders tend to become
bemused by the high income delivered.)
Ludo's one bond, which has performed poorly as it happens, overcomes
the normal worries attatched to such things by being linked to inflation
both in its capital value and income. I see it, therefore, as a long
term insurance policy and am not too worried by its price movements,
though if deflation were to become marked it might need reassessing.
Of Ludo's holdings the only one to dip much was Scottish Power which
fell by about 10%. This is somewhat worrying, though the roughly similar
trend at Hydro is somehow reassuring since it suggests that the doubts
about the larger company may not be tied to its strong move into
retailing electrical goods where competition is intense, sales are
slack, especially with dearer items and margins are thin.
Of the other holdings there is little dramatic to say. The Royal Bank,
now his biggest holding in spite of taking a good slice of profit, is
still setting a hot pace on dividend increases.
Bats, the second largest holding, delivers a very good return as well.
It has substantially increased its presence in the American tobacco
industry but worries about its exposure to lawsuits, as sufferers from
nicotine related diseases try to assault it in the courts, will
inevitably prevent enjoying a higher stock market rating. It ought,
however, to go on achieving higher earnings, and its large financial
business will act as something of a cushion should the tobacco business
ever seriously wilt. Ludo having been a smoker himself has no qualms
over Bats cigarette business.
British Telecom also is performing well and its yield of 5.5% (and
growing) is acceptable. The market is valuing it cautiously, but I have
stopped quarrelling with that (since it is a fact) and continue to hold
the shares as a solid prop. In the next few quarters I shall have to
address the question of its future (and that of the other utilities)
should there be a Labour Government. The market may increasingly allow
for that (it has an uncanny ability to discount bad news well in
advance) but to the extent that it does BT's undervaluation may persist.
BP by contrast should be all right and will show very well if the
dollar recovers. It does show the value of holding on to large blue chip
stocks through bad times. A more nimble approach would have sold two or
so years ago and bought back, but I did not manage that.
With Foreign and Colonial, I did manage to reduce Ludo's holding at a
good time and enhanced his income flow by buying some Sainsbury (which I
see from F&amp;C's latest accounts they themselves bought about the same
time). F&amp;C remains in the portfolio and continues to offer an
international spread and sound currency management as well as good stock
picking. It is now dear, but not yet too dear.
Sainsbury is still caught up in the UK supermarkets war, but is
diversifying abroad and has taken a further big leap into DIY retailing
by buying Texas. It should easily be able to afford to keep its
dividends rising; and that outcome applies to Zeneca as well.
The point to keep in mind is that capital growth will eventually
follow income growth. This portfolio's income is steadily going up.
HOW A WINDFALL TURNED INTO A PORTFOLIO
LUDOVIC'S portfolio has been running for six years. He was a friend
who asked me to manage a windfall, a maturing insurance policy for
#17,000.
He decided it should really be for the benefit of his wife,
Dervorguilla (Gilly), in the event of his death. For that reason income
was an unimportant consideration and indeed it was to be automatically
re-invested, as it has been. It is therefore a total return portfolio,
combining capital appreciation with the re-invested dividends.
I agreed to run it at no cost in advisory fees so that, with their
real identities concealed, I could show whether Scots with relatively
small sums of money can venture into share markets which present some
degree of risk. Would they do better than leaving the money in a safe
bank deposit of building society account.
I am an enthusiast for share ownership, even, maybe especially, of
shares in very large companies which might seem fuddy duddy but which,
more often than not, grow steadily.
He started with five shares and an investment trust savings scheme. He
now has a portfolio of eight companies (including the trust) and a
Government stock, index linked so as to be invulnerable to inflation.
With luck and a bit of opportunism, his assets have grown to #44,000
and he has not had, on their account, a single sleepless night.
He might have done even better with a little mora active trading but
the essence of the argument is that even without the time involved in
constant market activity, it is possible to augment capital and provide
a future income stream superior to a more cautious approach.

A THREE year turnround in the fortunes of agriculture means the
industry is set for a bright and prosperous future-if the current
benefits are put to good use, according to David Douglas, Agricultural
Manager of the Clydesdale Bank.
At the annual meeting of the rural branch of the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors in Edinburgh yesterday he said there had been an
amazing change in the farming economy since 1992.
Base rates were lower, the ERM had been left and the CAP reforms had
changed from being a threat to providing a positive cash boost. As a
result farm incomes had improved, confidence was high and the demand for
farms and farmland was once again outstripping supply.
From the pessimism of 1992 there was now cautious optimism.
But Mr Douglas stated: ''It would be wrong to ignore the fact that
last year's farm incomes total for Scotland was #381m of which subsidies
contributed #332m. Subsidy payments were extremely visible in many farm
accounts which at some point may pose a threat to the future development
of some businesses.
''We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the subsidy issue but we
must use the boost in incomes achieved last year to secure long term
gains.''
He said Scottish agriculture had strengths of compactness, ease of
communications and a reputation for quality and individuals with strong
balance sheets had opportunities for growth and expansion
''None of us would have predicted these favourable conditions in 1992
but havingreached 1995 in good economic health we should make the very
bests of the chance to plan and build for an even brighter and more
prosperous future.''

I'VE been playing a daily business game these past few months. It
takes up quite a chunk of my working day, and produced more than its
fair share of frustration.
It's called Telephone Ping Pong. It is sponsored by BT and Mercury.
And it involves making countless, useless phonecalls trying to get hold
of someone who is tied up on the phone trying to get hold of someone who
is tied up . . .
What a colossal waste of time and money the whole phone business has
become! Everyone I know in business complains bitterly about the
increasing difficulty they experience in reaching the people they need.
Without exaggeration, I would now describe the phone as one of the prime
inhibitors of business rather than, as it used to be, a major
facilitator of business.
At the very same time as companies spend fortunes on improving
efficiency and reducing costs, another fortune is being wasted through
delays caused by the simple inability to reach key people. Projects sit
idly on the shelf waiting for a decision from someone who seems to be
permanently unavailable.
I'm convinced that the phone is also a substantial contributor to the
pressures and the hours of which we also complain. It no longer delivers
what it used to promise -- instant contact. I can see that in a reverse
kind of way there is the potential to create a new league table of
senior business people, this time based on how many calls it takes to
actually reach the great person.
A 10-call person is pretty lowly, but once you get to the 50-plus call
MD or chairman you know you're dealing with real status!
I've been chasing a chap for 10 days now for a decision on a project.
I must have called over 20 times, he's called a few and we have yet to
hit on a time that is mutually convenient. It would be easier going to
see him and sitting on his doorstep until he's free.
Having created the situation, technology is now naturally offering
solutions via devices such as voice banks, telemessaging, automatic
switching around departments, and automatic redialling of engaged
numbers. That's acceptable to some of us, but to others possessing
either little patience or little empathy with technology it can be like
diving into marshmallow.
Recently my wife, who writes for this splendid organ, ended up almost
screaming in frustration at the British Pharmaceutical Society in London
after being unwillingly sent on an infuriating telephonic journey around
its inanimate network, where progress can only be made by pressing the
right buttons in response to recorded messages. After progressing around
four departments she finally reached her destination -- a recording
machine.
These devices originated from the US and they should have stayed
there. They are the most user-unfriendly modes of communication yet
known to Telephonic Man, and I cannot believe that the people who
install them have ever tried to reach themselves by phone.
Of course the more organised among us, generally the people running
the Insider 500 companies, have our lives patrolled and controlled by
efficient secretaries who slice each day into its necessary components.
They have their set times when they call out, and if they are well
organised the recipients are usually briefed to wait for the phone to
ring.
That's tough luck for the poor souls who are trying to call in for
them, but then that is modern executive power for you. And after all,
the only important calls are the ones that you want to make!
You'll be unsurprised to learn that I have no startlingly original
answers to offer to this situation, but I can see a way in which
business could make life on the phone easier for all. The starting point
is surely that we must all create some house rules within our companies
on how and when we use the phone. (A consultant would probably call it
''A Telephonic Interface Strategy''.)
By this I mean that specific times will be set aside each day when we
call out or leave the lines available for callers-in. For example, if
each company put on its stationery that, barring emergencies, no outside
calls would be made between, say, 10-11am, then customers, suppliers and
other important people know that offers their best chance of getting
hold of us.
To take the concept further, perhaps it would also make sense for a
Business to agree matching times for calls in and out with its network
of supplying and supporting companies. That way the working day can be
better compartmentalised for everyone, and hopefully phone frustration
reduced.
My only other suggestion is to publish a Who's Who of top people's
secretaries and rank them according to helpfulness in allowing access to
their masters. Any volunteers to carry out the research!

ANDREW Yule Insurance of Glasgow is guaranteeing to undercut any
direct motor insurance renewal premium by 10%. Managing director Andrew
Yule says the company is finding more and more customers of direct
insurers are coming to it and saying their premiums on renewal have gone
up considerably. The company will offer equivalent cover at premiums 10%
below these renewal quotations.
Fund to launch
INVESCO is shortly to launch its Premier Select Asian Convertible Bond
Fund. This will invest in Euro-convertible bonds issued by companies in
the East Asian region, from India to China, with the portfolio likely to
include property, infra-structure, energy and electronics. Convertibles
give some exposure to equities but are less volatile while offering a
high yield. The fund's starting yield will be 6.7%, with scope for
capital growth.
Fees reduced
THORNTON Unit Managers has reduced the initial charge on its unit
trusts and PEPs to 4% and 3% respectively.
Flexible plan
KLEINWORT Benson has begun its Flexible Investment Scheme which will
be a convenient means of investing in its range of 17 unit trusts and 12
investment trusts. Minimum investment is #25 a month or a lump sum of
#500. The scheme allows switching between investments at low cost, 1% in
respect of investment trusts.
Charges down
MORGAN Grenfell has lowered its initial charge on PEP investments to
3%. Most of its funds have a minimum investment of #1000 or #25 a month.
Morgan says its performance record across the range of its funds has
been in the top three for seven years.
Mortgage help
FIRST Mortgage Securities has issued a free guide to repayment
mortgages, explaining the difference between these mortgages and
interest-only loans and indicating how monthly costs can be calculated.
Copies can be obtained by telephoning 0171 836 3863.
Free valuation
ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester Building Society is offering free valuation and
unemployment protection for a year with its latest fixed-rate mortgages
which include a two-year fix at 5.95%.

BEWARE - in a few months from now you are going to be faced with a
deluge of personal equity plans which will be offering temptingly high
tax-free yields.
Among them will be the new corporate bond PEPs which many companies
are preparing to launch following the publication of the Inland
Revenue's draft regulations on how they will work. These rules are
expected to be finalised by July 1.
Corporate bond PEPs won't be right for everyone even though the unit
trust marketing people will try to persuade you that they are an offer
you cannot afford to refuse.
It may not be easy to resist the temptation though, and ''the
education of the savings market'', as investment bank BZW puts it, is
expected to lead to flows of #6000m into these PEPs before the end of
the decade.
The new PEPs will invest in fixed-interest stock, issued by companies
that want to borrow money from investors for a limited period. The
Government's intention is to provide medium-sized companies with more
opportunities for raising cash from the City, rather than being
restricted to bank finance or development capital as has been the case
up to now. However, it has yielded to pressure from fund managers to
allow Euro Sterling Bonds issued by large companies, such as BT and
British Gas, to be included in these PEPs too.
So who should invest in the new corporate bond PEPs? Investors for
whom they are likely to be most suitable are those needing a high fixed
and regular income, and not requiring capital growth. For someone in the
later stages of retirement, for instance, they will undoubtedly prove
attractive. Other investors will need to look critically at whether this
type of PEP is really for them.
Even the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, which has
warmly welcomed the Inland Revenue's recent proposals, advises caution.
''Savers will need to understand three things,'' says AUTIF director
general Philip Warland. ''First, a bond fund is not a deposit account.
The price of the fund will fluctuate, unless there is a guaranteed fund.
Second, high income now will almost always lead to a lower total return
over the long run. If you need income now, fine, but if you are really
saving for the long term, a traditional equity fund may be better.
''Third, although there is no simple rule that says high yields are
bad, and low yields are good, if investors encounter a particularly high
yielding fund they must ensure they know why it looks so attractive.
There could be a good manager. Perhaps charges are taken from capital.
The portfolio may be riskier than normal.''
Mr Warland has highlighted the possible risks and the fact that not
all bond PEPs will be the same. Others within the industry are also
concerned that the risks should not be ignored. Bob Watson, investment
marketing manager of Britannia Fund Managers, the Glasgow-based unit
trust arm of the Britannia Building Society which has an existing bond
fund, stresses: ''It is important that bond PEPs are not marketed as
totally safe and secure investments.''
It will be the yields of the new PEPs that will be their chief
attraction. But when comparing the yields, investors will need to look
carefully at two aspects of each fund. Different investment policies
will produce different yields. Some funds may mix corporate bonds with
other investments such as gilts or equities, which may pull down their
yields somewhat. Or they may concentrate on different types of corporate
bonds, such as debentures, unsecured loans, or convertibles, while
others may boost their yields by focusing on Preference shares.
The quality of bonds chosen will also play a part. Corporate bonds are
only as secure as the companies which issue them. Smaller companies
normally have to pay higher yields to attract investors because of the
greater risk. Even apparently safe bets may not be as secure as they
seem though, an obvious example being Barings Bank debentures, which
became worthless when the bank collapsed earlier this year.
Another factor to consider is whether the annual charge -- which is
usually between 1% and 1.5% -- is deducted from the fund's income or
capital. Increasingly, managers have started taking this charge from
capital so they can boost fund yields. But some companies are sticking
to the traditional method of taking charges from income.
Fidelity Investments, which has announced it will be offering two
corporate bonds PEPs, adopts this approach. Director Mary Blair says:
''By not chasing the highest yields, nor taking charges from capital, we
feel we will be better able to preserve the investors capital.'' If an
investor's capital starts to dwindle, this will also impact on future
income.
So what kind of returns can investors expect from bond PEPs? A number
of similar funds are already up and running. Over the past year, because
of poor markets, they have shown an average loss of around 4.5%
according to Micropal, even with income taken into account. Over three
years, the total return averages 21.4%, but most of that gain comes from
income.
The scope for capital growth is limited. Veteran financial adviser
Peter Edwards of Premier Unit Trust Brokers, who has examined the past
performance of the existing corporate bond unit trusts, warns: ''Don't
believe the managers of any such new funds yielding more than 8% if they
promise you 'excellent prospects for capital appreciation' as well.
We'll believe it when we see it.''

* In your reply on March 18 to an elderly inquirer in receipt of
Invalidity Benefit you stated that the new Incapacity Benefit, like the
old Invalidity Benefit, could be claimed until age 65, at which point
payment would continue at the same rate but as state retirement pension.
This is not so.
Incapacity Benefit can continue in payment for current recipients of
Invalidity Benefit until age 70, provided you have been getting
Invalidity Benefit without a break since December 1, 1993 or earlier,
were aged 58 or over on April 13, and your doctor continues to certify
you as unfit to work.
For people in this category the benefit will continue to be not
taxable. Obviously it is advantageous for any income tax payer to
continue to claim the benefit. This will only happen, however, if the
recipient takes positive action, in other words does not complete the
claim form for state retirement pension automatically sent out by the
DSS before his or her 65th birthday and does notify the local DSS office
which currently pays the Incapacity Benefit of the desire to continue
claiming Invalidity/Incapacity Benefit. If you stop claiming Invalidity
or Incapacity Benefit you may be able to reclaim it in certain
circumstances -- or you may not.
I think it is most important that anyone currently in receipt of
Invalidity Benefit should be fully aware of these and other facts
relating to the changes being made in this allowance. DSS leaflet IB201
gives full details.
* The Benefits Agency has confirmed that our reply to the question on
March 18 was correct insofar as it applied to a woman, which admittedly
was not clear from the question nor the answer. If you are a man of 65
or over on April 12, you can choose to remain in receipt of the
long-term rate of Incapacity Benefit until the age of 70. As you point
out, the benefit is not taxable so this option is clearly worth taking
up.
Your point about being aged 58 or over relates only to testing for
incapacity to work. This will not be required if you have been getting
Invalidity Benefit without a break since December 1, 1993 or earlier,
and were aged 58 or over on April 13. Certain categories of people are
also exempt.
The procedure for doctors is that they supply a certificate of
incapacity for the first 28 weeks. Then they have to apply a further
certificate explaining the condition of the patient. The DSS will say
whether an incapacity test is required.
All eligible people receive information about taking up the state
pension when they reach the appropriate age, but those who were in
receipt of Invalidity Benefit should have also received a covering
letter explaining that they could remain on Incapacity Benefit for a
further five years.
* We would like to start alterations to our house in May but would
need to borrow #5000, say, over five years, though we may be able to pay
it back at the end of two or three years. What is the cheapest way of
financing this?
* The most flexible way would be through an overdraft on normal terms,
that is a few percentage points over base rate. Assuming you currently
have a mortgage you could consider just increasing this, depending on
the costs involved and the loan-to-house value ratio. You could then
make a partial capital repayment when you could afford to.
Otherwise, you could arrange a loan secured on your house, though
expenses might outweigh the interest advantage over a personal loan, the
other alternative. First Direct and Royal Bank of Scotland are
particularly competitive for secured loans as is Clydesdale Bank for
personal loans. In all cases check the charge, if any, for early
repayment. If there is one it would be worth haggling as lenders are
crying out for people to borrow from them.

My husband and I plan to retire, taking voluntary redundancy in
approximately three years when we will both be in our middle fifties. We
will have index-linked pensions of #13,000 and #12,000 with lump sums
totalling #65,000. We have no mortgage and our house is currently valued
at #70,000.
Until we retire we are building up a nest egg saving approximately
#1000 a month. At present we have it invested in Abbey National accounts
-- #12,000 in the investment account, #26,000 in the triple bond,
#10,000 in the high yield bond, and two Tessas each with #7216. We have
BT shares to the value of #20,000. We also have Legal and General
cashbuilder policies to mature in 2006 and at present valued at #23,000.
We have both worked hard to build up our savings and are reluctant to
invest in PEPs in case we lose money. However, I would welcome your
advice on helping to ensure a comfortable retirement. Also, is it
worthwhile contributing to full capacity for three years to my husband's
company's AVCs?
* It seems you will be exceptionally well placed to enjoy a
comfortable retirement in three years. You already have #62,000 with the
Abbey National, and will have saved a further #36,000 by then. In
addition you have #20,000 invested in BT shares, and lump sums of
#65,000 to look forward to. In all this amounts to more than #180,000,
from which you could expect to derive a substantial income. You can
probably afford to leave your Legal and General policies to mature in
2006, eight years after you retire.
Your pensions will total #25,000 a year, and are index-linked,
providing valuable protection against an upsurge in inflation at some
stage during your retirement. However, your capital is mainly tied up in
cash deposits, whose value would be eroded by the passage of time even
if inflation remains at current moderate levels.
We would, therefore, like to see a greater proportion of your funds
tied up in equity-type investments to provide capital growth. Since you
are saving #1000 a month, regular subscriptions to a number of
investment trust savings schemes would be an ideal way of doing this. It
does not seem to us that you need to increase your large cash deposits
at this stage so we would suggest the bulk of your monthly savings go
into investment trusts, which are an ideal way of providing the small
investor with capital growth over the long term.
It is a pity that your #20,000 is tied up in just one share, and we
would suggest consulting a stockbroker about spreading this around a
bit, perhaps between about half-a-dozen shares. He or she would also be
able to advise you about the investment of your lump sum in three years,
and might persuade you to reduce your current cash holdings to permit
further investment in equities.
You should not rule out PEPs. The tax benefits are real, especially
when you have substantial capital. But it is important that the
underlying investments are good. You would not go far wrong if some of
the funds going into investment trusts were held through PEPs.
Three years is not a long time to benefit from AVCs, and whether it
would be worthwhile for your husband to do so is difficult to gauge on
the limited information we have. He might like to seek further advice on
this point from his company's pension fund managers.
* I have been a widow for 32 years and am now aged 64. My entire
income is #99.88 per week made up of state industrial death benefit of
#57.60, retirement pension of #17.28 and my late husband's pension of
just under #100 per month. I have to pay income tax of #440 per year as
I have #10,000 in Income Bonds and a little in a building society
account.
As I have to find this money from my savings this is leaving me almost
in dire straights. My many widow friends, all much better off than me,
pay less in tax and some don't even fill in a tax return. Can you please
help with advice as I cannot afford professional assistance.
* By our calculations your income tax liability is broadly correct and
you are paying tax at a rate of 20% on the excess of your income before
tax over your personal allowance of #3525.
We think your problem may be that tax is not deducted at source from
your National Savings Income Bonds. These pay an attractive rate of
monthly interest of 6.5%, but you must remember to save an amount
equivalent to your tax liability out of each receipt. You could switch
to a building society account where tax is deducted at source, but few
offer as attractive a rate of interest.
The good news is that once you reach age 65 you are entitled to a
higher tax-free age allowance -- if you will be 65 in 1995/96 your
allowance will be #4630. This should reduce your tax bill by #221, and
you should make sure you notify the Inspector of Taxes of your
eligibility for age allowance as soon as possible.

* The bonus payment of shares for existing savers in Halifax and Leeds
building societies will be welcomed when the company is floated in 1997.
But what happens to savers in Tessa accounts which mature in the
interim? Can the legal limit of #9000 be re-invested in the same account
and thus be eligible for the handout, or will a new account have to be
opened which may not be eligible for bonus shares?
* This is not a problem so long as, on maturity, the sum is kept with
the Halifax in a suitable account whether it be a another Tessa, 90-day
or instant access account. You just have to move your account into a new
one on the same day as it matures. This also applies for
Save-As-You-Earn plans.
For anyone who has a query about the Halifax/Leeds merger and plc
proposals, the Halifax operates an information service on 0800 888844.
* I am an OAP whose investments are limited and are invested in Income
Bonds at the current rate of 6.5%. I pay no income tax. I note that you
advised an engineer to re-invest savings certificates in Pensioners'
Bonds offering 7.5%. Would you advise me to change over and, if so, what
exactly are these bonds?
* The interest on Pensioners' Bonds is paid gross of tax so, as a
non-taxpayer, you would receive the full 7.5% return paid monthly.
However, this is fixed for five years no matter how interest rates
generally move. There is also a 60-day notice of withdrawal period and
no interest is earned during this on the money to be withdrawn.
Your Income Bonds returning 6.5% gross are variable, moving up or down
with the market. The trend in interest rates is upwards though this can
change. You have to give three months notice of withdrawal for Income
Bonds, but interest continues to be paid.
You have to decide whether it is worth tying your money up for five
years to earn the extra one point or whether rates are likely to move up
to that level anyway or perhaps even fall. Analysts do expect rates to
rise further, but it is difficult to say at what level they might peak
and when. What one can say is that the 7.5% on Pensioners' Bonds is
guaranteed come what may.
* I have contacted several tax offices in an effort to get an answer
to a question on certifying for gross interest. My husband has retired
through ill health and receives an occupational pension which is less
than his personal tax allowance. His tax office, therefore, advised that
the married couples allowance be transferred to me and my code number
for the new tax year is 421T.
I have been transferring our savings around to maximise this benefit
and to receive the highest rates of interest available, but when
enquiring about gross interest I was told I could be fined about #3000
for self-certifying for more than the personal tax allowance. I do not
see the point of giving me the married allowance if I cannot make use of
it. Surely I should be able to certify up to the level of my code.
* This is a common misconception. You can only register to have
interest paid gross if your total income before tax from all sources is
less than your personal allowance. If your total income before tax,
including earnings and pension, is more, interest must be paid subject
to deduction of tax at source, although you will be able to reclaim tax
paid which is more than you are due. This ensures you get the benefit of
the married couples allowance, although you must remember that tax
relief for this is only given at 15% for 1995/96.

ELECTRICITY
Victoria Glendinning
Hutchinson, #14.99
VICTORIA Glendinning's is a name redolent of
intellectuality-with-sensibility. The ultimate fin de siecle literary
woman, distinguished biographer, broadcaster, brunette-with-bones,
gardener, critic. Electricity is a bit of a polysyllabic wham-bam title
that brings to mind other one-word titles: Meony, Lace, Damage, the
blockbusterishness of an Amis, a Conran, or a Hart. The seeming
mis-match of Ms Glendinning and her new title is an awkwardness that
lurks like a loose connection among the circuitry of her second novel.
The plain story of Charlotte Mortimer is set in the era of the advent
of electricity. As she awaits the arrival of a lodger, Peter Fisher, in
her family's gas-lit suburban parlour, we are quickly appraised of her
father's mismanaged sensuality, her mother's narrow, troubled mousiness,
and her own 18-year-old stirrings. Pace, not complexity, will drive the
plot, and electricity, we understand, is to signal every sort of
current.
Peter Fisher arrives, bringing the new age with him. He has wild black
hair, green eyes, glasses, and a zeal for the new science of electricity
that is more metaphysical than pedantic. Charlotte herself is clever.
Peter Fisher is her way onwards, upwards, and outwards.
They are quickly married, but not before Charlotte's Aunt Susannah,
newly widowed and another acknowledged sensualist, joins the household,
contributing another electrical charge to the badly wired menage. When
Fisher is asked to plan and effect the electrification of a stately home
the newlyweds move into an estate lodge and the story takes a lurch
towards a light period of romance. George Godwin, an amusing bachelor,
is lord of the manner. Suburban, self-watching Charlotte, neither a
victim nor a fool, succumbs to afternoon sessions in the barn and
discovers she can love two men at once.
It is here that the gremlins in the system start to show up.
Glendinning is writing straight accessible plot-driven fiction with all
the complexity held in the metaphor. The plan is just too cool to work.
Charlotte is made a vehicle for women's choices, the Pandora-ish
acquisition of knowledge or faith-keeping ignorance. Her dilemma becomes
too coolly symbolic, not enough of a sweated-over, lived-out moral and
emotional struggle.
Switched on or switched off she is not as much in control as she
thinks, and Glendinning's careful avoidance of turning her into either
Victorian emotional virgin or period adultress is a considerable
achievement. In fact she is basking in the emancipation of an easy,
intellectual relationship with both men, anticipating the next century's
mixed, platonic society without its fully fledged context. Too early to
have it all, her mental development has to happen within a sexual
context. This is a theme that calls out to be developed -- Charlotte's
sexuality is not entirely convincing, and a little less malleability
would raise the voltage of the plot. Meanwhile, as Fisher measures,
calculates, designs, and wires the ancient rooms Charlotte's idyll has
an end-by date.
At the switch-on party the wider world floods in, the society women
already clued up on fashion colours and make-up that will withstand the
bleaching effect of electric light.
Charlotte, returned to the realities of her period and place, to
Peter's egg-headedness and failure to chop firewood, axes off her toes
while trying to do it herself. Godwin takes her to recuperate in the
house. Peter is electrocuted. Godwin's habitual philandering is
revealed, and the happy singularity of her road through life turns out,
after all, to be a well-trodden path. A closet intellectual, though, she
learns and adapts.1  Glendinning appears to be siting her novel
somewhere between the researched, explored piece of her own inclination
and the pared-down, passionate, unexamined piece that the numbers market
demands.
A true mass market writer, though, would have put a howling
sound-track to everything -- the decorous foot-chopping scene, the
electrocution, the tussles in the hay, the mildly horrible father. Her
natural readers, on the other hand, will lament the under-developed
ideas that stew the plot, and find the meticulous research little
compensation.

THE CUNNING MAN
Robertson Davies
Viking, #15.50
ROBERTSON Davies is fascinated by humanity. Every aspect of our
behaviour seems to intrigue him. Especially the conditions which combine
to form our personalities. Like other Canadian writers -- Alice Munro,
Margaret Atwood, and Carol Shields -- Davies is out to uncover what
lurks beneath the surface. Personality components we may neither know
nor understand. The search takes his narratives through recent Canadian
history.
Davies has a wonderful array of skills, blended with a fierce
intelligence and sympathy for those whose predicaments he exposes and
exploits. What makes him superiorly different is an unbridled
finely-honed sense of irony, which lurks behind every situation. Even
though one cannot see the immediate application or relevance one is
always suspicious of his more outlandish devisings.
This is especially obvious when he faces Canada's changing life and
customs. He is such an easy and established, cynical observer of public
rituals and hypocrisies, that the way he applies his findings could
simply be overlooked. He is open to all that is new and strange, to
every development and behavioural nuance. A lesser novelist could well
lose sight of such intentions. But no matter how Davies compresses his
plots or shifts the intellectual focus, he not only carries his readers,
but also prevents distractions, or intellectual fidgeting.
Davies never lets his findings veer into mysticism, nor does he gather
arguments to assert his foregone conclusions. And though this book has a
rambling appearance, his many devoted readers will already know it is
beautifully and subtly structured.
His great gift is story telling. Everything is subjected to that
discipline. I know of few writers who can so successfully hide the act
of creation. It is possible to read pages, whole chapters even, without
being conscious of anything other than the narrative. There is always
something happening, but what is happening is not always obvious.
For Davies asks us to treasure society and preserve its values. To
respect each other and reject the flash and urbane, especially in
technology, where, he realises, we are easily fooled. He is not afraid
to chide and rebuke us, but his philosophical observations always rise
naturally from his characters and their relations with each other, or
from their personalities.
This story begins on Good Friday 1951 in St Alden's Church, Toronto,
where a High Anglican mass is being celebrated. Father Ninian Hobbs dies
as the communion wafer is being raised to his lips, something which
convinces his zealously pious curate that Hobbs is a saint. Hobbs's
friend Dr Jonathan Hullah, who witnesses the priest's exit, suspects
human rather than divine intervention. These events are little more than
a memory until 1985, when a young woman journalist interviews Hullah
about the Hobbs demise. Hullah has recently retired and with time on his
hands tries to bring the Hobbs events together, maybe even understand
their implication, by setting them down on paper, an exercise which
swells into autobiography.
This device gives the narrative a range and intimacy Davies obviously
savours, allowing ample opportunity to state and develop his abounding
interests, from having Hullah cured in childhood by a Red Indian shamen
to medical discourses and philosophical considerations combining many of
the interests which have surfaced in previous novels, from unexplained
death and high church ritual, to art, science, literature and, most
importantly, entertaining conversation.
Davis unashamedly resurrects the novel of ideas, but here it is
peppered with characters who are revealed through their actions. That
these branches of literature are usually considered distinctly separate
and that they are combined so easily is simply part of Robertson
Davies's wonderful skills, confirming what his readers had always
suspected, that at 82 years of age he is the cunning man of the title.

VAMPS AND TRAMPS,
NEW ESSAYS
Camille Paglia
Viking, #17
CAMILLE Paglia argues during the first few chapters of her book --
Vamps and Tramps, New Essays -- that ''art and pornograph,  not
politics, show us the real truth about sex''. Paglia is a hardcore,
militant American-Italian intellectual, whose remit is to explain sexual
politics to the rest of the human race. A sort of feminist version of
Doctor Ruth.
Paglia is a product of a highbrow education, and her diatribes are
never simple. She uses an awful lot of words to make one point. Her work
is a response, a rage against the stifling political correctness which
saturates American university campuses. To understand her you have to
imagine the hysteria of the student mentality. It would seem that in
America, feminism has evolved into a new, self-indulgent cult, where
women believe that they can do as they like, wear what they want, say
what they want, and be as flirtatious and as slutty as they desire in
the name of emancipation.
But, Camille argues, feminists must take personal responsibility for
their actions. Not all men are new men. Put it this way. According to
Paglia, to go out and pick up a stranger in order to have casual sex may
be a woman's prerogative in a tolerant society, but it's dangerous. And
she's right.
Camille Paglia is well narked off at the safe, bourgeois feminism
which  expects automatic respect. Its success, she says, depends on men
being nice, and the world being a fair and harmless, fluffy utopia. She
is contemptible of the white, middle-class student, the yuppie feminist
with her prom-queen preen. ''Dollhouse moppets'' she calls them;
ill-equipped, ill-educated, and deluded.
Paglia suggests, interestingly, that eating disorders are the refuge
of such spineless creatures, the over-protected and over-privileged, who
don't want to grow up and accept responsibility for their sexual power,
who want to rid themselves, through bulemia or anorexia nervosa, of
every lust-inducing curve. (Princess Di came to mind.) Sex, she asserts,
should be raw and dirty, a personification of the present struggle
between men and women.
Art, and its poor cousin, pornography, convey sex as an accessible
human right. The intrusion of politics upon sex have made it a
troublesome arena where girls and boys are unsure of the boundaries,
vague about where a compliment becomes sexual harassment, when a
one-night stand becomes rape. Paglia's mission in Vamps and Tramps is to
present the less savoury aspects of male and female sexuality in order
that women initiate a move along from sexuo-political ideology, and
acknowledge the crude, sexist dynamics of human nature.
There is no rational reason for this, no sound argument other than it
makes life more interesting. To draw nearer to accepting that true
equality may not be possible, is to leave thick, uninspiring,
politically correct theory behind.
Paglia believes that the real tough cookies, the true feminists, are
women who are either vamps or tramps, because they are strong enough to
be vulnerable to sexual suggestion. She infers that women who sell sex
are in control of it; that women who fear sexual attention in the
workplace or in the home are subsumed by it. Paglia doesn't want women
to resort to legislation or police protection to cushion them from seedy
psychopaths, she wants women to handle the danger from a twisted male
sexuality themselves. This is her argument for equality. Men have to
learn to defend themselves, why can't women? This point harps back to
the first years of feminism.
After being introduced to the idea of women having the vote, men
argued that if women wanted to vote they had to bear arms. They had to
help preserve the political freedom they wanted to share. Paglia
concedes that it is still a man's world. And that successful women must
make war.
''Conservative women like Margaret Thatcher have found it easier to
reach the highest post in their countries. If we are ever to have a
woman President, she must, like Thatcher, demonstrate her readiness and
ability to command the military.''
Paglia is original. For instance, she sees rape as breaking and
entering, not as bullying, not as the physically stronger exploiting the
weaker sex. She likens the motivation of the rape act to men wanting to
steal from people they envy. She says that men are jealous of the sexual
power women have and in order to humiliate they take it without
permission.
Paglia is a right-wing libertarian, a bigmouth bisexual. She hates
weakness. She wants women to be warriors. Her dual-sexuality may explain
why she seems to side with men and their prejudices. Hers is often a
defeatist attitude. Men can't change, so women must. It's not a great
deal of a life, to take on the mental gymnastics of analysing culture in
order to find something new to say.
If feminist theory, rather than practice, must continue, it needs its
leaders. Paglia is a trail-blazer. She must be congratulated for her
imagination and her determination to see feminism evolve. Whatever her
latest ideology, or cause for grievance, her aim is to kick hard against
any sloppiness of cultural thought. At the very least Camille Paglia is
a monitor of the impact women and their pursuit of equal rights are
making. At the most, a verbose critic, who publishes their mistakes.

LANDSCAPE AND MEMORY
Simon Schama
HarperCollins, #30
THE history of landscape, as everyone knows, is not real history. What
we think of as real history flickers on the edge of the natural world.
To see how the two histories connect -- to see how in one way or another
the natural world surrenders itself to real history -- requires the
abstraction that only the passing of time allows. It also requires a
historian like Simon Schama.
Historians are supposed to reach the past always through texts,
occasionally through images. In Schama, Old Dominion Professor of the
Humanities at Columbia University in New York, we are lucky to have
somebody who is capable of experiencing ''a sense of place'', of using
''the archive of the feet''. He was widely acclaimed for The
Embarrassment of Riches, his book about the Netherlands in its
seventeeenth-century Golden Age, and also for Citizens, a bicentenary
chronicle which turned the French Revolution into an international
blockbuster.
His latest subject is landscape myth and memory. At the heart of the
project stands a vast 600-page work which Schama has researched over
many years, but it also entails a series of five BBC2 programmes written
and presented by the author. By exploring the impact which the natural
world has had on our culture and imagination, the book and the films set
out to investigate the way in which human society has shaped the
landscape to answer its own needs. ''For although we are accustomed to
separate nature and human perception into two realms,'' writes Schama,
''they are, in fact, indivisible. Before it can ever be a repose for the
senses, landscape is the work of the mind. Its scenery is built up as
much from strata of memory as from layers of rock.''
As he acknowledges, the idealisation of rural life has always been a
part of urban culture. People who live in the country grow accustomed to
being misunderstood and transmogrified by townies. The most obvious
example is ''Resolution and Independence'', in which Wordsworth asks the
leech-gatherer about his philosophy of life, but is so excited to be
meeting a yokel that he forgets to listen to the answer.
In Landscape and Memory, Schama argues that myth, like nature, abhors
a vacuum, and so in the absence of surer knowledge, has filled the gaps
in the story of the natural world the way sand fills footprints on a
beach. He takes the reader on a journey from Poland into Lithuania, into
the wilderness (or wildness), into the past. It is as though his task is
not only to collect what can be collected, but also to mourn what has
been lost and to make sense of the lacunae.
It is easy enough to dissect the idea of wildness, to expose the
assumptions it musters. You might argue that one person's wildness is
another person's self-determination, or that wildness is not an issue
unless tameness is spreading, and it finally becomes apparent that the
idea of wildness has been domesticated for political use.
Ecologists and environmental doomsayers have long been denouncing
western civilisation as a terrible destroyer, which lays waste nature
and uproots traditional cultures. Schama declares himself entirely
sympathetic to the philosophy of ''less damage'', but he stands back
from the green commentators who claim that civilisation must find a new
set of creation myths if it is to restore its old harmony with the
natural world.
In his view, the cults of nature that we are so often urged to seek in
unmodernised cultures have been with us for a long time; perhaps for
ever. Landscape and Memory sets out to show the importance to western
culture of such archetypal themes as ''the primitive forest'' the
''river of life'', and the ''sacred mountain''.
Take the woodland, or puszcza, stretching all the way along the
borderland that Poland shares with Belarus and Lithuania. In a
remarkable opening chapter, Schama explains how this ''native realm'' of
writers like Czeslaw Milosz, Tadeusz Konwicki and Adam Mickiewicz came
to represent the struggle for national freedom. But forests mean
different things to different people. Schama shows how in Germany they
have always embodied the militaristic spirit, in France the passion for
order, in England liberty under the greenwood, in America man's
transcendental connection with the Creator.
There are few historians who have made such telling use of art
historical sources as Schama does in this book, though perhaps he casts
his net too wide -- the discussion of Turner is less than satisfactory
-- and hauls in tendencies he disapproves of that aren't peculiarly
involved with the process of myth-making. It is hard to know what to
make of his chapter about Gutzon Borglum and the mountain carving on
Mount Rushmore. According to Schama, this exercise in turning a
landscape into a manscape, or, at any rate, into a presidentscape, was
the inevitable consequence (or corollary) of American white supremacy
which is itself a throwback to Columbus discovering the New World.
Yet nobody knows what Columbus really felt about his discovery, and
most knowledgeable people do not believe that it was a discovery. The
Norse had already been to America and the natives of San Salvador -- who
are called the Taino by modern anthropologists -- were not lost during
the centuries before Columbus arrived.
Even now, the idea of pre-Columbian America has all the imaginative
appeal of the Garden of Eden before the snake began to talk to Eve. It
is a metaphor still full of freshness half a millennium later, the
source of whatever innocence Americans still attribute to themselves.
But the New World was not only an idea or a metaphor, and that is why
the process of myth-making that Schama describes can be harmful.
One might wish that Columbus had come to the Taino the way the
archangel Raphael came to Adam and Eve in Book Five of Paradise Lost,
full of amity and respect, eager to exchange only sober courtesies. One
might (selflessly) wish that Columbus had done what Prospero does at the
end of The Tempest: free his slaves, sink his magic book in the sea, and
return to Europe, leaving the island to its freedom. But, as Schama
observes, we are stuck with the facts, and with the stories we make from
the facts, here in a world that it is hard any longer to call new.

THE Scotch Malt Whisky Society sees itself as a group of individuals
brought together by an interest not in strong drink alone, but also in
Scottish language and culture.
So the society celebrated the first degree course in Scottish language
by offering the Members Room in Leith for an annual lecture.
Liz Lochhead, giving the fourth lecture on Tuesday night, chose to
give us a taste of her personal Scots. Lochhead's work often worries and
chuckles away at the conundrum of identity. Women, yer auntie and
Scotland, all get the treatment.
Her lecture on Tuesday, ''Petticoat Tales, or a personal Odyssey from
the Keelie to the Corbie,'' was a birl round an upbringing in North
Lanarkshire which has a strong imprint on her work.
She didn't realise until a fairly advanced age that her language was
Scots -- or at least a sort of hugger-mugger bilingualism -- it was just
what she spoke: and the words she speaks, her cadences and her emphasis,
come from way back when she was wee enough to coorie doon under the sofa
and nobody noticed.
From behind the sofa she heard the women folk talking of life, death,
discrimination, society and grand emotions. What she heard was gossip.
Women talking their hearts out about what they knew: birth, death; while
the men talked about football.
In her readings of her own work, the characters she most relishes
speak not in the Mither-tongue but in her granny's tongue.
Later she discovered how to moderate, to consider, but was still in
the happy position of growing up in a society where people sang and
recited wondrous, funny, and achingly sad poetry. What you learned in
school was Burns and what you heard in your living room was Bonny Wee
Thing and O' Wert Thou in the Cauld Blast, wither-wringing and with me
for ever.
But Burns was only in January. Later in the year there were the verse
speaking competitions; a glory orgy of saying things out loud and
''plain damn enjoyable''. Lochhead used the occasion as an excuse to
read M C Smith's The Boy on the Train and W D Cocker's The Deluge, which
has the wonderful instruction from the deity to Noah, ''dinna be fashed
aboot fish''. It was plain damn enjoyable.
As Lochhead received her education, the Scots got submerged, and it
was not until many years later that she found herself writing in Scots
-- most notably in her superb Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped
Off, where the corbie most definitely speaks in the accents of her
granny.
From there she progressed to a point where she found herself fed up
trying to put a demarcation on what she would self-consciously call
writing in Scots. Now, she uses Scots in a dramatic and poetic, rather
than strategic or political, way.
It is not used to preserve but to play with and enhance ideas, and
here Lochhead came up with a notion that many of us will recognise. The
language she was taught was proper to use was very male, grown-up,
English and dead, and the language of the Scots renaissance was also
very male, seen through a veil of tobacco and the amber liquid: which is
not to say she did not enjoy it -- it was just that it felt like looking
on from the outside.
Many of us must feel that what Liz Lochhead's work has done for us is
to take us inside, so that we are no longer looking on; that, in the way
she cheerfully disregards demarcation lines and tells it loud for real,
she is speaking our language.
I'd like to believe that you still hear Bonny Wee Thing and O' Wert
Thou in the Cauld Blast in your living-room, but these very songs and
many others of their ilk were the songs my mother learnt as a child from
her mother, and sang to her as she died.
The same songs my mother sang to me and I to my children; and I grew
up with them around me in Glasgow and sang them as I, in turn, held my
dying mother.
My children have not had the privilege of growing up in a society of
choirs, verse speaking and miner's welfare competitions, and have
forgotten the songs. I suspect my experience is not unique and that Liz
Lochhead's work is very important in giving a poetic and public platform
to something so stitched into the fabric of our society that we won't
know we need it until we've lost it.

EVERYTHING seems to be moving rapidly and inexorably to a real mess
and currency punch-up. On one side there is the crumbling dollar which
is apparently causing remarkably little concern either in the White
House or at the Federal Reserve and on the other the hard currencies led
by the yen and German mark which are daily making themselves ever less
competitive.
A major Swiss industrialist, Fritz Fahrni of Sulzer, said earlier this
week it is war between the dollar and the other two with the Swiss franc
a small foot soldier which has followed largely in the footsteps of the
German mark.
There is panic among manufacturers in both Tokyo and Frankfurt,
particularly those with a high dependence upon exports such as the car
manufacturers. They face rapidly falling profits in dollar based
economies, helping drag down domestic economic expansion with the
earlier expectations of a 2% rise in Japanese growth in 1995 now being
rapidly re-calculated to something much lower at perhaps 0.25% if the
dollar maintains its current rate.
The impact of yesterday's Tokyo economic package cannot be really
assessed until foreign exchange markets open properly on Tuesday.
But wait. It it is too easy to be swayed by the apparent high level of
Japanese dependence upon exports. In fact GDP is only 9% reliant upon
external trade and of that only a third depends on what happens in the
US itself.
While there are complaints to the Fed, why should it do anything other
than for internal reasons which are based entirely upon the need to
control US inflation even if the dollar has fallen by over 12% against
the DM in the last six months.
As a country, America is less dependent upon exports than any of the
major economies. In any case their imports are very largely dollar
denominated such as oil and most commodities so the problems of hard
currencies largey by-pass the average citizen.
The biggest concern is that inflation is being pushed ahead because of
increasing capacity contraints -- the US car industry is now beginning
to have problems on that score partly because of its increasingly
successful fightback against Japanese direct imports as well as locally
produced vehicles.
Chrysler's operating margins of 11.5% are about 10 times those of
competitors in Japan.
Again with so much of US trade now with the sickly currencies of
Canada and Mexico, the cheap imports from those two countries play a
part in restraining price increases and account for twice as much
business as does Japan.
Any US rate hike would have a serious impact upon many of the emerging
markets, particularly those on the Pacific Rim with India, Philippines,
South Korea and Thailand all down by over 10% since the beginning of
this year.
Many would be forced to raise their own internal interest rates in
sympathy which would inevitably increase the pressures on local markets
some of which already have rates in excess of 15%.
German manufacturers such as Daimler Benz have called the current DM
rate a catastrophe and can only accelerate the export of production to
cheaper countries such as the Czech Republic and Hungary.
The full impact of the currency imbalance will not be felt for some
time and will be apparent only in the rate at which new orders are being
received.
But the point remains that the dollar has overall held its own in
tradeweighted terms very substantially in recent years, dropping only by
4% since the start of the decade.
If the Fed continues to concentrate purely on US inflation, it places
the burden on those who should bear the reponsibility for their problems
-- in Tokyo and Frankfurt. Any US rate hike would be a bonus and not a
right. In this turmoil, the pound is just a minor participant but whose
fortunes are tied to stronger dollar.

Italy's emperor of style Giorgio Armani, in exclusive conversation
with Anne Simpson, reveals the secret of his success and destroys a few
myths about his lifestyle.
EVEN as a youngster, growing up in the Italian industrial town of
Piacenza, near Milan, Giorgio Armani was remarkably tidy. But his famed
preoccupation with order is not the result of that rather damning
childhood trait. Nor is it the outcome of his military service which was
followed by two years at medical school.
He explains it, instead, as a by-product of fashion pressures: ''To
some extent I am sorry that I did not become a doctor because saving
lives is more important than making clothes. But I changed direction,
and the new job of designing became my entire life.''
This total immersion in his craft has sometimes made Armani seem a
wintry individual, and critics have not been slow to exaggerate his
intellectual sternness, or saddle him with the paranoia of a hermit. But
contrary to reports, it is not true that Armani demands such consuming
loyalty from his employees that they must wear his label at all times.
It is not true either that every item of cutlery in his spartan
kitchen is seal-wrapped, or that he refuses to shake hands, or carry
money. What is clear, however, is that Italy's emperor of style remains
a singularly private person. In each of his four homes he has arranged
space around himself so as to lead a life of pure decision and
thoughtful calculations.
In some ways, then, it is curious to find him working in a sphere
which is all about the fickleness of image -- perishable visions which
he has helped to invent but which have bred a monstrous greed for
constant change.
''It is the media, not the public, which needs such fast shifts of
mood, so designers are no expected to produce a new line every seven
days. I joke, but you know there is a grain of truth.'' Set against the
hectic exhibitionism of so much rowdy fashion, Armani offers a escape
into a seductive chill-out zone. And what we find there, at first glance
anyway, always seems like more of the same; elementally simple clothes
which are sensuous without playing up the folly of striptease.
''The trick is to make you think that nothing has changed,'' he says.
''But I never reproduce a shoulder-line from one season to another, and
I can tell the year of any jacket just by the proportion of the collar.
In terms of style, mine is a very quiet revolution.'' But why is style
important? In this exclusive conversation Giorgio Armani reflects on
this ''expression of the spirit'', on today's lack of role models, the
ballyhoo of the catwalk, and the constant inspiration and brio he draws
from the young:
''Style, in many ways, is the most important signal in our daily lives
because it indicates the condition of the inner self. We must cultivate
it, like a beloved plant, and the younger we start the better.
Otherwise, by the time we are 50, a lack of style will be dramatically
obvious. My heroes, I think, are all the people with style I have met in
my life. This isn't a question of breeding because style originates in
the spirit and therefore it is just as likely to be found among those
with modest lives as well as among sophisticates.
To a great extent, today's lack of role models is because of the
excessive number of people the media offers as potential heroes. The
speed of communication is so fast and pervasive that heroes can be set
up and knocked down in a matter of weeks. So, there is not even
sufficient time to judge their worth or their negative aspects. Thus, we
become immediately infatuated with them, and it takes great strength of
character for us to escape their clutches.
In the old days it was very different. The heroes of my youth were the
legendary Hollywood stars whose fantasy lives we could follow in books
or on screen. Or else they were great statesmen like Churchill, or
adventurers like Lawrence of Arabia. In those days everything conspired
to make us dream about them. Today I still admire a pastmaster of the
cinema, such as Michelangelo Antonioni, a magistrate of the calibre and
tenacity of Antonio Di Pietro, or a scientist like Rita Levi Montalcini.
But we don't consider these people as heroes because their specific
gifts become submerged by the thousands of superficial personalities,
like Claudia Schiffer, who bombard us from the media every day.
Young people have always been divided into clans, and their behaviour
and way of dressing depend on their environment and social context. But
for them there is one universal fashion language and that is jeans.
However it is also my impression that young people today are more
reflective than in the eighties. They are less impressed by consumerism
for its own sake, less susceptible to trends. As a fashion creator I
enjoy designing clothes to suit their way of life rather than designing
just to indulge a whim.
So, young people's views are of paramount importance to me. The
freshness of their observations frequently makes me think again. I
listen to their arguments, their preferences and -- why not? -- their
criticism. If one of my nephews were to say to me: I could never wear
that, I would consider his words carefully. There must be some reason .
. .
I also think there is a reaction against fashion among the wider
public. Those designers who use the catwalks of Paris, New York, London,
and Milan to present a show just for the sake of it may well find
themselves on the front pages of tomorrow's newspapers. But that will be
the end of the matter. These days the market only rewards the realistic,
the practical, the creative idea that works.
As for the world of art generally, I am enthusiastic about almost
everything. From a rock concert to a big exhibition, everything deserves
to be seen and experienced, if only to be able to say: I did not enjoy
it. And where life is concerned, I like the way it flows along and the
urge to keep abreast of it. When we no longer wish to participate
actively in its ups and downs, then we shall know we are growing old. At
60 I have no intention of letting that happen to me just yet.''
JOIN US IN A JOURNEY INTO STYLE
* Next Thursday the hip crowd will boogie on down to The Tramway in
Glasgow to embark on a journey into cool style and funky fun. Next Stop
. . . Emporio Armani is not simply a fashion show: when the models have
ceased their paces and the clothes are back on the hangers, live music
and dancing will begin.
So, come join us, but don't delay in buying a ticket as supplies are
going fast. Held in association with The Herald, this charity event will
feature Emporio Armani's spring and summer collection, worn by leading
Scottish and London models with lots of youthful sassiness and
international attitude.
In a stylish nightclub and chill-out room, both specially created by
Glasgow's Colin Barr of The Lounge, and The Living Room, spritzy
refreshments will be available, and among the entertainers will be
lyrical soul singer Misty Oldland, and Scotland's Lisa Morrish, R&amp;B
specialist and a coming name in hard-edge folk.
Proceeds will go to Scottish European Aid for its work in Bosnia,
Romania and Rwanda, and to The Herald Foundation for Women's Health
which is raising funds for a special one-stop gynaecological clinic at
the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow.
The night will begin at 7.30 and admittance is by numbered ticket
only. The price is #12 a head, and remaining tickets are available from
the following Glasgow venues: Emporio Armani, The Italian Centre; The
Living Room, Byres Road; The Lounge, West Regent Street.

Is it too much to ask that we can have an informed and radical debate
about how land is best used in all our interests? At stake is nothing
less than the prosperity and happiness of the Scottish people, argues.
THE ownership of land in Scotland remains at once one of the most
fascinating, controversial, and least understood aspects of Scottish
cultural and political life.
Scotland does not enjoy the plurality of ownership of land which is
the norm in most west European countries, and has instead one of the
most concentrated patterns of ownership in Europe.
The early development of capitalism, of industrialisation, and of a
relatively stable poltical system run by the titled, the wealthy, and
the landowners, ensured that when the revolutions which rocked most of
Europe in the eighteenth century occurred, and the oppressed peasantry
gained political muscle, the British peasant class were at the full
mercy of powerful political and economic forces which they could not
resist.
The hard-won Crofters Holdings Act of 1886 was an exception which
stands out as one of the few concessions gained by a peasant population
which was much less politically organised and represented than most of
its European counterparts.
Two years before the Crofters Act, in February 1884, the great
American social and land reformer Henry George addressed a large public
meeting in the City Hall in Glasgow.
''Since I have been in Scotland, I have been wondering whether you
haven't got things mixed a little. The Scots are a Bible-reading people.
I have sometimes wondered whether, instead of reading that 'In the
beginning the Lord created the heavens and the earth', they haven't got
it, 'In the beginning the lairds created the heavens and the earth'.
''Certainly the lairds have it all their own way through Scotland.
Theirs is the land and all upon it; theirs is all that is beneath its
surface; theirs are the fish in the rivers and in the lochs; theirs are
the birds of the air; theirs are the salmon in the sea, even the seaweed
that is thrown ashore, even the whales over a certain length, even the
driftwood!
''In Dundee, do you know that the people there, in order to get water,
had to pay #25,000 to the Earl of Airlie for the privilege of drawing
water for their use out of a certain loch? The water alone: he retains
the right to the fish. The very rain as it descends from heaven is the
property of the Laird of Airlie.
''Why just think of it! You know that when the chosen people were
passing through the wilderness they thirsted, and Moses struck a rock
and water gushed forth. What good would it have done if that rock had
been private property and some Earl of Airlie had been there who would
have said, 'You cannot take a cupful until you pay me #25,000'?''
Henry George was a powerful influence on late nineteenth and early
twentieth-century radicals in Britain and the US. His contention that
''the ownership of land is the great fundamental fact which ultimately
determines the social, the political, and consequently the intellectual
and moral condition of a people'' found widespread resonance not just in
rural Scotland, where agrarian unrest was widespread, but also in cities
like Glasgow, where his ideas of equality and social justice coincided
with growing political activism.
In the Highlands, land reformers such as John Murdoch had launched the
radical Highlander newspaper, which played an important role in
politicising crofters. Just a week after George's Glasgow address and in
response to it, the Scottish Land Restoration League was formed, with
Murdoch as its first secretary.
Four years later, in April 1988, Murdoch campaigned on behalf of Keir
Hardie in the mid-Lanark by-election, and a week later chaired the
meeting which gave birth to the Scottish Labour Party. This fusing of
indigenous agrarian unrest with internationalist political developments
was reflected in the alliance of land and labour reformers who came
together in the labour movement.
Throughout the nineteenth century and in the first half of the
twentieth, major land reform Acts affecting crofting, town and country
planning, the coal industry, and land settlement were passed. Despite
these radical measures and other post-war reforms, land ownership and
tenure have almost disappeared from the political agenda.
The Labour Party, despite its auspicious beginnings, has done little
since the immediate post-war years to advance land reform. The
Conservatives, despite being historically (together with the Liberals)
the party of land reform, have done nothing constructive, unless one
counts their major privatisation drive.
Indeed, it could be argued that we are currently experiencing one of
the quietest periods in Scottish land reform history. It is almost, as
one leading commentator put it recently, as if private ownership has
become part of the furniture in Scotland.
This has been accompanied by an increasingly ephemeral treatment of
the subject in the media, with stories often focusing on the more
colourful and bizarre aspects and personalities involved. During the
1970s these focused on Johannes Hellinga and various Dutchmen.
Latterly it has been fashionable to knock various Arabs such as Sheik
Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, Americans such as
John Kluge, the owner of Mar Lodge estate, or Keith Schellenberg, the
unlamented former owner of the Isle of Eigg. That such bizarre
characters exist is undoubtedly important and worthy of comment, but
does little to further constructive land reform beyond prompting
repeated anguish and indignation in the letters columns of the
newspapers.
Repeated calls for a comprehensive and publicly accessible land
register -- as if this would somehow resolve the problem -- are
indicative of the poorly developed state of the debate. While such a
register is of critical importance, it would do little more than rub in
the painful situation all the more clearly.
What has been conspicuous by its absence has been any attempt to
investigate, analyse, and present the economic, social, cultural, and
environmental issues to which land ownership is so central. The result
has been a rather ill-informed debate about land ownership which has
succeeded only in marginalising the participants. Between the politics
of envy and outrage, and the ideological battlefield of the free market
versus central planning, little of lasting value has emerged.
At the root of informed debate must be good-quality, comprehensive
information about the pattern, scale, and nature of landholdings and
their economic, social, environmental, and cultural impacts. We remain
grossly ill-informed about matters that influence the patterns of
investment, availability of land for housing and development, access to
resources, cultural expression, and land-use outcomes.
The fact that hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, fires on oil rigs, and
major chemical contamination by US corporations in the sixties can
reverberate through the Lloyds insurance market, causing land sales by
Lloyds names, is ample evidence, if any is needed, of the fragile and
vulnerable state of the rural economy under current arrangements.
Even public owners such as the Forestry Commission are ambivalent
about any ambitions to play a creative role in rural development. Not
only are forests continuing to be sold to a wide array of investment
concerns, but opportunities for enterprise and integrated management at
the local level are being lost through a highly centralised state body
taking decisions on criteria set in Edinburgh.
At stake is nothing less than the future prosperity, economic and
environmental health, human happiness and political aspirations, of the
Scottish people. Given the colossal weight of the system, however, and
its poorly understood impacts, attempts at reform have tended to founder
on the lack of clearly articulated demands.
What reforms have occurred have been won in response to widely
perceived need and clear political will. With fewer and fewer people
employed directly in the countryside, with free-market capitalism firmly
embedded on the left and right of politics, and with the emergence of
global free markets, land has become a less important part of political
debate.
For those still dependent economically on the land, however, land
ownership has lost none of its relevance. The success of the Assynt
Crofters Trust, the continuing debacle over the Island of Eigg, council
house sales, and the sale of British Coal land, have all contributed to
a more widespread engagement with the issue of land reform. During the
eighties, concepts such as sustainable development and a growing
disillusionment with the role of the state, have put the emphasis on
community based action and grassroots political processes rather than
top down state intervention; and here there are indications of a more
rigorous and informed debate.
At a conference in Beauly last month, crofting representatives met to
discuss the next stage in land reform for crofting areas. Amid renewed
interest by the Labour Party in the land issue and the prospects of a
Scottish parliament, there are clear signs that land ownership and
tenure are climbing up the political agenda.
Ross and Cromarty District Council has sponsored a series of seminars
on the subject, and there is now a biennial lecture in tribute to the
late John McEwan, the author of Who Owns Scotland.
While Sir Hector Monro spelt out the tired establishment line in
Parliament on March 15 that it ''is not the ownership of land that
matters but the way it is managed'', moves are afoot to create land
trusts which, with popular support, can intervene in the land market for
the benefit of local people and the environment.
Such proposals are still to be fully developed and the argument for
land reform being able to transform people's lives is yet to be
demonstrated. A recent study in rural disadvantage found that land
ownership was not a big issue among those interviewed. This is not
surprising. It remains too complex and big an issue for people to grasp
readily, and lies so deep within the economic and political structures
of most people's lives that it takes enormous will to tackle it.
But how we regulate land ownership, what rights and obligations go
with it, and to what extent land could be the basis for public revenue,
are fundamental questions which affect everyone.
Two of the most productive resources in rural areas, for example, are
the seas and the forests. Growing numbers of land reformers are calling
for inshore waters to come under local control; for the Crown Estate to
relinquish its stranglehold over the seabed and for the Forestry
Commission to abandon forest sales and restructure itself to bring
forests under the control of local people, including farmers' and
crofters' co-operatives. Increased active participation by citizens in
planning and housing policy in urban areas could equally revitalise the
quality of life for people in the towns.
At the political level, the SNP have appointed an independent land
commission, headed by Professor Allan MacInnes of Aberdeen University,
to examine all aspects of the land issue in Scotland. The Labour Party
is redefining its ideas of common ownership and community and has the
opportunity to push forward radical and far-reaching proposals which
reach beyond the traditional statist thinking of the left.
Most other developed European democracies understand the land issue
very clearly. They regulate land sales, impose residency requirements,
and have clearly structured, integrated, and more locally accountable
support systems.
Is it too much to ask that we can have an open, informed, mature, and
radical debate about how land is best used in the interests of the
Scottish people? The heady political rhetoric of 100 years ago should
remind us of our continuing failure to address one of the most
fundamental issues of social justice.
The ideas of Henry George and Scottish land reformers such as John
Murdoch are as relevant today in a world of global markets and capital,
where the stresses and injustices are as profound as those of
nineteenth-century industrial Scotland. It remains to be seen whether we
are mature enough politically to see the issues for what they are,
rather than as a crutch upon which to rest outdated prejudices.

ownership of land in Scotland since the work of John McEwan. He can be

HIGH-security checkpoints and sprawling modern buildings bring to mind
Ministry of Defence facilities but the same is true of Glaxo Wellcome's
new Medicines Research Centre which looms large on the horizon of
Stevenage in Hertfordshire.
This is the brave new world of science where external landscape
features, internal art and the layout of the site has been designed
specifically to encourage scientists to be as creative as possible.
There are state-of-the-art laboratories, no desk-top bunsen burners
and flaky asbestos mats here. A chemical pilot plant has been built at a
cost of #100m to test new compounds before large-scale manufacture at
sites such as Montrose.
Glaxo's senior management hopes that scientists of various disciplines
will interact in ''nodes'', which are links between labs. They are also
encouraged to keep up to date with the latest scientific thinking with
access to fellow scientists worldwide through the Internet and an
extensive on-site library.
Facilities have been laid on so that if necessary people can remain on
the site for 24 hours. There is no smoking, no unauthorised photography
and no noise, just the quiet buzz of computers monitoring a variety of
processes.
Throughout the 1990s, Glaxo has been spending several hundred million
pounds on research and development. In 1995 it expects to spend around
#900m.
At a cost of #700m, the Medicines Research Centre, which covers 35
hectares, is the UK's largest single investment in science and a major
showcase for British science.
The Queen is officially opening the centre next week, which employs
1500 scientists and support staff. The scientists include synthetic
organic chemists, pharmacologists, microbiologists and cellular and
molecular biologists.
The Medicines Research Centre is one weapon in Glaxo's armoury which
it hopes will enable it to stay ahead of the opposition in what are
expected to remain extremely competitive markets. As governments across
the industrialised world seek to cap their soaraway healthcare budgets
there is intense pressure on drug company margins.
Increases in productivity are vital if profits growth is to be
achieved going forward. Companies who produce truly innovative drugs
that address currently unmet medical needs such as Alzheimers, cancer,
diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, will be better able to resist price
pressures and command premium prices for their drugs.
Pricing pressures together with shorter exclusivity periods as patents
become shorter means that if companies are to succeed they need to
dramatically raise their productivity. In general terms, for every #200m
invested in research and development, only one product is likely to
emerge on the market.
Once identified, the development and regulatory approval of a product
can take up to 10 years. In the past research scientists were expected
to come up with one novel product a year but such a luxury can no longer
be afforded and three or four will be required.
Increasing productivity remains a key objective of Glaxo not least
because its sales growth is slowing down along with earnings per share.
It should be helped in this goal by the extensive automation on site at
the new Medicines Research Centre including sophisticated robotics which
has already raised productivity by 25 times in just six months.
Today's drug discovery projects use scientific disciplines that simply
did not exist when many of our most familiar medicines were developed.
Historically, drugs have been discovered empirically with a small
molecule being identified which had particular properties which were
then used to create a new medicine.
In recent times a much more mechanistic approach to drug discovery has
developed to cope with the task of finding drugs that will treat more
complex illnesses. Computer-aided design and the application of human
genetics are expected to play an increasing role in drug discovery.
The use of genetic techniques is enabling scientists to gain real
insights into the causes of disease. This has already occurred with
Cystic Fibrosis, breast cancer and Alzheimers.
The acquisition of Affymax in California and Wellcome in the UK was
also part of the strategy of boosting productivity. Wellcome has
technologies in areas new to Glaxo such as genetics and virology whereas
Affymax, located close to Silicon Valley in California, uses leading
edge technology in a new discipline known as combinatorial chemistry, to
combine thousands of chemical entities which may lead to the discovery
of future new drugs.
Glaxo has a wide-ranging R&amp;D programme. The main therapeutic areas
Glaxo is interested in are gastro-intestinal, anti-emesis,
anti-migraine, respiratory, systemic antibiotics, dermatologicals and
cardiovascular.
Following its takeover of Wellcome, Glaxo has become the world's
largest prescription medicine company although it has just 5% market
share. Advances in technology such as genetics, molecular modelling and
robotics provide huge opportunities for faster discovery of truly
innovative drugs.
Although it will take time for the full benefits of its three-pronged
productivity attack -- the Medicines Research Centre, Affymax and
Wellcome -- to come through Glaxo appears well placed to remain close to
if not at the top of the world pharmaceutical league.

'THAT column you did last week was sexist'', she shouted. I was caught
unawares, as my columns have so far been most notable for their
inability to excite any anger (or interest)! I can't remember exactly
what it was that she took offence at, but I was struck by the certainty
of her assertion.
What had upset her was some remark I had made about how women think
differently from men. My political correctness credentials were then
called into question with a vengeance, which didn't bother me too much,
as I'm not too keen on PC as a concept anyway.
Proponents of PC contest that its main effect is to stop people making
derogatory references to minorities, thereby avoiding the reinforcement
of society's inbuilt prejudices. My parents taught me in a similar
system, but then it was only ever called ''good manners'', and that had
much the same effect, but with less reliance on Germaine Greer.
PC is supposedly a remarkably consistent judge of behaviour. If a man
addresses his female colleagues with ''Hi girls'', then you could infer
that he has a problem dealing with women as equals, and that he is
reinforcing the white phallocracy that dominates all Western society and
subjugates the rights of minorities. If the same man addresses his male
colleagues by saying ''Hi boys'', then he is including himself as part
of their peer group, and is helping to reinforce the white phallocracy
etc etc. You get the picture. If PC has any consistency, it's only in
its insistence that all males are intrinsically evil.
During a recent 'plane trip, I read a report of some very eminent
''physical anthropologists'' (Anthropologist. Greek word meaning
''social worker''. Physical. Latin word meaning ''pretentious job
title'') being booed off stage at a scientific conference.
These guys, who obviously had brains the size of a plumber's bill, had
committed an equally heinous crime in stating that they felt male
sexuality and female sexuality were different. These differences have
evolved because of the massive size of man's brain. (In that last
sentence, for ''man'', read ''homo sapiens''.)
Apparently brain is, in energy terms, a very demanding tissue; even
while watching The Word, it uses more energy per ounce than muscle. Bear
with me, this is important. Since the human brain is proportionately the
largest in the world, the physical feeding of this huge amount of tissue
has necessitated a few alterations in our behaviour patterns.
There are loads of things about the brain that we don't know. For
example we can account only for the function of 10% of the human brain.
It may not be surprising to hear that, for example, 90% of Jim
Davidson's brain is unused, but it's a bit disconcerting when you think
that the same is true of those who perform important tasks, like barmen.
If there's that much spare brain, then personally I don't know why we
can't put a small area in charge of remembering where the TV remote
control is. Many people, admittedly most of them New Age wierdos, wonder
if the majority of our brain is just sitting there being wrinkled and
waiting to do exotic, magical things.
This concept likens the brain to that food mixer you got as a wedding
present. Could it be used for some bizarre functions? (The brain, not
the food mixer. Well, then again . . .) Telekinesis (moving an object
with the power of thought) is one possibility, as is telepathy
(communicating with no physical contact allowed. Or is that marriage?
Hmm).
Most of the brain is a mystery, and the way it differs between the
sexes is just as mysterious. Recent scans (honest, this next bit is
true) have shown that while chatting to a member of the opposite sex,
two areas of a woman's brain are active.
The first active bit is the area responsible for processing incoming
conversation, and forming lucid comments in reply. The second area is
the bit that's working out what she's going to make for tonight's
dinner. Using the same scans, under the same conditions, men have only
one area that shows up as being active; the one that neurologists term
the ''I'll bet she fancies me rotten'' area.
This area is positioned just next to the ''Useless Sporting Facts''
region of the frontal lobe, both parts being grossly overdeveloped in
all post-pubertal males, and vestigial in women.
But, back at the conference, the anthropologists argued that women's
brains function less well during pregnancy and breastfeeding in order to
allow more energy to be devoted to developing their baby's central
nervous system. Those champions of PC felt that this statement was a
reinforcement of the white phallocracy that dominates all Western
society etc, etc. I've asked my wife, and she agrees with the boffins,
thankfully.
I would like to comment on my own personal experience, but if my
collars are a bit creased for the next few weeks, I hope that you'll
understand. I have very little male ego, and I can handle the fact that
my wife is smarter than me. In any exams we sat together, she always
done better (except for English). As a truly well-balanced male I could,
and still can, cope easily with this mental superiority. I was a bit
worried when, after leaving work to look after the children, she dropped
her IQ sufficiently to enjoy watching all the Australian soaps twice a
day.
Her idea of challenging television was Richard and Judy. When your
previously bright wife volunteers that she can't read any newspaper
article longer than a birth announcement, then something serious has
happened. She reckons that this is a temporary ''deterioration'' in her
mental powers, and for her sake I hope so.
The anthropologists' claim that with all the energy being devoted to
the development of the offspring's brain function, there's nothing left
for the mother's brain to work with seems reasonable. They're not quite
right though. I can now vouch for the fact that mothers process an
enormous amount of information but most of it is useless to those who
are not mothers.
My wife might not be too hot on nuclear physics, but she's great at
knowing that if it's Friday, then it's ''Y'' bird day on Playbus. Maybe
she can't tell you the name of the Prime Minister of New Zealand, but
she can remember that the Paddington Bear pyjamas are stuffed inside the
Mickey Mouse wellies. The reason she holds on to these facts is that
this type of information helps avert childish tantrums in a way that a
full description of the current Bosnian crisis will never do. They don't
know less, they're just smart enough to know different.
That's enough, I've got to go and iron my Paddington Bear pyjamas.

Tokyo,
JAPAN's promised package to combat the surging strength of its
currency has failed to impress the Tokyo stock market and scarcely
budged the yen/dollar parity in trading here yesterday.
A 0.75% cut takes the Bank of Japan's official discount rate to an
unprecedented low of 1%. And the package of emergency measures thrashed
out earlier by the ruling coalition promises faster deregulation and
action to increase imports into Japan thus cutting the country's massive
trade surplus.
It also urges Japanese companies to carry out more yen-based business.
At present only 40% of Japanese exports and 20% of imports are
denominated in yen.
But Tokyo markets and currency markets here and elsewhere have given
both measures a firm thumbs down. The Nikkei, after four successive days
of rises, was down more than 390 points and the dollar strengthened by
only one third of a yen in late trading to 83.58.
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama claimed every conceivable measure was
contained in the package and predicted the yen's rise would be halted as
a result. But outside the Diet and the government bureaucracy, few here
seem to believe him.
Most peoples' eyes are firmly fixed on a prediction by the Aum
Shinrinkyo cult that some terrible event will strike Tokyo today The
cult is already under suspicion for the subway gas attack which killed
11 people on March 20. The focus of local news bulletins is on massive
police action to round up cult followers and protect sensitive locations
in advance of the threat's deadline.
Markets have been left to focus on what the yen support package left
out. There are no firm targets or any firm timetable for cutting the
trade surplus. And a proposal to cut taxes on securities transactions
was also abandoned, a move which did not please the markets.
Some other measures, like the bond issue to help fund reconstruction
of the Kobe area after the earthquake were well trailed in advance.
Labour unions are unhappy at the prospect of more of their members'
jobs being shipped overseas as the major Japanese exporting corporations
try to adjust to the yen's surge. For example, there are reports that
JVC is shifting production of video tapes from Japan to Madras in South
India.
The package is also emerging at a time when the entire political
process is held in very low regard by a public which, last Sunday,
elected two complete outsiders as the new governors of Tokyo and Osaka.
And it coincides with an escalation in the war of words with the US over
alleged Japanese trade restrictions on cars and autoparts.
Washington is threatening punitive tariffs and an appeal to the new
World Trade Organisation (WTO) over what it sees as Japan's
determination to keep its domestic market virtually closed to
American-made cars and parts.
Tokyo's bureaucrats argue that the yen's strength is, in reality, the
weakness of the dollar and they urge the Clinton administration to do
more to cut both the US budget and trade deficits but Washington points
out that some 60% of the US's $66bn trade deficit with Japan is
accounted for by cars and car parts.
Only some 45,000 of the six million vehicles sold in Japan last year
were imported from the US. And the Japanese system of car checks favours
home sourced parts rather than imported ones.
The row, which has been simmering for two years, is similar in some
respects to the dispute between Tokyo and the European Union over
discriminatory taxation against mimported sports like Scotch, in favour
of shochu, a popular local distilled spirit which, in one of its two
forms, is virtually indistinguishable from vodka.
The Scotch Whisky Association argues that, despite a GATT ruling
against Japan in 1987, the tax on imported whisky and brandy -- and
domestically produced Japanese whisky, too -- continues to run at
between four and six times the rate non shochu.
EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan announced last week he is
considering seeking a new ruling from the WTO on the issue. Finance
Ministry officials I've spoken to here appear quite determined to defend
the present tax differential, to protect shochu producers and avoid
politically unpopular further price rises in a drink which now accounts
for 70% of the spirits market in Japan.
But if Japan is serious about cutting its massive trade surplus with
the rest of the world, it is hard to see how it can logically continue
to argue against these two specific cases of import discrimination.
The fact that Tokyo continues to dispute them underlines the market's
initial reaction to Japan's emergency package -- that it is not a
whole-hearted attempt to halt the yen's inexorable rise.
There is speculation here that the yen/dollar rate could soon be
testing a dramatic new floor of 70 yen to the dollar.

THE voice was querulous with age and thick with distaste. ''These
politicians and their sexual piccadillys, I mean, my goodness!''
''I think you mean peccadillos,'' said the chat-show host.
''I do! I do!'' squeaked the voice.
He was the eighth caller to ring in that morning about the latest
political sex scandal. Just in front of the woman with the irritating
salival click in her voice that whispery housewives from middle England
tend to develop, and behind the man who said he'd only buy a paper if it
carried a story about a royal, a battalion of soldiers, and the
regimental goat.
There was lots of talk about morality and
heavens-who-cares-what-they-get-up-to-in-their-own-beds, but for all the
tangle of indignation and feigned disinterest, there was no concealing
the fact they were all utterly fascinated by the topic. No, not
fascinated. Fixated.
Them and us and by us I mean you. Yes, you. Outraged From High
Suburbia with your slip-on shoes and welded-on propriety. You pretend to
read about policies and issues and other weighty matters but your eyes
will wander to the front page of the tabloids where another MP has been
caught with his stockings on. You'll say it's a piece of nonsense all
the fuss about the Chelsea strip and the foot fetish, but you probably
know all the details.
It's a peculiarly British affliction, this furtive obsession-repulsion
with sex, the I'm-not-a-prude-but syndrome. Yes we are -- one of the
most prudish, puerile nations on earth. The country that considered the
leering, groping Benny Hill a cultural treasure; the place that has the
highest Baywatch ratings behind Mongolia; the nation where the most
complained-about adverts of the year show Claire Rayner flinging around
pads with wings, and a nipple peeping through a bottle of shower gel.
Sex doesn't have to involve a politician or a personality to be
endlessly fascinating for the British, although it helps to have the
added frisson of feeling you kind of know the person involved.
We also want to know about the little people, the ones at the suburban
partner-swapping parties which make the inside pages of the Sunday
tabloids.
We'll tut and we'll frown but we'll flick through the pages and the
message will be passed on to the next generation as it was passed to
ours. Carry On films are fun but sex isn't. It's naughty, naughty,
naughty, and I'd really rather not admit that you're a product of it.
You're right. It's not funny. It's not funny that the UK and,
particularly Scotland, has one of the worst teenage pregnancy rates in
the world. It's not funny that it took a Dutch doctor to warn Scotland
that hang-ups about sexuality were hurting the younger generation. It's
not funny the Family Planning Association has had to appeal to parents
to teach sex education to their offspring.
Want to know what sex means in the UK at the moment kids? Look up the
dictionary. You'll find it after romp and before snigger. If you need to
learn about adult bodies scan the underwear section of mum's Kay's
catalogue or get your hands on that magazine doing the rounds in school.
Try the Internet if all else fails.
In Holland, where the teenage pregnancy rate is one of the lowest in
the world, children learn about sex from nursery. In Sweden and Norway
they're taught it's for procreation and recreation. It can be fun, it
can be deadly, and here's what you need to know to achieve one and avoid
the other.
If we can't learn to demystify sex, the tabloids will continue to
titillate and we'll remain the smutty postcard characters of Europe,
red-faced and ogling. Like the old lady in the urban myth who calls
police to her home to complain about a flasher in the flat opposite.
Watching from her bathroom they see a naked man emerge from his own
shower. The old lady immediately hoists herself on to a stool, peers
over, and spits out: ''Look at that. It's disgusting.''
And it's not just human sex we pretend we can't stomach. The animal
kingdom is fair game when it comes to British prurience, even for Noel
Coward, who, come to think of it, knew a thing or two about piccadillys.
Taking a walk through London with a friend and the friend's small son,
he came across two dogs going at it with gusto in the middle of the
pavement near a school for the visually impaired.
''What are they doing?'' asked the boy.
''Well,'' explained Coward, after a moment's hesitation. ''The one in
front has gone blind and the one behind is pushing it to St Dunston's.''

POETRY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR: AN INTERNATIONAL ANTHOLOGY
edited by Desmond Graham
Chatto and Windus, #18.99
FROM a poetic, as well as a historical, point of view the First World
War was a Great War for England. Many English poets rose imaginatively
before they fell physically to the occasion. Rupert Brooke immortalised
the English soldier in five sonnets and was himself immortalised in an
obituary Churchill contributed to The Times of April 26, 1915: ''He
expected to die; he was willing to die for the dear England whose beauty
and majesty he knew.'' The bloody business of war was approached with
pleasure in Brooke's purple poetry and Churchill's purple prose.
If war was verbal heaven for Brooke and Churchill, it was mental hell
for Wilfred Owen who, after fighting at the Somme in 1917, was sent to
Craiglockhart War Hospital for neurasthenics. At Craiglockhart Owen met
his mentor Siegfried Sassoon, then returned to the front to die and live
through the Sassoonish poems he left behind him. For Brooke and Owen the
Great War was the greatest thing that had ever happened. They were war
poets, defined by an experience they found inspirational for better or
worse.
The Second World War was second best for English poets around at the
time. Brooke and Owen had offered answers about the inhuman nature of
war so a crucial question had to be asked in their absence. ''Where are
the war poets?'' asked C Day Lewis in 1943 in a poem that saw ''No
subject for immortal verse''. English poetry had no need for a new war
poet as it had a grand old warrior alive and well and living in London
and composing war speeches in poetic style.
Churchill's famous speech of June 4, 1940, in the House of Commons
spoke more poetically than most slim volumes. See it as verse and you
will see what I mean: ''We shall fight on the beaches,/We shall fight on
the landing grounds,/ We shall fight in the fields and in the
streets,/We shall fight in the hills,/We shall never surrender.''
Churchill, with his romantic rhetoric and rhythm, was the Rupert Brooke
of the Second World War and professional English poets could not match
his warrior mentality and triumphal tone.
As for the anti-war attitude, it had been eloquently expressed before
and English poets of the Second World War could not compete with the
pacifist pugnacity of Sassoon or Owen's loving embrace of the enemy.
Having no urgent message to deliver, English poets of the Second World
War wrote curiously relaxed and dispassionate poetry.
Henry Reed's Naming of Parts accepts the tedium of training for war.
As soldiers are told what to do with their rifles, one takes poetic
licence with his weapon: ''we call this/Easing the spring. And rapidly
backwards and forwards/The early bees are assaulting and fumbling the
flowers;/They call it easing the Spring.'' Whereas Brooke felt his war
was a brave crusade, Reed felt his was a boring curse. Before he was
killed in Normandy in 1944, Keith Douglas wrote peaceful poems about
war. How to Kill opens on an image of a child playing with a ball then
moves calmly to the spectacle of a soldier with another soldier in his
sights. Thinking of the man he has killed, the surviving soldier
reflects: ''I am amused/to see the centre of love diffused/and the waves
of love travel into vacancy./How easy it is to make a ghost.'' Whereas
Sassoon and Owen were angry about the First World War, Douglas could
write as a man amused by the Second.
In general, then, English poetry had exhausted itself on the subject
of world war by the time the Second came around, so particularly fine
poets, like Douglas, rejected the patriotic fervour of Brooke and
refused to repeat the furious warnings of Sassoon and Owen. Desmond
Graham, author of an impressive biography of Douglas, describes his hero
as ''probably the finest British poet'' of the Second World War but
acknowledges the paucity of English war poetry of the period by going
easy on Douglas and other English poets and going outside England for
energetic expressions of emotion.
He finds one Scottish poet fighting mad at the indifference of
official England to the fate of a fighting man. A poem called Heroes, by
Sorley MacLean, remembers an English soldier who fought and fell only to
be forgotten by the country that raised him: ''No cross or medal was put
to his/chest or to his name or to his family . . . I saw a great warrior
of England,/a poor manikin on whom no eye would rest.'' Other Scots,
such as Robert Garioch and Hamish Henderson, also stressed the
sufferings of the common man a world away from official English ideas of
heroism.
The First World War was, according to the finest war poets of the
period, all about all-conquering England but the Second explored areas
beyond Brooke's ''foreign field/That is forever England''. Nobuyuki Saga
wrote about Hiroshima: ''people vaporized instantly/are walking in
mid-air''. Janos Pilinsky about Ravensbruck: ''The prison garb, the
convict's skull/blink like a projection.'' Czeslaw Milosz about the
Warsaw Ghetto: ''Breaking of glass, wood, copper, nickel, silver.''
Eugen Jebeleanu about Lidice: ''My fingers found the tears in my
eyes,/but I did not want to cry.''
Graham's ambitious anthology offers poems from more than 20 countries
to show how the Second World War involved a larger literary community
than that associated with little England where the most telling poetry
was in the prose written and spoken by a Prime Minister with a voice
from the past.

Straight-talking Rena Owen tells Ian Pryor how it is about her career
and the impact of her latest film
ON screen and off, Rena Owen doesn't mince words. The 34-year-old
Maori actor spent much of last year picking up awards around the globe
for Once Were Warriors, the rollercoaster ride of a drama that is
helping make her name. Owen's gutsy portrayal of long-battling,
long-suffering wife Beth Heke allows her the scope for the kind of
powerhouse performance that has audiences grimacing one minute, and
silently cheering her on the next.
''I'm very happy and content with where I'm at,'' says the
refreshingly straight-talking actor. ''And God what's so satisfying
about it is I've worked so hard to get there. When I got the part of
Beth I thought, 'I've bloody earned this role'. All those years I did
theatre I wasn't getting paid . . .''
Owen has every reason to sound satisfied. Back in New Zealand Once
Were Warriors has gone on to become the most successful film in the
country's history. Its powerful story of domestic violence and alcohol
as they affect an Auckland family caused a noticeable increase in
enquiries at women's refuges and anger-management courses across the
country.
Says Owen: ''It's highly satisfying to be not only in a successful
film, but also one that's had a very deep effect on people's lives.''
Whether Warriors will have similar impact overseas is still open to
question. After impressive showings in Australia and Italy, there is
hope it could crossover and become an international hit. It has already
won a number of awards at film festivals around the globe; and in
Montreal, where it was voted audience favourite, Owen beat out Jennifer
Jason Leigh to take the best-actress prize.
Owen has made the point in a number of interviews that the family
portrayed in Warriors could have come from any number of cities on the
planet. ''The film shows what can happen to a warrior race that has been
colonised,'' she says. ''That's the undercurrent of this film -- it's in
the title. They're seen as a very wounded people. But you'd have to be
pretty dumb to think that all Maori people are like that. Most countries
just project the pretty pictures. Not many project the underbelly,
''their ugly underside''.
Bringing this portrait of poverty and alcohol-plagued family life to
the screen was clearly no picnic. ''I remember one week we did the
beating-up scene one day, the next I did the suicide scene, the next it
was on the Marae (the Maori word for ancestral home),'' she says. ''It
was gruelling . . . but probably the best way to do it. I could use the
exhaustion to feel and look haggard.''
Hollywood clearly doesn't agree. In between all of the festival
jetsetting, Owen found time last year to fly to Los Angeles and audition
for projects with Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro. Though feedback was
positive, she is not holding her breath for a phone call -- one part was
Japanese, the other for a black.
Proudly Maori -- ''it's part of your heart, part of your soul'' -- she
counts her looks a mixed blessing. ''It's an advantage internationally,
but not often an advantage in New Zealand,'' she says. ''There I'd only
get looked at if it said a Maori role. I'd go in and they'd say, ''Oh no
you're far too European-looking. So I'd go for a European role -- 'Oh no
you're far too Maori-looking'. . .''
It was such thinking, she says, that cost her a part in Jane Campion's
The Piano -- though after seeing the finished film she is not sorry at
having missed out. ''The Maori weren't integral. It was like looking at
an old Western where you had the Indians in the background with bows and
arrows. Jane's intentions were always good. But ultimately the only
function they had was to carry the piano.''
Like the stars of that film, Owen is no stranger to crossing oceans.
She spent most of the eighties living in London, and says it will always
feel like a second home. It was here that Owen learned to act, got her
first lucky break in Inside Out -- the touring play about women in
prison -- and wrote and toured her first play: Te Awa I Tahutu (The
River that Ran Away), ''about a young Maori girl reclaiming her
heritage''.
Her first taste of movies came after she returned to New Zealand, with
a small role in Kevin Costner's Easter Island epic Rapa Nui. ''It's a
terrible movie,'' Owen says succinctly, before adding that she is glad
of the experience of making it. Bad weather meant that her original
two-month contract finally stretched to five. ''I think the Americans
didn't realise that you can't buy the sun. Any company that shoots an
exterior film in the most rainy season of the year has got to be a bit
mad . . .''
''Too long in the tooth'' to want to rush off to Hollywood for no
reasons, these days Owen is more interested in finding a good script. In
her next film, You're My Venus, from up-and-coming Kiwi director Stewart
Main (Desperate Remedies) she is set to play a transvestite who becomes
a transexual in order to improve romance and career. ''It's a
wonderfully wild, fantastically risky script to do.''
Owen herself is a bit more of a traditionalist. Part of an 11-strong
family, she dreams of one day marrying and having babies of her own.
''Outside of acting, children are my next greatest passion.''

YET another gruelling decline in support for the Scottish
Conservatives in the polls.
Would they, in your opinion, now be wise to distance themselves from
Central Office in London by introducing distinctively new conservative
policies more attuned to Scottish public opinion on water, education,
health, and, of course, Home Rule?
I understand why Conservatives in London favour Unionism, but are
Scottish Conservatives wise to ignore democracy?
It is their and our risk that because of this blind spot, there will
hardly anyone in a Scottish parliament, if it comes, to represent
ordinary conservative values.
That would be an imbalance and a weakness in the new body, resulting
from unwise addiction by the Scottish Conservatives to imported dogma.
Do you agree?

REGARDING your article about the abyss facing the Scottish
Conservative Party, I was extremely disappointed to discover that The
Herald is still pursuing an apocalyptic policy towards the Conservative
Party in Scotland (April 10).
With up to two years before the next General Election, I find it
disappointing that you are predicting ''certain'' defeat for Mr Lang, Mr
Walker, Mr Forsyth, and Mr Gallie.
May I remind you that a few days before the 1992 General Election you
predicted that the Scottish Conservatives would hold only three seats?
The actual result was that the Conservatives gained two seats and lost
none. Indeed their share of the vote increased in eight out of the nine
seats that they held at that time.
I am saddened that The Herald has still not learned its lesson about
predicting results for the Scottish Conservative Party.

OF COURSE, although it is very painful for lefties like me to admit
it, the very perceptive Michael Fry's description of present-day Scots
as whingers has at least a grain of truth in it (April 12).
But why does he restrict himself to the Scots? Over a decade ago, when
it was still permissible to speak and write about the Great British
Left, the late E P Thompson, the English historian, responded to the
Fry-like taunt that the English Left was bloody-minded by making the
simple point that they had always had so much to oppose.
But, in denouncing the seemingly genetically leftist Scots and by
attempting to ape Jack McLean as The Herald's intellectual provocative
agent, the English historian Fry is not just inferior to McLean. He is
also very inferior to such of his English, though rather more radical,
predecessors as John Wilkes, William Cobbett, Jack Wade, and Richard
Carlile.
In making the same complaints about the Scots in the eighteenth
century, Wilkes described us in the North Briton as ''Jacobites and
foreigners'' and ''the Very Bastards of Creation''. I challenge Fry to
top that.
What is most astonishing of all is that Fry has not read -- or perhaps
just does not understand -- such early twentieth-century English
historians as A and E G Porritt. In their massive two-volume history,
The Unreformed House of Commons (1903), they wrote about the glories of
Scotland before the Union of 1707, including ''the excellent system of
poor relief'', the ''effective remedy against the evils of arbitrary or
illegal imprisonment'', ''the universal system of public instruction'',
and the rights of the poor under the Scottish legal system.
On the evidence of such Establishment historians as the Porritts, the
Scots did not, in Fry's phrase, revel in ''the role of the eternal
victim'' before 1707. Nor were they before that seminal year, in a now
well-known phrase, 90-minute patriots.
For someone with Fry's historical knowledge and journalistic nous to
write about the Massacre of Glencoe as ''an attempt to create a
Tory-free zone'' is rather insensitive and plain silly. It is also
somewhat surprising that he un-historically insists on equating
Labourism with democratic, humanistic socialism.
However, as an unrepentant leftist, I was very pleased to read his
defence of the dirt-cheap wages being paid to working folk. Fry is at
least honest -- a diminishing human quality in so many modern Tories who
reside furth of Scotland.
Perhaps our collective whinging is not really genetic at all. And, if
it is, as I'd like to believe, environmental, there is hope that Michael
Fry will, in the fullness of time, become one of us. Where else could he
go, anyway?

''We are the people of England, that have never spoken yet,'' G K
Chesterton once memorably wrote of his countrymen; and everyone who has
ever made a stab at describing some common denominator of
''Englishness'' must have a vague sense of the quality of slow-to-rouse
reticence to which he refers.
All the same, I'm beginning to feel a kind of end-of-century fever of
impatience to know what the English, jointly and severally, are making
of the peculiar slow paroxysm into which their politics seems to be
sliding.
Some of the cultural signals emerging from the British establisment --
Michael Portillo, John Major, Teddy Taylor -- are becoming so odd that
knowing what the average English punter thinks of them begins to seem
like a matter of urgency.
The other day, for instance, I found myself listening over lunch to an
impeccable Radio 4 adaptation of one of Saki's Clovis stories -- a set
of beguiling shaggy-dog tales about the eccentric behaviour of the
Bertie Woosterish upper classes in the years between the wars -- and
found myself seized with a curious mixture of exasperation, nostalgia,
and outright anxiety about the way in which British mainstream culture
seems to become more and more fixated on the past, and in particular on
the imperial high noon between, say, 1850 and 1940.
What is striking about these Clovis stories is their perfect, poised
assumption that the behaviour of this tiny echelon of English society is
somehow central to human culture; to be regarded as normal and
interesting even by people whose real lives bore absolutely no relation
to the world the author describes.
Much as working class kids in the west of Scotland, in my youth, were
expected to read abstruse children's books about English public school
life and identify with them, thereby dismissing their own life and
experience as some kind of unfortunate aberration.
WHAT is clear to me is that for an entire swathe of influential middle
class people in Britain -- those who were genuinely born into that
establishment culture, or who exerted themselves to become part of it --
the future-shock of postwar cultural change that removed that little
slice of Britishness from its central position in the world's affairs,
has simply been too great.
The shift, within a couple of generations, from absolute confidence
and power and a world map all coloured red, to something close to
complete irrelevance and marginalisation, has driven them half mad.
They sit around like Miss Haversham in her wedding dress, crazed with
longing for an irretrievable past, sick with nostalgia, drenched in a
Merchant-Ivory haze of colonial reminiscence, purple with rage at the
thought of the European Union encroaching on the sovereignty of the
imperial isle, and -- most significantly for radio -- frothing at the
mouth every time Radio 4, their network of choice, departs from a
cultural agenda driven by a Miss Marple image of England circa 1927.
Of course, Radio 4 often fights back against that agenda. But
listening to pre-war leftovers like the Clovis stories -- or other
symptoms of middle England's introverted pre-industrial dreamworld, like
this week's unbearable holiday quiz about The Archers -- I sometimes
begin to feel a desperate need to know just how many of the people of
England long for a past that can never return.
What proportion of them have been driven barking mad by the sudden
loss of empire; and will they need a century or two of intensive
cultural care to recover?
And how many, by contrast, are psychologically able to shake the dust
from their feet and look to some kind of imaginable future, in Britain,
Europe, the world? For this is information that we Scots need in order
to make sensible decisions about our own future; and for the life of me,
as I listen to the schizoid outpourings of Britain's national radio
networks now, I can't work out where the truth lies.

SINCE Sir Charles Mackerras's Bach can be as brisk as his Beethoven,
nobody should have expected his Good Friday performance of the St
Matthew Passion to be a study in prolonged lugubrious contemplation. It
was first and foremost a drama, often quite operatic in its atmosphere
and interplay of solo voices, yet with the work's ritualistic,
ceremonial aspects not suppressed.
From the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and SCO Chorus (augmented by the
young choristers of St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh, where the
performance will be repeated tonight) he drew sombre, abrasive, often
pungent timbres, alive to the progress of the action, yet without
obtrusive theatricality. The thunder and lightning chorus in Part One
was, if anything, underplayed, but for the very good reason that Sir
Charles's was a gradual yet inexorable intensification of Bach's vast
musical fresco, sometimes rough-edged and grainy in tone, but also
greatly eloquent.
This was not the St Matthew Passion as a profound religious experience
but as a timeless drama of duplicity and betrayal, cruelty and pain,
guilt and suffering, with the Evangelist's and Jesus's recitatives
voiced by John Mark Ainsley and Simon Keenlyside with exceptional
feeling, and enunciated (in German) with high clarity, Ainsley's
delicate top notes a particular pleasure.
As a distinguished opera conductor, Sir Charles gave Joan Rodgers,
Patricia Bardon, Ian Bostridge, and David Wilson-Johnson (and their
accompanying obbligato instrumentalists) wonderful scope to express
themselves in the solo arias.

WHILE he might be American, he certainly isn't new: opening act Marty
Stuart, a veteran of solo tours and stints in Johnny Cash's band, is
very much part of the mainstream country establishment. His songs, Now
That's Country and Hillbilly Blues, the spangly jackets, the pedal
steel, the cross stage shuffles, and the guitar solos mark country at
its ploddingly professional worst.
Ironically, second up Trisha Yearwood, very much the new kid in town
on this package, has won the hearts of the traditional country audience
in the US with very few ingredients from the above recipe.
Although an uncomfortable figure on stage, her soaring voice makes her
a great interpreter of other writers' work and a brilliant ballad
singer.
Emmylou Harris, a more accomplished and experienced performer, makes
no apologies for playing her ''old American music''.
Her voice retains every bit of its gut-wrenching poignancy, no more so
than on the opening Ooo Las Vegas, while reunited with members of the
Hot Band, who she first toured with 20 years ago, she has a wonderfully
sensitive, never overstated backdrop to her voice.
The New American Music Tour may have mistakenly placed the emphasis on
the new, but it did make for a good cross-section of contemporary
country.

DO I understand that Michael Fry is suggesting that the Duke of
Sutherland was indulging in social engineering when he cleared the
people from his land, and ''dumped'' them (Michael Fry's word) on rocky
foreshores where nothing would grow? (April 12).
How quaint that to cure intolerable conditions the duke instructed his
agent, Patrick Sellars, to burn the houses around the people's ears if
they would not move out.
One old woman died in the conflagration of her own home when Sellars
applied this instruction. Sellars was tried for murder for this act and
was subsequently found ''not guilty''.
Social engineering? For the benefit of the Highland peoples? I think
not.

I MUST respond to comments by Mr Nicholas Roche (April 11) concerning
my request that a flag flying at a polling place be removed on election
day.
My job as Returning Officer is to ensure impartiality at elections.
When it was drawn to my attention on election day that the Saltire was
flying over Carnock Primary School, I had regard to the fact that at
least two political parties had used the Saltire as an emblem on
election literature distributed in Fife during the election campaign
period.
To avoid any suggestion of partiality, therefore, I asked that the
flag be taken down, to be reinstated the day after the election.
The decision was mine and mine alone and I would have taken exactly
the same view had any other flag or emblem fulfilled the criteria I have
described.

NICHOLAS ROCHE is right to condemn the lamentable objections of the
Labour Party that led to the removal of the Saltire from Carnock Primary
School during the local elections (April 11).
However, he should not have been surprised. After all, flags are
symbols, the St Andrew's Cross is the ancient banner of Scotland, and
the party in question chooses to be symbolised by the red rose of
England.

AN operating theatre. The camera catches the handsome young surgeon's
piercing blue eyes from above his mask. It is a look of sheer
concentration. A nurse mops his sweating brow as he delivers his lines.
''Forceps,'' he says; ''clamp.'' In the background there is the steady
beep of a heart monitor. Everyone looks worried sick, and all they're
doing is removing a wean's tonsils.
Ah, don't you just love medical dramas. Well, someone must. Never
before in the history of television have there been so many of them on
our screens. The BBC, ITV and Channel Four seem to be permanently
engaged in a game of doctors and nurses.
Count them. Already this year we've had Casualty, Dangerfield, and Dr
Finlay. Currently we've got ER, Chicago Hope, and Peak Practice. Add to
this a list which has included Dr Kildare, Ben Casey, St Elsewhere,
Emergency Ward Ten, General Hospital, and A Country Practice, and you
soon realise that sickness, particularly when it's life-threatening, is
a healthy crowd puller for television.
Why? Is it a case of there but for the grace of God (and good health)
goes the viewer? Or is it perhaps because we get a vicarious pleasure
from seeing gallons of blood spilled on the operating table as patients
are cut open with the surgeon's scalpel? Maybe it's a bit like that
ghoulish compulsion we have about real accidents: how a crowd is always
drawn to the scene of a road crash.
Whatever the reason, it means a guaranteed audience rating. You want a
hit show? Then make it medical. Touch and go; life and death. There you
are of a Saturday evening, dipping into your tacco chips, and on the
screen before you is a scene which bears a striking resemblance to the
salsa sauce on the coffee table -- a shot of an emergency tracheotomy at
Holby General. And why is it that every time someone has a heart attack
on the telly, you suddenly feel a sharp pain in your arm, a mysterious
tightness in your chest? Or is that just me?
Of the current crop of medi-dramas, ER with its frantic pace, beats
all the rest into a cocked hat. Ambulances literally crash through the
double doors of the casualty department; hip doctors leap on top of
patients and thump their hearts back to life; surgeons cut to the sound
of James Brown blasting through a set of speakers in the operating
theatre -- and no scene is more than a minute long.
There are a number of standard character requirements for any
successful medical drama, of course. A hospital helps, for a start. Then
you need a heart-throb -- usually a conscientious, young male doctor
(divorced because his wife couldn't handle the long hours) who is
constantly under pressure and looks as if he's in danger of cracking up.
Then you need the flawed genius brain surgeon -- over-confident and
self-important; a man who does not respect authority, a man who takes
risks.
Naturally there also has to be a beautiful woman. She can either be a
doctor or a nurse -- maybe a receptionist at a pinch -- and she has to
have had an affair (now finished) with one or both of the aforementioned
doctors.
Last, you need the voice of reason -- usually in the shape of a
balding, more mature doctor who's been there, seen it, done it, and
lived to tell the tale. The only requirement left is a sad collection of
patients, suffering from terminal cancer, extraordinarily rare diseases,
and serious injuries which need dramatic emergency treatment.
Then along comes the second series of Cardiac Arrest (BBC1, Wednesday)
and breaks the mould; kind of. The NHS hospital from Hell. Virginia
Bottomley's anti-Christ. If ER was fast, then this is positively racing.
In the first of eight half-hour shows there are more dead bodies than
you could shake a stethoscope at.
Directors Jim Gillespie and Sam Miller have built this one for speed.
Writer John McUre, a former junior doctor in an NHS hospital, tells it
like it is. It's riddled with humour that's darker than two in the
morning. You don't laugh at the jokes, you shudder. A young doc tries to
revive a patient suffering from horrendous chest injuries after a car
crash. The intern gives him cardiac massage but, as he thumps his chest,
his hands smash through the rib cage. ''Oops,'' says the doc.
Cardiac Arrest, made by Tony Garnett's World Productions for BBC
Scotland, was shot in an unused section of Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow.
Most of the cast from the first series return -- with the classy
addition of Australian Peter O'Brien (the pilot in Flying Doctors) as a
roller-skating surgical registrar aka ''Scissors''.
McUre says: ''The second series has been written to be faster. It's
better television; and in medicine lots of things are happening at once,
and people who can keep pace get better results.
''I was still working as a doctor when I wrote the first series, and
the experience I had then suggested there were other things that needed
to be said about the NHS. I became more politically involved with the
NHS through my involvement with the BMA and the Junior Doctors'
Committee.
''In the past year there have been a lot of stories in the press
reflecting the relationships between doctors, nurses, and managers.
Managers are blaming the medical staff and hospital staff are blaming
managers.''
McUre (his name is a pseudonym) hated his job as a doctor and he hopes
that the programme gets over the message that there's a great deal of
resentment and anger about the working conditions of junior hospital
doctors.
''That's not something I can write about in a detached way. I was
there -- and those things happened to me. Not necessarily in the form
they're portrayed on television, but experiences like them happened all
the time. It's a very genuine personal anger and I've tried to put that
into the series,'' he says.
SEALED with a controversial kiss, Roger Michell's Screen Two film
adaptation of Jane Austen's Persuasion (BBC2, Sunday) will raise a few
eyebrows among the literary purists. For this classic love story,
starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, the respected director has
dispensed with much of the costume gloss we have come to expect from
television period drama. Instead he relies on a more realistic approach
with crumpled clothes and a conspicuous absence of fancy wigs.
Austen's tale concerns the relationship between the heroine, Anne
Elliot, and her ex-fiance, dashing naval captain Frederick Wentworth.
When the couple meet again seven years after their break-up, old
emotions come back to haunt them and, eventually, alter the course of
their lives.
Ultimately, the film strays from the author's original story line by
ending with a kiss between the two main characters. The passionate
embrace was insisted on by the BBC's co-producer, a US TV company, to
suit American audiences. Originally, Michell made two endings for the
film, one for the British and the other for the Americans. But when he
compared them he decided that the kiss was necessary, so he kept it in
for both sides of the Atlantic.
IT'S a choice between vicars and tarts on Sunday night as The Choir
(BBC1) and Band of Gold (Scottish) reach their respective conclusions.
Curiously, bearing in mind the very different subject matter, it could
be a difficult choice. Joanna Trollope's story of Middle England
cassock-and-surplice intrigue has improved over the course of its
four-week run, thanks to some fine casting and well-paced direction.
But it's Kay Mellor's gritty, compelling, North of England drama about
prostitutes which wins on points. In the final episode we find out the
identity of Gina's killer -- who could be one of half-a-dozen male
characters, each one seedier than the one before. Thanks to the success
of the series -- 14 million viewers have tuned in every week -- Granada
Television has now embarked upon a sequel.
Trollope, meanwhile, would appear to be the flavour of the month on
television. A Village Affair (Scottish, Monday), a two-hour adaptation
of another of her novels, stars Sophie Ward, Kerry Fox, and Nathaniel
Parker. It is, as its name rather suggests, the story of a passionate
and illicit love affair which explodes one summer in an apparently
idyllic English village.
JIMMY Perry and David Croft have provided television with some of the
most durable sitcoms of the past 25 years, including It Ain't Half Hot
Mum, Dad's Army, and Hi-de-Hi! Now Omnibus (BBC1, Tuesday) celebrates
their writing partnership. The affectionate profile traces their career
from its origins in the early sixties.
Croft, then a respected director of classic comedy shows, was working
on Hugh And I and cast Perry in a minor role. During conversation, Perry
suggested the idea for a sitcom based on his experiences in the Home
Guard -- and Dad's Army was born. Later the pair, who had both been
stationed in India during their National Service, started working on It
Ain't Half Hot, Mum.
They discuss their work, which they describe as ''the comedy of
failure'', and the origins of some of their key characters. The
programme also includes contributions from, among others, Bob Monkhouse,
Clive Dunn and Su Pollard.
THIS week sees the welcome return of the
perfectly-rehearsed-but-entirely-spontaneous quiz show, Have I Got News
For You (BBC2, Friday). Julian Clary and Labour MP Diane Abbott join the
usual suspects: Merton, Hislop, and Deayton, in the first of the new
series. Safe to assume that Nick Leeson, the latest round of ministerial
resignations, and Martin Amis's very expensive teeth will feature in the
ensuing weeks.
In a bid to keep the show fresh, some new rounds have been introduced.
They include one on the daft sentences handed out by even dafter judges,
another about celebrity quangos, and a third in which each team is
provided with the plans to some of Britain's top jails and invited to
plot an escape.

Is Russia's involvement in Chechnya, and now Afghanistan, defensive or
something more sinister?
THE Cold War is over, the Berlin Wall is no more, the Red Army has
gone from Europe, and the West's leaders will flock to Moscow next month
to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany and underline their new ties of
friendship and close co-operation with the Kremlin.
But the reports of Russian jets bombing an Afghan border town and of
Russian troops ''massacring'' Chechen villagers are surely reminders --
if any were necessary -- that Russia is heavily armed, authoritarian,
confused, and always prepared to throw its weight around to defend what
it believes to be its legitimate interests.
The air strikes on Taloqan, in northern Afghanistan, which were said
to have killed more than 100 people, have resulted from the Kremlin's
involvement with the beleaguered government of Tajikstan, the poorest of
the former Soviet republics.
The town is suspected of harbouring Islamic insurgents trying to
overthrow the Tajik rulers -- and Moscow has made it clear that it will
not allow that to happen. Thus the Russians dominate a force of 18,000
border guards of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) which is
now locked in an increasingly bitter and bloody conflict.
However, the air raids in Afghanistan -- where, it is worth recalling,
some 15,000 Russians died in a decade-long war that ended only when the
Kremlin withdrew in 1989 -- represent a dangerous escalation. Russia is
determined to be seen as the defender of the borders of the former
Soviet Union (and to this end, among other things, has recreated the
Soviet air defence system) and it is precisely the sort of conflict in
the highly sensitive Central Asian republics that could develop into a
war.
Effectively Russian troops are now involved in a war on two fronts.
For although all of Chechnya's most populated zones are at last under
Moscow's control, President Boris Yeltsin's campaign to crush the tiny
rebellious Caucausian republic is by no means at an end.
Moreover, the Russian Army's brutality in Chechnya continues to
bedevil President Yeltsin's attempts to keep on the best of terms with
Western leaders. One of the worst atrocities in the four-month conflict
appears to have taken place in the town of Samashki at the weekend.
More than 250 civilians may have been killed when 3000 Russian
soldiers stormed the town ostensibly to flush out the forces of the
Chechen separatist leader, Dzokhar Dudayev.
Predictably the Russians deny any wrong-doing in Samashki, claim to
have killed only Chechen fighters there, and insist if any civilians
were killed they had been shot by the Chechens themselves. But the
reports certainly set back attempts by the Kremlin to distract attention
from the carnage of its disastrous and bungled Chechen adventure ahead
of the gathering of Western leaders in Moscow on May 9.
There is no doubt, however, that the ragtag Chechen army is on the
run. Several other towns have been abandoned in recent weeks as their
defenders fled to the mountains apparently with the aim of regrouping
and carrying on the struggle.
The Russian military's inability to kill or capture Dudayev remains an
embarrassment. Dudayev is believed to be in the mountains, where he has
again called for a political settlement of the conflict while bitterly
condemning Russian's ''unprecedented cruelty'' against civilians.
It is clear, however, that Moscow will have no truck with him -- in
fact the Russian high command has compiled a list of Chechen leaders it
intends to liquidate as soon as it can get its hands on them. Their plan
for Chechen independence was always a non-starter.
President Yeltsin can be expected to assure Western leaders that the
main military operation in Chechnya is over. But he will certainly
defend the use of force to remove what he has called the ''cancerous
growth of the Grozny regime'' and he might even offer up some kind of
apology for the deaths of many thousands of civilians.
Meanwhile regular Russian Army units are said to have begun pulling
out and are being replaced by Interior Ministry troops and a new
pro-Russian Chechen police force. Dudayev says he intends to use the
Caucasus as a base to launch a guerrilla war against the Russians and
their Chechyen collaborators.
The West could usefully try to make up its mind about Yeltsin's Russia
before the gathering in Moscow next month. For example, does the Russian
action against the Afghanistan border town and in Chechnya constitute
legitimate Russian defence of its interests -- or is it crude
interference or old-fashioned expansionism?

SHARPE'S back, damn your eyes and pass the ammunition. Having
unaccountably failed to wrap up the Peninsular War in previous outings,
Sean Bean and the South Essex Authentically Scrofulous Irregular Rifles
returned this week to give another plot ''based'' on the novels of
Bernard Cornwell 50 strokes of the cat while, somewhere off in the
distance, history went about its business.
Sharpe's Gold (ITV, Wednesday) was the silliest adventure in which the
moody rifleman and his SWAT team have yet participated. With Boney to be
bashed, our hero was over the hills and far away, in this instance
slaughtering some Spanish natives who believed they were descended from
Aztecs, and therefore obliged to practise human sacrifice.
The two-hour film had all the familiar Sharpe elements. He and his
smelly squad of crack marksmen are still invulnerable (''Tis but a
scratch, ma'am''); the love interest (Wellington's niece, in this case)
is still destined to face a fate worse than death at the hands of some
swarthy psychopath in the last 15 minutes; Sharpe is still the only
officer in the army without a razor; and the war still doesn't matter
much, if at all.
This last isn't too surprising, given that Wellington is attempting to
invade France via the Ukraine. Why the Ukraine? Perhaps this question
has been answered before, but the thought that Spain is no longer
Spanish enough to impersonate itself is worrying. Possibly it proves a
point about costume drama on television: history itself, the muddle of
facts and political forces, is rarely adequate to the demands of blood,
guts, and bonking.
Yet for all that Bean is an authentic hero in the old style, his swash
less buckled than spot-welded, his smouldering resentment (and Bean
smoulders like a bucket of firelighters) splendidly watchable. The
filmic key here is The Dirty Dozen. Sharpe and his boys don't give a
toss about king and country. They fight and (almost) die because they
must. They fight because orders is orders, the world is ill-divided, and
because the common man can do nowt about t'class system, lad.
Thus, all officers save Wellington and his wily spymaster are
buffoons. Thus Sergeant Pat is given a couple of lines on his dream of
Ireland's liberation. Thus the best shot in the company must, each week,
give us a ballad of the soldier's lot (it's not a happy one). Bean,
meanwhile, plays Sharpe as a man articulate only in action. His is the
role model for all would-be male sex symbols: say less and do more.
Grant this much, though: loving attention is paid to props. Debates
over muskets and rifles sound real enough, and the uniforms look pretty
good. Grant too that few TV movies could sustain your interest for two
very solid hours. The only pity is that no one could find anything
sufficiently interesting in the real Peninsular War worth turning into a
plot. Nice to see, though, that the Aztecs brought their own cocaine.
Making things up was something Jerzy Kosinski did to spectacular
effect. My edition of his 1975 novel Cockpit contains, for example, an
admiring afterword, ''On Kosinski'', which gives every appearance --
right down to a selection from his cuttings -- of having been written by
the author himself. Kosinski was weird, but the full extent of his
strangeness only became clear after bad reviews prompted his suicide in
1991.
Sex, Lies and Jerzy Kosinski, the latest in the consistently good
Bookmark series (BBC2, Tuesday) asked what happens when a man whose art
is invention turns out to have invented himself in every detail.
Kosinski lived his life as if it were a novel, and a film producer, of
all people, said: ''He felt fiction and life should merge''.
Interspersed with images from Bosch, a star cast -- Styron, Jong,
Polanski -- tried to grapple with mimesis and deceit. Jong couldn't see
any problem with ''an artist'' writing an intensely moving book about
the Holocaust (Painted Bird) that pretended to be autobiography and
turned out to be a pack of lies. Styron said Kosinski was ''a gifted,
appealing con-man'' whose work didn't stand up. Only Polanski, the
oldest acquaintance, seemed to understand the paradoxes. Given his own
career, that was perhaps no surprise.
We heard a lot about Jerzy's bizarre sex life and his social climbing.
We saw some Polish peasants who remembered the boy and had heard of his
books. They thought hell was, on balance, too good for him. His suicide
amounted, perhaps, to tacit agreement.
But the big question lurked in the background: if fiction's job is to
sport with reality, what happens when the writer forgets what reality
is? Kosinski wrote Being There, later turned into a vehicle for Peter
Sellers, another wilful amnesiac. This Bookmark, with its admirable
combination of rigour and delicacy, might have been entitled Being
Where? The whole idea was a good one.
The Baldy Man (ITV, Thursday) was, meanwhile, a good little idea
turned into two big, bad ones. Gregor Fisher has made even your
columnist laugh in the past with his deluded slaphead but this, albeit
divided into two short films, seemed a sight gag too far.
Putting aside the Mr Bean problem, and the fact that semi-silent
comedy has defeated even the likes of Mel Brooks before now, you have to
ask how many variations there can be on one joke. Let's say five
minutes' worth, with room for ad breaks, and even that might be
stretching it it further than The Baldy Man's few strands will go.
Stretching it beyond sanity was the ferociously aspiring woman around
whom The Anchor revolved in the last of Channel Four's Naked News
(Thursday). A product of agents, voice coaches, appearance coaches,
''news consultants'' (the folk who ''borrow your watch and tell you what
the time is''), this person was beside herself with excitement ('This is
great!'') when 130 people died in an aircraft disaster. Nothing to do
with death's meaning; everything to do with the fact that the tragedy
would replace her ''snowblower story''.
In America, ''when it bleeds, it leads''. Anchors on local TV in LA
command $1.8m a year; the people who write the words get $50,000. CBS,
meanwhile, lays off reporters and closes offices to pay anchors' wages.
Consultants decree you must have ''action'', any action, within the
first 12 seconds of a bulletin. Old Walter Cronkite shakes his shaggy
head and says ''perversion''.
Coming soon, if not sooner, to a local news bulletin in your area.
Don't touch that dial.

As North Sea companies consider cost-cutting, Graeme Smith reports on
how oil platform standby vessels operate.
THERE can have been no more welcome sight for the survivors of a North
Sea helicopter ditching than a fast rescue craft whipping its way over
20ft waves to their aid. Inside were three of the unsung heroes of the
North Sea, taken for granted except by people who owe them their lives.
Day in, day out, no matter the weather, those who work in the
frequently hazardous conditions of the United Kingdom's oil and gas
installations are protected by a fleet of standby ships whose crews have
to endure exceptional conditions. They cannot run for cover when the
winds howl to 90 miles an hour and when the waves rise to the height of
a five-storey building. They have to remain on location near the men
they protect.
For 28 days at a time they circle their installations, moving in close
when men are working over the side, but never venturing more than five
miles away. They cost the operators about #3000 a day but the 12-man
crews are not well paid, earning far less than the men they protect who
live in the relative comfort of the installations. Yet cuts threaten.
They are expensive to charter because a new vessel can cost around #7m
and to convert a former supply vessel may cost around #750,000.
Some #200m has been spent on improvements to the standby fleet in the
past four years in the wake of the Cullen Inquiry into the Piper Alpha
disaster but already some of the vessels on which the money has been
invested have been sidelined.
New legislation covering the role of standby vessels is expected to be
law by the middle of this year and, at a time when the oil operators'
emphasis is on cost-cutting, there are fears that cut-backs could
diminish the role of vessels, and their number.
The Standby Ship Operators' Association have lobbied hard to highlight
the work they do and the necessity for cover at every installation, and
they are concerned about the future.
They have, however, been encouraged by work done recently by Elf
Enterprise and feel that if every other operator tackles the issue with
the same commitment then both the North Sea workforce and the standby
vessels will be protected.
Elf has carried out a major assessment of their requirements, looking
at a variety of controlling factors from legislation and company policy
to the type of fast rescue craft and the field layout, from weather
parameters to the number of people on board the installations.
They have come up with a plan which, although it will lead to a
reduction in the number of standby vessels and cost savings, will see
much of the savings re-invested in higher quality ships which have
facilities and equipment considerably superior to the Government's
existing guidelines.
The Grampian Freedom, which rescued the 18 passengers and crew from
ditching at the beginning of the year, is a typical current North Sea
standby vessel, although at 63 metres a little longer than average.
As you make your way aboard one of the first doors you pass is marked
''Morgue''. Every vessel has one with space for 10 in a room it is hoped
will never be occupied.
Up on the bridge there is an array of electronic equipment, from VHF
radios to contact marine traffic and a UHF long-range radio for contact
with shore and marine traffic to telex machines, daylight radar screens
and a printer out of which constantly updated weather forecasts arrive
for the master.
There is also a state-of-the-art global positioning satellite system
which tells exactly where they are to within a few metres.
On the deck are the scramble nets up which survivors will clamber to
safety and specially designed ladders which are held away from the hull
of the ship to enable divers to climb aboard wearing flippers.
In the centre of the deck, to the fore of the yellow helicopter
winching area, sits a rescue basket which can be thrown into the water
as a temporary haven for survivors until they are fished to safety. On
either side are the fast rescue craft which are so vital to the rescue
operation.
Time after time during their 28-day trips the ''man overboard'' siren
will be sounded and the crew will practice their procedures. They take
enormous pride in the fact that it normally takes them less than 140
seconds from the time the siren goes, to don their equipment, launch the
craft, reach a victim half a mile away and return him to the ship.
The twin-engined rubber craft will cope with almost any sea
conditions, with launching and recovery the most difficult procedures.
When the helicopter ditched the average height of the waves was about
14ft with every fifth or sixth 20ft.
I was given the opportunity to experience the skills of some of the
North Star Rescue teams in Aberdeen Bay in mill-pond conditions compared
with the rigours of the deep North Sea.
Skimming across the waves at 40 miles an hour I could imagine the
relief which a wet, tired victim of a disaster would feel as he saw the
''Rescue Zone'' of the orange-hulled parent ship approaching. Seconds
later the craft is hooked on, hoisted up and the survivors are in a
treatment room receiving medical care.
In the foyer of North Star's harbour office in Aberdeen hangs a plaque
listing the incidents in which their vessels have saved lives. It
relates how more than 58, from fishermen to supply vessel and helicopter
crews as well as oil workers, have been rescued.
Mr Jeremy Daniel, chairman of the Standby Ship Operators' Association,
has some concerns about the Prevention of Fire and Explosion and
Emergency Response Regulations which will come out later this year along
with an approved code of practice and guidance on the regulations.
The oil companies will be required by these regulations to assess what
might go wrong and provide emergency response plans to cope.
''It is a question of the oil company satisfying itself and ultimately
the HSE that the response time is reasonable,'' he said. ''We are
concerned about it to say the least. We have watched with interest what
Elf have done to cover their Piper, Claymore and Saltire fields. They
have come up with a number of scenarios of what might go wrong and
looked at the wherewithal to recover personnel.''
He said that the maximum recovery time they have set for in incident
in which someone falls overboard while carrying out ''over-the-side''
work on an installation is four minutes, which is exactly the same time
that his association and the United Kingdom Offshore Operators'
Association had arrived at.
''If someone's heart stops and you get it going again within five
minutes there is not only a reasonable chance he will survive but will
survive without permanent brain damage,'' he said. ''One of the things
that happens when people fall into cold water is that their heart may
well stop completely from cold shock and will not start again of its own
accord.''
He said, however, that for recovering people from a ditched helicopter
the target time, which has not yet been publicly specified, was longer
because the passengers and crew would be wearing immersion suits and it
was therefore unlikely their hearts would have stopped from cold shock.
''I believe they probably have got it about right for both these
scenarios,'' he said. He also believes Elf's proposals for a major
evacuation are reasonable. ''If there is another Piper Alpha it would be
very lucky if the vessel was on close standby.
''Because of all the precautions which have been taken to try to avoid
such a scenario one must reasonably expect there will be a certain
amount of warning. If not enough to get everyone off by helicopter
enough to bring the recovery assets, including the standby ship and fast
rescue craft, in -- so perhaps around half an hour might be reasonable.
''I think Elf have come up with quite a good answer and will be happy
if every other oil company goes through a similar process and uses
similar sorts of response times. If they don't, I will be very much more
worried.''
Mr Daniel said he was concerned that because the regulations do not
specify a requirement for actual standby ships, other solutions might be
accepted which in his view will not achieve the objective properly.
''For example, in the middle of summer it is obviously sensible to
look at having fast rescue craft on an installation which you can launch
to fish people out of the water. He said that it was a completely
different proposition in bad weather, particularly if it involved a crew
who were not seamen and did not have the experience of the standby
vessel crews.''
He said Elf's proposals would reduce the number of standby ships but
would provide ships which cost them considerably more per day but had
greater capability.
They carried ''daughter'' craft which could sit immediately adjacent
to a platform while work was being carried out over the side instead of
the vessel itself being deployed.
''Elf will be able to deploy the ships and fast rescue craft more
flexibly and we will, I hope, have even better vessels. It will cost
them slightly less money and everyone should be happy.''

I AM curious to know whether those who complained about the saltire
flown over Carnock Primary School (April 7) would describe themselves as
representatives of Scottish Labour.
I wonder also which flag they would like to see flying over the
proposed Scottish assembly.

YOUR editorial devotes considerable space to the execution of one man
in Georgia (April 10). On any objective scale it must be insignificant
compared with events in Rwanda and elsewhere. Why does it get so much
attention? Is it because it is done on behalf of the state? During the
war many of us were engaged in killing on behalf of the state but I
don't recall any individual death attracting so much attention.
You describe the process as electrocution but it may not be so,
perhaps more electrocooking, according to physiologist Harold Hillman.
Clearly the design of the electric chair took place when the
physiological effects of electric current were not understood and it has
never been updated.
In accidental electrocution the victim is knocked unconscious because
the heart is stopped, and if help is at hand he can be resuscitated with
few after-effects and no memory of the incident. I am not in favour of
capital punishment, but if it has to take place it would be more humane
to simulate accidental electrocution by using a modified defibrillator.
The body would not then be structurally damaged and the organs
suitable as transplants. It would be fitting that a person who had taken
life would as a final atonement help others to live.
The very long time between conviction and execution has been condemned
as cruel but may not be against the wishes of the convict.
I presume some may have died of natural causes in death row, in which
case the capital sentence may not have shortened their lifespans. You
don't get much chance of living a natural span when execution is quick.

AS his attitude towards the troubles in Northern Ireland demonstrates,
President Clinton has a penchant for intervening in the internal affairs
of the United Kingdom.
In the light of the recent atrocity perpetrated in Georgia, perhaps
the time has come for our Government to return the compliment by sending
a mission to make the Americans aware of their abysmal record of
violations of human rights, particularly in the President's native
swamps of the Deep South.
The members of Mr Clinton's Democratic Party are probably too
preoccupied with events in Northern Ireland to realise what is happening
in their own backyard.
We could also help them to combat the terrorism on their streets where
more US citizens have been killed as a result of the absence of gun
control than have ever been killed on the streets of Northern Ireland.
To that end I suggest that a permanent department, staffed by experts
in constitutional law, with the sole purpose of helping the more
rational citizens of the USA combat the malign influence of the National
Rifle Association by working for the repeal of the Second Amendment of
the Constitution, the one which states that ''a well regulated Militia,
being necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the
people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed'', be established
in the British Embassy in Washington.

AT the initiation of any new enterprise, especially at national level,
it is most encouraging when attention is drawn to it by a contributor so
well-known as Stewart Lamont (April 8).
A small group aided by a larger advisory council met less than a year
ago to discuss the concept of a handbook giving details of churches of
all denominations which would welcome visitors during this year.
If we had not received support from charitable trusts and some
individual benefactors, and without the generous sponsorship from the
Bank of Scotland, this first handbook could not have been produced.
Stewart Lamont is perfectly right: it would have been wonderful if
more than 128 churches were participating (and incidentally Paisley
Abbey is indeed one of our enthusiastic supporters), but we have made a
promising start, and some of the letters and messages of thanks and
encouragement from individual churches have been most uplifting.
We have been in touch twice in this last year with every church in
Scotland -- an ambitious personal dispatch to almost 3000 churches. We
very much hope that we shall have many more entries for the next edition
of the handbook.
As it is, Stewart Lamont points out that the spread of interest and of
location throughout Scotland and demonstrates the exceptionally diverse
stories which so many churches can tell.
Perhaps it is through out churches with each one's individual history
that we can stimulate a keener awareness of our heritage and encourage a
closer feeling of working together amongst the churches themselves.
Scotland's Gardens Scheme has successfully achieved so much goodwill
amongst gardeners. We hope our scheme will generate a keener ecumenical
spirit. May it also spur on financial support for the churches visited
and enjoyed under Scotland's Churches Scheme.

WHEN we watched a presentation of Russia through the eyes of Alexander
Solzhenitsyn, admittedly as interpreted by the BBC, we were made aware
of some of the shortcomings of Communist rule in the USSR, (or our
knowledge of this was reinforced), and of the current problems created
by the recent changes in the political structure.
It left a question mark: have the Russians tumbled from the frying pan
into the fire?
We tend to accept information given to us in this format as being a
fair, genuine exposition.
Would it not be useful, informative, and thought-provoking if we were
shown footage of documentary films made by reputable foreign
commentators, commissioned by their respective governments or TV
stations, for local consumption, which were looking at the society which
prevails in our country today and of which we are relatively blind
because we stand too close to it, being within it?

LOTS of information in The Herald on the ailments of the Channel
Tunnel prompts me to reveal my problems in trying to use it.
As early as January, I called at two travel agents asking for
information including prices for a car and two passengers. Both supplied
me with the same glossy brochure extolling the virtues of the tunnel but
no prices.
As late as two weeks ago I approached a third travel agent and asked
the same question. I was told they were fed up trying to get information
about prices for travellers and had given up.
It seems to me that whoever is marketing the tunnel is under the
impression that we are all dying to use it and do not care about cost.
I, for one, am crossing by the same ferry route I used last year.

THERE Sara Villiers goes again (Men and the satanic curse of shopping
-- April 12), judging the entire male species on the few hopeless
individuals that she has encountered.
What she fails to take into account is that the only reason her male
compatriots feign hopelessness in shops is because they know some
soft-hearted female, probably Ms Villiers, will come to their rescue.
There's nothing like a little-boy-lost look over the frozen meat
counter to bring out the mothering instincts in most women.
Thus the men get their shopping done with little or no effort and the
women get to feel superior.
It was ever thus.

OSCAR WILDE must have been one of the few people to advocate crime as
a remedy for poverty. ''Man should not be ready to show that he can live
like a badly fed animal,'' he wrote. ''He should either steal or go on
the rates, which is considered by many to be a form of stealing. As for
begging, it is safer to beg than to take, but it is finer to take than
to beg.'' The virtuous poor, he declared, must also be extraordinarily
stupid.
He argues the case so persuasively, in The Soul of Man Under
Socialism, that with the Inland Revenue's brown envelopes dropping
through letter boxes, and Labour's lead in the opinion polls, one feels
almost a moral duty to follow his advice. According to a survey in
Moneywise magazine, alas, despite their voting intentions, British
citizens remain models of honesty and integrity. Income tax does pose
the greatest temptation, with more than a quarter of men saying they
would hang on to an overpaid rebate, but only 9% would keep money they
found on a train. One of the most significant revelations is that women
are far more honest than their male counterparts. If a bank machine gave
them extra money, 19 out of 20 women say they would actually go in and
pay it back, despite the banking world's notorious reluctance to admit
errors in the other direction.
It is possible that we face patterns in crime. In New York, where
almost every household door now has three locks, backed up by an alarm
system, it was reported this week that burglary has become such hard
work that regular criminals are switching to street robbery. Even the
most upright of citizens can be faced with sudden temptation. At Al
Paso, Texas, when a security guard failed to shut his van door properly,
the rush-hour traffic was brought to a halt by fluttering $20 bills. Mr
Rudy Vega filled a sack, threw it into the back seat, and drove home
unseen, where he counted out cash worth #278,800. He sat staring at it
on the kitchen table for five hours, and finally drove to the local FBI.
''My conscience would have bothered me,'' he said. It would be
interesting to know how many of us would have done the same.

''ON a hill far away stood a new electric chair, the symbol of
suffering and shame.'' It doesn't quite fit, but it captures a little of
the shock effect which the crucifixion symbol must have induced in those
who were introduced in its early days to the religion whose founder was
crucified. Victorian hymns have taught us to think of Jesus' cross as
''old rugged'' or ''wondrous'' and ''towering o'er the wrecks of time''
whereas the original would have been far from awesome. It would have
been nasty and bloody, more like a necklacing in a South African
township.
The recent use of an electric chair in Georgia has concentrated minds
about this method of capital punishment, and many were shocked that such
practices are permitted in states in which a majority would count
themselves as Christians. It is a timely reminder that, despite the
passage of nearly two thousand years since Christ was put to death, in
today's world we could still muster a similar scenario to the one which
led to his death.
Jesus was arraigned for a mixture of blasphemy and treason. A charge
of blasphemy still carries the death penalty in Pakistan, as we were
recently reminded; and the fatwah against the writer Rushdie has yet to
be revoked. In other countries, religious dissidents are snuffed out by
death squads without even the benefit of a mock trial. In others which
enjoy a more developed system of justice, public hatred might be aroused
if the new religion were to be portrayed as a dangerous cult, such as
the one which released poisonous gas into the Tokyo underground. Another
possibility would be a false conviction for terrorism -- a fate which
befell rather too many in our own country in recent years, who at their
trials were conveniently fitted to our own anti-christ of the IRA
bomber.
Faced with these current examples, it is difficult to maintain that it
could not happen again, here or now. One of the enduring facets of the
Passion story through the centuries has been its relevance to
contemporary events. Despite the fact that it happened a long time ago
in a very different world, it keeps resonating with human situations and
emerges with a new and sharp appeal. Even when subsumed with pagan myths
to produce an Easter story which sees resurrection as part of nature's
cycle of death and rebirth, the pantheistic Christ is still at the sharp
end of contemporary events, and the Passion becomes the ecological
mission to save the world from pollution.
The scars of Jesus can be replicated in so many ways in today's world
that it is not surprising that the Passion remains a deep and sustaining
truth for many people, despite the inroads which secularism has made.
The resurrection of Jesus is more difficult to root in contemporary
experience, but there is a possible current parallel -- the fiftieth
anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camps.
No greater horror could be imagined than these vile places, nor more
evil people than those who ran them, men such as Commandant Josef Kramer
of Bergen-Belsen. Indeed during this weekend in particular we are
remembering the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp by
British troops exactly 50 years ago.
These troops encountered grotesque scenes, almost beyond belief. The
camp was dominated by a giant gallows and a vast, open mass grave.
Scattered everywhere were piles of unburied corpses. Inside the huts,
emaciated half-dead humans lay beside rotting corpses. These Jews had
been tortured and murdered; or they had been allowed to die through
systematic neglect.
Yet it is not the hideous suffering that we should allow to dominate
the picture at this time, but rather the way in which the survivors
rebuilt their lives, and then went on to build a new nation, a new
Israel. Whether we share the Jewish or Christian tradition, these 50
years stand as a modern example that good can rise again from the ashes
of evil.

CLIMBER Alan Hinkes plans to continue with his bid to conquer one of
the world's most dangerous peaks, despite a serious leg injury.
The Newcastle upon Tyne-based adventurer spoke from a hospital in
Bangkok, where he is recovering after his left thigh was ''skewered'' by
a length of bamboo when he slipped from a jungle path in Nepal.
He went to Bangkok on the advice of doctors, who patched him up in the
Nepalese capital Kathmandu, a three-hour flight away.
Hinkes, 40, said that, although he still has a gaping wound, he hopes
to have recovered enough to climb K2, which, at 28,250ft, is the world's
second highest mountain, in June.
The consultant with Tyneside outdoor clothing specialist Berghaus was
injured in the early stages of a prior objective to become the first
Briton to climb 27,824ft Makalu in the Himalayas.
He was making for the base camp and still in jungle at 6000ft when he
slipped and was speared by the bamboo, he said.
''It ripped upwards into my left thigh, a bit like a Vietcong booby
trap,'' he said. ''I could see the whole of the inside of my thigh
exposed. At first I thought it had hit my femoral artery and that I was
a goner.
''But then I was relieved to see it hadn't. After that, I hobbled and
staggered on makeshift crutches to a village an hour away.''
After a 23-hour wait, he was flown by helicopter to Kathmandu, then
flown on to Bangkok.

EVENINGS are the most dangerous hours for do-it-yourself enthusiasts,
a report has revealed.
More accidents occur in and around the home on Sunday than any other
day of the week, with evenings being the hazard peak period.
The report by the Association of British Insurers says that 200,000
people are injured using do-it-yourself tools and equipment in the home
every year.
Apart from mishaps to amateur tradesmen, 5000 people are killed every
year from other types of accidents in the home and 3,000,000 people have
to seek hospital treatment, including 6000 of whom suffer serious
injuries.
The report says children under five and the elderly are the most
vulnerable, and least able to cope with injury and suffering.
Most serious accidents occur in the kitchen, while the largest number
of upsets happen in the living room.
Falls are the most common cause of injury, accounting for 44% of all
accidents.
A run-down of the annual casualty list shows that 297,000 people are
injured bumping into, or falling over, furniture; 245,000 injured
falling down stairs; 200,000 injured by DIY; 96,000 treated for burns;
and 76,000 who suffer animal bites.
''Most accidents in the home are preventable, with human error to
blame for most injuries. People are particularly vulnerable at times of
stress, where their routine is changed or as a result of unsafe
practices,'' says Mr Tony Baker, deputy director general for ABI.
''Home accidents can only be reduced by people being more aware of the
dangers in their home and taking steps to avoid them. A little extra
care and thought can save a great deal of misery and pain,'' he added.

THE Post Office is drawing up contingency plans to deal with a huge
backlog of mail because of a strike by delivery staff.
More than 2,000,000 letters and parcels were piling up in sorting
offices in the North-east of England because of a week-long stoppage by
almost 1000 workers at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
Talks aimed at settling the dispute broke down on Thursday.
The strike is over the introduction of a new shift pattern which the
Post Office said would lead to mail being delivered more quickly in the
region.
The Communication Workers' union rejected the new arrangements in a
ballot and launched a strike which is causing increasing disruption to
deliveries, particularly to firms.
A Post Office spokesman described the strike as ''totally
unnecessary'', adding: ''If this strike continues over Easter, it will
only be because the union has chosen to ignore the proposals we have
made to end it.''

''A GREY area'' is how the new Archbishop of York, Dr David Hope,
described his sexuality after a threat to ''out'' him by Peter Tatchell
and his bunch of phony moralists who style themselves ''Outrage''. I
would suggest a better name for them is Mudpack -- they don't so much
throw mud as wallow in it, and no doubt get a dubious thrill out of it
all. Poor Dr Hope. The Church of England has enough grey men in its
bench of bishops without becoming a walking grey area.
I have no sympathy for Dr Hope's views about women priests (he is agin
them in theory but accepts them in practice) and it can hardly be a
boost for the CofE that the second top man in its hierarchy is so
ambivalent about sexuality and so lukewarm about priests who happen to
be of the female sex. Viewed alongside the recent appointment of a man
who had been convicted of a sex offence in a public toilet as Bishop of
Durham (No 4 in the CofE hierarchy), I would say the CofE has a public
relations problem.
It also has a private relations problem with the number of clerics in
the closet who are ripe to be ''outed'' by Tatchell and his mob of
mud-slinging gays.
Prior to the Reformation there was a man called Tetzel who went around
selling indulgences for money. He was concerned with ''outing'' souls
which were stuck in purgatory. He used an advertising jingle which ran
something like: ''Once the coin in the coffer rings, the sinners soul
from purgatory springs!'' Tatchell and Tetzel are simply dung beetles of
a church into which the rot has set.
There are differences. The medieval Catholic church had too much money
and not enough interest in the sexual morals of its clergy (or lack of
them). The modern Church of England has not enough money and takes too
much interest in sexuality. To some extent the latter problem has been
afflicting all the churches. Sex scandals have unhappily been on the
increase and some churches have been convulsed by bitter debates about
whether or not to permit gay clerics. Perhaps this is a consequence of a
society obsessed with sex and in which whole sections of the media are
devoted to proselytising on behalf of homosexuality.
Channel 4 is as near to a gay TV channel as you could hope for if you
were that way inclined, and daily ads invite men and women to have
intercourse (verbal and telephonic at first) with those of similar
persuasion.
The medieval world had the plague. We have Aids. Neither should be
wished on anyone, but what I can wish for is that we could stop being
plagued with gay propaganda and the never-ending squeals about sexual
fulfilment. If we were insects whose life-purpose was fulfilled by
procreation then I could understand that living has been in vain if we
did not achieve this. But there is something too fevered and insistent
about a lot of the campaigns on sexuality which could lead you to think
that Descartes said, ''I have sex, therefore I am'' instead of ''I
think, therefore I am.''
It would be wonderful if there were a moratorium on the issue and
passions (of all genders) were allowed to cool. I promise I will not
return to it in this column unless severely provoked, but before I go
into my celibacy of silence, allow me to say why I believe the issue
will be so damaging to the churches if it continues to dominate their
agendas.
First, is the fact that Jesus spent very little time on questions of
sexual morality. They are not central to our wellbeing. Caring love
should not be confused with erotic love. We usually make fools of
ourselves when we do.
Second is the failure of many gay campaigners to dissociate themselves
from forms of sexual expression which are deeply offensive to reasonable
people, leading to a situation in which acceptance of so-called ''gay
rights'' appears to mean a licence to practise such behaviour, and that
anyone criticising this to be labelled oppressive.
For example, recruiting sexual partners in public toilets is repellent
to most people, as is having multiple partners within a short period, or
waggling willies about in steam rooms, or putting them in posteriors.
Can some of us be allowed to think this and not be labelled homophobic?
Third is the failure of heterosexual moralists to make a similar
differentiation between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Ageing
gentlemen who like to be associated with young men or watch sport are
hardly the devil incarnate. Should we grudge them their fantasies? Or
what about the faithful couple who live as man and wife but both happen
to be male? If they manifest caring love, should they be lumped with the
locker-room lurker and the promiscuous sensation-seeker?
The middle ground in this tedious debate is not for the faint-hearted.
They will be castigated by the gay activists as patronising and
hypocritical. They will be viewed as subversive and suspicious by the
puritans. The result is a debate in which deep suspicions are harboured
about the sincerity of those on the other side.
Last year the Kirk's Panel on Doctrine were polarised in this way but
this year have happily come up with a report in dialogue form which
helps to prevent this corrosive debate being more destructive and has
helped to heal divisions. I wish them luck as I distrust anyone who says
that morality is a matter of black and white. Have a grey day!

MORE people will die on Skye's mountains after the bridge to the
island opens, a mountain rescue chief has predicted.
Mr John MacLeod claimed the number of winter accidents would increase
because it would be easier for hillwalkers and climbers to get to the
difficult peaks of the Black Cuillins.
Mr MacLeod, chairman of Skye Mountain Rescue Team, expects an influx
of winter climbers to the island when the bridge opens in September.
The team has had only two winter call- outs this year but five
climbers died on Skye's hills in 1994.
He said: ''A traverse of the Cuillins in winter has only been done a
handful of times, making it one of the greatest challenges in British
climbing.''
The temptation for climbers to grasp that challenge when access was
easier, he claimed, was sure to mean more emergency call-outs for his
team of 30 rescuers.
Mr Macleod said: ''Any increase in the number of people on the hills
in bad weather could have worrying implications. We don't seem to get as
many winter climbers as the mainland areas but I think that might change
when the bridge opens.''
Mr MacLeod's opinion was that climbers would plan expeditions to the
island if they felt the bridge was more reliable than ferry services,
which can be affected by bad weather.
''We usually have fewer call-outs in winter than the mainland teams.
Climbers from further afield probably reach Nevis or Glencoe and feel
they have come far enough,'' said 53-year-old Mr MacLeod, who has been
involved with the rescue team for more than 30 years.
''The ferry is maybe a psychological barrier, with people not sure
about services or whether they will be put off by the weather.
''But the weather is not going to affect the bridge. Once it is open,
the predicted rush might take two or three years to settle down but we
feel we will still get more climbers and the more we get the more
chances there are for mishaps.
''We will just need to gear up for the likelihood that there may be
more call-outs.''

The NHS in Scotland is lagging behind England in the provision of
hi-tech imaging devices. Chris Holme reports.
A REVOLUTIONARY medical scanner developed with the help of Scottish
know-how is still noticeable by its absence in most NHS hospitals north
of the Border. The world's first MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
service started at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary 15 years ago. It was hailed
as the biggest diagnostic breakthrough since Rontgen discovered X-rays
100 years ago, enabling doctors to see into the body with a hitherto
unknown clarity.
The technique was devised by scientists at Aberdeen and Nottingham
universities. As with obstetric ultrasound, developed in Glasgow by
Professor Ian Donald, attempts to exploit Scotland's technological lead
commercially followed the road of frustration and failure. It was
exploited commercially elsewhere by manufacturers in Japan, Germany, and
the US.
Sales of patents brought a second machine to Aberdeen in 1983, giving
the city the same provision as the whole of England. Thereafter, for
nearly a decade, MRI was ignored by the NHS. By 1990 the San Francisco
Bay area had far more machines than the entire UK.
Scottish Health Minister Michael Forsyth ordered five machines which
are now being used. Others are coming on stream, but the total NHS
capacity is unlikely to exceed 10 by the end of this year. A further
three are installed in the private sector and there is an MRI scanner in
Edinburgh used for Aids research.
State provision in Scotland, which four years ago leaped ahead of
England, is now lagging behind. There are 110 MRI machines in the NHS
south of the Border, according to the Department of Health.
Frank Smith, consultant radiologist at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, who
started the service in 1980, said: ''We are still underprovided for.
There should be at least twice as many machines as there are at present
and that is without being extravagant.
''The technology developed in Scotland is now used throughout the
world, but provision here is well behind countries like Germany, France,
and Italy. Japan and the US are a million miles ahead.''
MRI has significant advantages over CT scanners, the workhorses of
hospital diagnostic radiology. It uses magnets instead of X-rays and
therefore carries no radiation risk. MRI also shows clearer detail,
although CT's proponents say it is more user-friendly and superior on
specific tasks like detecting bone calcification and bleeding from the
brain.
Powerful MRI machines costing #1m or more are still used for the head
and body but a new generation of smaller #400,000 models is now on the
market. Three of these models are on order in England. New York City
alone has 15 up and running.
Dr Smith said purchase and running costs for MRI were comparable with
CT. ''We are still lagging way behind the potential use of the
technique. We really should consider replacing CT scans with MR scans,''
he said.
''I am sure MRI has saved many lives over the past 15 years. It has
made earlier diagnosis possible and improved quality of live. It has
helped surgeons plan their operations earlier and removed a lot of
anxiety for patients who may have thought they had a brain tumour or
MS.''
Lack of MRI provision has undoubtedly had an impact on the way
medicine and surgery has developed in Scotland over the past decade. If
there is no means to investigate fully, problems are not seen, treatment
is not given, and patients who could have been saved have undoubtedly
died. Where physicians have no prospect of access to a technology, they
also tend to dismiss its worth.
However, over-provision can lead to costly and unnecessary
investigations. The US is notorious in this respect, where radiology
departments rule the roost of the hospital hierarchy.
NHS planners have to find the happy medium to balance need with
provision. They have a long way to go, but the advent of trusts has
provided a significant fillip. MRI is seen as the hi-tech status symbol
for any medium-sized trust hospital worth its salt and seeking to expand
business.
Edinburgh provides a good example. The Royal Infirmary is buying a
machine. The Western General, where waiting lists ran to four months,
acquired a second but demand has mushroomed to fill extra capacity. It
also scans patients from the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.
Not surprisingly, the RHSC is now looking for Scottish Office consent
to buy a machine for itself, thus saving the daily hassle of bundling
staff and sick youngsters into a taxi across the city for a scan. The
most gravely ill and most likely to benefit from MRI diagnosis cannot be
moved and do not get it.
The hospital argues that its international eminence in aspects of
treatment cannot be sustained by a diagnostic capability 30 years behind
the times. In common with Third World hospitals, it has no on-site CT,
never mind MRI.
At the same time, some would argue, scarce NHS resources paid for by
the taxpayer, are more efficiently used in a planned, integrated
service, rather than a proliferation of new MRI empires springing up in
every hospital. The new NHS internal market structure favours the
latter.
Applications of MRI have already extended to video pictures. Surgeons
in Boston are carrying out complex operations actually working inside
the scanner using video screens.
Closer imaging of the brain's functions may also open the prospect of
removing tumours previously considered inoperable and hitherto
unexplored areas of cardiac surgery and psychiatry in showing the
effects of drugs in treating conditions like schizophrenia.
This is a long way since Frank Smith carried out the first scans on
1000 patients, but the Mark I machine may yet play a major role in the
next generation of MRI.
Following the old principle of necessity being the mother of
invention, it is still being used by the university's department of
bio-medical physics and bio-enginering which built it.
Senior lecturer David Lurdie and his colleagues hope MRI can be
developed to track free radicals, the highly reactive particles which
could be implicated in the early stages of cancer, arthritis, multiple
sclerosis, and the damage caused by re-introduction of oxygen after
heart attacks.
They are using proton-electron double resonance imaging (Pedri),
combining the original Aberdeen spin-warp technique with the echo planer
work done in Nottingham.
Existing chemical tests can detect free radicals, but they have a
short life.
''That is not the same as seeing them. We hope to be able to test the
various hypotheses about free radicals by actually imaging them,'' Dr
Lurdie said.
''We are also developing another instrument based on a more
sophisticated version of Pedri. That should be ready by the end of the
year.''
The stumbling block is finding suitable chemicals to stabilise and
contrast the material, but a Scandinavian company is pursuing this.
''I think there is certainly potential there,'' Dr Lurdie added.
''Its clinical use is some years off but, of course, that is exactly
how MRI started out.''

<HEADLINE>Federation seeks talks about package.  Anger over top police pay deal</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
POLICE Federation officials are seeking urgent talks over a new pay
deal for a chief constable and his top officers, which would give them
cars and health insurance.
West Yorkshire Chief Constable Keith Hellawell and the five assistant
chief constable members of his command team are set to get new contracts
with rises, cars costing up to #22,000 each, and a BUPA private
health-care package.
The package was negotiated at meetings of a police authority working
party and are likely to be rubber-stamped by the authority later this
month.
However, critics claim the cost of the new cars alone would pay the
wages of eight probationary officers for a year.
Now West Yorkshire Police Federation chairman Inspector Roger Benn is
to ask Mr Hellawell for an urgent meeting to clarify the situation.
Superintendents Association secretary Nigel Sutcliffe, divisional
commander at Odsal in Bradford, described the package as ''somewhat
generous''.
He pointed out that superintendents had to take out their own personal
health care and received a set rate for mileage. Mr Sutcliffe said the
number of superintendents had been reduced by 40.
The cars would be available for both work and pleasure. The chiefs
currently drive their own cars, with a mileage allowance, and have
access to a pool car.
The police authority is also to be asked to remove the ceiling on
''reasonable'' hotel business bills and pay a higher proportion of home
phone bills and telephone rental for the command team.
Assistant chief constable Greg Wilkinson said yesterday that the
contracts were within the recently published police regulations.
In Strathclyde, federation leaders will discuss the controversy over
arming officers at a meeting with force leaders next month.
Federation secretary Tom Rowatt warned that officers' lives were at
risk because they were attending dangerous incidents unarmed, and added
that there was a growing concern among Strathclyde police that officers
were not adequately protected from violent, armed criminals.
He said: ''Unarmed officers are risking their lives dealing with
firearms' incidents. The last thing I want to see is a routinely-armed
police force but we must have the capability of dealing with every
situation. We want to air our concerns and have policies reviewed.''
The federation is due to meet Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)
Peter Gibson and Deputy Chief Constable Jim Richardson next month.
Meanwhile, a row erupted yesterday after it emerged the police are to
stop responding to every burglar alarm call because more than 90% prove
to be false.
Police in England and Wales will refuse to respond to some alarms and
give a lower priority to others.
Chief police officers decided to curb their responses after studying a
paper highlighting the huge number of time-wasting call-outs.
It is understood the scheme will grade households and businesses and
blacklist those which make more than six false alarms a year. Scottish
rank and file officers joined their English colleagues yesterday in
condemning the development.
Mr George Kilday, treasurer of Strathclyde branch of the federation,
told The Herald: ''To be fair, the Scottish chief constables have never
given indication that they are considering going down this road but if
they did, we would take exactly the same view as our colleagues in
England.''

REPTILE mania is sweeping Scotland -- and the latest craze is not for
Jurassic Park memorabilia.
Snakes and lizards are soaring in popularity as household pets,
according to the owners of an award-winning exhibition of the rare and
exotic creatures in Skye.
Illegal immigrants snatched by customs men while on passage from
Africa to the UK are among the range of cold-blooded creatures on show
at the Skye Serpentarium reptile exhibition at Broadford.
Husband and wife team Alec and Catherine Shearer have been unable to
keep up with the demand for snakes and lizards since they began a
breeding programme recently.
Former timber firm manager Alec, 50, who moved from Falkirk with
Catherine, 51, to start the business, said: ''We can't believe how many
folk want their own snake or lizards. The interest has been overwhelming
and we are launching a new breeding programme to meet the demand.
Interest is coming from Scotland, England, and even Europe.''
The centre is home to rare and endangered species of snakes and
lizards, including the Mangrove Monitor lizard, from the Pacific
Islands, where the natives still eat the flesh.

THE screens were arranged so that I could not see his face, even if I
leaned forward and tried to look through the gap between them. But I was
close enough to hear every nuance in his voice. Even when it was lowered
scarcely to a whisper, it was powerful, deep, resonant with the trace of
an accent. Galilean, he said it was, laughing a little. ''In today's
British terms I would be heard as someone distinctively from the
north-east. An Aberdonian in Scotland, or a Geordie in England.''
I didn't dwell on the incongruities of that. At least he hadn't turned
out to be a Yorkshireman -- and confirmed the pretensions to deity of
Geoffrey Boycott. The situation was incongruous enough. Myself, with
notepad in hand, sitting next to the screens like a penitent awaiting
confession. Except this was not my confession but my questioning Him.
What presumption! The realisation swept over me, paralysing my tongue
and wiping from my mind every question I had been asked to put by the
deputy editor. He must have sensed my discomfort.
''Perhaps you would like to start with the reason why I have refused
to show my face. It's not that I disapprove of photography, but I have
reason to be grateful that paparazzi only came on the scene long after
my ministry in Galilee. Can you imagine what they would have made of
those baptisms we used to conduct in the Jordan? Those being baptised
were usually naked . . . and I don't have to tell you what an unkind
person would make of that in today's context. However, that's not the
reason.
''I didn't worry about getting a bad press then and I won't start now.
My reluctance is because I don't want a profile which can be frozen in
time. Look at what harm people have done with icons or artefacts like
the Turin Shroud. They use them as a kind of telescope to see God and
end up with bad eyesight. They can't see past them. They teach us as
much about God as scarecrows in a cucumber field, as Isaiah used to
say.''
But what about the gospels? I managed to ask. Were these not word
portraits which were frozen in time?
''Precisely. And look at the trouble they have caused. People have
picked over the details like some coded despatch. I often used paradox
in my teaching, but never coded signals.
''Have you never wondered why I didn't commission someone to write
down my teaching or keep a proper record which couldn't be dismissed as
fraud or someone's overheated imagination? I discouraged it because I
knew that it would freeze the kingdom of God into the time frame of what
you now know as 30AD, whereas my purpose was that it should be illusive
and ever changing. It's the difference between the peace of a graveyard
and the peace of a fast-flowing river.''
Does that mean you might not return in human form, as has been
predicted?
''Not at all. I have returned. Time and again, in different forms. Did
I not warn my disciples to look for me not as they knew me then but as
waif and stranger, outcast and prisoner? The point is that I no longer
have the need to be human, but have assumed the form of human need. It
was necessary for Jesus to have a human history -- and he did so at a
critical point in history, the fulcrum between the ancient and the
modern world, between myth and history. Jesus was the culmination of one
process and the start of another.''
If you'll forgive me, you seem to speak about Jesus as if he was
another person?
''We are all other people at one time or another. The child is never
the same as the man. The Jesus of history was a Jew, worshipping in
synagogues. The Christ of faith is a different being, born partly from
God's revelation and partly from human experience. He and I assume many
forms. To tie me down to one system, symbol or culture is like saying
music can never use new melodies. The note I sounded during my earthly
life struck a chord at that time -- and has echoed down the centuries.''
Did you find that note yourself, or was it part of your nature?
''Ah yes, the old question of how much human I was and how much
divine. That certainly kept the pedants going for a few centuries after
my crucifixion, didn't it? I hope I don't shock you if I say that God
only knows. I was a creature -- part of his creation by being born as
the son of Mary and Joseph.''
Yes, but born in unusual circumstances?
''You're referring to what is known as the Virgin Birth, although it
should more properly be called the Virgin Conception. Well, you'll have
to ask my mother about that. After all, I was only an embryo at the
time. Frankly, I don't think it makes any difference if I was adopted by
God for his mission or intended for it from the very moment of birth.
What matters is how it turned out in the end.
''As for whether or not my birth was miraculous, I leave you to decide
-- but I ask you to consider this: why would God want to contradict the
laws of nature which he Himself set up? Furthermore, if my humanity was
simply a sham, then what was the point of me teaching people that their
salvation was in transforming reality by caring love when God or I could
fix any problems by waving a magic wand?''
But what about the miracles you performed?
''They were not miracles. Oh yes, they happened -- with the exception
of a few in which the enthusiasm of my followers carried them away when
they looked back and retold an incident, like the time I advised them to
fish the other side of the boat, or used the rocks to run across to the
shore. How I laughed when I saw what had been written about that! But
the healings -- the raising of Lazarus -- they did not contradict
natural laws. They simply used powers and potential that lie deep within
each one of us and which we do not use because we do not allow the
reality of spiritual things to come into daily living.
''I used to make an illustration about the lilies of the field and ask
how their beauty came about. That is a miracle, if there is such a thing
as a miracle. Similarly, there is the 'miracle' of someone being healed
of a disease which has rooted itself in their psyche even although it
has real, physical symptoms. When I healed these people I was not
contradicting the laws of nature. I was using them, the same way that
healers and hypnotists can produce dramatic results in people. Of
course, it helps to have faith.''
How do you mean?
''Well, if people are expecting something positive, wonderful, and
uplifting to happen, it makes it easier for this actually to occur.
Another way of looking at it is that it increases our feelings of awe
and wonder -- which go hand in hand with humility. Remember that saying
about the meek inheriting the earth? The reverse is true of course. When
people distrust you and are cynical, very little is likely to happen. I
remember when I went back to my home town I had very little success.
There's a bit about the incident in one of the gospels. They couldn't
see past the fact that I was Joseph's son, the carpenter. A bit like
what you Scots call 'I kent his faither'.''
We don't know much about that early period of your life -- about
influences on you.
''There's not much to tell. I don't think battles are won in the
playgrounds of which school we attended. I accept that genes and
environment have a great part in shaping our character, but my raison
d'etre is to show that there is a third and more fundamental factor --
spirit -- which can make or break our destiny. My own upbringing was
traditional, rural, religious. I spent some time with the Essene
community in my late teens. A lot of my preaching reflected their
traditions, although I must confess I find it rather strange that when
someone turns up an Essene manuscript in an old cave which contains
something similar to my teaching they go wild and think it disproves my
claim to authenticity (whatever that might mean). It simply proves that
we both know a good idea when we see it -- and I'm happy to have learned
from them.
''Another man I learned a lot from was John, who baptised me. He was a
real character and his death was a real blow to me. A lot of his
followers wanted to transfer their allegiance to me, but as events
developed it wouldn't have worked. John was a real ascetic. Rough,
tough, but tender-hearted. Our group was used to good food and wine, and
the two styles would not have mixed.''
You don't have a problem with the good food and wine?
''No. Should I? You're probably too polite to say it but the actual
accusation made against us was that we were 'gluttons and wine-bibbers'.
Choosing good food and wine seems to me about as appropriate as choosing
to listen to good music -- who would choose bad music, if they thought
hard about it? I think the problem was more about the company we kept.
Taxgatherers, publicans were not exactly pillars of Jewish society. But
I held the view -- which is still valid in the world today -- that the
centre of society is at the edge, where the outsiders gather. It is
there that most vital trends are forming -- good as well as destructive.
''To deal with human need it helps to know the needy at first hand
rather than hear about them second hand. To some extent I was an
outsider who was trying to get the inside to expand, rather than trying
to get in to the centre of power.''
Would it be wrong to portray you as a rebel?
''Only if you allow me to rebel against being a rebel. I have seen
many books about me and I think I must have a schizoid personality.
Never mind being half god-half man. I am portrayed as a guru in one and
a guerrilla in others, despite the fact you will have to search hard to
find me advocating dropping out of society or dropping bombs on anyone.
Perhaps I am too ordinary to be exciting and they have to make these
things up to make their religion seem spicy.
''I daresay I suffer from looking a bit like a sixties hippy, you know
-- flowing kaftan, thirtysomething, long hair and beard. Maybe in my
past life I look like your hymnwriter John (Bell) or that young composer
James (MacMillan) with the designer stubble who wrote music set to my
words on the cross, but if I came back I would probably be much duller
and ordinary. That's why it's pointless trying to profile me. I'm sorry
if I have disappointed you.''
May I ask one last question? It's about your relations with women. You
were unusual in promoting women to prominent roles . . .
''You've put your finger on a touchy issue. As you've said, I had many
among my disciples. Of course the list that my ''official'' biographers
compiled omitted the women, but even they couldn't stop them popping up
on every page. All my first resurrection appearances were to my women
friends. Females are most susceptible to psychic phenomena.
''The trouble was that this flew in the face of convention at the time
and even more so afterwards when that Paul fellow started his own brand
of religion. He meant well, but he undid a lot of progress by writing
all that rubbish about women keeping hats on and keeping silent -- I ask
you. It's taken a long time for all these hang-ups to be dealt with. I
like to think what would have happened if I had told Mary Magdalene how
to cut her hair and when to speak . . .''
Talking of her . . .
''I would never presume to speak for her, either. You'll just have to
make it up. Can't say that will make much of a change as far as I'm
concerned. Only one thing I ask of you. Don't say I have no sense of
humour. Can't think of anything worse in people. My friends who wrote
the gospels left that side of me out.''
At that point a door opened. A gust of wind blew through the room and
the screens toppled and lay flat on the floor. The room was empty and
silent. I was alone. Was this His little joke? I really would have to
make it up without Him.
I have returned.
Time and again, in
different forms. I
no longer have the
need to be human
I often used paradox in my teaching, but never coded signals

LOTHIAN'S social work chief last night moved to quell fears over the
proposed closure of a Midlothian hospital for the mentally handicapped.
The region's director of social work, Mr John Chant, stressed that the
90 patients at St Joseph's Hospital in Rosewell, near Edinburgh, would
continue to be cared for by a dedicated team of nuns and staff, but in a
community setting.
The council, which assumes responsibility for the care of the learning
disabled in the region in June, plans to close the home by the turn of
the century when it implements a care in the community plan later this
year.
The move is part of an overall strategy designed to return the
handicapped to the community.
The programme which the region intends to follow has been initiated by
the St Vincent de Paul nuns who care for patients and the independent
hospital's management trust, said Mr Chant. He predicted the hospital
would close completely within three to four years.
He said none of the patients would be thrown out on the street and no
jobs would be lost.
''That is absolutely out of the question. Everybody will have a full
assessment of their needs. That assessment will be carried out by a
multi-disciplinary team of people to ensure patients are provided with
the services they require 24 hours a day.
''For many of the patients it will mean that they will be living in
ordinary houses in groups of four or five with 24-hour staff
supervision,'' he said.
Mr Chant said the move would cost more than the existing service --
and would create employment.
No-one was available for comment last night from the hospital or its
management executive.
A small group of relatives said they were unhappy about the move and
would be considering legal action to prevent the closure.

Clothes encounters: Anvar Khan investigates whether Easter is still a
traditional family event
THERE are occasions when the bond between parent and child are put to
the test. The first lie, the first curfew, the first unsavoury beau, all
conspire to polarise the first generation from the second. Christmas and
Easter, too, it seems, put a certain pressure on the family
relationship.
In both instances a religious message is symbolised by a vast material
one. True meanings are lost in a frenzy of arm-tugging as weans drag
mums and dads towards the twinkling silver wrappers and pink and gold
birthday bows of a hundred ostrich eggs sitting pretty on supermarket
shelves.
Parents don't want to deny their kids anything, but any stand against
commercialism has huge moral implications. Will they feel left out? Will
their playmates tease them if they don't get an egg? Is it preferable to
accept the fact that all children want to be equal, which means having
the same?
There are two traditions associated with the celebration of Easter:
not only of exchanging eggs, but the older habit of buying children
clothes, not chocolate. It is a dwindling commitment, mostly practised
by the working class, passed on from generation to generation.
If Christmas and winter are a time of remembrance, then spring and
Easter are a time of joy. Three women with young families explain how
they feel about a time when they are supposed to be happy.
* Susan Grieve, 23, an administrative assistant, is a single parent.
Her son Craig is seven years old and a big Hibs fan.
''The first thing I ever bought Craig for Easter was a sailor's outfit
when he was four months old. My strongest memory of Easter as a child is
of getting eggs and rolling them down Arthur's Seat; of looking up and
seeing different coloured paper from all the eggs. I always got new
clothes for Easter. We did a lot of visiting so I needed new clothes for
that.
My mum always has the family up and makes a big buffet. My father and
his brother go down to the pub and the food's out by the time they come
back. This is the chance when we can all be together. We all bring food
-- I bring a gateaux or something.
I try my hardest to get a chocolate Easter egg. I'd be disappointed if
I didn't get one. But I can eat Craig's. He gets about 14. Mum sometimes
gets me a box of Roses. I'd buy myself clothes but I buy something every
week.
Craig's not a chocolate eater so I get him what he needs. This year I
got him some cream jeans, brown sandboots, a navy blue polo shirt, a cap
and a waistcoat to match.''
* Jennifer Alexander, 26, is an assistant manageress and a married
mother of three.
''Sarah-Jane will be 10 in October, Nicole is five this year and
Nathan will be four on Christmas Eve. The kids know what Easter's about
but we don't go into it that much. They know the stone got rolled away
from the tomb and that Jesus rose again. They know the true meaning of
Christ; they get it at school. I'm a spiritualist, I go every Sunday,
but I wouldn't impose that on anyone.
Everyone buys kids eggs, don't they? I buy them clothes. Mum gets them
shoes. My sister usually asks me if I need anything for the kids, like
socks or knickers. Sarah-Jane got earrings this year. They all get the
same money spent on them. If one's needier than the others we make it up
to them one way or another.
I think Easter is getting way out of hand, like Christmas. You've
always got to spend too much money. We're a young family but we get what
we can afford. Some people buy something expensive and we've been skint
to get something decent, but we're not going down that road again.
If the kids are not happy, well, tough. If we can't afford, they don't
get. Those adverts for LA Lights trainers and Reebok: if a child hadn't
seen them they would't be longing for a pair. But ours do well.
Everybody gets togged up and sits stuffing their face and we go out
and roll their eggs. I used to love painting the boiled eggs as a wee
girl, and getting yours better than everyone else's. I liked the boxes
with big ribbons; they were really appealing. At Easter everyone was
nice to each other. There was no arguing.''
* Michelle Knox, 25, is an optical assistant, and the mother of
one-year-old Greg.
''My family never really celebrated Easter. They were not particularly
religious. This is Greg's first Easter. Last year he was only a tiny wee
thing but he still got a few presents. This year he will too, probably,
but there'll be no big meals or celebrations. We'll probably pop over to
see my husband David's parents, but we'll spend most of the day on our
own.
I think Easter is a bit old-fashioned. This year we'll spend #10 or
#15 on Greg, but that's probably too much. We're going away for a week
so we'll probably get him new stuff for that. When I was young I enjoyed
going to Sunday School at Easter, but I don't know if Greg will be that
kind of person. I'll explain what Easter is about to him, but I don't
agree with buying kids presents every year. They'll be looking for
things all the time.
Easter gets more expensive. I have to think what's more important, and
save a present for another occasion, like a birthday. The family spoil
Greg. He's too young to appreciate it. I'm not really happy about him
getting chocolate because it's bad for his teeth. I've put the eggs he's
got already on the top shelf so he can't see them.
My husband is a foreman painter and decorator. If someone said to me
on Sunday, 'Let's go out and roll eggs' I would; it'd be exciting for
Greg. But David'll probably be working. That's how important Easter is
to us.''
EASTER HIT PARADE
* THE term Easter is derived from the Anglo Saxon goddess, Eostre.
Traditionally commemorating the ''rebirth'' of Christ and timed to
coincide with the ''rebirth'' of spring, Easter is pertinent to Eostre,
who was the Goddess of Dawn, and therefore associated with the rebirth
of each day. Since the beginning of time the egg has been the ultimate
symbol of new beginnings.
* THE renowned Easter bunny can be traced back to the late seventeenth
century, when he made his first appearance in a German fable book,
laying Easter eggs and hiding them in the garden.
* CONSECRATED eggs were used by Christians during Easter church
ceremonies until the fourth century when eggs became forbidden during
Lent. With spring being the peak laying season for hens, an overflow of
eggs resulted and people took to hard boiling the surplus, decorating
them in bright colours and presenting them to children as Easter gifts.
* CREME-FILLED eggs first appeared in 1923.

THE tycoon's wife whose battered body was found on a country roadside,
might have been murdered in her home 150 miles away, detectives said
yesterday.
The woman was identified by her ex-husband as Mrs Alena Link, wife of
wealthy Birmingham property owner Martin Link, who poisoned himself four
days after her body was discovered by a farmworker in Middletonon the
Wolds, Humberside.
West Midlands police said Mrs Link, 53, had died from repeated blows
to her head, possibly from a blunt instrument.
A post-mortem examination revealed she had been dead for up to 48
hours before her body was found. Detective Superintendent Bruce Gilbert,
who is leading the investigation, said it was possible she was murdered
at home.
Tufts from a red carpet have been discovered at the couple's house in
Edgbaston, Birmingham, and police believe the carpet, which has not been
found, may have been used to cover the body when it was moved.
Mr Gilbert appealed for information about Mrs Link's movements between
April 2, the day she was last seen alive, and April 5, the day before
the body was found.
He also urged anyone who finds a bloodstained carpet or blunt
instrument to come forward.
Earlier, Mrs Link's first husband, Robin Plaice, travelled to Hull
with their 19-year-old son Joseph, to identify the body.
The death of 49-year-old Mr Link -- who left suicide notes to his
81-year-old father, Mr Plaice, and his stepson Joseph, in which he
warned ''something terrible had happened'' -- sparked a hunt for his
wife by police.
She had not been seen at her home for two weeks but her family had not
reported her missing to police.
It is known the couple had a rocky marriage and spent a month apart
around Christmas. However, Mrs Link, who had dual British and Czech
nationality and was a Quaker, returned to her husband in January.
An inquest revealed he had killed himself after drinking a mixture of
lemonade and anti-freeze.

It might not always go down well, but enlightened culinary criticism
can sharpen the tongue. CATHERINE BROWN previews the Scottish Food Proms
THE croissant was third-rate, the filling inedible and the cost
outrageous. So opined Mitzie Wilson, editor of BBC Good Food. What was
the point of handing out food awards (she had been invited to judge the
food awards at the 1994 Scottish Food Proms) when the snack lunch which
she had just eaten in Princes Square rated a zero minus?
Her jibe, made during the chefs' conference at the proms, hit a
vulnerable area, but it also provoked a kickback from the chefs. So
what. Go to any other country in Europe, even France, and you can also
suffer lousy food at over the top prices. Nowhere in the world can you
expect a 100% guarantee of good food. Ms Wilson was just unlucky.
Spirited defences of Scotland's culinary reputation have taken a
number of turns in the last decade, not least in the food proms, which
started four years ago in Perth and last year moved to Glasgow.
Cooking, eating and talking about food, the programme of events widens
again this year to include more food tastings, more cookery
demonstrations, more exhibitions, more dinners, more food maps from
schools, more conferences for professionals and more special events --
all defending the Scots ability to reject a bad-value-for-money
croissant.
From their beginnings in Perth, the proms have set out to challenge
all palates. ''There is no point,'' says Brian Hannan, proms organiser,
''celebrating gourmet meals in prestigious restaurants cooked by
Michelin-starred chefs, when children in schools are ignorant of the
prime-quality ingredients which are produced in their own back yard.''
He is encouraged by those schools who have taken up the idea of
illustrated food maps. Copying last year's resource pack on Scottish
food, which was sent out to schools in the Strathclyde region, the idea
this year was extended to the rest of Scotland. The challenge: to make a
pictorial food map or collage which contained all the natural food
resources in their correct place of origin.
Not all teachers knew all the answers. Do you know where a Stichill
cheese comes from? Windsor MacGilvray's teachers at Coltness High School
in Wishaw didn't, so he tried a Glasgow deli. He eventually tracked it
-- with the help of the Real Cheese Company in East Kilbride -- to a
farmhouse just outside Kelso where Brenda Leddy makes the Cheshire-type
cheese using the milk from her herd of Jersey cows.
Home economics departments in 100 schools around Scotland have
produced maps which will be on display at the Sauchiehall Street Centre
throughout the food proms. A panel of judges will choose the best dozen
and the winners will be invited to a schools gourmet lunch -- cooked by
Michelin-starred chefs -- in the Glasgow Hilton.
While the maps have taken the fun approach to discovering Scottish
ingredients, the next step, says Hannan, is to encourage young cooks to
start cooking more adventurously with Scottish ingredients. New this
year, there will be five cookery workshops for school pupils at the
Glasgow College of Food Technology.
Next year, Hannan would like to see link-ups between the schools and
the local hotels or restaurants where their maps are displayed, and some
of the best young cooks are invited to take part in a cooking class.
His challenge to the professionals in the food industry, notorious for
jealously guarding their secret ways with food, is to tempt them to
exchange their culinary knowledge and expertise more freely, not just
with the young, but with everyone, including their competitors.
There is no need to worry about plagiarism. Give 100 chefs the same
ingredients for the same recipe and they will produce 100 different
results: which is why they are so fascinating to watch at work.
Those successful Scottish chefs who have established their own
original style will demonstrate at the Glasgow College of Technology
some of the dishes which Hannan has collected and edited as The Flavour
of Scotland: The Best of Scottish Cooking. Other food book authors will
also demonstrate their individual styles, and at the Hospitality Inn
there will be a series of demonstrations on the art of sugar craft and
cake decoration.
For hedonistic eaters who would rather be cooked-for than cook, the
choice on the menu is rich and scintillating. For the 12 days of the
proms, a dozen restaurants will be preparing special meals.
Two of them -- The Brasserie, West Regent Street, and Pizza Express in
Queen Street -- will have a live performance of Chris Ballance's play,
Sweet Fancy: an amusing entertainment about a woman's inner thoughts and
torments on what -- or what not -- to cook for dinner.
At the Glasgow Hilton there are seven special dinners including a
''meal-of-the-year'' gala dinner, and the first home economics dinner on
Saturday, April 22 after the first one-day home economics conference.
Other Hilton dinners celebrate the Scottish Food Awards and the Scottish
Chef Awards.
There's more fun for hedonists is at Stravigin in Gibson Street, where
a series of tutored food tastings by experts will take place. Taste and
criticise from a selection of venison and game, seafood, bread, cheese,
wine and chocolate, and when the tastebuds need a rest there are the
exhibitions.
The food maps have already been mentioned. There is also a
photographic food exhibition at Glasgow School of Art, a recipe and menu
display at the Mitchell Library and a display of ceramic tableware by
Karen McDonald at the Ubiquitous Chip in Ashton Lane.
Other non-eating, non-cooking events include a film at the GFT, TV
chefs from Fanny to Floyd, a Scottish food lecture in Whiteinch library
and two guided restaurant tours: one on foot round the West End and one
by coach round the city centre.
And if, in the course of your eating and seeing promenades around the
city, you happen to be served up a lousy, over-priced croissant, or
anything else for that matter, in danger of giving Scottish food a bad
name -- complain. Not to a gathering of chefs afterwards, but
immediately to the manager of the restaurant.

Herald on April 29.

HOMES were evacuated last night as a grass fire swept along the Solway
coast at Colvend, five miles south of Dalbeattie.
Several houses in the village of Portling were slightly damaged and
residents were led to safety as flames on a three-quarter mile front
were fanned by a strong wind.
More than 20 firefighters were joined by volunteers to try to keep
30ft-high flames from reaching the houses.
People were allowed back into their houses later as the fire continued
along the coastal walks and footpaths.
The firefighters were hampered by the remoteness of the area, where
cliffs rise to 150ft above the Solway Firth.
A fire brigade spokesman said: ''Houses were in danger at one stage as
the flames spread quickly. Everything is tinder dry.''

A HOMELESS man was shot dead as he fled along a city street early
yesterday. Mr Terry Farrimond, 26, was hit at least three times in
Castleway, Salford, Greater Manchester.
He was hit in the head, chest, and abdomen and was dead on arrival at
Hope Hospital. Mr Farrimond was on his mountain bike when he was
approached by several men near garages.
Mr Farrimond -- who was homeless -- left the home of relatives in
Pendlebury, Greater Manchester, at midnight and was shot 15 minutes
later.
Detective Superintendent Bill Roberts said: ''The victim dropped his
bike near the garages and was fleeing when he was shot.
''A witness saw one gunman shoot him but there may have been more than
one gunman. A dark-coloured 4X4 off-road vehicle we believe was involved
was seen leaving,'' the officer added.
Former soldier Bill Curran tried to save Mr Farrimond. ''I heard three
or four shots and found the lad lying face down. He had been shot three
times -- in the chest, abdomen, and back of the head.
''I cleared his airways and managed to get a pulse. I stayed until an
ambulance crew arrived and worked on him for 20 minutes,'' Mr Curran
said.

THE ashes of the late Sir Charles Irving, former MP for Cheltenham,
are to be air dropped over the town together with those of his twin
sister.
Executors have disclosed it was Sir Charles's wish that both sets of
ashes be scattered over the Gloucestershire town from an aircraft.
Sir Charles, a bachelor who died of cancer last month, aged 71, kept
the ashes of his sister Tibby Irving following her death in Canada in
1992.
The double air drop will be carried out over a non-residential area
using a special container attached to a parachute.
However, the instructions in his will about the disposal of his ashes
have led to protests from some residents.
Sir Charles was Tory MP for Cheltenham for 18 years until his
retirement in 1992.

MONTY PYTHON fans among Couch Potato's readers may remember a sketch
about the philosophy faculty of the University of Wooloomooloo -- an
upstanding body of manly Australian thinkers whose guiding principle, as
enshrined within rules one, four, and upwards of the faculty code, was:
No Poofters.
Now the Python team never were very kind to our antipodean cousins --
it took Australian wine exports a while to get over being mocked as
Chateau Chunder -- but it must be admitted that there is indeed a strain
of robust masculinity in the national character that recoils from the
merest suggestion of effeminacy like Naomi Campbell from a typewriter.
According to Banjo Patterson, Australia's national humorist and author
of Waltzing Matilda, the strong, silent sheepshearers of the Outback
frowned even upon marriage. Any bloke who wanted to keep such close
company with a sheila had to be a bit of a sissy.
Yet despite all that, or perhaps because of it, some of Australia's
big cities have a gay culture as flamboyant and lively as the front rows
of a Shirley Bassey concert. And it's the collision between the two that
makes Stephan Elliott's The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert
(rental, cert 15) such a brave, big-hearted, and funny little film. A
road movie/MGM musical/self-discovery drama/low-camp comedy about three
Sydney drag queens on their way across the Outback in a rickety old
school bus to play a four-week cabaret engagement in Alice Springs, it
combines all the outrageous, bitchy humour of traditional camp with a
wry, quirky sensibility about gender and sexuality that transcends the
comfortable stereotypes of Gays In The Movies.
Terence Stamp (an astonishingly good
smile-though-your-heart-is-breaking performance against type), Hugo
Weaving, and Guy Pearce (out of Neighbours) are Bernadette, Mitzi, and
Felicia, the jocks in frocks with a bus full of attitude, and their
progress to Alice through the eerily photographed desert takes in
several stops along the way for the purposes of various enlightening
encounters with the local rednecks, not to mention an opportunity to
stand on top of Ayers Rock and lip-synch to Gloria Gaynor's I Will
Survive. Elsewhere, Bernadette proves that drag queens are no sissies
when she drinks a smalltown drinking champ off his stool. The really
memorable image of the film, however, is that of the lavender-coloured
bus (it's the character called Priscilla, since you ask) flying through
the inhumanly beautiful Australian desert as the girls sit on the top
singing, like Busby Berkeley showgirls on the wing of an aeroplane,
their silver lame trains flying behind them in the slipstream like flags
of freedom.
As with most road movies, however, the travel is more fun than the
arriving. Once in Alice Springs, Bernadette and Mitzi and Felicia start
sorting out their troubled lives in cosily predictable fashion: one
finds love, another comes to terms with his son, etc; for such a
defiantly gay movie, all this sort of thing strikes Couch Potato as
rather disappointingly normal. What's not disappointing at all, though,
is the show the girls put on at the club, a gloriously corny
song-and-dance spectacle (featuring gay and kitsch pop anthems like The
Village People's Go West, Abba's Mama Mia, and Charlene's I've Never
Been To Me) that makes it easy to see why the film's costume designers
picked up an Oscar. Tremendous fun.
Equally camp in its own sweetly dated way, though Jack Regan and
George Carter probably wouldn't thank you for saying so, is the 1970s
Euston Films TV cop series The Sweeney, a feast of shooters, brasses,
snouts, flared trews, and tasty motors that, in the way of the British
film industry in those days, made the transition to the big screen in
1976's Sweeney! and 1978's Sweeney Two, both now available on one tape
at #10.99 from Lumiere Pictures -- cert 18, natch.
Less humorous and more violent (which means very violent) than the TV
series, but benefiting from bigger budgets and more opened-out
storylines, John Thaw and Dennis Waterman's finest hours stand up
surprisingly well against acknowledged British thickear classics of the
period like Get Carter. But oh dear . . . those clothes. A Priscilla
glamour makeover would do George and Jack the world of good.

The Herald reviewers' guide to listening pleasure
Jazz Juice 2, various (Streetsounds)
* FOR once the Streetsounds moniker is somewhat misleading. Lou Rawls
oozing his way through The Girl From Ipanema? The cool slinkiness of
Peggy Lee's Fever? The smoky mellowness which characterises Wild Jack
Adams' version of Hit The Road Jack? Heck, these ain't gritty street
sounds . . . these be avenue sounds, sweaty but sedate -- and as such,
they are the perfect trigger for mildly-frenzied afternoons of improper
suburban shimmying around the conservatory. Imbibe some Cerveza with
Boots Brown and his Blockbusters! Ditch the lawnmower, and instead get
your mojo working with Jimmy Smith! And if you get into Lonnie Liston
Smith's groove, it's Mardi Gras from Milngavie to Morningside!
Strictly Rhythm: The Fourth Album, various (Strictly Rhythm)
* RUMP-BUMPING collection of 12 of the New York label's singles from
the past year, categorised as current big chunes, recent past classics,
or modern rarities. Most of them have been assembled by sundry stellar
Strictly Rhythm names, including Armand Van Helden (Witch Doktor),
George Morel (Unnecessary Changes and Get Up And Get Soulful), Satoshi
Tomiie (creator of The Theme under the guise of Loop 7), and Louie Vega
and Kenny Gonzales (producers of Sole Fusion's The Chosen Path). Another
highlight is provided by Androgeny's camp corker Let's Talk About Me.
Talk about value for money . . .
I'll Manage Somehow, Menswear (Laurel)
* DEBUT single by London's latest media-sweeties, due in Glasgow at
King Tut's on Thursday and Edinburgh's Belle Angele on Friday. Does the
world really need a Cockney glam-Jam revival? For the answer, look
carefully at my boat-race. It displays no signs of being Ronnie Kray
(rhyming slang for ''happy and gay''). If you ask me, guv, Menswear are
Moss Bros (a dead loss).
Born Sandy Devotional; In The Pines; Calenture; The Black Swan;
Stockholm, all by the Triffids (Mushroom)
* A WELCOME CD re-promotion of the now-defunct Australian
baroque'n'rollers four studio albums, plus one live effort, recorded
between 1986 and 1990. If you don't have them on vinyl already, you
should know that the Triffids were kinda Springsteenesque in a
broodingly epic country-rock way, only more human-sized, more
finely-detailed and altogether much more useful. Anything else you
should know? In The Pines cost $1190 to record, $340 of which was spent
on beer. Oh -- and keep your eyes peeled for the ongoing works of
chief-Triffid David McComb.
DAVID BELCHER
Au Theatre des Champs-Elysees, Michel Petrucciani (Dreyfus)
* TWO CDs and 100 minutes of solo piano par excellence from the
diminutive French genius, much of which may be familiar from his recent
Scottish concerts -- if not, make it so, and soon. Petrucciani plays
with such vigour, both physically and intellectually, that his original
reworkings of standards such as the wittily energetic Take The A Train
can leave you all but drained, but smiling, too, and never, ever cold.
Live 1994, Pentangle (Hypertension)
* WITH only guitarist Bert Jansch and singer Jacqui McShee remaining,
long gone are not only three of the original line-up but also that
band's admirably relaxed and loose intertwining of folk, jazz, and
blues. The nineties approach is efficient folk-rock and best when
understated, as on the old fave Cruel Sister, but too often becomes
heavy-handed or abrupt, leaving McShee's singing the sole provider of
any character.
ROB ADAMS
Shostakovich Symphonies 1 and 6 (Berlin Classics)
* BLIMEY. Some time back I reviewed the great Kurt Sanderling's
recording on this label of Shostakovich's Fifth with the Berlin Symphony
Orchestra. It was one of the most stunning I'd heard. Ditto this disc,
from the same series. Sanderling brings an intensity and insight to
these symphonies, recorded between 1979 and '83, that will raise
eyebrows; and the playing of the BSO is of a ferocious commitment. Not
only did Sanderling know Shostakovich intimately, he was inside his
head; hear this and believe.
Prokofiev/Scriabin; The Mravinsky Collection (Russian Disc)
* COLLECTOR'S pieces here from 1959. Old, live, and not too brilliant
recordings they may be, but devotees of Evgeny Mravinsky, the dictator
and determining voice in fashioning the sound of the Leningrad
Philharmonic Orchestra, will want them anyway. Prokofiev's Sixth
Symphony and Scriabin's ear-bursting Poem of Ecstasy receive inimitable,
scorching performances. Sod the scratches, hear the sear.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
Oliver! (Showtime!)
* THIS low-price label obviously realises that it's not worth paying
more than #4.99 for the CD of a musical when you're going to drown out
the show's stars with your own renditions of the numbers. The tunes in
Oliver! defy you not to singalong with the National Symphony Orchestra.
While the chorus numbers (Food Glorious Food and Consider Yourself
particularly) are rousing, Oliver (Richard South)'s solos tend towards
the wobbly. Julian Forsyth, however, provides a fine Fagin -- on top
form on Be Back Soon and You've Got To Pick A Pocket Or Two.
Pal Joey (Showtime!)
* DENIS Lawson and Sian Phillips are two of the voices on this 1981
recording of the Rodgers and Hart show. This time, solo numbers trump
ensemble pieces; Lawson's I Could Write A Book and Phillips' Bewitched,
Bothered and Bewildered being especially enjoyable. Lorenz Hart's
mischievous sense of humour is evident throughout; not least in the song
detailing the thoughts of a stripper as she works -- Zip. ALISON KERR

As VE-Day approaches, Jennifer Cunningham examines
the ways in which authors use the Second World War
asa setting for a range of stories, including that of
Anne Frank before the young girl was forced into hiding
IT IS not just adults who are remembering war and all its works as the
fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War approaches. The
range of war-related titles for children, both new titles and new
editions, is astonishing.
Anne Frank Beyond the Diary (Ruud van der Rol and Rian Verhoeven,
Puffin, #6.99) will no doubt be on every school library's list, but will
also appeal to children who have read the diary and want to know more
about its author. It is a generously-illustrated, simply-told biography
that allows the reader to put the diary into the context of the life
Anne had before the family went into hiding. It is the faded photographs
in which Otto Frank, Anne's father, recorded the family milestones --
the new-born Anne with her grandmother, the toddler with her sister
Margot, days at the beach -- which bring home the ordinary happiness
that was so brutally destroyed. Well-documented, with plenty of graphics
as well as photographs, this is an excellent background to any junior
understanding of the Holocaust.
The Real Plato Jones (Nina Bawden, Puffin, #3.99) is fiction with a
wartime background. That formula put Bawden on the school text list with
Carrie's War (Hamish Hamilton, #10.99; Puffin, #3.50) and Plato Jones
looks a good bet to follow. Half-Greek, half-Welsh, the grandson of a
war hero, on a visit to Greece, discovers the truth not only about his
family but about himself. A thought-provoking read for the over-10s.
Cuckoo in the Nest (Michelle Magorian, Methuen, #11.99) examines the
difficulties of rebuilding family relationships in the aftermath of war.
Magorian's own theatrical background furnishes this tale of a would-be
young actor's determination to get into the theatre with fascinating
behind-the-curtain details of stage management that give weight and pace
to an otherwise lightweight account of the age-old struggle between
father's dominance and son's self-determination. A solid and satisfying
read for the over-12s.
See Ya, Simon (David Hill, Puffin, #3.50). A low-key story of
friendship between two teenage boys who share school friends,
role-playing games, and very ordinary teenage lives, except that Simon
has muscular dystrophy and does not have long to live. Funny and direct
as well as sensitive and moving, it takes a very clear look at the
effect of disability, not only on the sufferer but all those around him.
It escapes mawkish sentiment by a generous dose of humour and a
refreshingly direct onslaught on the inability of the able-bodied to
treat the disabled as equals. An inspirational one for the over-10s
Matt's Million (Andrew Norriss, Hamish Hamilton, #9.99). A cheque for
#1,227,309.87p drops out of the blue into Matt's life -- his earnings
from a computer game he invented while he was ill. Spending it is more
difficult than he imagines. A timely tale for young people suffering
from lottery fever, it offers fun and fantasy (being chauffeur-driven to
school in a Rolls-Royce) as well as insight. Having lots of money is
extremely useful, but spending it is beset by difficulties -- and
something as simple as buying your best pal a bike can almost ruin a
friendship. Despite the moral correctness, it is a jolly fantasy for the
8-11s.
Meteorite Spoon (Philip Ridley, Puffin, #3.99). Mr and Mrs Thunder are
permanently at war. In an attempt to help her little brother cope,
10-year-old Filly records their strife and catalogues the damage to
household objects in The Book of Arguments. Life is transformed by a
strange and magical spoon. There are no new stories under the sun, but
this a compellingly-told fairy-tale for the 8-10s in a cynical and
stressful age.
The Dreamfighters and Other Creation Tales (Ted Hughes, Faber and
Faber, #10.99).  God is still creating the world, ordering the Angels to
make the insides of things and the Demons to make the outsides in this
glorious mix of folk-tales, Old Testament thunder, mischievous humour,
and poetry with some very recognisable Hughes metaphors. Man reports to
Woman his first encounter with the first fox (who is more than he
seems): ''It said: O Man, O husband of glorious and beautiful Woman, it
is the fear of being anyone's pet that has turned the tip of my tail
quite white.'' This is a collection for everyone, including those still
being read to and those doing the reading.
Marmalade Atkins on the Ball (Andrew Davies, Dutton, #9.99).
Marmalade is a very bad girl. The third in this series follows the
outrageous rebel into the world of boys' football. Already expelled from
a succession of schools, the subversive and irrepressible Marmalade soon
shows this new set of rule-makers who's boss. Every revolting child over
the age of eight will adore it.

Anne
Johnstone
embarks
on an
unusual
nature trail
LAST year more than 7000 children's books were published in the United
Kingdom. Faced with figures like that, you wouldn't think there were any
growth areas left, would you? Wrong.
Once upon a time non-fiction for tiny tots was unimaginative and
lacklustre. Today the opposite prevails as publishers vie with each
other (and presumably the telly) to bring the joy and terror of the
natural world within the grasp of the under-eights.
In 1994 Random House launched their non-fiction imprint Riverswift.
Their latest offering, Creepy Crawlies (#9.99) by Jinny Johnson, takes a
magnifying glass to various unwelcome house guests, from spiders to
cockroaches. So if you've ever wondered how flies hang upside down from
the ceiling, or a flea can jump 200 times its own body length, now read
on. As usual, it is the astonishing graphics which make this book leap
out at you and as usual, the artists involved receive only the most
cursory mention. (Age 4+).
Some of the best junior non-fiction stands on the cusp between art and
science. A Ruined House by Mick Manning, in the Walker Books Read and
Wonder series (#7.99), occupies this territory beautifully. Manning
illustrates his own text, producing a rare harmony between the two.
Because this lovely book is so full of his feelings about his subject,
kids absorb facts without realising it.
This book works on several levels. It is beautifully produced in every
detail from the moody watercolours of bats and crumbling gable ends, to
the carefully chosen typeface (Caslon Antique) and calligraphy. It works
because of the sparse eloquent text, typical of an illustrator who knows
that his pictures do most of the work. It works because you expect the
tale of a disintegrating house to be sad (which in human terms it is)
but this is not a story about us, but them -- bats, butterflies, barn
owls, beetles, and bees. Most of all it works because Manning manages to
convey that this is a special secret place for him and we are only
invited in on sufferance. Come and share this with me, he seems to be
saying, but do not disturb. (Age 4+).
Night Becomes Day by Richard McGuire (Viking, #9.99) takes us on a
different journey. Using a stream of consciousness techniques and bold
simplified graphics redolent of French Art Deco travel posters from the
1920s, he moves us from dawn to dusk. As in the Meg and Mog books, the
surprising colour combinations on each page (e.g. pink sky, purple
trees, followed by cream sky, red earth) help keep it fresh and lively.
(Age 3+).
Another transformation is the subject of Brian Wildsmith's The Easter
Story, now out in the OUP miniature series (#3.99). You wouldn't think
Wildsmith's lavishly detailed illustrations with loads of gold, would
convert well to this format but they do, thanks to a quality printing
job. As with his Nativity, Wildsmith's version of the Crucifixion and
Resurrection are told through the eyes of a donkey, the donkey. (Age
4+).
The word Misoso, from the language of the Mbundu tribe of Angola,
describes stories told for entertainment. That is what characterises a
new anthology of African folk tales of that name retold by Verna Aardema
(Hamish Hamilton, #12.99). The stories are arranged geographically, so
you can take an armchair African safari starting in Sierra Leone, going
down the West Coast to South Africa, then up to Zanzibar through a dozen
different cultures. These tales invite you to sit around a camp fire and
listen to a master storyteller. I especially liked The Boogey Man's
Wife, a morality tale from Liberia with a feminist twist. These stories
are full of the wit and colour of Africa, and the characteristic rhythm
and symmetry of folk tales the world over. One quibble. All these
countries are bursting with beautiful artwork and artists on the
breadline, so why pay an American art professor to do the illustrations?
(Age 5+).
For the younger age group, the enduring worldwide appeal of Beatrix
Potter must make her one of Britain's most valuable invisible earners.
Imaginative reworkings of the original illustrations help Frederick
Warne and Co to retain a strong place in a very competitive market.
Their latest offering for two to six-year-olds, Peter Rabbit's ABC 123
(#7.99), uses a large format to show off to good effect lots of detail
rather lost in the traditional little books.
Scotland's best recent literary export in the junior category has got
to be Mairi Hedderwick's Katie Morag. These scenes from Hebridean life,
seen through the eyes of the postmistress's perceptive daughter, have
gone all over the world and each new volume is eagerly awaited by
children and parents alike. Though Hedderwick admits she finds the books
daunting and difficult, on account of the mass of detail that has to be
transcribed from one to the next (any tiny discrepancy is eagerly picked
up by KM experts), each books exhibits a cheerful exuberance.
Keen followers must have been wondering when wedding bells would toll
for Granny Mainland, she of the Barbara Cartland long lashes and blue
rinse, and bashful lovesick crofter Neilly Beag. (Thanks to Beag, the
phrase ''But my, you're a fine wee Bobby Dazzler'' has gone right round
the world.) Wait no longer. In Katie Morag and the Wedding (Bodley Head
#8.99) the knot is finally tied. Better still, the mysterious figure of
Grandad Island, whom most of us assumed had been driven to an early
grave by romper-suited, tractor-driving Granny Island, makes a surprise
appearance from a heavenward direction. Well up to the usual standard.
(Age 4+).
Australian writer Margaret Mahy also uses humour to reach her young
audience. In her latest, The Rattlebang Picnic (Hamish Hamilton, #8.99),
a large family of red-headed McTavishes set off in their ancient
disintegrating car for what appears to be an ideal picnic spot. Nobody
seems surprised when Granny's pizza is so tough that no one can eat it.
They all seem doomed when a volcano erupts and a wheel falls off the
car, until the McTavishettes remember the leftovers. What a pizza luck
(Age 4+).

Elaine C Smith, actress and comedian, describes a working day's eating
and drinking while on tour in Aberdeen.
* WHEN you're on tour you have to start by looking after yourself. I
had a glass of mineral water at 8.30, then went down to the gym. I ran
for two-and-a-half miles then swam. Then back upstairs. It's great to
have room service to cook for you. I had a sandwich of wholemeal bread
with bacon and tomato, a cup of Earl Grey tea, another glass of mineral
water (I was knackered from running), and orange juice.
Aberdeen Zero Tolerance campaign had asked me to do a photo launch. I
did that, then went to the shops, then to His Majesty's Theatre to do an
extra voice-over for a video about access to housing. I had another
bottle of mineral water, then went across the park, read Hello magazine
or whatever, and went to the BBC to take part in The Slice at 2pm.
Left there and went to Marks &amp; Spencer and bought a little bowl of
sweetcorn, salad, and chicken in fromage fraiche, and some sweeties
(Devon toffees). Went to the pictures (the film was IQ with Meg Ryan),
ate my salad and a few sweets, and walked from there to the Wild Boar.
At about 6pm I had a potato salad and for some reason (I'm not a big
meat-eater) a home-made burger, char-grilled, with salad and a cup of
Earl Grey tea. You can't eat too much before a performance.
Did the show, then came back to the hotel at 10.30. This is the worst
time of day, when you tend to eat rubbish. But I had bread with chicken
and salad, then melon and strawberries from M &amp; S.
I had no alcohol, just a couple of Devon toffees before I went to
sleep. It wasn't too shameful a day. There were no chips.
* Elaine C Smith talked to Lesley Duncan.

SWIFT divided the Lilliputians into two factions, the Big-endians and
Little-endians. It all depended, you will remember, on which extremity
of their eggs they decapitated. Eggwise, there's a more convincing
ideological gulf between what might be termed the Faberge and Cadbury
tendencies.
Admirers of Faberge's art are lyrical about the exquisite
craftsmanship lavished on those small, inanimate, inedible objects.
Perhaps they do represent the triumph of the decorator's art as an end
in itself. Just as plausibly they could be said to reflect the ultimate
sterility of conspicuous consumption in the Czarist era.
At the other end of the financial scale (27p), Cadbury mini eggs, in
their bright wrapping of tinfoil, fulfil an aesthetic as well as
sustaining role. The moment when your teeth break through that curved
wall of milk chocolate and encounter the gooeyness of the mock-yolk must
be one of modern life's more pleasurably tactile experiences. The things
taste good, too.
Puritans may deplore the fact that Cadbury's hatch their eggs in
battery-hen quantities months before Easter. Should they not be reserved
for an Easter treat? Commercial reality has no truck with such
sentimental, quasi-religious arguments. Alas for waistlines, the taste
for these mini eggs, far from paling through over-indulgence, grows on
itself. Emotional dependency threatens. Giant chocolate eggs, garishly
boxed to attract the young or disguised as Humpty Dumpties or bunnies,
are an additional hazard for gluttons at this time of year.
But there are sophisticated alternatives. Who could resist the large
painted tin egg with Beatrix Potter scene showing Peter Rabbit eyeing
the cabbages in Mr McGregor's garden? A treat in itself without the
solid chocolate eggs inside (#4.95). A series of painted tin eggs by
Bentley's of London are rather austerely but stylishly decorated in
abstract patterns and emblems. One shows cameos of classical scenes,
with tiny Blakean and Grecian figures. These eggs would be an ideal gift
for sweet-toothed men in the family (#3.95).
A series of papier-mache eggs are gorgeously coated in jewel colours,
with themes ranging from stylised irises and peonies to birds -- wrens,
tropical cockatoos -- sitting in leafy bowers. One beauty shows a golden
swan flying with outstretched neck over a black and gold sky, its beak
and feet picked out in orange. These eggs come in two sizes. The smaller
ones are solid and nicely hand-sized (#3.95). The big ones are hollow
and stand on a black base. They could be used to secrete further
exquisite gifts for a favoured wife or girlfriend (#8.50). Solid wooden
eggs from Thailand cost a modest #1.60 each. The grain of the wood is
pleasantly visible under the staining of olive green, navy, or burnt
sienna.
A Limoges porcelain egg with delicate flowers in a midnight blue and
gilt setting conceals a tiny perfume dispenser. At #39.50, an expensive
buy unless it is definitely to the taste of the recipient. A Capodimonte
ceramic egg with moulded flowers on top costs #10.95 and would appeal
equally to small, frilly girls and their grannies. Easter ablutions
could be made the more fragrant with Bronnley soaps encased in tin eggs
with a Faberge look (#3.95).
My own choice among this clutch of decorative eggs would be a polished
marble one with lovely whorls of grey-green and white. Handsome to look
at, it could also serve as the ovoid equivalent of worry beads.
There's another possibility -- DIY decoration. Scotland's Presbyterian
tradition has not encouraged symbolic Easter rites with eggs, whether
painting them or rolling them down hills. This is rather spoilsport.
Young children enjoy painting faces or colourful patterns on eggs
(remember to hard-boil them first!). Artistic skills can be stimulated
by egg-decorating competitions in nursery or classroom.
The most imaginative competition entry I can recall (I confess to a
certain parental input) was an egg with paper streamers stuck on to a
midnight-blue sheet of cardboard with stars painted on it. This grade-3,
free-range specimen ranged through imaginary heavens as Halley's Comet.
* Tin, papier-mache, porcelain, and ceramic eggs from Past Times of
Buchanan Street, Glasgow. Wooden eggs from Wrap, 17 Stafford Street,
Edinburgh. Bronnley eggs from department stores and chemists. Polished
marble and stone eggs from Nancy Smillie, Princes Square, Glasgow.

Hidden treasures could
be lying around just
waiting to be unearthed
Liz Taylor investigates
an upsurge of interest in
the work of Clarice Cliff
TURN out your cupboards, you may be harbouring treasures unaware.
Christie's the auctioneers are offering free valuations to anyone who
takes brightly-painted pieces of Clarice Cliff pottery to them. They are
sure that hundreds of pieces are still in the possession of people who
have no idea of how much they are worth because, until recently, the
pottery was regarded as cheap and dated. Almost everyone's granny owned
a piece of Clarice Cliff.
The innovative artist designed pottery for the people and, between the
wars, her products were sold by the thousand in Woolworths for less than
6d a piece. Today, some of her cheaper lines have soared in value -- a
small ashtray might be worth around #100, a small, conical sugar sifter
could bring between #100 and #700, depending on the design painted on
them.
The craze for Clarice has been growing fast over the past five years,
and prices have soared. However, Christie's do not think they have
reached their peak yet because of the unprecedented demand from today's
collectors.
Christie's are the only auction house that holds, in their rooms in
South Kensington, London, sales devoted entirely to the popular pottery.
At its previous sale last November, more than 1500 people turned up, the
biggest crowd the rooms had ever accommodated. On that occasion, a world
record price of #12,000 was paid for a wall charger painted with a view
of Mount Etna.
The next sale takes place in London on Friday, and another is planned
for the autumn. Next week, the auctioneers are expecting around #5000
for an ornament in the shape of a couple dancing, and between #3000 and
#5000 for another wall charger painted with trees and houses.
What was special about Clarice Cliff to make her appeal so strong for
collectors today?
A working-class girl, she was born in Staffordshire in 1899 and went
to work at the age of 13, painting pottery blanks at one of the local
factories. She was talented and ambitious, however, and managed to study
sculpture at the Royal College of Art. After finishing there, she went
back to the Potteries. In 1928 she began working for Newport Pottery,
where her avant-garde style was recognised and appreciated by her boss
Colley Shorter, whom she later married.
Although she lived until 1972, her period of all-out production lasted
only for 10 years, and before the Second World War broke out she had
retired. At her peak, however, she had 500 pottery painters working for
her, and production went on for six days a week.
Cliff flooded the cheaper end of the market with her distinctive
pieces. Because she was very fond of jazz, many of her designs reflected
the popular music of her time. She even named some of her pieces Age of
Jazz, and the ornament of the dancing couple that comes up for sale on
Friday is part of that range.
These ornaments were intended to be set up beside wind-up gramophones
in suburban houses, but Christie's expert Mark Wilkinson says few have
survived because they were extremely fragile and were probably knocked
over by over-energetic dancing to the music. ''We have only ever seen
five of them,'' he said sadly.
Another influence on Clarice Cliff were designs executed by Diaghilev
for the Ballet Russe that took London by storm in the 1920s, and she
produced a series of slightly more expensive wares based on his themes.
Her more workaday pieces were painted with stylised crocuses and little
houses with smoke curling out of their chimneys, like Friday's wall
charger. The colours were always bright and eye-catching, with strong
contrasts.
One of the reasons Clarice Cliff appeals to collectors is that they
can build up collections of her designs -- with names like Age of Jazz,
Bizarre, or Fantasque -- or her patterns. She specialised in the
practical, and made vases, cruets, ashtrays, tea-sets, jam pots,
chargers, plates, and vases in a limited range of shapes. Some people
like to collect every design of one pattern, or alternatively every
pattern with the same design.
Currently, there is a big demand for sugar sifters and several are in
next week's sale, prices ranging from #100 to #700. However, sifters
painted in rare patterns can demand as much as #1800.
Since the craze got under way, there have been attempts at forgery
but, Wilkinson says, fakes are easy to spot because genuine Cliff pieces
are hard-glazed all over and fakes are usually overpainted on top of the
original glaze. A favourite way of trying to deceive is to paint an
extra pattern on the centre of a plate, which was designed only around
the rim originally. Watch out if you're buying Clarice Cliff. Check the
painting is overglazed and hard.

IT IS 14 years since Anthony Hanson, a Master of Wine and a London
wine merchant, produced his book Burgundy in the Faber Books on Wine
series. It was a fine read, combining knowledge and authority with a
critical edge whose honesty was sometimes resented in Burgundy itself.
The region's growers have been engaged in major reforms over the last
20 years, and few who love the wine will have failed to detect
improvements. Hanson notices many in this second edition. Its length has
almost doubled to 712 pages, and is up to the 1994 vintage.
Hardly anyone in Burgundy would now fail to recognise the book for
what it is, a hymn of praise for some of the world's greatest wines to
slip over throats. The first two, new, chapters certainly sing of the
wine and its two great grapes, Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, in appealing
fashion: enthusiasm is matched by common sense and recommendations for
tasting that would apply to many other wines.
All this is especially necessary in Burgundy; no wine needs harder
work if it is to be enjoyed and be fair value. Whereas in claret the
grower makes the wine and the (single) vineyard name acts as a brand
that can be depended on quite far down the price scale, there is almost
nothing comparable in Burgundy. There are some brands -- the Romanee
Conti for example -- but they are few, and ferociously expensive. There
are few single vineyards: and even great names, and great spaces, such
as Clos Vougeot, are plotted and pieced to a remarkable degree.
What matters in Burgundy is who has made the wines, from grapes grown
in tiny parcels and assembled from many cuvees. Of course, there are
exceptions, but almost everything in Burgundy is small-scale. Total
production is still little more than a tenth of Bordeaux. Almost every
wine is what Californians would describe as boutique -- small in
quantity, distinctive, and, at best, enchanting.
Hanson starts with Chablis and runs south thorugh the great areas, the
most northerly, to the less good, and then on to Beaujolais, the wine
lands of the Valois Duchy.
The chapter on Beaujolais is compelling, about a wine that is
currently encountering some broad but undeserved criticism (a reaction
to everyone's boredom with Beaujolais Nouveau). The best flavour of
Hanson's approach, however, can be tried on the just-over-20 pages
devoted to the wines of Meursaul  which match firm opinion (and notes of
opinions which differ from his own) with plenty of data. He has a lively
awareness of other tasters, and readers with doubts about the great
American guru, Robert Parker's, feel for Burgundy will find them pinned
down here.
The book is crammed with information and is an indispensable work of
reference. Those who find Burgundy's famous names unaffordable will
still want Hanson for areas like Rully and Montagny whose wines can be
had for around a tenner, and often even less.

JAZZ has always been blessed by specialist record labels where the
music has been lovingly nurtured and the musicians given licence to play
the songs they enjoy with a degree of artistic freedom.
Commodore Records under the benevolent supervision of Milt Gabler was
one. Then there was Keynote, which was owned by Harry Lim, and
Signature, which was supported by Bob Thiele. There were others, there
always have been and, hopefully, always will be.
Right now, among those who should be celebrated is Mosaic, which has
already issued a huge portion of the old Blue Note catalogue and a
magnificent three-box set which covers all the Commodores -- alternate
takes, previously unissued material, as well as the classic tracks we
knew from the thirties and forties when Gabler's dream-child was born.
Now Mosaic has moved on to plunder the vaults of the major labels who
seem reluctant, at times, to make rare sessions readily available. For
instance, there's the complete CBS Recordings of Eddie Condon and his
All Stars which provides hours of unforgettable music and a host of
equally unforgettable memories for those of us still around who can
recall the Condon Mob's invasion of Britain back in l957.
The two albums -- Jam Session Coast-to-Coast and Jammin' at Condon's
-- became anthems for those British musicians and fans who did not want
to follow the Holy Grail of New Orleans. Freddy Randall, our own Alex
Welsh, and Mick Mulligan were among those who bought the records and
assimilated the free-wheeling music without too many boundaries which
Condon and his men played at his New York club and recorded for A &amp; R
man George Avakian.
There was an informality about a Condon session which you didn't find
in the serious business of Bunk Johnson re-creations. There was fun,
there was an abundance of good music and there was, above all, taste.
It was not until they arrived here in l957 that the Condon band
realised the impact of the fifties recordings they had made. By then the
first two albums had been issued and a third, Bixieland, was also on the
shelves.
None of them has been reissued here -- only the later Roaring Twenties
album, made on their return from the British tour, has been seen in any
later guise.
Now, though, Mosaic has made them all available. Five CDs in one
package with a booklet containing pictures from the various legendary
sessions. These photographs are to be pored over and cherished -- the
incomparable Billy Butterfield, the blowsy, hard-bitten yet sentimental
Wild Bill Davison, the peerless trombone team of Cutty Cutshall and Lou
McGarity. Above all else, though, there is the music, covering just a
decade but achieving a degree of excellence in that time which few band
leaders could attain.
But there are special favourites -- on Coast to Coast, there is the
delightfully informal Jam Session Blues/Ole Miss with Condon's raucous
welcome to Johnny Mercer towards the end -- though Peanuts Hucko later
told me Mercer never did arrive, though he had been invited.
There's Butterfield's tribute version of I've Got a Crush On You
dedicated to Lee Wiley on the Treasury of Jazz album; James Jones --
yes, the author of From Here To Eternity -- roaring out approval at the
end of That's A Plenty on the Roaring Twenties.
So many memories, so many moments of magic, and bless Mosaic, are all
lovingly restored, beautifully packaged and available again.

The vicar, the music, the stern
and unfamiliar old words
invest this most important
of rites of passage
with an extra dimension
While purporting to be a
romp, the words of the
traditional marriage service
have never resonated with
such seriousness on screen
The success of a British box-office hit lies less in the froth of
comedy decorating its surface than in the
questions that poke at the ironies of the marriage
business buried beneath it. Carol Clewlow
examines the film and weddings in general
AMERICA'S favourite hero Forrest Gump may have scooped the honours at
the Oscars, leaving Four Weddings and a Funeral out in the cold as
predicted, but it doesn't really matter. Our honour is secure. For while
Forrest Gump has turned in a respectable 870% profit on its #36m
production cost, it's the British film that has really proved the
producer's dream.
Made for a ridiculously modest #4m, Four Weddings, has so far clocked
up an astonishing return of 4416% for its production company, Working
Title, to become the most successful British film ever made.
The basis of the two films make an interesting comparison -- Forrest
Gump, the archetypal American movfilm, Four Weddings, ostensibly at
least, incontrovertibly British.
The difference between them is that Forrest Gump did not travel as
well across the Atlantic, as did Four Weddings.
There is much on which to reflect, both from a monetary and moral
point of view, when comparing the merits of two of the biggest
box-office hits of the past year.The homespun picture of American life
as personified by Gump failed to strike a chord in British hearts in the
way that Four Weddings had already managed in the States.
The reason may well be the nature of the Britain portrayed in Four
Weddings, now out on video for a limited period until the end of this
month. A charming, eccentric, Disney world of stately homes and village
churches and olde English pubs, a Brigadoon, where night porters are
never churlish and instead stay up late to smile and serve you whisky in
cut glasses. Just the sort of place you'd want to take a holiday.
This Britain, too, is peopled with characters to match, a fabulously
wealthy aristocrat, charmingly self-effacing about his money, an Oscar
Wilde in a waistcoat, a real Cockney sparrow and, of course, best of
all, a deeply sexy, hopelessly inadequate British bachelor. There are no
problems with race or class in this world, nor need there be, for this
is fairyland. Instead, there is that same, careful proletarianism that
you find on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. Tom, the aristocrat,
would marry Scarlett would she have him.
No one works in Four Weddings, except Hamish the Highlands and Islands
politician whose career we can only hope survived a messy separation a
bare few months after the wedding. And why should we care about what the
characters of Tom or Gareth or Matthew do for a living? For this is not
a film about workdays, this is a film about weekends -- about Saturdays
to be precise. This is a film, indubitably, about weddings.
Indeed if, as is commonly stated, the definition of a wedding is a
public statement of a private truth, then even Gareth's funeral in some
sense becomes a wedding. For, as his partner Matthew says at the outset
of the oration: ''Gareth used to prefer funerals to weddings. He said it
was easier to get enthusiastic about a ceremony one had an outside
chance of eventually being involved in.''
The ease and affection with which Gareth and Matthew conduct their
long-term, live-in relationship is contrasted starkly in the film with
the heterosexual angst that swirls about them. But then they don't need
to worry about whether or not to wed.
As the marriage-shy Charles says in wonder at Gareth's funeral: ''All
these years when we've been single and proud of it, we never noticed
that two of us were, to all intents and purposes, married at the time.''
But, of course Charles is not single and proud of it. In fact, he's
severely embarrassed by it and terminally confused about his inability
to find a nice girl and settle down.
''What do we think about marriage?'' he asks Matthew, searching
desperately for an answer as the last few seconds tick away before his
own wedding. It might serve as a leitmotiv for the film.
For the success of Four Weddings lies less in the froth of comedy that
decorates its surface than in the disconcerting questions that poke away
at the ambiguities and ironies of the whole business of marriage buried
beneath it. It's interesting, for instance, that while the film purports
to be something of a romp, the words of the traditional marriage service
have never resonated with such seriousness on screen as they do here, or
indeed been used to such fine dramatic effect.
For if Richard Curtis's script reminds us of anything, it is that
there is something inherently dramatic about a church wedding. That the
world at large recognises this would seem to be borne out by the fact
that two-thirds of the couples who marry each year choose to do so in a
church. And it's a fair bet that if the Church of England eventually
allows those divorced to re-marry in church, then that percentage will
rise even higher.
More than half the people who choose to marry this way have no regular
church connection; rather, we instinctively feel, like the couples in
Four Weddings. Asked why they should then decide to solemnise their act
in this way, they will search around for those rarely used and unwieldy
words necessary to explain the delicate and difficult notion that
somehow the building, the vicar, the music and, most of all, the stern
and unfamiliar old words will invest this most important of rites of
passage with the extra dimension of seriousness and commitment required
on such a day.
It seems a pity in this context that Mr Bean, not so cleverly
disguised as a hapless vicar, was allowed to run riot through the film
as he dragged out a joke long past its sell-by date. It came over less
as a cheap shot than a disappointing one, the mere rehashing of an old
joke, a particularly British one, that goes to the heart of what we are,
and that says, chary as we are of poking into things which unsettle us,
we'll just go on presenting our vicars in the way we always have,
absurdly repressed and bumbling.
For there is a brash and enervating awkwardness at the brush with the
divine that those not familiar with church worship experience at
weddings. It manifests itself in simple embarrassment at kneeling in the
wrong places, or not knowing quite how to react to the news from the
vicar that what is being played out before you in white dress and
frock-coat actually signifies ''the mystical union that is betwixt
Christ and his Church'' and explaining why, with the dignity of old
words, it should not be undertaken ''unadvisedly, lightly, or
wantonly''.
It is this strange and awkward, indeed mystical, conjunction between
the secular and the religious, played out in town and village up and
down the country every Saturday, that is the essence of a church
wedding. And it needed something sharper than an over-nervous and
tongue-tied vicar to point it up. It is a conjunction that shows no sign
of diminishing in popularity. Those who feared, or even desired, that
co-habitation would move in on marriage and eventually displace it have
been disappointed.
More than half, again, of those couples who choose a church wedding
will be living together, and to all intents and purposes will already be
experiencing marriage. Yet they will choose the sombre ceremony to
formalise their union along with the rest. They will do so, according to
Woman magazine agony aunt Sue Frost, with the highest possible motives,
believing that ''they are undertaking a contract for life which they
will do their utmost to sustain''.
The interesting thing, she says, is not how many choose church as
opposed to registry office, but how few choose to get married secretly,
away from friends and relatives. The essence of a wedding for most
couples is the public commitment in front of friends whose support is
enlisted ''as a blessing of the future marriage'', the very theme, of
course, of Four Weddings.
When a piece of popular culture achieves the level of success that
Four Weddings has, then more often than not it can be seen to be more
than the sum of its parts, to have stirred something in a collective
consciousness. One in four marriages, according to the statistics, now
ends in divorce. Yet those who divorce, in the main, try again, and
neither this figure nor the acceptance and availability of cohabitation
have dimmed the desire for the marriage ceremony.
Swathed in white wedding dress at the end of Four Weddings, Henrietta,
Charles's would-be bride, stares into the mirror as the crown of flowers
is placed on her head.
''It does work, doesn't it?'' she asks, apprehensively.
She could just be referring to the head-dress. On the other hand, she
could be talking about marriage itself.

Many British children are computer-literate but there are problems
when parents try to tackle technology with them. Yvonne Wightman reports
of a scheme to help adults and their offspring get the most from
available equipment
THE Clinton administration has given serious consideration to the
possibility of supplying every home in the States with a PC and free
access to the Internet in order that American children, particularly
those from ''disadvantaged'' families, do not fall behind in the global
superhighway of information.
British children are, for the most part, very comfortable with
information technology, but in many cases it is the parents who need to
catch up with their techno-literate offspring.
The Parents Information Network (PIN) was set up in June 1994 by
Pauline Cameron, who is a teacher, lecturer, school inspector and
governor, with the objective of helping parents overcome their fear of
technology and so become better equipped at helping their children.
''I was amazed that so few opportunities were presented to me as an
adult to share this new technology with my children,'' said Pauline
Cameron. ''The crisis facing parents is one of confidence, or lack of
it. What do we buy? Is it compatible with school equipment? What can I
do or learn that will help? There seemed to be very few places that
parents could turn to for trustworthy, independent advice and support
when taking those early steps.''
Scotland now has its own branch of PIN and the Scottish co-ordinator
is Mandi Mackenzie. She said: ''Having experienced the bewildering
choice of PCs and software available to parents, together with the many
frustrations and rewards of IT, I feel it is essential that parents
should become more involved and more confident in learning about and
understanding IT. However, I know from personal experience, that without
some unbiased help, that can be a daunting prospect.
''My ambition for PIN in Scotland is to share my experiences with as
many other parents as possible, dispelling some of their fears about the
threat of IT and helping them to begin to create a valuable family
learning environment from the kitchen table.''
The PIN network is an independent organisation and membership is free.
The organisation has its own newsletter and information sheets on what
to look for when buying a computer, what software to consider and, more
importantly, what to avoid.
In PIN's first newsletter, Christina Preston of London University,
said: ''Parents must be able to keep up with computer developments or
they are in danger of missing the boat. Nor is choosing software easy as
preview is often impossible. Some of the adventures on sale are a
parent's nightmare. Most software programming teams are male so
equal-opportunity policies have been a serious casualty.
''Damsels in distress litter the caves of adolescent games. Even at
primary level, there is a problem. One program shows a blue daddy
elephant leading a pink mummy elephant to the water. No self-respecting
computer-literate female elephant would allow this disgraceful scene to
pass unremarked.'' Christina Preston added that users should zap the
offending scene, or better still, zap the male who wrote the script.
Amusing anecdotes aside, it is true that there is great concern that
the Internet, for example, is dominated by young, white, middle-class
males. Equally, less well-off families are powerless to drive down the
superhighway -- they do not have a vehicle and there is no public
transport.
PIN hopes to address many of these problems in Scotland and it wants
more dialogue between hardware and software suppliers who, it says, have
a responsibility to help educate parents who are not technically
literate. Apple Research Machines and Oxford University Press have
already joined and more links are being sought.
''Not all children have access to a computer in the home,'' said Mandi
Mackenzie, ''and not all children are in IT-rich schools. Opportunities
must be provided for the involvement of all parents through workshops
and activities in schools, through the community, in libraries, leisure
centres and high street stores.''
PIN Scotland is trying to organise its first learning day in the
Borders and needs sponsorship, funding, equipment or help of any kind.
* Companies, organisations or individuals can contact PIN by sending a
large SAE envelope to Mandi Mackenzie, Parents Information Network, IVY
Cottage, Traquair, Innerleithen, Peeblesshire, EH44 6PS.

* THE Health Education Board for Scotland has launched a CD-ROM
containing details of everything from patient-care advice to the latest
initiatives on the prevention and spread of HIV and Aids. Although it is
designed primarily for ''professional'' use, over the next year copies
will be available in hospitals, health shops, local libraries, and
community centres.
''The new CD-ROM will be the most comprehensive source of health
information in Scotland,'' said Kerr Donaldson, information services
manager at HEBS.
It is expected that, within two to three years, hundreds of thousands
of Scots will use the system to track down any health information they
require.
Copies of the CD-ROM, which will be updated three or four times a
year, are available free of charge to most organisations, community
groups, and voluntary centres. Contact Kerr Donaldson at the Health
Education Board for Scotland on 0131 447 8044.
* CONSUMER power is coming to Scotland via Opinionmeter, a new
computerised instant feedback machine that allows customers to key in
their views on the service they are receiving.
A US invention, the Opinionmeter took 22 years to develop and is now
being used by Disneyland, Hilton Hotels, and the US Postal Service. In
the UK, trials of the new product are currently running at NatWest
Banks, British Airports, and at our own Post Office Counters.
The portable stand-alone unit can handle up to 2000 responses at a
setting.
* Details from the European Licence Holder, Opinionmeter Ltd, who are
based in East Kilbride. Telephone 013552 23322.
* WHY DO some people feel pain more than others? Is it a case of mind
over matter and if that is so, could pain levels be decreased if we knew
more about the cause? These are just some of the issues that will be
covered in this week's BBC Radio Scotland programme, Between Ourselves,
Monday April 17, 9.00pm, with a repeat on Friday at noon.
And in another broadcasting development, the Department of Trade and
Industry is to co-sponsor a new series of television programmes aimed at
primary school teachers.
Called Making Sense of Science, the series will be broadcast on
Channel 4 from September. It aims to increase teachers' confidence and
understanding of science. There will be accompanying written materials
and regional teacher training workshops. Details from 0171 215 5000.

<HEADLINE>Fish war talks in Brussels break down again as Portugal puts a spanner in the works Navy hauls in Spanish trawler</HEADLINE>

A SPANISH trawler was last night arrested by the Royal Navy on
suspicion of illegal fishing, just after talks in Brussels on the North
Atlanic fish war broke down.
The fisheries vessel HMS Shetland arrested the 32-metre Chimbote
south-west of the Isles of Scilly. The trawler's crew were ''friendly
and co-operative''.
The Chimbote is being escorted back to Plymouth, where she is due to
arrive today around 4pm. There was a possibility that under-size nets
had been used.
Earlier in Plymouth there was a mass meeting of south-west fishermen
aimed at putting pressure on the Government to withdraw from the Common
Fisheries Policy.
The fishermen burned the European Union flag before the meeting, at
which a number of speakers attacked the CFP, and called for a UK
200-mile limit.
They say the CFP is loaded against their interests, and fear that
livelihoods and fish stocks will suffer because of the way foreign boats
flout the rules on nets and under-size fish.
In Brussels, the European Union failed to clinch a deal which would
have settled the fish war with Canada.
An earlier three-hour meeting proved fruitless, and was adjourned so
envoys could consult with their capitals, Reuter reported.
But after the second set of discussions, French ambassador Pierre de
Boissieu told a news conference: ''We are unfortunately not in a
position to announce complete agreement this evening.''
Agreement was blocked when Spain and Portugal refused to accept the
way the amount of Greenland halibut which EU countries is allowed to
catch off the coast of Newfoundland was shared out.
Spain and Portugal are the only two EU countries which fish the area.
Portugal threw a spanner in the works by saying that it, as well as
Spain, wanted an extra quota.
The move was entirely political -- Portugal has virtually no interest
in trawling Greenland halibut.
However, it was enough to add fresh confusion to complex talks seen as
a last-ditch attempt to avert fresh clashes between Spanish trawlers and
Canadian patrol boats.
The talks are off for the weekend. It is not known when they will
resume.
At home, the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association is balloting
its membership over whether to split from the Scottish Fishermen's
Federation, in a row over tactics in the campaign to safeguard
Scotland's fishing stocks. The main perceived threat is from Spain.
A SWFPA board meeting in Banff yesterday decided to put the question
of a split to its members, who include 500 fishermen and a dozen fish
salesmen organised in 12 branches.
The postal ballot will be completed and the result known in time for
the SWPFA's annual meeting on June 16.
The SWFPA's secretary, Mr Roddy McColl, said the board had decided to
seek the membership's views on the SFF in light of the latter's failure
to support the Save Britain's Fish campaign, organisers of yesterday's
demonstraion in Plymouth.
Mr Bob Allan, SFF chief executive, said he hoped the poll would back
the federation and avoid an intensely regrettable potential division.
There was no change in the federation's attitude to the campaign,
which he described as ''politically unachievable''.
Meanwhile, two Scottish MPs were embroiled in a row over criticism of
Peterhead fishermen by Labour's Cunninghame North MP, Mr Brian Wilson.
SNP leader Alex Salmond, whose Banff and Buchan seat includes
Peterhead, defended his constituents and wrote to Labour's rural affairs
spokesman, Dr Gavin Strang, asking if Mr Wilson's comments were in tune
with official party policy.
Mr Wilson had criticised the Peterhead fleet's conservation record and
suggested that they had plundered fish stocks off the west coast.
Mr Salmond said: ''Brian Wilson's attack on Peterhead is totally
unjustified. At a time when Scotland's fishing communities are all
facing difficulty, it is outrageous that any Scottish politician should
indulge in such divide-and-rule tactics.
''All of Scotland's fishermen have proposed practical conservation
measures to the Government but they have been rejected.
''If all that Brian Wilson has to contribute is an unwarranted attack
on Peterhead fishermen, then he should concentrate on representing his
constituents and leave the vitally important issue of the Scottish
fishing industry to MPs from fishing constituencies.''
Mr Wilson stood by his remarks. He said: ''Anyone who knows the
history of the west-coast fishing industry will recognise Mr Salmond's
indignation as entirely bogus. My comments would not provoke a ripple of
disagreement anywhere on the west coast.''
Mr Wilson said he supported a policy of regional fisheries management,
which would give local communities more control over fishing in their
own areas.

NEARLY 40 loyalist paramilitary guns have been seized at a house near
Belfast after a surveillance operation by police.
Three people were arrested when RUC officers went to the house at
Holywood, County Down. One man had been trailed from his home at Ouston,
near Chester-le-Street, County Durham.
He is understood to hold a senior post at the Royal Ordnance munitions
factory at Birtley, Tyne and Wear, several newspapers reported last
night.
He was held when police stopped his white Rover on Thursday. They then
arrested the man's brother and his wife at their house close to the
centre of Holywood, on the eastern shores of Belfast Lough.
All three were taken to Castlereagh interrogation centre and the RUC
then began a search of the house in Seaview Terrace.
Last night, senior officers confirmed that up to 40 rifles, revolvers,
and machine guns, some home-made, others dating back to the First World
War, and a few smuggled from England where they had been deactivated,
were discovered under floorboards and in the attic.
It is the largest arms discovery since the start of the IRA ceasefire
last August 31. Charges are expected within the next few days.
Metal lathes and worktop vices which police believe might have been
used to manufacture guns in a nearby garage were also taken away for
examination.
The house watched by police at Ouston was also searched but no weapons
were found, according to police in County Durham.
It is understood that the weapons could have been stockpiled by the
outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force and although security chiefs do not
believe Protestant paramilitaries were preparing to end their ceasefire
with a new terrorist offensive, this find is certain to cause the
Government deep embarrassment.
Chief Superintendent Hugh Wallace said of the Holywood seizure:
''These guns were wrapped and well preserved.
''This find is very ominous. It was the result of very good police
work and the ongoing strategy in relation to the detection of crime and
our purge in relation to the apprehension of criminals.''
Senior civil servants and Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland Office
Minister, had been having exploratory talks with representatives of the
Progressive Unionist Party, a small group with close UVF links, as part
of the developing peace process in Northern Ireland.
This agreement for discussions was based on apparent assurances by
loyalist representatives that the decommissioning of Protestant
paramilitary guns would be seriously considered. Yet the Government is
still refusing to talk to Sinn Fein at the same level.
Details of the surveillance operation that led to the arms seizure
were not disclosed but it is understood the man from County Durham had
been followed to Northern Ireland after catching a ferry to Larne,
County Antrim.
He was then trailed to his brother's home and as he prepared to park
his car, RUC officers moved in.
The weapons included First World War Lee Enfield rifles; a modern,
Russian-made high-powered AK47 rifle; revolvers -- one a tiny Derringer;
and several home-made sub-machine guns.
Security sources also confirmed that some guns, deactivated and taken
out of official circulation in England, were among those uncovered.
The search of the house will carry on and police expect to recover
more weapons. As the search continued, paving stones were lifted and
part of the garden dug up, but nothing was found.
Chief Superintendent Wallace said: ''Most of the guns were in very
good condition. We would be hopeful of finding more.''
Last night, the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist
Party, said he was now looking for police action to trace IRA guns as
well.
''All guns should be put away,'' he said. ''Let these arms be taken
over by the authorities. Let's find the tons of Semtex (explosives) as
well.
''Maybe then people will sleep easier in their beds and believe we are
heading for a real peace.''
Mr Seamus Mallon, MP for Newry and Armagh and deputy leader of the
SDLP, who is expected to have talks with loyalist representatives soon,
said the weapons find emphasised the absolute need to remove all guns
from Northern Ireland.
''It poses fundamental questions as to what was being made and what
was being stored,'' he said. ''The answers to these questions could have
relevance to the ongoing peace process.
''While arms, ammunition, and explosives are unaccounted for there
will always be fear, suspicion, and uncertainty about the future.''

THE Scottish National Party is prepared to break with tradition and
move a writ to call the Perth and Kinross by-election if the
Conservatives fail to face the electorate by Thursday, June 15 -- four
months after the death of the constituency MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn.
Although convention states that the Government has until that date to
hold the election, it is not bound by any statutory requirement and
could leave the seat unrepresented indefinitely.
If it fails to serve the writ for the by-election within the next four
weeks, it could face an unprecedented attempt by the Scottish National
Party to force its hand.
Most political commentators had forecast the by-election for April 6
-- the same date as the elections for Scotland's new unitary authorities
-- but pressure from Conservative Central Office and Tory councillors in
Perth and Kinross persuaded Prime Minister John Major to delay.
A second option for Thursday, May 4 -- the date of the English and
Welsh council elections -- has also been ruled out. With the Easter
parliamentary recess delaying the announcement of the by-election date
still further, the opposition parties have accused the Government of
''running scared''.
Under normal circumstances, the date of a by-election is set by the
party whose member formerly held the seat; it is usually held within
three to four months following that member's death or resignation. In
the case of Perth and Kinross, June 15 is the final Thursday in the
four-month span from Sir Nicholas Fairbairn's death on February 19.
However, The Herald has discovered that, according to a little-known
chapter in Parliamentary Terms and Proceedings: ''there is no time limit
during which a constituency may be unrepresented''.
In addition, the motion to call the by-election deals with a matter of
parliamentary privilege so may be moved by any member of the House of
Commons.
Last night, Mr Martin Robb, chairman of Perth and Kinross Conservative
Association, said he was ''fascinated'' by the written procedure and had
no idea when the by-election would be held.
Mr John Godfrey, the Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate,
told The Herald he believed June 15 was the latest date for the
by-election but, like his chairman, had not been given a specific date.
Conservative Central Office refused to give an undertaking that the
by-election would be called before June 15.
Last night, the SNP said that if that deadline is passed, it would
consider forcing the Government's hand and issuing the writ itself.
Ms Roseanna Cunningham, the SNP's prospective parliamentary candidate
and favourite to take the seat from the Tories, said she was puzzled why
the Conservative Party was reluctant to name a date for the by-election.
''The political logic escapes us all and can only lead to the
conclusion that the Tories have absolutely no idea now what they are
doing at any level,'' she said.

Bonn, Friday
SEVERAL hundred people gathered at the remains of the Bergen-Belsen
Nazi concentration camp in northern Germany today to mark the 50th
anniversary of its liberation by the British at the end of the Second
World War.
About 300 participants brought together by churches and victims'
groups attended an ecumenical service, then walked along the ''Path of
Remembrance'' which inmates once took after getting off the transport
trains.
Throughout the day, in various parts of the memorial site near the
town of Celle, young people recited the names of all the known victims
of the camp.
In 1945, British cinema audiences wept as shocking pictures sent back
from Germany by the Allies closing on Hitler were screened on newsreels,
ensuring that ''Belsen'' became a byword for the Nazis' foulest deeds.
An estimated 35,000 people died at the camp, part of Hitler's ''final
solution'' to eradicate Europe's Jews. Many thousands more died from
disease and malnutrition after liberation on April 15, 1945.
The British Government had known for three years of the Nazis' policy
of exterminating Jews, but there had been reluctance to believe the
accounts of gas chambers and ovens.
Unlike the extermination camps in Germany and Poland where million of
Jews were put to death, the Nazis' weapon at Belsen was neglect.
When many German citizens living near the camp refused to believe it
existed, British soldiers herded large groups into cinemas to see proof
of the atrocities for themselves.
More than 10,000 unburied corpses were scattered across the camp when
the liberators arrived.
Richard Dimbleby, the first war correspondent to go inside the camp,
said it was ''the most horrible day of my life''. He described it as
''the world of the nightmare'' in its ''death and decay, corruption and
filth''.
Among the first soldiers to enter Belsen was British intelligence
officer Norman Turgel, who arrested ''the Beast of Belsen'', camp
commander Josef Kramer.
Kramer and other SS officers responsible for the atrocities went on
trial five months after the camp was liberated. They were hanged in
December 1945.
Turgel met his wife Gena, a prisoner, while searching for SS officers.
He said: ''Seeing these skeletons and trying to recognise whether they
were men, women, or children was shocking. After three days at Belsen I
could not get up in the morning. We were all paralysed with shock.''
Gena Turgel said such commemorations were important: ''Otherwise the
events will become consigned to the history books. Hopefully the young
people of today will never allow it to happen again.''
The only Briton known to have survived imprisonment at Belsen, the
late Jersey schoolmaster Harold Le Druillenac, recalled: ''When the
tanks passed through the camp, I was having my first meal for five days.
I was eating grass.''
Conditions were almost indescribable in the camp dominated by a giant
gallows and an open mass grave.
Piles of corpses lay inside and outside the huts. In some bunks,
bodies lay with the living. All the inmates suffered from emaciation and
disease.
Near the children's compound, and entirely visible, were stacks of
naked corpses. Weeping survivors told how some prisoners were reduced to
cutting chunks out of the bodies to eat.
Because this year's anniversary coincided with Easter and the start of
the Jewish Passover festival, the German Jewish community plans to
commemorate the anniversary of the liberation of concentration camps,
including Bergen-Belsen, on April 26-27.
German President Roman Herzog and the leader of Germany's Jewish
community, Ignatz Bubis, will address the main commemoration on April
27, the Jewish Day of the Holocaust.--Reuter/AP.

THE British Marbles Championships went ahead yesterday -- despite the
loss of the marbles.
A consignment of 300 tournament marbles went missing en route from the
Devon manufacturers to a village in West Sussex, where the annual
championships were being held.
However, organisers and players managed to scrape together enough old
marbles to play.
Tournament spokeswoman Julia McCarthy-Fox said: ''We managed to find
enough old marbles from people's homes and it was agreed that, since
everyone was playing with them, no-one would have a disadvantage.
''We even tried Maltesers at one point but it was a hot day and they
didn't last long.''
More than 100 players competed in the tournament at the Greyhound pub
at Tinsley Green, near Gatwick.
Reigning champions, the Black Dog Boozers, from nearby Crawley, were
defeated by the Barrel Scrapers from South Norwood, south London. The
individual winner was Paul Smith, from Charlwood, near Gatwick, and the
best woman player was Jeannette Le Bon, captain of the Barrel Scrapers.
Players had to knock 49 target marbles out of a 6ft sand-filled ring.
Ms McCarthy-Fox said the tournament marbles had been sent from the
makers by Parcelforce delivery on Monday.
A Parcelforce spokesman said: ''We are extremely sorry this particular
parcel seems to have gone astray.''
An inquiry was being mounted, he added.

Tokyo, Friday
JAPAN today mounted a huge crackdown on the doomsday cult linked to
nerve gas attacks after its leader warned that an even more terrible
disaster was about to strike Tokyo.
In Japan's largest peacetime security operation, about 100,000 police
officers -- more than one-third of the nation's force -- descended on
130 facilities owned by the cult and imposed heavy security checks
across the capital.
Police acted on the eve of what the leader of Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme
Truth Sect) prophesied would be a day of catastrophe for Tokyo -- more
devastating than the Kobe earthquake in January which killed some 5500
people.
Main commuter train stations bristled with police and widespread road
checks ground the capital's traffic to a halt.
In a sign of the nervousness gripping Tokyo, two big shopping centres
announced they would close tomorrow in response to the apocalyptic
prediction from Aum guru Shoko Asahara.
US military forces radio urged Americans in Japan to take care when
going out over the weekend.
Asahara forecast an event would take place on Saturday, possibly an
earthquake, ''that will make the Kobe earthquake seem as minor as a fly
landing on one's cheek''.
The sect claims that Asahara, who has also said the world will end in
1997, predicted the Kobe earthquake.
Asahara remained in hiding, too ill, his spokesman said, to appear in
public to answer charges against a cult subjected to almost daily police
raids after the March 20 sarin nerve gas attacks on the Tokyo subway
system.
A police spokesman said authorities were preparing an arrest warrant
for Asahara. He did not specify the charges.
Police said they had arrested 107 sect members since the subway attack
on charges including abduction, illegal confinement, and traffic
offences.
However they have not openly linked the group to the attack, which
killed 11 people and made more than 5000 ill. Aum has denied any link
with the attack.
Cult spokesman Fumihiro Joyu said Asahara's prophecy was based on his
astrology studies and that Aum posed no security threat.
''Please rest assured that Aum Shinri Kyo will not be taking any
action,'' Joyu said in a television interview.
Today's raid yielded more than 500 cardboard boxes of AUM documents
and small amounts of illegal chemicals, police said.
There were scuffles between Aum believers and riot police, who dragged
cult children kicking and screaming from their parents to be placed in
care.--Reuter.

Pressure is growing on the
Government to give nurses and health workers in Scotland the 3% pay
deal they are seeking.
Doctors in Edinburgh have passed a unanimous motion of support at the
annual meeting of Lothian division of the British Medical Association.
The group condemned the Government decision through a pay review body
to award health-care staff a 1% increase.
The statement also said: ''The Lothian division of the BMA calls on
all the NHS trusts in Lothian to award all these health service staff an
unconditional wage increase to bring the rise to 3% overall.''
Association honorary secretary, anaesthetist Dr Evan Lloyd, added:
''It is time the Government valued the services given by all those
employed in the health service.
''Nurses and health workers have been treated meanly in the current
pay round.''
0 The Glasgow division of the BMA is to meet on April 24.
Health-service unions have already lobbied the Scottish Office and
held rallies across Scotland in protest at the 1% offer, warning of
possible strike action if an acceptable deal was not reached.
Last night, Mr Jim Devine, senior regional officer of the public
sector union Unison said he appreciated the remarks of Lothian division
of the BMA.
He said:''Our claim is for the retention of pay bargaining, 3% across
the board, fully-funded, with no strings attached.''
While none of the hospital trusts has yet reached agreement, the union
is consulting its branches on possible further action.
Mr Devine added that while no agreement had been made at national
level, it was significant that no enabling circular had been forwarded
to the trusts by the Scottish Home and Health Department.
This, he said, was a matter of concern for the union.

<TEXT>
Bonn, Friday
BRITISH, Dutch, Polish, and French people gathered in the sleepy east
German town of Colditz to mark the liberation 50 years ago on Sunday of
the legendary prisoner-of-war jail in a 16th-century castle.
However none of the surviving prisoners will be able to attend the
commemorations.
''You have to remember there are not many of us left, and people are
old and not necessarily in the best of health,'' said retired Major Hugh
Bruce, chairman of the Colditz veterans' association.
''Only about 20 of us have ever been back,'' he added.
The communist authorities in former East Germany played down Colditz
and other wartime events that portrayed Western countries in a positive
light.
Today, however, the town is now keen to change all that. ''This is a
date for us and we should mark it, not with a big celebration but with
dignity,'' said Mayor Manfred Heinz.
The untiring ingenuity of Colditz's prisoners in trying to escape from
their German captors has given rise to films, dozens of books, a board
game, and a television series.
The inmates -- British, French, Dutch, Poles, Czechs, Australians,
Canadians, and Serbs -- were mostly officers who had already attempted
to escape from other camps.
The Germans hoped to swop them for their own officers and therefore
generally treated them humanely.
Bruce said prisoners were mostly treated in line with the Geneva
Convention and there was no resentment. ''Colditz was not a brutal
place,'' he said.
Indeed, when Colditz was liberated, the prisoners had already taken
control of the castle under a gentlemen's agreement with their captors.
Colditz's museum testifies to the prisoners' skills in making
convincing German uniforms, false documents, skeleton keys, and other
equipment for escape bids. Out of at least 300 attempts, 31 managed to
escape.--Reuter.

OSCAR-WINNING American actor and singer Burl Ives, whose gentle voice
helped popularise folk music, died of cancer at his home yesterday.
Ives, 85, whose bear-like frame, bearded face, and smooth sound were
familiar to millions around the world, had been in declining health
since August, when he underwent back surgery and doctors discovered
cancer of the mouth, said Marjorie Schicktanz Ashley, his agent for more
than 20 years.
He fell into a coma on Wednesday and died later at home in Anacortes,
Washington. His wife Dorothy and her three adult children were with him,
she said.
He was best known for his renditions of American folk tunes like The
Blue Tail Fly and children's songs such as Holly Jolly Christmas and
Down in the Valley and for powerful dramatic roles in films including
The Big Country, for which he won an Acadamy Award for best supporting
actor, and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.
He was also well known to millions from years of work on television as
the singer-narrator of the 1962 television special Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer, still an annual staple of the Christmas season.
''He just had a voice that people loved,'' Ashley said.
Born Burle Ivanhoe in Hunt, Illinois, Ives took to the road with his
guitar in his youth and travelled widely, learning folk songs from
hoboes and workers.
Along with his contemporaries Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Josh
White, he helped to popularise American folk music.
In 1930, he dropped out of Eastern Illinois State Teacher's College
and began a trek that took him to 46 states, Canada, and Mexico,
collecting folk songs from the miners, cowboys, and fishermen he met.
''My feet were itching,'' he wrote in his 1948 autobiography, The
Wayfaring Stranger. ''I did all right in the beginning of college but
finally I was bored as hell. I grabbed my guitar and hit the road.
''Since I was a child, I knew I was going to be a performer,'' he said
in a February 1993 interview. ''It was something I knew in my heart of
hearts that I would always do.''
He made his Broadway debut in 1938 but was most famous for originating
the role of Big Daddy in the Tennessee Williams' play Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof in the 1950s.
At the end of the Depression, he was in New York City, trying to crack
the big time with home-grown favourites like Goober Peas and My Gal Sal.
He continued singing and acting well into his seventies and gave a
solo performance in 1993 to benefit a community foundation near his
adopted home of Anacortes, halfway between Seattle and Vancouver,
British Columbia. He moved there in 1990 from Montecito, California.
Poet Carl Sandburg called him ''the mightiest ballad singer of this or
any other century,'' but in the early days Ives took some ribbing about
''the songs of the people'' that he loved.
One night, he broke off from a tender ballad, I Gave My Love a Cherry,
to mix it up with a member of a New York audience who jeered at the
''sissy song''.
Ives decked him and ''wound up with a couple of black eyes'', he
recalled. The day after the fracas, he ran into Elia Kazan, who was
casting for Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, who was
impressed.
''He said he knew then I was an aggressive male,'' Ives said. ''It's
one of the reasons I got 'Cat'.''
He made the role his own, getting Kazan and Williams to go along with
his suggestion that the Southern patriarch be played like an old-time
preacher.
The part as written was ''dull as hell'', he grumbled.
Ives played Big Daddy on Broadway in 1955 and in the 1958 film. He
also appeared in East of Eden, Desire Under the Elms, and The Big
Country, for which he won the 1958 Oscar for best supporting actor.
His music topped country-western and children's music charts during
the 1940s and 1950s and established traditions for later generations
with Frosty, Little White Duck, I Know an Old Lady (Who Swallowed a
Fly), and A Little Bitty Tear.
He was one of six children in a farming family. He said his clay
pipe-smoking grandmother taught him many of the songs he sang all his
life. He made his first public appearance at a soldiers' reunion, when
he was four.
For a time, he appeared with the folk group the Weavers. He began
broadcasting on CBS radio in the 1940s and appeared on television from
the 1950s on.
In a 1987 interview, Ives said he had no thought of retiring.
''I never want to know what that word means. Does the sun retire? I'm
still learning, growing, and changing,'' he said.
''When you've got goals and dreams, you don't feel old.''

Washington, Friday,
IRAN has been delivering large quantities of arms to the Bosnian
Government for the past year, according to the Washington Post.
There have been persistent rumours of such deliveries in the past, but
today the Post asserts that senior American officials have confirmed
them.
The paper says that the United States has turned a blind eye to the
violation of the UN embargo on arms supplies to states in the former
Yugoslavia. President Clinton has often deplored the embargo on arms
sales to Bosnia, arguing that it is the victim of Serb aggression and
should be allowed to defend itself.
The British Government has taken the lead in opposing a lifting of the
embargo, on the grounds that to do so would endanger UN peacekeeping
forces in Bosnia and Croatia and would lead to an escalation of the
fighting. The Clinton administration now accepts the argument.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate and leading
candidate for the Republican presidential nomination next year, has
introduced a resolution into the Senate that would instruct the
president to lift the embargo unilaterally. The resolution has been
vigorously opposed by the president and by every British Minister
visiting Washington in the past two years.
If, however, the Bosnians are obtaining all the arms they need
clandestinely, the political argument here loses much of its force.
Congress passed a Bill last year, and President Clinton signed it,
ordering the US to stop enforcing the embargo. Since then, US
intelligence has stopped informing the UN and Nato of any arms movements
into Yugoslavia it has detected.
The Bosnian army has done much better against the Serbs in the past
six months than before, and has evidently received small arms,
ammunition, mortars, and anti-tank weapons in large quantities. It
launched an offensive last month that made some progress, and observers
expect the war to resume full-force when spring has finally arrived in
the Balkans. The current ceasefire expires on May 1.
Iran is assumed to be supporting the Bosnians out of Muslim
solidarity. The Americans' acquiescence in this operation runs counter
to its general policy of opposing Iran's meddling in foreign disputes:
it opposes Iran sending arms to Algerian rebels through Sudan, for
instance.
It is also possible that allowing Iran to arm and train Muslim armies
in Europe may lead to the rise of Muslim fundamentalism there. That is
what happened in Afghanistan when the United States armed first the
fundamentalist fedayeen against the Russians and then the Communist
regime there. Some warriors trained there are now on trial in New York
for planning terrorist acts in the city.
The Post report says that the arms are shipped to Bosnia through
Croatia, which extracts part of the shipments for its own use. The paper
says that several hundred million dollars' worth of arms have been sent,
including shipments of Uzi machine guns acquired by the Shah from Israel
in the 1970s.
The White House issued a statement today saying that the United States
supports the UN embargo.

SCOTLAND'S 45 tenant farmers on British Coal land, who are angry at
being invited to buy their property at what they describe as ''grossly
inflated'' prices, have been advised to submit counter offers.
It follows a meeting between the National Farmers' Union and British
Coal's property division -- and a second letter sent this week from
union president John Ross to Michael Heseltine at the Department of
Trade and Industry, insisting that the farmers be treated fairly.
Farmers throughout Scotland have argued that valuations of their
properties have been fixed at amounts 25 to 35 times their annual rent,
making it impossible for them to bid successfully.
They also fear that the situation could see asset stripping, with
investors outbidding the tenant farmers who want to buy, despite the
fact they had invested heavily in their own operations and, in many
cases, farming the land formerly owned by the National Coal Board for
generations.
The farms are broadly spread across central Scotland. One farmer, Mr
Robert Nelson, who farms Blairmains near Culross in West Fife,
complained that, in the past, farm properties had been sold to sitting
tenants in the region of 50% of open-market value but could be sold to
buying groups at only 30% to 40% of market value.
Last night Mr Nelson added: ''Over the last few years we have seen the
Government moves to allow council house tenants to buy their properties.
Why are we not being given the same degree of fairness?''
The DTI has said it wants to see the agricultural estates disposed of
by the end of the year.
Mr Ian Melrose, legal adviser to the NFU, admitted that the union was
keeping a close watch in the run-up to any proposed sales. He agreed
that valuation prices were grossly inflated, adding: ''For that reason,
we have advised those who have had offers to submit counter offers.
''The reason for that is that tenants have made many improvements to
their properties, and there is also the question of lengthy family
involvement.
''Our tenants are now being invited to tender under conditions of some
duress.''
British Coal, he said, was obliged under the Industry Act of 1994 to
achieve the best possible prices for taxpayers' benefit in the sell-off
but he pointed out: ''Under the security of tenure situation in
Scotland, there should be better offers.''
Mr Melrose added: ''I can confirm that following a meeting with
British Coal property division, union president Mr John Ross has written
once more to Michael Heseltine, asking his department to deal with
tenants in a fair way.''

IT IS only in the last six months of a varied 50-year political career
that Francois Mitterrand, President of France until May 7, has chosen to
reveal some uncomfortable truths about his past.
It seems a desperate effort to shape the image he hopes to leave to
posterity: last autumn he admitted his career in the wartime Vichy
government and did nothing to hinder publication of photographs of his
illegitimate 21-year-old daughter, Mazarine.
Cancer, for which the President has been undergoing gruelling
chemotherapy, has added urgency to the task. His latest, doubtless last
effort is a book of interviews with an old friend, the Nobel
prize-winning writer, Elie Wiesel. Newly published in France, it is
already being criticised for skirting around essential historical
issues: but it is all we can now expect from a man who says life will
probably be too fleeting, when he steps down next month, to let him
write his memoirs.
Based on talks with Mr Wiesel since 1987 and inspired by a suggestion
of Socialist Culture Minister Jack Lang, Memoire a deux voix (Memoirs in
Two Voices) was conceived as an exercise in philosophical badinage about
literature and religion. Yet Mr Wiesel, a survivor of Auschwitz and
Buchenwald concentration camps, was so upset last autumn when the
president revealed his Vichy career and his acquaintance with the
regime's police chief Rene Bousquet, an ardent collaborator and
persecutor of Jews, that extra interviews were added.
They are not satisfactory. Mr Wiesel allows the president to elude
almost all mention of Vichy and twist and turn about Bousquet.
No, the president was not aware that Vichy had introduced anti-Semitic
legislation. No, he had only known Bousquet after the war, and had never
been aware of what he did during it. In short, the book sheds no more
light on the president's past than the television interview last autumn
which finally readjusted the old official line that his war had been one
of resistance.
Mr Mitterrand's memories of the early stages of the war, meanwhile,
give a vivid picture of a country falling apart as it rumbled towards
defeat. In Lorraine, Mr Mitterrand, who was posted on the German side of
the French Maginot Line, visited abandoned French homes which had been
pillaged and wilfully destroyed by French troops.
He saw comrades blown to pieces in German artillery attacks and,
injured and evacuated on a stretcher, was abandoned on an open road by
his carriers who plunged for cover when Nazi fighters dived to strafe
them.
''Nothing held. A certain number of collective moral values had
disappeared. The defeat of France in 1940 was the result of a spiritual
disintegration.
''It was not an accident. France had strength, means, riches. If the
country had not managed to assemble those means, it was because her very
spirit had been affected,'' he writes.
It was, however, on the crucial issue of Vichy that his critics were
awaiting an explanation. Lawyer and Nazi-hunter Serge Klarsfeld, who
brought SS captain Klaus Barbie to trial in Lyon in 1986, reacted
angrily yesterday to the president's remarks about Bousquet and his
allegation that he, Klarsfeld, had waited as long as 1989 before
pressing charges.
''I first campaigned against Bousquet in 1978 and organised
demonstrations in Paris in front of the Indo-Suez bank of which he was a
director,'' Mr Klarsfeld told Le Monde.
The writer Bernard-Henri Levy was also bitter, especially about
passages in which President Mitterrand says that his main concern in the
aftermath of the war had always been to preserve national unity.
''What shocks me is the way in which the president continues to regard
our French form of fascism,'' Mr Levy wrote yesterday in the magazine Le
Point. He accused the President of banalising Vichy and ''reducing its
infamy'' to merely a sort of disagreement between French people.
''Mitterrand was a Petainist, not just through opportunity, but by
conviction. And deep down inside, he remains one,'' Mr Levy wrote.
''Any regrets or remorse?'' Mr Wiesel asks the president about the war
in their book.
''Neither one nor the other. The trial to which I am being subjected
is shameful. I am at peace with myself,'' he replies.

SURGEONS at the private Health Care International medical complex in
Clydebank have successfully carried out an innovative cardio-vascular
operation for the first time in Scotland.
Less than 24 hours after 60-year-old Mr Charles Bell, a National
Health Service patient, from Easthouses, Midlothian, received treatment
for an abdominal aortic aneurysm -- a serious medical condition
affecting the flow of blood -- he had recovered sufficiently to get up
and walk around his room in the #180m private hospital.
The operation, carried out on Thursday afternoon by the director of
clinical affairs, Dr Larry Hollier, involved making a two-inch incision
in Mr Bell's groin and inserting a catheter through which an artificial
graft, repairing the damaged aorta, was put into position. The graft,
made of an expanding metal, was custom-made for Mr Bell.
Dr Hollier said the use of grafts was a well-known technique but this
particular type of repair had not been carried out in Scotland and only
rarely in the United States.
He said: ''Using minimally invasive techniques such as stents or
grafts are not in themselves uncommon. Until recently, however, they
were not used on aortic aneurysms because the risks were considered too
great for such an important and delicate vessel.
''It is a procedure which is far quicker and cheaper. Its main benefit
is the minimum of risk to the patient and the reduction of trauma.''
He added that Mr Bell had responded well to the treatment and should
not need follow-up surgery. He also offered to demonstrate the technique
to consultants working in the public sector.
The hospital's business development manager, Mr Rick Taylor, said Mr
Bell had first come to the HCI hospital for a coronary artery bypass
graft after being referred by Lothian Health Board in a move to cut
waiting lists at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh. During that
operation, the abdominal aortic aneurysm was discovered.
The centre agreed to take NHS patients like Mr Bell in a bid to fill
beds. However, Mr Taylor said there was now an 85% occupancy rate, with
the majority of patients from the Middle East.
He was unable to put a figure on the cost of the operation but a
spokesman for Lothian Health Board said Mr Bell was one of a group of
around 14 patients whose operations had been contracted out to HCI and
there had been no additional cost to the board.
As he chatted with Dr Hollier and enjoyed a cup of tea, Mr Bell said
he felt considerably better than he had after his bypass operation in
January. On that occasion, he had spent a week in hospital but he is
expected to leave HCI today.

Vatican City, Friday,
THE Pope, weakened by recent illness, for the first time asked others
to help carry the Cross through this year's Good Friday procession.
Another innovation was that three of the six people assigned to bear
the Cross around the Colosseum were women: a Swiss Protestant nun, a
teenager from Rome, and an Italian mother of three daughters.
Women have never before taken a direct role in the procession.
The Pope has walked with a limp and relied on a cane since hip
replacement surgery after breaking his leg last year.
In Jerusalem, one of the largest crowds of pilgrims in years retraced
Christ's steps towards crucifixion along the Via Dolorosa, the
PLO-Israeli peace accord having brought a tourism boom.
However Israel, shielding revellers of the Jewish Passover from the
spectre of Islamic suicide bombings, has sealed off its borders to all
Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank. Troops and police are on high
alert.
In the Philippines, dozens of penitents beat themselves with bamboo
whips or were nailed to wooden crosses in an annual Good Friday
ritual.--Reuter/AP.

<HEADLINE>Millionaire Dunnet is bidder for Clyde shipyard Millionaire bids for shipyard</HEADLINE>

MILLIONAIRE Scots businessman Mr Frank Dunnet has been revealed as the
bidder for Ferguson Shipbuilders.
Mr Dunnet owns electrical wholesalers Holland House Electrical, based
in Scotland Street in Glasgow.
His offer to buy Ferguson in Port Glasgow, the last shipyard on the
Lower Clyde, prompted the company's management buy-out team to withdraw
its takeover plans last week.
The Dunnet bid and one made earlier by industrialist Sir Ross Belch,
chairman of the shipyard's holding company Ferguson Marine, are being
considered by the board of directors and a decision on a possible
recommendation to Ferguson's 300 shareholders is expected soon.
Sir Ross, who led the successful revival of Ferguson along with its
chief executive Mr Bill Scott, has proposed that the company be taken
over by Altnacraig Shipping, a firm of which he is also chairman.
Altnacraig's offer is believed to be about #3.5m or more. It is not
known if the bid by Mr Dunnet is higher than this.
Mr Dunnet, who lives in the Wemyss Bay area and is believed to have
other business interests including farming, was not available for
comment yesterday on what plans he has for the company if his bid
succeeds.
He is understood not to have any existing connection with the
shipbuilding industry.
Ferguson's workforce of 320, who have been speculating about their
potential new management for several weeks, were unaware of the new
bidder's identity yesterday.
When told by The Herald last night, union convener Mr Ian Colville
said he believed many workers would support Mr Dunnet's offer, partly
because it would secure ownership and continuance of the company based
in the West of Scotland.
Altnacraig would not do this because it is based in London and its
largest single shareholder is the Norwegian shipping company, Jebsens.
The only other merchant shipyard in Scotland, Kvaerner Govan, is also
owned by a Norwegian firm.
Mr Colville said: ''It is difficult to comment without knowing what Mr
Dunnet's plans would be but I think the workers will be quite relieved
to learn that he is a Scottish businessmen who probably knows the
company very well.
''But we will be happy with whoever owns Ferguson's, as long as they
continue in the mould of the present management. This is not an ailing
yard.
The Ferguson directors considering the bids after taking financial
advice are Mr Scott, Sir Ian Denholm, Mr Gordon Parham, Mr Richard
Parkinson, and Mr Richard Dean.
It is also possible that they would recommend that neither bid be
accepted.
The biggest single shareholder in Ferguson is Norwegian ship owner Mr
Per Greig but no one person or company owns the majority of the shares.
About 200 of the Ferguson workers have about 5% of the shares held in
trust by the management.
However, Sir Ross's move may benefit from the fact that a large number
of shareholders in Altnacraig also own shares in Ferguson.
The contest for control of Ferguson has emerged during the most
successful period in the yard's modern history.
Earlier this year, it announced a #12.5m contract for a sophisticated
North Sea platform supply vessel and this took its orders to more than
#100m since it was privatised in 1989.
It has almost #50m of orders in hand and made profits of #1.5m last
year on a turnover of just less than #20m.
HRH Princess Alexandra will launch the new #16m ferry, Isle of Lewis,
at the yard on Tuesday.
The contract for the vessel, the largest to sail to the islands and
the biggest built by Ferguson, was awarded to the company by Caledonian
MacBrayne for their Ullapool-Stornoway service.

Pretoria, Friday,
SOUTH African President Nelson Mandela today sacked his estranged wife
Winnie for the second time, saying it was necessary for good government.
Mandela said that he had reconsidered her appointment as a deputy
Minister of Arts, Culture, Science, and technology in light of her legal
challenge to her dismissal. The answer he came up with was the same: she
must go.
Mandela's move came two days after Mrs Mandela, 60, was reinstated
after she launched a court action over her March 27 dismissal.
''After due reflection I have decided in accordance with the powers
vested in me by the constitution to terminate Mrs Winnie Mandela's
appointment and to appoint Mrs Brigitte Mabandla to the post,'' Mandela
said in a statement.
''The overriding consideration, as in this instance, is what the
president believes is necessary in pursuit of good government and the
interests of the country as a whole.''
The dismissal would take effect from April 18 when Mabandla, an
African National Congress MP and veteran human rights lawyer, would take
up her post.
Mrs Mandela, separated from her husband since 1992, launched a Supreme
Court action last Monday to have her earlier dismissal from the
government declared unlawful and unconstitutional.
The president's main black political opponent, Inkatha Freedom Party
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is a junior partner in the national
unity government, had supported Mrs Mandela's action, saying in terms of
the constitution he should have been consulted on the sacking.
The president, at the time on a tour of the Gulf, then reinstated Mrs
Mandela as deputy Arts Minister, saying her dismissal nearly three weeks
ago should be considered invalid.
However, on his return last night, Mandela consulted Buthelezi and
deputy presidents Thabo Mbeki and F W de Klerk over Mrs Mandela's
position.
He then announced her dismissal and again refused to give reasons.
''There is no requirement for reasons behind such decisions to be made
public. Such a precedent would impact negatively on the ability of the
executive to govern well and wisely,'' his statement said.
Mrs Mandela has been a vociferous critic of Mandela's unity government
but sources in his ruling ANC said the main reason for her original
sacking was her defiance of presidential orders to cancel a trip to West
Africa.
The ANC said today that it gave its unequivocal support for the
president's decision to sack Mrs Mandela.
The South African president said he wished to thank his wife for her
service to the government.--Reuter.

THE Rangers financial juggernaut found a new gear yesterday as it
moved into the outside lane to try to raise #10m to bring more top-class
players to Ibrox.
The new recruits will play in a ''blue heaven'' -- which was revealed
at a secular news conference as a 51,000 capacity all-blue seated
stadium with giant video screens where the only concession to the colour
green will be the grass.
Announcing the initiative, ''Ready for the Future'', Rangers chairman
David Murray said the club was at a major crossroads.
''I, like many supporters, have greater ambitions. Although we are
satisfied with what we have done, we need to go out and play in the
Champions' League on a regular basis. So this initiative is an ideal
opportunity for supporters to get behind us if they can,'' he said.
The initiative will invite Rangers season ticket holders to part with
#399, which will guarantee them the right to buy the season ticket for
their seat at Ibrox for the next 25 years. According to the club, this
means that supporters will be paying out less than #1 a game for their
guarantee over aquarter of a century. All the money raised will go to
buy players.
Mr Murray said: ''We are competing in a market in which transfer fees
of around #4m and #5m are almost commonplace.
''On the domestic front, commercial opportunities available to
Scottish clubs are limited while the financial demands on the day-to-day
running of the club are always increasing.
''As a result, we require a player transfer reserve to provide the
club with maximum flexibility to participate in the player transfer
market. That is why I need the help of Rangers supporters.''
Mr Murray said that, in return, the club was offering supporters a
wide range of benefits and his personal guarantee that all the monies
raised would go towards buying players.
He added: ''We are creating a 'blue heaven' for our supporters at
Ibrox. Early in the new season, we will have a 51,000 capacity all-blue
seated stadium, and we will become the first club in Scotland to
introduce giant video screens. This additional capacity has enabled us
to offer several thousand more supporters on our waiting list the
opportunity to buy season tickets.''
At present, the club has 35,000 season ticket holders, with 10,000 on
the waiting list.
Mr Murray continued: ''Ready for the Future will ensure that players
of the calibre of Brian Laudrup and Mark Hateley are brought to Ibrox.
Our fans demand this quality. They now have the opportunity to help us
to maintain the highest standards.''
Mr Murray said that, over the past seven years of his stewardship,
they had spent #33m on the stadium and #14m on players. Bringing the
capacity up to 51,000 and installing the video screens would cost an
extra #4m.
He said: ''When we consider that season ticket money has only brought
us in #27m, you can see there is a need to look at alternative methods.
''We are not playing on a level playing field in Scotland. It is the
same price to watch Rangers as it is Grimsby Town. So we have to go to
our supporters to seek additional funds. Not everyone can afford that.
We accept that. But for those that are able to help the club, we look
for their backing to build up the player transfer reserve that will
enable the manager to spend between #7m and #10m this summer.
''Rangers ambitions are endless. So are mine. I want to take the club
to a different level both on and off the park.''
In return for contributions of #399 (#199 for juveniles and #279 for
senior citizens) supporters will get:
* the right to buy the season ticket for their seat at Ibrox for the
next 25 years
* their name on the seat:
* a certificate recognising their contribution:
* the right to transfer their seat within their immediate family:
* 10% discount at Rangers shops and Argyle House restaurant:
* a free weekend ticket worth up to #40 for Rangers' pre-season
tournament when Tottenham, Steaua Bucharest, and Sampdoria visit Ibrox
on July 29/30.
To help supporters, the club has set up an information line -- 0141
427 8998.

MR TONY BLAIR was in a ''no compromise'' mood yesterday after the
decision by a second big union, Unison, to oppose his bid to scrap
Clause 4 of the Labour constitution.
Sources close to him denounced leaders of the Transport and General
Workers' and Unison as ''old fashioned'' and ''out of touch with the
grass roots''.
The two unions, which have refused to hold a ballot of their members
on the issue, were also described as ''activist dominated''.
Together with some other unions who want Clause 4 to stay, they
command about 30% of the votes at the special Labour conference which is
to decide the future of the clause on April 29.
Mr Blair still believes he can win and is heartened by the
unexpectedly large amount of support from constituency parties who, it
was thought at one time, would provide most of the opposition to change.
He has ruled out the idea of softening some of his new Labour policy
lines involving more support for the free market and education changes,
which have annoyed some left-wing activists.
Three members of the Shadow Cabinet came out fighting yesterday,
effectively accusing the dissident unions of failing to consult members
properly.
Mr Donald Dewar, Shadow Social Security Secretary, who is close to Mr
Blair, said: ''There is no place for secret deals in smoke-filled rooms
or concessions or retreats.''
He cited the decisions taken by the party's Scottish, Women's, and
Youth conferences and where constituency parties and trade unions had
balloted their members to show there was ''a very, very substantial
movement in the party in favour of change''.
The Shadow Chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, said there would be ''no
trade-offs''. He added: ''Where ballots or polls have taken place, they
show strong support for change.''
The Shadow Employment Secretary, Ms Harriet Harman, argued that early
returns from the constituencies showed that individual members, given
the chance to vote, had been voting eight-to-one in favour of the new
Clause 4.
Ms Harman denied any suggestion of ''riding roughshod'' over union
leadership and appealing directly to the membership.
''It is a question of allowing the members to express their views . .
. like for example the AEU balloted their members and 90% were in
support of the new clause,'' she said.
The Transport Workers position was determined by its national
executive's vote; Unison's by a 55-47 vote at a meeting of its political
committee.
Even with constituency support looking overwhelmingly in his favour,
Mr Blair will need to persuade some of the unions still to reach
decisions. The unions have a total of 70% of the votes at the
conference, local parties only 30%.
His speech to the USDAW conference six days before the special
conference could swing their votes -- 5% of the total -- his way.
There were suggestions by some Unison delegates that their political
committee vote had gone against the leadership as much because of unease
at Mr Blair's attempts to woo middle- class voters as over the content
of Clause 4 itself.
One delegate who voted for no change, Mr Mike Folyard (Central
Manchester) said he was concerned about Mr Blair's stress on free
markets. ''We have many members who have been victims and have suffered
from things like compulsory tendering,'' he said.
He added that he thought very few people could not live with Mr
Blair's new draft of Clause 4, which rejects the present one's
commitment to sweeping nationalisation. ''But we feel very strongly
about public services being preserved in public ownership,'' he added.
There is now some dispute about whether the vote of Unison's political
committee need bind all its special conference delegates to vote one
way, or whether they could split to reflect the balance of opinion shown
in the committee vote.
One delegate, Mr Geoff Martin, a member of the Defend Clause 4
Committee, said the union had always stood for collective responsibility
with everyone accepting the result of a vote. He added: ''I will fight
tooth and nail to maintain this.''
Mr Alan Johnston, the communication workers' leader, echoed Mr Dewar's
claim that where there had been a genuine rank and file debate the cause
of reform had usually triumphed. All of his members had been sent copies
of Clause 4 and its proposed replacement and he said he would be very
surprised if the ballot result to be announced next Friday did not show
overwhelming support for Mr Blair.

A GROUP of rank and file Scottish Conservatives have called for a
private conference with Mr Major to discuss the disastrous local
election results and a way forward for the ailing party.
Grassroots Tories have rubbished the official party line that disunity
was to blame for the electoral defeat.
They have pointed to the constitutional issue as a key factor.
The move comes as news leaked of a confidential Cabinet paper which
completely rules out devolution for Scotland, despite the recent
humiliation of the Tories at the polls and their being braced to defend
the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn's Perth seat.
The document, prepared by new Downing Street policy chief Norman
Blackwell, stresses that the Tory drive to win the next General Election
should concentrate on economic and family security. It is understood
copies were issued to Ministers at a Cabinet meeting last week.
The document will be a blow to Tory supporters of the need for a
change of heart on devolution.
Bailie John Young, one of Scotland's leading Tory councillors, said he
had heard of the Cabinet blueprint, which dismisses devolution out of
hand.
The document is also believed to oppose regional assemblies, take a
''tough line'' on Brussels, rule out a written constitution and bill of
rights, and demand no change to the House of Lords.
But Mr Young said: ''That is not exactly going to set the heather on
fire. If that is the basis of a manifesto I don't think it's going to
work.''
Mr Young said he would support the principle of devolution if it was
what the people wanted and had been properly worked out.
He said: ''If it appeared to give a better service to the people, the
short answer is yes I would support it but if it did not give that then
the answer would be no I would not.''
Bailie Young, councillor for Glasgow Newlands, who will head the
Conservatives on Glasgow new shadow local authority, said: ''We have
asked for a special conference where around 1000 party members could put
forward their feelings and proposals behind closed doors, possibly to
the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State, and others.
''It would be a short cut to hear a cross-section of views within the
party. We are in a very serious situation and the fact is we cannot
shrug that off.''
He dismissed the official excuse for the election defeat -- disunity
within the party -- and said policies were to blame.
VAT increases, huge boardroom pay rises, lack of job security and law
and order were among the real issues among the Scottish electorate.
A Scottish Conservative Party spokesman said last night he would not
be surprised if grass-roots Tories had demanded a meeting with John
Major.
The spokesman, who insisted that the party's policy on devolution
remained rock solid against any form of dilution of the Union, however
admitted there was considerable swathes of nominally Conservative
opinion in Scotland which had distanced itself from official party
policy in view of the hostility expressed at Tory ideas seen to be
coming from a London, metropolitan angle.
One of these dissenting voices, Mr Arthur Bell, chairman of the
radical Tory Reform Group, said: ''Ian Lang is making a serious mistake
in closing the door to devolution. That door should be kept wide open.''
Mr Bell added: ''There is much room for improvement both in our
constitution and in our society and anyone that thinks that the
electorate will be won over by negativism is wrong.''
The Scottish National Party, meanwhile, is prepared to break with
tradition and move a writ to call the Perth and Kinross by-election if
the Conservatives fail to face the electorate by Thursday, June 15.
Although convention states that the Government has until that date to
hold the election, it is not bound by any statutory requirement and
could leave the seat unrepresented indefinitely.
If it fails to serve the writ within the next four weeks, it could
face an unprecedented attempt by the SNP to force its hand.
With the Easter parliamentary recess delaying the announcement of the
by-election date still further, the opposition parties have accused the
Government of ''running scared''.
Under normal circumstances, the date of a by-election is set by the
party whose member formerly held the seat; it is usually held within
three to four months following that member's death or resignation. In
the case of Perth and Kinross, June 15 is the final Thursday in the
four-month span from Sir Nicholas's death on February 19.
However, The Herald has discovered that, according to a little-known
chapter in Parliamentary Terms and Proceedings: ''there is no time limit
during which a constituency may be unrepresented''.
In addition, the motion to call the by-election deals with a matter of
parliamentary privilege so may be moved by any member of the House of
Commons.

SCOTTISH international footballer Gerry Creaney was detained in
hospital yesterday after an attack outside a nightclub during a birthday
celebration.
Portsmouth striker Creaney, 25 on Thursday, and former England
international Mark Chamberlain, were taken to hospital following the
attack at the Pyramids club in Southsea, Hampshire.
A spokesman for Portsmouth Football Club said Creaney and Chamberlain
were set upon as they waited for a taxi outside the club early
yesterday.
He added: ''Gerry is in such a bad way everyone is really shocked. He
has been seen by a specialist and has been told he may have a fractured
cheekbone.
''The specialist has told him he will not play football again this
season and he may well need several operations to repair the damage.''
Chamberlain was not as seriously injured. He was released from
hospital after treatment.
Earlier in the day, Creaney had been put on standby for the Scottish
squad for their game against San Marino on April 26 in the European
Championship qualifying stages.
Creaney, who has scored 22 goals for Portsmouth this season, is rated
as a #1.5m player.
Chamberlain, 32, tried to break up a fight which started early
yesterday. His wife Wendy said: ''Apparently, they were set upon by a
gang of lads who were trying to get Gerry.
''They started to attack him, and Mark tried to get in and stop them.
He was hurt as well and he couldn't stop them laying into Gerry, so he
went for help.
''Both of the lads are in quite a bad way and they have said Gerry
might need an operation. He was in such a state this morning he couldn't
even speak.''
Police confirmed that they had spoken to Creaney and Chamberlain about
the incident -- but the two footballers declined to press charges.
''We have made inquiries and we have been unable to establish the
identity of the attackers. We have been told that the two victims don't
want the matter taken any further at this stage, so there is nothing
more we can do,'' he said.
Portsmouth's manager Terry Fenwick learned of Creaney's fate as he
prepared to take his side to Yorkshire for the First Division match with
Barnsley at Oakwell.
Fenwick said: ''It's bad news but Gerry probably wouldn't have played
anyway. He's got a bit of a hamstring injury.''
Creaney is Portsmouth's record signing and joined the Fratton Park
club for #650,000 from Celtic last season.
He has been included in two Scotland international squads this season
and scored six goals in 11 matches for the Scottish under-21s.
Chamberlain, who played eight times for England, was released by
Portsmouth at the start of this season and has been playing in the
second division for Brighton.

MORE than 3000 people have so far responded to the call for help from
campaigners fighting to win back Edinburgh's Powderhall Stadium for
greyhound racing.
Hope -- Hands Off Powderhall Evermore -- is confident of exceeding its
initial 10,000 target.
Earlier this week, former sprinter Bert Logan, a bookmaker who
specialises in greyhound racing and who ran Powderhall during its glory
days, chaired a campaign press conference to launch the petition.
Pledges of support have come from councillors as well as figures from
the business and sporting worlds.
The campaign was mounted amid fears that the new ownership of
Powderhall, which Hope has traced through a chain of companies to
Buckinghamshire businessman Derek Hankinson, intends to redevelop the
ground as an office and shops complex and, perhaps, a cinema multiplex.
The venue was sold after the Bank of Scotland called in receivers.
Campaigners are considering some form of sanctions against the bank
which they feel is not answering their questions satisfactorily.
They are also considering targeting Glasgow-based solicitor Mrs
Annette Pairman, of W and J Burness, who is said to speak for the
stadium's owners.
Hope was formed initially by greyhound owners and their trainers who
have been told their dogs will never run at Powderhall again.
They were joined by speedway fans who suspected the Edinburgh Monarchs
would be given the same treatment at the end of the current season.
Hibs captain Gordon Hunter was the first to sign Hope's petition, to
be circulated throughout the east of Scotland.

REMEMBER the golly on the jar? One of them escaped from a
politically-correct jam yesterday.
The ''showpiece'' golliwog was removed from an auctioneer's display
window after a woman complained about it being offensive. However, it
found a new home at a Borders museum, where it is set to go on show with
lots of teddy bear friends in a few days.
Museum owner Felix Sear, who paid #88 when it went under the hammer at
Phillips salerooms in Edinburgh, said he was sad about the incident,
adding that he would be delighted to talk to the woman and discuss the
golliwog and its history.
''I hope whoever it was might be thinking of this soft toy in a
different light.
''It is a very nice companion and I think it will have given and will
continue to give children, who we find are besotted with them, a lot of
happiness. These toys are fun items and should not be seen as taboo.
''I find it curious to take it to that extreme,'' said Mr Sear, the
founder of Scotland's Teddy Bear Museum in Melrose.
He named his latest acquisition on the spot calling it Phillip Golly.
The toy, more than 60 years old, will join the museum's other original
and virtually identical golliwog called Good Golly.
Recently, an unidentified woman went into the salerooms and told the
receptionist the golliwog in their George Street window was offensive.
A Phillips spokeswoman said yesterday: ''She was not fanatical about
it but indicated it was something that should not be on display. She
then left without a response but we decided to remove it from the
window.''
Golliwogs first appeared early this century, at about the same time as
teddy bears.
Mr Sear's purchase is one made by the Deans company, one of the
earliest manufacturers.
Last year, Edinburgh store Jenners was criticised for selling golliwog
dolls after claims the toys were racist.
Yesterday, a spokeswoman said the store had always sold them and would
continue to do so.
Adverse publicity had resulted in increased demand for them. ''People
see beyond all their problems and feel they are childhood toys which can
be passed on. We have never had customer complaints and in fact sold out
a few months ago.''
Three more golliwogs were sold yesterday at the auction.
Teddy bears estimated at between #30 and 50, reached #260, #450, and
#165. An Emile Jemeau bisque head doll reached #3410 instead of its
estimated #2000-3000.
An early nineteenth-century engraved snuff box, which was estimated at
#400 to #600, sold for #2000.

CELTIC has warned its fans to beware of ticket touts after more than
6000 tickets for Wednesday's home match against Hearts, and next month's
Old Firm clash, went missing on their way to Parkhead.
The double cup finalists were stung yesterday when ticket printers GMS
in Sheffield reported that 3200 tickets for each of the Hearts and
Rangers matches had disappeared before Parcel Force could dispatch them
north.
Celtic PR spokesman, Mr Peter McLean, said: ''The tickets are cream in
colour and will not be valid for either match. New ones have been
printed in another colour.''
Anyone who is offered a cream-coloured ticket for Section B at
Hampden for either match should report the matter to Strathclyde Police
at London Road, Glasgow, telephone 0141 554 1113.
Tickets for the Hearts match will be on sale at Celtic Park ticket
office and the Celtic Shop on Tuesday and Wednesday when vouchers will
be issued to allow fans the chance to buy tickets for the Rangers match
on May 7.

POLICE officers were last night ''very concerned'' for the safety of a
13-year-old girl who has gone missing from her home in Dunbartonshire.
Anxious relatives have joined them in appealing for information about
Mary-Anne Gerrie who was last seen outside her home in the Pappert
housing estate in Bonhill, Alexandria, early on Wednesday afternoon.
Her aunt, Ms Patricia Gerrie, said yesterday: ''We are just
devastated. We have no idea where she has gone. We have checked out all
her friends and all the places she might have gone, but nothing.''
She added: ''She is a pretty girl and looks older than her age. She
could pass for between 16 and 18.''
Ms Gerrie, 37, has recently been living at the family home to look
after Mary-Anne and her sister Michelle, 11. The aunt said Michelle, who
was the last person to see her sister, was ''very badly'' upset by her
disappearance.
Michelle and her aunt have been touring local shops and taxi drivers
with photographs of Mary-Anne in the hope that someone may have seen the
teenager, who attends Vale of Leven secondary school.
Police inquiries in the local area have also drawn a blank so far.
The aunt appealed to Mary-Anne: ''Please phone home. Just contact us
and let us know you are safe and well.''
The missing girl is described as 5ft 6in tall, of slim build, with
fair hair and blue eyes. When last seen, she was wearing a light grey
T-shirt with ''Channel'' printed on it, a multi-coloured waistcoat,
black Lycra tights and white denim shorts, and black and white trainers.
She is not thought to have taken any spare clothing with her when she
disappeared.
Strathclyde Police have appealed for anyone with information to
contact them at Alexandria or Dumbarton police offices.
* Meanwhile, police are becoming concerned over a man who has been
missing from his home in Lanarkshire since Sunday.
Mr Peter Kidd, 33, of Dryburgh Walk, Moodiesburn, had returned home to
his wife Patricia and their three children three days earlier after
working away for nine weeks.
However, on Saturday evening, according to his wife, he complained
that he could not settle.
Early on Sunday afternoon, Mr Kidd sent his wife to meet his mother at
a local social club while he dropped the children at the nearby swimming
pool and returned home.
Shortly after, Mrs Kidd returned home to find her husband getting into
his car and saying he was going to visit his brother-in-law. He never
did and has not been in contact with his family since.
However, an amount of cash was taken from his account via a bank in
the Elgin area of Moray on Wednesday.
Mr Kidd is described as 5ft 9in tall, of stocky build, with short
brown hair, and was wearing a blue Rangers jumper, white T-shirt, jeans
and black trainers. He is thought to be driving a blue Vauxhall
Cavalier, registration number H160 NSX.
Police are asking anyone with information to contact Kirkintilloch
police office.

MPs have fallen victim to a fraud in which their portable phone
numbers were used without permission, it emerged yesterday.
Outsiders electronically ''captured'' the identity of the phones --
enabling them to make calls which were then charged to the MPs.
Labour's Brian Donohoe -- MP for Cunninghame South -- whose phone was
targeted, demanded Government action.
Mr Donohoe said he knew of two other MPs who had suffered and added
that there could be others.
Mr Donohoe said he learned of the scam only when Vodaphone notified
him that it was blocking his phone to outgoing calls after checks
revealed an out-of-the-ordinary pattern of calls.
His bill showed that over a three-week period calls totalling nearly
#180 had been made by someone using his telephone's electronic tag.
Vodaphone did not charge him for the extra calls, billing him instead
for a sum based on his previous average.
Vodaphone's main office was closed today for the Easter Holiday and
no-one was available for comment.
* BT issued a final reminder to its millions of domestic and business
customers that telephone codes change tomorrow, which is being called
national phone day.
The company is preparing to cope with hundreds of thousands of
wrongly-dialled numbers when national codes have a ''1'' inserted after
the first zero.
A team of 60 operators will man a help desk to answer calls from the
public on a special free phone number -- 0800 010101.
BT has spent #16m advertising the new codes but its latest survey
revealed that 25% of businesses have still done nothing to prepare for
phone day.

A DOG which responded to the call of the wild is home after 10 days,
not appearing to have enjoyed much of what it found.
The border collie, Tess, belongs to Mr Robert Shaw and his wife Alice,
of the Old Mill House, Evanton, Easter Ross. It wandered off from Mr
Shaw, a forestry manager, when he was working on the other side of the
country at Glenelg, looking out towards Skye.
The difference to its usual outlook, the Black Isle, appears to have
disorientated the dog. It was first seen a few days later at Glen Shiel,
heading across mountain and moor, more or less in the right direction
for home, but afterwards it started to travel too far to the south.
There was no more news of it for a week. However, after Mr Shaw placed
an advertisement in his weekly paper, a digger driver constructing
forestry tracks in remote Glen Kingie, near Loch Garry, reported feeding
the starving dog biscuits from his lunch bag. It then vanished back into
the wilds.
It eventually turned up near Roy Bridge, at the south end of the Great
Glen.
The man who found the collie, Mr James MacKenzie, 42, of Fersit, said:
''I just happened to see the dog go past the house heading in the
direction of Rannoch Moor. I knew it was not a local dog so got one of
my sons to catch it.
''Luckily, it had a collar with name tag and telephone number on it.
We gave the poor animal something to eat and drink until Mr Shaw
arrived.''
Mr Shaw's journey of 100 miles brought to about 1000 miles the
distance he had already travelled in futile searches for the dog.
Mr Shaw said: ''We despaired of ever seeing her again, so you can
imagine how we felt when we got Mr MacKenzie's phone call.''
Tess is being treated for tick bites and lameness.

<HEADLINE>Professor in urgent plea to redistribute nation's wealth.  Scots are warned on wider poverty</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978878721</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN urgent plea was made yesterday to redistribute Scotland's wealth as
the gap between rich and poor grows steadily wider.
Professor Fred Edwards, one of the country's most respected
social-work experts, said the very poor in our society were sinking into
apathy and hopelessness.
He warned that there was a distinct possibility of an ''underclass''
developing unless Scotland's wealth was more fairly shared.
''The big question now facing society is how to redistribute wealth,''
said Professor Edwards, former president of the Association of Directors
of Social Work.
''While the contented majority go on ignoring the issue, the prospects
for the people who are becoming increasingly poor are very wretched
indeed,'' he said.
''The result will be that the wealthy will not be able to hang on to
their wealth, they will become insecure, and the lesson of history is
that then redistribution takes place inappropriately and illegally.''
He said that Scots should pause to reflect on how other members of our
society were faring.
Professor Edwards, now involved in a wide range of social and caring
issues, stressed he was not forecasting bloody revolution but that crime
would escalate, spreading more and more to hit the ''contented
majority''.
''We are a long way off from anything like revolution and, at the
moment, the very poor are sinking into apathy,'' he said.
''Wretchedness is leading to apathy but there comes a breaking
point.''
Professor Edwards said that even the most sober journals like The
Economist now rated long-term unemployment and poverty as a major
concern.
He said the vast majority of the poor were opposed to crime and
opposed to being dependent on the state.
''People want to play their part in society with a bit of dignity and,
if they are deprived of that dignity, where does that hopelessness lead?
The development of an underclass is a distinct possibility but much more
worrying is the apathy and the sense of hopelessness. That is a
frightening thing to see in people,'' he added.
One of the biggest changes in society over the past 15 years was the
widening gulf between rich and poor.
One of the famous jokes at the height of the Cold War was that the
difference in pay between a Soviet soldier and his general was far
greater than between a Scottish private and his commanding officer.
However, since 1977, inequality has been increasing in the West, and
at a faster rate in Scotland and the UK than in most of its neighbours.
That inequality has even accelerated during the last six or seven years.
The bottom 10% in income from any source increased by 10% over the
last 20 years. At the same time, the top 10% has increased by 55%, said
Professor Edwards.
''It's a fact that the poor are getting poorer and the better off are
getting richer. That is now the major cause for concern,'' he added.
There was now a growing culture of contentment among those who managed
society. Indeed, many of the middle classes who were once politically
motivated had become more involved in single issues, whether economic or
environmental.
An example was the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which
now had more members than any single political party.
Also, poverty had not been made a major issue during any General
Election in living memory.
Meanwhile, the Tories had largely abandoned their ideal of ''one
nation'' that had made them acceptable to a much larger section of
society in the past.
Professor Edwards said he did not believe there was an underclass yet,
but added: ''What you have got is a situation -- and recent research
shows this beyond any doubt -- where poor people are fighting to make
ends meet and the absence of work prevents them from making the
breakthrough.''
He said that on the fringes of the poor lay the black economy and
crime.
He added that those involved in the black economy had a Robin Hood
attitude, self-justification rather than direct and destructive
intentions.
''The danger is, how far can you allow these differences and attitudes
to develop before trouble occurs?'' asked Professor Edwards, who warned
that the French Revolution had terrified the rest of Europe into
thinking about proper welfare for the poor and needy.
In the Britain of old, there had been no revolution like that in
France.
Instead, there grew up a middle-class social conscience partly based
on Christian values.
Political parties had, despite their differences, sought fairness but
the gulf between rich and poor that occurred in the 1980s had become
''noticeably worse''.
''Against that background of the rich getting richer, just think how
that makes those at the bottom of the pile feel so much more wretched,''
said Professor Edwards.

A COUPLE were yesterday tied up in their home as armed thugs ransacked
it.
The victims -- a fruit merchant and his wife who have not been named
-- were bound and gagged with tights and electric flex as the two
intruders ransacked their home.
The attack took place at dawn in a quiet area of Johnstone,
Renfrewshire.
As the husband left to go to the market around 5am, two masked men,
one armed with a knife and another wielding a wooden baton, stopped him.
They frog-marched their victim back to his home in Springfield Park
and upstairs to the bedroom in which his wife was asleep, before tying
up both of them.
Detectives investigating the incident have appealed for witnesses.
The attackers escaped with a four-figure sum before the couple were
able to free themselves and raise the alarm.
The couple were were still in a state of shock last night.
However, the husband said: ''These were very dangerous men. I was more
concerned for my wife than anything else.''
His wife said: ''It was a horrific experience.''

LORRY drivers criticised a ferry company yesterday while stuck in a
queue of 150 trucks waiting at Cairnryan to get across the Irish Sea.
The drivers, along with hundreds of Easter holidaymakers, were delayed
by a technical fault in P&amp;O's The Pride of Ailsa, which was due to sail
to Larne.
Some travellers went to Stranraer to travel by Stena Sealink ferry,
while others decided to sit it out at Cairnryan.
While holidaymakers were able to travel after a delay of more than
three hours, the lorry drivers, some of whom were carrying the Easter
mail to Ireland, were kept waiting for much longer.
That decision enraged many lorry drivers. One, Mr Albert Bryson, 39,
who had arrived at Stranraer at 5am, said: ''During the winter months,
the freight is the bread and butter of the ferry company but if the cars
turn up they give them priority because you can fit four or five cars to
one lorry space.
''So people that turn up at the ports once or twice a year are getting
on before us and yet they only come once in a blue moon. It shows what
the company thinks of its regular customers.''
Another driver, Mr Joe Kelly, 31, pointed out the loss of trade and
financial loss suffered by freight companies and asked if they would be
compensated.
The Pride of Ailsa, which carries about 40 lorries as well as 100
cars, is now running back on schedule.
P&amp;O European Ferries official Mr Dennis Grattan said: ''We tried to
minimise delays as much as possible and, hopefully, we are back up
running in time not to disrupt anyone's Easter holidays.''
Strathclyde Police last night said Scottish motorways were ''unusually
quiet'' but the RAC reported a total of 80 miles of traffic jams in
England.
In Scotland, roadworks were causing delays on the A74 at
Johnstonbridge in Dumfries and Galloway, and temporary traffic lights
were in operation at Wemyss Bay, on the Greenock-Largs road.
Ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne said sailings to the Western Isles
were heavily booked, with two ferries on the crossing to Skye.
About 3000 skiers turned out on the slopes at Cairngorm and Aonach
Mor, near Fort William. Snow was melting on lower runs of all five of
Scotland's main ski centres yesterday but a good covering remained on
the highest slopes.
ScotRail said last night that train services would be as normal today
and tomorrow, with a bank holiday timetable in place for Monday.

A YOUTH celebrating his 18th birthday escaped from a car crash in
Gwent which killed three school friends early yesterday.
The four were returning from Stephen Wylie's birthday party when their
car swerved off a country lane and plunged 200 yards down a bank.
Three of the youths died in the wreckage but it was not until dawn,
two hours later, that the carnage was discovered.
Mr Wylie, of Mardy, Abergavenny, staggered half a mile to a rail
station but remembered nothing about the crash. He rang his parents who
took him to hospital with a broken arm and concussion.
It was only hours later that police discovered he had been in the car
crash.
Police reached the crash scene near Abergavenny shortly after 6am when
a motorist saw the wreckage.
The youths who died were all from the Abergavenny area and sixth
formers at King Henry VIII Comprehensive school in the town.
They will not be named until relatives have been informed.
Police Sergeant Irwel Bevan said: ''It's a tragic start to the Easter
weekend. The boy who survived was very lucky indeed but he may not feel
that way having lost three of his mates.''

DETECTIVES last night confirmed that they were treating the death of a
man whose body was found after a fire as murder.
Firefighters discovered the body of former miner Mr Robert Blewes, 45,
as they tackled a blaze in a Leith flat.
Detective Superintendent Alec Brown, who is leading the investigation,
said: ''We are now treating this as murder. There were injuries which
were consistent with Mr Blewes being assaulted before the fire.''
Police are now building up a picture of the last movements of Mr
Blewes, a familiar character in the area of his home in Portland Place
on Wednesday.
He was last seen leaving the Vine Bar in Leith about 6.30pm that
night.
Police said they were encouraged by the number of people who had
answered their appeal for information. However, Mr Brown said:
''Sightings of Mr Blewes at any time during that day will help fill the
gaps about his movements.''
Mr Brown said the investigation was trying to find explanations to all
the circumstances surrounding the death.
Door-to-door enquiries were being carried out by officers and the
force has set up an incident caravan at North Leith Mill.
