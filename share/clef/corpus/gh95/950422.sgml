SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang and other leading Tories were urged
yesterday not to take their revenge for defeat at the local elections by
cutting funding for the new single-tier councils.
The plea was made by Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson. He
warned that such a course of action would be ''unworthy, unfair, and
politically suicidal'' for Ministers.
Members of the public had to be alert to the dangers to local council
services posed by a Government which, he claimed, now had little left to
lose in Scottish local government.
Addressing the annual conference of the Scottish branch of the
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy at Gleneagles, Mr
Robertson continued: ''It will be Ian Lang who will determine the
notional budgets on which the new councils' financing will be based.
''And it is Ian Lang who has been blamed and pilloried for leading his
party into the political quicksands of failure. That could be a fatal
mixture, but I sincerely hope that any vindictive reaction is swept
aside in the interests of the Scottish people.''
The Tories must resist any temptation to penalise or punish the people
who threw out their party by heaping burdens on councils faced with the
huge problems of changing to the unitary model, Mr Robertson said.
No matter how bruised Ministers felt now, they should remember that,
when it came to future elections, the electorate would remember with
great clarity any act of retaliation for the April 6 vote, he said.
He also told the conference that Labour councils, which now dominated
the new local government structure, would begin the biggest consultation
exercise ever seen in Scotland.
''We made a key pledge to the people that the way the new councils are
to be run will not be decided in advance, behind closed doors. That
pledge will be delivered by an open exercise involving the people in the
new council areas,'' Mr Robertson said.
He added that Labour would not fail those who had entrusted their
services to his party's stewardship of the new local government
structure.
He said this was why Labour would involve the maximum number of people
and organisations in discussing how the new structures could be made to
work.
Mr Robertson said the process would get under way this weekend, when
he chairs a meeting of new Labour council leaders.
He promised the meeting would not be a paper exercise to gloat over
Labour's successes, but would help decide what the priorities were going
to be and how the promised consultation exercise would be organised.

Producing hand-painted miniatures has launched a cottage industry into
the big time and made its premises a Mecca for collectors, as Liz Taylor
discovers
TO FIND Lilliput Lane, take Junction 40 off the M6 near Penrith and
keep your eyes peeled for a ceramic sunflower sunk in a wall beside a
gate. There is no signpost, but as soon as you enter the sunflower
driveway and see a thatched cottage on your left, you'll know you've
found the place that is like Mecca to thousands of collectors from all
over the world.
Lilliput Lane is the trade name of a company that produces miniature
hand-painted cottages made from a material based on gypsum. They are
eagerly snapped up by collectors, so much so that, although the company
has only been in existence since 1982, it has a Collectors' Club with
more than 72,000 members and its early or rare models change hands at
prices many times more than their original cost.
In fact, Lilliput Lane cottages have proved to be such good
investments that they have been tipped as the Doulton figures of the
late twentieth century. Some examples that originally sold for less than
#20 are now changing hands at more than #3000.
The enterprise was started as a cottage industry, with fewer than 10
employees, by retired Army officer David Tate, who had a passion for old
houses, particularly the cottages of the artisan or working class that
were built with whatever materials were to hand. Tate made drawings of
cottages that caught his eye, and produced scale models with meticulous
attention to detail. They were quickly successful, but he diversified
too fast and in 1990, when the company was in need of recapitalisation,
it was taken over by new investors and John Russell became chief
executive.
The average collector owns 21 pieces, but Russell has met fanatics who
seek out every model the company has ever made. Their collections must
be considerable, for new items are brought out every six months and most
models are ''retired'' and never made again after a year. There are no
''seconds''; anything that does not meet the company's high standards at
completion is destroyed.
Many collectors who visit Lilliput Lane are foreigners who say they
like the cottages because they summon up for them a picture of what they
think England is like. When Russell asked a Belgian woman why she had
started collecting, she told him she was suffering from terminal cancer
and found great tranquillity and peace of mind in studying the minute
detail of the cottages.
The company deliberately does not emphasise the ''make a profit''
angle of buying Lilliput Lane pieces. Nor does it become involved in the
secondary market, but models that were produced in small numbers make
the most money when resold.
For example, in the mid 1980s, a model of the village school at the
Cumbrian village of Cliburn was made in a product run of only 66 for
sale to pupils and their parents. Now it is eagerly sought by
collectors. Another favourite is a model of an industrial building,
labelled ''The Old Mill'' when it was produced in 1982. Only 10 were
finished before it was realised that it had been mislabelled and should
have been called ''The Old Mine''. Now one of the ''Old Mill'' models
will change hands at #3000-plus.
After the first takeover, Lilliput Lane then became part of an
American-based company called Enesco European Giftware Group Ltd. John
Russell and David Tate are still there, Tate as technical director in
charge of development of new models. So his search for suitable old
houses to miniaturise goes on.
Lilliput Lane produces a few models of Scottish castles, German
schlosses, and French chateaux, but the English cottage in all its
enormous variety, with wishing wells, crazy-paved paths, and herbaceous
borders, makes up the bulk of production. Among the 500 designs are
copies of cottages built of Welsh stone, Cotswold limestone, Kent cob,
Sussex wattle and daub, Midland brick, or Lake District slate.
Russell thinks the company's success is explained by the current
longing for nostalgia. ''Our cottages have a touch of romance; people
buy them because they typify the sort of house they would like to own,
or remind them of a place they knew when they were children or they
caught sight of when they were on holiday. The cottages summon up their
dreams.''
Each one of the range is based on a real place, scaled down and
sometimes cosmeticised to remove unsightly back premises of incongruous
neighbours. They have storybook names like Beehive Cottage, Buttercup
Cottage, Robin's Gate, or the Priest's House.
Asked if Lilliput Lane is deluged with letters from owners of
picturesque homes wanting their houses to be miniaturised, Russell
replied: ''No, we pick the ones we want to do and we don't pay the
owners. If they ask for money we say that if we were to pay anybody it
would be the original architect . . . ''
The company also makes copies of cottages that attract tourists in
their own right such as Dove Cottage in the Lake District; Anne
Hathaway's cottage; or the thatched house that was the home of the woman
who was the inspiration for Old Mother Hubbard.
The company's success of is due to shrewd marketing. Membership of the
Collectors' Club is encouraged by giving each member a free miniature
cottage every year for the #16 annual membership fee. Tours of the
Penrith factory are offered first to club members, and because it is not
possible for vast numbers of people to be taken round, the general
public is allowed on the tours only if there is spare capacity.
Another shrewd move is not to price the cottages beyond the pockets of
ordinary people. A small cottage can cost as little as #10, and one of
the most expensive models, like a whole section of the picturesque
village of Castle Combe in Dorset, will not go above #450.
If you want to visit Lilliput Lane and see miniatures being made, book
an appointment by phoning 01768 212700. There is a visitor centre, a
museum, and a cafe. The company is also holding a large annual fair at
Grimshorpe Castle, Bourne, Lincolnshire, on September 9 and 10.
MARKET TIP
THE bidders at an auction of antiques and fine art at Shapes in
Edinburgh last month did not take the history of one of the lots with a
pinch of snuff. A snuffbox made out of a silver-mounted ram's horn was
estimated at around #1200, but sold for #3010 because it was believed to
have belonged to Robert Burns.
The silver collar around the top of the horn was engraved with the
words: ''Presented to Robert Burns, Exciseman, Globe Tavern, Dumfries,
Jany 17th 1796''. On the same night, the poet was also presented with
two other snuffboxes.
It all must have been too much for Rabbie;  on the way home he fell
asleep by the side of the road and, said the auction catalogue, caught
the cold that developed into the pneumonia which caused his death. The
bard must have been a long time a'dying, however, as his end did not
come until July and is on record as having been caused by endocarditis.

Lesley Duncan descends to floor level and discovers a world full of
colour and Scottish craftsmanship
CARPETS are a household necessity, unless you affect the floorboard
look with a scattering of rugs. But what dilemmas they present. Should
they be patterned or plain, free-standing or fitted, uniform throughout
the house, or contrasting from room to room? Tastes change as radically
as fashions in clothes, perhaps not so much from year to year as decade
to decade. Most of us would probably make different choices now than
from those we made when first furnishing a house.
On a recent visit to the Elderslie factory of Stoddard Templeton (an
amalgamation of two famous Scottish manufacturing names), I gained some
insights into how carpet designers go about their business. Taking the
vagaries of public taste and expectation into account as they constantly
update their ranges, they are, of course, both responding to perceived
public taste and moulding it.
Colour is an extremely important component. To inspire their
designers, Stoddard's use a system of ''storyboards'', with montages of
four colour ranges. Much of the inspiration comes from the annual
Heimtex exhibition in Frankfurt. Chief designer Ronnie Wilkie showed me
the current montages, which have rather grandiloquent names. ''Brave New
World'' emphasises natural colours, leaf green, terracotta, burnt
sienna, everything with a rustic feel. Sweetcorn and dried seeds lend
emphasis.
Another montage, ''Earth Matters'', has rich, slightly earthy colours
-- rust, a touch of blue. Straw slippers and chillies adorn this board.
''Life's Rich Tapestry'' is very traditional, responding to the number
of Victorian houses and the resurgence in period decoration. Brocades
and velvets, jewelled picture frames, tubes of paints, and tassels set
the tone. The fourth board, reflecting the latest Heimtex trends, is
called ''Icons of Time''. It's very cool, very architectural. Among its
images is the Chrysler Building, ghostly silver. There are soft pinks
and blues, the restrained pearl hues of oyster shells.
Carpet designing is now carried out on computer. The designer can
change components and colour schemes at the press of a key. However,
with some 20 million theoretical colour variations, the personal taste
and judgment of the designer are still, happily, essential. An actual
carpet sample of the design can be electronically produced from the VDU
image. The information is then transferred to floppy disk, which can
reproduce the sample.
In the pre-electronic age, designing was by hand. Stoddard Templeton
have a fascinating collection in their archive: thousands of original
sketches, some dating to the mid-nineteenth century. Highlights include
original Voysey Arts and Crafts designs from the 1930s, art-deco work,
even a little Mackintosh original, boldly abstract in yellow, magenta,
and black, and probably painted with a textile rather than a carpet in
mind.
Among the most exquisite items are a set of Paisley patterns -- works
of art in their own right, with rich jewel colours picking out that
characteristic tadpole motif. Some are painted so skilfully in
watercolour to resemble fabric that I was astonished to find myself
handling mere paper. Also in the archive is that monumental sourcebook
of inspiration, Grammar of Ornament, by Owen Jones, published in 1856.
Its gloriously coloured pages offer an endless treat of beautiful design
motifs, from the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Nineveh, and Persia, to
the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.
In the archive library there is also a sample of Stoddard Templeton's
contemporary work -- a corner of the rich, red carpet with acanthus
design made specially for the throne-room at Holyroodhouse.
The spools for the wide range of carpets turned out by the 17 massive
looms in the main manufacturing area are still prepared by hand (how
skilled and painstaking the women workers are), although semi-automation
is being developed. The completed carpets are minutely inspected and any
minor flaws put right by hand.
Two ranges exemplify the firm's reading of current taste. Provenal, an
Axminster in 80% wool, 20% nylon, is gently patterned in two tones of
the same colour and scattered with small, sprig motifs. It comes in
colours from beige to navy blue (I would opt for the soft rose or
tranquil everglade) and can now be matched with flowing acanthus-scroll
borders -- particularly effective, I would imagine, on stairways.
Hopscotch is a brand new range, which, as the name implies, employs
plaids and checks, the patterns repeating on a much smaller and neater
scale than traditional tartan; it could look very effective in many
settings, offering a plainish impression but not showing up household
detritus as ruthlessly as starkly plain alternatives. There is a
variant in ''Maree Heather'' -- a darkish blue and green checked design
with occasional white, pink, and peach flower motifs. An unlikely
combination with surprising appeal.

Paul Young reflects on some technical advances to the rod that can
take the strain off an angler's casting arm
IN THE London of the 1880s, it was postulated that if horse-drawn
traffic increased at its current rate, the streets would be three feet
deep in horse manure by the turn of the century. Then along came the
motor car, and things changed.
In Edinburgh, in 1888, a small angling book was published by David
Douglas. It cost 1/- (5p) and was entitled How to catch Trout.
Written by ''Three Anglers'', it tells the Scots trout angler that a
rod of between nine and twelve feet in length is sufficient for most
rivers and recommends a reel with a ratchet of moderate strength and of
proper weight to balance the rod. The line should be of hair, silk and
hair, undressed silk, or waterproofed silk. The ''Three Anglers''
enthused over use of a gut cast with the upper strands thicker than
those near to the end, and suggested flies should be dressed on the
finest gut and not too bulky.
All this sounds not so different from the tackle we would use
nowadays. However, if we examine each of the components, we may find
there has been an advance in the hundred-odd years since the delightful
little book was written. Like London, things have changed.
Let's start with the rods. We still reckon between nine and twelve
feet to be ideal for almost all branches of trout fishing; but think of
the difference there will be between the tackle of 1888 and the 1995
version.
Last century's rod would have been made of wood, either cane or
greenheart. Mr H Cholmondeley-Pennell, writing in his excellent
Badminton Library of Fishing only a couple of years earlier, declared
that his preference was for a split-cane rod with a steel core, of about
10ft 7in. He was able to cast around 22 yards on a still day on level
ground. It had three ferrules and a combination of stiffness, from the
steel centre, and swishiness, from the cane. All these advantages
weighed in at 10 ounces.
My own nine-and-a-bit foot split-cane Walker Bampton (it was actually
10 feet until a car door blew shut and removed at least six inches)
number 28884 and made in Alnwick in the north of England, weighs just
under eight ounces. I bought it in the 60s and had a few casts with it
the other day. While not quite requiring a sling, my right wrist is
still suffering. How I fished with it hour after hour and day after day,
I do not know. Perhaps because there was no alternative.
Looking through today's tackle brochures, there are alternatives
aplenty. You will find many manufacturers can offer a 10[1/2]ft graphite
rod weighing around 3[1/2] ounces and there are some around nine feet
that are less than three ounces.
So, with a lighter rod, you will need a lighter reel to balance it.
And aren't we lucky in having a larger choice of metals than brass? Now
we can have reels machined from magnesium or aerospace-grade aluminium,
some with Teflon or stainless-steel disc brakes. These, too, can weigh
as little as three or four ounces, so with both rod and reel, you are
still carrying less weight than Mr H Cholmondeley-Pennell.
Now we come to the line. I've heard anglers talk fondly of the old
silk lines . . . the Kingfisher . . . but if you ask, few would like to
go back to dealing with all the palaver connected with them. Drying,
cleaning, and waxing are all things of the past. Now you can buy lines
for every purpose and in more colours than even the rainbow has to
offer, and you barely have to attend to them from one season to the
next.
THE gut cast with the top threads thicker than the next that was the
recommendation of our ''Three Anglers'' is now found in the myriad
braided leaders on the market, and as for the flies, I have already
written in this column of the variety of materials and hooks that are
available to the dedicated fly-tyer.
Cholmondeley-Pennell saw the future in metal rods -- fly rods made
entirely of steel. How could he and the ''Three Anglers'' have foreseen
solid glass, hollow glass, and graphite and boron, test curves, or
monofilament nylon and eyed hooks?
He, and they, might have thought it, wrongly, just so much horse
manure.

Swallows, with their blue-black sheen, fiery breast, and tail
streamers, are a welcome symbol of a change in the seasons. Hugh Ouston
admires a bird that has flown across continents to nest and raise a new
generation in our eaves and garages
SAYS the boy: ''Look, there's a swallow.'' Replies the man: ''By
Herakales, so there is. There she goes, spring has come!'' All this on a
black-figure Greek vase. Two-and-a-half thousand springs later,
Europeans greet swallows the same way. And no wonder. With its
blue-black sheen, its fiery breast, and those wonderful tail streamers
that enable it to twist after insects, no other bird in our shared
culture is such a simple, persistent, and welcome symbol.
Yet for much of those two-and-a-half millenniums, the very fact of
swallows' migration has been questioned. The Greek figure, arm raised in
greeting, does not say where he thinks the bird has come from. In the
first British reference to swallows, St Aldhelm of Malmesbury, in the
seventh century, described them in a Latin riddle as migrants.
However, even Gilbert White, the greatest eighteenth-century English
naturalist, had his doubts. The popular theory was that swallows
hibernated in the mud in the bottom of the ponds over which they skimmed
in their great autumn concourses. When they were gone the next morning,
where else could they be? Of course, plenty of hard evidence for this
was generated, too: conglomerations of sleeping swallows were netted,
clinging together, bill to bill, wing to wing.
Even when the truth about the long flight to South Africa was
recognised, not least as a side effect of imperial expansion, no-one
knew precisely where the British birds wintered. Then the following
letter arrived in Britain:
Grand Hotel, Utrecht, Natal,
27th December, 1912
Dear Sir
On December 23, a swallow was caught in the farmhouse of a farm 18
miles from this town with a metal label round its leg, with the words:
Witherby, High Holborn, London, and on the other side B.830 . . .
The naturalist H F Witherby was delighted when, the same winter, a
ring was sent from the Orange Free State which he could confirm as
having been placed on a nestling swallow by Mr Blyth of Skelmorlie,
Ayrshire, on July 27, 1912. Ringing recoveries of Scottish swallows are
common now from all over South Africa; one ringed as a chick in
Aberdeenshire had covered 10,400 kilometres by December 1 of the same
year. Presumably, the Skelmorlie swallows still do the same.
''One swallow does not make a summer'' is a common saying across
Europe, for everywhere a scattering of individuals precede the main body
of migrants, often by two or three cold weeks. Then, suddenly, one day
they are here, apparently materialising out of the air. Unlike geese or
swans, you don't often see swallows migrating. Yet one lucky late April
day, on a boat half a mile off the East Lothian coast, we saw every few
minutes a swallow pass at wave height, skimming northwards like the
lengthening days. The sense of movement and purpose in such visible
migration is overwhelming.
So our welcome is not just for the warmer days ahead; it is rich in
admiration, too. These migrants crossing the Forth were nearing the end
of such a journey, perhaps for the fifth or sixth time, over the Sahara
and the Mediterranean from Cape Province or Natal to an eave in Elgin or
a garage in Golspie. We still fancy that our house's pair caught a
corner of Nelson Mandela's eye six weeks earlier; the thought may well
not be reciprocated.
Swallows fly up over Europe on a broad front, reaching Spain and
Greece (spring has come!) by mid-March. By April 1 they have arrived in
Paris, Geneva, and Bucharest, by April 15 in London, Berlin, and Kiev,
and by May 1 in Aberdeen, Copenhagen, and Moscow. A few will reach the
Arctic Ocean a month after that.
Bad weather can delay them in a particular year, but you will each
have a date when you should look for that dancing flight over your roof.
In 1992, for example, the main influx into Scotland was between April 20
and 26, with 300 swallows passing St Abb's Head on April 23. Today is
the day we look for ours.
It is their domestic familiarity and their fidelity to their nest site
that make swallows such a powerful symbol. Their nests are not so
ingenious as the mud caves of the black and white house martins, symbols
of good fortune that Shakespeare adhered with such ironic effect to
Macbeth's castle. Nor are they so extraordinary as the burrows of the
little brown sand martin, which gave them their Borders name of ''butter
bank'' or bank biter.
However, swallows' nests are more intimately attached to our own. They
enter our open windows and doors to stick their mud-and-saliva,
feather-lined saucers in our garden sheds, garages, and attics -- and
even in our Nissen huts and pill-boxes, for like many species and not a
few humans they profited from our wars. Then their flat, twittering song
and the scolding double alarm will fill our yards and gardens all
summer. How that scold used to terrify our urban cat as the swallows
parted his ears as soon as he poked a whisker out of the front door. And
they always attacked, unsportingly, from behind.
The swallow's song has never been highly thought of. By sympathetic
magic based on their stuttering song and fluttering flight, crushed
swallow soup was supposed to cure stammering and even epilepsy. Their
contribution to the dawn chorus may be undistinguished, but in June
mornings our early rising to feed the baby was made more bearable by the
swallows singing from the rones. In the seventeenth century, however,
Abraham Cowley had a different problem:
''Foolish prater, what dost thou
So early at my window do
With thy tuneless serenade?
Hadst thou all the charming notes
Of the wood's poetic throats
All thy art could never pay
What thou'st ta'en from me away
A dream from out of my arms today . . .
Thou this damage to repair,,
Nothing half so sweet or fair,
Nothing half so good can bring,
Though men say thou bring'st the spring.''
It is a difficult question: would you swop your dreams for the spring?
THE numbers of swallows fluctuate widely because of the hazards of
migration. This is the evolutionary price they pay for exploiting the
insects of the northern landmass. In cold weather, swallows fly high and
in poor weather low, where the insects are, so grass-skimming swallows
really are an ill omen, at least for the harvesting farmer or picnicking
tourist. The decline of clarty middens and their associated fly
communities may have reduced their long-term numbers, but the evidence
is contradictory and in Orkney and Uist they are commoner than they
were.
Like all migrants, swallows breed as quickly as possible. Three years
ago our birds were slow; the second brood in September grew to a noisy
vase of gaping beaks, but with the first wet autumn weather the parents'
instincts for  migration overcame their need to feed a new generation.
They turned to fattening themselves, and swooped up to the noisy eaves
less and less. Over the next few days, one after another, we found the
half-fledged corpses in the flowerbed and learned again how carefully
such cruelty is judged to ensure that Darwin's laws are followed. There
they go: the summer's gone.

The humble turnip sparks in Jim Hewitson unending admiration and the
need, from time to time, to prove his everlasting love
TURNIPS, neeps, tumshies: by whatever name you know this ''fleshy,
globular root'' you have to admit that it's one of nature's cheery
products. You really can't look at a well-drilled field of neeps
stretching to the horizon without wanting to go out and cuddle a few.
Yes indeed, we've a lot to thank old Dawson of Frogden for.
Actually, the daily grind here on Papa Westray demands that come hail,
high water, or hurricane, I trudge North Rendall's sodden acres to
collect a fertiliser bag full of turnips for our hungry horses. One
standard fertiliser bag holds up to eight average-sized turnips, but
only three of the beachball variety. Not many people know that. Fewer, I
suppose, care.
So labour-intensive was turnip cultivation here in Orkney that
singlin' and hoein' of neeps should have been one of the labours of
Hercules. Farmers who opened their fields to the disruption of ploughing
competitions in years past got the bonus of staging hoeing contests that
saw many hours of weeding completed in double-quick time by the gang of
enthusiastic competitors.
But what of William Dawson of Frogden, the man given credit for having
introduced large-scale production of turnips to Scotland, changing the
face of our agricultural landscape? Through his efforts, autumn
slaughter of animals and salting of beef became unnecessary as
quantities of turnips provided mountains of nourishing winter feed. Even
more importantly -- and I trust you'll forgive the indelicacy -- the
volume of sharn, dung, or excrement produced by the beasts soared and
fair enriched the soil.
In fact, the humble neep is a relative newcomer to Scotland. It had
been an important food resource in Europe for thousands of years, but it
was well into the 1800s, at least here in the Northern Isles, before the
turnip escaped from the gentry's walled gardens and began to be
cultivated in acres of drills. Today, as well as being an important
animal foodstuff, it provides one of the ingredients of that Orkney
speciality, clapshot -- a smashing potato and turnip mash.
Several Borders pioneers of the 1740s are given credit for
experimentation with the neep before Dawson's breakthrough. They include
Dr John Rutherford at Melrose, a Mr Turner at Linthaughlee near
Jedburgh, and Mr George Cranstoun, then at Crailing. Apparently, they
raised small fields of turnips, both broadcast and in drills, but were
unable to persuade others to follow their example and quickly lost
interest themselves.
Dawson then stepped on to the scene. According to an Agricultural
Survey of Roxburghshire by the Rev Robert Douglas in the late 1700s,
Dawson had ''made himself the complete master of the best modes of
English husbandry, by residence of several years in those counties where
it is carried to perfection''.
Returning to Scotland, he set aside a large area and began cultivation
of turnips in drills in 1755. However, the farm was not as productive as
he had hoped, and around 1759 he moved on to Frogden, near Kelso. There
he found himself on fertile ground and soon had between 80 and 100 acres
sown with turnips. His excellent cattle, speedily ready for market, and
Frogden's luxuriant crops, soon converted his neighbours to neeps and
''recommended his new methods gradually to general imitation''. At the
parish church of Linton there is a wall plaque to this almost forgotten
pioneer.
* Neepnotes: One of the most marvellous sounds on God's earth is that
of a cuddy crunching into a turnip. Neeps grow in the strangest shapes.
My own favourite from this spring's crop at North Rendall was a big
purple brute that looked like the rear view of a Sumo wrestler -- with
all the appropriate appendages.

THERE was a time, around the launch of Talk Radio UK a couple of
months ago, when I had it in mind to try a new career as radio's
first-ever liberal shock-jock, slamming down the phone on anyone who
uttered the words ''political correctness'', tearing a strip off anyone
who rang up to whine about welfare scoungers or to insult the European
ideal, refusing to listen to those who regurgitated reactionally tabloid
tripe without first-hand evidence to back it up, and generally demanding
sweetness, light, and a well-developed commitment to human rights from
all-comers.
But after a few weeks' regular exposure to The Jamesons -- Derek and
Ellen's late-night chat-and-music-show on Radio 2, now broadcast from
Glasgow as part of the BBC's decentralisation programme -- I can see
that I have, in some important respects, been beaten to it. It's not
that Derek Jameson's opinions -- largely echoed by his missus, as he
calls her -- followed any predictable liberal line.
On one hand, he's against capital punishment and the veal trade;
indeed this week he presented a vivid short Radio 4 feature on the
animal-rights protests at Shoreham, which, with the luck of the true
journalist, he found blowing up virtually on the doorstep of the
''quiet'' seaside retreat he and Ellen bought there a couple of years
ago.
On the other, he's hopelessly ratty about trade unions, and given to
the kind of mushy sentimentalising about Britain's past -- poor but
honest, and we 'ad respect in those days -- that has been the hallmark
of banal middle-aged opinion ever since the days of the ancient Greeks.
But precisely because he is no-one's idea of an identikit leftie, his
programmes do produce some glorious moments of confrontation with dismal
old reactionaries who ring up expecting aid and comfort, and instead end
up with a fat flea in the ear.
Last Wednesday night for instance, following the bombing in Oklahoma
City, a man from the Midlands rang up to opine that at least the
Americans would know, now, why the British tend to be disgusted by their
support for the IRA; whereupon Derek blasted straight through the studio
roof, bawling, ''Oh, that's very nice, that is, looking at a 'orrible
tragedy like that, with all those little kids dead, and thinking ''oh
well, that'll teach them what we've been going through.'' How mean can
you get? That's rotten that, that is, you should be ashamed of
yourself.''
But none of this, of course, addresses the main Scottish question
about The Jamesons show, which is what on earth the BBC means by a
decentralisation programme which involves making a pair of elderly
confirmed Cockneys like Derek and Ellen travel 450 miles north, for four
days of every week, to broadcast a show, which is, so far as I can make
out, completely unchanged from its former London-based self; indeed it
is quite remarkable how little any sense of Scotland has crept into the
programme.
When I spoke to the managing director of BBC Radio in Glasgow a few
weeks ago she waxed eloquent on how the move to Scotland would
inevitably change Derek and Ellen, their frame of reference, their
guests, their agenda; but so far all that seems to have happened is that
the occasional caller asks them how they are enjoying Glasgow, whereupon
they say, ''very much, wonderful place, very friendly,'' and return to
the subject in hand. The whole move, in other words, might have been
designed to epitomise, in the most vivid and ridiculous way, the extent
to which some BBC decision-makers in London, simply fail to grasp what
decentralisation means.
To us, it means an opening up of BBC culture to diversity, to
different voices, to a whole range of geographical and cultural
perspectives from different parts of these islands. But to them,
apparently, it means a little piece of London taking up residence in
Glasgow; and demonstrating how, like a British colonial official
dressing for dinner in the jungle, it can survive in a strange
environment without having to change at all.

As part of an occasional series, Bruce Sandison and
friends take on Canisp in far from clement weather.
However, despite the poor conditions, some treasured
memories were rekindled on a magnificent mountain
SUE Fothergill does not give in easily. One month after a major
operation she was booted up, kitted out, and ready to have a go in spite
of the weather. Her only compromise was a robust walking-stick and a
promise to take it easy. The party, three women and I, huddled by the
car, fingers crossed, praying the storm would pass. At least I was. Our
destination, Canisp (2775ft), lay shrouded in sombre clouds high above
the grey-steel water of little Loch Awe in Assynt, Sutherland.
''Are you sure this is a good idea?'' I inquired, hopefully, thinking
of the soggy miles ahead. ''Will you ladies be all right? We can come
back tomorrow.'' So much wasted breath. They had started down the track,
eyes glinting battle-light, as though to say, ''do what you will, but
we're going''. I humped my pack and humbly followed.
I met Sue in 1990 when she and her husband, Derek, joined our fishing
party on South Uist. My wife, Ann, loves the mountains -- she introduced
me to hill-walking a micro-second after our first meeting -- but Sue was
new to the game. Sue did not fish and asked if she could accompany Ann
while Derek and I got on with man's proper function in life: the removal
of trout from their natural habitat.
Since then the pair have tramped many Hebridean miles; the Hecla
Ridge, Beinn Mhor, Corodale, and on mainland Scotland, Ben Hope and Ben
Klibreck. Sue plays the recorder and it accompanies them on their
journeys. Last year, she gave an impromptu recital of Scottish airs on
the top of Ben Hope, much to the astonishment and pleasure of some
unsuspecting French walkers and a curious snow bunting.
The third woman in the Canisp team that morning was Deirdre Shields,
from London, also abandoned by her fishing fiance. I had gallantly
offered to tag along, against my better judgment, but the die was cast
and as I splashed up the hill after them I thought longingly of the huge
salmon that recent rain would have undoubtedly encouraged upstream. The
River Loanan between Loch Awe and Loch Assynt was full of fish.
Canisp is a gentle hill, towering above its more glamorous neighbour,
Suilven (2398ft). There and back to the summit is an easy six-mile round
trip from the A837 Ledmore Junction / Lochinver road. Some walking books
say Canisp is ''uninteresting'', but nothing could be further from the
truth. It is a glorious mountain, full of hidden corners, secret
lochans, and crystal limestone streams; the perfect place from which to
discover the delight of Assynt and Inverpolly.
At the head of the Allt Mhic Mhurohadh Gheir burn, a mile-and-a-half
from the road, we paused for a planning meeting. The rain had stopped,
but the wind was relentless and there was no sign of any improvement.
The first time Ann and I climbed Canisp, our April silver wedding
anniversary, a vicious snowstorm chased us off the hill. Now we pondered
further progress over hot coffee.
Sue decided, sensibly, to return to the car, the ''rump'' voted to
continue -- by a margin of two to one. We struggled on across the broken
rocks and eventually tumbled into the welcome shelter of the cairn on
the summit. The wind was fearsome, knife-like and unrelenting, but I
chanced a quick glance over the parapet to see if there was anything to
see.
Magically, the clouds lifted, and I called on my companions to look.
The jagged ridge of Suilven drifted into view; Quinag towered over the
north shore of Loch Assynt; Ben More Assynt and Conival lowered to the
east; westward, across the land of the Assynt crofters, the sea shone
sullen silver. Cold forgotten, I gawped -- my own, my native land.
AFTER 10 minutes we scuttled from the summit, Ann running ahead to
regain body warmth. Me? I stamped my feet a bit and lashed my arms
around. A contrary, watery, sun broke through and eased our spirit as we
tramped homeward surrounded by a panorama of loch-carpeted moorland:
Cama, Veyatie, Borralan, and Urigill.
Heartened, I adopted plan B and steered the party to an unnamed lochan
below Meall Diamhain. My telescopic trout rod, reel, and a few flies
were tucked in my backpack -- exactly what was needed for such an
eventuality.

Invaders be warned as a famous brewery takes up new arms. Andrew
Mackay
inspects the ranks and pronounces them fighting fit
IN THE foothills of the Ochils, near Alloa in the heart of Scotland, a
drumbeat with unwavering attendance can be heard thumping out a
passionate message. Whispers of Wallace and Stirling, leaked from
cowering conclaves, linger uneasily in bars and snugs; frequent
sightings of shields, swords, and dirks in the hands of men with menace
in their faces heighten the anxiety.
It might look as if the Scottish Republican Army is mustering forces
and has decided to cross the Border with more in mind than to pick a
bunch of daffodils. But informed sources reveal that unwelcome guests in
some of the country's pubs are the cause of the unrest. A battle with
much bloodshed seems the inevitable course.
In this land, where visitors are accustomed to a warm reception, it is
hard to imagine why there should be so much sabre-rattling, especially
in peaceful and romantic Alloa. However, it is only those Maclay boys
again, brewing up trouble for some poor innocents who have happened this
way. The guests are all well-rounded chaps from that green and pleasant
land who rolled in on the last barrel. It is true that some are bitter,
but most are mild, with lightweights, heavies, old, young, and even the
occasional fruit.
Unlike the soor plums of Galashiels who slew a few wandering soldiers
when they stopped to pick some fruit near Abbotsford, the Maclays are
not inclined to such action. And chairman Evelyn Matthews, despite
having a name from the top drawer, has no aspirations of becoming King
of Scotland. Their plans are all in the pursuit of the best possible
taste, and making beer has been an enterprise with which they have lived
comfortably for more than 160 years. For them the invasion is a
challenge.
Territorially, they have the advantage. The Thistle Brewery (what
else?) has been on its Alloa site for 100 years, but the clan has had a
camp in the area for 60 years more. And for this time Maclay has served
a loyal following with beers and stout made with spring water from wells
100 fathoms deep. Barrels of 60/-, 70/- and 80/- have seen czars, cars,
coronations, vaccination, and Morecambe and Wise.
The Maclay lineage is exemplary, and Cellarman does but wonder what
this wee tasty barrel of rogues from England can do to harm the mighty
clan. Does it take a wheel to kill a fly? Perhaps not, but the brewery
has seen neighbours put up the shutters and in Alloa today, two's
company. The brewery has a proud tradition, and head man Duncan Kellock,
who considers his job to be an art rather than a science, has put into
the grist mill some masterly strokes to create class opposition.
Wallace leads the attack with an India Pale Ale returned from
sabbatical and whose thirst for battle could not be dimmed. His
immediate flavour and long dry finish gained him much support and this
spearhead, with an ABV of 4.5%, put Maclay on the march.
Soldiers by the barrel followed, Broadsword adding depth in numbers
with a full-bodied ale offering smooth fruity taste and a long finish
through the addition of malted oats. An ABV of 3.8% helps keep a clear
head in the fight against chains and slavery.
Completing the rising of '95 is Jacobite, a freshman who entered the
crusade on Easter Monday. He is a strong malt character with light hoppy
nose, but at 3.2% ABV his artillery is lightweight and his taste of the
action is likely to last only a few weeks.
Maclay has certainly mastered the art of putting passion in every
pint, by producing beers with a strong Scottish accent. The Alloa
brewery has also had some notable achievements since its birth.
Oat Malt Stout has a unique place in brewing history, believed to be
the only one of its kind in the world. It is made from a recipe patented
by Maclay at Dundee in 1895. During the Second World War, the brewery's
sole output was light beer. Coal miners and workers in industry enjoyed
this dark pint, which was low in alcohol but high in flavour. The
brewery produced 1000 barrels a week to satisfy the demand.
About five years ago, Kellock added locally grown raspberries to the
mill and produced a fruit beer. This was a brief adventure for the head
man, whose allegiance certainly lies with the traditional. However, he
recognises that there is a growing invasion of such beers, and their
popularity has been known to push the wine bottle off the dinner table.
It may well be that on the slightest raspberry ripple, Maclay will be on
the march again, bringing fruits with glasses to match.

THERE are certain recipes that hold a mystique for some people. Those
like me, lucky enough to work in a kitchen and endlessly cooking, tend
to forget that others are put off from attempting some recipes just
because they contain an unfamiliar method, or a procedure which they
think, mistakenly, is fraught with potential difficulty and has an
almost inbuilt high failure rate.
I come across these fears in people when I am doing cooking
demonstrations. However, I have felt the same about many recipes until I
got to grips with the various different obstacles which come in the form
of meringues, gelatine, souffles, and, one of the most usual, choux
pastry.
Now, there is absolutely nothing to worry about when making choux
pastry, providing you bear in mind a point or two in the method, which
we will come on to shortly. The great thing about choux pastry is that
it is so versatile. You can concoct several dishes once you overcome any
initial misgivings about your ability to make choux pastry -- after all,
if I can make it, anyone can.
Choux pastry can be savoury or sweet; probably the best-known dish of
all using it is a sweet version -- profiteroles with chocolate sauce.
But all too often, whether sweet or savoury, when you come across
profiteroles (or choux buns, but that sounds somehow, inelegant) they
are used as the carrier for their filling. I always think that
profiteroles should be flavoured themselves to enhance and complement
whatever you are filling them with.
FOR example, today's recipe is for profiteroles in a sweet capacity
but flavoured with orange, and caramel to coat them. If you were making
them to serve with chocolate sauce, you could still flavour the choux
with orange, because that taste goes so well with chocolate. Or you
could use coffee instant granules, dissolved in the water as the butter
melts to make the choux. If you preferred you could add a few drops of
vanilla extract (or [1/2] teaspoon vanilla essence) to the water.
For savoury choux dishes you can use grated cheese in the recipe. This
means that the profiteroles don't rise quite as much as they otherwise
do, because of the increased fat content. I also remove 2 teaspoons
flour from the amount and substitute 2 teaspoons dry mustard powder,
which does a lot to enhance the cheese flavour.
If I am intending to use a shellfish or a smoked-fish filling, I beat
a couple of tablespoons of chopped fresh herbs into the choux as I make
it -- with a preponderance of dill, if the filling is to be smoked fish
of any kind. Although most herbs lose much of their bright, fresh colour
as they cook, their taste remains, and it makes the choux taste much
more interesting.
You can use cheese-flavoured choux pastry spooned or piped around a
heatproof dish with a smoked fish in a sauce content -- like a good fish
pie without the potato. The fish mixture reheats as the surrounding
choux puffs up and cooks, and the two taste good together and make an
alternative to the usual fish pie.
When making choux pastry, it is important to cut up the butter before
putting it into the cold water in the saucepan. This helps the butter to
melt much more quickly as the water warms up. Be careful not to let the
water come to the boil before the butter has melted completely -- I
gather that this is because if the water does boil, it alters the
balance of liquid to butter as the water evaporates as it boils. I sieve
the flour (and mustard, if I am using it to flavour) twice. It is
important to add the sieved flour all at once to the boiling melted
butter and water in the pan, then to beat hard with a wooden spoon, but
only until the choux mixture comes away from the sides of the pan. This
takes only a minute.
Some recipes tell you to let the mixture cool in the pan before
beating in the eggs, but I can never decide if this is necessary or not.
If you are in a hurry and carry straight on with adding the eggs, you
will end up with a slacker mixture than you get if you let the choux
cool. On balance, I think 10-15 minutes' cooling time is better. As you
beat in the eggs you must beat each well before adding the next egg --
you will (or should!) end up with choux pastry with a gloss like patent
leather.
Pipe (or spoon -- but piping is much easier and you end up with much
more uniformly sized profiteroles) the choux on to a baking tray that
you have rinsed under water. This means that when you put the baking
tray into the hot oven, any tiny drops of water still on the tray will
evaporate in steam. This will help the initial rising of the
profiteroles.
As they cook, check them and turn the tray around if your oven cooks
unevenly, as most do. Slash each choux bun to release steam within and
cook them till they feel firm. Once cooled, they freeze beautifully. But
pack carefully in a solid container to avoid them getting bashed and
broken if some other frozen item in your freezer should slip into them,
as has happened to me with a plastic bag full of profiteroles.
Serves 6-8
For the profiteroles:
4oz butter cut into pieces
[1/2] pint water
5oz flour, sieved twice
3 large eggs
a few drops of vanilla extract or [1/2] teaspn. essence
grated rind of 1 orange
For the filling:
[3/4] pint of double cream, whipped with 1 tablespoon sieved icing
sugar
grated rind of 1 orange
For the caramel:
5-6oz granulated sugar
MAKE the profiteroles by melting the butter in the water in a pan over
moderate heat. When the butter has melted, let the liquid boil, and as
it comes to bubbling point add the sieved flour all at once and beat
briskly with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes away from the sides
of the pan.
Let it cool for 10-15 minutes before adding the eggs one by one, and
beating very well. Rinse a baking tray with water. Pipe the choux pastry
in even-sized blobs, allowing space between each for puffing up as they
cook. Bake in a hot oven, 400F gas mark 6 200C, for 15-20 minutes --
check them after 15 minutes, slash a nick in each to let the steam out.
Replace the tray in the oven for a few minutes. When they feel quite
firm to your touch, take the tray out of the oven and gently ease them
off the baking tray with a palette knife and cool them in a wire rack.
When cold, spoon or pipe the whipped cream flavoured with the orange
rind into each.
Make the caramel by putting the sugar into a heavy-based pan over
moderate heat. This takes several minutes, but shake the pan from time
to time and the sugar will begin to dissolve on the base. It will slowly
all dissolve into a pale golden caramel, but if you try to hurry it, it
will burn and taste acrid. Carefully pour a little caramel over each
profiterole. Alternatively, before filling with cream, you can dip each
profiterole in the molten caramel, but be very careful not to trickle
inadvertently any hot caramel down your hand -- it's agony!

NO-ONE who pays a visit to Hetland Farm, where Len Lungo settled five
years ago, would have any difficulty in appreciating his choice of home.
Perched high above the bewildering shades of green that make up the
Dumfriesshire countryside, Lungo's stables occupy 320 acres of
therapeutic perspective, climaxing with a view that takes in the Solway
Firth and Cumbria.
The soothing comfort of home just above the village of Carrutherstown,
however, does not immediately strike a chord as the ideal scenario to
hone the competitive talents of this ambitious Scottish trainer.
The impression is false. The scenario may induce relaxation in others,
but in this Scot of Italian descent there is not much space allotted to
smelling the flowers.
Within the Lungo breast burns a serious desire to succeed, not just
for himself, his wife Barbara and two daughters, but to prove that
training in Scotland can be just as productive as elsewhere.
He has made a fair start already, having improved his winning rate
each season to the point now where he is leading his rival and friend,
Peter Monteith, in the race for The Herald's prize as Scotland's leading
jump trainer.
Lungo, however, believes firmly that the Border over which he can see
from his patio doors should not be the limit to his or Monteith's
horizons.
''There is plenty of talent in Scotland. Scots are involved all over
the world and many of the big, fashionable yards in England, Lambourn,
and Newmarket have Scottish head lads,'' he says.
''There is an abundance of talent in the science of training
racehorses, but what we need is some Scottish owners to give support to
the new trainers.'' Lungo has had to put a considerable amount of his
own money into an attempt to prove his point.
This former sucessful jockey, who can be credited with giving the
leading UK jumps trainer, Martin Pipe, his first insight into the art of
training, has used the experience and financial base from businesses
outside the sport to back his desire to succeed in one of the toughest
of trades.
He started off in Carrutherstown with a few horses of his own, as well
as a few orders to buy some more, and hopes to be working next year with
around 50. The game plan is working, maybe even quicker than he
anticipated.
Lungo does not intend to add much more, preferring to protect the
individual attention he believes is important. ''They won't all be
prepared for the same time of the season and they don't all like the
same ground, so Roy Barret, my head lad, and I, believe we can give this
amount 100-per-cent attention.
''What we are doing would cost almost double at some yards in the
south. I think we are getting the message through, because we have now
got two owners from Ireland and others from as far south as
Kidderminster and London.''
He admits to disappointment when he sees Scottish owners sending
horses to England to be trained. ''They won't see them train and often
even the race meetings are too far away for them to watch them race.
''I think there is a little bit of a myth about the big yards down
there being able to do the job better. And as far as the racing in the
north of England is concerned, we are based only 20 miles from Carlisle.
All the north of England tracks are within reach. We very rarely have an
overnight stay which helps with expense for the owners.''
It is all a far distance from the time the 10-year-old from New
Stevenston started to have rides on a neighbour's pony. He didn't have a
saddle for two years, but then his parents -- getting the message --
bought him a bigger pony called Erin's Delight, which he claims he spent
two years trying to hold. He went on to win show-jumping prizes on the
horse and can recall spending a week of school at Hickstead.
His passion now clearly defined, he used to appear at Jimmy Barrett's
stable at Motherwell every weekend to ride out. By the time he was 13 he
was helping out with schooling at racecourses.
When he left school, he joined Barret, learning the business, had his
first race in a novice hurdle at Kelso. ''I was pleased as punch at
getting round, even if I was among the tail-enders,'' he admits.
He moved to Linlithgow trainer Craig Brown's stable, where he had his
first point-to-point winner, an old horse called High King, who won
three in a row under the young jockey. That persuaded Brown to give him
a real chance on Scarba, who was his first racecourse winner at Hexham
in a two-mile novice chase.
Next season he rode winners for other stables, like Harry Bell, and so
impressed an owner from Devon who saw him in action on TV that he
suggested to trainer Gerald Cottrell that he should give the young man a
try. ''I was claiming 7lb and the owners down there liked to have a bet.
I was teamed up with Leopardus and won four times in succession.'' That
introduced him to the deep south and, after moving to Paddy Cheshmore at
Drymen, where the trainer unfortunately took ill, Len decided to move to
Devon and Cottrell.
''I never bothered with a suitcase. I put a blanket down in the car,
laid my clothes on the blanket and went south.''
In a short space of time, Lungo had a very successful run which lasted
a couple of years. He had winners for most of the other Devon trainers,
was leading rider at Taunton, Devon and Exeter, and Newton Abbot.
It was about then that a wealthy, aspiring new trainer approached him
to have a look at three of his horses. ''He hadn't had any success and
wanted me, as leading rider in the area, to see what I thought.
''I told him the training regime would have to be changed. They were
show-jumping-fit but not race-fit. Two of them wouldn't like the ground
at the time and he should concentrate on one for the time being. I wrote
out a feeding plan for him and when I finished at Cottrell's I would
slip over and take him some canters.
''After five weeks, I told him to enter the horse at Taunton and he
won easily. It was Martin Pipe's first winner.''
Pipe has gone on to become the most prolific trainer of National Hunt
winners in history. ''Martin has diversified, improved beyond
recognition. He always had a hunger for knowledge. He would milk you dry
with questions. I helped him for a couple of years, even living in Pond
House, and I got him a good head lad who is still there now, Dennis
Dummett.''
Lungo rode Pipe's first half-dozen winners, but Pipe had a small
stable at the time and, after an awkward fracture of an ankle bone,
Lungo was recuperating at home in Scotland when he saw a Dumfries pub
for sale. He decided it was nearly time to pack up race-riding. By then
he was engaged to Barbara, who is from Essex. They were married and
bought the pub, although he continued to ride for another season,
winning on a couple for Sue Chesmore, wife of Paddy.
Then it was time to leave racing and concentrate on the businesses.
The Lungos bought another pub and a snooker hall. He syas: ''I took a
few gambles and had a go at building up some assets.'' He did
occasionally ride out in the early mornings, but he harboured the notion
to train three or four of his own horses.
He took some time to find a suitable piece of land to lay out with
gallops and stables. The one chosen was far bigger than they needed, but
it was too good a chance to miss. ''I decided to try to make it Grade A
standard. I had been with many top trainers, so I knew what I wanted.''
Up beyond the house and the boxes lie a mile-long circular grass track
and a six-furlong all-weather uphill gallop.
''We then knew we would need to attract outside owners to make it at
all viable.'' One pub was sold, another leased, but the Sands Snooker
Club is run by Barbara.
In their first season, they had six winners, next season, eight, then
17 and 27. This year he is on the same mark but has missed numerous
winning opportunities because of postponements. He still reckons he can
beat his total before the end, but above all else Lungo believes in the
patient approach. Horses are not hurried in this stable, even if the
gaffer is in a bit of a hurry to the top himself.
He and his rival for The Herald title, Peter Monteith, regularly
exchange information. ''Peter does really well with what he has got and
although we have been nip and tuck this season, we still talk regularly
and try to avoid racing against each other if possible. He is a great
friend.'' Len insists that what he and people like Monteith are offering
is value for money.
In the long term, winning one or both of the great Cheltenham prizes,
the Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup, would be Lungo's ambition. ''Every
year we buy half-a-dozen well-bred youngsters to fit our two-year plan.
We wouldn't find out what engines they have for a couple of years, but
we do it hoping that we might have found the star that puts you on the
map. We might already have him out there just now. The plan is to
improve quality rather than numbers now.''
He has every intention to take horses to the major meetings and be a
major threat. ''We know as much as anyone about this business, but we
need the horses to prove it.'' It would not be prudent to back against
him doing just that.

Athlete Tom Murray, who suffered from anorexia as a teenager,
represented Britain this spring in the world cross-country championships
(his third time in the event), has been Scottish cross-country champion
three times, as well as Scottish champion indoors at 3000m and at
10,000m outdoors. Here he describes his hearty eating habits on a
typical working day:
GOT up at half-past six. Breakfast was two Weetabix and a handful of
Kellogg's Splits (wee shredded wheats with raisins) -- about 12 in all
-- with half a dozen tinned prunes on top of that. I use soya milk. I've
just got a taste for it. I used to have sinus problems and someone
suggested it. I've been on it ever since. Breakfast was completed with
two rounds of buttered toast and a cup of coffee.
I started work at 7.30 (I'm a storeman with Inverclyde District
Council's recreational services) and the next time I ate was 10am -- a
large banana, buttered roll, and a cup of tea. Lunch was at 12.30 -- two
tuna sandwiches with coffee. At 3 o'clock I had a break -- a cup of tea,
buttered fruit scone, and a couple of chocolate biscuits.
I finished work at 5 and went training immediately -- a 10-mile run. I
live quite close to the countryside in Greenock, and went a nice
relaxing run away from traffic, near Kilmacolm. That took me till 6.30.
Dinner was pasta with tuna followed by semolina (no fruit, just the
pudding on its own) and half a pint of diluted fruit juice and tea.
I sat and watched TV till 10pm. Then I had another cup of tea, two
rounds of toast and butter, and two chocolate biscuits. Off to bed about
10.30.

FRANCES Atkins has spoken out at last. For three years, Scottish chefs
have been whispering about why she wasn't in Scotland. But the woman
herself said very little. Well, perhaps to her husband, to close
friends, but not to someone who could tell thousands of other people.
But it's over now, and she can.
Currently working in a basement kitchen in a busy restaurant in
London's South Kensington, Atkins has achieved a reputation among the
great and the good as a fine chef.
Three years ago she signed a contract with the chief executive of the
Scottish Tourist Board, Derek Reid, saying she would not cook in
Scotland for a full three years. She had been chef and owner of Farleyer
House in Aberfeldy, with her husband Bill, and during the recession took
on Reid as a partner. But a difference in marketing policies led to a
breakdown in relations and both the Atkins agreed to leave.
Signing that contract was something Atkins deeply regrets; for she was
made to keep her word. Sitting among the gilt mirrors and cream hues of
Shaw's, the restaurant where she and her husband now work, Atkins, 44,
says: ''There we were, in our home. We enjoyed it very much, and we lost
it. It is of great sadness to me that we didn't stay there, but the
recession came and we took a partner on. Then we parted company. It hurt
me, I have to be honest, but you have to look forward. I am determined
to go home to cook.''
Home is Scotland, but Yorkshire is where Atkins was born, went to
catering college, and took her first job at the famous Box Tree in
Ilkley -- the same restaurant that put Marco Pierre White on the
gastronomic passion path. ''I was there when duck a l'orange was really
quite something special and carrot soup was the latest invention. I
laugh when I think about it,'' says Atkins.
From there she went to Scotland and Dalhousie Castle, where she met
her first husband, now the eminent QC, George Carman. But the marriage
was ill-fated from the start. ''We had a very busy life. He said I had
to support him, and he wouldn't allow me to work,'' sighs Atkins. ''I
need to work, so my marriage packed up.
''That was 10 years out of my life, so I had to start all over again.
If you like, I'd missed the boat and I lost the time between my twenties
and thirties.''
While running an outside catering business she met her second husband,
who helped her with her first venture, Atkins, in Buckinghamshire. After
a full day working at his publishing business he would come to the
restaurant at night and do the dishes. ''When he did that, I knew he
really was the man for me,'' laughs Atkins.
The two moved to Aberfeldy and turned a private country house into
Farleyer House Hotel, with Atkins Restaurant and Bistro. The couple
still have a home adjoining the hotel and keep their dogs there.
Atkins recalls with childish glee her happiness when she is on the
motorway, on the way home.  ''Although I am not Scottish-born, I regard
myself as a Scottish chef. My home is in Scotland, I love Scotland, and
I am just down in London at the moment because I need to earn a living
and I happen to have a business here. I go back whenever I can.''
For the moment, Atkins is revelling in Shaw's, but dislikes London.
Owned by Sir Neil Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle, the restaurant's
cream-draped tables are almost always full. Well, they are now. Atkins
admits that at first the critics dismissed her cooking as provincial,
and it took time for customers to shake off the critical shackles and
taste the food for themselves.
''London's been very tough,'' she says. ''And being a woman  hasn't
made it any easier. In Scotland there are so many female chefs and jolly
good ones, too, so I was amazed that there would be problems with my sex
when I came south. I've encountered staffing problems. While a male chef
will say to you 'there's nothing wrong with women, they can do the job
just as well', in actual fact they don't carry out what they say. Then
they come and work for you and if there's a mistake made it's because
she can't do the job properly. You've got to be better than the rest,
you've got to be one step ahead.''
But being better than the rest means endless chopping, stock making,
and filleting which leaves little time for anything else. Thus is the
dichotomy of a chef's life: they love to cook, have to cook, but hate
the lifestyle; well, most anyway.
''I personally hate it. A chef's life is in a confined space, in
London, always in a basement working. It's not a social job. Therefore
it doesn't attract people who need people, but people who want to
improve their skills,'' says Atkins.
''I don't have a life outside the kitchen, but I'm very fortunate
because I have a husband who works with me -- therefore he isn't going
to object when I sleep all day on a Sunday and then go back to work on
Monday.''
Embarrassed as she notices the traces of dough around the rims of her
short-cut nails, Atkins smiles but refuses to elaborate on when she will
return to Scotland, to her dogs, to the ''open spaces'', and to Scottish
cooking. But the smile on her face tells you it will be very soon.

Scotland has staged something of a miracle in the cooking stakes.
Brian Hannan explains the reasons behind this renaissance and how a new
book, published in conjunction with the Scottish Food Proms, allows the
public at large access to secret recipes
SCOTLAND has been famous for its food for hundreds of years. Everyone
knows that the country produces venison, salmon, trout, pheasant,
lobsters, scallops, mussels, cod, cheese, honey, mushrooms, turnip,
lentils, pork, beef, lamb, potatoes, and haddock. But it is only in the
last decade that cooking has caught up. And in that short time, Scotland
has achieved a culinary miracle. From being the genuine no-hopers of
European cuisine, Scottish chefs have achieved a dramatic renaissance,
and now Scotland has more Michelin-starred chefs per capita than
anywhere else in the United Kingdom.
Despite this outstanding achievement, the true quality of Scottish
cooking has never been fuly recognised. Part of the reason lies in the
fact that no-one really knows what it is. We all know Scottish cooking
is not haggis and neeps, nor is it anything to do with thistles and
mists and kilts, and it is a million miles from the culinary myths so
enticingly marketed by the Burns and Hogmanay industries. Yet its true
character is not so hard to find -- you only have to look.
In fact, any country's cooking is defined by its top practitioners. If
the Scottish style has been undiscovered, it has a lot to do with the
lack of serious attention given to serious Scottish cooking and with the
lack of a comprehensive guide to the best in Scottish cooking. A new
book, The Flavour of Scotland, at last provides a basic understanding of
the new Scottish cooking style, of what is really happening.
Scottish cooking is rooted in Scottish produce. Of that there is no
doubt. But those roots have sometimes seemed like immovable chains. For
the one thing the chefs represented in the book have done is free
Scotland from the bad cooking perpetrated on its good produce -- to
remove salmon from the shackles of dry grilling, to rescue pigeon from
the prison of overcooking. Scotland's great chefs have shown that, in
many cases, the greatest service you can do to Scottish produce is to
undercook it, to treat it lightly, for the full flavour needs only a
little room to breathe and certainly does not need to be smothered. The
best Scottish cooking is defined by flavour, not by presentation. Pretty
pictures on a plate have never been the Scottish culinary style. The
great dark flavours of Scotland -- our venison, our meats, lentils,
broth, stews, pigeon -- just get in the way.
The extraordinary thing is that Scottish cooking has been reinvented
over the last two decades. That there has been a revolution in cooking
and cooking style is beyond question. The renaissance began in an
apparently unpromising location that had been taken over by a man with
no formal culinary training. But when David Wilson opened the Peat Inn
on one of Fife's many blasted heaths in 1972, he could not have foreseen
that he would become a figurehead for a new generation of chefs.
Over the next few years, as if by magic, three other people with
little or no formal training were also setting up shop. Hilary Brown, in
equally unprepossessing premises, started cooking at La Potiniere in
Gullane; Ronnie Clydesdale was setting up in a back alley in Glasgow's
West End under the guise of the Ubiquitous Chip; and Betty Allen was
starting off at Airds Hotel in Port Appin, Argyll.
The 1980s saw a further fluttering of talent -- Jim Graham at Ostler's
Close in Fife, Ferrier Richardson at October in Glasgow, Jim Kerr at the
Rogano, Nick Nairn at Braeval Old Mill in Aberfoyle. For a time,
Perthshire seemed awash with top chefs: Bruce Sangster at Murrayshall
House, Frances Atkins at Farleyer House (see also the story below), John
Webber at Kinnaird.
In 1990, Scotland had two Michelin-starred restaurants. In 1991 it had
six, including the Peat Inn, Braeval Old Mill, Airds, and La Potiniere.
It was an astonishing jump in standards. The 1990s could see even more
growth in quality. Andrew Radford has found a restaurant to match his
talent in The Atrium in Edinburgh, and last year Keith and Nicola
Braidwood, both under 30, opened up their eponymous restaurant in Dalry,
Ayrshire.
It has been a slow simmer, but one of the great joys of eating around
Scotland is that so many of the top chefs do not live in the big cities.
So for a tourist, the end of a city's boundaries do not signal the end
of good eating. Top chefs have been planted all over Scotland, mostly in
small towns and villages. There is a reason for this. When chefs like
David Wilson and Hilary Brown started out, their main aim was to find
somewhere they could afford, and that ruled out most of the city
centres.
As in France, the best Scottish chefs are chef-proprietors. They have
done their learning and their growing, by and large, in one restaurant.
They cannot easily uproot themselves and go. They have become synonymous
with certain places. They have proved that if you are good, if you are
better, the discerning diner will find you.
The other extraordinary fact about many of Scotland's top chefs is
that they are self-taught. Hilary Brown went straight from college to
her own restaurant, David Wilson was in marketing, Nick Nairn was in the
Merchant Navy, Andrew Radford was an assistant hotel manager, and Ronnie
Clydesdale worked in the whisky business. But while they all caught the
bug, they never fell prey to the mystique. They cooked it as they saw
it.
Some of Scotland's top chefs aren't Scottish at all. Frances Atkins
and John Webber left successful businesses down south to head north for
the quality of life and the quality and range of fresh produce. And a
lot of Scotland's top chefs are women, a greater proportion than
anywhere else in Britain.
The Flavour of Scotland offers, at last, a taste of the great chefs,
with a range of inspiring and easy recipes, turning their great beam of
talent on to everything from the humble cod to lobster, from duck to
courgette filo pastry flan. Each chef has contributed a number of
favourite recipes. From starters to main courses and desserts, there is
an opportunity to wallow in some of the best recipes in the country.
From simple hearty fare to more sophisticated dishes, there are
easy-to-make soups, terrines, vegetarian and traditional dishes; an
entire spectrum of exciting cooking.
Perhaps the most underrated part of Scottish cuisine is its puddings;
ice-creams, gratins, parfaits, pavlova, chocolate desserts, meringues,
mousses, truffles, all the great favourites with a Scottish twist.
Everyone has different ideas. Brown cooks her salmon on spicy lentils,
while Wilson prefers using Szechwan peppercorns and celeriac puree.
Graham likes his salmon with a salt crust and spicy cabbage with a
butter sauce, while Webber opts for apple and basil and a light
vegetable dressing. For some, salmon isn't king. Clydesdale cooks
halibut in a pine kernel and green peppercorn crust with red wine and
chocolate sauce, while Atkins goes for Mediterranean fish with roast
vegetables and Thai sauce, and Nairn reminds us of how wonderful cod can
be, served with mash and spring onion and chives. There are also recipes
for sole and haddock, sea-bass and red mullet, halibut and turbot.
Scotland's great wealth of game produce is well served, with recipes
for guinea-fowl, duck, pigeon, hare, venison, grouse, and pheasant.
There are umpteen recipes for seafood, beef, lamb, soup, pasta, and on
and on.
This is a book of secrets, too. Brown and Nairn tell you how to make
wonderful soups; Wilson reveals how to make the ''ultimate'' caramel
pudding; and Webber astonishes with his courgette filo pastry. It's also
a book of surprises -- you will discover why poaching beef is good for
you, how to make a wonderful syrup from Earl Grey tea, how to make
perfect truffles.
Scottish produce lends itself particularly well to vegetarian dishes.
There are a number of designated recipes as well as many that can be
cooked aside from the dish which they accompany.
This is a book whose time has come. The best of Scotland's chefs
cooking the best Scottish dishes using the best Scottish produce. I hope
you enjoy it.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair's campaign to modernise the party
constitution, including a softer line on nationalisation, was backed
yesterday by the Communications Workers' Union.
The sixth largest Labour affiliate announced that its members had
voted by a nine-to-one margin in a secret ballot to endorse Mr Blair's
rewrite of Clause 4.
Mr Blair said he was delighted with the CWU result
He added: ''Wherever there has been the widest possible consultation,
support for our new statement of aims and values has been overwhelming.
''I believe that ordinary party and trade union members support change
and modernisation and that will become clearer as the results of
constituency ballots come in.
''The message of that will be lost on nobody, least of all a Tory
Party desperate to claim that the Labour leadership is out of touch with
its membership.''
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown immediately focused on the 36,000 to
4000 CWU result as evidence that where union members are given a vote,
they vote for change.
This was an implied rebuke to the Transport and General Workers' Union
and Unison -- two of the largest affiliates which together command 25%
of the votes at next Saturday's special Labour Party conference.
They have lined up against the proposed constitutional changes after
extensive soundings of their members' views.
TGWU national secretary Jack Dromey, who is currently challenging Bill
Morris for the general secretaryship of the largest party affiliate,
emphasised yesterday that had he been general secretary, he would have
recommended the union executive to ballot the membership.
In fact, the CWU was the only union that felt it could justify the
cost of a postal ballot and even then only 17% of members participated.
Virtually every union is currently experiencing financial
difficulties. For a union the size of the TGWU, a full postal ballot
would cost up to #250,000 which would have to come out of its political
fund.
Mr Blair looks set to win the day at the special conference although
the position will become clearer on Monday when delegates to the seventh
largest affiliate, the shopworkers' union Usdaw, decide on their stance
after Mr Blair has addressed their annual conference in Blackpool.
This will be the only major individual union conference to debate
Clause 4 before the special conference.
The special meeting was deliberately timed so that the controversial
issue will be decided before the union conference season really gets
under way.
The executive of the second largest affiliate , General Municipal and
Boilermakers, is due to consider Clause 4 the following day.
Both look set to join the Blair bandwaggon which would then become
unstoppable and result in an overwhelming endorsement of the modernised
constitution, especially as the 30% of votes controlled by the
constituences are said to favour change.
The proposed re-write would include replacing the historic commitment
to ''the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and
exchange'' with the aim of ''a thriving private sector and high-quality
public services where those undertakings essential to the common good
are either owned by the public or accountable to them''.

ROB MULHOLLAND's work in architectural metalwork and furniture design
draws together his desire ''to combine the intuitiveness of fine art
with the disciplines of design in the creation of aesthetically pleasing
yet practical furniture''. No-one could argue with such rounded and
sound principles.
The result of all this is eye-catching pieces such as the Flux chair
shown right, in forged metal sealed in lacquer. Hand-made within his
workshop at Maryhill, Glasgow -- where five craftsmen find themselves
regularly challenged by Mulholland's new materials and ideas -- the
designs are fresh and innovative, stylish and distinctive.
His Sonic Boom Boom Bang (below right) and Spiral occasional tables,
while totally practical, combine a certain appeal along with witty
quirkiness.
The Flux chair sells for around #239 and its matching candlestand is
about #125. The Sonic Boom Boom Bang table costs #245, while the Spiral
occasional table is in the region of #199.
* Rob Mulholland Design is on 0141-945 2298, and stockists who can
order the designs include: Design Works, Gibson Street, and Furniture
Union, Frasers, both Glasgow.

THE Prime Minister's uncertain Commons majority is under further
threat following the suspension of two Tory MPs from the House over the
cash-for-questions affair.
Government business managers face a nervous two weeks as the
Opposition tries to exploit the Tories' weakened position in the House.
Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth) was banned for 20 sitting days over the
allegation that he was prepared to accept #1000 to table a parliamentary
question, while Mr Graham Riddick (Colne Valley) was suspended for 10
days over a similar allegation.
With the party whip already withdrawn from the nine Tory Euro-rebels,
Mr Major is already technically the leader of a minority Government.
Labour is now expected to try to capitalise on Mr Major's difficulties
by finding issues to debate which could draw off more Tory dissidents.
The party already has warned that it will seek a debate on hospital
closures in London announced before the Easter recess.
At least two Tory MPs have said they cannot support the Government on
the issue and the leadership will be anxious to ensure that the threat
of rebellion does not spread.
MPs accepted, without a vote, the recommendations of the Privileges
Committee, which investigated a Sunday Times report about cash for
tabling questions.
It was one of the harshest penalties imposed by the Commons for almost
half a century. It is understood Mr Tredinnick will lose about #1800 in
pay and Mr Riddick about #900.

EDINBURGH Ceramics has been established for 10 years and in that time
has become well known for its bright, distinctive designs. Susan
Dalgleish, co-owner of the business with her husband Douglas, explains
that she started doing pottery almost as an afterthought.
''I gained an A-level in art at school, but I didn't learn to make
pottery until after I'd left school and had a young family, when I
studied it at evening classes.''
Susan lived for a time in the bush in Australia, and used to make pots
as a hobby, using clay dug up from the ground which she fired in a
wood-burning stove. After returning to Scotland, she applied to do a
degree course at Edinburgh College of Art as a mature student, where she
gained a BA Hons in Art and Design and set up Edinburgh Ceramics with
fellow graduate Douglas.
''We specialise in wall tiles and mostly work to commission,'' says
Susan. ''Both Douglas and I can draw and paint, which is a distinct
advantage when it comes to realising designs on to tiles.
''We make tiles for fireplace surrounds and hearths, and for kitchens
and bathrooms, and we have also done various commissions for shops and
for private clients,'' says Susan.
At their workshop in Edinburgh you will find a wealth of different
designs, from geometric patterns to flowers, animals, birds, and sea
creatures. Sometimes these are painted on to the tile beneath the final
glaze, sometimes on top. Susan and Douglas have also perfected a method
of stencilling designs on to tiles, which speeds up the process.
''We find that people who live in towns prefer countryside scenes,
while commissions we have undertaken for farmhouses have usually been
for flowers,'' says Susan. ''We are often asked to design tiles to match
someone's Aga, or to complement an existing design of wallpaper or
fabric. Tiles are very versatile and can be used to effect in any room
-- around a fireplace, or in a bathroom or kitchen.''
Susan and Douglas have a large selection of illustrations to show the
different kinds of tiles they have designed and made. ''A popular
request has been to depict a client's house in a series of tiles,
usually to decorate a kitchen wall. We made a set of tiles depicting
different golf clubhouses for another client,'' says Douglas.
There's really no restriction as to what you can choose. Animals tend
to be one of the most popular themes, and clients have had likenesses of
their own dogs and cats captured in clay.
''Designing tiles can be an extremely lengthy process,'' explains
Susan. ''It can sometimes take several attempts before we get the exact
colour match we're looking for.''
Once the design has been agreed on and approved, it usually takes
about three weeks to produce the finished tiles. Prices start at around
#3 for a simple border tile to #25 for a handpainted 6in square tile.
For a larger design, four tiles square, of 2ft by 2ft, prices start at
around #400, which includes the design and artwork involved.

SCOTLAND'S largest seed potato co-operative, SE Growers Limited, based
at Haddington, has completed a reorganisation designed to help it become
a major force in the production and marketing of quality seed.
Under its new managing director, Stuart Richardson, the 250-member
co-operative is aiming to show a disciplined ''cutting edge'' as a sales
and marketing operation.
''We have quality varieties, grown on first-class land by highly
experienced and reliable growers,'' said Mr Richardson. ''Those are
benefits which have clear market value and must not be under-sold in
1995 or at any time in the future.
''Given SE Growers' broad production base, we already have
considerable strength as providers of quality seed. We also have
tremendous potential as a developer of new varieties. The sky is the
limit so far as our future is concerned, provided we succeed in running
today's business properly.''
The first SE Growers' variety to be declared open for trading is Maris
Bard, which is available to merchants at an opening price of #200 a
tonne for deliveries between now and December, rising thereafter in
monthly stages to an April 1996 price of #225 a tonne.
The co-operative's new approach to sales will leave members free to
carry out their own sales negotiations -- provided final confirmation
rests with the office sales team at Haddington. No sales will be agreed
below the base price set by the office.
Base prices announced yesterday are #160 a tonne for Pentland Squire
and #170 for both Ailsa and Wilja.
* THE Potato Marketing Board crop report for last week showed the
first signs that high prices may be starting to ease off. This was based
on resistance to existing high levels, increased interest for new
potatoes and a reluctance on the part of buyers to be overstocked for
the Easter holiday period. The weekly average price continued to rise,
but by less than recent weeks, to reach #299.17p a tonne -- an increase
of #4.36p.
Imports of new potatoes have already begun from Egypt and the first
outdoor samples from Jersey are now on the market. The Cyprus spring
crop is expected to account for imports of about 60,000 tonnes this
month.

SCOTTISH Industry Minister George Kynoch attended the launch yesterday
of the country's largest industrial development scheme.
The 100-acre Eurocentral Industrial and Distribution Park, at
Newhouse, Lanarkshire, promises to attract major European distribution
companies and the potential for more than 4000 jobs.
The park is a joint venture between AMEC Developments and the
Lanarkshire Development Agency, and forms part of the 650-acre
Eurocentral complex at Newhouse. The adjacent Eurofreight Terminal,
opened last July, heralded it as Scotland's gateway into Europe via the
Channel Tunnel.
Speaking at the launch, Lanarkshire Development Agency chairman Mr Ian
Livingstone, said: ''We believe 4300 direct jobs will come over the next
three years, with further potential employment beyond that.''
Mr Kynoch confirmed that three companies had already expressed
interest in the site, and dismissed any possible problems with the
future of the tunnel.''What is very healthy is that there has been a
good interest. Once it starts up it will roll on quickly. I am quite
clear that the commitment put in is going to pay off very well,'' he
said.
The development, designated an Enterprise Zone in 1993, will provide
distribution and warehouse buildings of 50,000 sq ft and upwards.
Already #2m has been invested in groundworks and the first 45 acres of
the site are now available.
A further #7m will be spent over the next two years developing
infrastructure such as sewers, drainage and street lighting.

A MAN was last night charged with the murder of PC Phillip Walters,
who was shot on Tuesday night.
The announcement by Scotland Yard came hours after police arrested a
woman in connection with the killing in Ilford, east London.
The man was named as Bernard Laveau, 36, of Willesden, North West
London.
PC Walters, 28, was shot during a struggle with assailants while
investigating a disturbance at a flat. His colleague PC Derek Shepherd,
35, was wounded in the hand and knee.
Mr Laveau is due to appear today at Redbridge Magistrates Court, east
London.
Police said a second man was still being questioned last night after
magistrates granted an 24-hour extention to his custody. This came after
the initial 36-hour period allowed by the law, and one 36-hour
extension.
After 96 hours, which will expire on Saturday evening, police must
either charge or release the person being questioned.

WHILE having every sympathy with the boy caught up in the crossfire
between his father and Glasgow University over his non-selection for
medicine, I believe the case highlights some extremely important issues
(April 20).
As a trainer of young GPs for the past 18 years or so, I and many
others in the profession have considerable reservations over the
criteria used by universities to select medical students.
In recent times there has been an increasing emphasis on academic
achievement without consideration of the many other important qualities,
which all patients will appreciate, required for a career in medicine.
Undoubtedly selection on the basis of academic achievement is
straightforward for the universities. It ensures a relatively quiet life
for those involved in the selection process and would have avoided the
recent furore covered in your newspaper.
Glasgow University is to be commended for attempting to select its
medical students using criteria other than academic brilliance. This is
a very difficult and complex task and there is, as yet, no foolproof
method of selecting the most suitable school leavers to pursue a career
in medicine.
It would be a great pity, however, if the recent controversy inhibited
progress towards a more sophisticated and rational process for the
selection of medical students.

IT WAS on the anniversary of the day Ireland declared itself a
republic and left the British Commonwealth -- April 18, 1949 -- that
John Macleod looked at Irish politics with a squint his spectacles will
have difficulty in correcting -- no compassion, no reconciliation, no
hope.
Arguably, more needs he the Divine than the optician.
However, rather than be depressed by John Macleod's Brotherhood of
Blood, your readers might turn to the inspiring forgiveness of the
bombers by Gordon Wilson, whose daughter was so tragically killed on
that fateful Remembrance Sunday in Enniskillen.
Here we have the model of Christ-like faith, hope, and love upon which
the future of Northern Ireland can assuredly be built.

PART-TIME study might seem one of the most productive uses that
unemployed people can make of their enforced leisure. To the Government,
however, it is apparently evidence that claimants have it too soft.
From next year in England and Wales the period in which people can
study and remain eligible for benefit will be cut from 21 hours per week
to 16. Scottish Office Education Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
has still to announce whether this will apply to Scotland.
Such a cut would seriously undermine skills-training for those
disadvantaged groups who need it most. As voluntary-sector training
providers who assist thousands of unemployed people to develop new
skills and find jobs every year, we would urge him to retain the full
21-hour rule.
Given the new powers, assumed under the Taking Stock review of
devolution, of policy-making at St Andrew's House, this is politically
possible as well as socially desirable. The cut in hours was justified
by citing changes to further education in England and Wales. These do
not apply to Scotland.
Much political capital has been invested in Taking Stock. Here is a
test of whether Scottish Office ministers have real leeway to shape
legislation to Scotland's needs.

WE have had a winter that highlighted any drainage problems. Lawns
which were satisfactory for years have become soggy. My own sloping
garden, relatively free of difficulties for 30 years, developed a
serious problem.
Nobody knows more than farmers about the eccentricity of drains, so I
called on Alan Bell from Milngavie to get the benefit of his advice. His
father, Archie, has done a lot of drainage contracting work in his day
and has passed on a lot of his know-how.
I opened a trench first, across the lawn, to find where the water was
coming from. It was obviously seeping out of higher land. At some time,
the old tile drainage system had been disturbed due to terracing to make
the lawn reasonably level.
Why the problem arose recently is difficult to understand. Rather than
involve a major excavation to find a broken drain, Alan advised
deepening the trench and lining it with gravel before inserting a
plastic drainage tile, with more gravel on top.
I had already found an outlet leading to a drain in the retaining
wall, built at the back of the house. Hopefully, all should now be well.
Several readers have been asking about drainage problems recently.
While I have given some advice, there is nothing like getting down to
brass tacks with someone who knows the ins and outs.
The main problem is finding an effective outlet. Generally it is not
permitted to link field and household drains. You can get into serious
trouble that way.
* A NEIGHBOUR remarked the other day that the weeds by the pavement
seemed to be pretty dead.
It is true that cold frost weather and rain have beaten weeds into the
ground, and this includes grasses and perennial weeds. Alas, I had to
point out that they will all be sprouting forth, with renewed vigour.
Very often cold weather gives them the incentive to grow fast. So
often the same can be true with weeds all around the garden.
* I GOT out my Hozelock five-litre pressure sprayer the other day and
had another whip round with a contact weed killer.
All weed killers don't work so well in cold weather. You can set weeds
back very effectively, however, if you hit them when they are gathering
up their resources for another spree.
Using any of a number of weed killers and a good lance-type sprayer,
you can go along lawn edges and deter grass from spreading into beds.
Do be warned: some sprayers do not cut off immediately. Dribbles can
be harmful, on lawns or on plants.
* IF you are quick you may still manage to pick up some special offers
from Bio. This includes slug mini pellets, Toprose, path and patio
cleaner, Speedweed, and path and drive weedkiller.
Ask in your local garden centre about anything of interest.
* WOOLWORTH, which has been into gardening since 1929, has a new range
of own-label products for this year. They will be available in more than
760 stores around the country.

TRADE union leaders are seeking an urgent meeting with Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang to try to stop British Coal switching off the pumps
in the mothballed Frances colliery.
It is feared that without the pumping, the Fife mine would be quickly
flooded and plans to revive the pit would be doomed.
STUC general secretary Campbell Christie said that if the pumps were
switched off, it would be ''one of the greatest acts of spiteful
butchery ever witnessed in the Scottish economy.''
He said British Coal should be forced to keep pumping out the colliery
for at least another 12 months so that a full study could be carried out
into the market prospects for the mine's valuable low-sulphur coal.
''We demand that Ian Lang intervenes for the sake of the already
hard-pressed Fife economy and for the sake of the long-term energy
requirements of Scotland.
Mining union officals say they expect British Coal to wind down the
pumping within the next few months. The present care-and-maintenance
programme is expensive and British Coal has been keen for some time to
stop it, claiming that it would be too expensive to reopen the mine.
The Scottish president of the mineworkers' union, Mr George Bolton,
disagrees. He says that a reopened mine would provide 1000 jobs for the
Fife economy at a time when jobs were being lost at Rosyth.
It had been hoped that the Forth River Purification Board would have
insisted on the pumping being kept going because of the threat of
pollution spreading to the water supply from a flooded mine. However, a
detailed technical study shows that controlled flooding of the old
workings can take place without polluting nearby rivers, the board
claimed yesterday.
Mining (Scotland), the union-backed private company which has taken
over the other Scottish coalfields, may be interested in reopening
Frances. However, it could only consider it if the detailed analysis on
its future was actually carried out.
The STUC's demand to meet Mr Lang came at the end of the union
movement's annual congress in Perth.
During the week-long event, delegates agreed to continue campaigns for
the introduction of a national minimum wage, protection of education and
other services during local government reform, a greater drive for full
employment and support for the workers facing redundancy at Rolls-Royce
and Dawson International.
Union leaders also want to spend time convincing employers that a
Scottish Parliament would be beneficial for business.

THIS is our magic garden, wrote Jim and Doreen Galbraith of the
village of Bothwell -- obviously keen to show other Herald readers the
natural delights that grow ''with a little tender care'' around their
100-year-old cottage home only 100yds from the main road. ''Our garden
is happily festooned with birds and squirrels and, now, the
newly-arrived daffodils. Soon they will be joined by a host of red
tulips which seem to appear from nowhere.'' Magic, indeed. But we think
the most magical aspect of the Galbraiths' garden is the way it so
dramatically illustrates the changing seasons -- from winter (late
January, above) to spring (this week, below).

WITH Easter out of the way and the weather hotting up just a little
bit, it is time to make a bold start in the greenhouse. In many cases it
may have been lying idle since November or December when you picked the
last of the tomatoes.
First and foremost, check that no panes of glass are missing. If so,
get down to your local glass supplier and buy the necessary replacement
panes, checking the size needed accurately.
I can never make a very good job of glass cutting, and usually end up
breaking more than I cut. Glass is expensive and it is better to let a
professional do this work.
Don't be tempted to emulate my son-in-law and use sheets of PVC, which
is not rigid enough to avoid flapping and blowing out with the first
gale.
You may find glazing clips need renewal. If so, go to your local
garden centre specialising in greenhouses. See if they have suitable
clips. Otherwise, you may need to write away to a manufacturer.
Now get all the accumulated bits and pieces out of the greenhouse,
especially from benches. You will very soon need space. Having done
this, it is time to decide what you can best achieve for the level of
heat you can provide.
It is remarkable what can be done in a completely unheated greenhouse.
A standby heater with thermostat, to avoid drastic dips in night
temperatures, is a big bonus.
With no heat you can sow seeds of the cabbage family, sown thinly, to
avoid pricking out. Remember to label everything. Cabbages, Brussels
sprouts, cauliflowers, and calabrese all look very much alike in the
seedling stage.
There is still time to sow leeks, especially as they may not be
planted out of doors until June. That is when early potatoes are lifted.
You have time to sow onions, too, but it is late to get real whoppers.
If you are keen on tomatoes, and simply buy in plants, don't risk this
without some heat for a few weeks yet. Cold soil or compost checks to
tomato plants can be fatal. Especially when plants come from a warm
nursery where they were in temperatures of 55[DEG]-60[DEG]F overnight.
If you are prepared to use heat, put it on for a few days to warm up
borders or growing bags before setting out the plants. That lets them
grow away without any nasty check. Otherwise it can initiate root fungal
disease, causing wilting and death.
A sure sign that all is not well is when seed leaves at the base
yellow and drop off. This is accompanied by ''bumping'' from the stem
just above soil level. This is the plant trying to send out new roots to
compensate for damaged aerial ones.
It is late to raise the full range of bedding plants such as
antirrhinum, lobelia, and alyssum. You can get plantlets and grow on
under cool conditions with perhaps a standby heater at night.
Some bedding plants such as French marigolds can be damaged very
easily by frost. You may need to space out plantlets and make sure that
the compost is warm, by having it in the greenhouse a few days early,
preferably spread in a shallow layer.
If you are worried about delays in sowing hardy annuals, directly out
of doors, then sow in pots. They should come to no harm in a cold
greenhouse. Watch for any drying out during the day.
You may want to take advantage and buy in from supermarkets. That
should not be too long now. Some establishments, eager for early sales,
put them on the market far too soon.
Hold these plants in a cool greenhouse until well into May, then they
can be planted out safely in most districts.
Bedding plants purchased early can be rather soft, however, and prone
to cold damage. It might be advisable to have your standby heater to
keep out frost.
There is plenty of other activity for the cold or nearly cold
greenhouse. Start dahlia tubers. Take cuttings of chrysanthemums from
over-wintered stools.
This kind of thing does not require much heat and the bonus is that it
is pleasant to work in the greenhouse with a cold wind out of doors.

Living on the jazz side leaves broadcaster Colin Bell puzzled at
times. Yet, as he tells Keith Moore, he intends to continue an odyssey
that began when he was but a lad
YOU could say that all writer and broadcaster Colin Bell wants is to
live on the jazz-side of life. ''It's the most consistently important
thing in my life, apart from food. I feel happier for the things people
play, and yet it's a mystery; music doesn't carry information, or help
make a living; there's no practical reason for it, but it's better than
books. I mean, Shakespeare's all right, but not as good as Lionel
Hampton.''
Bell's jazz odyssey began at the age of 10 with Mugsy Spannier's Mouth
Blues on 78rpm, and for Bell, the journey has yet to end. ''Only money
prevents me buying records,'' he rues.
Bell and his wife had kindly invited mer for supper. He is a witty
conversationalist, and jazz aficionado, and told me proudly that Gerry
Mulligan once stayed at this house and that Max Roach once introduced
him to Dizzy Gillespie in enthusiastic terms.
He has a study containing a collection of CDs. ''I resisted buying a
CD for years, then the family bought me one last year. But given the
price of discs, I won't buy them unless they offer value for money and
give more than 60 minutes of music.''
The front room, however, is a CD-free zone. In a bay window, behind a
handsome grand piano, are racks containing one mighty fine jazz
collection -- mostly original releases, resplendent in their
contemporary and now fashionable sleeves.
A penchant for wee-small-hours-of-the-morning style vocalists is
immediately evident; Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Sarah Vaughan, Peggy
Lee. But most favourite of all is Annie Ross and one particular album we
played right through, Annie Ross Sings With Mulligan on Vogue Records,
featuring Art Farmer and Chet Baker.
It's splendid stuff and new to the ?Inspector's ears. Bell wallowed in
Ross's Fitzgerald-influenced style and, shimmying about the floor in
perfect time to I Feel Pretty, revealed: ''To me, Annie will always be
28, she's wonderful.''
His other musical weakness is big bands. ''Big bands doing rather
vulgar things,'' he says, and hauls out a copy of Jivin' The Vibes with
Lionel Hampton and His Orchestra. I could only agree.
Next up, from a pile lying on top of the piano, is Mose Allison's Do
Nothing Till You Hear From Me from the album Autumn Song.
In stern tones, Bell tells me: ''Years ago, Allison was considered a
degenerate taste, one not to be recommended. Some said it was almost
country.'' And, as if immediately ignoring the last statement, he
indulged in a bit of finger-snapping and some more neat footwork.
As a student at Cambridge in the late fifties, Bell, studying history,
was, and still is, a keen trombonist. He described the thriving jazz
scene at his college. ''The band was so good, it was harder to get into
it than the boat-race team.''
To Bell's recollection, there is only one record he has lost and never
managed to replace. ''It was at a party.'' (Fidelity Inspector warning:
After children and the break-up of relationships, parties are the
greatest threat to the health of your record collection.) ''Someone
stole my copy of Dicky Wells in Paris, featuring Django Rheinhard,
although it's encouraging to know that one of my guests had the good
taste to realise it was worth pinching.''
It's an unfair question to ask most music fans, but one always worth a
shot: What's your most favourite song? Without hesitation, he muses:
''Jazz always brings a smile to my face, an appreciative smile, and when
I'm buried, or resurrected, it will have to be to the noise of Bunny
Berrigan playing I Can't Get Started.
The Fidelity Inspector had to admit to having never heard it, and
suggested he put it on the turntable. In true style, Bell retorted that
I wasn't old enough to be exposed to it for the first time. Instead, we
returned to Annie Ross and Gerry Mulligan and some more red wine. The
Jazz Life indeed.

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown yesterday called on Rob McKinnon to add
back-up to his European Championship squad as he prepared for the
possible loss of another Motherwell man, Brian Martin, as well as
Celtic's Paul McStay.
Brown is hopeful yet that McStay, who has an ankle injury, will make
the trip to San Marino on Monday, but felt it wise to bring in another
player just in case.
''I spoke to Tommy Burns this morning and he tells me that Paul will
turn up tomorrow, still hoping that he will be able to play, but we will
have to wait to see what the progress is,'' said the manager.
In Martin's case there is not quite so much optimism. His manager,
Alex McLeish, said yesterday that the defender was still feeling pain
from the recurrence of the calf injury which forced him out of the
Scotland reckoning last time.
''In both players' cases, they will have to display full fitness
before we take them with us to San Marino but, especially in Paul's
situation, we will be prepared to give him extra time, as we do not
leave for San Marino until Monday lunchtime.''
McStay, a major player in Brown's plans for the qualifying game,
always has been a quick healer. ''If the doctor says that more time
could make a difference then we would allow that.''
McKinnon, who has had one cap for his country, when he played against
Malta in November, 1993, has had a remarkably consistent season with
Motherwell, having missed only six games. He has had a couple of
Scotland B caps but it would only be in emergency that he could expect
to play for the top side.
However, if there are further problems over the weekend the Motherwell
man might move up the queue. Brown will wait to see how the two players
involved in matches last night, Pat Nevin of Tranmere, who lost 2-0 at
home to Southend, and John McGinlay of Bolton, who went down 2-1 at
rivals Reading, have come through. Apart from a booking for dissent for
Nevin, neither appears to have suffered any mishap.
The manager has permitted both to join the squad tomorrow, 24 hours
later than the others, because they will appreciate the rest rather than
travel today. ''If we have any problems with them we would have to think
about another addition to the squad, but if it is to be a back-up player
who will sit in the stand, it will be a youngster.''
Brown, aware as anybody else that Scotland are expected to win
comfortably against San Marino, had hoped to have McStay's passing
ability as a major contribution to opening up what will be a packed
defence.
''His talent for playing these type of passes would be very useful. I
can remember in particular three such brilliant passes from him, one
that led to our first goal against Finland, one that led to Celtic's
penalty in the cup against Kilmarnock, and the pass that let Willie
Falconer in to score against Hibs.''
Brown also pointed out that the Celtic captain had an excellent game
in the qualifying match against Russia in Moscow last month.
Martin had been in line for a cap against Greece in Athens before the
turn of the year when he first suffered the calf tear that has returned
this week. He had to call off then but returned to club action and has
been in good form since, but looks as if he is about to be unlucky
again.
Brown will not necessarily make any decisions about the pool today,
when the players gather for training at Love Street, Paisley.
His decision to call in McKinnon early was prompted by a problem he
had last month when he wanted to add Phil O'Donnell as a back-up, but
had difficulty contacting the Celtic manager. ''When there is no
premier-division programme the managers can go off anywhere at the
weekend and it can be hard to reach them,'' explained Brown.

The death of trumpet virtuoso Yank Lawson, universally loved by his
fellow musicians, evokes in Ken Gallacher fond memories of the man with
an unmistakable sound
HUMPHREY Lyttleton, that icon of British jazz, broadcast a memorable
tribute to the late Yank Lawson the other week. Memorable because it was
one trumpeter's lament to another. Memorable, too, because it was a
heartfelt progamme that said so much about Lawson the man as well as
Lawson the trumpet giant.
Yank was, said Humph, universally loved by his fellow musicians; when
you know the personal jealousies and professional rivalries that can
often scar relationships in the music business, you realise the extent
of that statement.
There was no exaggeration, either. In New York last month I met
musician after musician who expressed deep and personal regret about
Yank's death. By the time he died, Yank had been a long time gone from
the New York scene he had graced for a quarter of a century. He had
moved to Maine for a spell, then on to Indianapolis, where he lived out
his life and kept himself ready for the gigs that were still on offer
until he was into his eighties.
Humph, somehow, was able to encapsulate Yank's career into an
hour-long programme. He did so admirably. I know more than one person
who was in tears as he played the records and told the stories that
helped all of us who knew Yank, and loved him, remember him that little
bit better.
One of my daughters -- the one he taught to mix the meanest of dry
martinis: ''Just a whisper of Vermouth'' he cautioned her -- called when
the programme ended.''I remember Yank telling me that story about
Louis,''she said. ''It was just like he was back . . . ''
I remember it, too. It was a story Yank loved to tell. The time he was
asked to take the role of Joe Oliver, playing alongside Louis Armstrong
in his Autobiography album. And Yank was late for the gig. Not just late
-- but seriously late. Hours late!
And his idol, Armstrong, was being kept waiting. It was, Yank always
recalled, a nightmare for him. ''The thought of playing with Louis and
being his choice to play the Oliver part was a big, big thing for me,''
he would remember later. ''And there I was, stuck uptown working on the
Perry Como Show and having to do take after take and phoning down to the
recording studio to make excuses.
''Then, when I got there, Louis just took over. He had a huge spread
laid out, red beans and rice and all of the New Orleans things he liked.
He was just so wonderful to me. He told me to have something to eat,
relax, and then to play. He was marvellous . . . ''
For Lawson, it was a high point of a career that spanned more than 50
years of American popular music and brought him friendships with some of
the actors and writers and sportsmen who enjoyed the music he played
with Bob Crosby, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, and other leaders of the
Swing era.
Yank, for me, led an almost idyllic life until the stroke that left
his wife, Harriet, incapacitated for so long. He played tennis with
Donald Budge, and when Ken Venturi won the US Open he celebrated with
Yank at Eddie Condon's club later. Yank's drinking buddies included
Johnny Mercer and Hoagy Carmichael, Phil Harris and Buddy Ebsen.
Once, at the l00 Club in London when Yank was co-leading the World's
Greatest Jazzband with his longtime, almost lifetime partner, bassist
Bob Haggart, Buddy Rich came down to sit in. Yank pulled rank on him
that night. After all, he had been a star with Tommy Dorsey when the
drummer joined as a raw kid. Sure, Buddy played with the band that night
-- and it was a memorable outing -- but Yank was in charge.
As Humph said, he was one of the great small band leaders, a trumpeter
with an unmistakable sound and an iron lip, a capacity to play ballads
or up-tempo numbers with equal facility. I first met Yank in l966 when
Pee Wee Russell took me to Eddie Condon's uptown club and Yank came
along to play with the band led by Peanuts Hucko. Lou McGarity and Cutty
Cutshall were also on the stand that night and, then later, I saw the
WGJB at the Rainbow Grill and on subsequent tours of Great Britain.
He played at my eldest daughter's wedding in Glasgow, and the last
time I saw him he waa still playing superbly at Bob Haggart's eightieth
birthday bash in Florida a year ago.
When he died last month, I remembered John O'Hara on the day George
Gershwin died. He wrote: ''George Gershwin died yesterday, but I don't
have to believe that if I don't want to . . .''
I felt the same about Yank Lawson. So did Humph. So did many, many
others.

EVEN the longest journey begins with a single step and today at
Murrayfield Gavin Hastings and his Scottish rugby pilgrims set out in
earnest on the 6000-mile trail to the World Cup in South Africa with a
game against Romania.
The Scots know to their cost that these warm-up games tend to become
just a bit too hot for comfort and the Romanians, despite their 24-15
defeat by France a fortnight ago, will be treated with much respect.
The Scots will need no reminding that four years ago, during the
run-up to the last World Cup, Scotland travelled to Romania and came to
grief by 18-12.
However, Romania have never won on their two previous visits to
Murrayfield and it would be a major disappointment if the Scots were to
stumble.
Yesterday, Scotland manager Duncan Paterson declared that it was the
side's intention to play fluent rugby, but he ackowledged that, in order
to achieve that ambition, the Scots have firstly to get the basics
right.
He said that the squad was looking at the game as being the next step
along the way to South Africa, and when he was asked what kind of step
he hoped it would be, Paterson replied that he earnestly hoped that it
would be as big a one as possible!
Today's Murrayfield encounter (kick-off 3.00) -- for which over 25,000
tickets have already been sold with tickets available at the turnstyles
on the day and accompanied children admitted free -- will be Paterson's
last home game as manager.
Like the inspirational Hastings and coach Dougie Morgan, he demits
office after the World Cup. There is, then, a major incentive for the
top trio to bow out at home in some style.
There is a major incentive on offer, too, for at least a couple of
individuals in today's side. Tony Stanger, after 36 caps on the wing,
comes back into the international fold as a centre.
The Hawick man's single-minded determination to pursue an
international career in the midfield has paid off and yesterday he
declared that he was looking forward to today's match more than any
other.
Stanger, with 16 international tries to his name, including a hat
trick against Romania on only his second appearance in 1989, added: ''I
would much rather create a try than score one. I have been harping on
all season about getting the chance to show what I can do in the centre.
I have that chance now and it is all down to me as to whether I make it
or not.''
Stanger, who partners Graham Shiel in the absence of Gregor Townsend
and the still recuperating Ian Jardine, with Scott Hastings on the
bench, added: ''This has been a tremendous challenge. I've enjoyed this
season more than any other. What has gone before has drifted away and
I've kind of forgotten about it. I don't live in the past and once I had
made my decision to move position then the rest becomes history.''
The other Scot on parade today with a major point to prove is Kevin
McKenzie. The Stirling County hooker has played the role of understudy
to Kenny Milne for longer than he would care to remember and the
decision to give the combative McKenzie a run is a reward, of sorts, for
the loyalty that he has shown to the squad this season.
The Romanians have a strong pack with, perhaps, a weakness at
loose-head prop. The Scottish high command have studied a video
recording of the game and, no doubt, Peter Wright will want to pressure
Gherghe Leonte in the scrummage. Because of their height the Romanians
will fancy their chances in the lineout and in captain and No.8 Tiberia
Brinza they have an accomplished player who would ask difficult
questions of any side.
In Bucharest a fortnight ago, the Romanian stand-off, Neculai
Nichitean, emerged as a key player with a penchant for drop-goal
attempts.
Today represents, almost but not quite, the end of the Gavin Hastings
era. It is his Murrayfield farewell, but yesterday he declined to become
involved in the ''How will it feel?'' syndrome.
''I will be concentrating on the Scottish team performing at the level
that we have performed at during the Five Nations' Championship.
''Emotion comes out on the day and you can't say 24 hours beforehand
what you will be like. I'll tell you after the game,'' he declared, much
to the chagrin of the Fourth Estate which was looking for a suitably
lachrymose precursor to the Murrayfield adieu.

GLASGOW is bidding for a #13m multi-purpose sport and community
project in Easterhouse.
The Greater Easterhouse Initiative is about to reveal details of an
application to the Millenium Commission for National Lottery funds to
build a multi-use community building which is to be backed by various
agencies.
''We are in the process of making an application for a performance
base centre,'' confirmed GEI official Marian Keogh yesterday.
If successful, one likely function could be as the home of Scottish
weightlifting, the area's most successful sport, with a succession of
Scottish and UK champions from a club which began with one lifter on a
stairhead landing.
Last week the city's backing was confirmed by the formation of the
City of Glasgow squad, to be based at Bellahouston. Alex Richardson, the
Easterhouse club's founder, hopes the application could make Easterhouse
the national centre of excellence.
Easterhouse sports centre today hosts the British Masters
weightlifting championships, the first time the City of Glasgow squad
will have been in action. It includes two reigning world champions,
George Hilley (59 kilos) and John McNiven (64k).

STEPPING up for the cup . . . Walter Smith, the Rangers manager, was
keeping a firm grip on the Bell's premier division trophy yesterday.
Familiarity breeds content, was Smith's message. After a six-year
monopoly of the championship title, his team's seventh consecutive
league success has not dimmed the pleasure which he drew as he enjoyed a
preview of the silverware with which the Ibrox team will shortly be
presented.
The trophy on the ledge is the newly-minted third-division award,
which was about to be examined by Forfar Athletic's manager, Tommy
Campbell.
Smith and Campbell were in Glasgow for a photocall preview of the
trophies.

AIRDRIE manager Alex MacDonald has a double reason for wanting to see
St Mirren in deeper relegation waters when the clubs meet at Broadwood
this afternoon, and it is not that the man who has steered the
Lanarkshire side to their second Scottish Cup final in three years has
anything against Saints.
MacDonald and his men have not yet given up hope of promotion, either
by coming with a late run to win the championship or by fighting
themselves into second place, which would give them a play-off against
second bottom in the premier division.
At present they are sitting in fourth place, five points behind Dundee
and four adrift of Raith Rovers, with Dunfermline, whom they meet at
East End Park next Saturday, in third place.
To be realistic, Airdrie would have to win their remaining four
matches to reach their target -- and they will be ''up'' for the match
against Saints, who are equally desperate for points as they are just
four points ahead of second bottom club Ayr United.
The second reason is that, despite wayward thinking that teams tend to
relax in the matches leading up to a cup final, you can't just switch
your form on and off. Of course, it will be difficult for the Airdrie
players to totally shut out thoughts of meeting Celtic at Hampden on May
27, but MacDonald won't allow that to interfere with the bread and
butter business of picking up points.
''I have told all the players that we still have everything to play
for in the league,'' he said. ''They also know they are playing for
places in the cup squad.''
You can never speak to the man without a touch of humour coming
through. ''No premier division matches tomorrow?'' he asked. ''Maybe I
had better put aside a seat for Walter Smith, in case he wants to buy
anyone.''
Airdrie, however, have problems for today. Kenny Black begins a
four-match suspension, while Paul Jack, Sandy Stewart, Jimmy Sandison
and Jimmy Boyle are all doubtful.
St Mirren, too, have been hit by suspensions, with Jamie Fullarton,
Martin Baker and David Elliot all missing. Back in the squad are Steve
Watson, John Hewitt and John Boyd.
Saints face fellow strugglers Clydebank and Ayr United in their final
two matches, but assistant manager Campbell Money said: ''It's important
we take something from the next two, against Airdrie and Dundee.''
Dunfermline will be intent on keeping alive their promotion claims
when they meet Ayr at East End Park, and Ayr player-coach Sam McGivern
was yesterday feeling his own frustration now he knows he will be on the
sidelines for the rest of the season through injury.
McGivern said: ''To make matters worse, we have only 13 fit players
with 10 of our first-team squad unavailable. In fact, we are going back
out to the training ground in the hope of finding a centre half.''
Clydebank are looking for the three points and safety as they meet
Hamilton, but their coach, Brian Wright, will have to wait before
deciding his line-up because of problems with his strikers. Ken Eadie
has been ill this week, while both Steve Kerrigan and Craig Flannigan
are struggling with injuries.

CLACH will find themselves stumbling into someone else's party today
as they make the daunting journey to Huntly.
The champions are allowing all fans into the game for free in a move
which is sure to add to the carnival atmosphere as Huntly continue to
amass the points.
Clach midfielder Stuart MacKay could soon be performing in front of
bigger attendances, as he is being trailed by Sheffield United.
Elsewhere in a depleted card injury-hit Lossiemouth -- boosted by
manager Fraser Kellas's midweek decision not to join Elgin City -- are
likely to bring in two juniors as they head for Fort William.
Keith are out to continue their push for eventual second place with a
win at home to Brora Rangers, while Mark Murphy has recovered from
chicken pox for Cove Rangers as they host Rothes.

THE Scottish Athletic Federation, which voted against the re-election
of Commonwealth Games Council chairman David Webster, has also axed one
of their own. Long-serving Isobel Robertson, though already elected to
the Games executive, lost a SAF delegate vote this week. The three posts
went to Bob Greenoak, Barry Craighead, and Helen Spankie, one of whom
will now have to be nominated.
The following conveners were elected to chair SAF's eight
sub-committees -- Policy and resources, and development and marketing:
Peter Carton; finance, and performance management: Jim Scott; medical:
Joan Watt; officials: Tony Ireland; hardship and rules: Jim McInnnes;
coaching: Janet Leyland.

LAW experiments are to be tried out again by the Scottish Rugby Union
in matches at the Stirling County and Cartha Queen's Park grounds next
week.
The No.8 will be allowed to pick up the ball at the back of the scrum,
seven points will be scored for goals from penalties awarded against
foul play, offside, and killing the ball on the ground. In addition,
sanctions will be imposed against rolling off a maul, the lineout step
will be banned, and the facility to mark the ball will be extended to
anywhere on the field instead of just the defending team's twenty-two.

REBEL HEARTS: JOURNEYS WITHIN THE IRA'S SOUL
Kevin Toolis
Picador, #15.99
IN a short life before a violent death Paddy Flood built bombs, killed
soldiers, and sucked entire packets of boiled sweets. His body, dressed
in a blue boiler suit, was found on the Coach Road of South Armagh. His
hands and feet had been bound in brown masking tape, a plastic bag
covered his face, what remained of it. He was shot, with one
high-velocity bullet, as an IRA informer.
Paddy Flood confessed after eight weeks of interrogation by the Irish
Republican Army's counter-intelligence squad. He admitted telling his
handlers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary of Provo plans which
resulted in the capture of three arms dumps and five volunteers.
His confession was taped. The dead man's story unspooled. How as an
active member of the IRA he and his wife, Elizabeth, were arrested after
an explosives dump was found in a communal drying shed. The RUC
threatend to ''break Liz like a plate''. Paddy cracked, talked, then
walked back to the shadows as a traitor to the Derry community he loved.
It all ended on July 26, 1990, when an IRA man arrived on the doorstep
of Paddy's father, Seamus Flood. He said: ''Your son is not coming
back.''
It is a tribute to the enveloping skills of Kevin Toolis that you
wonder what sweets Paddy sucked. It is the thick layers of the ordinary
which support this potentially apologetic book about the extraordinary
circumstances of the IRA. Detail and description give frightening form
to those branded ''monsters'' by the British public.
The deeds of the IRA are monstrous. Enniskillen, Birmingham, Brighton,
make up your own list then add the British soldiers, RUC men and women,
shot on quiet streets. This is no defence, apology, or attack. It is
straight reportage mixed with the author's doubts, fears, and worries at
what he has done. The delight of being the first journalist to hear an
IRA informer's confession dissolves into rigid self-disgust.
He interviews a family after their son has been shot dead by the SAS,
then later asks the sister out on a date. Toolis refuses to take her to
see the spot where he died, realising he is simply a tourist among The
Troubles, wandering between the lines to report on the creation of the
''defenders'', ''brothers'', ''informers'', ''volunteers'',
''chieftains'', and ''martyrs''. He does not belong, he cannot fully
understand, and neither can we.
Toolis is a Republican who sees justness in the cause for a united
Ireland. But he cannot balance this with bombs in Warrington bins, or
neighbours who are killed in their kitchens. Those who can are
frightening. From the foot soldiers glad just to belong, to chieftains
who take both holy communion and human lives, to the mothers hugging
martyred sons; their capacity for pain, their resistance to reason, and
their zealotry are staggering.
Today the guns are silent and the politicians are talking. How long it
can last will depend on the tolerance of both Protestant and Catholic
communities. Redundancy from the active cells of the IRA will be a bad
blow for hundreds of men whose identity, eroded by unemployment, was
replaced by loyalty to the tricolour flag.
But it will be a blessing, if it can be achieved. If the thin men in
leather jackets, stone-washed jeans, and training shoes, the IRA's
unofficial uniform, can accept the war is over. And for what? A united
Ireland, still racked by poverty, unemployment, and guilt. And a long,
bloody and brutal legacy that will not be forgotten.
The book's cover is a disturbing reminder of this. Two black-haired
women carry a coffin, draped in the tricolour. It would be easy to
describe their eyes as dead, but instead they are determined, set on the
road ahead, past the cemetery and beyond. Their eyes will not be moved
by the fragile stillness of the Irish Agreement. It is frightening to
think what, in the future, would ignite them again.

The man who boosted sales of Guinness by
millions of pints would have preferred playing
Hamlet. However, as Douglas Thompson
discovers, pragmatism looms large in
the make-up of Dutch actor Rutger Hauer
GUINNESS was good for Rutger Hauer. It turned him into a
multimillionaire. For seven years he was the eccentric man in black, the
mysterious Dr Who-type figure, a big, bulging blond who, through the
popular television commercials, boosted sales of the stout by 37 million
pints a year. That's a lot of wallop.
Of course, Hauer would rather have been playing Hamlet. But this is a
most pragmatic man, an actor who has had ''the wheels turning'' for a
quarter of a century, a very large and restless chunk who has big hands
and, when he wants, a smile to match. He turned 51 in January, but says
he is still playing make-believe. ''Reality is something I can hardly
cope with. That's why acting is so great. I can be a little clown and do
not have too much responsibility.''
He was dubbed ''the Paul Newman of Holland'' when he first went to
Hollywood. But if you pause for a moment, as the country's only
international actor he was also tulip land's Warren Beatty, Jack
Nicholson, Robert Redford, Marlon Brando, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Until Hauer appeared, his country's best-known exports were bulbs and
beer. Oh, and Sylvia Kristel who made a career out of the Emmanuelle
films. Hauer has been more into violence than sex -- a lethal,
white-haired replicant in Ridley Scott's classic Blade Runner, the
goose-pimple killer in The Hitcher, and assorted Nazis and terrorists.
Now, he says: ''I am a millionaire and I don't need to work. I only
want to do interesting things. Hollywood does not really exist anyway.
It is a bunch of producers and distribution people who decide, along
with some agents, what material is going to go. If you happen to be in
it, then your face is nailed to one character all over the world and
they cannot see you in any other way. Perhaps, because I was European, I
was allowed to do many different things.
''The frustrations are there, but basically I mostly create my own
conflicts and I have to fight myself. I'm glad, though, that I'm not
known for just one film but a whole body of work.''
He has extended his CV this year, playing a mad monk in Nostradamus
and a Nazi detective in the American cable film Fatherland. They were
both projects he wanted rather than was ''persuaded'' to do. In the TV
mini-series adapted from Robert Harris' best-selling book -- what if
Germany had won the Second World War? -- he is, for a change, a hero.
Hitler is 75, JFK's father, Joseph, is the US President, and
''Germania'' is about to open diplomatic relations with America. It is
1964, and Hauer's SS detective, teamed with Miranda Richardson as an
American journalist, are caught in a tangle trying to expose the Final
Solution -- the systematic attempt at extermination of the Jews. ''It's
another take on Germans and Germany. Don't ask if you're being logical
about it, but it's thought-provoking. We wander around the thought of
what that would be like. What if we hadn't had 50 years of peace?''
Hauer -- he was author Anne Rice's first choice for the lead role in
the film adaptation of her Interview With A Vampire that finally,
through Tinseltown tactics and politics, went to Tom Cruise -- is
reflective and contemplative. It is as if nothing will disturb him. In
the 1970s he made Turkish Delight and Soldier of Orange with countryman
Paul Verhoeven, who is now a Hollywood director-in-demand following
RoboCop, Total Recall, and Basic Instinct.
There was a string of other films. But the Hollywood apple tempted
them. Europe seemed small. With Verhoeven he moved across the Atlantic:
''We were accused of disloyalty, but I don't accept that. It's like
children leaving home -- if you want to grow, you have to move on.''
Hauer moved fast. He ended up more sympathetic as the android than
Harrison Ford's human cop in Blade Runner, and even gave the horrific
killer John Ryder some charisma in The Hitcher. He got to be the good
guy in Sam Peckinpah's The Osterman Weekend but, truthfully, the movie
wasn't worth a wet Saturday afternoon. Far more successful has been his
American debut as a clever, relentlessly ruthless terrorist being hunted
down by Sylvester Stallone in Nighthawks.
It was not a simple job.
''I had a lot of problems, mainly with Stallone. I had to fight him on
the level of what I thought was good enough for the part and what he
thought was good enough. I was very angry. Very aggressive, very alert,
very awake. I don't think I've been more motivated or done better
work.''
That is, until Nostradamus. The film centres on Michel de Nostredame
(1504-1566), whose predictions have been studied by and mesmerised
billions of people for more than four centuries. The visionary predicted
everything from California earthquakes to the birth of Hitler.
Hauer has the showy role of a monk who may not have 52 cards in his
pack. ''I don't think he's crazy, but I never think weird characters are
crazy. I like the flavour of insanity and understanding guidance that
are both in the guy.''
The reaction to him is still ambivalent. He chain-smokes and commutes.
For every Gaulois, there seems to be flight from his potato farm in
Holland to his 52-foot sailboat, the Marius, which bobs in the waters of
Marina-Del-Rey, a few minutes' drive from Los Angeles Airport. He likes
the sea. He comes from a theatrical family, but ran away from home to
join the Dutch Navy. Then there was a spell in the Army. He didn't like
that and got himself discharged ''for psychological unfitness''.
He went to drama school in Amsterdam, had a spell in Basle as a
stagehand /heating engineer / actor, then returned to Holland to a
theatre company. ''Someone suggested I might be better off in the
movies. I walked away and basically created my own job.''
Hauer became a European star with the television adventure series
Floris that got Paul Verhoeven's attention and Hauer the lead role in
Turkish Delight in 1973. He played a randy sculptor and the raunchy
scenes -- on which Verhoeven would expand with Michael Douglas and
Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct -- were regarded as rather naughty then.
At the same time, Hauer was involved in a domestic drama. His first
wife had walked out of their brief marriage with his daughter Aysha. He
did not see Aysha until she was 17. He has been involved with the
acclaimed painter Ineke Stein for 26 years and, despite being unable to
have children, they have their own family trauma.
Aysha became involved with an Italian actor, but when their
relationship ended she left their six-year-old, Leonardo, who now lives
with foster parents in California. Hauer wants to adopt his grandson,
but the international courts have proved more of an obstacle than
judiciary forums. It is a subject he will not be drawn on. All you can
get is his promise of talking when he has the result he wants, which
may, in fact, be this month.
It's the only time Hauer returns to his quiet, detached, Guinness
image. It's a job he's thankful for. The brewery told his agent: ''We
are looking for someone who physically would resemble a pint of
Guinness; dark, cool, blonde, and enigmatic . . . and he fits the
bill.''
It has proved a presentable pension plan, but Hauer believes he has
more to do than sip espresso and puff cigarettes. However, after all the
years, this hybrid -- a man caught between Hollywood and Holland --
still seeks a niche.
''There seems to be a bigger need in Hollywood for people to
stereotype. They want to put you in a box. It makes for short-term
security, I guess, but the problem is that people don't come in boxes.
We're more like bubbles of water.
''They always want to put me in bad-guy boxes, but playing villains
comes easy to me. I find that people are fascinated by evil. They're
totally paralysed by it and, as an actor, I'm not. I think in my darker
characters I go a little further than most American actors. I don't know
why. Maybe it's because I'm not afraid of that side of myself. If I can
get to play a monster on the inside, I like it a lot. Because a lot of
us are monsters on the inside. We just pretend we behave and then
suddenly a fuse goes and we go nuts. Well, some of us do.
''I still feel my roots are in Holland and I still feel very much part
of that culture. But travelling so much changes you. It's lonely. I'm
alone most of the time, but that's just the way it is. I can't say I'm
happy about it, but it's part of what I do.''
Hollywood does not really
exist. It is a bunch of
producers and distribution
people who decide, along
with some agents, whatmaterial is going to go

On a plantation down
south, the intrepid
Andrew Murray
encounters tales of
bothies, blisters, and
the ubiquitous midge
I scratched the
night away after
having plodded
25 arduous miles
to beddy-byes
WITHIN the walls of a simple bothy on the fringe of a midge-infested
plantation in the hills that shoulder Sanquhar, aspiring literati have
been bitten by the Southern Upland Muse. Two weeks before my overnight
stay in Polskeoch bothy, a Dutch couple had consigned the following
lines to the but-and-ben visitors' book: ''It is a pity so that the
midgets (sic) bite so much in here the wood.''
Having just tramped through Glen Trool, I, too, wondered if the
midges, Scotland's hovering bugbears, had irked Robert the Bruce when he
defeated an English force there more than 600 years before my sojourn.
You can, of course, avoid the midges by planning your walk for spring or
early summer. But insect life is not the only drawback to tramping it
along Scotland's coast-to-coast, long-distance footpath, the Southern
Upland Way. Many walkers would rather bag a few Munros than labour,
blinkered, through blanket Sitka spruce and along farm tracks. The
former Countryside Commission for Scotland routed the trail as the
easiest and cheapest way through Britain's most afforested region,
instead of liaising doggedly with landowners to traverse what bare
hillsides are left in the south.
On its tortuous course from Portpatrick to Cockburnspath, it threads
its way through the glorious Galloway hills almost entirely on forestry
roads, and through the romantic Ettrick Valley in the Borders via a
public road. Forty per cent of the trail is on road; 25% through
open-plan softwood factories.
Much of the Southern Upland Way goes through bogland, although rangers
have battled hard to alleviate this. Blisters are a bothy talking-point,
thanks to the jarring effect of the rough tracks, but Thorlo socks help
out here.
I would not recommend doing the Way, as I did, in one 12-day-trek.
Better by far to do the western, and more difficult, half -- preferably
in April or May when the midges are dormant -- and the eastern stretch
the following year.
The Way, albeit outwith the Highlands, is no cakewalk. It is, rather,
a Krypton Factor staged across several river valleys and not through
them; although a hotelier swore blind that a hardy Swiss spinster had
walked the way carrying two carrier-bags filled with newspapers, which
she used to insulate her body against the elements at night. Another,
80-year-old walker with artificial hips, bagged the whole way every
year, she averred.
Properly lubricated hip joints are surely a ''must'' across the
dolorous hag-land between New Luce and Bargrennan. The map contains
daunting features such as Purgatory Burn: the terrain is so stark that
lepers used to be dispatched there to die.
Below Liberland, nestling in a rare forest gap, stands Derry Farm,
chez Alec McKnight, who (a light year away from the nearest pub)
wassails guests of an evening. Alec relaxes from his daytime job as
shepherd by playing a Hammond organ.
The route through Glen Trool should have followed the northern and
more scenic side of the loch: one has to hop over boulders on the
southern side, with a very occasional glimpse of the loch's beauty. Do
not under any circumstances pay #4 for a night in the filthy Scout-hut
at Mid Garrary, or you will learn by your mistake (unless it has
undergone a terrific facelift since I scratched away a night there after
having plodded 25 arduous miles to beddy-byes).
Breaking the stretch from Dalry to Sanquhar is the bothy patronised by
the aforementioned Dutch folk and by another guy who (the visitors' book
alleges) spotted a luminous figure dressed in white flitting across the
fir trees. The ''poachers fae Sanquhar'' had also recorded their stay.
Before you reach the bothy you have to climb the relentless Benbrack,
but at least you have the reward of as fine a view as you can get south
of the Highlands. When you eventually reach Sanquhar, you will be able
to send a letter to friends from the world's oldest post office -- and
tell them that a mere eight miles away you will be strolling through
Scotland's highest village, Wanlockhead.
St Mary's Loch, a splendid sight, signals the Borders region. Between
it and the Loch of the Lowes is Tibbie Shiel's Inn, the favourite
watering-hole of Sir Walter Scott and the poet James Hogg, the ''Ettrick
Shepherd''. Twelve miles further, Traquair, the oldest inhabited house
in Scotland, has its own brewery. The mansion is a thousand years old
and 27 kings and queens have stayed there. Its gates have remained
closed since Charles Edward Stuart stayed there, and they will remain
closed until a Stuart ascends the throne again.
Other highlights to come include Melrose Abbey, famous as the burial
place of Robert the Bruce's heart. At Longformacus there is the Standing
Stone of Braidshawrig commemorating the 12th Earl of Lauderdale, who was
struck by lightning there while shooting grouse. Cockburnspath is an
anti-climax, since the Way steers away from the welcoming sandstone
headlands of the North Sea and meanders under a scruffy underpass at the
busy A1.
The Southern Upland Way will take its toll if you underestimate it.
What a pity that the powers-that-be could not re-route it out of trees
that never shed their leaves and over what is left of the wildernesses
of southern Scotland.
The 90-odd-mile West Highland Way is altogether more popular and
user-friendly. I had earmarked it as a walkover after shanking 212 miles
from coast to coast. It's a tough little devil, though. But compensation
for the more demanding danders, such as the one along Lomondside that
would tax a mountain goat, comes from the comradeship you are bound to
experience between Glasgow and Fort William.
We met only one fellow walker, a detective from Glasgow, during our
trek across the waist of Scotland -- and he was out for a day walk. In
contrast, the West Highland Way is thick with walkers and, therefore,
badly eroded in places.
Whether it was the prospect of our reaching 40 next year or the latent
puerility in us, my companion, ''Desperate'' Dan, and I seemed destined
every night to encounter Davie, a yoghurt-maker from East Kilbride
(''there's a job with culture!'' I ventured) with whom we culled brain
cells in any pub that would have us. Davie epitomises the West Highland
Way walker. Not for him salopettes or skin-tight Lycra trews: he did it
all in jeans and a Rangers jersey.
A sentimental journey for a week from the outskirts of Scotland's
largest city to the foot of Britain's highest mountain attracts many
thousands of people every year. There were German versions of joker
Davie, and a Belgian now settled in Glasgow laughed his head off when he
discovered that workmates had put up wanted posters for him the week
before his jaunt. Anyone who spotted Walter was urged to deflate him and
send him in a matchbox to Fort William.
The West Highland Way takes in some outstanding scenery, notably along
the east bank of Loch Lomond and around Kingshouse. The West Highland
railway line, surely one of Europe's most scenic, offers several escape
routes.
Before Balmaha, take a trip up Conic Hill (or ''Chronic Hill'', as a
Govan meter-reader told me). From the summit you can marvel at the
Highland Boundary Fault, which runs from Stonehaven to Ireland via
Dumbarton and Arran, and separates Highland from Lowland Scotland. Along
the fault lies the string of charming islands that beautifies Loch
Lomond.
The novelist Tobias Smollett wrote: ''I have seen the Lago di Garda;
Albano, De Vico; Bolsena and Geneva and, upon my honour, I prefer Loch
Lomond to them all, a preference which is certainly owing to the verdant
islands that seem to float on its surface, affording the most enchanting
objects of repose to the excursive view.''

The Andalucian town of Ronda echoes
to the sound of famous names:
Hemingway, Welles, Steinbeck. It
also boasts Spain's first bullring.
The setting of For Whom the Bell Tolls. The
town Madonna could not use for
a video set.Deirdre Chapman
drinks in the cool, heady
atmosphere and vows to eschew
bustling tourist beaches in future
THE Serrania de Ronda rises like a balcony behind the Andalucian
coastal plain. On the summit we shall sit in a row fanning ourselves,
being slightly bored by the coastline of Africa. These dripping agaves
leaning out of drenched rockfaces as we ascend through a mountain mist
are just a blip, for everyone knows that the whole Spanish landscape
dictionary, from arroyo to zona de estacionamiento, comes with
languorous Steinbeckian assurances of aridity.
Spanish is the language of desert and cactus. The Spanish Conquest of
only the warm parts of America was a clever stylistic coup, seducing a
whole generation of chilly Anglophone writers, Steinbeck, Chandler,
Hemingway et al, who in turn so successfully re-exported Spanish style
that it is now impossible to approach the original sierras without
bringing California and Texas and Mexico along too.
Up there on the ridge above us, the little town of Ronda has so much
heavy cool leaning on to it that ought to be a flattened heap. Spain's
first bullring. The ashes of Orson Welles. The setting of For Whom the
Bell Tolls. The town that said no to Madonna when she asked to shoot a
video there. Not just the site of the film of Carmen, but the reputed
home of the gipsy who inspired Merimee's novel that inspired Bizet's
opera.
The mist lifts. Slab walls of Islamic fortifications loom up ahead,
and for a disorienting moment we might be on the other, eastern edge of
Muslim expansion, among the palace-strewn escarpments of Rajasthan,
until Christian belltowers and pagan bodegas crowd in, along with
awesome glimpses of the famous gorge, the Tajo. One hundred and seventy
metres at its deepest, it slices through the town like a wobbly knife
through cheesecake, dividing the ancient city from the
eighteenth-century Mercadillo. In Ronda you are never more than a few
blocks away from somewhere you might dispatch, or be dispatched by, an
enemy.
Presently we process across the Puente Nueva, the spectacular bridge
that from below resembles the glass-less perpendicular nave wall of a
cathedral spanning the gorge, and make our entrance into the Plaza de
Espana, where sits Spain's newest Parador, the ultra-formal former town
hall, right on the lip of the deepest part of the Tajo. We have come
directly from Malaga, a glorious city of ornate perpendicular facades
and stately boulevards crowned by the Moorish alcazaba, and the force is
still with us, the force that makes non-Spaniards straighten their backs
and rethink their casual wear.
Ever since the airport, full of stripe-haired British second-home
owners wearing their sunglasses like tiaras, with ponchos and
high-heeled boots, we have seen only Spaniards and Spanishness. It is
contagious. I sidestep the Parador porter in a sort of disordered paso
doble and lug my baggage to my room rather than break the flow.
My balcony overlooks the small terraced garden and pool, then,
spectacularly, the abyss. It is cloudy and cool, and when I go out into
the square there are lots of men standing around in the mountain air.
The tourists I expected to be out and about, wrecking the ambience, are
nowhere to be seen. Most, it turns out, come on day trips from the
coast.
The town reminds me powerfully of Gjirokaster, the showpiece southern
mountain town of Albania, the same cool currents drifting down from high
places and quick-eyed citizens stirring into a brisk version of the
somnolent evening paseo of the plains. The Virgen de la Paz leading out
of the Plaza de Espana to the Reina Victoria where Hemingway and Rilke
stayed is lined and scented with orange trees bearing both the showy
blossom and the ripe fruit among dark glossy leaves.
I stop to buy a guidebook, which begins: ''I, sir, am from Ronda,
queen and lady of the Serrania, protected by her mountains and summits
just like a spoilt child by God's will.'' Neither the mistranslations
nor the author's creative anguish -- ''I find that I have missed several
voids and lacunae which troubled me deeply'' -- detract from his immense
assurance and pride.
It is all-pervasive, this pride. It comes from empire and exploration
and building cathedrals and trouncing the Moor, an event so fresh in
Spanish sensibilities that only recently have tour guides began to point
out those Moorish arches not quite obscured by the walls of the
Christian re-conquest. Tonight, the opera is in town. The concert hall
is packed for La Boda de Figaro whose action, after all, takes place
just up the road in Seville, and they stand to cheer the Cherubino, the
one Spanish member of the international cast.
In the morning, the first rain for months is falling. The golden sand
of the empty bull-ring, the oldest and most respected in Spain, has an
out-of-season beachy look that sees off the ghosts, but the tight ritual
seating, so like a Roman arena, is impressively claustrophobic.
It was an order of knights, the Maestranza of Ronda, who laid down the
original rules for horseback bullfights, and another rondeno, Pedro
Romero, who invented the on-foot fight using the muleta after his
grandfather leapt into the ring and used his hat to distract a bull that
had unseated an aristocrat. The first corrida was held here in 1785 and
the arena's museum has, among the ''suits of lights'', Manolete and
Ordonez posters, Hemingway and Welles snaps, a photograph of Juan Carlos
sitting in the royal box -- its first use -- on the two hundredth
anniversary.
This is my first visit to Southern Spain, but in this museum with its
utterly alien reverence for beaded jackets and bloodstained white
ruffled shirts, I'm having deja vus like hiccups. Stuffed bulls' heads?
The moth-eaten Aberdeen Angus in Mr Black the Butcher's shop. Bullfight
posters? In the late fifties, every male student bedsit in Britain had
one. In summer, the trendy half of Fleet Street decamped to the
bull-running in Pamplona while the serious fringe sat with Olivetti and
Anglepoise, writing its Hemingway novel. Everyone remembers the Che
Guevara poster that replaced the Matador, but the Matador is the more
revealing role model, only incidentally touched with idealistic Civil
War associations.
These, of course, are rampant in Ronda. Many fighters against fascism
disappeared into the Tajo. But it's salutary to be reminded that before
the sixties -- before satire, feminism, and animal rights -- every
fanciful post-adolescent northern male wanted to be Spanish. Spain
itself is currently experiencing a revival of the whole seductive
package, the young are heavily into Flamenco, bulls are buoyant, and a
celebratory corrida for the Infanta Elena's March wedding in Seville was
only de-scheduled out of regard for international sensibilities.
You could spend hours walking round Ronda. When you leave the
Mercadillo, and recross the bridge into the Ciudad, the old Moorish
town, every winding lane is worth pursuing. The massive cathedral church
of Santa Maria Mayor, originally the Friday mosque, has its vast
interior lit and warmed by gold in excess and an extravagant chandelier,
while its entrance is flanked by an almshouse and an enclosed order of
nuns.
The Mondragon Palace, the most splendid civil building in the town,
was the residence of the Moorish ruler when this was the capital of a
kingdom, and after the Moors were defeated in the late fifteenth century
the Catholic King Ferdinand stayed here for a time. It is exquisite, a
series of small enclosed courtyards and colonnades each in a different
style using painted glazed tiles, terracotta, marble or wood, opening on
to a miniature tropical garden with a fountain overlooking the gorge.
Everything points to the town's influence. Roman Ronda was once the only
place outside Rome licensed to mint coinage and, more recently, the
Savings Bank of Ronda was second in importance in Spain.
The ultimate test of a southern town is how it stands up to a rainy
day. Ronda gets both ears and the tail. It is not languid or
over-charming or dependent on whitewash. The golden sandstone of the
Moorish and the public buildings such as the newly converted Parador
alters elegantly from hot sunlight through cool cloud to mountain dusk.
In the Parador's formal lounge in the evening, one of Andalucia's best
self-taught Flamenco guitarists plays for us, sitting by the window.
Mist rolls across the square at his back. No smoky low-beamed bar could
better set off the music than this grand setting. Grandeur, formality,
and arrogance are the essence of Spanish style, and when guests cast off
leggings and T-shirts and dress up for dinner, ghosts and waiters
silently applaud.
Next day we drink coffee in the wonderful Posada Real, an early
sixteenth-century building in the town's oldest street, the Calle Real,
newly opened as an inn. Its bedrooms retain the bay window seat, the
''cierro'', where single girls once sat to be chastely admired by their
suitors, the dining-room is redolent of ancient smoke, while the patio
at the rear has a tiny swimming pool and sauna. The most prized culinary
delicacy of the region is Jamon de Bellota, cured dried ham from
acorn-fed black mountain pigs which you can buy in the Casa del Jamon,
the costliest selling at 7000 pesetas (#35) a kilo.
Ronda is the heart of great walking country through former bandit
territory, spangled in spring with periwinkle, jasmine, almond blossom,
lavender, and orchids, between cork plantations and peasant holdings
full of tall broadbeans. The Cueva de la Pileta with its paleothic
animal paintings is nearby, close to the village of Benaojan. The ruins
of Ronda la Vieja, Roman Acinipo, are 12 km away.
The town is also a staging point on the chain of Pueblos Blancos, the
stunning red-tiled, white-walled Moorish villages perched on pinnacles
that descend in an arc towards the coast. Benalaujria, tiny, steep,
famous for its chestnuts, has an ethnic museum, an impressive cobbled
square, and, in the Meson la Molienda, an inn converted from an olive
mill with letting rooms and a tiny coral and blue painted dining
terrace. We ate lunch in glorious March sunshine on the terrace of La
Bodeguita de En Medio overlooking the square of Casares, only 18 km
inland from Estepona, with a Moorish fortress towering above us on the
peak, kites and a griffon vulture circling.
Miraculously, the city of Malaga is not on the expat beat. You can
take a horse-drawn carriage around its formal streets, finishing at the
immense baroque cathedral, and continuing on foot through little
pedestrian passages and squares, the Pasaje de Chinitas where Lorca
wrote a poem to his favourite bar, now reproduced on a plaque on the
wall, Picasso's birthplace, and the Antigua Casa de Guardia that serves
sherry from the cask accompanied by shellfish.
I thought I'd missed the bus to truly Spanish Spain, and I'm glad I
finally caught the plane. Let them singe on the coast. Singe with them,
even. But go inland, especially out of season, and you'll find that
immaculate upkeep is the only price historic Moorish Spain has had to
pay for its tourism. I loved, and had my eyes opened by, Malaga almost
as much as I loved and had my eyes opened by Ronda, town of Jose Paez
Carrascosa, master of metaphysical guidebook writing, who concludes:
''May this little volume accomplished with much love and suffering help
you to know that God is lavish and also remote.''

SCOTS, it seems, are not backward at coming forward for information
about science and technology. During the Science by Fax event run by
Glasgow University, the service was swamped by inquiries. So much so
that the same-hour reply target rapidly slipped to a same-day
turnaround.
A seven-year-old youngster asked, via a handwritten fax, the question
that all those who haven't managed to get beyond the first chapter of
Stephen Hawking's Brief History of Time are still trying to get to their
brains around: ''Please tell me what started the Big Bang.'' The
question is so complex that it fell to Professor John C Brown, the
Astronomer Royal for Scotland, to provide the answer.
''This is a good and very big question -- it is hard to answer
completely, but I hope the following points help.
''If you mean 'why' did the Big Bang start, science cannot answer;
science describes 'how' not 'why'. The simplest 'why' answer is 'God
made it', but that raises the question, 'Who made God?'.
''As to 'how' the Big Bang started, it started as an incredibly small
and fantastically hot concentration of the whole mass of the universe in
the form of pure energy, something like light. This happened around
10,000 million years ago. This point exploded outwards, cooling down
until eventually the energy, or most of it, turned into matter -- a bit
like water droplets condensing out of steam from a boiling kettle -- as
it hits the air, it cools.
''This matter then collapsed under its own gravity to form galaxies,
stars, then planets, and even people.''
The Astronomer Royal signed off by saying: ''Keep asking good
questions like that and you'll make a good scientist. Best wishes.''
Alexander, the little boy who asked the question, must have been
absolutely gobsmacked to receive a reply from such a scientific
luminary.
Such was the success of the Science by Fax service that the university
is planning to run it year-round. Graham Durant, deputy director of the
Hunterian Museum, said: ''We're hoping to set up a permanent Scottish
Science by Fax line for individuals and schools. Every day, teachers,
primary teachers in particular, are being asked questions by young,
enthusiastic children who want to know all about the universe and what's
going on in it and many teachers, I'm sure, are not in a position to
answer all these questions.''
It will take a few months to get the new service up and running, but
in the meantime Graham Durant is keeping his fax line open on 0141 330
4206 and he promises to do his very best to answer any questions by the
start of the autumn term.
In addition to the service being offered by Glasgow University,
Weekender has established similar links with other Scottish
universities. If you have a science or technology question, write to
Futureworld Questions, The Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow, and we
will pass it to the relevant academic.

PLANTS have been stealing the world's headlines over the past few
weeks with the news that the pods and seeds of the Australian Morton Bay
Chestnut contain a substance found to be successful in the fight against
the HIV virus.
The Institute of Physics is on the track of ''talking plants'' with
the discovery of a new substance that is believed to act as a growth
regulator and may also act as a plant signalling system, the theory
being that plants are possibly communicating with each other via the
release of tiny quantities of gases or vapours.
Closer to home, the University of Glasgow reported a major
breakthrough in understanding how plants capture and store light via
photosynthesis, the fundamental source of energy for all living systems
on earth. These blueprints from nature will provide valuable information
that, in time, will have much wider implications across many sectors of
science and medicine.

racing cars too are fitted with a black box.
Most racing companies buy off-the-shelf hardware and software, but
Jackie Stewart and his team at Paul Stewart Racing have developed their
own software package that can look at cornering times, identify time
losses and gains, check the throttle, brakes, and aerodynamics, and
monitor the performance of steering, wheels, speed, and revs.
The idea was the brainchild of Jackie Stewart and since installing the
new software the company's Formula 3 team has won three successive
championships and is leading contenders in a fourth.
The racing company is taking the system -- developed with
computer-science students from Glasgow Caledonian University -- even
further to include external factors such as weather conditions. The new
technology has been so successful that Paul Stewart Racing is
considering selling the system commercially. Already there have been
talks with with a number of car manufacturers.

Couch potatoes need not budge, just a quick channel hop by remote
control and they could have their every shopping need catered for --
from footwear and food to holidays and high fashion. After seeing a new
scheme in motion in Italy, Yvonne Wightman believes that some day all
shopping might be done this way
The shape of things to come: in the future, dedicated followers of
fashion need go no further than their TV screens in search of the latest
styles.
AT the European Oracle User Group conference in Italy last month, 1500
software boffins from all over the world were given an update on the
latest information concerning the BT interactive TV initiative, a
project that promises to create a revolution in home viewing and
shopping.
Oracle is a $2bn company based in Redwood Shores, California, and it
is providing the multimedia database and navigational software for the
new service, which was first trialled last March on 60 BT employees in
Ipswich.
''That technical trial proved the effectiveness of BT Interactive TV
technology and we are now able to market trial a service that offers
consumers unprecedented convenience, choice, and control,'' said Rupert
Gavin, director of BT's Information Communication and Entertainment
(ICE) Programme.
The next stage of the project will take place this summer, when 2500
trial households in Colchester and Ipswich will be able to access 600
hours of television programming, 400 hours of movies, 200 hours of
music, plus that all-important home-shopping -- all transmitted down the
telephone line and on to the TV via a set-top box supplied by Apple
Computers.
These householders will be able to choose a range of items from a menu
on their ordinary TV set. Shopping-on-Demand services will include
holidays from Thomas Cook, fashion and sporting goods from Sears
(Olympus, Adams, and Freemans), books, CDs and videos from W H Smith.
There's even a grocery service which is being developed by Safeway.
TV and Movies-on-Demand will be provided by a consortium of BBC,
Carlton, Kingfisher, and Pearson with input from the major Hollywood
studios. Sports programming will be supplied by BSkyB and music will
come from Polygram, Sony, and Warner.
The interactive ''station'' will also carry educational programming
for children and adults. NatWest is to offer a home banking service and
IPC magazines will be offering video, audio, text, and graphics on, for
example, TV listings, features on personalities and extracts from
lifestyle magazines.
The training and enterprise companies will be in on the act with
community link services covering job centres and local authorities, as
well as information from social and charitable groups, clubs, and
societies.
Once the results of this second trial have been evaluated, BT hopes to
be able to establish which services the consumer wants to use, which are
commercially viable, and generally sort out the nuggets from the dross.
A number of other UK and European groups have expressed an interest in
becoming involved in future applications and these include Air Miles,
Dixons, Great Universal Stores, and Bank of Scotland.
In time, audio-on-demand, news-on-demand, and information-on-demand
will be added to the service.
Although it will be some time before the service goes ''live''
throughout the UK -- about three to five years -- there is no doubt that
we are well on the way to the days when we can conduct our lives from
the comfort of our armchair.

Although apprehensive
about her night out,
Margaret Hughes was
more than pleasantly
surprised by the outcome
Number Thirty Three
Perth
BASING any decision on first impressions is not always a good way to
go about your business. Over the years I have swooned over luxurious
furnishings and crisp white tablecloths, only to discover that the
reason these are so wonderful is because the restaurant in question has
had to compensate in some way for the poor quality of the food.
My first impressions of Number Thirty Three, a seafood restaurant in
Perth, were not good. On reserving the table by phone I found the manner
of the person taking the booking brusque and unfriendly. Even before I
got into the car to drive to Perth, I was not looking forward to the
evening.
When I arrived, I was shown to a table in the Oyster Bar, where light
meals and pre-dinner drinks are served. The predominant theme is art
deco. A Rennie Mackintosh chair sits stylishly at the top of a flight of
stairs. It looks fragile and forbidding. Pink walls, grey trimmings, and
lots of mirrors continue the theme.
A variety of enormous shells confirms that the restaurant is indeed a
fish and seafood one. The music is strictly Busby Berkeley and Ziegfield
Follies. Having been raised on these classic movies, I enjoyed the
ambience. However, I still could not shake the feeling that I was not
having a good time.
Things improved with a look at the menus. Choices are from two
separate menus. Starters and desserts come from the light menu, main
courses from the restaurant one. I struggled to choose between the
gravadlax, which at #7.50 was the most expensive starter, and the smoked
trout and apple mousse, at a more affordable #4.50. I went for the
gravadlax, looking forward to a mountainous portion of smoked salmon
richly flavoured with dill.
When the plate arrived I was stunned at the paucity of the portion. I
felt quite cheated -- until I tasted it. It was very good. The added
accompaniment of dill mayonnaise was also full of flavour. In spite of
myself, I was beginning to have a good time.
My companion had chosen the alternative starter. The mousse was
smooth, not at all gelatinous. The flavour of the trout was wonderfully
smoky, but it was the sharpness of the apple that really gave this dish
its star quality. It was accompanied by a fresh salad of lettuce,
peppers, celery, and cucumber, topped with a mustard vinaigrette. Not a
big portion, but very filling. Indeed, my companion was unable to finish
it.
On to the main courses. The choices included salmon, sea bass, and
scallops. I chose the bass and seafood selection, served steamed in a
parcel. As the waitress arrived with the meal, I looked forward to a
ceremonial ripping open of the package, with the promise of a huge treat
inside. She cut it open with less ceremony than I would have liked, but
as the fragrance of the food rose, the aroma was terrifically
appetising.
The bass was a huge fillet of meaty white fish, accompanied by mussels
and prawns. The flavour of the steamed fish was very good, as were the
mussels, which ranged from very small to quite large. The prawns,
unshelled, tasted a little undercooked and had a chewy texture. My
companion chose salmon served with an avocado salsa. The fillet of
salmon was quite small, but beautifully cooked, although the salsa was
very mild.
Vegetables are served on a side plate and were an interesting
combination of mashed turnip, thinly sliced parsnip, broccoli,
cauliflower, and a small baked potato. It was a good mix; a little
unusual, and so much better than a predictable collection of boiled
vegetables. By this stage I was having to admit that my earlier
reservations about the restaurant were proving wrong.
Dessert included that old faithful, sticky toffee pudding. I have
never eaten this before, so decided to give it a try. This is one of the
traditional puddings so fashionable at the moment. It is also one which
is made in many different ways, individual cooks and chefs adding their
own touches to put their stamp on it. I was excited at the prospect of
Number Thirty Three's version.
I am much more used to seeing the dish served as a small pudding,
studded in dates and nuts and covered in sticky toffee topping. This
version was a slice of cake smothered in piping-hot toffee sauce; no
sign of nuts or dates. The cake was richly spiced, almost like a
gingerbread, and I did manage to find a date, but no nuts. The sauce
was, if anything, too hot, but deliciously sweet. Hugely enjoyable, and
a memorable first sticky toffee pudding.
Number Thirty Three boasts of its ''personally chosen'' wine-list,
comprising whites predominantly but with a good selection of reds and
sparkling wines. I chose Coopers Creek Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.
A dry, fruity wine with a rich bouquet and ripe flavours of berries, it
was a good choice.
Service in the restaurant was friendly and brisk, but not rushed. When
booking, I was told the table was available at either seven o'clock or
nine. I chose the earlier time, but certainly did not feel the staff
were anxious to hurry us along as the clock ticked perilously close to
nine o'clock on a busy Saturday evening.
Many of those also dining appeared to be regulars, being met with
cheery welcomes, questions about families, and jokes about their
habitual visits. People like to eat in restaurants where the staff know
their names, so it is easy to see why these customers return.
Prices are competitive, except for the gravadlax, and there is
adequate choice on the menu. However, I suspect that if I frequented
Number Thirty Three regularly, I would want more variety. I had not
expected the night to be an enjoyable experience, but it was. I enjoyed
it immensely. It just shows how wrong you can be.
* Number Thirty Three, 33 George Street, Perth. Tel 01783 633771. The
restaurant is open Tuesday to Saturday for lunch from 12.30 until 2.30
and for dinner from 6.30 until 9.30. It is closed all day Sunday and
Monday. Three courses plus wine in the evening, in the restaurant, cost
around #30. Light meals and lunch, served in the Oyster Bar, start from
#4.50.
RECOMMENDED
Moshi Moshi, 7 Buccleuch Street, Glasgow. Telephone 0141 353 0777.
* THE owner is on a mission to bring Japanese food to the citizens of
Glasgow, and to prove to them that it means much more than sushi and
saki. Appetisers include rolled sushi filled with smoked salmon,
avocado, and cucumber, or there is yakatori, which is grilled skewers of
chicken dipped in a teriyaki sauce.
Main courses are served in a ''bento box'' -- a traditional Japanese
lunch box with separate compartments that house rice, appetisers, salad,
pickles, and dressings, as well as the main course of your choice.
Choose from Gyuniku Yasai-Maki Bento, which is carrots and green beans
wrapped in beef and grilled, or a Zen Bento of vegetable tempura.
There is also a selection of Japanese beers; for an authentic treat
try plum wine and soda.

Beware Greeks and their attitude if you
are attempting to gain compensation
for an accident, warns lawyer
Costas Andrea, who has first-hand
knowledge of the pitfalls
EACH summer, many visitors to Greece, the destination for thousands of
British holidaymakers, will suffer horrific injuries in accidents caused
through no fault of their own. To add insult to injury, they will soon
discover that there is no-one to turn to for compensation.
Mainland Greece and its islands have never been so popular with
British tourists. Part of the charm is the laid-back lives of the Greeks
themselves, but it is this very attitude that makes the job of a lawyer
trying to obtain compensation for accident victims both frustrating and
demoralising. At best, the attitude is a hindrance, at worst, an
immovable obstacle; it appears to penetrate not only the police and
local authorities, but also the judiciary.
Seeking the co-operation of Greeks is a task in itself, but when it
comes to suing one of them it is case of hit one, and they all cry.
Allegations of bribery, corruption, and collusion abound. I am convinced
some Greeks supplement their income by part-time work as professional
witnesses.
A typical example was the case of a watersports centre owner in Crete,
who was not covered by insurance and therefore stood to be sued
personally. His employees had incorrectly fitted a harness to a British
paraglider, who was then left with a semi-paralysed arm, making it
impossible for him to continue with his driving job when he returned
home. Faced with this, the Greek threatened to produce as many
''witnesses'' as he needed to state that the harness was fitted
correctly.
As with any litigation, evidence is vital. In Greece, the police
report is the most important factor: without it, any claim to civil
damages is bound to fail. Knowing this, the attitude of Greeks in not
wanting to have the police involved takes on serious and sinister
repercussions, as a young woman discovered after the tips of her fingers
were sliced off. She was attempting to climb back on to a boat after an
organised swim; the hinged metal ladder acted like a giant guillotine.
It took two hours to get her to shore for emergency treatment, and the
last thing on her mind was worrying if the police would investigate.
They did not, and as nobody had informed them, I had the job of telling
this unfortunate victim that without a police report a civil claim
against the boat owner was too weak to sustain.
Here in Britain, if I gathered my evidence and collated my documents
to support a claim for damages, it would be reasonable to expect the
third party's insurer to make a reasonable offer. Not so in Greece. With
the exception of some British insurers who underwrite a small amount of
business in Greece, the Greek insurers just do not want to know. This is
hardly their fault, as there is no incentive whatsoever for them to
negotiate settlements.
They can hold on to their money longer by letting the claims run all
the way to trial. For, although Greek courts can order a losing party to
pay costs, such costs as are awarded are nominal and do not reflect the
real cost of the litigation. To compound the misery, the actual awards
for pain and suffering made by Greek courts are pathetic. Injuries that
would attract tens of thousands of pounds in Britain will only fetch
hundreds in Greece.
I can offer no reason for this. With Greece in the European Union, the
value of the lives of all Europe's inhabitants must surely be on a par.
I can offer no excuse why there should be such debate in Brussels on
standardising the size of European sausages when there is such
disharmony in the level of awards for pain and suffering.
On one of the rare occasions I was able to negotiate a settlement
directly with an insurer in Greece, the amount I obtained for my client,
while excellent by Greek standards, was miserable by ours. Luckily, I
was dealing with a British insurer, otherwise I doubt any settlement
would have been forthcoming. My client was a young man mowed down by a
Greek driver. His severe head injury resulted in post-traumatic amnesia
for five days and left him with information-processing problems,
difficulties with balance, and decreased dexterity. He recovered only
#3000.
It is commonly believed that the travel insurance we take out when
booking our holiday would cover such eventualities. This is also a
misconception. If you are injured on an activity not excluded under the
policy, all your medical expenses should be paid for. It will also pay
for you to be repatriated by air ambulance if necessary.
When it comes to compensation, however, most travel-insurance policies
will pay out only in the event of death or permanent disability. This
last category is further narrowed by stipulating that it must result in
you being unable to undertake any form of work.
Perhaps the most important part of holiday insurance, as far as
compensation is concerned, is the section providing you with legal
expenses cover. This will pay all legal fees to pursue an action for
damages. Unfortunately, it is not so straightforward. If you are injured
in Greece by a Greek national, proceedings will have to be brought over
there. I have already highlighted the problems this brings. As a
consequence, I regularly have to tell legal expenses insurers and their
insured that it is not reasonable to proceed with litigation in Greece.
There are, however, some important points to help maximise your
chances of obtaining compensation:
* Insist that the police are called and they prepare a full report,
taking statements from those involved and any witnesses. It is vitally
important that the report specifies what injuries have been suffered.
* Enlist the help of your holiday representative and British Consulate
to ensure the police are thorough and that your statement, and those of
any witnesses, is correctly translated.
* Try to obtain a copy of the police report, or, at the very least, a
note of the names and addresses of any witnesses, especially if they are
independent and even more so if they are Greek.
* Collect evidence. Take photographs, not only of any vehicles or
faulty equipment involved, but also of your injuries. Keep any piece of
paper relating to the incident, especially receipts and invoices.
* Keep a diary. Note down your injuries, symptoms, and treatment, in
particular the name of the doctor.
* Complete and forward your travel-insurance claim form as soon as you
return.

The Herald's team of
reviewers offers an
informed tour around
the latest sounds in
rock, classical, and jazz
City of Strangers, Ute Lemper (Decca)
* BE warned. There is nothing cosy or consoling in Ute Lemper's new
album, a walk on the dark side of the spirit through the songs of
Stephen Sondheim and Jaques Prevert. These are songs for those who have
sinned and been sinned against. Anyone who saw Lemper's show at last
year's Edinburgh Festival will recognise the highly intimate,
theatrical, close-miked presentation. Desperate, bitter, lonely songs
for when you're feeling not blue, but black.
Mussorgsky: Pictures at an Exhibition (Mercury)
* DOUBLE helping of Mussorgsky's garish classic. First recorded in
1961 and never before released -- an amazing, power-driven version of
the original for piano by Byron Janis, the sensational American pianist
whose career was dogged by ill health. Playing of huge strength and
clarity. Then, the orchestral version with Antal Dorati and the
Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. The 1962 recording sounds a bit boxed
in, but a performance of breathtaking integrity.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
Tales, Marcus Miller (Dreyfus)
* MILLER treats himself to springy hip hop and funk backdrops of the
sort he provided on Miles Davis's Tutu, putting his eloquent
thumb-busting bass guitar where Miles's trumpet might have been. The
tales are by turns ghostly, bearing the voices of Charlie Parker and a
distinguished jazz cast; darkly humorous; unashamedly romantic; and
poppy. Miles would have revelled in them, but saxophonists Joshua Redman
and Kenny Garrett, trumpeter Michael Stewart, and Miller deputise with
distinction.
Nordic Quartet, John Surman/Karin Krog/Terje Rypdal/Vigleik Storaas
(ECM)
* LESS a quartet than a pool of four players working in sundry
permutations. The endlessly creative Surman, whose Nordic credentials
are as an Oslo-based Devonian, features most often, duetting on bass
clarinet with Rypdal's portentous guitar or laying carefully weighted
baritone sax lines against Krog's dry, Annette Peacock-like singing or
Storaas's sparse piano commentaries. The result is refined and evocative
chamber jazz, best served during the more meditative hours.
ROB ADAMS
Universal, The Painted Word (My Thing)
* ''BROUGHT to you in 1995 by '77'' it says in small print on the CD
booklet, which rather sums up the problem with the debut UK album by The
Painted Word, some eight years after the group was first feted by U2.
Alan McCusker Thompson -- who is The Painted Word -- has been making
this record (in Glasgow) for a long time and things have moved on during
the process. We do ''atmospheric'' rather differently these days, or at
least they do in Bristol. On disc, these songs all sound like you've
heard them before, but try the live experience when the bands appear at
the Mayfest club at the Old Fruitmarket on the eighteenth.
Yes, Morphine (Rykodisc)
* A GARAGE band without guitars? Boston's Morphine are an unlikely
concept, but this trio of bass, drums, and saxes are the first new
recipe in rock 'n' roll since Suicide. Dana Colley does the Roland Kirk
thing, playing two saxes at once -- notably on the single Super Sex,
which is a four-minute movie. Elsewhere, bassist, vocalist, and
songwriter Mark Sandman has perfected the truth that less is more.
KEITH BRUCE
Eight Over The 8 Ball, various (eightball)
* TWELVE slices of functional New York garage handily collected in
spacey alternate-mix form on two CDs. Thumbs aloft to Joi Cardwell's
Trouble; The Difference and Dream Drums by Lectroluv, plus the African
Dream's All the Same Family.
Classic Eighties Groove 2, various (Mastercuts)
* IT is 1981, and your world is filled with burbling bass-lines,
chirping guitars, metronomic handclaps, and floaty stabs of synth. You
wear a spangled headband and tuck your trousers into your ankle-length
purple go-go bootees. You look ridiculous, of course, but you look the
way you wanna. Your soundtrack? Let's Groove by Earth, Wind and Fire; I
Wonder If I Take You Home by Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, and Stomp by the
Brothers Johnson. Buy this disc and it will favour you with magic
oofle-dust: it will make you younger and more foolish than you actually
were in 1981.
DAVID BELCHER
Dear Mr Cole, John Pizzarelli (BMG).
* OH dear. If ever there was a case of reality not matching the hype,
this is it. Pizzarelli is meant to be the latest crooning sensation, but
this CD -- a tribute to Nat King Cole -- proves otherwise. What he is,
however, is a superb guitarist. Along with Benny Green (piano) and
Christian McBride (bass), he shows what this 18 track-CD might have been
on first-rate instrumental numbers such as This Way Out.
Double Rainbow, Joe Henderson (Verv)
* THIS celebration of the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim was under way
before his death in December. The CD is divided into two suites: the
five tunes played with a Brazilian band win my vote; then seven tracks
which have been given the jazz treatment. Of these, the
classical-sounding Happy Madness (just pianist Herbie Hancock and
Henderson) and the evocative Portrait in Black and White stand out.

ONE of the many things that -- according to the movies, anyway -- are
ordered better in the United States is that poignant, adolescent
milestone, the Last Day At School. While us bleak Brits moon around the
playground puffing a furtively defiant ciggie, at best raising enough
joie de vivre to lob a desultory water bomb or wrap the headmaster's car
in loo roll, the Yanks like to make a point of having some fun.
They go out and drive around all night in search of new boyfriends and
girlfriends (American Graffiti and about 100 others); they hold
skinny-dipping swimming-pool parties and go to watch the last showing of
Red River at the closing-down local cinema (The Last Picture Show);
sometimes they even burn the school down (those cuddly nogoodniks The
Ramones in Rock 'n' Roll High School).
Now if this excellent school of cinema has a fault, it tends to be
that its style of humour errs on the side of coarseness: some of them
make Dumb And Dumber look like the latest from Merchant-Ivory. But those
among you who have seen Austin, Texas, Richard Linklater's
semi-documentary ramble through the mores of America's
laid-back-to-horizontal Slacker subculture, will know how unlikely it is
that anyone in his last-day-of-school drama -- if that's not too
energetic a word -- Dazed And Confused (rental, cert 18) could whip up
the vim and voive required for anything so uncool as vulgarity. Well,
not much, anyway.
It may be only 1976, and slacker only means some guy who doesn't turn
up for football practice, but Linklater's louchely lovable teens are
surely slackers before their time, a bunch of Beavises and Buttheads
with extra added brains. The timescale and technique may be familiar --
a day and a night in the life of a dozen or so sub-plots, all concerning
pleasure-loving kids with too many hormones for their own good -- but
Linklater gives his characters a depth and subtlety unusual in this kind
of film, avoiding easy sentimentality and cheap laughs. There are plenty
of laughs, but of a surprisingly wry and downbeat kind.
A non-star cast led by Wiley Wiggins and Milla Jovanovich do the
script plenty of justice; in the words of Elvis Costello, they're
teddybear tender and tragically hip. Dazed and confused? You will be.
But you'll like it.
THAT Flesh And Bone (rental, cert 15) died like a dog at the cinema is
no great surprise: it's a sombre and sordid Texas tragedy in which
nothing spectacular happens, its plot is slender to the point of
anorexia, and it takes almost two hours to tell its tale. Yet on video,
where our expectations are different, Fabulous Baker Boys director Steve
Kloves's floperoo plays very nicely indeed.
Dennis Quaid stars as a moody young drifter in a nothing job,
tormented by the memory of a nasty incident 30 years earlier in which he
was unwittingly an accessory to his psychopathic father James Caan's
murder of the family that had taken him in -- all the family bar a baby
girl. Things seem to be looking up as he falls in love with smalltown
mystery girl Meg Ryan, but then his no-good Paw turns up and Ryan turns
out to be . . . guess who?
Like we said, the plot goes nowhere much, but Kloves lays on plenty of
doom-laden atmosphere and the three leading performances are terrific,
especially James Caan's. Our redneck kinsman Couch Hominy Grits says its
just another pinko Yankee attempt to blacken the good name of the South,
but then he would say that. Well worth taking a chance on, Couch Potato
says.

George and Barbara Crooks explain to Beverley Brown how it was love at
first sight when they found their perfect penthouse
WHERE price is not the only deciding factor in choosing a home, most
people opt for a style of property that suits their lifestyle. Outdoor
enthusiasts may prefer a garden; those who don't want the hassle of a
garden will choose a flat. But occasionally you find a home that sets
out to confuse all predetermined expectations.
Barbara and George Crooks live in a flat that thinks it's a house,
though it's only minutes away from Glasgow's city centre at the top of a
Victorian building where you would expect to find a flat. The Crookses
certainly did when they first saw it five years ago.
But once inside you find this flat has stairs leading from the
reception hall up to the main apartments . . . and a few more stairs
leading to french windows off the dining room, out on to a totally
secluded roof garden complete with patio and barbecue.
''It was so unexpected that it was definitely a case of love at first
sight,'' says Barbara, a doctor in a Glasgow hospital. It was the first
house that she and chartered accountant George viewed shortly before
they married.
''The details described it as having a 'cathedral bedroom and nautical
lounge' but it has so many unique features that we couldn't believe our
luck when the owners said they would accept our offer.
''Even after five years, it's still like living in a house instead of
a flat. And standing out on the roof garden at night is spectacular. You
could be anywhere in the world.''
The first striking aspect is the size of this home; Barbara and George
have a vast collection of books so they have turned the entrance hall
into a small library, wide bookcases concealing understairs storage that
comfortably swallows up the patio set in winter, plus the barbecue and
George's golf clubs. The entire house is carpeted in silver grey, with
simple white walls that reflect the light from a combination of
deep-recessed traditional windows, skylights, and sloping roof windows.
In the wall that separates the top hall from the through lounge/dining
room is an opalescent, square, stained-glass window in the style of
Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The small guest bedroom has arched windows
set between sloping walls and the master bedroom has a vast cathedral
ceiling with adjoining dressing room and an enormous en suite bathroom
with bath and separate shower cabinet. In a modern home this is the size
of room you would expect to be a lounge; two large velux windows flood
the bathroom with light above ''his and hers'' basins set in a pine
vanity unit. There is an additional large toilet with shower as well.
The almost octagonal lounge does have a nautical air, thanks to two
floor-to-ceiling sloping walls that lead into the dining room and on
into the galley style kitchen.
But the most stunning is the roof garden. ''In the summer we use the
barbecue and eat out on the roof,'' said Barbara. ''And because it is so
private it's perfect for sunbathing -- although I've learnt to keep an
eye out for Captain George's helicopter,'' she laughed. ''I'm sure our
neighbours wondered when they saw the patio set being delivered. Perhaps
they thought it was our dining room furniture.''
Much as Barbara and George love their unique flat cum house, they have
accepted that their time is limited. ''If, or when, we decide to have
children then sadly we will have to move because it is not a home for a
young family,'' Barbara added. But the patio set and barbecue are
already out on the roof for one more summer at least.

LIZ TAYLOR remembers a friend, and a world outside time
DO you believe a house can mourn? That it can show loneliness and
sorrow as clearly as a bereft and weeping lover? I know it can.
In November an old friend died suddenly. She was found lying in the
kitchen of the house she had lived in for more than 40 years, a house
that was her creation because it was only a four-roomed cottage when she
bought it but she replanned it, built on an extension, and transformed
it into a house that would not have been out of place in a Jane Austen
novel.
Around it she created a garden that was her most dominant passion, a
garden in which she knew every plant as if it were a friend. When
special ones flowered she would go to her neighbours and say ''You must
come and see my gentians!'', or whatever had caught her eye, as if she
were introducing them to dear friends.
The garden seemed to creep into the house because the rooms were full
of vases of flowers and pots of plants throughout the year. To make it
easier for the outside and indoor worlds to merge, she never locked her
doors unless she was away from home. What a friendly feeling it was to
know that you only had to turn the door handle to be admitted into her
private world.
It was a world outside time. Nothing had changed since the early
1950s. A log fire always burned in the hearth on cold days; the
furniture was good but slightly battered, the curtains threadbare in
parts, the chairs deep and comforting and covered with flowered
cretonne.
There was always a dog, her Border terrier, slumbering in front of the
fire or sunning itself on the doorstep in good weather. It was a very
calm, happy dog who took life contentedly and without hysteria, like its
mistress.
Some of my most pleasant memories are of winter evenings when I sat
with my friend in her sitting room doing crossword puzzles and listening
to music, for she had a wonderful collection of operas sung by the most
famous artists, on LP records. She was horrified by my ignorance of good
music and set about educating me for she had been at finishing school in
Florence just after the First World War and seemed to have spent her
entire time in the opera house.
But time did not stand still even in that enchanted house and though I
did not allow myself to recognise it, my friend grew old and weary
during the last couple of years. The beloved Jacob sheep -- who were
given names like Daffodil and Twinkle -- that grazed in her orchard were
given away; a fox got her three geese; then her old dog died. It was as
if the loose ends of her life were being tidied up.
When she herself died I felt as if I had lost a parent. It was acutely
painful going back to her house when her various legacies were being
removed but at last that was all over and one spring day recently I
thought I would go back for the last time.
It was a fine day. Her garden was coming to life with spring flowers.
There were clumps of brilliant yellow daffodils beneath the orchard
trees; the miniature irises and anemone blanda she loved so much were
blooming in the rockery. I could hear her voice saying, ''Come and look
at them. Aren't they lovely?''
But there was something wrong with the house itself. I looked in the
window at the empty sitting room and realised that it had shrunk, as if
it had bent over and shrivelled like an old person who diminishes with
age. That room which had seemed so spacious, when we sat there listening
to music, suddenly looked tiny.
How had she fitted in so much furniture, so many pictures? I could see
the marks on the walls where the pictures had hung so I knew that they
were not figments of my imagination. I stared at the empty floor and
bare walls and refurnished them in my mind but it was impossible to
recover the old serenity.
At the other side of the house the feeling of desolation was even
stronger. Two hanging baskets full of dead plants hung at the kitchen
window and a bundle of artificial flowers showed dimly beneath the
greenish water in the old stone sink at the back door.
The house was crying out in loneliness. It missed her. Somehow the
emerging glory of her garden made the all-pervading sadness more
obvious.
Before I drove away I told the house that soon someone would buy it
and bring life back to its lonely, silent, yearning rooms. I hope
someone as happy as my friend will live there, play music, warm
themselves before the fire. I hope some other dog will sun itself on the
front doorstep.

SECOND, THIRD DIVISIONS
AFTER a bout of misbehaviour in the past week, it is almost a question
of who won't be playing this afternoon. No fewer than nine red cards
have been issued in the two divisions since last Saturday.
However, while others contemplate the wages of sin, there are no such
problems at Stenhousemuir, where the home side take on second-division
leaders Dumbarton. The Sons are at home next week against Queen of the
South, who today travel to second-top Morton, and it is hard to see
anything other than a win serving the Warriors' purpose.
Queens are not yet totally safe from relegation, although Meadowbank
remain eight points adrift with a maximum of 12 available between now
and May 13. Jim Leishman's team must win at Methil, where East Fife will
be without Dougie Hope and David Beaton, both sent off last week.
Clyde visit doomed Brechin, while Berwick are hosts to Stirling Albion
in a contest which will end the losers' interest.
The third-division title was neatly tied up last week by Forfar, hosts
today to naughty Cowdenbeath -- the Fifers had Mark Yardley and Eddie
Petrie sent off last week. After a second successive home defeat inside
a week, Ross County are now fourth and a win away to Albion Rovers is a
must.
The games are running out for Alloa, who must keep the points at home
to Queen's Park, whose David Graham is banned after a midweek red card.
Montrose are disputing second place after their win at Dingwall -- where
Derek Grant sat out his automatic ban -- and now travel to Caley
Thistle, while main rivals East Stirlingshire are hosts to Arbroath.
Peter Dwyer is back after suspension for 'Shire.

THE OXFORD BOOK OF AUSTRALIAN SHORT STORIES
Michael Wilding, ed
Oxford University Press, #17.99
INTELLECTUALS have had great fun with the philistine image of
Australia. Barry Humphries, for one, created three characters to mock
the shocking culture attributed to Australians: Barry MacKenzie, as
coarse as they come; Sir Les Patterson, as crude as they come; Dame Edna
Everage, as crass as they come -- witness her memorable observation that
''Lady Macbeth was, when all is said and done, just an ordinary Scottish
housewife trying to cope with her husband's mid-life crisis''.
Australia has produced fine poets, such as A D Hope and Judith Wright,
and fine artists, such as Sidney Nolan and Arthur Boyd, yet still the
country is popularly perceived as a land low on high culture. Michael
Wilding's anthology looks at the lie of this land and tries to tell the
truth through Australian fiction.
Wilding includes one of his own stories, ''Somewhere New'', and has a
character ask and answer a question about Australian culture: ''Can you
imagine a Kingsley Amis in Australia? Or a Brigid Brophy? It just isn't
possible. The beaches are the centre of life here . . . No-one agonises
about culture or class or religion here, they get on with living with
their bodies.''
The creative writers here assembled tell a different story.
Patrick White, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1973, is
represented by a story dedicated to Barry Humphries and first conceived
as an idea for a film featuring the great comic. ''Clay'' is an eerie
account of a young man despairing of the ritual of writing which prompts
one character to quip: ''Honest, Clay, it must be a great satisfaction
to write, if only to keep one of your hands occupied.'' A good gag but
White keeps the mind seriously occupied as he tells his demanding tale
of one worrying about words.
Christina Stead, in ''A Harmless Affair'', explores the emotions of a
poetry-loving woman who longs to have a celebrated writer as a lover:
''She regretted that she had not known Paul's love, that would have
been, she was sure, the revelation of love: and she bitterly regretted
not having in her body a child of this dear and intimate man . . .''
Stead is nothing if not sensitive in her portrait of an individual
emerging from a poor background and stepping awkwardly into a
class-conscious society.
David Malouf writes as a man who finds mystical meaning in language:
''I come to these shores from far off, out of curiosity, a mere tourist,
but in my own land I too am the keeper of something: of the great book
of words of my tongue . . . All this is mystery.'' So, despite the
comments of Wilding's character in ''Somewhere New'', Australians do
agonise about culture and class and religion. Australian writing has
more to offer than bums on beaches.
A distinctively Australian mode of storytelling began with Henry
Lawson at the end of the last century. Writes Wilding: ''It was
certainly Lawson who established the enduring model of a laconic
minimalism of language taut with irony and repressed emotion . . . His
writing not only expresses the feel of Australia, it also contains an
argument.'' The argument advanced in Lawson's ''The Union Buries Its
Dead'' suggests only death is democratic in a society divided by cash
and class.
Like Lawson, Barbara Baynton -- an outback governess who eventually
married into the English aristocracy -- pitied the Australian poor and
richly deserved the reputation she established with such stories as
''Squeaker's Mate''. Ethel Turner's ''The Child of the Children'', first
published in 1897, follows in the footsteps of a slum girl, Flip
Huggins, as do-gooders do their worst to transform her into a lady going
by the name of Eliza Brown. Wilding wonders if the names Huggins and
Eliza inspired Shaw to invent Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle in
Pygmalion but that is beside the point of the facts of life behind
Turner's poignant fiction.
Women played a prominent part in the evolution of Australian
storytelling as it moved from social realism to modernist mannerisms. We
are still in the class-conscious land of Lawson in Marjorie Barnard's
''Dry Spell'' but the style has shifted from protest to prophecy as the
author breaks with the past and takes on ''the burden of remaking our
world''.
Henry Handel Richardson (the writing name of Ethel Richardson)
likewise looks forward to the future in her ''Conversation in a
Pantry'': ''Oh, don't you wish we could see into the future, Trix? And
what it's going to bring us?'' Australia had a reputation as a man's
world but women were out to change that world with their remarkable
artistic efforts.
Oodgeroo Noonuccal, who died in 1993, was the first Aboriginal writer
to publish a book and she makes a welcome appearance in this book with
an amusingly tender tale about a carpet snake and its companions: ''My
father belonged to the Noo-muccle tribe of Stradbroke Island, and the
carpet snake was his totem . . . My mother belonged to a different
tribe. The carpet snake was not her totem. She hated old Carpie, because
of his thieving ways.'' Noonuccal reminds us that Australia is a country
with more than one culture.
And Wilding reminds us of the impressive range of Australian culture.
He has chosen wisely and one story cleverly sums up the image he wants
to project of a place once caricatured as a community of convicts. ''The
Inside Story'', by Janette Turner Hospital, has a writer taking on a
class of convicts. A cynic asks her: ''Why do you do it? You think you
can reform them with culture?'' Yes you can. You can learn that lesson
from the short story of Australia.

MARABOU STORK NIGHTMARES
Irvine Welsh
Cape Original #9.99
OVER a weekend in Kintyre I persisted with the new Irvine Welsh novel,
despite the repetitive f-word, the rape, child abuse, football violence,
racism, homophobia, suicide, incest -- the list is heralded in the
publicity hand-out. I persisted because I believe there is now a serious
generation gap in Scottish literature, and Welsh has been hailed as
''the most gifted of the younger writers working in Britain today''.
The new novel begins with Roy Strang lying comatose in a Scottish
hospital bed, going deeper deeper under the administration of drugs to
recall several layers of his existence, beginning with his childhood in
a housing scheme in Granton, Edinburgh.
Welsh gives his character the patois that colours much of modern
urban-based Scottish fiction, most notably Kelman's work. Strang says:
''Thank fuck for a childhood in a large Scottish housing scheme; a
wonderful apprenticeship for the boredom that this kind of semi-life
entails. Pull the fuckin plug.''
Presumably it is no accident that Strang is immobile, helpless, in
modern Scotland, kept docile by drugs, his disturbed mind moving into a
fantasy world terrorised by the Marabou Stork, ''a scavenger/predator
bird who stands for everything wrong in the world, from football
violence to capitalism and male abuse of power,'' the publicity hand-out
summarises.
Is this, as has been claimed, an important new voice, defining the
addictions and depressions of the ''chemical generation'' caused by the
Thatcher and post-Thatcher decades? What would Edwin Muir have made of
this novel? I raise this question because it will take a critic of
Muir's bravery and insight to ignore the plaudits from the south
(''Mind-bendingly good'' . . . ''a thrilling ride'') and to evaluate
Scottish fiction's preoccupations with urban themes and basic linguistic
usage. Muir would not have put his hands to his face in despair at the
f-words and the bitterness and violence in Welsh and his contemporaries.
He would have recognised  the historical continuity.
The works of Welsh, Kelman and others do not represent a dramatic
departure from the Scottish literary tradition. They are the new
Calvinists. Marabou Stork Nightmares is being described as a ''trip to
hell and back''. The language Welsh uses may be blasphemous to many, but
it is biblical in the pitch of its anger. Through his narrator he
watches society with horrified fascination, calling down damnation on
those who are responsible for city housing schemes where unfulfilled
lives are kept in check by easily obtained drugs and where violence
itself becomes a narcotic.
There seems to be no escape: the Strangs emigrate to South Africa, but
are forced to come home.
It is as bleak and frightening a message as the one shouted by the old
Calvinists from their pulpits, the difference being that for Welsh hell
is here on earth. The unsatisfying aspect of such polemical fiction --
just like Calvinist philosophy -- is that its grimness gives human
happiness and potential no scope to develop. Everything seems
preordained, from birth in the housing scheme to the final fatal needle.
Such fiction debases the very patois it is trying to preserve.
I could not finish the new Welsh, as I had not been able to finish The
Acid House. Instead I went for a walk in Kintyre, to the raucous
rookery, and suddenly I realised that what is missing in Welsh and his
contemporaries is the flyting voice of old Scotland, harsh but
ultimately healthy and progressive.

WHILE premier division enthusiasts, if that is the right word, have
had to dwell on the fascinating contest to see who will fail to stay in
the top league this season, a host of first division clubs have been
engaged in a race for the championship which has been at least as
intriguing.
It is getting near decision time for all of the teams involved,
particularly the two who meet at Dens Park today, Dundee and Raith
Rovers.
After 32 hard-fought games, these two are separated by a single point
and victory for either would be an immense lift towards the title with
only three games to face afterwards.
In Dundee's case, a win would just about seal their promotion along
with the championship, unless they stumble badly in the home straight,
but Raith have shown on a number of occasions this season that when the
inducement is big enough they are inclined to find top form.
Their preference for a big stage was best illustrated by the defeat of
Celtic in the Coca-Cola Cup final, but they also made it to the semis of
the Tennents Scottish Cup, and their manager, Jimmy Nicholl, believes
the presence of a decent crowd and the knowledge that the prize is there
to be won will again inspire his side.
''If we hadn't had so many draws early in the season,'' he said, ''we
might have been well in front by now, but we haven't played as
consistently as we know we can. I think it had a lot to do with the
feeling the players had when they were relegated last year.
''Every game in the top league had them worked up, adrenalin flowing,
but they couldn't seem to get going with the small crowds they had to
accept in the early weeks in this league. I am sure they will react to
the occasion at Dens.''
He has team problems, even if he prefers to skirt past them quickly.
Both Shaun Dennis, his key central defender, and Ally Graham, his
experienced striker, are suspended. Apart from anything else, that will
greatly reduce Rovers' effectiveness at set-pieces, as both are
dangerous in the air.
''I have said all along that I didn't need to buy players, so if I was
right the squad should be capabale of coping.''
Nicholl acknowledges that a win for Dundee would put them close to
uncatchable -- ''We would need to win our last games and they would need
to lose theirs'' -- but insists there would still be a play-off place up
for grabs. However, he is not inclined to dwell on that prospect. ''If
we want to be champions we simply have to beat Dundee.''
The Dens manager, Jim Duffy, who will be without suspended pair Gerry
Britton and Dusan Vrto, as well as injured Kevin Bain, is adamant
today's confrontation is no league decider. ''With Dunfermline and
Airdrie only five points behind, it can't be.''
He would surely fancy his team's chances, quietly, nevertheless, if
they gathered another three points this afternoon. Either way, it could
be the most significant day of the season for the first division
challengers.

Comedian, writer, and television presenter Donna McPhail talks to ANN
DONALD
IREAD in spurts. I like to read in bed a lot but when I'm busy I'm
just too knackered. What I do is read about five books at a time in a
mad junkie craze then I don't read anything for about six months. When I
get home from doing stand-up at about 2am, I go to bed and read until
the sun comes up.
The last thing I read was Wild Swans by Jung Chang. If I'd known it
was going to be about the Cultural Revolution in China I wouldn't have
touched it with a bargepole. It was written from the point of view of a
girl who told the story of three generations of Chinese women. It sort
of tricked me into reading it because at first there seemed to be a
story but it also told you the whole social history of China and what a
sinister character Chairman Mao was. It was absolutely fascinating.
Complicity by Iain Banks was another fantastic book that I loved very
much. It's the story of a journalist in Scotland who is covering stories
about these people -- Conservative MPs and the like -- who start dying
all over the place in very macabre, sexual ways. Then it turns out that
it's his best friend that's doing it. Some of Banks' stuff is frankly
above my head but this has a normal readable story and the imagery isn't
too intellectual.
I'm totally passionate about books. I don't read them in the same way
that I watch telly and turn over if it doesn't interest me. It interests
and annoys me that a bad book made it into print but I'll still read it
all the way through. I love books. I love stationery to start with and
anything to do with paper that's bound. I generally buy about five books
at a time -- half because I like the sound of them and half because
other people have said they are good. Then I make myself read all five
of them before I go and buy any more.
I think that I'm quite anally retentive about my books. Also, I don't
like lending them. If I do then I put my name all over them and if
they're not back in a week then I start phoning people up. I take
absolute pride in my books. I have to break the spines evenly in my own
special way and no-one else can do it or I get very cross. I'm actually
quite sick but everybody has their little foibles about their books. I
sound quite sad, don't I?

As it's time once again to head for the great outdoors, HEATHER ROSE
considers the latest barbecue equipment
EVEN in Scotland barbecuing has become the way to entertain in
summertime -- despite the whims of our climate. Sales of barbecues have
been increasing rapidly since the mid 1980s with retailers noticing a
marked rise, especially when holiday weekends are on the horizon.
But for those venturing into the BBQ scene for the first time, the
array of equipment can be perplexing.
According to the giant B&amp;Q organisation, charcoal barbecues are the
best sellers with versions ranging from one at #9.99 designed for
picnics, camping, as well as garden cooking. On the other hand, you
could splash out around #80 for a trolley style charcoal barbecue grill
and smoker made of heavy duty steel.
If you want to make life really simple you can have a built-in
barbecue, so avoiding problems about storing or wheeling them into
position. Argos, for example, has versions costing from around #20 and
these units can be literally built into a brick or stone housing in your
garden.
They can be bought with high-sided fireboxes so that hot charcoal will
not spill, plus lid covers for protection when the grill is not being
used.
While charcoal barbecues are popular, gas styles are gaining an
increased following. Costing anything from #75 to #500 or more, their
speed and convenience is boosting their popularity, particularly with
regular barbecuers.
Admittedly, some purists see gas versions as cheating but these models
have the advantage of warming up quickly and being easy to control.
However, if you only occasionally enjoy a barbecue at a picnic, the
beach, or fishing, then a disposable barbecue could match your needs.
Twin-pack instant barbecues are available from as little as #5.99 with
a two-pack party size at #9.99.
Of course it is important to remember that disposable barbecues must
be disposed of safely -- doused with water and, if possible, taken home.
In line with the growing popularity of al fresco eating has come a
mass of outdoor cookery equipment, like Lakeland's BBQ bits and bites
holder at #7.95, a chrome-plated basket that lets you cook cubes of
meat, poultry, fish, and vegetables together without having to thread
them on to skewers.
The range also includes a BBQ grill basket at #7.65, which enables
burgers, sausages and fish to be cooked without any danger of them
slipping into the grill.
As the weather becomes warmer and evenings lighter, no doubt the
coming months will see even more people switch on to barbecue fun.
But we have still a long way to go before we catch up with our
American and Australian cousins. Barbecue ownership in this country is
currently around the 20% level. Across the pond more than 82% of
American households own a barbecue.
This grill basket (#7.65) is useful for cooking smaller items that
would fall through the grill. The Balfour kettle barbecue (#49.99) and
(right) the Lanark (#74.99) from B&amp;Q's gourmet range. Disposable
barbecues start at #5.99 a pair
Lakeland's bits and bites holder (#7.95) does away with the messiness
of shish kebab skewers.

THERE is a marvellously indefinable term that's bandied about these
days to cunning effect: ''collectable.'' This started out by referring
to things that were sub-antique, but nevertheless had their own appeal
through good craftsmanship or good design. And -- big plus -- they
weren't ludicrously overpriced.
Maybe we're talking here about Bakelite ashtrays with cigarette burns,
and brass fishing reels whose original owners discarded them because
they frightened the trout. Never mind. We could be persuaded to collect
them, and we did. Inevitably there was a chain reaction.
First, Bakelite ashtrays with cigarette burns and brass fishing reels
that don't work any more became objects of desire. As a result, they
became harder to find. As another result, the prices rose until they
were no cheaper than antiques. So in practical terms, they became
antiques.
The process then moved on one step. The next generation of
''collectables'' were things like Second World War ration books and
early NHS kidney bowls. They weren't particularly pretty, but they had a
kind of nostalgia-cred. Can you find one today in your price range?
Absolutely impossible.
Enter the entrepreneur with the next step. Now we have people who make
things with the deliberate intention of labelling them ''collectable''.
In this category I include limited edition wall-plates showing a famous,
unheard-of artist's impression of the Yalta conference, a series of
thimbles depicting ''Five Centuries of the Scottish Turnip'', and other
series of mint-quality pewter medallions covering ''Great Provosts of
the Disappeared Burghs''.
Frequently, the dealers in these artefacts also offer a rack made from
renewable non-rainforest timber in which the artwork can be displayed
together in a group to good effect in your home, to provide an endless
focus for debates at dinner parties etc. As Disneyland Professor of Bad
Taste at the University of Camelon, though, I urge you to resist such
blandishments. Keep this stuff in a drawer, out of sight. Here are the
basic rules . . .
* If you collect, don't tell. I have a friend who loved ceramic frogs,
and has never been able to explain why. He's not even a Francophobe.
Every time a pal wants to give him a present the pal thinks ''frog''. As
a result my friend has every flat surface in the house permanently
covered with ceramic frogs. He can't move any of them into retirement in
case the donor drops by and finds his frog is missing. As a result, my
friend is now perpetually frogbound, and hates the things.
* Do not admire anyone's collection carelessly. In this case, my
informant discovered that an acquaintance had been gathering models of
Gothic wizards holding crystal spheres etc. These horrible figures were
moulded in plastic made to look like metal, or the other way round. It's
hard to be sure. My informant lied: ''Wow!'' Guess what she got for
Christmas?

GRAEME Smith, who has opted out of the Scottish system this season,
produced a marvellous performance in the 1500 metres free-style at the
British trials in Sheffield yesterday to clinch his place in the team
for the European championships in Vienna in August.
Ignoring the threat from 1991 European junior champion Paul Palmer and
former European senior silver medallist Ian Wilson, the teenager won by
more than 13 seconds in 15-18.35.
But it a disappointing day for Fraser Walker and Alison Sheppard, and
their third places in the 200m medley and 50m free-style respectively is
likely to leave Smith, as he was at last year's world championships, the
sole Scot in the British team in Vienna.
Sheppard raised hopes of a third successive European appearance when
she claimed pole position in the heats, but a marginal improvement to
26.71 left her having to settle for third best behind Susan Rolph in the
final. Results:
Men: 100m free-style: 1, N Shackell (Millfield) 50.91; 2, A Rapley
(City of Sheffield) 51.08; 3, M Carl (Redbridge Boro) 51.18. 200m
medley: 1, D Warren (City of Leeds) 2-05.25; 2, J Hickman (Stockport
Metro) 2-05.32; 3, F Walker (City of Glasgow) 2-06.29; 6, P Latimer
(Stockport Metro) 2-08.44. 1500m free-style: 1, G Smith (Stockport
Metro) 15-18.35; 2, P Palmer (City of Lincoln) 15-31.46; 3, I Wilson
(City of Leeds) 15-32.80.
Women: 200m butterfly: 1, H Slatter (Warrington Warriors) 2-16.21; 2,
A Bennett (Nova Centurion) 2-17.22; 3, M Peddier (Portsmouth Northsea)
2-19.60. 200m back-stroke: 1, K Osher (Ealing) 2-14.98; 2, J Deakins
(City of Coventry) 2-15.62; 3, E Tattam (Portsmouth Northsea) 2-18.14;
6, N Steel (Aberdeen) 2-21.99. 50m free-style: 1, S Rolph (City of
Newcastle) 26.21; 2, K Pickering (Ipswich) 26.46; 3, A Sheppard (City of
Glasgow) 26.71; 5, K Hope (City of Dundee) 27.21. 800m free-style: 1, S
Hardcastle (Bracknell) 8-53.74; 2, N Crosbie (Warrington Warriors)

TWO weeks ago we wondered if it could be done. Master Oats, the
Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, was trying to emulate the only horse who had
ever won that great race and the Grand National in the same year. He
failed, but was not disgraced.
Now, it is the turn of the horse who was the star turn on that day at
Aintree, Royal Athlete, to try to become only the second horse in
history to add the Scottish version of the National at Ayr, now
sponsored by Stakis, to that Aintree triumph in the same season. That is
dependent on whether Jenny Pitman, his trainer, stands by her decision
to run the Aintree hero.
She said yesterday that she wants to have another look at the going,
which has become faster as the week has gone on, before making a final
decision.
Unless the ground becomes really firm, there are major advantages in
the Liverpool winner's favour compared with Master Oats. Unlike that
horse, Royal Athlete will be running on going on which he has been
successful in the past, and maybe not so very different from that which
prevailed at Merseyside, whereas the Gold Cup winner was tackling ground
that was nothing like his preference.
The National victor is also finding his form at the right time of the
season, is reasonably well handicapped, and does not contend with
opposition quite as formidable as Kim Bailey's star took on at Aintree.
That does not mean the old horse has a straightforward task in
equalling the feat of the mighty Red Rum, the only horse to have
completed the double.
However well Pitman's 12-year-old has emerged from his Liverpool
exertions, the demands of another four-miles-and-a-bit chase inside a
fortnight will be enormous and it will take a very special horse,
indeed, to be able to produce top form twice in that space of time.
Pitman runs two others who could do well, Willsford and Do Be Brief,
but if her No.1 comes home in front the cheers might be heard somewhere
close to Pollok Estate.

MORAL DESPERADO A Life of Thomas Carlyle
Simon Heffer Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, #20
HOW many of those who daily pass the signs on the A74 to ''Carlyle's
birthplace'' at Ecclefechan have the least idea who Thomas Carlyle was?
In the Scottish national consciousness he ranks well below Scott and
Burns. In the wider British context his name brings to mind a few
familiar quotations (''the cash nexus'', ''shooting Niagara''); maybe
his shaggy Old Testament countenance still stands out among the
better-groomed whiskers of other Great Victorians such as Arnold,
Newman, Huxley, Mill, and Ruskin. But he is read today probably less
than any of them. His books are in print only in American academic
editions.
Reading Simon Heffer's new biography one realises why. Carlyle is
unread first because his prose is unreadable and second because his
views are unspeakable. Both reflect a disastrous grafting of German
influence on to his native Calvinism. Carlyle formed his prose style
through reading and translating Goethe and the German Romantics. The
result was a verbose, splenetic stream of consciousness weighed down by
portentously capitalised Abstract Nouns and clumsy Germanic neologisms,
every other sentence ending with an emphatic exclamation mark! For a
couple of paragraphs this sort of stuff can be arresting; after that it
quickly becomes laughable, then tedious and -- to the modern reader --
ultimately impenetrable.
But this obscurity is just as well, if it serves to cloak the message.
From Sartor Resartus in the early 1830s to his Latter-Day Pamphlets in
the 1850s Carlyle denounced everything that the educated Victorian mind
held dear: capitalism, Christianity, parliamentary democracy, and the
very idea of progress: he even defended slavery. In so far as he
proposed positive ideas they were either mystical or brutally
reactionary.
In his huge panoramic histories, from The French Revolution (1837) to
the six-volume Frederick the Great (1858-65), he expounded the idea of
the hero, the inspired leader who should rule by power of conquest and
military coercion: the only freedom, the only true right of man should
be to submit gladly to such a leader. This is such repellent tosh that
it is hard to see how anyone could take it seriously. In our own century
it has been seen to lead straight to Hitler, Stalin, and Pol Pot, and
Carlyle's reputation has suffered accordingly. The puzzle is to know why
sophisticated Victorians bought and read such rubbish in enormous
numbers.
I have on my shelves a popular edition of Heroes and Hero-Worship,
inscribed with the name of my wife's grandfather, dated 1 February 1906,
the text diligently marked throughout with pencil markings. Carlyle was
a staple of popular self-education, one of those social critics whom the
first Labour MPs cited as an influence. Yet at this distance it is hard
to see what influence his crazy rants -- directly contrary to the spirit
of the age as we now understand it -- had on public life and politics.
Unfortunately this is a problem which Heffer ducks. He claims that
''without understanding Carlyle one cannot properly understand the
Victorian era''. He quotes George Eliot's striking tribute (written in
1856) that ''there has hardly been an English book written for the last
10 or 12 years that would not have been different if Carlyle had not
lived''. Yet it seems to me he fails to justify either his claim or
Eliot's.
In many ways this is an admirable biography, serious, scholarly, and
thorough, if a trifle dense. It traces the story of Carlyle's life from
his early struggles in Edinburgh and Dumfriesshire to his apotheosis as
the Sage of Cheyne Walk, and his famously turbulent marriage to Jane
Baillie Welsh, not omitting the question of Carlyle's suspected
impotence which lay at the root of their unhappiness. It places him in
his social context, so that alongside the gloomy, obsessive, dyspeptic
workaholic driving himself half-mad and his neglected wife eventually to
death, we are given surprising glimpses of a more sociable animal, a
good talker with an ''ebullient'' sense of humour, and a valued friend
of such men as Dickens, Mill, and Ruskin. Savage in print, he was
actually quite civilised in person: Queen Victoria asked to meet him in
1869, and found him ''a strange-looking eccentric old Scotchman, who
holds forth, in a drawling melancholy voice, with a broad Scotch accent,
upon . . . the utter degeneration of everything''.
Is this the key to his ''influence''? Was it simply a masochistic
streak in Victorian society that enjoyed being lacerated by Carlyle's
anathemas -- rather as we in our puny way are titillated by the
rhetorical doom-mongering of such as Malcolm Muggeridge and Paul
Johnson? For what made Carlyle's repellent views acceptable was
presumably the apocalyptic language in which they were couched. Though
scornful of the humbug of established Christianity, Carlyle believed in
an ordered universe ruled by an all-powerful divinity: his concept of
the hero was to be distinguished from a common tyrant by being divinely
inspired. He denounced the materialism of modern society from a
standpoint of ageless morality: society duly salved its conscience by
revering him as a great teacher -- while thankfully taking not the
blindest notice.
I hope Heffer is not proposing Carlyle as a prophet for our
demoralised fin de siecle. He never says so, beyond a few hints that
some of Carlyle's forebodings have been fulfilled. Lady Thatcher is not
offered as a modern hero. Even the American Far Right might draw the
line at restoring slavery. But any revival of interest in rabid
illiberalism is potentially alarming. I for one hope Carlyle remains
unread.

PLANS by councillors in Argyll to impose tough new controls on
drinking alcohol in public have been rejected by the Scottish Office.
Opponents of the moves to impose bylaws banning drinking in public
across large areas of Argyll have applauded the decision.
Councillor Alison Hay said: ''I am delighted that sanity has
prevailed.''
The moves began with concern over anti-social public drinking in
Dunoon but quickly escalated to cover areas in almost every council ward
in Argyll.
Places such as Connel, Taynuilt, and Dalmally were included in the
proposals as well as what the Scottish Office has termed ''mountainous
areas'' and ''fairly large tracts of countryside''.
In response to the council's proposals, the Scottish Office questioned
how such areas would be signposted or policed.
It also stated that by-laws could not be enforced in a
''discriminatory'' way, adding: ''The family of tourists enjoying a
quiet picnic, including wine or beer, on a seat on the promenade, will
be as much in breach of the by-law as the group of rowdies on a Saturday
night.''
It also pointed out that no exemption for events such as highland
games and local gala days, where alcohol is often drunk outdoors, had
been provided for.
Councillor Hay said that the Scottish Office reservations echoed much
of the earlier criticism of the proposals. ''Our points have been
upheld,'' she said.
She felt that known trouble-spots should be identified and targeted,
but hoped that a widescale approach to the problem would now be dropped.
She said she would now be calling for Inveraray in her ward, which had
been included, to be removed from the draft proposals.
The Scottish Office has told the council that Ministers would be
reluctant to approve by-laws covering areas which the police do not
confirm as trouble-spots in terms of rowdyism or annoyance arising from
drinking in public.

BIG Mac's are not the flavour of the month for Scottish athletics.
Three English clubs -- Chester le Street, Wakefield, and Darlington --
are beefing about travelling to Scotland to compete in the McDonald's
League.
They have withdrawn, causing the north-east division to be scrapped
and leaving John Greig Builders Central Region and Edinburgh AC with no
opponents for the first match a week tomorrow.
''There was no Scottish fixture last year, but we happily travelled
south,'' said EAC's Marjorie Cook. ''Now that we have a match here, they
don't want to know. We joined in order to get better competition, but
that objective is now ruined.''
* FRASER Clyne, the Scottish marathon champion, has had to abandon his
dream of bidding for a fourth successive national crown tomorrow in the
Lochaber Marathon. Clyne, the only man to have matched former
Commonwealth champion Joe McGhee's feat of three consecutive wins, has
not recovered from the Two Oceans 56k race in South Africa.

THE failure of Scotland's women to make an impact in the Atlantic Rim
Games at Durban has become the talk of the event. Sarah Gourlay's
injured wrist continues to keep her out of the side, and her absence has
clearly contributed to a loss of morale.
Yesterday, the world team champions slumped to yet another double
defeat, this time to Jersey.
Eleanor Allan, Scotland's secretary and team manager, has played well
enough in between Liz Dickson and Janice Maxwell, but is really only a
decent club player thrown in at the deep end in a world-class
competition.
Doubts are also being expressed about the wisdom of breaking up the
pairs and triples to cope with Gourlay's withdrawal.
Gourlay was originally selected as Frances Whyte's lead in the pairs,
but Allan was introduced as the No.2 in the triples, with Betty Forsyth
taking Gourlay's place.
Forsyth and Whyte have won only two of their seven games, while
Maxwell's triple have a similar record. Both are languishing in tenth
place out of 12 in the round-robin tables. Results:
Pairs -- Sixth round -- S Africa beat Namibia 40-6; Ireland beat Spain
22-18; England beat Wales 17-13; Scotland beat Guernsey 24-13; Israel
drew with Argentina 19-19; USA beat Jersey 21-17. Seventh round --
Ireland beat Namibia 22-9; Wales beat Spain 23-20; S Africa beat England
30-13; Geurnsey beat Argentina 25-19; USA beat Israel 19-17; Jersey beat
Scotland 17-14.
Triples -- Sixth round -- S Africa beat Namibia 28-9; Spain beat
Ireland 21-16; Wales beat England 26-8; Guernsey beat Scotland 15-10;
Israel beat Argentina 24-6; Jersey beat USA 21-8. Seventh round --
Namibia beat Ireland 15-14; Wales beat Spain 29-6; England beat S Africa
21-18; Argentina beat Guernsey 15-8; Israel beat USA 22-11; Jersey beat
Scotland 20-15.
* SCOT Mark McMahon, now an Australian resident, was halted in his bid
to reach the semi-finals of the Mazda Tweed Classic on the Gold Coast.
Bad light stopped his quarter-final tie with Steve Glasson with the
score at 2-2 in their best-of-five set encounter.
The winner will join former Commonwealth singles gold medallist Rob
Parrella, reigning Commonwealth pairs gold medallist Cameron Curtis, and
Kelvin Kerkow in today's semi-finals.

AS football is a witness this season, it is not always the best teams
which reach the Scottish Cup final, but while two of the
relegation-threatened sides, Western and Touche Ross Gordonians, contest
the final of the men's cup tomorrow this should not in any way detract
from the occasion at Peffermill.
Western were beaten finalists there last season while Gordonians won
the trophy 12 months earlier, and so their familiarity with the most
dreaded surface in the country just might produce a game to compare
favourably with some of the classics of the past.
The preparation of both clubs has been disrupted by the suspension of
key players. Gordonians will have to do without Philip Webster and Simon
Balchin while Western are minus Graham Joyce. The latter have former
internationalist Niall Stirrock dovetailing into Joyce's position, and
with Dougie Miller also winning a place in their attack, the Glasgow
side look well equipped to repeat their triumph of 1986.

<HEADLINE>#55,000 for four discharged from forces when pregnant</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978763919</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FOUR former Servicewomen who were discharged because they were
pregnant have been awarded a total of #55,000 in compensation.
Former RAF nurse Mrs Jennifer McManus, who had been expecting twins,
was awarded #9611.
An industrial tribunal in Glasgow was told that Mrs McManus, 33, of
Woodhead View, Westfield, Cumbernauld, had been a senior aircraftswoman
who had signed up for nine years. However, she was discharged after four
years service' in March 1985. Four months later, she gave birth to a
baby boy, Benjamin, but a scan showed that she had miscarried a twin
earlier in her pregnancy.
Mrs McManus said her mother would have looked after her son to allow
her to return to the RAF. Two years later, she had another baby.
The tribunal concluded that although Mrs McManus would have returned
after her first child it was likely that she would have resigned from
the Service after her second child was born. Compensation for lost wages
was cut by 50% because of her failure to find other work to mitigate her
loss of income since being discharged.
Former Wren Mrs Jane Frazer, of Drumduan Park, Forres, Morayshire, was
awarded #23,261 compensation.
Mrs Frazer, 29, who has since joined Grampian Police, told the Glasgow
tribunal that a posting to Hong Kong and a place on a leadership course
were cancelled when she became pregnant.
She was serving on HMS Condor when she discovered she was pregnant,
and said that she was devastated at having to leave the Navy.
She told the tribunal that her parents and mother-in-law would have
been prepared to look after her son to allow her to take up her posting
in Hong Kong, since her husband was a Royal Marine whose tours of duty
meant he was away for extended periods. She gave birth to a second
child, a daughter, three years after she was discharged.
The tribunal ruled she would have returned and continued serving until
her second child was born and awarded her #23,261.
Former RAF aircraftswoman Ms Anne Cameron was awarded #12,576
compensation by an Inverness industrial tribunal for her early discharge
on the grounds of pregnancy.
Ms Cameron, 39, of Provost Christie Drive, Rothes, Moray, had left the
service when she married but had rejoined later when her marriage broke
down. She was discharged when she became pregnant.
She then took an unpaid job as a live-in nanny. Three years ago, she
applied to rejoin the RAF but was not accepted because of cutbacks.
She told the tribunal that she had been upset at being discharged, but
was not aware this was a matter of forces' policy.
In the fourth case, an industrial tribunal, which met last month over
two days in Inverness and Aberdeen, awarded #9543 to RAF flying officer
Mrs Corinne Thirkell, 45, of Muirton Place, Kinloss, Morayshire.
Mrs Thirkell had successfully applied to rejoin the service after the
younger of her two children had started nursery education.
She and her husband separated in 1993 but both are still serving in
the RAF.
In each case, the Ministry of Defence conceded sex discrimination. The
tribunals only had to decide the scale of the awards.

IF, later today, you notice that Craig Chalmers moves the ball through
his hands that little bit quicker than usual, then what you have seen is
the quiet influence of one of Murrayfield's latest appointments. On
April 1, Roy Laidlaw, one of the legendary Scottish rugby players,
started his new job as National Squad Co-ordinator, a further move in
what you might call Jim Telfer's pursuit of excellence -- and success on
the international pitch.
''It's one of my jobs to develop the adult players at the top end of
the scale, and we speak to them and advise them on little parts of their
play that will help,'' says Laidlaw. I watched Roy stay on after one
Sunday session with Derrick Paterson and take him on some protracted
exercises to speed up his pass, likewise I saw him take Craig Joiner for
individual skills designed to help him chip over his opponent on the
full.
''We can video the players in practice at Murrayfield, and spot some
of their weaker points,'' says Laidlaw. ''If they don't believe us, then
we can take them inside and show them the tape.''
All of which takes Scotland ever nearer the Australian model, which
has upwards of a hundred people dedicated in their back-up to aid David
Campese and Co's rugby effort. New South Wales has a rugby set up that
is bigger than that of the SRU, and, in preparation for the World Cup,
the Australian squad has held week-long sessions with 45 players . . .
and a support staff of 60.
''I'll be setting up the necessary systems to assess our best players,
and give any technical help to the coaches they need,'' says Laidlaw.
Laidlaw will take things further on this summer's sojourn to South
Africa. He will be travelling with an address book full of the contact
numbers of his opposites in the South African Rugby Union, and he will
be armed with a video camera to take shots of the South African and
Australian teams in training in Cape Town while the rest of Scotland
will concentrate on the efforts of Gavin Hastings and his men.
''I want to try to watch and video as much as I can of those teams
training, and get an insight into their methods,'' he says. ''I also
want to look into their school system, and see how their club rugby is
organised, and generally scout about and catch games.''
Like Telfer, Laidlaw was in Romania to watch the Under-19s do battle
in the FIRA tournament, and that provided him with a valuable insight
into a body of young men over whom he will start to exert a great deal
of influence. He liked what he saw.
''It did these players good to play four internationals in such a
short space of time,'' he says. ''I hope to start identifying which of
those players will be elite players and then they will get special help
and attention.''
Laidlaw has no doubts that many of the players were gripped with fear
at the thought of being followed so closely by manager David Sole, Jim
Telfer, and Roy himself, but he was at pains to point out to some of
those that confided their fears that if they are ever to succeed at the
highest level then they will be examined a damn sight closer still and
would just have to get used to it.
Yet each one of those young players had one common deficiency that he
says will have to be rectified. ''We found out one thing, and that is
that our players are physically inferior. Much skinnier.
''We have to bulk these players up -- and it's going to be my job to
suggest ways of doing that.''
And although the rugby world these youngsters are about to enter is a
changing one, with talk of impending professionalism, Laidlaw, for one,
hopes that the wind of change does not blow too far.
''I would like the game to stay amateur. Why do we have to be like
every other game? The key may be to help employers look after players.
''I am scared that, if the game becomes pro, it will start to take on
some of the worse aspects of professional sport -- the sensationalism,
the money-grabbing, players changing their attitudes.''
Laidlaw is an enthusiast that has probably never made an enemy in his
life. His rugby knowledge is superb. His young charges will never get a
better hand to help them cope with the demands of their bold new rugby
world. Laidlaw always was the ideal man to back you up on the
international pitch.
What am I talking about? The wee so and so was almost always miles in
front!

SNOOKER: WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP
THE Crucible clash which many believe would make the perfect Embassy
World Championship final will take place in the quarter-finals after
Ronnie O'Sullivan earned a meeting with holder Stephen Hendry.
Shrugging off a bout of tonsilitis, O'Sullivan completed a 13-8
victory over Welshman Darren Morgan after having overcome an 8-4 deficit
on Thursday night.
''I cannot wait to get it on with Stephen,'' said the 19-year-old from
Essex, looking ahead to their mouth-watering clash, which will start on
Monday.
''I cannot believe I've reached the quarter-finals playing like
this,'' he said. ''What is the standard of snooker coming to these days?
I was playing better when I was 12. You must believe me when I say I
have not played anywhere near my best.''
His relatively disappointing form, especially during the early part of
yesterday's second session, can now be put down to his hushed-up
illness. Tournament director Ann Yates said: ''He's been on antibiotics
since the opening day of the championship, but he's feeling 100% now.''
Morgan said: ''Ronnie is an unbelievable player and deserves what he
gets. I wish I was 19 again with his talent. But I'm nearly 29 and have
not got his talent.''
The turning point of the match came on Thursday night with Morgan 8-5
ahead when a spectator collapsed in the arena, an incident which upset
him. Morgan lost the frame and eventually finished the night level at
8-8.
Hendry reached his seventh successive world quarter-final yesterday
morning, taking only 40 minutes to complete a 13-6 triumph over Malta's
Tony Drago. He now stands just one away from equalling the 18
consecutive wins at the Crucible set by Steve Davis between 1987 and
1990.
The defending champion then revealed another ambition. He said: ''It
would be nice to make a televised maximum break, especially at the World
Championship, and given an opportunity when the frame is safe, I'll be
trying for it.
''I think someone might do it this year. Players are opting to take
the tricky shots rather than the easy option if they think the maximum
is on.''
After his stunning defeat of six-times champion Steve Davis,
left-hander Andy Hicks raced to 4-0 against Willie Thorne, including a
break of exactly 100, and finished the session 6-2 up.
In the battle of the grinders, Gary Wilkinson maintained his
three-frame overnight lead over Welsh veteran Terry Griffiths following
their morning session, with Griffiths taking the last two frames to cut
the deficit to 9-6. It still proved too great a gap and, as the standard
improved last night, Wilkinson produced breaks of 72, 57, 80, and then a
61 to complete victory by 13-9.
John Parrott, who has the highest break of the tournament so far, 129,
was back on the century trail last night with 110 in the fith frame
against Joe Swail. He also had runs of 65 and 52 but the Belfast player,
who had breaks of 63 and 50, takes a 5-3 lead into tonight's second
session.
Today's order of play:
1pm: David Roe (England) v Jimmy White (England); Nigel Bond (England)
v Alan McManus (Scotland).
7.30: Joe Swail (N Ireland) leads John Parrott (England) 5-3; Andy
Hicks (England) leads Willie Thorne (England) 6-2.

TWO sixth-formers yesterday relived their hazardous ascent of the
8000ft New Zealand mountain named after their school's founder.
Fiona O'Reilly and Alex Michie, both 17, were part of a group from
Fettes College in Edinburgh who travelled to the southern hemisphere to
follow in the footsteps of Scottish explorer Charles Douglas -- the
grand-nephew of Sir William Fettes.
The expedition was set up to mark the 125th anniversary of the school,
which boasts Labour leader Tony Blair among its former pupils.
Fiona and Alex made the three-hour climb on the final stage in
freezing conditions, over glaciers and 60-metre crevasses, during a
brief let-up in bad weather on April 2.
The teenagers, roped to two guides to make the first known ascent of
the peak in 60 years, feared they would have to spend the night on the
mountain when the weather took a turn for the worse.
However, a brief respite enabled them to be airlifted by helicopter
back to the base camp, beside their four schoolmates -- Margaret
Willington, Jonathan Bowman, Iain Benson, and Paul King.
Only two members of the party were permitted to make the ascent
because of the weather conditions.
''We buried a tin as a sort of time capsule on the summit, containing
mementoes from the Lord Provost of Edinburgh and from our school.''
Alex said it was only on the descent that the full danger of the climb
had come home to him.
The two-and-a-half week expedition followed the trail of Douglas. The
adventurer was born in 1840 and emigrated to the Antipodes in 1862. He
was the first to scale and name the peak, 20 miles south-west of Mount
Cook, in 1885.

ROWING
SCOTTISH rowing's summer competitive season gets under way today with
the biggest-ever Strathclyde International Regatta being held on the
Olympic course at Strathclyde Park.
Not only has the event attracted its largest entry yet of over 500
crews, it is starting to live up to its international tag with crews
from Belgium, England, Ireland and Norway, as well as a healthy domestic
entry.
This flagship event of the SARA now becomes the largest domestic-based
regatta to be held in Scotland, beating the long-standing entry records
of the successful Clyde Rowing Weekends in the early eighties.
It is no coincidence that the event has mushroomed since it muscled in
on the traditional early season date three seasons ago that up until
then had been used by the Clyde regatta. Only the World Veteran Meeting
of 1988, which was also staged at Strathclyde Park, has been a bigger
event.
Racing action starts at nine o'clock today and even earlier tomorrow.

DONNIE Hood, the former WBC International bantamweight champion from
Glasgow, last night saw his comeback grind to a halt when he lost to
Maybole's Shaun Anderson over eight rounds at the Hospitality Inn,
Glasgow.
Hood, floored early on, can take credit for lasting the eight rounds,
but the verdict was never in doubt.
Anderson will now face Scottish bantam champion James Murray
(Newmains) on the Frank Bruno bill at the Kelvin Hall next month. Murray
produced his best performance yet by stopping Dewsbury's Ady Benton in
the sixth round.
At light-welter, Saltcoats' Jim Montgomerie won his second
professional bout by outpointing Huddersfield's Chris Aston, while
Glasgow lightweight Rocky Ferrari retired on his stool at the end of the
third round against Denmark's Jhij Vierela because of an eye injury.

<HEADLINE>Aviemore village split by row over fees.  Timeshare owners face eviction</HEADLINE>

THE management of an award- winning timeshare development at Aviemore
is trying to evict owners who have not paid fees which a Sheriff
Principal had ruled the company cannot legally charge.
The ruling was appealed and is still the subject of dispute. However,
in Aviemore today Scandinavian Village Ltd will ask the annual general
meeting of its association of shareholders to confiscate properties with
values between #2000 and #10,000 from timeshare owners who have failed
to pay the company's charges.
One of the owners involved said it appeared as if the firm was
ignoring the law.
Compensation will be at the discretion of the committee which
administers the village of more than 50 houses, built in the early
1980s.
Some of those facing confiscation have not paid the legitimate charge
of about #120 the company levies for managing the village. Others have
refused to pay charges for cleaning and linen which the company
unilaterally added to its agreement with timeshare owners in 1990.
The new charges were around #20 to #30, but were resisted because some
owners believed they had been specifically precluded by the original
agreement between them and the company.
The position was further complicated by owners having to become
members of the Scandinavian Village Association as a condition of their
owners' licence. The association, which was entitled to raise and
forward money to the company, supported the new charges.
The company took legal action against one timeshare owner, a local
government official, Mr Charles Robson, from Southsea, Hampshire, who
had refused to pay the additional charges. The firm lost and appealed.
In June 1993, Sheriff Principal Douglas Risk in a written judgment
again found for Mr Robson, saying: ''I am clearly of the opinion that
the association had no power to alter the terms of said clauses.
''The defender was accordingly entitled to refuse to pay the purported
supplementary charges. It follows that the pursuers and appellants are
not entitled to the sum sued for.''
However, Mr Robson was suspended from using his timeshare. Last night,
he said he was astonished that the agm was being asked to approve the
confiscations: ''The Sheriff Principal rules that the company has acted
wrongly but his judgment has been ignored and withheld from
shareholders. I intended to raise the matter at an agm but was ejected
without being allowed to speak.
''I am suspended from occupying my holiday home; deprived of my right
of notice of annual general meetings; and denied voting rights as a
shareholder. It seems to be a case of we'll just ignore the law and make
our own rules.
''The court agrees I was in the right, but now I could stand to lose
my timeshare worth #6000. Shareholders must question the chairman and
committee about why the court's decision was withheld from them and
fully consider the legal implications of the resolution.''
Another in dispute is a Lanark-based waste management consultant, Mr
William Campbell, who first bought a village timeshare in 1981. ''I
suffered suspension after refusing to pay charges which exceeded
contracted management fees. My decision was a matter of principle and
involved #23,'' he said.
''Despite the sheriff's judgment and my offer to pay legitimate fees
the company refused to lift my suspension. It is sad we can't enjoy our
holiday flat, and we are now at risk of losing an asset worth around
#2000 because the company won't accept the sheriff's decision.''
However, Mr Vic Turnbull, manager and company secretary of
Scandinavian Village Ltd, said yesterday: ''We appealed the sheriff's
decision and the other party didn't turn up so our appeal was
successful. I don't know if he is now appealing against that or where we
are.''
The Herald understands that Mr Robson is indeed appealing, but Mr Iain
Gilchrist, the Glasgow-based chartered accountant who is chairman of the
village association, said last night: ''We have got a decree for the
sums involved which suggests the sheriff agrees with us.
''Mr Robson can say or do what he likes. I am not going to deal with
this today. It would be quite inappropriate for me to make a premature
statement.''

William Hjortsberg: NEVERMORE (Orion, #9.99).
* WILLIAM Hjortsberg, like some of his characters in Nevermore,
specialises in raising the dead. Harry Houdini, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,
Damon Runyon, and the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe are the leading players
in this shamelessly fantastical spook mystery, in which keen
spiritualist Sir Arthur turns Sherlock Holmes to solve a series of
murders modelled on the tales of Poe. To copy the method of The Black
Cat is one thing, but disbelief goes unsuspended when the killer is
called upon to re-create The Pit And The Pendulum. Enjoyable, though,
for its 1920s New York settings and its evocation of the slightly
sinister carney world of stage magic and seances.
Joseph Heller: SOMETHING HAPPENED (Vintage, #5.99).
* BOB Slocum, garrulous anti-hero of Joseph Heller's 1974 follow-up to
Catch-22, is a man with a lot on his mind and no compunction about
passing it on. Job trouble, wife trouble, kids trouble, girlfriend
trouble, guilt trouble, self-loathing trouble . . . he's a walking
anatomy lesson for students of white, male, middle-class malaise, 1970s
vintage. In these harder times, however, the 600-page confessional of a
selfish, self-pitying neurotic with an ego the size of a corporate
skyscraper comes across more as petulant self-indulgence than as any
kind of insight into the human condition. There's a lot to be said for
the strong, silent type.
Deborah Lipstadt: DENYING THE HOLOCAUST: The Growing Assault On Truth
And Memory (Penguin, #8.99).
* In this superbly contemptuous riposte to the ''Did Six Million
Really Die?'' gang, Deborah Lipstadt is less concerned to rehearse the
overwhelming evidence for the Holocaust (though that is here too) than
to expose their political agenda and to analyse the tricks --
half-truths, big lies, distraction -- by which the Holocaust deniers
have achieved a worrying measure of credibility. Holocaust deniers, she
warns, are dangerous not only because they hate the Jews, but because
they seek to plant a lie in history. As George Orwell pointed out, it's
this desire to control the truth that lies at the heart of
totalitarianism.
Richard Russo: NOBODY'S FOOL (Vintage, #5.99).
* Smalltown eccentricity, American style; and amiably enough done at
that, in the manner of Garrison Keillor and John Irving. Nobody's Fool
(coming soon to a cinema near you, with Paul Newman in the lead) is the
story of Sully, one of those innocently irresponsible middle-aged
ne'er-do-wells beloved of American novelists, and his difficult
relationship with his go-getting, live-wire son. Background colour is
supplied by the usual Mudville supporting cast of fruit, nuts, and
flakes, and although its cosy, feelgood resolution is never in doubt,
Russo's easy-going, conversational style maintains the reader's goodwill
through a long novel. Easy on the ear, mind, and heart.

CLYDE shipbuilder Yarrow may be about to enter the battle for the
Ferguson yard at Port Glasgow.
It is understood that Yarrow, which is owned by defence electronics
company GEC, has asked for a look at Ferguson's books.
Ferguson finance director, Mr Richard Deane, confirmed yesterday that
a third party had contacted the yard this week, to find out what stage
moves by two other suitors were at, and to advise the Port Glasgow
shipbuilder of its interest.
He said the third party was Scottish, but refused to confirm or deny
whether it was Yarrow.
Scottish businessman Mr Frank Dunnet is believed to be prepared to bid
slightly more than #4 for each of Ferguson's 1,200,000 shares.
Meanwhile, Altnacraig Shipping which, like Ferguson, is a Business
Expansion Scheme company, has indicated it is prepared to table an offer
of #3 cash plus an as yet undetermined number of Altnacraig shares. Its
bid would be more advantageous, in tax terms, for BES investors.
Industrialist Sir Ross Belch, who is chairman of the Port Glasgow
shipbuilder's holding company, Ferguson Marine, also chairs Altnacraig.
However, there is little doubt that GEC's war chest is huge compared
with those of the other two bidders.
A decision on the original two proposals had been expected on
Wednesday of next week, when the directors of Ferguson meet. However, Mr
Deane said discussions and negotiations could be kept open if a third
bid materialised.
He added: ''We want to get what is right for the business and what is
right for the shareholders.''
Even if an offer is recommended by Ferguson's directors and put to
shareholders, a rival bidder would still have three weeks to make its
move.
In some ways, the activities of Ferguson, highly regarded as a maker
of small specialist Naval vessels, might complement those of Yarrow,
whose mainstay is the destroyer market.
With defence business dwindling by the year, Ferguson might see
Yarrow, which employs about 3000 people, through thin periods.
Unlike Yarrow, Ferguson, which employs 320 people, also builds
merchant vessels, such as passenger ferries.

THE Scottish Claymores have some catching up to do when they take on
Frankfurt Galaxy in Germany today, following defeats by Rheinfire and
Barcelona Dragons.
Nevertheless, head coach Jim Criner is confident his side can turn
their fortunes around. ''We have been so close to victory, but just
haven't been able to pull it out,'' said Criner.
''But the team is upbeat. Our defence has been playing well enough to
keep us in the matches, we are just having trouble scoring. It's got to
turn our way.''
Against Barcelona the Claymores lost out to a couple of dubious
refereeing decision -- negating what looked like two sure touchdowns
when first Tim Barnett was adjudged out of bounds and later when Siran
Stacy looked to have broken the Dragons' goal-line only to be thwarted
again by the officials.
Linebacker Ricky Andrews, cornerback Jocelyn Borgella and free safety
Darrell Lewis are all doubtful for today's match. If they miss out it
will make things even tougher for the Scots.

NIGEL Mansell has virtually written off his chances of winning the
Formula One drivers' championship after missing the first two grands
prix of the year.
The former world champion will race in the San Marino Grand Prix a
week on Sunday in a redesigned McLaren MP4-10 after complaining the
cockpit of the original car was too small.
Mansell, the 1992 champion, will test the car at Imola before deciding
whether to race for the first time since he agreed a reputed #7m deal.
Mansell's link-up with Mika Hakkinen will relegate fellow Briton Mark
Blundell back to the sidelines.

CRICKET
CURTLY Ambrose was back to his devastating best as he spearheaded a
West Indies demolition of Australia's batting on the first day of the
third test yesterday.
At tea the tourists, who were sent in on a lush green wicket, were
reeling at 112 for seven with a battered and bruised Steve Waugh on 54
not out and playing a brave, lone hand.
Behind 1-0 in the four-match series, Richie Richardson's side played
aggressive cricket from the first ball at Queen's Park Oval, Australia
losing their first two wickets with only two runs on the board.
They slumped to 14 for three, 37 for four and then 62 for five before
Waugh, taking balls on the upper body and arms from Ambrose and Kenny
Benjamin, combined with Ian Healy to snick and occasionally bludgeon
Australia past their lowest ever total in a Caribbean test -- 90 made
here in 1978.
But it was only a temporary reprive as Healy (8) and Brendon Julian
(0) were dismissed to leave leave Australia on 98 for seven.
By tea, all five bowlers used by Richardson had claimed a wicket, but
Ambrose's three for 35 was the pick.
Waugh stuck to his guns admirably as wickets fell about him and had a
well deserved piece of good fortune when Ambrose made a mess of a chance
to catch him off Kenny Benjamin's bowling.
Rain fell nearly as often as Australian wickets during the course of
the day, forcing the umpires to take an early lunch and preventing play
from resuming on time after tea.
* WHEN Malcolm Marshall is introduced to his Scotland team-mates prior
to tomorrow's Benson and Hedges Cup game against Worcestershire, there
will be at least one face the great West Indian all-rounder recognises.
Uddingston's George Reifer -- who will open for the Scots tomorrow --
first met Marshall when the latter skippered the Barbados under-19 side
back in 1977. Nearly two decades on, the Caribbean clan join their
adopted countymen against one of the county circuit's big boys.
But, given who Reifer -- who has played as an adopted Scot for four
years -- learned his trade beside, first as a teenager then in the
islands senior team, he is hardly overawed by facing names like Hick,
Curtis, Moody or Rhodes.
''Malcolm was always special, even as a teenager,'' recalled Reifer.
''He was a good bat, but bowling -- he was rapid.''

CANNES OPEN
IAN Woosnam's hopes of retaining his Cannes Open title suffered a
setback at Royal Mougins last night when he finished his second round
with a triple bogey and an injury worry.
The hole which 24 hours earlier had seen Colin Montgomerie hit an
eagle putt into a lake cost Woosnam an 8 and dropped him back into the
pack.
''I had a bit of spasm in my neck during the round and never hit a
decent shot all afternoon,'' said the Welshman. ''I never should have
tried to carry the lake.''
The ball splashed into the water and, after sending his next attempt
into a bunker at the back of the green, he compounded the mistake by
three-putting.
Immediately after signing for a 73 and a two-round total of 140, two
under par, Woosnam went off to seek treatment. ''My shoulder hurt as
well and I just couldn't get through the ball,'' he said.
Swiss World Cup player Andre Bossert, who has never finished higher
than sixth on the European Tour, added a 67 to his opening 65, and with
an aggregate of 132, 10 under par, he leads by two strokes from French
No.1 Jean Van de Velde and Norwegian rookie Oyvind Rojahn.
Bossert achieved a notable first, keeping a bogey off his card for the
first time on the circuit, and in the evening gloom he almost matched
South African Retief Goosen's hole-in-one at the 139-yard seventeenth.
''I could just about see it lip out,'' he said. A tap-in followed
other birdies at the first, fifth and fifteenth.
Rojahn, playing in the penultimate group, had to cope with even darker
conditions, but two birdies in the last five holes took the 23-year-old
tour school qualifier to another 67 and into a tie for second. In his
previous nine starts this season he has missed the cut eight times.
Van de Velde, joint first-round leader with Swede Mathias Gronberg,
was far from unhappy with his 70. ''The wind was swirling and pin
positions were a lot tougher,'' he said.
David Gilford and Andrew Coltart kept up their challenge for the
#50,000 first prize, rounds of 65 and 69 respectively lifting them to
seven under.
Gilford did not drop a stroke and birdied all four short holes, but
24-year-old Coltart, runner-up to Philip Walton in the Catalan Open on
Sunday, finished disappointingly by three-putting the roller-coaster
eighteenth green for a bogey 6.
''It was pretty frustrating,'' he said. ''I thought my third was a
decent shot, but it came up a yard short then rolled 40 feet away.''
Gilford commented: ''If I play like when I won the European Open last
year I take a lot of beating by anyone. I'm obviously not as good as
people like Nick Faldo, but the best do not always win in golf.''
Montgomerie, whose last victory was eight months ago, remained in the
race at four under with a 70.
Barry Lane had to retire after nine painful holes of his second round.
He slipped on wet steps coming out of his hotel and jarred an ankle.

ROBERT KENNEDY The final years
Brian Dooley
Keele University Press, #14.99
DESPITE a singular talent for constructing petards and hoisting
himself without any assistance from his opponents, Dan Quayle will
always be remembered as the senator who was ''no Jack Kennedy''. The
irony of Bobby Kennedy's political career is that although his
development from old-style conservative to new liberal distanced him
from his brother's policies, it was the charisma fall-out from Dealey
Plaza which underpinned his popularity.
At the 1992 Democratic Convention in New York, delegates stood silent
for 20 minutes while a documentary on RFK was shown, proving that his
image as the Sir Galahad of the Camelot court still resists revision,
only partly because his vaunted idealism was never subjected to the
ultimate test of Presidential power -- those who fall in battle are
considered heroes whether they take the garrison or not.
This sympathetic study traces the origins and growth of Kennedy's
radical agenda to the three years he served as Senator for New York
(1965-68), during which time he shuffled off the mantle of baby brother
and overturned his hawkish reputation as the man who had broken Hoffa's
Teamsters' Union, promoted the Green Berets as a counter-insurgency task
force and out-brinked Kruschev over the Cuban missiles crisis (though
this was later shown to be a false picture of events).
But he was not averse to capitalising on his tough-guy image in
tussles with Eugene McCarthy, a more consistent left-winger who had
all-important support among blue-collar whites. Kennedy's late
announcement of his candidacy led some to brand him as an opportunist,
and the question remains: how cynical was his ideological volte-face?
Dooley argues that his Senate experience was more a road to Damascus
than a shortcut to Washington, citing Bobby's championing of politically
unprofitable causes such as native Indian education, Californian migrant
workers' unions, and ghetto enterprise zones which challenged the
powerful business community. Indeed, his stance against the Vietnam war
and calls for negotiation with Hanoi came before full-scale public
disillusion, albeit after McCarthy's similar suggestions.
At the time of his assassination in June '68 he had harnessed the
support of a broad coalition including young, radical, underprivileged
and, most notably, black voters, among whom not even Jesse Jackson has
achieved equivalent devotion. While Eldridge Cleaver suggested that he
was ''too white to be all right'', the evidence is that the inner-city
vote could have swung the election for Kennedy and ensured that he
remained committed to being part of the solution. As it was, the
fragmentation of the New Left, and Nixon's narrow victory in November,
slammed the gates on Eden, leaving America's domestic problems
unchallenged for at least another generation.

A MAN who killed two of his girlfriends was jailed for life at the Old
Bailey yesterday.
Passing sentence on 50-year-old Anthony Lewis, Judge John Murchie said
he must serve 10 years before he could be considered for parole.
Lewis denied murdering Mrs Marilyn Thompson, 48 -- the widow of his
best friend and a mother of four -- but admitted manslaughter on the
grounds of diminished responsibility.
Mr John Nutting, QC, prosecuting, accepted the plea since
psychiatrists had agreed that Lewis was suffering from a depressive
illness. They also agreed there was ''no guarantee'' he would not kill
again if he became depressed.
He told the court the killing of Mrs Thompson bore ''remarkable
similarities'' to the killing of Ms Angela James, 26. She also had been
Lewis's girlfriend. He stabbed and battered her to death while suffering
from depression.
He had admitted her manslaughter on the grounds of diminished
responsibility and was jailed for six years at Winchester Crown Court in
1988.
While in prison he was visited regularly by his only friend, Mr
Phillip Thompson, occasionally accompanied by his wife Marilyn.
In 1992, Mr Thompson was killed in a car accident. When Lewis was
released a few months later, Mrs Thompson allowed him to live at her
home in Burnt Oak, Middlesex, and was his sole financial support.
The pair began an affair, but when this ended, Lewis remained as a
lodger, said Mr Nutting. The relationship had ''its ups and downs'' and
once Mrs Thompson had to call police because of Lewis's behaviour.
She also sought an injunction against him but when she moved home she
allowed him to move in with her again.
He complained of depression and a doctor prescribed him
anti-depressant drugs -- but he failed to take them.
Mrs Thompson moved back to Burnt Oak last August and visited Lewis at
his bedsit. Hours later Lewis, looking ''spaced out and strange'',
called the police from a neighbour's telephone and confessed that he had
killed Mrs Thompson.
Police and paramedics found Mrs Thompson lying naked on the floor with
stab wound to her neck and chest and strangulation marks, caused by a
dressing-gown cord.
Lewis admitted killing her and said: ''My mind has been gone for two
or three weeks''.
Mr Nutting said before each killing Lewis had suffered from depression
and anxiety and had experienced problems about finding somewhere to
live.
Although doctors agreed he was suffering from a depressive illness
they said a sentence under the Mental Health Act was not available nor
appropriate. They also agreed that until his illness was completely
cured there was no guarantee he would not kill again and it was unlikely
that any prison sentence would have any deterrent effect.
Mr Anthony Berry, QC, in mitigation, said depression ran deep in Lewis
along with feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness and inadequacy.
Relatives of Mrs Thompson left court calling for the return of the
death penalty. Mrs Thompson's two youngest children, boys of seven and
10, are being cared for by relatives.

GREATER GREENSBORO OPEN
GENIAL American Peter Jacobsen continued a banner year to move within
a stroke of leader Kirk Triplett after the second round at the $1.5m
Kmart Greater Greensboro Open yesterday in North Carolina.
Jacobsen, who is second on this year's US Tour money list thanks
largely to two early-season victories, took advantage of soft greens to
card a bogey-free seven-under-par 65 on the Forest Oaks course.
He twice holed out from bunkers -- at the fourteenth from 20 feet, and
two holes later from 55 feet.
''Confidence is such a huge part of the game,'' he said. ''I'm now
getting to each tournament and thinking 'what are my chances of
winning?' ''.
Fellow American Triplett also shot a flawless 65 to take the halfway
lead at 11-under 133.
''Getting off to a hot start, I was thinking a low number all the way.
I had a hot putter,'' said Triplett, who made four straight birdies from
his second hole.
European Tour member Vijay Singh, a joint first-round leader, shot 72
to slip four strokes behind after two late bogeys. Leading scores (US
player unless stated):
133 -- Kirk Triplett 68, 65.
134 -- Peter Jacobsen 69, 65.
135 -- Jeff Sluman 70, 65; Brad Bryant 69, 66; Hal Sutton 67, 68.
136 -- Steve Lowery 65, 71; John Adams 70, 66; Brad Faxon 65, 71.
137 -- Vijay Singh (Fiji) 65, 72; Lee Janzen 70, 67; Davis Love 66,
71.
Europeans: 138 -- Jesper Parnevik (Sweden) 70, 68. 142 -- David
Feherty (Northern Ireland) 69, 73.
* SEVE Ballesteros and his caddie, Billy Foster, have parted company.
A statement said that after the US Masters a fortnight ago, where the
Spanish player finished forty-fifth, the pair ''agreed that a change
would be good for them.''
Foster was thinking of giving up being a full-time caddie until
Ballesteros approached him five years ago.
Javier Carriles, the brother of European Tour player Jose Manuel, will
carry the player's bag when he partners Jose Maria Olazabal in the Pairs
tournament in Paris next week.

GIORGIO VASARI: Art and History
Patricia Lee Rubin
Yale University Press, #35
SO was Michelangelo really rough and wild; Raphael an affable polite
guy? And what about Donatello? For 445 years art lovers and academics
have been checking with Giorgio Vasari whose Lives of the Painters,
Sculptors and Architects, is perhaps the most important book on the
history of art ever written: full of in-depth contemporary reporting,
interpretation, academic comment -- and anecdote.
Through his Lives Vasari literally invented not only Renaissance art
but created heroes who remain top names today. To be omitted from his
Lives, a vast undertaking listing 142 artists from the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, was to fall into oblivion for ever.
Michelangelo (35 years his senior and his idol) is the climax of the
story but Vasari set his standards of work and behaviour by the
well-behaved Raphael, who died when Vasari was nine, a year after
Leonardo da Vinci.
Our whole concept of the artist as genius comes from Vasari. He was an
artist who became an author in order to make the artists of his day --
himself included -- famous. There was no precedent for artist PR back in
1550 so Vasari employed the mode of biography generally applied to
statesmen or saints -- and maintained a discreet silence on his heroes'
relative failures.
Rubin is a fan of Vasari, but feels that to read him without
historical perspective results in a limited and distorted view, so she
has set about examining his aims and principles; the nuances of his
vocabulary and much more. She doesn't discuss all 142 Lives -- ''Such
treatment would be more exhausting than exhaustive, and certainly
unwieldy'' -- but focuses on Giotto, Donatello, and Raphael.
Rubin claims the book is dedicated to a varied readership of novices
and experts. Certainly the illustrations of his work are glorious, and
show Vasari (who worked in Florence and Rome for Duke Cosimo, Pope Pius
V, and others) to have been an excellent painter as well as an
indefatigable entrepreneur. However, those pages which are more than
half-filled by footnotes -- some Italian at that -- are a bit
off-putting.
All this detail does make wonder what on earth future historians will
do when fax paper fades in weeks and electronic tapes wipe themselves
blank. Luckily oil paint lasts.

HIGH FIDELITY, Nick Hornby, Gollancz, #14.99
NICK Hornby's previous book, Fever Pitch, concerned a thirtysomething
bloke who was obsessed with Arsenal Footbal Club. Its remarkable success
is certain to be repeated with this, his first novel.
For both books exploit Hornby's uncanny ability to chronicle the
difficulties of having a man's body trapped in a teenage mind. Pop music
has replaced football as the central obsession, though the tone and
voice are so close to Fever Pitch as to obliterate the boundary between
fact and fiction.
It is a dull, vagely monotonous, self-obsessed voice which
communicates in cliches and has a fondness for lists. It has a
recognisable warmth, especially when it is being enthusiastic, but
Hornby's real achievement lies in its intimacy, the way it celebrates
the ordinary in a style and tone that is reminiscent of Diary of a
Nobody.
Rob Fleming is a 35-year-old single, sad man, who is the proprietor of
a north London record shop. His lists are of his personal, all-time
favourite songs, girlfriends, best guitar solos and so on. Pop music and
its argot are his means of communication; music the guide to his own
experience.
If your life is awful there is always great music, and Rob believes no
serious person has less than 500 albums. He makes up lists with his
friends Dick and Barry while the shop runs into bankruptcy. Rob is
seriously in need of a life. He has lost his way and suspects it may
have something to do with Laura.
The book begins with: ''My desert island, all-time, five most
memorable split-ups, in chronological order.'' This is followed by five
girls' names, beginning with Alison Ashworth in 1972. The list was
precipitated by Laura leaving for a man who used to live upstairs, a man
with dungarees and a Leo Sayers haircut, whose lovemaking could be heard
through the ceiling.
''Tuesday night I reorganised my record collection; I often do this at
periods of emotional stress. There are some people who would find this a
pretty dull way to spend an evening, but I'm not one of them . . . When
Laura was here I had the records arranged alphabetically . . . Tonight,
though, I fancy something different, so I tried to remember the order I
bought them in . . .''
Rob is adrift, by turn arrogant and pathetic; emotionally retarded, he
fantasises about his love having the power to rescue a good woman who
has snap, crackle, and pop. A female friend points out he is frightened
of women with better jobs and prospects. Laura is now a successful
lawyer.
Rob phones old girlfriends, or their mothers, to find he has either
been forgotten or is remembered as not being as pleasant as he thought.
Unable to cope with a Sunday afternoon alone, he visits his parents who
are at a neighbour's wine-tasting party. Even they have a life beyond
his expectations.
When all seems lost, he finds a good woman to rescue. Laura's father
dies and she invites Rob to the funeral. Her cry of anguish as the
coffin moves away changes his life. Confronted with mortality, he moves
from feeling anaesthetised from other people's grief to a future that
holds the possibility of adulthood.
There are some wonderfully sharp observations, especially in areas
where Rob would be familiar, the young professionals' dinner parties,
where the unmarried women with empty drinks cupboards and fast cars seem
uncannily accurate.
Most of the observations have a feeling of reportage rather than
creation, and suggest this may be a man's book in the same way that
certain authors used to be classified as women's writers. But Hornby is
rescued by his humanity and his humour. He avoids both romance and
sentimentality to sympathise with the laddish behaviour he exposes,
while simultaneously providing a character who is capable of saving Rob
from himself and delivering a resolutely hopeful, happy ending.

AUTHOR Neil Paterson, who won an Oscar for writing The Room at the Top
screenplay in 1960, has died at a Crieff nursing home after a long
illness. He was 79.
Despite his literary and film achievements, he still considered his
season as captain of Dundee United FC to be his greatest success.
The son of a solicitor, he was born in Greenock and grew up in Banff
before attending Edinburgh University, with the original intention of
following in his father's footsteps.
However, he left to pursue a career in journalism after gaining an MA
and, unable to get a job as a sports reporter, he became a sub-editor
with Thomson-Leng's magazine division in Dundee.
While there, he began to write short stories -- an interest that was
to continue after the Second World War and lead to his connection with
the movie industry.
Mr Paterson married in 1939 and served in the Navy as a lieutenant for
six years, narrowly avoiding death when his ship, the Venessa, was
bombed by the Luftwaffe.
At the end of the war he returned to Scotland and penned his first
novel, The China Run, which helped him win the Atlantic Award for
Literature. His next novel, Behold Thy Daughter, became an international
best-seller and was followed in the 1950s by And Delilah and Man on a
Tight Rope.
His story The Kidnappers published in 1957, was made into a film with
Duncan Macrae and was recently revived with Charlton Heston in the lead
role.
Despite spending time working in Hollywood with screen legends like
Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, Mr Paterson was never tempted to move
from his Crieff home.
In later years, he became involved with the development of film and
the arts and was on the founding boards of Grampian Television and the
National Film School. He was Governor of British Film Institute and on
the boards of Scottish Arts Council, the Arts Council for Great Britain,
and Pitlochry Festival Theatre.
However, it was the 1936-37 football season with Dundee United, when
he became the first amateur in Britain to captain a professional side,
that he remembered most fondly.
Mr Paterson is survived by his wife, Rose, and children, Lynn, Kerr,
and John.

SCOTT Capurro is an amiably waspish comic conversationalist, always
liable to unsettle his audiences by suddenly saying what they least
expect to hear, teasing them with a determined playfulness. His
compulsive brand of stand-up is frank, hugely funny, and distinguished
by a sharp and dangerous edge. Last summer in Edinburgh, all these
attributes earned the rangy San Franciscan a Perrier Fringe Best
Newcomer award.
Yet, as Capurro prepares to rejoin us north of the Border near the end
of what has been a highly successful six-month domicile on this side of
the Atlantic, his reflections on his career are not entirely bathed in
joy. And it's all because of one little word. The word that inevitably
seems to crop up to the exclusion of other, equally valid words whenever
Capurro's singular brand of comedy is placed under the media microscope.
And the word occasioning his rueful ruminations? Gay. Which is what
Capurro is. Of course, his being gay is a fact that cannot be denied --
not that he or anyone else is trying to.
But the vexed issue here is that gay is not the sum total of what
Capurro is. And if it's inevitable that a comedian will end up having an
adjective attached to him, it should always be a word which attests to
that comedian's powers of mirth-induction. So let us hail the hilarious,
chucklesome Scott Capurro.
''I'm well aware that being a gay man is what makes me a unique
property in comedy terms here in the UK,'' Capurro says, grappling with
the paradoxes of his status and keen to stress, too, that he has no
complaints whatsoever about his being homo, or unhetero, or call it what
you will, thank you very much, chuck.
''When I first came to perform in Britain I was told I'd be playing
the alternative comedy circuit, but when I got here everyone up on the
stage seemed to be a straight, white male. And don't get me wrong, a lot
of them are very funny -- but in clubs back home we have black comics;
Chinese comics; gay women comics; me, the queer.
''But I also have to say that gay is a heterosexual concept; it's a
limiting term employed by straight society. If you say a guy is gay,
straight society then knows how he dresses, where he goes. They don't
have to consider him.
''I'd rather simply be thought of as a comedian, but at the same time
I can't dump the gay association. But I have to say that I don't believe
in the notion of a gay community. I don't believe it exists. And I'm
sick of being wanted as a gay spokesman.
''I've actually been cut from a couple of gay TV specials in the
States for 'not being a positive role model'. It's the same kind of
treatment drag queens seem to get in the UK.
''When I started doing stand-up, it was in gay clubs in San Francisco,
and I got a lot of support. But then I started playing in straight
clubs, and without changing my act at all I got encouragement there,
too. You see, I think what I most enjoy about performing is getting a
straight audience squirming. Especially a PC audience, the ones who have
come along to empathise, and show solidarity, and pat the queer on the
head.
''I played a show over here, and I discovered a gay man in the
audience and started asking him intimate questions about his sex life --
and gay men love to talk about the intimacies of their sex lives. And
all of a sudden a woman in the audience shouted 'Enough! Enough!' And in
the same instant I knew that I wanted to make that woman cry.
''Because if I'm going to talk about being gay, I'll talk about sex.
I'm not going to talk about percentages. I'm not going to talk about how
wonderful it is to be gay, and how supportive my lover is. I'll talk
about reality. About the darker reality of being gay.
''Because there are enough people out there, in the mainstream life of
everyday America and in certain Christian cultures, who think we are
evil. Who not only want us to fail in our jobs, but who want us to die,
who see us as burning on earth.
''I played a gig in Watford, and there was a man in the front row with
his girlfriend, and he seemed angry with me right from the beginning. So
I went after him. I toyed with him. I pushed him to the edge. 'Are you
looking for a good slap?' he asked me at one point, as though I wasn't
worth wasting a proper, manly punch on.
''Even as I was pushing him, I was horrified, horrified to the point
of being sexually aroused. And when it was all over, the guy came up to
me and shook my hand.
''But I've stopped pursuing gay causes and gay events, because gay
events are all about affirmation. And that bores me. It's as though they
want to live like some set of bland, happy characters in a seventies TV
family sitcom.''
HAVING abandoned his initial career as an actor -- ''agents,
auditions; it just felt like begging all the time'' -- Capurro thinks it
might be time to resume it, spurred by his enjoyment of a fleeting
silver-screen role in Mrs Doubtfire, as one of Robin Williams's camp
couturiers.
''I was simply hired as a 6ft 2in skinny, I didn't have to take
responsibility for anything. In movies, they feed you. They iron your
clothes. Gay men see your name on film credits and they're impressed,
they ask you to dinner.
''Actually, what I most want to do in my career is mainstream TV
sitcom. As a gay character. Not assimilated. Just there, being seen. The
reason is that I've been on the road around the world for five years
now, and I can see why headline comics become alcoholics and drug
addicts. It's tough, it's a killer.
''With a TV sitcom, you're working in the same city 26 weeks of the
year. You learn your script on Sunday. You film your two episodes a
week. They give you lots of money. They give you a hairdresser. You have
your hair lightened. You buy a house. There's your life.
''Los Angeles? It intimidates me, but it's where I want to be. In LA,
they love you . . . they adore you, but then they never return your
calls. There's a lot of fear in Hollywood. My being honest and open
makes a lot of people shake. They're afraid I'll out them. There are gay
agents who are afraid to be seen talking to me in public. We still have
so much work to do.''
There's not quite such a long way for Britain to go in terms of
accepting gay mores. ''The American thing is usually what I have to
address on stage here first. The American accent, the tone of voice. It
seems to bug people more than anything. Although there was one British
guy I asked to say 'homosexual', and it took me the whole show to get
him to do it.''
Oddly, London's Gay and Lesbian Radio displayed similar reluctance.
They said Capurro was too rude. And he delights in having apparently
picked up a lifetime radio ban from the BBC for having said a rude word
-- eight times -- on the Emma Freud programme.
CAPURRO is sure he will receive a friendlier, less uptight reception
in Scotland. Or at least he hopes so. ''I find Scottish men very
attractive. It's like a straight guy with big tits. I am drawn to
Scotsmen. I can't help but flirt with them.
''Those furrowed brows. So brooding. So self-dismissive . . . Scotsmen
seem to hate themselves. So appealing, all those broken wings! I want to
hug them.''
No. He didn't mean me. I just look glaikit, not brooding. And a
Scottish gay friend confided that while Scotsmen might appear
intriguing, they are less so when you get to know them. But may Capurro
have as much fun looking for Mr McGoodbar as you'll have seeing Capurro
on stage.
* Scott Capurro plays five Scottish gigs on the Gilded Balloon Comedy
Circuit, starting at Paisley's Arts Centre on Wednesday then visiting

KAREN Lewis beat Liz McColgan by 64 seconds when last they raced, over
15,000 metres in Florida eight weeks ago. Some might say Karen had an
advantage. She was in a wheelchair.
A spina bifida victim, 20-year-old Karen is Scotland's most successful
wheelchair athlete. She holds the national title and record in seven
events -- at every distance from 100m to the half-marathon. Tomorrow, in
Turin, she makes her marathon debut, bidding to clock 2hr 45min, the
qualifying time for Britain's Paralympic squad for Atlanta.
Bright, bubbly, and fun-loving, she is as single-minded about
achieving success as McColgan or Linford Christie.
How committed? All the more chillingly by virtue of her matter-of-fact
delivery, she said: ''Drugs? I have my suspicions about some disabled
athletes. We are tested -- we're just as determined to win as any other
sports people, after all. Personally, I would not dream of using drugs,
but if I thought I would get away with it, I'd have my legs amputated.
Wheelchair racing is all about power-to-weight ratio, and my legs are no
use to me at all.
''I'll probably get arthritis in my elbows, hands, and arms when I'm
older, but that's the price you pay to succeed.''
Karen grins with satisfaction as she recalls finishing ahead of
McColgan at the Gasparilla race in Tampa. ''It was a real boost for my
ego. It's amazing what people like Liz and other celebrities get for
racing. She and Yvonne Murray seem to get great sponsorship packages,
worth thousands.
''I do get some help, and am really grateful. But sometimes I feel it
is a sympathy vote, rather than because of what I am as an athlete.''
A member of Glasgow club Red Star, she gets no appearance money,
paying her own way to races. Fortunately, backing from Motorola, Glasgow
District Council, and an East Kilbride company, Altro Floors, has eased
her passage to overseas events.
''In Tampa I won five dollars. I had a bet with my coach, Ian Mirfin,
that I would break 48 minutes. Mind you, he's still to pay up. Maybe
after Turin . . .''
Her ego should require little massaging. Last year Karen won the Great
Scottish, Great Caledonian, Great Midland, and Great Welsh runs,
Aberdeen road mile, Glasgow 10,000m, and Portsmouth half-marathon, plus
all the Scottish track titles.
She began her sports career as a swimmer, coached by her mum,
Christine. At the World Youth Games in Miami six years ago she won gold
in her class at 50m back-stroke and breast-stroke. ''I was asked to make
up a team in the wheelchair relay, and that was me hooked. I got a
racing chair as soon as I returned.''
Now her chair is #2000 worth of high tech, plus a further #1000 for
the wheels, with special aerodynamic spokes which have flat leading
edges, not round.
Although able-bodied athletes have three places per athletics event,
Britain offers only four Olympic wheelchair places for women -- but 12
for men. ''Yes, I do feel women are discriminated against,'' she said.
''To have a chance of a place in the endurance events, my best
distances, I have to get into the sprint relay squad. It's a bit like
telling an able-bodied athlete he can only run the Olympic marathon if
he is good enough to run the sprint relay. It does seem unfair.''
Especially with Britain having set the Olympic standard at last year's
world bronze-medal performance, because the UK boasts world 100m
champion, Tani Gray, and bronze medallist, Tracy Lewis.
But Karen is confident she will make it, and Turin tomorrow will be
the key if she breaks 2-45.
Preparation is scientific and precise. Crewe and Alsager University
have a human performance laboratory for disabled sport, where Karen
prepared for Tampa in a chamber simulating 90% humidity and 82 degree
heat.
But she cuts corners to save money. Instead of special gloves costing
#80 to protect her hands from blistering, Karen makes her own. ''I use a
pair of goalie gloves, inside weight-lifting gloves, and bind them with
surgical tape.''
You can tell when she is training hard. The lounge ceiling of the
family home in Carluke vibrates with a thunderous rumble. She has a
roller contraption which allows her to power along for miles without
leaving the spare bedroom.
Which is just as well. Karen is as much at home behind the wheel of
her Vauxhall Astra as she is behind the steering bar of her racing
chair. She purchased it under the Government Motability scheme, but is
restricted to a maximum of 12,000 miles per year. Penalties are payable
at an escalating rate above this distance. One Glasgow youngster
recently logged up an extra 4000 miles, could not pay the excess, and
had his car repossessed.
''I race a lot down south, but have to travel by train or plane,''
said Karen, who is on benefit. ''I can't afford high car mileage. Three
weekly training trips to Glasgow virtually wipes out one fifty-second of
the 12,000 miles. Motability is great. You get assistance to purchase
the vehicle, free insurance, and road tax, but it is supposed to give
you freedom of movement. It doesn't leave me much freedom to be an
athlete.
''I left Carluke High with five O grades, and tried for two years to
get a job. I had just one interview. I've watched people from my old
class, with nothing like my qualifications, get jobs. It can be
frustrating, but I am certainly not bitter. I am a full-time athlete
now. Sport has made my life wonderful. I've done things they will never
do and been to places they will never see.''

THE former bodyguard of the ''Glasgow Godfather'' Arthur Thomson, who
claimed he was framed on an armed robbery charge, was jailed for 12
years at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday.
The jury took just 30 minutes to find Thomas Bagan, 39, and his two
co-accused guilty of hi-jacking a security van and robbing three guards
of #283,000 at gunpoint.
Bagan, of Station Road, Blantyre, was also found guilty of stealing a
taxi and pointing a handgun at a policeman to avoid arrest.
Temporary Judge Alexander Wilkinson, QC, who was told Bagan had been
jailed for eight years in 1977 on two charges of attempted murder, told
the accused: ''You have a bad record for serious crimes of violence.''
The judge jailed Gordon McLeod, 39, of Jacks Road, Uddingston, and
James Scougal, 33, of Angus Walk, Viewpark, for eight years each.
Mr James Scott, prosecuting, told the court that McLeod and Scougal
also had previous convictions ''but they were not in the same league as
Bagan''.
During the trial the court was told how the raid in Motherwell, on
September 19 last, turned into a shambles.
Security guard Robert McCulloch, 34, said he and colleagues were
threatened by a masked man with a sawn-off shotgun outside the Bank of
Scotland in Brandon Parade South.
The raiders began throwing sacks of money into a red Rover car.
''I reversed and rammed the front of the car,'' he said.
The robbers then began putting the money bags into a white van which,
Mr McCulloch said, he also rammed.
As Bagan and the others tried to escape, police began following them.
Bagan hi-jacked a taxi, picked up the other raiders, and they tried to
make their getaway.
However, they were trapped by police and Bagan, still masked, told one
officer: ''This is explainable,'' and lay face down in a garden while
another policeman sat on him.
Police arrested the others within minutes and recovered all the cash,
along with the sawn-off shotgun and handgun. Both weapons were loaded.
In a special defence of incrimination, Bagan blamed three other men
for the robbery and named them as Mr Thomas McGraw, Mr Paul Ferris, and
Mr Donald McMillan.
Bagan told his solicitor, Mr Michael McSherry, that he was at one time
bodyguard for the late Mr Arthur Thompson, whom he described as the
Godfather of crime in Glasgow.
But he was pursuaded to team up with Mr McGraw, whom he claimed wanted
to take over from Mr Thompson.
Bagan said there was a power struggle for control of crime in Glasgow.
During this, he claimed, Mr Thompson twice confronted him armed with a
gun. The first time the gun went off and the bullet struck Mr Thompson's
groin. The second time he managed to escape.
Bagan said that three weeks before the raid, a newspaper reporter told
him he was on a hit list and was going to be killed. It was as a result
of a story he gave the newspaper that he was set up to take the blame
for the robbery.
He had told the court that Mr Ferris asked to borrow a white van that
he and the co-accused used for their double glazing business. He was
also told Mr Ferris wanted to meet him at 3pm at a tower block in
Motherwell on the day of the raid.
Bagan said he, McLeod, and Scougal waited and saw Mr Ferris and Mr
McMillan arrive in the white van and then drive off in a car.
He and the co-accused got into the van, but shortly after they drove
off he noticed a shotgun in the back and a number of sacks and realised
he had been ''framed''.
Bagan said he put on a mask which was in the car and tried to run when
the van stopped in Bellshill.
He agreed he stole the taxi in Bellshill, but denied threatening the
driver with a pistol or pointing the gun at a policeman.
Another witness, Detective Inspector Derek Ingram, 4l, also told how a
contract was put out on his life, and that of other officers.
The detective said that the man who wanted him dead was Mr Paul
Ferris, and the reason for the contract was revenge over an arrest he
had made.
Mr Ingram also claimed that Mr Ferris tried to set him up on a faked
drugs charge in 1986, but this failed.
The court was told that efforts to trace Mr Ferris and Mr McGraw, to
bring them to court to give evidence, had failed.

A NEW FBI-style unit is being set up in Britain to track down serial
killers.
The National Crime Faculty is being developed by Detective Chief
Superintendent Phil Pyke, 44, of Devon and Cornwall Police, who called
on FBI expertise during the hunt for the man who raped and killed
22-year-old Sandra Parkinson, from Ayrshire, when she was working as a
chambermaid in Devon last July.
Mr Pyke said the faculty, based at the Police College, Bramshill,
Hampshire, would provide expertise and skills-support for police
investigating serial and serious crimes.
It may form links with the FBI and European police forces.
He said the faculty was ''exactly the same as the Behavioural Science
Unit at the FBI'' -- which helped inspire the film The Silence of the
Lambs.
The faculty's operational arm will deal with offender profiling and
crime-scene assessment to give ''in the field'' support to senior
officers on major investigations.
A support arm will carry out research into offences, and provide
national CID training.
The faculty will collate information already held on crimes such as
rapes and serial killings.
Following the suicide of Sandra Parkinson's killer, 32-year-old Alan
Conner -- linked forensically to one of two other rapes -- the Devon
force pioneered the setting up of a national DNA database.

<HEADLINE>Dounreay fuel manufactured at A-bomb factory</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978763948</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PLUTONIUM fuel for the Dounreay nuclear complex was made at the A-bomb
factory at Aldermaston in Berkshire, it was disclosed yesterday.
The involvement by the Atomic Weapons Establishment in making
fuel-rods for the Scottish facility has emerged in an official
Government report written by the Advisory Committee on the Safety of
Nuclear Installations (ACSNI), a group which advises the Health and
Safety Commission.
Earlier this week, Greenpeace alleged that plutonium from Sellafield
was used to make British A- and H-bombs. Sellafield's plutonium stock
includes material from Dounreay's now-closed Prototype Fast Reactor.
In the past, Dounreay's management has denied any links with Britain's
military programme, stating it was ''absolute rubbish'' to suggest any
of their plutonium was used for making nuclear weapons.
Until now, it had always been officially stated that the plutonium
fuel used in Dounreay's main reactor had either been made at Sellafield,
or in France.
However, the ACSNI report makes it clear the Weapons Establishment at
Aldermaston had an important role to play.
The study states that a plant to provide fuel for Dounreay's PFR,
which closed a year ago, was specially set up at Aldermaston at a time
when it came under the same UK Atomic Energy Authority management as
Dounreay.
The Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston is now operated by
private-sector consortium, Hunting-BRAE.
Yesterday, a Dounreay spokesman admitted that some ''experimental''
fuel for Dounreay's Prototype Fast Reactor was made at the Aldermaston
A-bomb factory.
He said that the facility at Aldermaston for making the Dounreay fuel
would soon be decommissioned by a contractor acceptable to both the
Atomic Weapons Establishment there and to the UK Atomic Energy
Authority, Dounreay's main operators.
He added that the Aldermaston facility was used during the late 60s
and early 70s to make fuel for Dounreay ''because of an overload of work
here and spare capacity at Aldermaston''.
He said the Aldermaston fuel-making facility ''had nothing to do with
weapons work there''.

Beneath the serviceable tweed hacking jackets and other manifestations
of the country-set class, all may not be quite what it would seem in the
world of Perth's douce ladies. Anne Simpson discovers a current of
unrest, albeit slightly subdued, as the historic city prepares to elect
a successor to its flamboyant MP, the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn
SEEN from the river bank, just beyond that point where Prince Albert
is turning his sandstone back on the Tay, two Perthshire ladies are
walking their dogs, one an Aberdeen terrier, the other a King Charles.
The women look like sitters on committees, fine, fluffy white hair cut
well enough to need only minimal attention. Serviceable tweeds hang
loosely against their rangy figures, and spectacles on cords lodge on
that shelf formed by breast. Around each neck there is also that
tasteful religious relic of class, a single strand of small, unblemished
pearls.
It is a day of milky sunshine, but the air is sharp enough for the
pair to adhere to their body-warmers. Often seen on the backs of anglers
and army foot patrols, these padded gilets fit over the ladies' hacking
jackets like khaki cosies, giving an overwhelming impression of no
nonsense. In their 60s, perhaps, keen and invigorating in conservative
dress, they are surely Tory matriarchs, the upright backbone of the
Party, so good with sandwiches and cakes and all the genteel bric-a-brac
of fund-raising tombolas.
Yet much is not what it seems in Perthshire. An approachable place,
the people reserved but friendly, we strike up an exchange about the
weather, shifting gravely on to another kind of whether; the condition
of the Tory vote. As it happens, both ladies -- Perth remains a town
where women are ladies rather than the more contemporary way round --
are members of the Conservative Club, but neither is too overjoyed at
the way the Party has been conducting its business.
''I cannot say I am enchanted with its performance,'' one says.
''People are still not able to face the future securely. My
grandchildren are without jobs, and, quite frankly, much of the
Conservative politicians' personal behaviour lately has been what we, in
my day, would call bad form.''
If this pervading whiff of sleaze continues, this lady, for one, may
plant her vote elsewhere. ''I'd never give my allegiance to Labour, but
if there was a good, old-fashioned Liberal Party left in this country
then I think I would support them. The SDP means well, but there's not
much to them, is there? As for the Nationalists, my feeling is they are
a little too strident for Perth.''
Serene contentment is not written on the face of her companion,
either. ''We met the new Conservative candidate for the late Sir
Nicholas's seat, and he is a very charming person but . . . well,
perhaps Nicholas Fairbairn was somewhat too flamboyant. However, this
latest gentleman, very nice as I have mentioned, doesn't seem to know
quite what to say.''
Still, it is early days, she concedes, in by-election terms, but even
if John Godfrey's Tory performance remains lacklustre at the hustings,
her vote on the big day will be his. ''I have supported the
Conservatives all my life, and just because this lot are disappointing I
am not going to change. Maybe that is foolish, but that is the way it
is.'' Hardly a revolutionary; but then, some people from the day they
are born grow up to be their parents, their father and mother's voting
preference inherited like flat feet.
We have reached that moment in the afternoon when the tea ritual takes
hold, and the teeming river walk is suddenly thinning out accordingly.
In the shelter of some ornamental shrubs placed in a tall, octagonal
container, two more ladies of Perth -- who might elsewhere be called
wifies -- are setting up the props of a modest picnic: flasks and
plastic beakers, two Scotch pies, a packet of chocolate-coated Hobnobs.
They are wearing Thora Hird overcoats and knitted jellybag hats, and one
is saying: ''So now he's off to Glasgow to get his hernia done.''
Looking down on them from the left is a sign at the side of the
Perthshire Fieldsports building, insisting on No Parking, its futility
summed up in peeling paint.
EMBOLDENED by the sprightly air, we approach. ''Excuse me, but if
there were a General Election tomorrow, or the by-election for Perth and
Kinross were to be held next week, how would you vote?'' The two ladies,
cheeks packed like those of hungry squirrels, exchange disgusted looks.
''Put it this way,'' says the one in the plum-coloured jellybag,
answering for both. ''We'd not give the vote to any of them; they're no'
but a bag of rogues.''
But such comment is an aberration, surely, for more than anything
Perthshire is the territory of guardians of tradition, its farming
landscape so groomed and perfectly cultivated it might have been put
together by a master tailor. Approaching the town from Glasgow, and just
at that point where the grander villas begin, there is a street called
Needless Road, a name that, given the saunter of Perth's traffic, sounds
like middle-class tut-tutting. Classes for patchwork quilting and
applique hang in a library window. Inside, two women at the counter are
chatting.
''My daughter's got that job,'' says the younger one. ''Excellent. I'm
thrilled for her,'' says the second. ''Yes, but she's not sure if she
should take it. She says she was always educated at state schools
herself, and teaching in a private school, well, she might not feel
quite right.'' Her face charged on impatience, the older woman replies:
''Och, Jeanie, she shouldn't be so silly. Wherever they are, they're all
pupils but now she'll get less cheek.''
On Methven Street there is a Cat Shelter shop and round the corner, up
towards the old end of the High Street, there is Montgomery, the
''better baker'' who, despite his best efforts, finds no palate for
croissants in Perth, but in his haggis bridie has discovered a golden
egg. A third-generation baker, he draws clients from all over, one
landed gentlewoman arriving every fortnight in a chauffeured Rolls to
collect her order of two dozen crumpets.
Back in the centre of town, inside a rather aristocratic wine shop, a
notably chic lady with smooth, chignoned hair considers that, with house
parties approaching, the political state of the nation is the last
consideration of the female mind. ''But since you ask, I'll give my vote
to Labour. Always have done, actually. Not that I like them
particularly, but I vote according to that persuasion simply to honour
the suffragettes.''
Old-fashioned reserve, she says, demands she remains anonymous, but
this is the way of much personal opinion in Perth. Not shy, not timid,
but a rather buttoned-up enigma, the Perthshire lady is too shrewd to be
predictable, yet one suspects that beneath the refined plumage there
lies a core of stainless steel.
Speaking from her local hairdresser's, moments before committing her
tawny head to the dryer, Baroness Strange reflects that any lack of
political urgency about the ladies of Perthshire just now might be
because we live in an age where people are preoccupied with their own
thing. Nevertheless, she certainly believes her fellow countywomen are
highly competent and quietly influential.
Cherry Strange would never admit as much, but she herself admirably
demonstrates her argument: mother of six children, conscientious member
of the Lords, author of romantic fiction (Love From Belinda; Lalage in
Love) and the wife of a man who assumed her maiden name of Drummond by
decree of the Lord Lyon when she inherited the family seat, Megginch
Castle in Errol.
''I do rather think you'll find most Perthshire ladies are good
cooks,'' she says. ''And they spend quite a lot of time caring for their
homes and looking after their husbands. Also they tend to be very keen
gardeners.'' And does class matter any longer in modern Scotland? ''I
see us as an extremely well-ordered country where anyone can get to the
top from wherever they start out. But yes, of course, there is a class
structure here as there is for any form of life . . . Hens have one. So
do dogs and pigs. The thing is we in Scotland have an endemic sense of
belonging which makes everyone part of the band.''
Saturday morning is the time to observe the gentry shopping at
Ellery's, the only high-toned delicatessen left in Perth. From Fife and
Inverness-shire they come, the mother of the Princess of Wales included
in their number. Christine Blair, one of the partners, reflects:
''Sometimes you can hardly move in here for old money going through its
grocery list. The gentlemen certainly know their cheeses, while their
wives go for the rough pates, dips and sauces, and the tray bakes. They
like their millionaire's shortbread.''
Later, when the season really gets going, Ellery's clientele may order
exclusive venison casseroles and pies, and fresh fruit to supplement its
own choice catering. ''I must say they are very pleasant people,
well-mannered and all Tories of course, but it is interesting how many
of their children are swinging to the SNP.''
At the back of Ellery's in Skinnergate there is a rare splash of Perth
graffiti damning IRA sluts and Dundee basterds (sic). Other words have
been edited out with whitewash daubs, as if the author were suddenly
keen to tighten up his prose. But the crude, hard, slap of muralled
cursing is a world away from the tweeded lady leaning on her
silver-topped cane beside McEwan's perfumery department. ''Is there a
tolerable chance,'' she asks, ''of your stocking Penhaligon's Hungary
Water?'' She has one of those voices that makes shop assistants stand to
attention. But as far as her purchase is concerned, she is out of luck.
No Hungary Water, no Penhaligon's, and she is scarcely the type to
settle for mere eau-de-Cologne.
THERE is an ancient photograph in Perth's Museum depicting a Miss
Ballantine who, in 1922, broke the fishing record for the Tay by
catching a salmon of 64lb in Glen Delvine Water. That record still
stands, and in the picture the fish lies at Miss Ballantine's feet like
a massive, slithery stone prised from a causeway. She, meanwhile, holds
her heavy Malloch rod in one hand, like a staff. The other hand is
plunged purposefully into her jacket pocket. The only frivolity about
Miss Ballantine's person is an incongruous pom-pom dangling from an
ungainly angler's hat.
But there is something familiar about that suit. We saw it first thing
this morning, then at lunchtime, and in the afternoon, a changeless
two-piece, thorn-proof and bracken-coloured for a certain one-ness with
the hills. A fashion without fashion, totally subordinate to its wearer
and still, in 1995, just the right cover for the Perthshire lady.
Yet nothing may be what it seems. Down by the river bank this day of
full sunlight is slipping into haze, and as we pass again the statue of
the Prince Consort we note for the first time that weathering has made
off with the first two letters of his name. There, in his mutton chops
and ceremonial rompers stands Bert . . . Or is a Perthshire mist playing
tricks?

THE first time I saw Bucharest was when Scotland, Grand Slam champions
no less, went to Romania for a two-week tour in 1984.
For most of us, it was the longest fortnight of our lives.
Those were the days when Communism still held sway, the Secret Police
ruled with an iron fist and a party line on the phone meant you had
company on every call.
Western journalists were about as welcome as a plague of locusts.
Even achieving a telephone call to the United Kingdom was a matter
worth reporting.
A connection would take at least an hour, when the call came through
it was routed to a room other than the one you were occupying.
The Scottish press corps huddled in corners, then ran in the general
direction of the ringing noise.
For the players, food was the major concern.
Like there was not very much of it and what there was was lousy.
There were, however, five-page menus.
You could indicate what you might like to savour, and the helpful
waiter would tell you it was off.
''I could eat,'' declared one of our forwards who was slimming before
our very eyes, ''an old horse.''
''Not available,'' insisted the waiter with not a flicker of a smile.
We quickly discovered that money, or at least the Romanian version of
it, was not worth the paper it was printed upon.
Wisely, the locals refused to accept their own currency for anything
worthwhile.
Most useful, however, were Mars bars and ladies' tights in which we
all travelled, so to speak.
I had five shirts laundered for four bars and one pair, and I was sure
the chambermaid went off to open a shop.
With the Scottish party was a small, if eccentric, band of supporters.
After one of them had consumed a bottle or so of the local firewater,
he found himself locked out at 11 o'clock at night.
He banged on the front door, threatened the management with all kinds
of legal action before he discovered he was attempting to gain entry,
not to his hotel, but to the security headquarters.
His release followed a feed of Mars bars to the police dogs.
After some time in Bucharest, we flew to the Black Sea resort of
Mamia.
When we arrived, in a plane where seat-belts were not available to
every passenger, it was pouring rain and there was no-one to hump the
baggage.
''It could be worse,'' contemplated the great Hawick sage Jim Renwick,
''we could be in Gala.''
The rugby? We won the warm-up games and lost the Test match, which was
played in a heat-wave.
Our captain Jim Aitken was concussed; it was his, and Renwick's last
international.
By that time we were just longing to go home.
''We have just left Romanian air space,'' announced the captain on the
Swiss-Air flight and a mighty roar went up.
We all welcome the Romanians.
We hope things have improved dramatically in your country.
But I am still not ready for another run at downtown Bucharest.

NATIONAL Farm Walk Week will be run from June 2 -- 11 when farmers
will be asked to open their gates and show local communities in Scotland
how they are managing their land.
Scottish development officer for the Farming and Wildlife Advisory
Group, Judith Darmady, said: ''We tend only to hear the bad news about
what is happening on farms. The fact is that many farmers have a very
sensitive approach to their business and are doing a great deal to
improve wildlife habitats. Farm Walk Week gives farmers the opportunity
to show their local community the steps they are taking not only to
produce healthy food for use but also to show how they are caring for
the countryside.''
FWAG Scotland, based at Ingliston, near Edinburgh, will provide
information packs to farmers wishing to organise a walk.

THE gap between the understanding of the agricultural industry and
consumers is so great that according to one of Scotland's leading
agricultural scientists, Dr John Oldham, who is head of Genetics and
Behavioural Sciences with the Scottish Agricultural College, that there
is a fair chance one day soon that a young child might say: ''Hey mum, I
found a cows nest!''
That was the title of a lecture given by Dr Oldham when he received
the Saltire Society and Royal Bank of Scotland Science Award during the
recent Edinburgh Science Festival.
The heading may have sounded a shade frivolous but speaking yesterday,
Dr Oldham explained: ''There are so few people now directly involved in
agriculture that the general public has very little idea of what
actually happens down on the farm. It is a real problem for the industry
and one that has to be faced.''
Modern dairy genetics are Dr Oldham's speciality and he reckons that
farmers need to be particularly careful in their future breeding policy.
He is also concerned at the public perception within the developed world
towards dairy products.
As a result of various claims milk and dairy products are now linked
with all sorts of health problems. The result is that production in the
western world is now falling, whereas in the third world production is
rising because milk is seen as being high in protein and a throroughly
nutritious food product.
Taking a parallel with Charles Dickens, Dr Oldham added: ''We in
Europe have a sort of inverted Micawberism in that because we have too
much food we are unhappy, yet there are so many starving people in the
rest of the world. We have to get the balance right.''
Dr Oldham is closely involved with Edinburgh University's Langhill
Farm, near Roslin on the edge of the city, and it is there that for many
years he has been working on the breeding of what he believes to be the
best type of modern black-and-white cow.
The success of that project is recognised internationally and the herd
is officially related as one of the top genetic units in the UK.
Speaking of the herd, he said: ''We must have selection goals and we
have to take account of the cow's ability to consume feed, especially
forage. There is a danger that we may get to the stage where we have
cows which are in theory capable of producing a great deal of milk but
which physically just cannot eat enough to match that potential.''
Dr Oldham is convinced that regardless of which system of farming is
pursued a high potential cow is the only true option. ''A genetically
superior cow is the best bet even in a low-input system. From both a
husbandry and environmental point of view we are better off with fewer
but better cows -- for a start less cows mean less slurry.''
Welfare is increasingly important on the priority list at Langhill.
''The strategy has to be to match the cow with the system and to select
accordingly. We have not found that to be a problem. Our cows are fit,
produce a lot of milk and breed regularly.''
Looking into the future, Dr Oldham concluded: ''It looks as though we
will be selecting cows which are willing to milk and are able to
mobilise extra body tissue to do that. It's quite normal to do this but
we will not push it too far as we continue to select for cows which have
that ability to eat extra food. If they do that they will realise their
full potential and be profitable.''

<HEADLINE>Government money needed to back VMD as excellence centre</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN could become a centre of excellence for testing and approval
of animal medicines, it was claimed yesterday. But some pump-priming
money from government would be needed.
This would follow from the creation of the government's Veterinary
Medicine Directorate, which is responsible for licensing medicines in
Britain, and the setting up of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency
in London.
Peter Coe, the new chairman of the National Office of Animal Health
which represents leading manufacturers, has called on agriculture
minister William Waldegrave to back the industry's appeal to the
Treasury for short-term cash aid for the VMD to attract inward
investment.
He warned that failure to do so could result in reduced animal
medicines research in the UK. In 1993 an estimated #40m was spent in
this area by the industry. The 61 companies associated with NOAH had
combined sales of more than #280m last year.
Speaking at a London news conference he said that the presence of both
the EMEA and the VMD in Britain could act as a magnet drawing companies
and work to Britain.
''There is a great opportunity for the VMD to attract work as
rapporteur and as first licenser in the decentralised system. However,
its resources are clearly under stress and must be strengthened if it is
to attract the international business.''
Success in this area would lead to more international companies
utilising UK science-based institutions to carry out the trials and
research needed to produce licensing data.

IT was a remark from a colleague that set me thinking. ''You've not
been in the office much recently and people have noticed it,'' he
observed. ''Have you really got your finger on the pulse?''
Fair question. I have been on the road a lot these last few months,
trying to boost fresh business and generate more awareness of our
company's new image and its broader product range. There has also been a
constant search for those elusive star recruits for the management team,
an issue which absorbs astonishing amounts of time.
So, how long can a MD safely spend away from the business without
affecting its operations, or giving the impression to staff that they
have been left to soldier on alone and unloved? The obvious first answer
is that it depends on the type of business and its management structure.
There are industry sectors where a MD's job is very definitely
hands-on, leading the team by example and always available to sort out
problems. Then there are companies run by autocrats who insist, whether
from insecurity or a genuine belief in their own abilities, that every
tiny decision lands on their desk.
And there are those with modern, devolved management structures where
clear definition of roles and responsibilities ensures everyday matters
are dealt with by the people directly concerned. The MD concentrates on
strategic issues and stays firmly out of the engine room.
I guess we are halfway towards the latter state, and striving to
progress as rapidly as possible in that direction. There is still a lot
of engine room stuff that ends up on my plate, and some of it will
remain there for the foreseeable future because of the size and nature
of our business and the part my particular skills play in it.
But I am very clear that rapid growth will only occur once a team of
the right people are in full flight, properly empowered to achieve
precise objectives in the context of an ambitious vision for the
company. It all takes time, inevitably much longer than you first think.
And in the meantime the revenues have still to be won and the
organisation kept focused on the market.
What I am really saying is that while every MD's job involves
balancing numerous priorities and pressures, that of the person trying
to grow a business quite quickly and profitably involves making harder
decisions about such issues. Often responsibility has to be thrust down
into the organisation before people are really ready, so that, for
example, a new business drive continues unabated.
Yet in these days of cheap mobile communications there is little to
stop even a hands-on MD spending a reasonable chunk of the week out of
the office. But what is a reasonable chunk?
I am currently out and about for probably 30% of the average week,
occasionally for more, and reckon this is the maximum I can reasonably
afford at present. Nearer 25% is perhaps a better target to aim for long
term.
I know MDs whose companies appear to run like a sewing machine and
turn in sickeningly good profits, yet they are always there at the
events you happen to attend. Are they just incredibly well organised?
Are they really only nominal MDs and back at base some poor chief
executive or FD is slogging away to make it all happen for them? Or
maybe they have strong management teams and good systems to ensure the
business runs itself on a day-to-day basis no matter how complex it may
be.
As time goes on I become an ever stronger believer in the need to
remain partly detached from the routine operations of your business, so
you have a broad perspective on your marketplace, the competition and
general business trends. There is simply no other way to maintain a
realistic long-term vision for the company or to identify the next deal
but one before it appears over the horizon.
I'm also an adherent of consistent networking with the right people in
the right sectors. There is no substitute for being able to lift the
phone to someone you may have met only once but who is in a key position
to advise you or to provide the necessary contact.
That is not to say you should not be aware of how your business
operates in considerable depth. You must be capable of getting stuck
back into quite fine issues should a crisis arise. But that is a long
way from actually handling those issues routinely: no business will ever
grow properly while its leading lights are obsessed by minutiae.
Well, must go. I've got the cups to wash and the pens to count. It's
tough at the top.

VIRTUAL reality has application in the real world. The technologies
involved may, for some years now, have been looked on only in the
context of vastly expensive military simulators or, alternatively, of
sophisticated arcade games.
''In fact,'' says Dr Arkady Retik, ''today's computers and virtual
reality tools have now reached a level where the technology can
effectively be used by engineering professionals, at a cost they can
afford. It is not a game; it is a practical tool which deals in real
solutions. That is what we are dealing with.''
In Strathclyde University's department of civil engineering, the
division of construction management has been looking at virtual reality
(VR) for some time now. Dr Retik takes a particular interest in this
aspect of its work.
Originally from Minsk in Byelorussia, he took his first degree in
Israel, did his army service, had five years in industry and went on to
complete his masters degree and his doctorate. Coming to Strathclyde was
a good move, he considers, as it means he can pursue his interest in
computer graphics, using powerful programmes with very practical
applications.
He speaks four languages, with the computer as a universal form of
communication. Seeing and interpreting visual information with our
in-built natural computer is, he considers, a basic survival capability.
It points to the importance of the man-made computer as a tool to help
human beings survive in the world of today.
He sees VR as a communications medium, and points to the similarity of
this virtual world and believing we speak to someone on the telephone
when, in reality, we speak to an electronic interpretation of a voice.
''We can take VR as an interface between humans and computers, or the
place where human beings and computers make contact,'' he points out.
''One of the problems, in fact, is this interface. The flat computer
screen is a very unnatural way for human beings to work. Virtual reality
helps to break this glass barrier. We can create a complete environment
that responds interactively to the user and is controlled by the
behaviour of the user.''
What it means in simple terms, he adds, is that we can create a
kitchen design on a screen, turn on the taps, open the cupboards, try
out different textures and decorations. Adding attributes such as
gravity, friction, motion and so on is simply an extension of this
situation.
''Push a virtual glass off the edge of a virtual table and it really
breaks,'' he explains. ''You see it happen. You can be immersed in a VR
system, probably wearing a headset and special gloves. You are inside
that virtual world. You can interact with the space involved. Or you can
look at your virtual world, from the outside, from a variety of angles
and aspects, manipulating the virtual environment that is there.''
It is relatively straightforward, he points out. Not too far removed
from the invention of three-dimensional perspective in the 1400s, or the
creation of a 360-degree panorama of Edinburgh by the late 18th century.
Three-dimensional television had been demonstrated by Strathclyde
graduate John Logie Baird by the thirties. Then came Cinerama and
Sensorama, with the terms cyberspace and virtual reality appearing in
the eighties.
''It is all a matter of progress. Look at the application of VR to
engineering today,'' he suggests. ''It could be very important for the
architect who wants to check out a design, even to touch it; to show
people what it will be like before it is built. It can be very useful
for a surgeon to get experience in operations, without shedding a drop
of real blood. That is an important matter for us all. It can be used,
obviously, in training. You could even, I suppose, end up with virtual
lectures at university and virtual students. Perhaps not too soon,
though.''
What those at Strathclyde are doing is to look at virtual construction
sites, examining ways to use them to improve planning and scheduling.
The created world has simply to be real enough for the user or viewer to
suspend disbelief for a period of time. Using ''primitives'', or
simplified shapes, creates a computer generated world which can be
acceptable as a viable one.
''We are dealing in enhanced computer graphics and advanced
technologies,'' says Dr Retik. ''It is about making steady progress, not
a quantum leap forward. You want to refurbish some houses? Why not ask
the tenants what they want -- let them see the differ ent possibilities
for themselves. Surely that will help to reduce any complaints.
''In terms of building, no software available will show the process of
construction of a project. Yet a contractor has to make out a schedule,
perhaps from hundreds of different drawings.
''What we do is help him to make an optimum choice of methodology, in
terms of time and budget. He can check out all the variables. Do all the
what-if scenarios. Using VR can save chaos on a building site or in an
office. You can run a simulation backwards or forwards, jump to any
point in time, investigate what is going on; look at a site from the
crane operator's point of view; look for the storage space available for
the material supplier.
''We can send the information, the image, by fax or electronic mail to
whoever needs it. We can compare budget and actual time, and cost.
Perhaps we could have saved some of the problems with the Channel
Tunnel. Who knows, we weren't asked.''
Improving ways of communicating and exchanging information, improving
technologies and testing out ideas are all important aspects of academic
work, he maintains. But in the modern scenario, this research also has
to relate to the real world outside. Getting a Carnegie Trust research
grant helps to keep it going. Persuading the Science Engineering
Research Council of the need for the work is also important.
''I suppose we are doing some unique work,'' he concedes. ''We are
recognised as the only group in a civil engineering department in the UK
dealing with construction management. It is different from
three-dimensional work. That way you cannot communicate with the picture
or be part of it. In VR, you can open the cupboard door for yourself,
watch the crane move about on the site, attach intelligent behaviour and
interaction as you choose. You can be part of the experiment if you
wish.
''It is still the practical man who makes the necessary decisions on
what to do in a given situation, of course. This way, it gives him more
confidence and cuts down his business risk. And a picture tells him the
story better than just words. Visually, we can grasp information in
seconds. There is a very strong ability to see information in a picture.
It is what people say about all sorts of situations: 'Don't tell me:
show me'. That is virtual reality.''
The concept of VR is already being applied in day-to-day use. Scottish
Nuclear has invested #100,000 in a VR and simulation computer package.
It allows practice in fuel handling operations at its Torness plant, on
a screen, in a VR world, or viewing plant and equipment that might not
be physically possible in real life. It also covers a range of what-if
scenarios, all from the safety of a VR computer screen.
Virtual reality has now reached a level where the technology can
effectively be used by engineering professionals, at a cost they can
afford. It is not a game; it is a practical tool

SUNNY day/ Everything's A-okay/ On my way/ To where the air is sweet/
Can you tell me how to get/ How to get to Sesame Street?
IF THAT blithe lyric rings a bell, you're probably either under six
years old, the parent of someone who is, or a devout afternoon-TV sofa
surfer like me. For me, the daily doings of Kermit, Big Bird and Cookie
Monster and all their pals: human, Muppet and abstract (as in Today's
show was brought to you by the letters A and G and the number 5) are a
hippie-kindergarten idyll. Multi-ethnic, non-competitive,
anti-consumerist, strictly non-violent, and very strong on values like
sharing, friendship, and looking out for each other, Sesame Street is --
barring that ideal address A World Of My Own -- where I want to live.
And before you tap your forehead and smile pityingly, let me tell you
that I have it on good authority (ie the PR firm who set up this meeting
with Sesame Streeters Elmo and Count Von Count) that Sesame Street is
real. This is from the official interview protocol:
Elmo and Count Von Count are not TV stars, but simply residents of
Sesame Street. There must be no questions concerning the show Sesame
Street, because . . . there is no show, simply an address. The multitude
of stars who have appeared on the show . . . have merely visited Sesame
Street and NOT appeared on any TV show.
So there. See? I told you.
Armed with this reassurance, I step out of Green Park tube station on
a Tuesday morning made for ducks and start looking for that corner of a
London field that is, for this afternoon, Sesame Street. Twenty minutes
later I have visited every street in Knightsbridge except the one I
want, and I am wetter than the day after the end of Prohibition,
standing under an awning thumbing a sodden A-Z, when a nice, middle-aged
London bobby comes up to me and says, very pleasantly, ''Are you looking
for somewhere, sir?''
And without really thinking about it very much I give him what is
meant to be a winning smile and say ''Yes, officer. Can you tell me how
to get to Sesame Street?''
A blimey-we've-got-a-right-one-here look spreads from the peak of his
helmet to his chinstrap and he says: ''Come again, sir?''
''Sorry. Duke's Hotel, St James's Place.''
''What was it you said first, sir?''
''Um . . . Sesame Street. You know, the children's show, like The
Muppets? I'm interviewing Count Von Count and Elmo, and I was thinking
about that when you asked me, so I said . . . ''
''I see, sir. Are you driving, sir, by any chance?''
''No. Don't drive.'' What am I going to do if he asks me to prove it?
''I see, sir. Duke's Hotel is down there, sir,'' he says, leading me
two steps to the corner and pointing to a door 20 yards away.
''Thanks very much.''
As I turn into the hotel -- the small but elegant kind of joint where
guilty millionaires get murdered in Agatha Christie novels -- I look
back up the street, and London's finest is watching me with a thoughtful
expression on his face. Let me into Sesame Street. This world is not my
home.
* * *
WELL, they really are here: Elmo -- he's the little pink one with the
stringy arms and legs, the curious, innocent kid with whom the
pre-schoolers are meant to identify -- and Count Von Count, the Bela
Lugosi lookalike who makes arithmetic fun by . . . um, counting
everything.
Done a lot of interviews today, Count?
''Oh yes! Vun journalist -- ha! ha! Two journalists -- ha! ha! Tree
journalists -- ha! ha!'' (und so weiter, as they say on Sesamstrasse).
And where did you get that accent? Transylvania?
''No -- Pennsylvania, ha! ha! My great-grandfather came over from the
old country to find new things to count. Nothing in Transylvania but
hills. Pennsylvania full of chimneys, streetcars, traffic lights . . .
zat's what really counts, ha! ha!''
''What's that you're driiinking?'' squeaks Elmo. ''Is it juice?''
Sort of. Grown-ups' juice.
''Gee. I heard of that . . . '' Elmo says, his tone suggesting that
he's heard no good of it at all. I've already had to have a special
visitor's dispensation to smoke in the presence of Elmo and the Count
(''Are you guys sure that's okay?'' a minder asked them). Every time I
light up, the Count counts: ''Tree cigarettes -- ha! ha!'' -- or
whatever. Elmo says it's really bad for me. Maybe there are drawbacks to
living in Sesame Street after all.
Throughout this interlocution, by the way, I am looking Count Von
Count and Elmo straight in the eye. As far as I am concerned, there is
no-one else here. It's like The Wizard Of Oz -- pay no attention to that
man behind the curtain.
How does it feel being the baby of the family on Sesame Street, Elmo?
I'm the baby of a big family myself.
''Zat figures!'' chortles the Count. ''Figures, ha! ha!''
What's it like living on Sesame Street?
''Well,'' says Elmo, ''it's really convenient because it's closer than
everywhere else. You just get up in the morning and there it is.''
''But if ve liffed in London,'' adds Count Von Count, ''ve'd haff to
get a plane every day. Vun engine! Ha! Ha! Two engines! Ha! Ha! . . .''
I am here to have a nice chat with my favourite children's-TV
characters and I'm up against two of the Marx Brothers, giving weight
away all round. Last question: how do you get to Sesame Street?
''It's there!'' pipes Elmo, pointing to the wall behind me. So does
the Count, only he says ''It's zere!''. Would they say that Sesame
Street is a state of mind? ''Zat's vot ve said,'' says the Count,
pointing again, and this time I realise they were pointing at my head.
It's been great talking to you, I say. I'm overwhelmed.
''That's all that juice you drank,'' says Elmo.
* * *
LATER on I have a transatlantic chat with Michael Loman, executive
producer of Children's Television Workshop, which makes Sesame Street,
and ask him a few questions that I couldn't really ask of real
characters who just happen to live there.
From him I learn that Sesame Street is screened in more than 80
countries, that it was created by a lady called Joan Ganz Cooney, with a
big input from the late Muppetmeister Jim Henson; that it's now entering
its 27th season, and that surveys show that pre-school children who
watch Sesame Street do better than others when they get to school. It
was the first multi-ethnic children's show on TV, and unlike most other
children's TV shows it espouses good stuff like pride in learning, being
happy with being yourself, and not selling toys on the back of a TV
show.
I get slightly less change out of him when I ask about how so much of
Sesame Street is clearly aimed at its baby-boomer/Generation X cult
audience (ie guys like me), with its parodies of cheesey gameshows
(''Guy Smiley, America's favourite gameshow host!'') and the way that,
when they sing songs about crossing the road carefully, or not going off
with strangers, they do it in the style of Bruce Springsteen or Talking
Heads.
And no change at all when I ask about the threat posed by the newly
empowered American hard right to the funding of the dangerously liberal
Public Broadcasting Service, the federally funded TV network that is the
nearest thing America has to the BBC, and which shows Sesame Street
exclusively in the States (here we have it on Channel 4 and the
satellite/cable service, The Children's Channel).
Everyone likes Sesame Street, says Loman -- conservatives as well as
liberals. Sure: like Cookie Monster doesn't like cookies. It seems a
shame that the obviously liberal and right-on guy in charge of Sesame
Street won't stand up for what makes it so good. You can judge TV
programmes, as well as people, by their enemies.
Still and all, I'd still like to live on Sesame Street. And once I've
kicked smoking and got through the Betty Ford 12-step booze programme,
I'm going to apply for a visa. Sunny day . . .

TUGS of war -- or is it love -- go on all the time between countries
trying to grab inward investment.
However, there is a rather strange twist to the latest economic
struggle. Business Diary is told that the HIE is engaged in a battle to
attract a factory which manufactures contraceptives. Its main opponent,
we believe, is the Irish Republic where such devices are frowned upon --
if not illegal.
You would assume that the HIE would be odds-on to win this particular
battle, but we are told that the company is more interested in exports!
Fun and games
in Indonesia
SUMMER is approaching and with it the Highland games season. We have
to look forward to Luss, Braemar and Cowal, along with many others, but
if you fancy going further afield you could always choose Jakarta in
Indonesia.
Too expensive you may think, but if you join Strathclyde Business
Development's trade mission you could cut the cost of a normal tourist's
visit drastically.
SBD is organising a trade mission to Indonesia between May 20 and 27,
and participants are told they can choose to stay an extra day in
Jakarta to enjoy the Highland games.
The games were launched in 1975 by the local Scottish business
community and are now attended by up to 10,000 people.
Jim Martin of SBD, who is leading the trade mission, told Business
Diary: ''We timed this mission to coincide with the games in order to
highlight our presence.''
The convenor of Strathclyde Regional Council Bill Perry has been
invited to attend, but if Diary readers are interested in attacking the
200 million population market, then they should contact the SBD.
Sheila Kelly will help you with any arrangements if you contact her on
0141 227 3203.
Doing business
over dinner
IT would appear there is no time to relax if you are planning to get a
business venture off the ground, as 20 hopefuls who are attending a
dinner tonight in Clydebank have discovered.
The budding entrepreneurs are the latest intake of the Business
Ventures scheme funded jointly by the Glasgow Development Agency and The
European Partnership. The scheme brings together potential business
partners with compatible skills to create new Scottish companies.
Business wannabes are expected to have a minimum of #20,000 to invest
in a new project, although personal investment can go as high as
#200,000.
Tonight the 20 hopefuls will meet James Lee, a Chinese Canadian
businessman who has already participated in the Business Ventures
programme by teaming up with Glasgow businessman Ally Murray and two
other partners to create a new business in Scotland.
James Lee runs Pentranic Inc which operates in the computer hardware
sector of the games industry reworking cast tubes, and has flown to
Scotland to speak at the Clydebank sessions.
Since its inception two years ago Business Ventures has helped raise
more than #4m of equity to launch 24 new companies in Scotland.
On course for
breakfast at uni
ALISTAIR Campbell of Paisley University is hoping that Scottish
companies will team up with him to help develop their technology
management skills.
Paisley is a member of the Team Consortium of 15 UK educational
establishments, including Brunel University, Henley Management College
and the Warwick Business School, sponsored by the DTI to offer a new
masters degree in information technology management.
Campbell is inviting any companies that are interested in their
managers taking the degree course to join him and his colleagues for a
hearty Scottish breakfast in the university's staff restaurant on
Wednesday at 8am.
If you fancy a bite to eat, give him a ring on 0141 848 3881.
Let's drink to
foreign friends
HOW many times have we all been on a business trip abroad, attending a
conference or exhibition, and, having enjoyed the company, promised each
other that we would get together again at some future date?
The reunion rarely ever happens, but in the case of a group of travel
agents from Paris who went on an educational tour of Scandinavia in 1932
it turned out to be rather different.
They enjoyed themselves so much that when they returned home they
decided to invite some of the new friends they had made in Scandinavia
to France.
They also decided to form a club and having raised their glasses to so
many toasts during their ''educational visit'' they hit on the name
Skal.
There are now 500 Skal clubs in 85 countries, including 28 in the
British Isles. Next weekend the UK clubs are meeting for their 42nd
national assembly in Bournemouth.
Around 300 ''skalleagues'' are expected to be in the English resort
for the occasion. Among them will be Susan Bonner, president of the
Glasgow Skal Club.
While in Bournemouth, Bonner, who is the regional sales manager for
Moat House Hotels in Scotland will be pressing Glasgow's case to be the
host of the national assembly in the year 2000.
No doubt the toast ''Skal'' will be ringing out in Bournemouth next
weekend, but perhaps if they come to Scotland there might be a motion
forward for a name change to ''Slainte'', or if they are looking for a
compromise how about ''Cheers''?
Fiddlers off to
White House
THE Ayrshire Fiddle Orchestra is heading for the US this summer, where
among its venues will be a performance on the lawn of the White House
during the celebrations surrounding Independence Day.
The group is jetting off on June 25 with conductor Wallace Galbraith,
and the tour will also include playing in front of a 35,000 crowd at a
baseball stadium in Detroit.
The orchestra is hoping that local businesses will help sponsor the
visit as it has a financial shortfall and is looking to raise between
#8000 and #9000.
Among the fundraising events will be a sponsored 24-hour play-in
session between 8pm on Friday, May 5 and 8pm the following evening.
The orchestra is also hoping that firms will take out an advert in the
programme it is producing for the visit.
If you think you can help, give Wallace Galbraith a call on 01655
883333.
Sponsor a boy
from Brigade
YET another worthy cash call comes from the organisers of the BBig
Event, one of the largest Boys' Brigade events ever to take place in
this country.
Around 10,000 members are expected to travel to Lanarkshire to take
part in the weekend at Strathclyde Park on May 5-7, and it is sponsored
by the Lanarkshire Supercounty campaign.
But the organisers are concerned that some boys will not be able to
take part because of the costs involved, so they have launched a
sponsor-a-boy scheme.
Graham Simpson, convenor of the BBig Event finance committee, told
Business Diary: ''We have tried to help as much as possible with travel
costs and finding accommodation with families in the Lanarkshire area,
but this is a Scotland-wide event and some boys may not be able to
attend because of a shortage of funds.''
He is hoping Scottish businesses will rally round and sponsor a boy
for #5 a head. If you think your company could contribute give him a
ring on 01236 753421.
Special look
at Leuchars
DUNDEE and Tayside business people attending a fundraising event in
the officers' mess at RAF Leuchars on Friday will get a rare look behind
the scenes as well as an opportunity to have a flutter on 12 gaming
tables which are available for sponsorship.
The corporate sponsors of the evening will be invited at a later date
to a behind the scenes tour of the RAF station including the QRA --
Quick Reaction Alert -- where two fully armed and prepared Tornado F3s
are kept in a state of constant readiness.
The evening is being organised as part of the bid by RAF Leuchars to
raise #20,000 towards the Battle of Britain Memorial which is being
built on the white cliffs of Dover.
Nick Curtis, manager of the Sandford Hotel at Wormit, is the corporate
appeals organiser. He told Business Diary that to date around #7000 had
been raised, and that some of this money would go to the Sue Ryder
charity and a medical research centre.
Dundee and Tayside Chamber of Commerce has encouraged its members to
support the evening. The chamber's Bill Shaw, who has already been given
a backroom view of the RAF station including the QRA, was very impressed
by what he saw, telling the Diary: ''We are in good hands.''
Master minds to share
secrets of success
ANOTHER gathering of business gurus is due to take place next month
when the next Dunbartonshire Enterprise Premier Masterclass takes place
in Glasgow's Hospitality Inn on May 4.
The gathering will hear the collective thoughts of three prominent
businessmen: Sir Ian Wood, chairman and managing director of the Wood
Group, Jim McColl, chairman and chief executive of Clyde Blowers, and
Jack Black, course director of the personal development programme
MindStore, who will be presenting the event.
Together they will offer an insight into business creation in today's
marketplace, while drawing on personal experiences of developing their
own companies.
MindStore founder Black insists: ''We need to redress the balance of
entrepreneurs in this country. We need vision of Richard Branson's
calibre. We need to throw away our perpetual 'How can I do that'
attitude and adopt a 'That's what I want, therefore, I am going to get
it' way of thinking. We need people to adopt positive mental attitudes
so we can once again become a can-do society.''
If you are interested in going along to the full-day event, which
costs #50 including lunch, call free on 0800 703704.

A burst of solar energy is something everyone seems to enjoy when
winter has finally thawed away. And here, Wendy Jack celebrates that
spring feeling with thoughts of alfresco delights, while Kay Johnson
(left) offers a reminder that, though it's not all good cleaning fun,
that spring dust-down can be easier than it used to be
A FEW blinks of sunshine is all it takes, to tempt sun-starved bodies
out of doors to bask in the warm rays. Bliss. After months of dreich,
grey winter days, the thought of alfresco eating in the garden, on the
beach, by loch or river holds special delight.
Barbecues, picnics, meals on the patio, even a sandwich on a park
bench . . . there's something about the great outdoors that makes food,
however simple, taste great -- elevating mealtimes to new heights.
While some people, this writer included, are perhaps -- how shall we
put it? -- less than elegant in the execution of these little pleasures,
picnicking with a tatty assortment of mugs and plastic bags and
miscellaneous jars of this and that, others can raise the whole matter
to a veritable art form.
For them, diving into the car boot does not produce a couple of limp
Sainsbury's bags; instead, there will be one of those splendid wicker
picnic hampers of childhood memory, currently making a sweeping
resurgence. Inside is neatly stashed everything that anyone everyone
could possibly need -- from cutlery and cups through plates and saucers
to storage boxes and flasks. Ascot here we come.
All this aristocratic splendour won't ensure you enjoy your picnic any
better, of course, but having everything in its place and a place for
everything certainly has quite a lot going for it -- although at
somewhere in the region of #150 for the elegant option, the plastic bag
could remain attractive to some.
In the garden, life is simple for those who like to sit in the full
sun and roast, happily ignoring all advice to the contrary. But for
some, nice though the idea may be, the warming rays can become too much
of a good thing, resulting in quickly in headaches and unpleasant
rashes.
Food also can suffer in the sun, so that crisp salads wilt
unappetisingly, while chilled water, beer and wine turn tepid, rapidly
losing all appeal. What to do?
Habitat has brought out a novel canvas tent, rather an elegant affair
which stands on tall legs and offers shade merely above the head. It has
plenty of room for table and chairs or benches, and could become one of
the most useful items for garden leisure. It's ideal for sitting under,
too, if you want to avoid the full strength of the sun, and -- being
more of a canopy than a true tent -- it still allows enjoyment of the
fresh air and garden views.
Now, if you're off to the races, going shooting or fishing, or indeed
merely planning an outdoor party in the countryside, Marks and Spencer
has brought out an attractive range of accessories.
First essential is a travelling rug which has a water-resistant
backing and fits neatly into its own carrying bag. Two sizes are
available, at #55 or #33; or you can buy the usual kind of rug with
fringing for #25.
There's everything one could need here, from a shooting stick to a
neat bag containing a set of six chromium-plated steel boules -- which
includes the rules of this French favourite -- to stop boredom on the
beach. For non-drivers in the party, the range of drinks accessories,
from insulated wine carriers to flasks and little stainless steel cups,
is comprehensive and good looking in rich green, with leather straps and
trims. Very sporty.

* Our daughter will hopefully be successfully completing an honours
degree course within the next few months, and she has applied for a
place on another four-year university degree course starting this
autumn.
We would appreciate your advice as to the best way of funding the
course and the travelling expenses, as we believe it will require to be
totally self-financed.
We do not feel we can find the amounts involved from our joint incomes
of approximately #36,000 per annum, but we have investments, including
shares and PEPs amounting currently to #120,000 efficiently managed on a
discretionary basis by a stockbroker. We own our house valued at about
#85,000 with no mortgage outstanding, and also have insurance policies
due to mature within the next 10 years.
Should we be looking for a loan, or must some of our investments be
realised to cover our forthcoming commitment, and could you confirm that
the Inland Revenue does not allow such payments for an unsubsidised
educational course to be claimed as allowances against income tax?
* Once you have established that your daughter has been accepted and
that there is no external financial assistance available to her, you can
begin to tot up the likely costs to your finances. Given that it is a
four-year course, your commitment will be in the form of staged
payments, rather than having to put all the money up front.
There is no reason for you to expect relief from the Inland Revenue as
far as we can see from the facts you have given us.
You will certainly be in a position to raise a loan and so need not
sell investments if you do not want to. Your insurance policies are
presumably unencumbered, so you should be able to use them as security.
Some insurance companies lend money themselves and allow the outstanding
balance to be deducted from the final proceeds of the policy.
As an alternative, some of your investments could be used as security
for a bank overdraft, and they should enable you to negotiate this at a
lower rate of interest than would normally be available.
It is not clear from your letter how much this commitment would be
likely to cost you. The trouble with any loan is that it has to be
repaid, and this in itself can be a considerable burden on top of the
interest charges involved, but as you have no mortgage you should be
able to handle it.
Should you decide that you would rather fund the costs from your
investments, you need only dispose of assets as you need the funds.
Ultimately, the choice is yours.

* My partner and I bought our house jointly in 1987 taking a mortgage
of #50,000 which we pay equally. Tax relief on the mortgage interest
payments has been given in full to both of us. My partner now wishes to
sell his half of the house to a third party. As the rules on mortgage
tax relief changed in 1988 will I lose the tax relief I have on my
#25,000 share and be limited to relief on #15,000?
* Since August 1, 1998 the maximum amount of loan on which interest
attracts tax relief (#30,000) has been worked out on a per residence
basis rather than per person. This, however, does not apply to loans
taken out before then.
Although your partner has decided to sell his share of the property to
a third party, your own share of the mortgage continues to be the
original loan and, therefore, your entitlement to tax relief on #25,000
is protected. You must, however, retain the original loan and not
replace it with a new one for this to apply, so care needs to be taken
over the new financial arrangements.
If the new co-owner borrows money to purchase a share of the property,
interest payable will be restricted as far as that person is concerned.
* On a transfer of shares between husband and wife, what information
is required by the Inland Revenue? Please also say how the stamp duty is
calculated and where the transfer form is stamped.
* The transfer of shares between spouses does not give rise to a
capital gains tax liability, as the transfer is deemed to take place at
a value which produces neither a gain nor a loss. You are entitled to
add the appropriate indexation allowance to the original cost of the
shares, and it is this increased value the receiving spouse takes as the
tax cost.
You are required to advise the Inland Revenue of diposals of
chargeable assets, and you should note in your tax return the following
details: the date transferred, the number of shares involved, and the
date and cost of your original acquisition of them.
The question of stamp duty depends on whether the shares are sold by
one spouse to another. If they are, duty is payable at the rate of 0.5%
on the market value and goes to the Controller (Stamps) in Edinburgh. If
they are gifted no duty is due. The exemption is obtainable by signing
the certificate printed on the back of the share transfer form.

SPRING often arrives with a compulsion to clean. With longer days and
bright sunshine casting revealing light rays on accumulations of dust
and dirt, most householders are gripped by a manic need to wash, polish
and turn out cupboards.
Windows are usually the first to show the ravages of a long winter
and, if you are partial to water with vinegar, try a traditional window
scrim in pure linen instead of a sponge. Used by professional window
cleaners, the scrim leaves no marks or residue and is available by post
at #3.95 from Lakeland Plastics.
If a long reach is required, you will appreciate the new HausRein
window wiper from the German firm, Leifheit. Fitted with an aluminium
telescopic (two-metre) handle and a swivel joint, it is capable of both
cleaning and drying: the double-purpose head is fitted with high-quality
polyester fibre for washing and flexible rubber blade.
Leifheit offers an even more versatile appliance in the HausRein
floor-cleaner priced at about #24.95. It too has a flexible joint
allowing a variety of different cleaning movements. More importantly,
the long fibre polyester cover, which takes a firm hold of dust and
dirt, can be easily removed and put in the washing machine.
A second cover is also available for this mop which is meant
especially for the dusting of hardwood floors. Priced at #12, it is
especially noted for its ability to clean up pet hairs.
If you are undertaking a substantial spring clean and want to tackle
carpets and upholstery as well, the Hoover Aquajet 5000 is a must. This
versatile machine, with a 1250-watt motor, can wash carpets, hard floors
and upholstery and also suck up liquids and dry-vacuum. Offered at a
sale price of #149.99 until April 30, the Aquajet comes with a complete
set of tools which allow you to adapt to the job in hand. Among these
are a dusting brush and a tool to suck the dirt out of crevices.
The firm also offers a less-versatile shampoo polisher exclusively for
use with floors. It can be used to shampoo carpets or polish and scrub
hard floors and is supplied with a set of brushes designed for the
different surfaces (price about #129.99).
Last but certainly not least comes that standard household appliance,
the ironing board. It is a basic requirement if you are washing curtains
during your annual turn-out, but also necessary in terms of the present
fashion for natural fibres -- linen, cotton and silk.
The basic design of these household appliances has not really changed
over the years but the Italians have at least come up with a
prize-winning version that looks like an objet d'art when hanging on the
wall. With a frame of anodised aluminium and a top in galvanised steel
metal, covered in polyester, this highly stylised appliance comes in
blue, grey or green, from Amleto Design Group Italia. It is available
through Tony Walker and is priced at #220. The anodised aluminium wall
hook is #10.
* HausRein window wiper and floor-cleaner available from Crocket the
Ironmongers, 136 West Nile Street, Glasgow; James Gray &amp; Son Ltd, 89
George Street, Edinburgh; or Jenners, Princes Street, Edinburgh.
Lakeland Plastics is at Alexandra Buildings, Windermere, Cumbria LA23
1BQ or by phone 05394 88100. Tony Walker Home Interiors is at Whitehall
Court, 14 Telford Road, Edinburgh EH4 2BD, phone 0131 343 6151.

* In 1985 I took out a 10-year savings plan with an assurance society
investing the maximum amount of #100 per year. This plan has now matured
and I shall receive the princely sum of #1128 after the outlay of a
total of #1000 which, if my calculations are correct, shows an
appreciation of approximately 2.5% per annum.
I would be obliged if you could tell me if this could be considered a
normal return on these plans, or have I just been unlucky? If it is not
normal, could you please give an indication of the return I could
reasonably expect for this type of plan and the return I could have got
from a building society?
I know that this society has had problems but the literature
describing the product indicated double figure percentage growth. Was
this a reasonable prediction in 1985, or was it really just a carrot to
sell the plan?
I am funding two further plans taken out in 1991. Bearing in mind that
the surrender values for my age group (over 60) show only about 50%
return, would you consider I should stay with this society now that a
merger with another one is proposed, or should I cut my losses and look
elsewhere?
* This return is very poor and compares badly with the product's
peers. The better plans, such as those from Family Assurance and
Tunbridge Wells, have about doubled the money put in over 10 years, but
generally the tax advantages of friendly societies have not produced
above average performance from their savings plans.
Putting the monthly amount into the building society would not have
produced much more because small amounts attract only low interest.
National Savings would have produced more. As regards the sales
literature, past performance is no guide to the future even though it is
widely used for marketing purposes. The future performance of these
particular policies should be better and it would probably be worthwhile
to stay with them now.
* In two or three years I expect to purchase an annuity from my
pension policies -- presumably from an insurance company -- and would
like to know if the 90% no-limit protection would apply. If so, would
90% of the capital sum be protected or would 90% of the annual annuity
be protected (that is, paid) until my death?
Also on the subject of annuities, I have a very small (about #1000)
open-market value S226 policy with Legal &amp; General that will mature in
July. Would it be worth my while writing to a few leading companies in
the annuity field to see if they could better the L&amp;G offer, or would I
be wasting my time on account of the setting up fee or other charges? My
financial adviser is not interested in handling such a small matter.
* In the unlikely event of the insurance company from which you buy
your annuity going under, the Policyholders' Protection Board would step
in and arrange that the industry as a whole provided compensation. The
board would ensure that you would receive 90% of the benefits you had
from the insurance company, so this proportion of your annuity payments
would continue.
As regards the outstanding policy, it is really so small that it would
not be worth bothering looking elsewhere and, as you say, expenses might
be higher.
* My nephew has inherited #33,000 which is at present in a building
society. He is an unmarried student studying abroad and does not require
to use this money. He is no longer resident in this country. What would
you advise for low-risk investments for monthly income and high capital
growth?
* You are asking for the impossible. You can have security and a
monthly income or security with (modest) capital growth, but you cannot
have all three together. Your nephew is presumably young so he can
perhaps be a little adventurous, so long as he does not expect to need
the money for several years, and go for capital growth by investing in
shares through an offshore fund (for tax reasons).
We would suggest a mix of funds from Guinness Flight (UK,
international and Far East, excluding Japan), M&amp;G (UK) and Templeton
(international).
The risk profile could be reduced by putting a proportion into a
managed currency fund, say from Hambros, and a sterling fixed-interest
fund, such as those from Barclays and Hill Samuel, which incidentally
has a fund paying monthly income. The relative proportion of the
currency and fixed-interest funds could be increased if income is
required.
* I am anticipating shortly taking compulsory or voluntary redundancy
with a pension of #19,000 per annum and a lump sum of around #70,000. In
two years at age 55 the pension will be index-linked.
My wife and I have modest savings of #5000 and I may be entitled to
unemployment benefit for the first six to 12 months unless I find
suitable employment. Our house is worth #140,000 with a building society
loan of #65,000 secured by two endowment policies, one for #24,000
maturing in 2006 and the other for #41,000 maturing in 2014.
Assuming no alterations to capital, savings or income, can you please
advise how best to proceed? Should I reduce or clear off my mortgage?
How else would you recommend investing the #70,000 or part thereoff?
* Desirably at retirement one would hope for a capital sum to invest
on top of a decent pension and no outstanding mortgage debt. Were your
endowment policies close to maturity this would be your situation.
Unfortunately, one has 11 years to run and the other 19. You could
contact the insurance companies to see if it would be possible to
negotiate earlier maturity dates, though this would have the effect of
reducing the proceeds.
Your pension is substantial enough, especially as it will be
index-linked in two years, provided that you do not have a large
mortgage to service.
Unless you intend to move to a less expensive house, your top priority
should be to reduce your mortgage by a substantial amount. Normally we
would recommend eliminating it altogether, but this would leave you with
very little capital.
A compromise would be to use half of your #70,000 to reduce your
mortgage to #30,000, the ceiling for the diminishing tax relief on
mortgage interest payments. Including your existing savings this would
leave you with #40,000 to invest. You would probably want some income
from this unless you find alternative employment.
Gilts or building society accounts would provide you with income, but
hopefully you would be able to allocate some of your funds to providing
you with capital growth for greater security in the future. For the
small investor, investment and unit trusts are suitable for this
purpose.

THE Stock Exchange still seems to be not very busy going nowhere in
particular. The break over 3150 for the FTSE-100 index did seem to be a
sign the market was reasonably satisfied the economy was not going to be
brought to a juddering halt by a nasty rise in interest rates. But we
still seem to lack that elusive feel good factor and interest rate
worries keep coming back.
The forecasts of how far company earnings can continue to grow may
have been trimmed a little, but both earnings and dividends are
predicted to grow this year and again next.
This month's survey of UK fund manager optimism for broker Smith New
Court found that more were buyers of UK equities. A balance of 28% were
planning to increase their weightings in the UK against 21% in March.
The survey, which looks separately at the top 100 companies and the
smaller ones in the 250 index, reported ''a big swing in favour of
smaller companies''.
There have, in fact, been some encouraging results recently from small
UK companies both in the 250 and under it. Among these, plastics
specialist Doeflex, whose management recently took the trouble to visit
Scotland to talk to investors, pushed its profits up 49% last year and
seemed confident of further growth.
The readiness of UK fund managers to invest in smaller companies,
together with the greater liquidity of the London market, is now
attracting the attention of some of France's smaller companies. A French
companies show is currently being planned for June.
Gilbert Elsas, one of its Anglo-French promoters, comments: ''Recent
surveys have shown that British fund managers will invest in smaller
companies provided they can first meet the management.''
He hopes to bring between 10 and 20 French firms to the UK for a
one-day show where top executives will be able to talk to potential UK
investors. ''The major French companies, those in the CAC-40 index, are
reasonably well known in the UK. But there are others which are not so
well known and which may be good growth companies with plenty of
investment potential.
''The UK market is a good place to have a second listing. Paris is a
small market with few institutional investors and no pension funds as
yet. By broadening their investor base, smaller and medium-sized French
companies can improve the liquidity of their shares. All European
companies will in time be coming to London to woo investors.''
Although the uncertainty over the French presidential election, where
voting starts this weekend, is hanging over the market at present, he
says: ''The French economy is picking up. The recovery began later than
the UK's so it has further to go.''
Although the French have traditionally gone mainly to banks to raise
capital for expansion, he believes more will be looking to the market,
particularly if liquidity in their shares can be improved.
One of the companies interested in meeting fund managers in the UK is
Coflexip whose shares are already quoted in America on the Nasdaq
Exchange. It is a supplier of such things as flexible pipes to the oil
industry and is already active in Aberdeen. Another smaller firm which
is also international in its outlook is Stedim which makes sterile
plastic products for the medical industry.
If all goes well Gilbert Elsas hopes to make the French companies show
an annual event. This year it is being held in London but he does not
rule out a visit to Scotland at some time in the future.
One problem with smaller companies is that their share prices tend to
be more volatile than those of the large ones, a feature which can, of
course, make them more exciting. This applies to companies in the
mid-250 index on the London exchange as well as the really small ones.
Smith New Court, which has been checking back over the figures for the
last 10 years, says they show a greater degree of cyclicality. Looking
for a reason the broker says it ''may be attributed to the high
proportion of general manufacturers in the 250 compared to the 100 (33%
against 15%), or it could simply be that smaller companies are more
exposed to swings in sales''.
The broker's strategists say their view is that, while the global
economy is likely to slow down, it is ''unlikely to collapse''. The
firm's central economic forecast is for the UK to experience only a
gradual deceleration in the rate of economic growth through this year.
This, it says, ''should help contain inflationary pressures, prevent the
need for any major rise in interest rates from here and see the FTSE-250
start to out-perform the FTSE-100''.
It has added Hewden-Stuart, the plant hire specialist, to its buy list
on the basis that construction companies may be more keen to lease their
equipment needs while the economy slows down. Also going on to the
strategic buy list -- despite a sell recommendation by analysts -- is
Ocean Group, where a new chief executive joined last year. Recent
earnings forecasts have been rising and bearishness is said to be
diminishing.
Its sell list remains unchanged, continuing to include Highland
Distilleries, for whom the strategists are concerned competition could
worsen.
Glenda Boswell of the Boswell partnership in London, co-organiser of
the French companies show, says it will be for ''fund managers and
advisors to meet the companies and will not be open for private
investors''. As well as information on the companies, comments and
forecasts by French brokers are expected to be available.
Small UK companies have had a number of shows. Broker Hoare Govett has
organised two which ''worked very well''. Later this year, probably in
October, the fifth company investor show is expected to be held under
the sponsorship of merchant banker Singer and Friedlander.
Organiser John Breckon expects some 40 to 50 UK companies with
capitalisations ranging from #16m to #140m to be there. He says interest
already being expressed indicates companies value such meetings.

A part-time nurse recently discovered she could have been claiming
subscriptions to the Royal College of Nursing for the past six years as
an extra tax relief.
WHEN anything marked Inland Revenue drops through the letter box it's
easy to groan and put it to one side -- unless it happens to be a
rebate, of course. But don't ignore that tax return which may have
appeared on your doormat recently.
At the very least it should spur you into checking that you are
claiming all the allowances and reliefs you are entitled to -- and
remind you to mop up any allowances you might have been missing for the
past six tax years too.
Many people don't realise there are some expenses connected with their
work that they can set against tax. To claim, the expense must be
incurred solely for the purpose of your job and be a necessary expense
for anyone in your type of work.
It could, for instance, include professional subscriptions. One Herald
reader, a part-time nurse, recently discovered that she could have been
claiming subscriptions to the Royal College of Nursing for the past six
years as an extra tax relief. Once she has made her claim she could be
in line for a substantial rebate of tax she has overpaid in the past.
If you are self-employed now is the time to be making plans if you
want to make a dent in your next instalment of tax due on July 1 or to
claim a rebate that could help pay for your summer holiday.
Personal pensions -- and their predecessors, retirement annuities --
play an important part in financial planning for the self-employed. They
are also open to employees who don't have or choose not to belong to a
company pension scheme.
Whether you are employed or working for yourself, the money you put
into a pension plan reduces your tax bill at your highest rate of tax.
This is particularly useful now that the value of other tax breaks, such
as mortgage tax relief and the married couple's allowance, is being cut
right back.
The tax relief means that a pension contribution of, say, #1000 saves
a 25% taxpayer #250 in tax so effectively costs only #750 in net terms,
with the Revenue making up the rest. For a higher-rate payer the net
cost goes down to #600.
If you are employed you get the benefit immediately because you pay
your contributions net of basic-rate tax relief. (Higher-rate relief has
to be claimed separately.) If you are self-employed you cannot pay your
contributions net, even though it could help tremendously when your cash
flow is under pressure. To benefit from the tax relief you have to make
sure you tell the Revenue about the contributions when you fill in your
tax return.
The information you give on the return now waiting to be dealt with
enables the Revenue to work out how much you will have to pay in January
and July next year.
If you have recently put money into a personal pension that will help
to reduce the amount you have to pay next year -- but that could be many
months after you have actually paid your contributions. You can,
however, enjoy the benefit of tax relief well before then by ''carrying
back'' the contributions you have paid. If you carry-back, pension
contributions paid in one tax year are treated as though they were paid
in the previous one.
The 1994/95 tax year has just ended, but if you made pension
contributions during the 12 months to April 5 this year you can choose
to carry these back to tax year 1993/94. That effectively reduces your
taxable income for that year and, therefore, your tax bill. If you want
to do this, you have to tell the Inland Revenue within three months of
the end of the tax year -- that is, you have until July 5 to make your
decision.
If you can't fill in your return by then, don't worry. Ask your
pension company (or your tax office) for forms PP43 and PP120. These
then need to be sent, with evidence that you've paid the contributions,
to your tax office.
You could be in line for an immediate refund, or as immediate as the
Inland Revenue can arrange. Why? Well, you have already paid half the
tax due for your accounting year which ended in the 1993/94 tax year.
The first payment was made on January 1 and the second instalment is due
on July 1.
But the extra relief you gain by carrying back your pension
contributions reduces your taxable income for that year. So if you hand
over the amount already assessed in the second instalment you will pay
too much. The tax due must be changed to reflect the extra relief. Once
you have told the Revenue that you want to carry back it will probably
reduce that second instalment, so you will have less tax to find on July
1. But you can press for a refund instead.
Carrying back is even more worthwhile if you were paying higher-rate
tax but have now dropped back to basic rate because of lower earnings.
By arranging to carry your contributions back you will be due relief at
40% of the payment rather than the 25% due on your lower, current
earnings.
''But if you're going to be a higher-rate taxpayer in the current year
you'd be ill-advised to carry back if you were previously a basic-rate
payer,'' says Robin Carr, pensions product manager at Scottish
Provident.
Scottish Provident has a useful free guide to carrying back pension
contributions which is available by phoning 0131 558 2285.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland is offering a new range of fixed-rate
mortgages aimed at first-time buyers and those needing 100% loans. There
are choices of one, two and three-year fixes at rates from 6.95% to
9.15%, though longer terms are also available. Legal and survey fees of
up to #1000 can be added to the loan even if this takes it over 100%.
The arrangement fee, which ranges from #200 to #295, can also be added.
PROVIDENT Life is launching a growth bond which guarantees a return of
at least 150% over six years. If the increase in the FTSE-100 index is
greater than 50% over this period then the sum invested will increase by
100% of this performance. The index gain is calculated on the average of
the index values at the end of each year from year three on.
THE Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds has published a
free leaflet called PEPs And Pensions: Planning For A Better Retirement.
A copy can be obtained by telephoning 0181 207 1361.
FRAMLINGTON is offering a 2% discount on its income and growth PEPs.
The income PEP invests in Framlington's Extra Income Trust which has
out-performed its sector average over the last three, five and 10 years.
FOREIGN &amp; Colonial has made available a high interest deposit option
for its low-cost pension savings plan. Planholders will be free to
switch from the investment trust to deposit and vice versa. The plan's
charges are limited to #100 initial and #50 annual.
BARCLAYS Bank is offering new borrowers a capped rate mortgage of
6.99% for two years and has introduced a new mortgage with a rate fixed
at 9.25% for the first five years. Barclaycard holders qualify for
cashbacks of up to #1500.

ONE of the many joys of spring gardens is the excited twittering of
birds in courtship -- so Past Times' replica of a Victorian
ivy-decorated nesting box can be a real delight, writes Wendy Jack.
Made of seasoned, sealed softwood, complete with a leaded sheet roof,
its white walls are prettily painted with ivy leaves, and -- sensibly --
the back can be taken off for cleaning. It costs #34.95.
Another animal novelty should also amuse while being practical too.
Fiendish felines that despoil your garden won't take kindly to the
awesome-looking black silhouette of a cat to ''plant'' or hang, as
warning-off sign, complete with gleaming glass eyes. At #5.95 he could
be a purr-fect solution.
This summer, nostalgia rules, and Victorian gardens represent the
theme for a range of reproduction memorabilia produced by Past Times.
Recalling the ''show theatres'', a bold display of pot plants can be
seen to huge effect with an inspired revival -- three weather-proofed
wooden shelves, decoratively arranged to maximum effect. Fill them with
pots of your favourite plants -- geraniums, pelargoniums, trailing ivies
and lobelia, ferns, begonias, tiered to look their best, and you will be
rewarded with glorious colour and form all summer long. It costs #125.

WHEN the sun starts to come out at this time of year, many people's
thoughts turn to home improvements. Unless it is just a lick of paint,
there may be hefty sums involved in financing a major improvement. If
you are employing a large firm to supply the materials and do the work,
a financial package may be offered. But consider first whether you can
borrow the money more cheaply from your bank or building society before
accepting this type of deal.
According to the latest survey of home improvements by the Halifax
Building Society, two in five of its customers carry out major
improvements each year. It found that the most popular in Scotland in
the last year was double glazing, followed by home security, a fitted
kitchen, a new bathroom and garden improvements. The main reasons home
owners gave for making these changes were to improve their standard of
living and add value to their property.
However, the building society's valuers pointed out that while all
improvements can add some value, this may not fully cover your outlay.
Only with two improvements -- central heating and a garage -- can you
expect to fully cover the costs through a corresponding increase in the
value. Improvements which are likely to add value but only at a
percentage of the cost are extensions, conservatories, double glazing,
loft conversions and fitted kitchens.
When you are considering how to finance such an improvement, there are
two main alternatives: an unsecured or secured loan. The main difference
between them is that with a secured loan, or extension to your mortgage,
your home acts as security. This means that if you do not keep up your
repayments the lender can force a sale to obtain repayment.
Normally your choice will be influenced by how much you want to borrow
and how quickly you can afford to repay it.
Unsecured personal loans are normally available for amounts starting
from #500 up to between #5000 and #15,000. Repayment can be over between
one and five years.
Interest rates often vary according to the amount borrowed. The more
you take, the lower the rate. This is normally fixed for the duration of
the loan so you know precisely what your repayments will be.
A variety of different institutions now offer unsecured personal
loans. Besides banks and building societies, telephone insurer Direct
Line and retailer Marks &amp; Spencer are prepared to lend in this way.
Interest rates should be compared carefully. You may be offered a
preferential rate if you are an existing customer but it is still
possible you could do better elsewhere. Make sure it is the APR you are
looking at because this enables you to compare like with like. Some
lenders still quote flat rates when first asked for information, and
these can be only half the level of the true interest rate as reflected
by the APR.
Rates for loans currently range from under 15% to more than 25%,
depending on the lender and the amount borrowed. So shopping around is
certainly worthwhile. Besides checking the rate, find out whether any
penalty is charged if you repay early. Typically, one or two months
interest may be payable, but not all lenders levy a charge, and if two
are charging similar interest rates, this may be a feature worth
considering.
The Alliance &amp; Leicester, which claims to be the largest building
society provider of unsecured personal loans, recently announced it was
cutting rates on those financing home improvements. It has brought the
cost of borrowing amounts between #5000 and #7500 down from an APR of
17.5% to 14.9%. This lowers the repayments on a #5000 loan taken out for
three years by #6 a month. On loans of #2000 to #5000 the rate is now
15.9% instead of 17.5%.
Would-be borrowers can arrange a loan with the Alliance and Leicester
over the phone (call 01162 555555) or through one of its branches.
The Halifax is also making a special spring offer on home improvement
loans. This applies to secured loans being added to an existing
mortgage. The advantage of this kind of loan is that you can choose a
repayment period of up to 25 years, which makes it an attractive method
for borrowing larger amounts. For customers who apply for home
improvement loans before May 31 it is waiving the administration charge
-- a saving of up to #100 -- and offering a free revaluation normally
costing #65 or more.
The amount you can borrow via such a loan will depend on your current
mortgage and value of your home. Your lender's normal criteria will
usually apply.

<TEXT>
THE number of business failures in Scotland rose dramatically in the
first quarter of this year from the previous three months, but the level
was little changed from January-March 1994, accountancy firm KPMG Peat
Marwick said yesterday.
A similar trend was also visible in the north of England, but
elsewhere in the UK the number of companies going into receivership fell
steadily.
Rodney Owen, the KPMG partner in Edinburgh who deals with receivership
in Scotland, said the rate of corporate failure in Scotland was still
very low and the latest figures did not indicate a deteriorating
business climate.
KPMG said 36 firms went out of business in Scotland between January
and March this year, compared with 23 in the previous quarter and 35 in
the first three months of 1994.
In the UK as a whole, the number of corporate failures fell from 604
in the first quarter of 1994 to 507 in the first three months of 1995.

SCOTTISH Amicable Life Assurance said yesterday it had accepted all
applications for shares in its new fixed income Dumyat Investment Trust,
which has been tailor-made for Personal Equity Plans, writes ROBERT
POWELL.
The convertible dividend shares of 5p each were placed at 100p, plus a
total of 5.25p in fees in commissions, yesterday.
Scottish Amicable said it had accepted applications for just over 139
million shares paying annual dividends of 7.75p gross per annum and just
over 26 million shares paying monthly dividends yielding 7.40p per gross
per annum.
Gavin Stewart, the head of product marketing at Scottish Amicable,
said 70% of the fund would be invested in UK equities and the remaining
30% in UK and foreign fixed-rate securities.
''The money was invested in a PEP which was then placed into the
investment trust by Scottish Amicable,'' he said.
Stewart said Edinburgh solicitors Dickson Minto had secured the Dumyat
Trust's listing on the stock exchange, where it would start trading on
Tuesday.
The Trust, which begins its legal existence on Monday, will
automatically be wound up after 5[1/2] years unless the shareholders
decide otherwise, he added.

AN unexpected, albeit marginal, fall in retail sales last month has
provided the strongest evidence so far that the economy has slowed down
from the hectic pace of last year in response to the tightening of
fiscal and monetary policy.
Were it not for the sharp fall in sterling over the same timespan, it
seems likely that the widely-expected rise in interest rates in the
current quarter would have been postponed indefinitely.
On Wednesday, when both the pound and the dollar were in the doldrums,
sterling's trade-weighted index fell to its lowest-ever level. At that
point the pound had lost 5.5% of its international value so far this
year.
Since then a rally in the dollar has allowed the pound to retrieve
some of its lost ground restricting its fall to about 4.5% since the
start of the year.
By any standards this is a significant drop, especially when it is
added to the massive devaluation that has taken place since Britain left
Europe's exchange rate mechanism in September 1992.
Devaluations act as a stimulant to economic activity since they
improve the competitive position of the traded goods sector.
Rule-of-thumb calculations suggest that sterling's decline so far this
year will have roughly the same effect as a 1% reduction in interest
rates.
Minutes of the March 8 meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer
and the Governor of the Bank of England showed the two men were
perturbed by the pound's weakness when the decline was only about half
what it now is.
James Capel's Adam Cole said: ''Having set the markets up for a base
rate increase to offset sterling's weakness with the release of the
monetary minutes earlier in the week, the Bank is unlikely to be put off
by a further month of weak retail sales data.''
Were the authorities to forego a rate rise on May 5, the day after the
local elections in England and Wales, sterling would be dangerously
vulnerable. Yesterday the Treasury Bill rate began to move up in
anticipation of a rate rise.
Moreover without a rate hike the Bank of England would be forced to
concede a deterioration in the inflation outlook when it publishes its
quarterly inflation report on May 11.
The City had expected a 0.3% rise in retail sales in March. Instead
they fell by 0.1%, though February's upsurge was revised up from 1.2% to
1.3%. Even so there was a drop of 0.1% in the volume of sales in the
first quarter, the first decline since the recession in 1991.
It is not clear to what extent the weakness of sales in March was
attributable to the lateness of Easter. Last year Easter straddled March
and April and it is likely that there was some adverse effect from the
absence of a holiday stimulant on the High Street this year.
Last month's retail sales were 1.8% ahead of the same period last year
after seasonal adjustment. In the first quarter sales were 1.5% higher
than in the same quarter of last year.
The food and clothing and footwear sectors sported gains of 0.2% in
sales between the latest two quarters. Mixed retail sales were flat, but
all other categories suffered a downturn, which was particularly marked
in the other non-food sector, mainly covering small traders.
Part of the problem is that consumer spending is being diverted to
other activities, such as the National Lottery and foreign holidays. In
the fourth quarter of last year consumer expenditure was relatively
buoyant. But its 0.8% gain was in contrast to a modest increase of 0.2%
in retail sales. Something similar may have happened in the latest
quarter.
The Retail Consortium was surprisingly upbeat about the latest
figures, though it did repeat its traditional plea to the Chancellor to
avoid a further rise in interest rates ''which would only have a
negative impact upon consumer confidence''.
The consortium's trading policy director, Hugh Clark, said: ''Retail
sales in March maintained the better trend achieved through February. It
is important when considering the results to bear in mind the adverse
effect of the timing of Easter which was two weeks later this year. It
would be wrong to regard March as a month of decline.''
The authorities might take their cue from this. Independent economists
are divided on the need for a rate rise. The highly-rated Goldman Sachs
team argues that the continued evidence of a slowdown in retail spending
is likely to leave the authorities comfortable with the current level of
base rates.
''Until there is clear evidence that the present pause in activity has
come to an end the authorities may be reluctant to raise base rates
again.''
Yet any decision to leave rates unchanged on May 5 would be no more
than a postponement of the inevitable, a risky strategy in times of
foreign exchange turbulence.

THE Euro Disney roller-coaster turned up yesterday, with the shares
climbing 12p to 183p when the company reported losses lower than
expected for the six months to March.
The loss was still Ffr241m (#30.7m). But this compared with
expectations of nearer Ffr280m and was a 77% reduction on the comparable
figure in the previous year.
The group was upbeat about prospects yesterday, but everything depends
on how successful it will be in the summer.
Euro Disney is pinning a lot on its new #65m ''Space Mountain''
attraction which is the largest ride in any Disney park.
''It's a real white-knuckle ride and we're expecting it to prove very
popular,'' said a Euro Disney spokesperson. She added that forward
bookings for the summer were going very well.
The group has cut prices from the beginning of April. Peak prices are
down from #32 to #25, with children down from #22 to #19, while off peak
rates are #19 and #15 respectively. The prices of food sold in the park
are also lower than they were.
Euro Disney took an axe to costs, reducing staff numbers and
relaunched itself with a new business plan and marketing strategy.
First-half margins improved as a result.
First-half hotel revenues were 7% ahead at #85m on the back of a good
improvement in occupancy though room rates had to be reduced to attract
custom.
Euro Disney shares have recovered from a low this year of 118p and the
group should move strongly into profit for the year, though whether by
sufficient margin to justify its current #1400m market capitalisation
remains to be seen.

OAK BROOK (Illinois), Friday -- McDonald's has posted record earnings
in the first quarter following strong sales of its burgers, Egg
McMuffins and other products and a boost from the weak dollar overseas.
The world's largest restaurant chain saw net income rise 15% to
$280.7m (#175m), or 39 cents a share, from $243.4m (#152m), or 33 cents
a share. Sales grew 20% to $2160m (#1350m) from $1800m (#1125m).
Vice-chairman Jack Greenberg said the company expects to post another
year of record earnings in 1995, based on sales growth at existing
restaurants and expansion overseas. Last year McDonald's earned $1200m
(#750m), or $1.68 a share, on sales of $8320m (#5200m).
''We expect to have another record year with a significant increase in
sales, operating income and net income,'' said the vice-chairman. The
first-quarter results were about in line with Wall Street's
expectations.
Total sales at all McDonald's US restaurants grew 8% in the quarter,
boosted by special-priced promotions of Big Macs, Egg McMuffins and
other products.
McDonald's opened 472 new restaurants in the quarter, bringing the
number of company-owned, franchised and affiliated units to 9795 in the
US at March 31.
But sales at McDonald's restaurants overseas jumped 30% because of
stronger foreign currencies as well as new openings and sales growth at
existing units.
The weakness of the dollar against the pound, Japanese yen, German
mark and other currencies added almost $10m to the bottom line in the
quarter.
There were 1138 McDonald's restaurants in Japan and 584 in Germany out
of a total of 5575 overseas in the quarter.
Of the 1200 to 1500 restaurants McDonald's plans to open this year,
about two-thirds will be outside the US, Mr Greenberg said, adding about
20% of those will be in countries where McDonald's did not operate five
years ago.
McDonald's also plans to open about 1000 so-called satellite
restaurants each year. These satellites often have a limited menu and
are located inside a retail store or in conjunction with a petrol
station. -- Reuter.

It doesn't matter whether you carry the weight of the world with you
or have bags of confidence.All will be revealed by the state and
contents of your handbag. Anvar Khan found a clutch of three victims
willing to open up to psychological inspection.
I carry around what I need. Anything else I just bin. I like to know
what I've got. I like to be on top of everything -- on the ball.
Open and shut case: (from top left) Nikki, Lesley and Barbara.
IT IS a testament to the courage of journalism, that when someone else
has the power to analyse character, the pen is quiet, and the hack
invisible. In probably the first newspaper personality quiz, three very
brave women volunteer the contents of their handbags for analysis by
chartered clinical psychologist Roslyn Taylor. And you can't see this
wimp for dust.
Lesley Rendall, 34, administration clerk.
Bag: #69 from a sale at Debenhams.
Contents: a pair of black leather gloves, a Daily Record, a hairbrush,
#26 sunglasses by Fabris Lane Italia, a bank card wallet, driving
licence, a necklace, autobank statements, a VISA pay-in slip, a balance
of account, two Halifax account cards, keys, loose change, a purse with
a faulty zip, a pouch bag with diamante earrings, broken gold jewellery,
two brochures for credit from River Island and M &amp; S, ten #1 tokens for
CDs, a reminder from BT, receipts from Asda, a Good News Car Hire price
list, receipts from Boots, old scrunched-up tissues, chewing gum, a BT
phone bill, an empty box of Andrex wipes, last year's diary, two maps of
Edinburgh, a small bottle of Maclean's mouthwash, a payslip, an empty
Debenhams wallet, paracetamol, a pen, a hairclip, a train timetable, a
diary/address/telephone book, an unsigned contract of employment for
Scottish Brewers, this year's diary and three loose tampax.
Make-up: eyelash curlers, Christian Dior eyeshadow compact, sample
bottles of Re-Balance Shine Gel, Chanel Cristalle Eau de Toilette and
Chanel tinted moisturiser, five lipsticks, two Oriflame lipliners, a
Body Shop compact blusher brush, honey lip balm, Clinique mascara,
eyeshadow brush and an Oriflame make-up bag and compact mirror.
Lesley: ''It's hard to believe but I know where everything is.
Normally I just wear the one lipstick but sometimes I change it in the
afternoon.
''The broken gold is still to be dropped off at the jewellers. I keep
last year's diary because it's got phone numbers at the back.
''I'm a clutter with make-up, they're mostly freebies with other
purchases. I'm quite happy to carry all this about. I know it needs
cleaning -- but what the heck. I like to have it all with me in case I
need something.''
Roslyn: ''Lesley is a sociable person, more interested in people and
relationships than work. She's a free, off-the-wall character, bright,
but may come across as a dizzy blonde. She likes the good things in life
but probably doesn't have the money for them. Lesley's probably got an
overdraft. She has very few career aspirations and will change a job
rather than seek promotion. She's flirtatious. Her bag is her life.
She's always ready to party at the drop of a hat.''
* Nikki McKay, 21, branch clerk.
Bag: #12.99 two years ago from Miss Selfridge.
Contents: a packet of McCowan's Highland toffee chews, a Guinness
diary, an address book, a glasses case, a scrunchy, a bottle of Amarige
by Givenchy, a chequebook, a pen, a can of Boots Camelia deodorant,
Boots dental floss, a purse, an ID badge for work, an umbrella, a pair
of black leather gloves, a comb, a Body Shop nail file, and a Boots
lipstick in an oriental lipstick case.
Nikki: ''I use a smaller bag at weekends. This is good because it's
big enough that when you're shopping you can stuff things in.
''Everything stays in my bag. The only things that come out are my
lipstick and perfume which I change every day.
''The reason I've got the dental floss is because I was at the
dentist's the other week and he told me I should be using it.
''I carry around what I need. Anything else I just bin. I like to know
what I've got. I like to be on top of everything -- on the ball.''
Roslyn: ''Nikki is very organised, maybe obsessionally so. The
sweeties indicate a need for stimulation but she doesn't go for a
stimulating lifestyle. She is more task-orientated than career-minded.
She probably gets rather tetchy and annoyed with people who are not as
organised as she is. She's quite tense and perhaps a worrier, hence the
smoking.''
* Barbara Cavanagh, 27, administrative assistant.
Bag: #7 from Salisburys a year and a half ago.
Contents: a notebook, a purse, two chequebooks (new and nearly
finished), the work's lottery tickets, a driving licence, a pen, a pair
of earrings, a contact lens case, keys, extra-strong mints, a bill to be
paid and a bottle of homeopathic vitamins.
Barbara: ''I don't go for expensive handbags, #20's my limit. I've
never won anything on the lottery yet. I use birthdays, door numbers,
anniversaries. I use the notebook to keep a tally of what I have in the
bank.
''My handbag and shoes always match. I would never consider putting
anything in my pockets.
''I only have one extra strong mint a day, or Polos when I feel like
it.
''I'm taking the vitamins because my sister's getting married and I've
heard they make your nails grow longer''
Roslyn: ''I get the impression there's a person inside Barbara
struggling to get out. She's not a raver. She has a good sense of
traditional family values. She's a forward planner, which is why she has
a new chequebook waiting for the old to run out. She dresses very well
and wants to make a good impression. She limits her pleasure. There's
nothing indulgent in her bag. The lottery is her wee adventure. She
needs more confidence, to have a better view of herself and to realise
that she is attractive''

* ''DON'T ever wear artistic jewellery; it wrecks a woman's
reputation.'' (Colette Gigi, 1873-1954.) Roger Billcliffe fine art is
extending his Mayfest contribution to encompass a major design
exhibition. Jack Cunningham's brooches have been described as
''eccentric'', ''unique'' and ''imaginative''.
He is a lecturer at Glasgow School of Art and has exhibited in London,
New York and Italy. He uses a variety of metals, precious stones,
copper, brass and aluminium. A member of Flux, The Glasgow Fine Metals
Group, who comprise of nine designer-metalworkers, most of his work is
executed to private commission and each piece may take a considerable
time to make. Jack Cunningham's Brooches is on from April 28 to May 30.
* VISITORS to every single Richards shop in the UK on April 27 will be
able to join staff in helping to find a cure for Breast Cancer. Richards
shops across the country have already raised #150,000 for the Breast
Cancer charity, Breakthrough. For 1995, the stores have chosen to focus
on next Thursday which has been designated as Crocus Day. Customers will
be invited to join in fund-raising events.
* HENARA Treatment Wax contains henna, honey and almond oil which
combine to create an intense conditioner that gently restores shine to
hair. It can be used on all types and colours of hair and is ideal for

A feast of fashion and art will assail Edinburgh in sound and colour.
KENNEDY WILSON assesses the Andriamparany effect.
EDINBURGH's annual Spring Fling festival is set for a wild and
tropical night on April 28. Sons et Couleurs is a five-hour feast of
art, music, dance, drag and fashion. The centrepiece will be a catwalk
show of new fashions by Andriamparany a Madagascan-born designer who
came to Edinburgh five years ago looking for inspiration.
Andriamparany first showed his clothes in the flat of an Edinburgh
friend. ''She asked all her friends to come to see my collection. At the
end of the day everything was sold,'' says Andriamparany (Parany, for
short). ''I really liked Edinburgh and the hills reminded me of
Madagascar.''
The Sons et Couleurs event is being organised by Parany -- whose
fashion heroes include Karl Lagerfeld and Thierry Mugler -- merging
fashion with the performing arts. ''I have tried to mix Scottish tartan
with my multi-cultural background,'' says Parany who studied fashion
design in Paris.
''The colours in this collection are saffron yellow, bright lime green
and very dark red. I see the show as a platform for young Scottish
designers and jewellery makers most of whom don't want to go to London
or Milan but want to stay and work in Scotland.''
Parany's tartan, printed on cotton, offers a thrilling culture clash
when teamed with batik and African patterns. It's superbly light and
ideal for hot summer weather or just for lounging about the house
pyjama-style. Outfits are adorned with jewellery in pewter foil and
blown glass, something of a rarity in modern jewellery-making, by Nikki
Cannon. There's also beautiful hand-painted silk, blurs of gold, pink
and blue, from Lucy Ross.
Parany has visions of a future annual Scottish fashion week. In 1992
he participated in the Spring Fling Fashion Express at Edinburgh's
Theatre Workshop. He hopes that this year's event may attract the
interest of manufacturers and retailers. The catwalk show includes men's
and women's wear -- jackets, skirts, trousers and shirts.
The Sons et Couleurs event takes place on April 28, 7pm-midnight at
the Assembly Rooms in George Street, Edinburgh (Tickets #6).

KEVIN COSTNER should take out a patent on epic. It's the only word
which truly captures his ambition and projects. As he waits for the
reaction to his $200 million dollar science-fiction extravaganza
Waterworld which, despite doomwatchers, has the potential of Dances With
Wolves, he has startled Hollywood by signing a new deal -- for
television.
Now, Oscar-winning superstars, especially actor/directors, do not
normally switch from big to small screen at the height of their careers.
But The Kentucky Cycle is a little different. It covers 200 years of
American history in the planned six-hour mini-series for Home Box Office
(HBO) cable, which will be cyndicated worldwide. Costner will produce,
direct and star in what is being regarded as one of 1995's grand
undertakings.
HBO's Bob Cooper, who helped close the arrangements with Costner, is
sure that: ''In a business of superlatives this is an amazing day in the
history of television.''
Costner sounded less secular about the project, adapted from Robert
Schenkkan's Pulitzer prizewinning play: ''The ideas and the feelings
were so strong that I know this was the voice I was waiting to hear when
it came to directing again,'' he said.
Meanwhile, Interplay Productions have endorsed Costner's Waterworld.
Certain it will be a box office monster, they have bought the rights to
produce video and strategy games based on what they call ''a great
story, rich universe and amazing visuals.''
Babe watch: Pamela Anderson starts work next week starring as comic
book heroine Barb Kopetski -- aka Barb Wire in a film of that title.
She's a bounty hunter and nightclub owner who, in line with the genre,
will combat ''diverse and colourful forces of evil''.
Whether you nearly wear a swimsuit or not in this type of endeavour is
still, as it were, to be revealed. But possibly it's premature to
disdain -- the producers were responsible for The Mask and Jim Carrey's
high profile which, with Dumb and Dumber has made him the multi-million
dollar man-of-the-movie-moment. Baywatch Pam may be next.
Blonde watch: Kim Basinger's delighted with the prospect of motherhood
in November. She and husband Alec Baldwin are already nursery shopping.
But their good news now has director Robert Altman searching for a
replacement for his gangster movie Kansas City. Basinger was happy to
work, believing it would not endanger her pregnancy, but the film's
insurance executives did not agree.
You must remember this: The 1940 Buick Phaeton in which Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman made their fateful journey to 'Casablanca' airport will
be auctioned in New York on June 28. No one is worried about the mileage
on the clock and the expected price seems modest at $80,000. The suit
and the car could never make a beautiful friendship.

Dennis Canavan argues that Labour's priority now should be the
presentation of policies that will win the hearts and minds of the
electorate
THE Scottish Labour Party is on cloud nine. We have just won control
of over two-thirds of the new Scottish councils. The Scottish Tories
have suffered a wipeout from a political map which they themselves
gerrymandered. The once great Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party,
the only party since the Second World War to have won over 50% of the
Scottish vote at a General Election, has been humiliated. ''Virtual
elimination'' is the verdict of Donald Findlay, Queen's Counsel and
erstwhile Tory loyalist.
The mood of optimism among Labour activists is such that there is even
talk of winning the Perth and Kinross by-election. Next month the Labour
Party looks set for another historic victory in the local elections
south of the Border. The Tories are divided and discredited. An
increasing number of people are looking to Labour as the only party
capable of forming an alternative government.
Given those circumstances, it is a rather strange priority to be
convening a special Labour Party conference in a week's time to indulge
in yet another bout of introspection. Our enemy is in a state of
complete disarray but, instead of going for the jugular, we are being
asked to contemplate our own navels. The leadership may be confident of
winning the conference vote, but the cost of victory may be the
disillusion of many of the foot soldiers who form the backbone of any
successful campaign.
We are told we must modernise and that a modern party needs a modern
constitution. Few, if any, would argue against adding to the party
constitution specific commitments to principles such as racial equality,
gender equality, and full employment. Their omission from the original
Clause IV was one of the principal arguments used by those who supported
re-drafting, but the actual re-draft falls far short of such specific
commitments. Back in the 1950s, even the Tory Party had a manifesto
commitment to ''ensure full employment''.
Yet opponents of Clause IV now insist that it must go because it is a
recipe for a Stalinist command economy. If they really believe that,
then I wonder how they managed to stretch their consciences to sign
their names under Clause IV on their party membership cards!
I do not know of any Labour Party member who does not believe in a
mixed economy. There may be differing views about the precise mix -- but
it is a gross distortion of Clause IV to claim that it calls for
wholesale nationalisation.
Clause IV does not mention nationalisation. It refers to common
ownership, of which there are many forms. Take Scottish water, for
example. It is in common ownership but it is not, and never has been,
nationalised. One of the most successful campaigns by the Scottish
Labour Party in recent years was to stop the privatisation of Scottish
water. Part of the reason for the success of that campaign was that we
were able to point to the disastrous experience south of the Border,
where privatisation has meant increased charges, widespread
disconnections and fat cats in the water boards, laughing all the way to
the bank.
So Labour Party policy on Scottish water is quite clear: we are
committed to its common ownership. That used to be our policy in England
and Wales too -- but no longer. Now the Tories have sold off English and
Welsh water, the commitment to common ownership has been ditched. No
wonder there is widespread concern when there is such ambivalence about
the common ownership of such a basic necessity.
We often hear eloquent defences of public ownership of the Post Office
and British Rail by able Shadow Ministers like Robin Cook, Gordon Brown,
and Brian Wilson. We used to hear them doing likewise for gas,
electricity, and telecommunications -- but no longer.
In other words, the Shadow Cabinet appears to believe in common
ownership -- but only when it is the status quo. The Labour Party is
not, and never should be, the party of the status quo. We are, or should
be, the party of radical change, and part of that radical change should
be to restructure our economy so there exists a healthier balance
between private and public sectors.
Recent experience indicates that we cannot rely on market forces to
deliver the economic regeneration and the employment opportunities our
country needs. A dynamic, efficient, and accountable public sector,
working in partnership with a thriving private sector, is one of the
instruments which government can use to stimulate a modern economy. The
Government's privatisation programme has undoubtedly reduced the range
of economic instruments available to a future Labour Government.
Now is the time to re-affirm our belief in common ownership and public
enterprise. Privatisation is being increasingly exposed as a shabby
exercise in public asset-stripping, and a job creation scheme for
ex-Government ministers and their friends. The people of this country
are rightly livid when they see a gas industry which used to belong to
all of us being mismanaged by a cabal of directors who line their own
pockets with excessive salaries and share options, while cutting the
wages and jobs of their own workforce.
The principles of common ownership enshrined in the original Clause IV
are relevant, not only to the economy. They also helped to inspire the
founders of the National Health Service and the socialist pioneers who
ensured public investment in housing and education because they saw such
public enterprise as essential to improving the opportunities of working
people and their families. Is anyone seriously arguing that such
principles are no longer relevant as we move towards the 21st century?
The Labour leadership's determination to ditch Clause IV, and with it
any meaningful commitment to common ownership, raises suspicions of a
hidden agenda to shift the Labour Party further to the right, so we
become more like Owen's SDP, or Clinton's Democrats.
Some of Tony Blair's advisers certainly seem to be overly influenced
by people and events on the other side of the Atlantic. Even before
Blair was elected leader, there was a discernible trend in that
direction. When Neil Kinnock was first elected leader, I recall some of
his more euphoric lieutenants making ludicrous comparisons with the
Kennedy era in the States! Kinnock was about the same age as JFK when he
became party leader -- but there the comparison ends. Apart from
anything else, Kennedy did manage to win an election.
Neil Kinnock was a brilliant political opportunist. In his early days
he espoused every fashionable left-wing cause around. He astutely used
the left to get elected as leader, then proceeded to abandon virtually
every left-wing principle in a vain pursuit of power at any price.
Policies were replaced by slick imagery and empty rhetoric. Party
conferences became more and more like supporters' club gatherings. The
notorious pre-election rally at Sheffield in 1992 was the last straw --
a fitting valediction to one of the most flamboyant flops in the history
of the Labour Party.
The party is still suffering, to some extent, from the legacy of
Kinnock. Lacking the breadth of vision to accommodate diversification of
opinion, he surrounded himself with mediocre sycophants, some of them
still in influential positions.
The party decision-making process became increasingly centralised, and
delegates at party conference were expected to act as mere rubber
stamps. Dissent was equated with disloyalty and any hint of rebellion
was snuffed out by ruthless authoritarianism or by turning the issue
into a vote of confidence in the leadership.
Some of those centralising tendencies were curbed under the leadership
of John Smith, who was much more tolerant than his predecessor.
Unfortunately his leadership was brought to a tragic and premature end.
I cannot envisage John embroiling the party in an internal
constitutional debate at this crucial stage in the lead up to a General
Election.
Our priority now should be the presentation of policies which will win
the hearts and minds of the electorate. Instead, party headquarters
seems to be spending an inordinate amount of time on conference
arrangements and producing vague statements about aims and values.
Of course we believe in justice, liberty, equality, solidarity,
tolerance, and respect. But that's rather like saying we're all against
sin. What we must do now is translate those aims and values into
policies. We are a political party, not a philosophical debating
society; it is on our policies that the electorate will judge us.
I recall the early 1970s, when Harold Wilson was Leader of the
Opposition. He stomped the country delivering major speeches detailing
policy on a whole range of issues from education to North Sea Oil to
industrial democracy. He was setting the political agenda rather than
just reacting to events. That is what the Labour Party should be doing
now, instead of allowing a discredited, corrupt Government not only to
set the national agenda but also to influence the Opposition's agenda,
thereby shifting Labour's centre of gravity further and further to the
right.
When it comes to campaigning, the Labour Party's once radical
crusading spirit is in danger of being replaced by pusillanimity.
Opinion polls seem to have an inordinate influence on policy
formulation. Of course, politicians must take public opinion into
account, but true leadership should involve trying to lead public
opinion instead of following slavishly in its wake.
One of our firmest policy commitments is our plan for a Scottish
Parliament, the details of which are due largely to the efforts of the
Scottish Constitutional Convention. But proposals for constitutional
change, however welcome and necessary, are no substitute for the
policies we hope constitutional change will facilitate. Much more work
and campaigning needs to be done to develop and project policies and to
bring fresh ideas to fruition. For example, we need to hear more about
Gordon Brown's brainwave of a hi-tech university serving the needs of
industry.
And what about international affairs? Europe is centre stage -- but
there is a bigger world. This week saw the International Conference for
Renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Labour's contribution
to the debate has been rather thin, to say the least. Despite party
conference resolutions, the leadership is still reluctant to abandon the
''independent nuclear deterrent''. Has nobody told them the cold war is
over? Even some Tory MPs now have private misgivings about Trident
which, according to some estimates, will cost up to #30bn.
Re-diverting even a fraction of such resources could make a
significant contribution to the achievement of social justice in
education, housing, or the NHS. So could a more progressive system of
taxation. Even Denis Healey, when Shadow Chancellor, spoke of helping
the poor by squeezing the rich ''until the pips squeak''. Some of the
pipsqueaks in the present Shadow Cabinet make Healey and Wilson sound
like Communist revolutionaries.
Indeed, on some issues, our current Labour leaders are well to the
right of some of our church leaders. Anyone who doubts that should look
at some of the recent condemnations of nuclear weapons by church
representatives of various denominations. Will anything so radical
appear in Labour's next manifesto?
Of course, politicians do not have precepts handed down to them as
tablets of stone. They must always be prepared to reassess policies in
the light of changing circumstances, and to update them when necessary.
But those modernisers who are inclined to look across the Atlantic for
inspiration should remember that even the American Declaration of
Independence contains self-evident truths which are as relevant today as
they were when first written in 1776.
Clause IV is not nearly as old as that, but the mere passage of time
does not invalidate self-evident truths and basic principles. If the
Labour Party forgets that and goes for power at any price, then the
prize may turn out to be an illusion.
There is quite a difference between being in office and being in
power. Politics is about power, but the achievement of power is not an
end in itself. It is a necessary means towards the greater objective of
using power for the benefit of the people we represent.

BBC managers in London have been accused of neglecting Scotland for a
second time despite promises by the board of governors that they would
strengthen consultation procedures.
A decision to give UK-wide coverage of Labour's Clause 4 debate next
week means BBC Scotland has had to change scheduling for the Scottish
Liberal Democrats' party conference. The change next Saturday means a
debate on the Constitutional Convention will not now be screened live.
Mr Jim Wallace, the SLD leader, wrote to the BBC director-general, Mr
John Birt, yesterday saying the corporation should have stuck to
promises made by chairman Marmaduke Hussey after backing down over the
controversial Panorama interview with John Major.
However, Mr Colin Cameron, head of TV at BBC Scotland, insisted the
changes to transmission times for the Liberal Democrat conference had
been made in Glasgow.
He said: ''It is not a question of being forced to drop coverage of
the Liberal Democrat conference. They will receive the same amount of
time as originally planned -- it is the time of transmission that has
been delayed.''

Commission chairman rejects moves to legislate, but warns editors if
self-regulation fails
THE chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, Lord Wakeham,
yesterday committed himself to maintaining the freedom of the press in
Britain against attempts by ''illiberal liberals'' to regulate it.
The former Leader of the House of Lords has found himself under
pressure to persuade critics that the PCC is an effective watchdog of a
self-regulating press since he became chairman three months ago.
Yesterday, however, he told the annual lunch of the Scottish Press
Fund: ''I am convinced that if legislation were ever to be introduced,
it would not be because the PCC had failed the public. It would be
because we made a mistake in our handling of one or two of these issues
which aroused great controversy. That will not happen during my
chairmanship.''
He said that his one principal aim on his appointment was, ''to put
the maintenance of the self-regulatory system which governs the press
beyond the bounds of political debate''.
Lord Wakeham described the establishment of the PCC as ''a logistical
and political triumph'' and praised the development of the Code of
Practice.
''Mighty though these achievements are, however, I do not believe that
we are out of the woods quite yet,'' he warned.
He added: ''The system has been strengthened to deal with many of the
issues raised by our band of often self-righteous scrutineers. But
despite the fact that, in dealing with complaints from ordinary members
of the public the PCC is undoubtedly the most effective self-regulatory
system in existence, demand for legislation continues.''
Nevertheless, he said, the vast majority of complaints were resolved
within weeks, or days, and very few went for full adjudication. In
addition, complaints had increased by more than a third since the start
of the year.
''Ordinary people do believe that we are working better than ever
before. We must keep that up and ensure that the excellent work we do is
not destroyed overnight by another crisis of our own making,'' said Lord
Wakeham.
He added: ''The most effective way to fend off legislation is to build
up the confidence of the public and of politicians in us. We will do
that simply if: the PCC remains scrupulous in its application of the
code; the industry here in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom
remains rigorous in observing our adjudications; and I remain steadfast
in refusing to give instant reactions for the benefit of those seeking a
cheap soundbite.''
He referred to ''recent squalls which have recently rocked the boat of
self-regulation -- and led to fresh calls for legislation''.
''The squalls of course surround the thorny issue of 'the public
interest' in allowing the press, for example, to intrude into personal
matters and use subterfuge to obtain information. One commentator
described 'the public interest' in our Code of Practice as a 'loophole'.
For me, it is not a loophole -- it is the foundation stone on which our
work is built -- giving equal rights to privacy for individual members
of the public but also, vitally, upholding the equal rights of the press
to investigate and expose.
''I recognise that there are occasions on which stories which are
found to flout the industry's own Code of Practice will be defended by
an editor as being 'in the public interest'. I can assure you that the
Commission will be stinging in its criticism of such editors -- many of
whom, of course, do not have the Code of Practice written into their
contracts of employment.
''These occasions must become fewer and fewer in number. Each time the
Code is breached without any clear defence, the ability of newspapers to
perform their vital function of guarding the genuine public interest
will be weakened and the credibility of the entire press diminished.
''That cannot be tolerated. The public interest defence which the Code
of Practice provides is, to coin a phrase, our trusty shield against the
blunderbuss of statutory regulation. But public interest must mean
public interest as we define it -- and not whatever an editor might
believe interests the public.''
Lord Wakeham continued: ''The PCC will not survive if it ever becomes
common currency among public and politicians alike that it is merely a
public relations exercise by the press to stave off statutory
regulation. Political history is littered with gimmicks. We are not one,
but perceptions can be as real, and as deadly, as facts. The
Commission's continuing independence from the press must therefore be
unyielding.''
He also confirmed the appointment of Baroness Smith of Gilmorehill,
the widow of the former Labour leader John Smith, as one of four new
independent members of the PCC. The other three new members are: Lady
Browne-Wilkinson, a senior partner at one of London's leading firms of
solicitors; Sir Brian Cubbon, a former Permanent Secretary at the Home
Office and the Northern Ireland Office; and Lord Tordoff, a former
Liberal Democrat Chief Whip in the House of Lords.

IT has not often been the practice of this column over the years to
commend the Kirk's Church and Nation committee for the international
interests section of its report to the General Assembly. Too often in
the past it had been a catalogue of whines and unrealistic exhortations
for HM Government to do this, that, and the next thing about obscure
injustices in Upper Bogoland, to save the whale, and establish peace on
earth.
This year I am happy to commend the report as a thoughtful and
informative insight into two running sores on the international scene --
Rwanda and East Timor. The latter is an island off the tip of Indonesia
whose people have suffered terribly at the hands of Indonesia, to whom
Britain both sells arms and gives aid.
Although obscure (and even invisible on most maps) the scale of the
suffering from genocide and starvation is severe and merits our
attention -- which is what the report is trying to achieve. It also has
some perfectly proper things to say about the morality of selling arms
to the Third World and about the dubious practice of linking them to
aid.
The section on Rwanda is an excellent summary of what has gone on
there, particularly for those of us reading and watching news reports
who became deeply confused between Hutu and Tutsi and who was doing what
to whom. The report points out that the indigenous clergy of the
Christian churches have not come up smelling of roses, and that tragedy
might have been averted had warnings been heeded by the international
community.
The report does not spell out how its call for the international
community (including the UK) to promote ''the establishment of justice''
might be achieved. It will not be easy.
Yet conditions are better now than for a long time. There appears to
be a new realism among many Third World campaigners. For a long time
they were concerned to flail former colonial nations for any disaster
which occurred in their former colonies. If it was not insensitive
drawing of frontiers which divided tribal lands, it was exploitation in
the form of trade which was the cause of the conflict, not the murderous
conduct of hot-heads who chopped the other tribe to pieces (as in
Liberia only this week).
The bankrupting effect of tyrants who borrowed huge sums from Western
banks and then bought up huge caches of arms while their people starved,
was conveniently forgotten. It was all the fault of the banks for
exploiting them. Little mention was made of the systematic extirpation
of any form of post-colonial democracy.
The African practice of one-party states, run by a ''life president''
were polite euphemisms for dictatorships but no-one dared say so. Black
African leadership was a Good Thing and colonial practices were a Bad
Thing. Our news media fell into this politically correct line. Remember
UDI in Rhodesia? The ''wicked regime'' of Ian Smith was an anachronism
whose time was running out and it was a kindergarten compared with most
modern African states.
When Smith was finally persuaded to throw in the towel, we were
encouraged to think there was a democratic alternative -- even a choice
between cuddly Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe. Those who knew the country (and
the tribal head count) knew jolly well that it was a matter of months
before Mugabe would declare a one-party state (which he duly did), but
they were dismissed as reactionaries.
I could go on with with a catalogue of appalling abuses all round the
Black Continent. Western media for long ignored them, some from a wish
to say nothing bad about black African rule, others because they
couldn't care less. Neither response did Africa any favours. It began to
polarise opinion . Those of us who felt no particular love for African
culture were made to feel as if we were guilty for feeling that way and
responsible for all that followed colonial rule. I remember a Unitarian
minister who took this kind of line, at the height of Idi Amin's Ugandan
terror, refusing to lay any wrongdoing at the dictator's door. Our
government at the time were also pretty spineless and wrung their hands
while Amin wiped out the country's intelligentsia.
Meanwhile South Africa (whose blacks had the best standard of living
in the continent) was held up as some kind of Fourth Reich. Thankfully,
that era appears to be passing. However, millions have died in African
genocides and civil wars and are still dying. The answer, as I am sure
the Church and Nation committee would agree, is not to leave them to get
on with it. Nor will Gulf war-style interventions get us anywhere.
If we are not to abandon Africa like an international leper, riddled
with Aids, to ravage itself by civil war, famine, and pestilence, then
the former colonial powers must be encouraged to find solutions that are
both lasting and beneficial to those who are giving assistance. Dare I
suggest that this might involve a re-colonialisation -- this time an
economic one? The old colonial system brought stability. Its
disadvantage was that it was seen as paternalistic and its prosperity
was not shared with the indigenous Africans.
Well, tribalism or ''life-presidency'' or one-party states, are just
as paternalistic and they have not worked for Africa's good. Provided
the prosperity was shared, would it be so detrimental for parts of
Africa to be run from Brussels? Our tribes manage to live with it in
Scotland -- why should Africa be different?

ONE question raised by the recent debates on education was, ''Is it
true that smaller classes mean better teaching?''
In my opinion, as a former primary teacher, headmaster, and former
member of the education committee of the Educational Institute of
Scotland, there is no doubt that smaller classes mean more and better
teaching.
If we are trying to get back to a top primary teacher correcting 28
rather than 33 weekly essays, interpretations, written poems, the daily
correction of 10 spelling sentences, not to mention daily correction of
mathematics, then it goes without saying that a smaller number of
children in the class will get more and better teaching.
The small numbers in private schools classes, often under 20 children,
have an enormous advantage. This is what parents of children in these
schools are paying for.
If there is a surplus of teachers then let the Government say it
believes in education and reduce the maximum size of a class in the
primary school to, say, 30 children.
Pupil/teacher ratios are mostly farcical when a teacher is attempting
to teach 33 pupils in his/her class and yet the P/T ratios in the school
is 22. The number of deputy heads and ancillary teachers does not
lighten the load of the class teacher that much.
John Major does not fully realise what he is saying by his statement
that ''he hoped teachers would decide that their job was to be in the
classroom''.
In a large secondary school today about one-quarter of teachers do not
teach. I can remember the anguish of some exceptional class teachers
who, if they were to better themselves, had to accept promotion and
cease being a classroom teacher for half a day and become an
administrator/organiser.
One would think a maximum of six administrators would be required in a
secondary school. Let's get the rest back to the classroom with a
non-loss pay structure.
It has been said, ''Let's trust our teachers.'' Unfortunately it has
been shown that some teachers cannot be trusted with the education of
our children.
Continued projects in primary schools do teach some children, it is
called encouraging pupils to think for themselves. Children need to be
tested if they are learning: 20% of children will learn without too much
effort from the teacher, or despite the teacher, but the rest have to be
taught and to be seen to be learning.
The question has been posed about the moral values of the nation
today. To me, the biggest thing is to reintroduce discipline into our
primary schools. Since corporal punishment was abolished, nothing has
taken its place and the job of the teacher has become much more
difficult.
We need to set up, not sin-bins, but set-aside classes, into which can
be put disruptive children so that the rest of the children can get on
with their education. The majority should not suffer because of a
disruptive minority.
This of course will cost millions, but this is the price that should
be paid for abolishing corporal punishment. Some schools will need very
few additional teachers. Some will need many. Something needs to be done
to help the classroom teacher.

I AM sure most people in Great Britain share my view that the
precarious peace in Ulster is something to be preserved at almost any
cost. In spite of various rather dubious compromises and accommodations,
at least it is better than an endless cycle of killing. But not for John
Macleod (Brotherhood of blood, April 18).
With his usual lack of restraint, he finds an opportunity to indulge
in a spot of anti-popery regardless of any damage he might cause.
Does he know or care that the British Army went into Ulster in the
present phase of The Troubles to prevent Protestants indulging in a bout
of ethnic cleansing? Does he know that many non-Catholics support the
Irish Nationalist position?
Would he prefer the restoration of the status quo anti which would
give the anti-Catholic murder squads an excuse to resume their
indiscriminate murder of Catholics?
It goes against all my secular humanist instincts to say so, but the
man is a menace.

CONGRATULATIONS to Cappella Nova for their magical singing in St
Vincent de Paul Church, Thornliebank. For once, The Herald critic found
nothing to carp about. It was a truly ''exquisite'' evening (April 19).
My one criticism concerns not the singing but the haphazard appearance
of the ladies. While the men wore the usual unobtrusive black and white,
there was no uniformity in the dresses whatsoever, which I found very
distracting.
They ranged from wine to green, velvet to taffeta, patterned to plain,
and from bare-shouldered to jacketed, and all styles in between.
No-one likes to be dictated to in the matter of dress, but perhaps a
solution would be to settle for three different shades of the one colour
in a choice of two materials.
As for the style, well, as the ladies were so incredibly slim, there
should be no problem reaching agreement there.

NO wonder wild animals the world over suffer so much persecution and
unnecessary slaughter when people like Dan Buglass display such blind
prejudice against foxes (Menace of the fox, April 15).
Mr Buglass says, ''It is difficult to be precise about just how many
lambs are lost to foxes'', and he then goes on to suggest that a figure
of 10% is commonly accepted.
What rubbish. Thirty years of scientific research in Scotland,
England, Wales, and Northern Ireland indicate that even in the harshest
conditions foxes take only between 0.5% and 2% of lambs.
Postmortem evidence reveals beyond doubt that the majority of the tiny
number of lambs taken by foxes are the scavenged victims of stillbirths,
hypothermia, malnutrition, and disease.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food publishes the
following figures: nearly five million lambs die (around 18% of the
total lamb crop). Of this massive mortality, 40% is caused by abortion
and stillbirth, 30% by exposure and starvation, and 20% by infectious
diseases.
MAFF states that all predation (dogs, birds of prey, foxes, etc) and
all misadventure (accidents) only add up to 5% of lamb deaths -- less
that 1% of lambs produced.
As foxes are only responsible for a small part of this 1%, where does
Mr Buglass obtain his 10%?
Research by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
reveals an almost identical pattern. Independent research has shown that
killing foxes makes not difference to lambing success and certainly does
not lead to any overall reduction in fox numbers.
In view of these well-established facts, the Forestry Commission is
quite right not to heed the strident voices of prejudice and ignorance
which use wild animals as scapegoats for inadequate methods of livestock
husbandry.

THE photograph accompanying Aileen Little's article shows a large
group of mounted hunt followers -- evidence of the increasing modern-day
support for this traditional country sport (April 18).
More and more people are seeing beyond the emotional propaganda put
about by a small, vocal anti-field sport lobby and are finding the truth
that fox hunting is a well-regulated, honourable, and legal activity.
Hunt sabotage, on the other hand, is illegal.
We love our horses, our hounds, the countryside, and even our foxes,
although we share her recognition that the fox can be a villain in the
eyes of the farmer and gamekeeper. We care for the countryside and
delight in watching nature at work.
At times we witness the ancient art of venery overcome the quarry.
Other times that art is outfoxed by the fox.
That foxes are killed by humans in vast numbers is not disputed by
Aileen Little any more than the fact that humans kill flies, mice, or
rats. Indeed she says that Janet Marshall, chairwoman of the SSPCA, pays
people to shoot them on her land in Ayrshire.
Hunting does not claim to be the universal or most effective control.
But it remains the least cruel and most natural method of control --
short of reintroducing the wolf, which has been rather bizarrely
suggested recently.
John McFall's Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill to outlaw cruelty towards
wild animals would succeed if it recognised that properly controlled
field sports share this aim. Indeed they foster it. Many of us support
the SSPCA's good works, although we do not agree with the society's
misguided stance on field sports.
Those who must take the blame for such an otherwise worthy Bill being
so fragile in Parliament are the zealots -- the animal rightists -- who,
being unsuccessful in treating their fellow human beings with dignity
and respect, seek to give rights to animals which are equal to or exceed
those of humans.

IT was most encouraging to read your excellent account (March 11) of
the case of Ian Hay Gordon, and to read the forthright letter you
published (March 24) from Mr Hugh Pierce, the barrister whose
involvement helped so substantially to bring about Mr Gordon's release.
My late mother, Mrs Dorothy Turtle, was also one of several people who
became convinced that Iain Gordon was the victim of a miscarriage of
justice, and worked with the Gordon family, Mr Pierce and others, for Mr
Gordon's release, and in the hope of seeing his name cleared.
Indeed, the more one considers the facts of the case, the clearer it
became that a miscarriage of justice had occurred. It is deplorable that
there seems to be no mechanism to put right what, to us, is obviously
wrong.
In the absence of such mechanism, the fine programme shown by the BBC
in Northern Ireland about Iain Gordon's case, followed by your own
extensive coverage of it, are essential in sustaining our hope that
right will prevail in the end and that Mr Gordon will succeed in
clearing his name.

MANY politicians here are berating the Americans as being barbaric
because a majority believe in capital punishment. But surely it cannot
be undemocratic to accede to the wishes of 75% of the American
electorate -- to the voice of the people?
According to polls, 70% of the British electorate wish to see the
return of capital punishment. So is it democratic to accede to the
wishes of 30%?
MPs adopt a holier-than-thou attitude and reject calls for a
referendum on the subject. They only favour a referendum when it suits
their political aspirations or bias.

THE Conservative Party in Scotland has been stunned by the extent of
its losses in this month's local government elections. What little
debate the debacle has stimulated among the dwindling band of party
faithful has been largely directed towards identifying scapegoats. It
should hardly need saying that Sir Michael Hirst is no more to blame
than any other member of his party. He merely happened to be in the
wrong position at the wrong time. Conservative councillors who lost
their seats in the elections were the victims of the Government's
nationwide unpopularity. The same fate awaits those who stand under the
Tory banner next month in England and Wales. It is late in the day for
the Conservative Party to cobble together a strategy to resurrect its
fortunes in time for the next General Election, which is less than two
years away at the most. It may be tempted to change the leader in the
hope of finding a Prime Minister with a safer pair of hands and a
greater ability to inspire confidence. But in reality politics is as
much about policy as it is about politicians. That is a test that the
opposition parties as well as the Government face.
Last night the MP for Eastwood, Allan Stewart, took advantage of his
new-found freedom on the back benches to open up a debate about
policies, designed to bring about a Tory revival. Ironically he would
not have been in a position to do so but for the alleged pick-axe
incident which led to his resignation as a senior Scottish Office
Minister. His intervention is not without self-interest. The
Conservatives lost control of the new East Renfrewshire authority, set
up specifically to create a greater Eastwood and rule over areas
formerly under Labour control. Mr Stewart now finds himself in danger of
losing his own seat, though by any standards it is the ''safest'' his
party has north of the Border. However, he deserves credit for fighting
back as he has done in the past. His 10-point strategy for revival
indicates a striking dissatisfaction with the policies of the Government
from one who was so recently a Minister in it.
It would be wrong to dismiss Mr Stewart's agenda as the antics of a
man seeking to save his political bacon. He has close ties with the
Prime Minister and is in a position to exercise influence, as he
undoubtedly did in the devolution debate after the 1987 General
Election. Some of what he says is populist, worryingly so in the case of
his call for a national flying squad to put the tabs on demonstrators.
Some of it is common sense, notably his insistence that VAT on domestic
fuel should be frozen at the present rate. He could be pushing at an
open door on this one. The revenues foregone when the Government was
defeated on its plans to increase the rate to the full 17.5% were easily
and relatively painlessly made up elsewhere. One problem with a
manifesto commitment on VAT is that it would lack credibility. Mr
Stewart's plea to reverse the cuts made in mortgage tax relief,
doubtless an appealing measure to the good people of Eastwood, is more
dubious. It would be at the expense of other tax cuts the Chancellor of
the Exchequer might be able to engineer now that public borrowing is
being reduced to manageable proportions, and it is by no means clear
that it would restore confidence in the housing market.
One of the Conservative Party's greatest weaknesses is the division in
its ranks over Europe. Mr Stewart is keen to bring the nine Tory rebels
back to the fold, keep the pound floating on the foreign exchange
markets, steer clear of a single currency, and resist further moves
towards qualified majority voting in Europe. He might have been one of
the rebels had he been on the back benches at the crucial time. These
are all issues his party will have to resolve, but if it is to be taken
seriously as a governing party it cannot afford to become too obviously
in hock to its Euro-sceptic wing. Mr Stewart has done a service to his
party by speaking his mind. Others in all parties should follow his
lead.

FEW words match the poetry of the Bordeaux classification of 1855,
which ranked the wines of the Medoc according to the price they had
fetched for up to a century. ''Chateau Beycheville'', we recite to
ourselves, ''Chateau Marquis d'Alesme-Becker''. These are not wines of
the first growth, of course. Premier Crus like Chateau Lafite-Rothschild
or Chateau Haut-Brion are for the boardrooms of public utilities, not
for the likes of us. Nevertheless, it would be a pity, when we are rich,
if a sommelier thought we were unaccustomed even to clarets of the
fourth and fifth ranks . . . ''Chateaux Croiset-Bages'', we murmur,
''Chateau Grand-Puy-Lacoste''.
With a few official additions, such rankings have stood for 150 years.
There are mutinous noises from time to time, of course. In 1959 the late
Alexis Lichine proposed a new classification for the whole of Bordeaux.
Even now, in San Francisco, millionaire Gordon Getty has caused outrage
among French wine producers by publishing a list that removes Chateau
Latour and Lafite from top of the list and replaces them with
Pichon-Longueville and Lynch-Bages. It goes without saying that it will
not succeed. The 1855 classification may err here and there, but at
least it is based on the well-established choice of French bon-viveurs,
voting with their pocket books.
These days, alas, a liking for fine wine is a taste that most of us
can afford only in later life. It offers many consolations, however. A
library of rare books may be a cultural asset, as is a collection of
porcelain or rare coins. Yet it is difficult to escape the conviction
that our treasures will fall under the auctioneer's hammer as soon as we
are gone. One recalls the dying Cardinal Mazarin, shuffling round his
treasures to bid them a last farewell. A wine cellar is entirely
different. A twinge in the chest, a shortness of breath, and one can
start opening the best bottles immediately, preferably in the presence
of predatory heirs. It is a fanciful notion, of course. Few of us now
have cellars, and our expertise centres on #2.99 Chilean reds, or
comparing Sicilian whites with those of the New World. Still . . . there
is no harm in wishful thinking. ''Chateau Branaire-Ducru'', we murmur,
''Chateau Cantenac-Brown . . .''

Tokyo, Friday
A POISON gas attack sent Japan into a panic for the third time today
amid signs that police were close to acting against a doomsday cult
linked to an attack one month ago on the Tokyo subway.
In the latest incident, 25 people were taken to hospital after being
overcome by fumes in a Yokohama store, a change of target from the two
previous attacks on Japan's rail system.
The Vivre 21 department store is only 300yd from Yokohama's main
railway station where many of 500 people stricken by gas on Wednesday
were been waiting for trains.
Doctors said the store victims had the same symptoms -- though not as
severe -- as those in Wednesday's attack, complaining of sore throat,
burning eyes, and nausea.
''It's very scary. I thought Wednesday's incident could not repeat
itself,'' said a 20-year-old college student. ''Now I know it could
happen again and again. I don't want to think about it.''
Police have ruled out sarin, the nerve gas used in the March 20 Tokyo
subway attack that killed 12 people and injured more than 5000, in both
Yokohama incidents.
The Tokyo attack has been the main target of investigation with the
religious sect Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth Sect) emerging as the main
suspect.
Police raids on sect facilities have uncovered all the ingredients
needed to make sarin.
In a sign of growing public impatience with failure to solve the case,
the country's acting police chief told an emergency meeting of regional
heads of police to speed up their investigation into the sect.
Yuko Sekiguchi said the investigation was at a turning point. ''We
have to tear down the thick walls surrounding the case and disclose the
entire allegations,'' he said. ''At home and abroad, people are
concerned about Japan's domestic security.''
Sekiguchi has headed the investigation since his chief Takaji
Kunimatsu was shot four times outside his home, 10 days after the subway
attack.
Kyodo news agency said police were in the final stages of preparing
charges against the sect, believing they had enough evidence to firmly
link the group to the manufacture of sarin.
''If we don't solve this case at any cost, legal order will
collapse,'' Kyodo quoted a senior police official as saying.--Reuter.

CAN'T you detect a hankering to suggest that the American people
somehow brought the Oklahoma bombing on themselves? Like those Tory MPs
still smouldering at the red carpet welcome for Gerry Adams in
Washington who dashed off billet-doux, tabled Commons motions of
sympathetic humbugerry, while saving the real regret for the conclusion.
Nicholas Winterton's waspish sting in the tale of his ''sorrow,
horror, and anger'' at the attack was to regret that the President had
given credibility to terrorists in Sinn Fein, who had been responsible
for the deaths of so many innocent men, women, and children in Northern
Ireland.
Read those sentiments alongside the images of horror, the firefighter
finding a child's finger and an American flag amid the broken walls; the
terrible noises of grief from those who search for their lost children,
and tell me the Tories have not taken leave of whatever senses they are
alleged to have left. To borrow an American phrase, because it's
apposite, they suck.
They may well be joined in their tit for bloody tat view by the
millennialists, the religious right, and TV evangelists of that confused
nation who will use the outrage to spout retributive sermons about
divine chastisement sent by God for the nation's sins.
Liberals and secular outsiders make the mistake of forgetting the
extent to which the US is a Christian country. Religion is not mere
repetition.
The regular public recitation of the line ''one nation indivisible
under God'' is a far more reliable clue to the national psyche than our
renditions of God Save the Queen. One is habit, the other imploration.
Noam Chomsky argues that the US is remarkable among industrial
societies in its irrationality. Three-quarters of the population believe
in religious miracles. You would have to go to mosques in Iran or poll
old ladies in Sicily to get numbers like this, he points out. A recent
poll on evolution showed the percentage of the population that believes
in Darwinian evolution is just 9%.
The distressing manifestation of the American century -- McCarthyism
and the tendency to invade smaller nations following different creeds --
might be understood as politics blackened by the intolerance and
evangelism to which religions tend.
This was a nation encouraged by its leaders through two centuries to
believe it is especially blessed. It has dictated the shape of American
values. The morality follows from the Godliness. That may seem unlikely
to hold in cosmopolitan New York. But it plays, as they say in Peoria,
in middle America.
UNTIL now, the US has been remarkably free from political terrorism.
The convulsions of fear gripping America may be due to the dawning
realisation that they are not, after all, especially safe in the arms of
Jesus; that they are as much at risk from the new danger from random
terrorists, if that is what the perpetrators of the Oklahoma outrage
turn out to be, as are the rest of us. The threat is global.
The days when terrorist groups were easier to identify, their targets
specific, and their tactics comprehensible, are gone. The amateur
terrorists may have religious or quasi-religious motives, but they are
not linked to any organisation; they have no base, they raise their own
funds, attack soft targets and leave no footprints. They insinuate fear
by their invisibility.
In Yokohama, Japan, 370 people were rushed to hospital after toxic gas
was released on two trains. Last month 12 died when nerve gas was
released in the Underground.
The Oklahoma and Tokyo experiences raise serious questions about the
use of weapons of destruction by radical groups, presenting difficult
problems for state authorities. What use are conventional responses
against unconventional warfare?
Those terrorist groups, like the Red Brigades in Italy, the
Baader-Meinhof group in Germany and the IRA, have been a feature of the
political landscape in Europe for decades. They had a defined political
agenda.
Against the unknown, the only credible response to thwart random
terrorism would seem to be defensive. But, as they mop up the blood,
pick up the bits of bodies entombed in concrete in Oklahoma, there is
another likely option. That a nation will turn in on its own.
''We are a people that under threat can take extraordinary measures
against foreigners seen as dangerous,'' warned a veteran of the US
intelligence committee, Dr Alexander Codevilla. ''Remember the way we
interned tens of thousands of Japanese Americans in the Second World
War?''
America's sudden vulnerability offers the prospect of a new mission
and a new role for those who want to hold to the belief that it remains
God's own country.

I WAS on holiday, the sun was shining, and I was feeling rather
chirpy. It was too good: something had to go wrong. Just then, as if to
prove me right, the borrowed car I was driving proceeded to shed a large
bit of exhaust.
It took an extensive bit of fumbling round the Sierra's undercarriage
before I could head off to the nearest town to get the car fixed. Five
miles up the road, however, the car felt that the holiday weekend had to
be ruined a bit more, and it came to a halt.
So I found myself on the main road into Leven, sitting waiting for the
AA to rescue me. I had naively decided that the estimated waiting time
of 90 minutes must be a cunning PR ploy, designed to elicit joy and
gratitude when the man appeared 20 minutes later. No chance. It was, in
fact, a remarkably accurate prediction.
Breaking down on a busy road must be the modern-day equivalent of
being put in the stocks. If you're at a busy junction, as I was, it
gives everybody the opportunity to slow down and gawp in, contemptuous
of your predicament. Even the dogs sneered as they passed, and just to
ensure the complete erosion of my self respect, I was then scooshed on
the head by two eight-year-old boys with the water-gun equivalent of the
Uzi 9mm. I should have laughed, but it was so much easier just to swear.
All experienced drivers recognise the importance of ensuring other
road users are made aware of any breakdown. For this I recommend the
tried and tested signals:
* Gesticulating Loudly While Kicking Each Of The Wheel Trims In Turn.
This was only recently incorporated into the Highway Code, and is
considered useful only if weather conditions are reasonable. Good for
Italians.
* Flashing The Hazard Warning Lights. Overuse has now made this
ineffective when used alone. FTHWL used to mean ''It would appear that
I've broken down. Please make arrangements to avoid colliding with this
stationary vehicle.'' It has now come to mean merely ''Up yours, chum,
I've just popped in to return this video and you'll just have to wait.''
Occasionally, for the Fiesta driver telling Betty about the new skirt
she got from Marks and Spencer, something a bit more dramatic is called
for. For that reason, in order to dissipate the queue of menopausal
women, I had to resort to . . .
* Lifting The Bonnet. Not even one of those spotty gits in an ''E''
reg XR3i with the Earl's Court sound system for a stereo would drive
with the bonnet up, so this message is universally recognised. It does
have the disadvantage of impeding the constant peering out for the
yellow van.
Waiting for the AA man evokes what psychiatrists call a ''Modified
Grief Reaction''. Like bereavement, the vigil takes you on what sports
commentators call an emotional roller-coaster. First comes Resignation.
(''Ah well, I'll just buy a snack from the garage''), then Anxiety
(''It's taking a while. Has he got lost?''), then Boredom (''At its
worst will make you want to go to a pub in Leven), Denial (''No officer,
I don't know what's wrong'') then, finally, Irritation.
The last is the most prolonged phase, as you've usually passed through
the others by the time you're back at the car unwrapping the prawn
cocktail sandwiches. The irritation quickly evolves into Fury, peaking
seconds before the yellow van arrives.
Psychologists have discovered the reason why most men hate waiting for
the AA. First, and most importantly, you feel you've paid a fortune to
this shower of gaudy yellow cowboys and all they can do is spend it on
adverts saying they're as important as the police.
This increases the anger until the driver begins to believe he
deserves special treatment. So what if others are on the way to hospital
to carry out a kidney transplant? It's important for the ''A bloody A''
to realise that I'm on holiday, my exhaust has fallen off, and now my
car has juddered to a complete halt.
By this stage I could easily picture over the country a thousand women
simpering into the phone and getting the AA man in for any old rubbish.
It's their fault, my soul cried, but me, I've broken down!
Then all those adverts for the AA's driving school begin to irk even
more. Why has the AA got a driving school anyway? By definition, the AA
is full of people who can already drive. If it was the other AA that ran
a driving school, that'd be more impressive: ''Nice try, Steve. Bit of a
shame that the car nosedived into the canal. I think the manoeuvre you
should have tried was 'Hailing A Taxi With The Hand Not Holding The
Kebab'.''
Anyway, after 15 minutes' wait I had convinced myself that what was
needed was a motoring organisation that only allowed real men to join --
the Macho Drivers' Association. Instead of just whingeing when road tax
went up, the MDA would send someone round to sort the Chancellor out.
When petrol went up in price, the MDA would only complain if its
members didn't have as much free cash to spend at Ladbrokes. Never mind
this ''Fourth Emergency Service'' bull, the slogan would be: ''The MDA
-- Are You Looking At My Bird?''. The main benefit would be a much
quicker recovery service, because they wouldn't have to traipse round
the country fixing punctures, repairing fan belts, or giving cannisters
of fuel to those women too stupid to read a fuel gauge.
Invariably, just at the point where your mind is set to explode with
sheer fury, the yellow van arrives. No matter how fed up you were, some
strange inborn reflex makes you jump out of the car smirking, and
adopting body language meaning ''Here already?''.
Last Friday, once he got there, he cheerfully started looking the car
over. He quickly found the problem, and within a few minutes I was on my
way back home.
As I drove off into the sunset, I was just happy that the car was
still working, and that I didn't have to spend too long in Leven.
What? Oh, you want to know what was wrong with the car? Well it's a
long story, but . . . em, you see, some of the electrics were a bit
faulty, and some of the gauges weren't working, and the car just, er,
stopped.
The man was very nice about it, though, especially considering he'd
driven 45 miles just to give me a can of petrol. Whoops!
* With his car now working, JP will be able to drive to his gig at the
Tron on Sunday at 8pm. He might even give a lift to Ford Kiernan and
Maria Falzone, but only if they give him some petrol money.

ON the night the Armani Fashion show came to town I thought: ''Stone
me, I'm in a 9.30pm sitcom.'' Absolutely Fabulous might have been locked
on the telly at the time but Patsy and Edina were present in spirit, if
not spirits, the plural being much more to their sumptuous style. The
air was heavy with missed kisses, men preened and posed, and the women
walked like scissors. The image was all.
In comparison, in my best black suit, I looked more like a drowned cat
than Reservoir Dog, but then Misty Oldland strolled on stage and added
extra depth to the shallow end of the fashion pool. Not only did she
look great, thanks to the loan of a #7000 besequinned jacket, but the
appearance was a trailer for her talent. As a former fashion model
turned melodic story teller, she can now display her voice's style and
skill.
After the deafening din of dance music, Oldland offered aural relief
and the hint of a swagger as she wandered -- yes, cool enough even to
wander a postage-stamp stage -- and sang a brief selection of singles
including A Fair Affair. It was short, sweet, and to the point which was
if you've got it flaunt it, but looks will fade while music continues to
shine. Those with the looks flaunted it down the front, those without
talent should have taken notes.
And those who wanted to see Lisa Moorish had a long wait for a short
show, well less a show than a brief performance of two bubbly pop
singles. Around midnight the London-born singer, who is making a stab at
pop-like rythmn and blues, sang a little too swiftly and left. After the
two acts it was a relief, now the dancers could go back to looking at
each other. That's style.

Despite all the traps of the media camp followers who recognised
immediately they had a star in their midst, not once has she slipped
into ranting hatred
Judy
TWO years ago that grand old pantomime dame of Tory party conferences,
Laura Norder, was given a sudden and startling facelift. The paradox of
Judy's particularly sweet face personifying the most violent and
degrading sexual assault gave her words an immediate and overwhelming
power.
It wasn't just that she might have been the daughter, wife, or sister
of anyone in the hall, she was the kind of daughter, wife, or sister
they would like to have. She would fit perfectly any blueprint drawn up
by Conservative Central Office for the model Tory wife.
A mother of four who had shelved her own career for her maternal
duties and support for her husband's career, she was the embodiment of
the traditional family values which were then at the forefront of their
policy statements. Better than that, she had a community conscience,
speaking not just for herself but for all the victims of such crimes and
their families.
Anyone who thought then that her performance was inspired solely by
politics should consider subsequent events. Courage and a passion for
justice are the stuff of life for this woman. She made a private visit
to Peterhead Prison -- where the man who attacked her was imprisoned --
to learn about their intervention programme for sex offenders.
Alex Spencer, the governor, describes her as ''an inspiration''. Like
many people, he wanted to write to her after her Edinburgh speech, but
felt it would be jumping on a bandwagon. When a mutual acquaintance put
them in touch, he invited her to visit the prison if she wanted to.
''Very courageously and very unusually for a victim, she did come on a
private visit and a number of my staff explained the sex offender
intervention policy and some of the theory behind it and -- with the
prisoners all well out of the way -- she saw some of the rooms used for
the programme.
''Obviously her viewpoint is subjective in that she has feelings about
what happened to her but she is able to look at issues in a much more
detached way and take an almost objective view,'' he said.
That visit is the most extreme example of her very practical
philosophy that we can understand only by learning from one another. In
the past two years while consciously and deliberately ''leading as
normal a life as possible in the circumstances,'' she has identified for
herself a unique role as interpreter to those who work in the criminal
justice system how it affects those caught up in it as victims.
''I am anxious that the system is improved. I am willing to talk to
people because it is the only way they can learn. Although they work in
the criminal justice system, they do not know how it is working unless
they are at the receiving end of it. It is the same with the NHS, unless
you are a patient you don't know how it feels to be sitting there. It is
unfortunate that people have to learn the hard way,'' she says.
She now lives in England. Recent speculation that the move was
prompted by fear that her attacker might trace her was plain wrong. This
woman does not run away. On the contrary she continued to live with her
children in the house where she was attacked while her husband's career
took him to England.
Now that the transition has been made, she says: ''Probably we would
have moved sooner, but I simply was not physically ready for the
upheaval. Now that we are all together in a new house, it is a new
beginning, but he has not intimidated me. I am not running away. I am
concerned that it might appear that he has succeeded. It is not that, it
is just that we are ready for a quiet life now.''
Despite world-wide interest at the time of the party conferences and a
genuine willingness to speak up for victims, she has avoided becoming a
media patsy or rent-a-quote whenever the subject of sexual assault crops
up. That is something defence counsel Donald Findlay pays tribute to.
Their meetings on public discussion programmes also left him with a very
favourable impression of her reasonableness. ''There are others who
campaign on legal issues without fully understanding the arguments, but
she understood why I would disagree with her,'' he said.
Now that television brings us constant reports of human tragedies
accompanied by distraught relatives, who have spent several nights
without sleep, we have become inured to the vengeful streak in human
nature revealed by personal hurt. Despite all the traps of the media
camp followers who recognised immediately they had a star in their
midst, not once has she slipped into ranting hatred. Extraordinarily,
she has become the voice of reason.
It is a light voice with the intonation of the educated Scot which
makes it neutral in the class system south of the Border. Having said
she has done her public bit and wants to retreat from the limelight to
get on with the rest of her life, she returns calls from journalists
with the friendly politeness which is the hallmark of people at ease
with themselves.
Yet she is cautious, repeating that she has decided to keep a lower
profile. An unsubstantiated claim this week that a threatening letter
sent to a tabloid newspaper was written by her attacker is treated with
caution but no panic, but the family will take extra precautions. So
with hindsight would she do it again?
''I don't regret what I have done. By me standing up and doing what I
did it gives the message that women who have not done anything wrong
have nothing to be ashamed of. I was spurred to action because I was so
disgusted at the way the criminal justice system works. I simply had no
idea of life beyond that conference. It was intended simply to be a
one-off. That may sound naive, but I honestly do not think that anyone
else had foreseen what was going to happen.''
For all its emotion, that speech to the Scottish Conservatives in
Edinburgh was unwavering. That, Judy says now, was a brave front.
''Because I took a public stance I could not let him see me standing up
there as a crumbling wreck, but a large part of it was a facade.''
Although she had been active in local government, she says she had
never made a speech from a platform before and was intensely nervous.
She can still remember the emotionally charged atmosphere.
''I was told later by someone who had been at the back of the hall
that the silence spread from the front. Usually there is chitter-chatter
at conferences but it got quieter and quieter until everyone was
concentrating on listening and I could feel the audience almost urging
me through it with their support.''
Despite great concern expressed by several people close to her about
the media exposure and the resultant flatness when she would be
abandoned for the next topic, she made the decision to speak again at
the main Conservative conference in Blackpool. That was the trigger for
her researches into the criminal justice system, not only in Scotland
where she now had some first-hand knowledge, but in the UK as a whole.
There is a modest chuckle when she agrees that she is now very
knowledgeable about the criminal justice system. The professionals with
whom she has shared her experiences for educational purposes all list
three recurring qualities: the amount of homework she has done in
learning about the system, her objectivity, and her courage.
Quietly she has had two meetings with the Home Secretary, Michael
Howard, and has been credited with significant input into his new
guidelines for judges in rape cases. She has also been involved in
training sessions for the judiciary -- something she called for in her
original speech.
Detective Superintendent Alec Brown, who has responsibility for the
Women and Child Unit in Lothian and Borders Police, says that in
speaking of her experiences at training courses, she has become so
knowledgeable about police procedures that they have found her comments
to be very applicable. ''She is very practical,'' he added.
That practicality has already produced some real benefits. Alison
Paterson, director of Victim Support Scotland, said: ''What brought her
to us was her concern about the lack of information available about the
criminal justice system and that the help and support which is available
is not widely known. Largely due to her input we have been able to
produce a booklet for victims of sexual crimes in Scotland which is a
very positive step forward.''
At the launch of the booklet recently, Scottish Office Minister Lord
Fraser said the Government fully accepted the argument for victims to be
informed of progress on their cases. It seems likely that the #100,000
increase on funding for Victim Support Scotland announced at the same
time was also due to the impact she made.
Perhaps the practicality is due to her training as a microbiologist.
She claims the only questions which faze her are the political ones
because she never expects them.
As for that now indelible Mother Courage image: was it always there in
waiting, was she naturally brave? Not bravery, but a strong personality,
she suggests. ''I was just so determined that this was not going to ruin
our lives.''

COURTROOM television links have provided ''peace of mind'' to both
children and parents where the children have had to give evidence, but
the concept needed to be developed further, according to a new study.
The scheme was initially regarded with caution, and the majority of
children continued to give evidence in open court. However, those who
had used the TV link said it had helped overcome fear of confronting the
accused in the court.
''Parents and children were themselves very clear that the live
television link made a huge difference to their peace of mind before the
trial, and many parents said they would not have wanted their children
to testify if it had not been available,'' the researchers said.
The study was carried out by Glasgow University's Centre for the Child
and Society and based on 70 cases involving 144 children between 1991
and 1993, where applications were made to use the link.
The researchers said the main problems encountered lay not with the
technology but with court procedures: ''The worst experiences for both
parents and children included the long delay between the report of the
offence and the trial, re-interviews by a variety of professionals, the
absence of choice, limited information about the availability of a live
television link and the paucity of support services available to the
victims and their families.''
Evidence given on the link was viewed by lawyers and judges as
somewhat artificial and inferior to witnesses appearing in court.
However, this inadequacy was often compounded by inexperience of lawyers
in their questioning techniques and confused recollection caused by the
length of time in bringing cases to court.
''While the introduction of the new procedure appeared to lessen the
worst of the ordeal of testifying for most children who use it, often
their evidence was unconvincing and lacked the detail and consistency
necessary to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt,'' the
researchers said.
There were no indications that TV links were responsible for any
unfairness to the accused and no-one suggested abandoning the idea.
''Rather, it was widely believed that intensive efforts are required
to reduce delays, to sharpen skills and to remedy the imperfections in
the system that can interfere with the accuracy and effectiveness of all
children's testimony,'' the study concluded.
* The research was based on trial schemes in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
The Scottish Office has since extended live TV links to all sheriffdoms.

Los Angeles, Friday
SEVERAL members of the jury in the O J Simpson double murder trial
rebelled today over the removal of three sheriff's deputies who had been
guarding the panel.
A court official said 13 members of the panel had initially refused to
leave their hotel to go to court. They demanded that a note be sent to
Judge Lance Ito asking him to come to the hotel and talk to them.
On being told this was not possible, the mutinous jurors agreed to be
taken to the courthouse, but said they would not enter the jury box
until they had talked to Ito.
At least 11 jurors came to court wearing black to protest the removal
of the deputies, who were yanked from their jury assignment last night
on Ito's orders after he interviewed a female black juror, a 25-year-old
flight attendant, who asked to be taken off the panel.
The jury mutiny again raised the spectre of a mistrial in the
celebrated case. The jury has been sequestered since January 11 --
virtual prisoners in their hotel -- and racial tensions are reportedly
rampant.
Six jurors have already left the panel and the pool of alternates has
dwindled from 12 to six. With the case proceeding at a snail's pace and
looking as though it could last another six months, the prospect of not
having enough jurors by the end of it looms large.
A Sheriff's Department spokesmen said officials from the department
would meet Ito. Court officials said they did not expect any testimony
to be heard while Ito dealt with the latest, and possibly the most
serious, crisis in a case beset with problems.
Former American football hero Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the
stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend,
Ronald Goldman on June 12, 1994.
The 25-year-old juror who asked to be released spoke to Ito in his
chambers after requesting a meeting.
According to a transcript of that conversation, she said she wanted to
be released from the panel ''because I can't take it any more''. She
added: ''It's just a combination of things throughout the last three
months.''
Serious troubles among jurors were brought to light last week when
dismissed juror Jeanette Harris went on television, saying the
panellists were torn by racial strife and some deputies were promoting
racial tensions by favouring white panellists over blacks.--Reuter.

IDEALLY what you want for this show is the kids from Fame. It's not
easy. West Side Story is about as demanding as you can get in musicals
and the earnest students from Stirling University Musical Society (in
association with Two Dugs Theatre Company) weren't up to it. They lacked
the training and technique.
No fault of theirs. It's good to be ambitious and to test yourself,
and they tried. But the Bernstein music calls for a high degree of
sophistication.
You need a cast who can dance, sing, and act their hearts out (and
it's true, they usually did what they could with gusto).
You need principals who can sing. Apart from Jamie Revord as
Graziella, who drew a merited round of applause for her winsome delivery
of that sweet number Somewhere, the voices and the attack were
inadequate.
Some scenes were effective, particularly the boisterous numbers like
Gee Officer Krupke. Robert Shorthouse as Riff and his teenage pals the
Jets kept Cool nicely. But no-one was helped by the cumbersome sets,
which kept the band reprising during the lengthy pauses for change of
scene.
Director Douglas James placed far too many demands on his young
company with this piece. It was a bad choice.
But this is only the company's second show, so it's early days yet.
Next time, hopefully, they will find an appropriate vehicle for what
they can offer.

DEBENHAMS last night came to the rescue of the Copenhagen Boys Choir
which, due to a general strike in the Danish capital, arrived in Glasgow
minus their luggage. Rather than sporting a vast array of Danish
football strips, Debenhams, God bless them, stepped in with a batch of
green sweatshirts.
While the absence of their traditional sailor-suits may have marred
the visual impact of their performance, the aural impact remained
unaffected. This is a very impressive choir. Accommodating not only
treble voices but also excellent tenor and bass sections, their ensemble
control and balance is stunning.
Faure's Requiem may not be the ideal opener for a concert but none the
less the spiritual depth of the piece shone through in a wholesome
interpretation. While all movements were exquisitely phrased, it was the
effortless airing by a boy soprano of the Pie Jesu which stole the show.
Angelic beyond belief, the difficult pitching was perfect, each note hit
dead centre. Beautifully sustained, the closing In Paradisum reached
ultimate sublimity.
Bach's Motet for double choir Singet Dem Herrn Ein Neues Lied made up
the most part of the second half. A spirited performance, tempos were
brisk and so demonstrated incredible control throughout the sections in
voicing the intricate fugal part-writing. A collection of Danish folk
tunes capped the entertainment. Simple and elegant lyric songs were the
most effective, particularly the penultimate poignant Evening Prayer.
Their luggage was due to arrive in the early hours of this morning, so
with any luck they should be seen and heard in full glory at today's
lunchtime concert at 12.30pm in Glasgow Cathedral. Catch them if you
can.

<HEADLINE>Workers back after dockyard walk-out</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WORK resumed yesterday on the #43m refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary
landing ship, Sir Bedivere, at Rosyth dockyard after a walk-out by 200
sub-contract workers.
The trouble began at the end of Thursday's shift when four men were
dismissed for allegedly being absent from their place of work. They were
said to have been found drinking cola in the dockyard's synchro-lift
area.
Two hundred of their workmates, also employed by sub-contractor
Consave, walked out in sympathy and part of the backshift was also
affected. Work on the Sir Bedivere was brought to a standstill. However,
yesterday the sacked men were reinstated and work returned to normal.
Convener of the dockyard unions, Mr Brian Negus, said: ''None of our
dockyard members were affected.
''When the dockyard managers, Babcock, were awarded the contract there
was insufficient numbers of our members available to take on the work,
so the sub-contractor was brought in.
''We disapprove of sub-contractors being brought in on principle.''
A spokesman for Babcock said: ''We were not involved. The
sub-contractors decided to take disciplinary action against some of
their employees. They have since been reinstated.''

Allan Stewart surprises fellow Tories with a robust assessment of
their electoral prospects. Robbie Dinwoodie reports on a formidable
operator
ONE of two things happened yesterday when former Scottish Office
Minister Allan Stewart chose to jump back into the political fray. To
use a term from political punditry rather than the law, the jury is
still out.
Either the Member of Parliament for Eastwood took a dispassionate look
at his own prospects, in a constituency which has swung against the
Conservative Party in the recent local elections, and made a bold move
to boost his personal chances of political survival.
Or, he looked at his party's atrocious standing with the overall
electorate in Scotland and decided to fashion himself as the Tory hero
who could turn back the tide of political unpopularity, steering a
course between UK and Scottish issues.
The significance of the timing of his intervention was admitted. He
spoke to BBC Radio Scotland on the morning of last night's annual
general meeting in his Eastwood constituency, and as he turned up for a
lunch in Glasgow yesterday he agreed that this was no coincidence.
But putting ''clear blue water'' between John Major and Tony Blair is
one thing. When Conservative back benchers start doing the same thing
between themselves and their own party leadership it speaks of a deep
malaise.
Getting a response yesterday from the Scottish Conservative and
Unionist Party was like drawing teeth. Under-fire chairman Sir Michael
Hirst was not available as he was ''taking some personal time,'' while
others were also keeping their heads well below the parapet.
The head that popped up unexpectedly had been Allan Stewart's. When he
plans ahead and thinks through issues strategically Stewart is a
formidable operator. When he does things off the cuff without planning
he can be a liability.
Into the latter category comes events on the day which led to his
impending court case over allegations that he and others, including his
son, became involved in a confrontation with protesters hostile to
road-building developments to the south of Glasgow. The headlines forced
him to resign.
In the former category -- that of strategic planning on future
political developments and objectives -- came his stunningly expert
stewardship of the local government Bill through Parliament. Ironically,
the wily politician who saw through the reorganisation then found that
even his own custom-built council bastion in Eastwood fell to Labour.
That is the calculation which led to Stewart breaking ranks yesterday.
He crunched the numbers and realised that his seat was now clearly on
course to be a Labour capture at the next General Election. He looked at
his diary, which showed an annual general meeting of his constituency
party last night, and reached for the telephone and agreed to speak on
BBC Radio Scotland, breaking ranks with his party leadership.
He was at pains to avoid two things. He did not directly attack the
Scottish leadership of the Conservatives, at political or organisational
level. Scottish Secretary Ian Lang was exonerated, as was party chairman
Sir Michael Hirst.
He also took care to target the policies he suggested were suspect.
Taxation was to the fore, in the form of VAT on domestic heating and
other tax rises, notably the threat to mortgage tax relief. What he
specifically avoided -- which was strange given his argument that the
Government must listen to people's views -- was constitutional change.
The Government should listen on fuel bills but not on a Scottish
parliament which might have had enough political nous to avoid adding to
fuel bills. Stewart seemed cheerful and upbeat about his planned policy
rebellion, but he did not specifically clear it in advance with the
party leadership in Scotland.
For most of yesterday it was difficult to get any official response
from the Tory hierarchy on this assault from its erstwhile member. Sir
Michael Hirst was unavailable; the president of the party's voluntary
wing, the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association, David
McLetchie, knew nothing of the detail put out by the Eastwood MP.
But while Tory central office knew nothing of Allan Stewart's
intentions, he knew exactly what he was doing. He issued the text of a
speech to his own constituency last night which could have plausibly
been put out by Paddy Ashdown, if not Tony Blair.
It called for a ''people's market economy'' focusing on small
businesses, a boost for the housing market, and a cut in the rate of VAT
on fuel. His call for a ''common, not a single currency'' steered a
route through the European debate, while his approach on Northern
Ireland was pro-Unionist and his plea on Tory Euro-rebels was
conciliatory.
Only in one area was Allan Stewart a bit over the top. His call to
''tackle the demonstrators head on'' might seem uncomfortably close to
his own direct action against motorway protesters in his constituency
which has landed him in trouble with the law.
But as an appeal to local supporters it has potential. From being
sacked from Government for supposedly clashing with protesters, he has
refashioned himself as a powerful protector of local interests, while
implying that his approach offers the only way back for Tories in the
rest of Scotland.
Tough on Tory problems. Tough on the causes of Tory problems. If Allan
Stewart manages to be one of the few Conservatives left after the next
General Election he may feel his sacking from Government was actually a
chance to kick off his boots and swim away from the wreckage.

OH BOY. Punk lives. And, of all places, in the music of Gorecki. Yes,
he the man of immense, static, contemplative (and a wee bit soporific)
music. Well, not in his Concerto for Keyboard and Strings, written in
1980 and given a turbo-driven performance last night by Irish pianist
Barry Douglas and the serrated strings of the BT Scottish Ensemble.
Blimey, this two-movement act of aggression ought to carry a health
warning. The first movement -- pile-driving strings intoning an endless
chorale against a swirling motoric piano -- is breathless enough, but
when it erupts into a second movement that makes Prokofiev sound as tame
as Delius (sorry, fans) the only word to use is exhilaration; yards of
it.
What a belter of a piece. The battering rhythms of that last movement
reminded me of nothing so much as the brief life of the pogo dance in
the seventies. (Not, you understand, that I ever participated in such
barbaric behaviour myself.)
The Gorecki was also a staggering contrast to Barry Douglas's rather
quixotic performance earlier of Mozart's K414 Piano Concerto, where
over-generous pedalling by the pianist generated something of a
smokescreen around the striking aspects of his playing -- his clarity
and his lyricism. Strange.
Nothing strange about the BeeTees playing in the two string
masterworks which flanked the concertos: Benjamin Britten's Simple
Symphony and the great Frank Bridge Variations. Both works received the
full-blooded treatment from Clio Gould's marvellous young band: brimming
with vigour, an aggressive attack, and some terrifically characterful
playing.
The Variations would have been improved in their cumulative effect
without the pauses between each; continuity suffered a wee bit.

IT may not be the cheeriest of subjects, madness, but the BBC next
week hits the ''fulfilling our commitment to socially responsible
broadcasting'' button by devoting a short season of programmes to mental
health issues. Remarkably, some of them are actually fun.
The season opens on the upbeat with a quite splendid Screen Two
presentation, Crazy For A Kiss (BBC2, Sunday), starring American
comedian Mike McShane. There are clear parallels with the classic One
Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest in this black comedy about sexual
deliverance and teenage angst.
It is loosely based on McShane's own troubled childhood in America.
The idea sprang from the memory of a solitary event which the actor had,
at the time it happened, written down upon a scrap of paper. He found it
years later and it read: ''One sunny day in 1972, my parents packed me
into the car and told me they were taking me to Uncle Dan's. Then, at
the crossroads, they turned left instead of right and they took me to a
loony bin.'' Don't you just hate it when that happens.
He recalls: ''I started crying; I was helpless. Should I grab the
wheel or get out and run? Eventually I just collapsed, resigned.''
McShane had only just turned 14 and he was confined in the mental
institution for six months. It was ''freaky'', he says.
The original idea for the movie was hatched between McShane and
director Chris Bould when the pair were working together on a 10-part
series about Damon Runyon for Channel 4.
''We'd been talking about about Mike's life and what happened to him
as a kid,'' explains Bould. ''At the age of 14, even though he'd never
been laid, never taken drugs, he was still a wild kid. Anywhere else in
the world he would have just been regarded as a regular kid. But because
his was such a parochial upbringing, in a small Kansas town, his parents
just couldn't cope. They were fairly elderly and he really grew up like
the cuckoo in the nest; he was huge while they were diminutive Kansas
folk. And they couldn't handle it.''
The experience left a deep scar in McShane's psyche. He says: ''It has
left me with the view that psychiatry is a shameful profession, treating
disturbance as though it is a disease to be cured, rather than a
condition that arises from living in the world.''
Recalling his teenage life, he adds: ''There was all this strange
madness under the sun. You're a white kid, you have all these luxuries,
and yet you go mad. I was a very angry kid. I felt sorry for myself
being an only child and when people made fun of me for being fat, I'd
fight them.''
These days McShane, who is now in his late 30s, is a reasonably
balanced adult. He has come to terms with his obesity and his
personality, using them both to their advantage in his humour. Though he
is probably best known for his appearances on C4's Whose Line Is It
Anyway?, he has also starred in several television dramas and in Kevin
Costner's movie, Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves (as Friar Tuck,
obviously).
In Crazy For A Kiss, which was filmed on location in Morrow County,
Ohio, he plays Harley, a Hell's Angel inmate at the ''Osceola County
Home for the mentally challenged.'' He befriends ''fat, miserable, and
horny'' teenager Mike Kinross (Shaun Weiss), a new patient whose parents
have had him confined to the institution.
The BBC's States of Mind season, which marks Britain's Mental Health
Week, continues with The Enemy Within (BBC2), a series of short
programmes in which ubiquitous television psychiatrist, Professor
Anthony Clare, talks to celebrities about the quite common mental
problems which they have faced in their lives. None of them has spoken
publicly about them before.
It opens on Sunday with actress Stephanie Cole (Waiting For God)
discussing the phobias which ruled her life after the birth of her
daughter and how she successfully conquered them, not through medicine,
but through hypnotherapy. On Tuesday TV presenter Michaela Strachan
talks about her battle against anorexia which began with a diet when she
was 16.
On Thursday Professor Clare speaks to Mike Yarwood about the
alcoholism which broke up his marriage and destroyed his career. In a
moving interview, he tells of the support he received from AA and how he
embraced its philosophy without reservation -- for an alcoholic, he
says, there is no other choice but total abstinence. He still attends
meetings every week and he has been both dry and sober for more than
four years. ''I don't sit here and say 'I've had my last drink' but what
I will say is that I hope I have,'' he remarks.
Friday night sees actress Imogen Stubbs discussing the panic attacks
which ruled her life during her 20s. She says that they changed her
personality. She went from being happy-go-lucky, positive, and outgoing
to being depressed, obsessed, and a prisoner of her own anxiety. When
Valium failed she turned successfully to physiotherapy and homeopathy.
Later in the series actor, businessman, and former pop star Adam Faith
will talk about post-traumatic stress and writer and broadcaster Sir
Ludovic Kennedy will discuss depression.
This week also sees two quite exceptional documentaries about mental
health. The States of Mind season continues with Horizon (BBC2, Monday)
which challenges the received wisdom that ''hearing voices'' is one of
the primary symptoms of schizophrenia. It suggests that the time could
be right for psychologists and psychiatrists to rethink their
definitions of madness.
Research in Holland and America, says the programme has revealed that
there are many people who have heard voices in their head throughout
their life and have never had to resort to psychiatric help. For others,
voices have been triggered by particularly traumatic events. The film
asks if more effort should go into research which helps people
understand and deal with their voices rather than having them suppressed
with drugs.
Though not formally part of the States of Mind season, QED (BBC1,
Tuesday) investigates the rare brain disorder, Asperger syndrome, from
which as many as 200,000 people (mostly men) in Britain suffer. It is a
mild form of autism which manifests itself in many ways including acute
anxiety, an inability to understand others, bizarre and often
inappropriate behaviour and obsession. The film, entitled I'm Not
Stupid, is narrated by Tom Conti.
Also included in the season is a special showing of a memorable
edition of the 1970s drama series Colditz (BBC2, Wednesday) in which
Michael Bryant stars as a POW who is determined to escape by feigning
madness.
Finally, The Asylum War (BBC2, Monday) is a dramatised documentary,
often harrowing, about how a new approach to the treatment of the
mentally ill in the eighteenth century altered the history of madness
forever. It was an ideological battle fought mostly in the city of York.
On the one side there was the York Asylum where pauper patients were
beaten, starved, and chained up while on the other was the York Retreat,
run by Quakers on revolutionary principles of non-restraint. The film
tells how the situation became a national scandal, prompting a
parliamentary inquiry which paved the way for reforms.
BBC SCOTLAND, it seems, will stop at nothing in its ruthless quest for
higher audience ratings. ''Please can we ask you do not reveal Wee
Jock's fate from this episode -- thank you,'' states the note which
accompanied the preview video copy for this week's Hamish Macbeth (BBC1,
Sunday). Shock, horror . . . Hamish's trusted canine companion, the
plucky wee West Highland terrier, gets knocked down and seriously
injured by two escaped convicts. Does he survive? Sorry, but we're
clearly sworn to secrecy.
With a vengeance, PC Macbeth (Robert Carlyle) goes after the villains,
who're living rough in the hills. Posing as a hillwalker, he befriends
them only to discover that Wee Jock is not their only accident victim.
They once knocked down and killed a young boy during a robbery.
Meanwhile, the village cop's sidekick, TV John, rounds up a posse who
head off to save Hamish from himself.
Rules of Engagement (ITV, Monday), the pilot for a
heavy-on-the-violence cop drama from Yorkshire Television, comes with an
excellent pedigree. It was written by Geoff McQueen (creator of The Bill
who died suddenly last year), and made by producer Peter Norris and
director Charles McDougall, the men behind the first series of Between
The Lines.
The hour-long programme follows the adventures of the fictional
National Crime Task Force, an elite squad recruited from the cops,
Special Branch, the SAS, and the security services. Criticised by the
press and by more conventional police forces, they tackle renegade
terrorists, drug dealers, and armed bank robbers.
It stars Frances Barber as the ambitious Home Office minister who
persuades the Government to set up the crack unit and Ciaran Hinds as
the fast-track super cop who takes charge. Rules of Engagement, like The
Thieftakers (last year's sub-Sweeney pilot which looks like being made
into a series) represents a trend away from the thoughtful, more gentle,
Morse and Frost cop shows towards a tougher, less cerebral, type of
policier. A sign of the times, perhaps.

Marlon Brando's troubled daughter was found hanged this week. Allan
Laing describes the tortured life and times of the actor's family
IT is ironic in the tragic circumstances that Marlon Brando's most
powerful screen role was that of Don Corleone, the paternal giant who
ruled a New York Mafia fiefdom in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather.
For in reality, the legendary actor has arguably been an abject failure
as a father.
Somewhere along the line, a demon appeared and took possession of
Brando's progeny, casting a spell of misery and misfortune upon his
showbiz kids. There is no greater pain on earth than the loss of a
child. It defies life's symmetry to see an offspring go to the grave
before a father. It is the ultimate sadness.
In Brando's case, it reads like some inferior Hollywood melodrama.
First there was the legal battle. After his bitter divorce in 1960 from
Welsh actress Anna Kashfi, he fought for 14 years to gain custody of
their troubled son, Christian. He won. Then, in 1991, that same son was
sentenced to 10 years in jail for the killing of Dag Drollet, boyfriend
of his half-sister, Cheyenne.
And now this. Last Sunday Cheyenne, once beautiful and now tortured in
mind and body, was found hanged in the bedroom of her home on the island
of Tahiti, the place where Brando sought refuge so many years ago. She
had finally taken her own life. Those who knew her had seen it coming.
She had tried three times before. They were not cries for help; they
were deliberate breaks for freedom from the world and all its pain.
Her death came a matter of days after she had lost a legal battle to
gain custody of her son, born a few weeks after Drollet's homicide at
the hands of her half-brother, to whom she was once very close.
Maybe it was fate balancing the books for, in this tragic story, the
child is truly father of the man. In his recent autobiography, Songs My
Mother Taught Me, he recalls his own troubled upbringing. His father, a
travelling salesman, was little more than a drunken womaniser. He
appeared to be an emotional cripple, unable to display any form of love
or affection to his son. Indeed, he was often quick to criticise the
young Marlon, convinced that the boy would be a failure.
Ignored by his father, he sought comfort in the arms of his doting
mother and elder sisters. The result was a spoiled young man with a neat
line in some fairly anti-social behaviour.
You might have thought, then, that as a father Brando would have gone
out of his way to set a better example to his children. But Cheyenne
once said that she had come to despise him for the way he showed her
scant regard in her childhood. On his brief visits to Tahiti as she grew
up, he often chose to ignore her, she claimed.
And yet, by the same token, the enigmatic Brando cared enough about
his children to ensure that they were protected from the Hollywood
system. He studiously avoided placing them in the limelight. Their life
was kept private and away from the cameras. They were no-one's business
but their own.
Still, Christian (named after Brando's Mutiny On The Bounty character,
the filming of which introduced him to his beloved Tahiti) turned into a
problem teenager. By the time he was 30 he was a failure. He had a
serious drug problem and no career. Cheyenne, once confident, boastful,
and spoiled, had also turned to drugs and was showing the first serious
signs of depression.
She began a relationship with Drollet, a bulkily built native
Tahitian, and became pregnant. In 1990, Drollet was found shot to death
and Christian was charged with his killing. No-one really knows the
truth to the case but, at his celebrated trial, Christian claimed that
Drollet had been beating Cheyenne.
Now, somehow, Marlon Brando must live with his tragedy; come to terms
with his loss. It seems he genuinely loved his daughter. Perhaps his
only failure was in not showing her the affection, the guidance, and the
understanding she deserved.
As this story started with irony, so shall it finish. Only last week,
after she lost the custody battle for her five-year-old son, Brando made
a desperate bid to save her. He made arrangements to bring her back to
America for psychiatric treatment. A family friend is reported to have
said: ''Even though she said she hated him, he wasn't giving up. he was
trying to get her the best help money could buy. He loved her. The idea
was to get her in a mental institution as soon as possible.''
The best help money could buy. There, perhaps, lies the problem.
Brando is rich but no amount of money can purchase what a child, even a
tortured child, needs most. You cannot put a price upon a parent'slove.

A BULK carrier was going too fast and had no effective look-out when
it collided in fog in the English Channel, an official accident report
said yesterday.
The carrier Western Winner hit a BP tanker which then caught fire with
the loss of nine of its crew.
Four of the dead on the Bermuda-registered British Trent were British
and two were Irish. Twenty other crew members were rescued in the June
1993 incident. None of the Panama-registered Western Winner's crew was
hurt.
The immediate cause of the collision was the ''failure of both vessels
to comply with the International Regulations for the Prevention of
Collisions at Sea in conditions of restricted visibility,'' the Marine
Accident Investigation Branch said in its report.
It added that the Western Winner's captain was unfamiliar with the
area off Ostend, Belgium.
The MAIB found that: Western Winner did not proceed at a safe speed;
she did not keep an effective look-out and did not make proper use of
radar; British Trent was not seen and there was not enough time to take
appropriate avoiding action.
However, British Trent did not make proper use of her radar and she
was disembarking her pilot and thought, wrongly, that other ships would
keep clear of her while this was going on.
Judgment of both masters may have been impaired because of fatigue and
stress, the report said.
The 25,000-tonne British Trent was loaded with a full cargo of petrol.
Some of this spilled out after the collision and caught fire.
Dense smoke forced the crew to jump into the sea where nine of them,
including three from Sierra Leone, died as a result of smoke inhalation.
The report said that on British Trent no fire-fighting or
water-cooling was possible because the main fire pumps had not been
started and the fire main had been damaged in the collision.
The MAIB added: ''The ability to start the fire pumps from the bridge
would have saved time and reduced the risk to the crew members who
showed courage and determination in attempting to get them started.
''The damage to the fire main might also have been noticed if it had
been possible to start the fire pumps from the bridge, and if the master
had known this, he might have decided to abandon ship at an earlier
stage.''
British Trent was on her way from Antwerp to Fiumicino in Italy.
The 30,000-tonne Western Winner, part-loaded with copper dross, was on
a voyage from London to Vlissingen.
The accident happened in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes and
the MAIB, which had been asked by the Bermuda Government to investigate
the accident, made a number of recommendations.
It the Bermudan shipping authorities should ask Belgium and the
Netherlands to get world shipping authorities to look into ways of
improving shipping safety in the area.
The MAIB also said Bermuda should ask for an international review of
lifeboat provision on board tankers built before July 1, 1986.
The International Maritime Organisation also was asked to look at how
new and existing tankers could deal with a similar emergency and study
the matter of rest breaks for crews.
In addition to the 29 crew, five sea cadets and two wives of crewmen
were on British Trent.
The cadets and the wives survived but one of the women, Kathryn Hirst,
lost her husband, chief officer Adrian Hirst, 25, from Fellgate, Tyne
and Wear.
The MAIB said the scope of its investigation into the Western Winner's
action had been limited because solicitors representing the ship's
owners had prevented the inquiry team from interviewing the captain and
officers.
In December 1993, the captain and the owners -- Liberia-based Alpha
Beta Investments -- were charged with manslaughter by the prosecutor's
office in Bruges.
The captain subsequently has failed to appear at a number of scheduled
hearings, the next of which is due next month.
An inquest into the deaths of the Britons on British Trent is due to
be held in Poole, Dorset, next month.

THE union representing health service professional and technical staff
has called on Greater Glasgow Health Board to reconsider its proposals
to close the Western Infirmary and Rutherglen Maternity Hospital.
The Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union wants further
consultation with the public and staff on the proposals, which it claims
will dramatically affect the quality and standards of care for all
patients in the west of Glasgow and for mothers and babies in the
south-east of the city.
MSF regional officer Mr Michael Fuller said: ''The health board is
about to rush through proposals that will have a serious and detrimental
effect on healthcare for patients in Glasgow and beyond.
''The board wants to remove #56m and almost 1000 beds from Glasgow's
health services. That will mean the loss of thousands of jobs. And the
proposal to save #14m through a process known as benchmarking will
substantially reduce the terms and conditions of the staff who remain.''
He added: ''There is no evidence in the board's consultation document
to justify such major surgery of the NHS in Glasgow. Indeed, many
decisions on the future of patient care in Glasgow -- including the very
important provision of accident and emergency services -- will be made
by the board in secret after the consultation period has ended.''
In its response to the board, the MSF also claimed that the board's
last major review of accident and emergency facilities recommended that
these should all be retained. The union called for a further and
separate consultation period on this proposal, which its sees as by far
the most serious.
Campaigners trying to save Rutherglen Maternity Hospital have also
demanded that the consultation period, due to finish at the end of this
month, be extended. The Labour MP for Rutherglen, Mr Tommy McAvoy, said
he would be raising the matter with the Scottish Office and at
Westminster.
The Rutherglen representative on the campaign group, Ms Kim Margey,
said there had been a lack of information to date.

Cuts in overnight rail services will have a severe impact on
travellers from Scotland. Iain Wilson meets passengers who stand most to
lose
THE introduction of sleeper-only overnight trains between Scotland and
England next month hides many a human tragedy. The loss of seated
accommodation on overnight services has been largely ignored because of
the furore over axing the Fort William-London sleeper and Anglo-Scottish
Motorail services on the same day, May 28.
But its brutal impact on people can be graphically illustrated by
speaking to those who sit in the overnight trains rather than occupy the
more expensive sleeping berths, usually taken up by the affluent or
expense-account traveller.
The impending fate of those unwilling -- or unable -- to meet the #25,
one-way supplement for a bed -- suggests that the British Rail board is
failing to take social issues into account while carrying through the
Government's privatisation programme.
ScotRail, now responsible for the overnight services, conceded as much
when it acknowledged that sleeper capacity is being retained ''at the
expense of seated carriages because it made operational -- and economic
-- sense.'' However, it also insisted that demand for sleeper berths is
far higher than that for overnight seats.
The loss of seated accommodation follows rail franchising director
Roger Salmon excluding the Fort William and West Country cross-border
services from routes guaranteed on rail privatisation.
He argued subsidies on the loss-making sleeper service could be better
used to support others -- in particular, Scottish rural services.
His withdrawal of support means from May 28 that ScotRail will run
sleeper-only services from Aberdeen, Inverness, Glasgow, and Edinburgh.
The Aberdeen and Inverness trains will both have six sleeper
carriages, a lounge car, and a brake car. They will link up as one train
at Edinburgh. The same applies for the Edinburgh and Glasgow trains,
which will unite at Carstairs.
However, London's Euston platforms can take only up to 16-coach
trains. Seated carriages are being dropped to keep sleeper capacity up.
But it is clear many people want seated accommodation. Some visit
relatives or friends, and find it convenient to travel overnight rather
than lose a day in travelling.
Others are students, tourists, or workers with limited travel
expenses. All regard the withdrawal as underlining commercial
considerations and as a blow to travel opportunity and choice.
For some, the sit-up carriages are literally a lifeline, according to
The Herald's straw poll of users. They included, on just one train from
Glasgow to London:
* Registered blind student Anne Mitchell, of Kilmarnock, who finds
them the most convenient and satisfactory way to travel south;
* Philip Thomson, another student, from Glasgow, a regular patron who
receives medical treatment in London which is not available in Scotland,
and;
* Young mother Amanda Ramsay, of Paisley, whose sister lives in London
-- and whose birthday coincides with the withdrawal of seated carriages.
Also on board was Peter Connelly, 31, from Kilmarnock -- heading south
to attend the funeral of his god daughter, aged just two.
Many people just like them face switching to overnight buses to losing
wages by travelling by daytime trains.
''It's ridiculous,'' said Harry Alder, 46, of Kilmarnock, whose common
law wife Anne, 38, is visually impaired. The couple were heading for
Heathrow, where a short-break holiday flight to Paris cost #77-a-head
compared with #200 from Glasgow.
Although numbers using seating accommodation on the overnight trains
is said to be small, they were unable -- as long as a month ago -- to
obtain seats for tomorrow's Glasgow-bound train. That meant an overnight
hotel bill of #100 in London.
''The alternative of a bus is just not good enough for Anne,'' said
Alder, a professional entertainer. ''It's a tedious, tedious journey.''
Anne, a student in business administration at Motherwell College, also
argued it was ''impossible'' to take her dog for the blind on long-haul
buses because it would not be able to exercise.
''The train is more comfortable, convenient, and almost as cheap,''
she said of her #29 Super Apex return fare. ''What makes the withdrawal
worse is that it is being forced on the public. Another choice is being
lost.''
Philip Thomson, 24, of Riddrie, Glasgow, studying for an MSc in marine
technology at Strathclyde University, has hereditary eye problems. He is
undergoing laser treatment at Moorefields Hospital, near Islington. He
attends at least six times a year for the keratotamy treatment to cure
short-sightedness.
Thomson recalled taking the bus once, and swearing he would never do
it again. The police were called even before departure. Someone was
locked in the toilet. When freed, it was found he had been sick. The
bathroom was out of action throughout the journey.
''The overnight trains are popular because you don't lose a day
travelling,'' he said. At least two more eye operations are needed, and
he now faces taking the bus -- or hitch-hiking.
Housewife Amanda Ramsay, 27, of Grahamston Court, Paisley, was
travelling to see her sister Jan, now living in London after years
abroad. She was accompanied by daughters Alison, three, and Claire,
four, for #29 return. No way could she more than double that outlay on a
sleeper berth: ''I planned to repeat this journey on May 28, which is
Jan's birthday. The withdrawal rules that out. I am very disappointed.''
She ruled out buses as an alternative, because such travel overnight
with young children was ''a nightmare . . . the trains give them freedom
to roam, and afterwards they tend to sleep, making the journey better
all round.''
Others also paid tribute to the benefits of the overnight seated
accommodation, described as a national asset by the Railway Development
Society which fears network contraction will continue in the search for
profits.
THE Kenilworth pulled out of Glasgow Central on time at 11.37pm,
hauling six sleepers and four coaches, each with 56 seats. The carriages
were half full.
Those in Standard Accommodation Class, without berths, were unable to
buy a nightcap. The lounge, sealed off from the rest of the train, was
the strict preserve of those travelling First Class with sleeper
tickets.
The buffet bar for SAC opened at Motherwell, serving tea (77p), coffee
(87p) and soft drinks (70p), orange juice (95p) and sparkling water
(95p). A packet of crisps cost 55p, a Kit Kat, 32p, with a cheese
ploughman's sandwich costing #1.79.
Less than a quarter into the seven hour, 18-minute journey several
toilets were already out of commission. Someone had also been sick in a
corridor.
Carlisle was reached at 1.34am, where the train stood until 2.08am.
Numerous children were still awake, running around. Some youngsters,
even adults, were sleeping on the floor, under tables -- their feet
blocking passageways.
By 3.15am, those who had brought carry-outs were still trying to drink
themselves into oblivion.
Many passengers, young and old, remained awake at 5am when I finally
managed a slumber from sheer exhaustion. It was soon broken, as children
invented a game that consisted of opening and shutting the non-automatic
carriage doors. They also screeched, like cockerels greeting the dawn,
which it was.
The train arrived at Euston nine minutes early, at 6.46am. People who
had not booked in advance payed #58 for the privilege. The #25 extra for
a sleeper now seemed a bargain.
However, there is no doubting that a market exists for the seated
trains, which presumably would increase if operators pushed for a
retention let alone expansion of the network.
Peter Connelly and girlfriend Caroline Neil, of Kilmarnock were aboard
for to attend the London funeral of a toddler.
Connelly, 31, a handyman, ruled out a sleeper on grounds of cost, and
dismissed buses as a viable alternative because ''they do your box in;
you cannot even walk about''. He said of the withdrawal: ''It's
terrible. They are just trying to profiteer out of rail privatisation.
People will have to take the sleeper or get the bloody buses.''
Seaman Tony Bradley, 48, of Southampton, was heading home after
disembarking at Renfrew. He said expenses did not cover a sleeper, but
at least the carriage was spacious and comfortable. ''Their removal
takes away freedom of travel. The Government is to blame. At this rate,
Scotland won't have train services. People should wake up, and pretty
soon.''
Marc Kiernan, 22, of Cumbernauld, was accompanying girlfriend Kirsty
Reid, from Motherwell, who hoped to get a place at a London university.
''The sleeper is too expensive,'' he said. ''But the seated train does
allow us to go down without the expense of staying overnight in
London.''
East Kilbride couple Danny and Chrissie Gallacher were going on
holiday to Portugal, flying from Manchester because of a lack of Glasgow
flights. They had planned to go by bus, only to discover they would have
had a 12-hour wait on their return home.
''It really bothers me that the trains are being taken away,'' said
the former Clydebank plater. ''Where's the option to choose? It's
wrong.''
Highland Regional Council will soon take legal action aimed at
stopping the withdrawal of the Fort William-London sleeper, its timing
subject only to advice from senior counsel.
Ken Sutherland, research officer of the Railway Development Society
(Scotland), hopes that action will be followed by similar Court of
Session challenges on the loss of overnight seated carriages, blamed on
Government subsidy cutbacks to ScotRail.
Sutherland said the full social and economic damage to Scotland was
vicious in terms of holidaymakers, tourists, students, and others. He
claimed the loss of seated overnight trains was likely to cause an
irreversible cycle of decline in the east and west coast InterCity
routes.

THE political meetings are over, the opinion polls have been banned
all week, and French voters are heading for the polls tomorrow to choose
from nine candidates.
The two with most votes will then fight a duel in a second round of
voting on May 7, for the prize of seven years as President of the French
Republic and power unequalled in any Western democracy.
The last polls, and unofficial polls leaked since, put RPR Gaullist
candidate Jacques Chirac six or seven points ahead of socialist Lionel
Jospin and well in front of his deadly rival and fellow Gaullist, Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur.
The big questions of tomorrow's vote are, firstly, whether Mr Jospin
can make it to the second round for a traditional right wing-left wing
contest. Ill-prepared for the first round of the election, the Socialist
Party appears ready for the second, should it happen, with a new slogan,
Real Change, and a series of meetings already scheduled.
A second possibility is that Mr Balladur could make good and go
through to a bruising bout with Mr Chirac which would cause even more
damage to a seriously divided Gaullist party. The third uncertainty is
whether the National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who is almost
neck-and-neck with Mr Balladur, could make it for a second-round fight
with Mr Chirac.
That sinister last prospect is also, in the mind of the far-right
leader, a real one, as he thundered out during his final election
meeting near Paris on Thursday night -- another highly theatrical,
skilfully orchestrated rally of banner-waving, chauvinism, and
xenophobia, which has become a standard and unquestioned ingredient of
French political life.
We have had a campaign dominated, almost dictated, by fluctuations in
the opinion polls. With around 60% of people prepared to vote for the
right and the far right and only 37% ready to support the left, the
campaign has accentuated the French electorate's natural conservative
bias.
Parties have tailored their meetings as never before for television
and coverage has tended to concentrate on the fight between Mr Balladur
and Mr Chirac -- more a clash of personalities than of ideas, with the
former's cautious and over-polite style constantly upstaged by the
latter's shameless tub-thumping.
Officially 3.3 million French people (many more, unofficially,
according to left-wing candidates) are out of work, and the campaign's
over-riding theme has been unemployment. The seriousness of the
situation has engendered mainly scepticism -- talking last week to a
number of people who were out of jobs, I realised none of them believed
any candidate would do any good.
The communist Robert Hue would reduce the working week from 39 to 35
hours, as would the ecologist Dominique Voynet, who urges massive
investment in non-polluting forms of transport and the creation of more
public sector jobs. Mr Jospin favours reducing the working week to 37
hours, after negotiation between management and unions, and would reduce
unemployment among the young by launching renovation schemes for
run-down suburban districts and encouraging domestic jobs such as home
helps for the elderly.
Mr Balladur, frequently repeating he makes no promises he cannot keep,
would aim to reduce unemployment by one million before the year 2000 by
lowering the high social service charges employers pay on wages and by
waiving such charges when hiring the unemployed.
Mr Chirac proposes exonerating management from charges for two years
if they hire people who are out of work. He would also pay bosses a #250
monthly bonus for hiring any of the 1,250,000 people in France who have
been out of work for more than a year.
In many people's opinion, that is just conjuring with figures and
extreme solutions are beginning to appeal. Arlette Laguiller, the
Trotskyst candidate, whose virulent sincerity, revolutionary hand-book
phrases, and tenacity (this is her fourth campaign) could win her more
that 5% of votes, last week declared a virtual class war. She wants to
requisition all profit-making firms which make people redundant and is
pushing for strikes once the election is over.
The independent extreme-right candidate Philippe de Villiers, who has
been stealing some of Mr Le Pen's nationalistic thunder, wants to tax
imports from Third World countries to reduce competition and let the
franc float, to encourage trade.
Mr Le Pen, meanwhile, would expel France's three to four million North
African immigrant workers. And around one in seven French voters could
be voting for him.

<HEADLINE>Ayr nightclub where three died closes doors    Owners abandon fight for Hanger 13</HEADLINE>

THE owners of the Hanger 13 nightclub in Ayr, scene of three
drug-related deaths, have abandoned their fight to keep the venue open.
McCall's Entertainment Ltd said yesterday it had withdrawn an appeal
challenging a decision last year by Kyle and Carrick licensing committee
to suspend the venue's licence. The firm said it was unable to pursue
the action on cost grounds but faces a legal bill running into tens of
thousands of pounds.
The venue on the Ayr seafront had remained open after an appeal was
lodged, in spite of the controversy surrounding the deaths of three
young men last year. All had taken the drug ecstasy.
In May, Mr John Nisbet, 18, of New Cumnock, and Mr Andrew Dick, 19, of
Glasgow, died from the effects of taking ecstasy at a rave event in the
club. In August, Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20, of Rigside, Lanarkshire, died
in similar circumstances.
Following a fatal accident inquiry in February, Sheriff Neil Gow, QC,
warned of the effects of the ''leisure drug'', saying: ''A dance with
ecstasy can lead to a dance with death.''
While he laid no particular blame at the door of the club's
management, the sheriff called for a strong Government lead on tackling
drug abuse.
Mr Desmond Cheyne, QC, acting for the club's operator, Mrs Christine
Ridha, told Ayr Sheriff Court that a decision by the licensing board
earlier this year to refuse a late-night licence meant the firm's appeal
had become academic. He said his clients had decided to call it a day so
as not to inconvenience the court.
Last night, there was a mixed reaction to the closure. Some claimed a
much-loved Ayr landmark and a popular venue had been forced to close
unnecessarily. Others breathed a sigh of relief.
Mrs Ridha said she had been a victim of circumstances. While she had
held every faith in the success of the company's appeal, she said that
the legal bid had been withdrawn over the issue of costs. The club's 40
staff will now lose their jobs.
She said: ''I'm extremely disappointed. I've had people who come to
the club on the phone in tears because it's closing down. Shutting us
down will not get rid of the drugs problem. It's a problem in society
which everybody knows about. We tried to deal with it by having
paramedics on duty and giving education to those who were tempted.''
Mr Phil Gallie, MP for Ayr, said: ''The closure of the Pavilion
Ballroom and Hanger 13 means that a cross-section of the community are
deprived of a decent venue. The Pavilion was also used for ballroom
dancing as well as a rave venue. It is a loss to Ayr as a whole.''
In contrast, Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick Cumnock and Doon
Valley, said he was pleased the appeal had been dropped. He added:
''However, we must not be fooled into thinking that this solves the drug
problem. A great deal needs to be done in terms of police action and
education.''

TRUTH, as you may have heard, is rarely pure, and never simple. This
must be accounted a sizeable misfortune for television ''theme''
evenings. Rising from our semi-recumbent posture to attend on Wilde
Night (BBC2, Saturday), we were reminded that in matters of grave
importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.
Wilde Night was sopping with sincerity, a little of which is
dangerous, and a great deal absolutely fatal. A Professor Alan Sinfield,
of the University of Sussex, appeared as an ''Open Space Special'' to
state that the idea of effeminacy is bad for everyone.
He fretted over Saint Oscar, ''the quintessential queer'' with a
''contradictory legacy''. His was an essay on gender in which Wilde,
bisexual and the quintessence only of himself, was an unwitting
participant.
Identified here as ''the most famous queer person in history'',
presumably on the grounds that Alexander the Great's sexual politics are
tricky to locate, Oscar was deployed to advance the thesis that gays are
no better off today than they were a century ago.
It was noted that the English are as attached to camp as they are to
homophobia, and that, harrowingly, there exist ''false and narrow
notions of what men and women are like''. Of Wilde it told us nothing.
Better, in 10 bare minutes, was Simon Callow. His Oscar and Me was the
memoir of a friend that identified genius as a conversational gift.
Ironically, this was to prove the night's problem: which, among the many
participants, could talk about Wilde as well as he could talk about
himself? Callow came closest when he praised ''an original who raised
fun to a principle of being''. Just so.
The Lives and Loves of Oscar Wilde, a Timewatch production, could have
done with a little more fun. We heard what was thought to be Oscar's own
voice, reciting Reading Gaol as though conjured at a seance and
sounding, with those wisps of Irishness persisting, rather like Shaw.
We saw Lady Alice Douglas, the great grand niece, still doing penance
for Bosie, working with prisoners. Merlin Holland, Wilde's doleful
grandson, meanwhile explained why he has not reclaimed the family name.
Yet this was a piece on the tragedy of Oscar, not his triumph. At his
trials they denied him thrice and broke him thoroughly, as is the
English custom; but we learned little about the great rhetorical sweep
of his prose, or the impeccable logic, like a function of good taste,
that has made his wit so enduring. It was hard to glimpse the honest,
generous, lover of fun Whitman called a ''great, big, splendid boy''.
It took two Celts -- Isobel Murray in Aberdeen, and Owen Dudley
Edwards, an Irishman in Edinburgh -- to give some substance to the
witterings of Sir Peter Hall, the living proof that there really is no
sin except stupidity.
Edwards was splendid on the Bosie Business. Murray, whose knowledge of
Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde is matchless, reminded us that
D'Oyly Carte once hired him to explain ''funny'' to Americans. He should
be living at this hour.
In the end, though, this ''theme night'' was a lone feature with
padding, and much of it proof that a man cannot be too careful in his
choice of admirers. Still, never speak disrespectfully of documentaries.
Only people who can't get into one do that.
On the other hand, there are some infotainments you wouldn't really
want to get into. Absolutely Supermodels (what a clever title!) was one
of the best documentaries I ever slept through and evidence, if any is
still needed, that ITV's definition of factual programming is looser
than a frock on Kate Moss.
Here were 30 minutes in which nothing was said because there was
nothing to say, unless you count the wisdom of Karl Lagerfeld, to wit:
''There has to be more than a face behind the face.'' The trite is
rarely pure, and always simple.
All the girls who give good hair seemed wedded to spurious glamour and
the indefinite article. There was Helena, Nadja, Tyra, Carla, Angelika,
Claudia, and a ''reporter'' named Catrina. Mea coulda sworea she even
asked, ''Do the clothes dictate the way you feel, or do you think it's
in your genes?'' Like Levi or Wrangler?
It was almost touching in its fatuous fashion, as though both the
lives and the faces of the mannequins had to fit. ''Someone found me in
a cafe in Berlin'', said a startling bottle-blonde, this being
model-speak for ''Some guy fancied me in the pub''. Why is ITV producing
this garbage? I don't think we will ever be told.
Absolutely Fabulous (BBC1, Thursday) meanwhile marches, or rather
lurches, towards its end, true to itself, impure and never simple. An
old porn mag is found, setting Eddy's pulse, and a few other things,
racing.
'It's so degrading to women,'' says the wise daughter.
''What do you mean?'' Patsy retorts, ''She's got the whip.''
Oddly, the weakest character is Eddy herself, who this week was being
hassled by the reproaches of her ''battery clothes''. The other players
are actors, June Whitfield conspicuously so; but Jennifer Saunders
remains essentially a sketch turn, and at times she adds an excess of
excess to a show that needs it the way Patsy needs another Bolly-Stolly.
Still, it's no great crime from a writer who can encapsulate the
mother-son relationship as ''umbilical whiplash''.
That truth is rarely simple is a maxim journalists tend to forget,
until something like the Oklahoma murders comes along. On the day of
bleeding horror, the BBC excelled itself, pulling in experts and pulling
together reports with a professionalism that has become rare, even for
the Corporation. Suddenly you were reminded what public service
broadcasting is for.
Yet what was most obvious, for our purposes, was the extent to which
the pseudo-creed of ''Birtism'' is useless in such situations. When the
body count is rising and the news is still moving, you can't put in
three months of plodding research, nor write your script in advance and
fit the film around it, nor pull the show if some politician finds it
disagreeable.
You can have good reporters on the ground, however, and Paxman in a
studio trying to make sense of events as they unfold, not for the sake
of a clever thesis, but for the sake of bewildered viewers. Let's just
hope, against the odds, that Oklahoma is a lesson learned.

<HEADLINE>Police sting smashes Slovakian uranium-smuggling ring</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978764033</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Bratislava, Friday
SLOVAK police made a significant seizure of suspected uranium and have
broken up an international smuggling ring in a well-prepared sting, the
Interior Ministry announced today.
Spokesman Peter Ondera said police had seized 37lb 4oz of radioactive
material in eastern Slovakia on April 13 and detained nine people from
the Ukraine, Hungary, and Slovakia in a series of raids.
Investigators expect results on Monday from an analysis of the
material to show whether it is uranium and if it is weapons grade,
Ondera said.
''There are no doubts this is nuclear material, and so far we're sure
it's uranium, but we just don't know what kind,'' he said.
Police found the material, the biggest haul made in Slovakia, in a
container hidden in a car which they stopped near the town of Poprad in
the east of the country.
Ondera said police had followed the Hungarian-registered car carrying
two Hungarians since it entered Slovakia from Ukraine and stopped it at
the foot of the Tatra mountains.
''We know that the car was definitely headed for Hungary, but we don't
know the final destination, but the material was meant to be sold
somewhere,'' he added.
The seizure followed an extensive investigation into an organised
group of smugglers that authorities knew had been planning the run since
November.
Altogether four Slovaks, three Hungarians, and two Ukrainians were
formally arrested yesterday and charged with either illegal possession
of radioactive material or complicity in the possession of it.
If the material turns out to be weapons grade, the haul would be a big
find in efforts to smash the illict trade in uranium from nuclear
installations in the former Soviet Union.
WASHINGTON: The US, seeking to salvage its landmark nuclear accord
with North Korea, has proposed to upgrade deadlocked negotiations by
bringing in senior diplomats.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters there had been no
formal response from Pyongyang, but said: ''We hope those talks take
place soon.''
In Berlin, where the talks broke up yesterday after three rounds,
senior North Korean negotiator Kim Jong-u blamed Washington for the
collapse.--Reuter.

It was the year's big bash, and Glasgow lapped it up in its own
inimitable style. Anne Simpson and Stephen McGinty bring you the flavour
of Thursday night's Armani/Herald charity show
There were Bearsden lawyers, medics, accountants, all of a certain
age, swigging designer beers from the neck
WHAT's all this nonsense about falling hemlines? At the style party of
the year in Glasgow's Tramway the skirts in the Emporio Armani/Herald
Show were so tiny stocking tops were not a fashion abberation but a
statement. In fact if anyone had found a moment free to measure the
skirts from waist to hem they would have discovered they made just under
12 inches on the downward drop -- which in column inches is just about
half the length of this broadsheet page.
With their rope-weave berets, Roman sandals, their owlish sun specs
perched at the end of the nose, and nomad's bucket bags hung on the
back, 30 models strode the catwalk specially built to resemble an
anthracite highway. Here, against a weather forecast which had promised
snow, were the brief and filmy raiments of a spectacular Italian summer
making up the foot patrol of Armani's fabled understatement: no
over-gilding, no flashy prints, no colour beyond the characteristic
ivories and navy, tobacco browns and black. No urgent flouncing, either,
no over-emphatic twirls. Just a squad of models drawn from all over
Scotland and London confidently affirming that a cool attitude is the
most seductive glamour of all.
This was the second time Emporio Armani had held a show in association
with The Herald, and, in fact, only the second time they had presented
such a charity event north of the Border. In the scale of these things
The Tramway was a piece of history, drawing 1200 people, the largest
Armani audience at any show outside the trade show in Milan.
Tender, little chemises of floating whiteness, suede micro kilts and
miniature sarongs appeared alongside pants in flowing fabrics which were
worn wide but without the ungainliness of bellbottoms. Sometimes minis
were wrapped orientally over trousers, and fabulous pale linen shirts
billowed like clouds.
For men, the suit lived but only in Emporio Armani's dark,
unstructured form with loose, high-buttoned jackets, all with mandarin
collars. But both on and off the catwalk the look of the nonchalant hunk
prevailed -- at least among the men. In fact at this party there was as
much celebration of golden youth among the audience as there was on the
actual runway. But this being Glasgow, the different generations present
boogied any gap between them into non-existence. There were Bearsden
lawyers, medics, accountants, all of a certain age, swigging designer
beers from the neck while in other corners of The Tramway's vast space
the Champagne Charlies, inspired by the exuberant rhythms of Scotland's
Lisa M, converted to funk.
All this post-show razz and sass was orchestrated by those hot
impresarios of Glasgow club style, Colin Barr and his wife, Kelly Cooper
Barr. If proof were needed, they were the living evidence that fashion
is much more than a brisk business of wearing clothes. For weeks they
had worked round the clock with their staff from Voodoo Room, The Living
Room and The Lounge to create a nightclub and chill-out room off The
Tramway's main hall.
As ever at charity events many talented friends were called on to
donate their artistry. In the chill-out room Sandy Martin's exquisite
central flower arrangement stood on a pedestal, like a
nineteenth-century French still life, the blossoms complementing the
fine botanical banners from graphic wizards Timorous Beasties. The bar
artwork had been done by Graven Images, and the four prizes in the
raffle -- which included a voucher for a #450 Emperio Armani outfit --
were drawn by STV's Kaye Adams, Shereen Nanjiani and Kelly Cooper Barr.
By the time Misty Oldland and her band took the stage, the dry ice was
rising and the pecs 'n' specs theme of the catwalk was now a part of the
nightclub crowd. This was a one-off Glasgow gig for Misty, who flew from
London, interrupting the recording of her new album in order to take
part in the charity event. Half Swiss, she wears her hair in Heidi
braids, but there is nothing coyly folksy about this cat's style. For
the Glasgow jazz session, she wore an Armani frockcoat which was the
most dazzling outfit of the night: #7000 worth of irreverent pinstripes
defined in black and silver sequins. But all good party outfits come to
an end. By mid-morning, next day, the coat was back in the Armani vaults
in London.
And, in fact, for many mid-morning next day was just about the time
this event finally spun to a close. At The Tramway things came to a halt
at 1am, but indefatigable boppers then moved off to spontaneous house
soirees of their own. And the Met Office snows forgot to fall; the
weather was benign.
So, our abundant thanks to everyone who helped to make this the year's
Big Party, and, unrehearsed, moved as one to form animated tableaux of
their own. THE only serious element of Glasgow's night of fashion
concerned the two charities who will benefit from the event: Scottish
European Aid usually only makes the headlines when some further atrocity
in Bosnia or Romania is in the news. But every day is dangerous for the
aid workers in this young charity as they toil to bring hope to those
caught up in appalling strife. The second charity to benefit operates
close to home. Last October we set up The Herald Foundation for Women's
Health because statistics concerning women's health in this part of the
world are shocking: the worst figures for heart disease; some of the
worst survival rates for various cancers. The wider aim of the
foundation is to raise women's awareness about their health, but our
first project is the establishment of a specialist One-Stop
gynaecological treatment clinic at the Royal Infirmary, and for this we
must raise #100,000.
OUR thanks go to the following who contributed to the event: Vidal
Sassoon; Pretty Polly; Shiseido; United Models; Misty Oldland; Lisa M;
Trebor; Absolut Vodka; Tom Moore Bourbon; Miller Beer; Opel Nera; Graven
Images; Heritage House; Sandy Martin at Branching Out; Timorous
Beasties; Bar 1; Starstruck Sound and Light; Rocksteady Security; The
Lounge, The Living Room and Voodoo Room; The Tramway; Tauntons; Myers;
ACE Refrigeration.

Chicago, Friday
THE paramilitary group linked by news reports to suspects in the
Oklahoma City bombing is part of an anti-government movement which
shares a fascination for a novel in which a fertiliser bomb destroys the
FBI, experts said.
The Michigan Militia, linked with similar groups in at least nine
states, also has been reported to be obsessed by the fate of the Branch
Davidian cult, which set itself aflame, killing 70 members, rather than
surrender to Federal agents in a bloody siege on April 19, 1993 -- two
years to the day of the Oklahoma disaster.
Time Magazine reported that one of the men who rented the van which,
officials said, carried the bomb to the federal building, gave a false
South Dakota driver's licence in the name of a Robert Kling. Kling's
birthday was given as April 19, 1979, the month and day -- if not the
year -- of the Branch Davidian disaster.
''The Michigan Militia started out as a group of basically extreme
libertarians who distrust the government and who focus on gun
ownership,'' said John Nutter, an assistant professor at Michigan State
University.
''In Michigan they have conducted paramilitary training exercises --
they go running around the woods in camouflage with guns.''
Nutter said that while the bombing would seem out of character with
the philosophy of the militias, ''there is a novel, a right-wing, Nazi
fantasy which is a bible of the right-wing movement in which a small
group of 'Aryan mercenaries' attack and destroy the FBI in Washington
with a fertiliser bomb.''
He identified the book as The Turner Diaries by William Pierce.
Authorities have linked the two suspects arrested to the Militia. The
farmhouse raided in Decker, Michigan, was allegedly used by the group.
Nutter said the militia movement operated in several states and was
used as a recruiting ground for the more extreme groups, such as the
Posse Commitatus and the Aryan Nation.
He cited nine states -- Montana, Idaho, Colorado, Michigan, Texas,
Missouri, Tennessee, Florida, and Pennsylvania -- and in those areas the
group is ''shot through with the extreme right-wing.'' It has an
estimated 2000 members in Michigan alone, experts said.
The Michigan Militia also believes that the government intends to wage
war on citizens who refuse to give up their weapons, according to news
reports.
The militia has cited as evidence for this view the assault on the
Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, and the 1992 raid on the cabin
of Randy Weaver in Idaho, in which Weaver's wife and son and a federal
marshal were killed.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Victim 'thrown from window twice'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978764036</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FORMER hotel worker yesterday told the High Court in Glasgow that he
saw a man twice being thrown out of a fourth-floor window.
Mr Raymond Henfry, 28, said he looked into a bedroom during a New Year
party and saw two men pushing Mr Kenneth Syme, 48, from the window. He
claimed the men were Mr Kenneth McGuire, 35, and Mr Michael Fay, 28.
Mr McGuire and Mr Fay deny repeatedly throwing Mr Syme, of Fullers
Gate, Faifley, Clydebank, out of the window of their fourth-floor flat
at Watchmeal Crescent nearby, and murdering him on January 1 this year.
Mr McGuire also denies punching and kicking Mr John Slevin, c/o the
police, to his permananent disfigurement in the flat that night, and
threatening to throw Mr Ian Reid from the window on a previous occasion.
He further denies tying Mr Syme up in plastic bags, hiding him in a
wheelie-bin, and moving him to nearby lock-up garages.
Earlier, Mr Henfry had his plea of not guilty to murder accepted by
the Crown. He admitted helping to move Mr Syme in the wheelie-bin, and
that he attempted to defeat the ends of justice. He will be sentenced at
the end of the trial.
Mr Henfry told the court that when he looked into the bedroom the man
was hanging out head first and trying to hold on to the sides. He said
he ran forward and tried to pull him back by his legs.
He said he was pushed back by Mr McGuire, and Mr Syme disappeared over
the edge. When he looked out, he could see him lying on his back on the
ground.
The former barman said they all rejoined the party for a few drinks in
the living-room before he and Mr Fay went outside. Mr Syme was lying on
his back but was still breathing, and he used his knowledge of first aid
to check for broken bones. Then they carried him back to the bedroom
''to keep him warm''. He was still breathing and they put him on a bed.
Questioned by Mr Ian Duguid, prosecuting, he alleged Mr McGuire came
into the bedroom and shouted: ''What's that bastard still doing here.''
Mr Henfry said: ''He shoved past me and opened the window, grabbed Mr
Syme by the back of his neck and waist and papped him back out of the
window.''
Later, he claimed, Mr McGuire went outside, tied bin bags around Mr
Syme's head and legs, and put him head first into a wheelie-bin and took
him away somewhere.
Mr Henfry told the court that when Mr McGuire came in and threw Mr
Syme back out again he was ''shocked, stunned''.
Asked if anything was said in the bedroom the second time, Mr Henfry
said: ''No, not a word. McGuire just walked back to the living-room as
if nothing had happened.
''I went back to the living-room. I should have bolted. I sat down. I
was shaking.''
He claimed he then saw Mr McGuire kicking and punching Mr Slevin till
he was unconscious.
Asked why he did not get up and leave the party to get help, he said:
''I was in a state of shock. I was frightened of McGuire.''
When he asked Mr McGuire about Mr Syme, he said the accused told him:
''He owed me money.''
Mr Henfry agreed that he then went to another party, but told no-one
about what had happened until interviewed by police the following day
and was jointly charged with the murder.
Cross-examined by Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending, Mr Henfry said he
had recently passed a first aid course with the Territorial Army and
examined Mr Syme the first time he was pushed out the window, and found
no bleeding or fractures.
Mr Findlay: ''So you just carried him back to the same house where he
had been chucked out of a fourth floor window?''
Mr Henfry: ''Yes.''
Mr Findlay: ''Was that your idea of first aid?''
Mr Henfry: ''My idea was to get him to bed to keep him warm. He was
still breathing.''
He denied helping Mr McGuire to put the victim in the wheelie-bin, and
said he only helped to move the bin up a few stairs.
The trial before Lord Osborne continues.

THE most common medication for treating asthma has been outlawed in
athletics.
Two of the most frequently prescribed inhalers, Salbutamol (Ventolin)
and Terbutaline (Bricanyl), are now on a list of substances whose use
would incur a four-year suspension.
The inhalers will only be permitted if competitors have obtained
advance permission directly from the British Athletics Federation.
Because such inhalers are often required urgently, BAF's Scottish
medical officer, Dr Malcolm Brown, has established with the
International Amateur Athletic Federation that permission may,
exceptionally, be obtained retrospectively.
However, permission must be renewed annually. In view of the large
numbers of asthmatics, BAF may attempt to negotiate a blanket renewal
with the IAAF.
BAF spokesman, Mr Tony Ward, said as many as 20% of the British team
use such inhalers.
That figure contrasts with the 8% of Scottish school leavers who
Friends of the Earth say are asthmatics on the basis of the most recent
data.
The statistics suggest Britain's athletes are either exceptionally
prone to asthma, or they believe that being treated as asthmatic confers
certain benefits.

POLICE and fire investigators disclosed yesterday that a fire at an
Edinburgh sauna may have been started deliberately.
The fire caused extensive damage at the Scorpio premises in Albion
Road around 2am, just hours after a court hearing relating to another
sauna, in Iona Street, also owned by Mr Ian Haig.
Around 25 firefighters tackled the fire on the ground floor of a
tenement. Assistant divisional fire officer, Mr Derek Brannan, said that
although it was contained quickly to the rear of the building, it could
have posed real danger to residents of upper flats.
''At that time of night they would be in their beds unaware of what
was going on. We are treating the cause as suspicious. In any case where
a fire is started deliberately it could threaten the lives of innocent
people,'' he added.
Mr Haig declined to comment on how the fire might have been started
and said he would await the full results of the brigade and police
investigation.
''The sauna will be closed for about a week to 10 days'' he added.
His other sauna, the Gemini in Iona Street, also remains closed
pending an appeal by a local resident, Mrs Debra Scanlon, who claims
Edinburgh District Council had acted outside its powers in granting an
entertainment licence for the sauna, knowing that it would be used for a
brothel.
This was the subject of a two-day hearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court
earlier this week, which has been continued to another date.
Counsel for Mr Haig and the district council said the appeal was
irrelevant and partly based on ''scandalous assertions'' in newspaper
articles about his ownership of both saunas, which could not be classed
as evidence in considering grant of a licence.

THE housing market in Aberdeen is slowing down, with prices falling by
about 4% compared with this time last year.
A report by Aberdeen Solicitors' Property Centre shows that there has
been a slight increase in the past three months and the average price
now is #67,934, an increase of #600 on the last quarter of 1994.
However, at this time last year the average was #70,735. The figures
show that UK prices have fallen by only about 1% in the same period.
The areas with the greatest number of ''for sale'' notices are Bridge
of Don, Stonehaven, Portlethen and Newtonhill. Danestone, Ellon, Kemnay
and Monymusk are going against the trend, with slightly fewer properties
on the market.
The average number of houses sold each week this year so far has been
90, a drop of 13 on last year.
''The three factors -- lower prices, an increase in the number on the
register and a slight drop in sales -- confirms evidence from the
previous quarter that there is some slowing down in the local housing
market,'' said ASPC vice-chairman Malcolm Shepherd.
''What we can say, however, is that there is no better time to buy
than now. With prices slightly depressed and a wider choice than for
some years, first-time buyers or people moving to the area will find
some real bargains.''

<HEADLINE>Merger plans could mean closure of nuclear firm's East Kilbride headquarters with loss of 500 jobs Scottish Nuclear's future under threat</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND could lose its own nuclear power firm, Scottish Nuclear, if
Government plans to privatise the industry go-ahead.
Concern is mounting that Scottish Nuclear will be merged with Nuclear
Electric, putting 500 jobs at risk at its East Kilbride headquarters, at
a time when the town is fighting Rolls-Royce plans to axe 600 jobs.
It is believed that the decision to proceed on that basis now requires
only a rubber stamp from the Cabinet next Thursday. It has been bitterly
resisted by Scottish Nuclear in last minute discussions with Ministers
and civil servants.
Mr Adam Ingram, the Labour MP for East Kilbride, where Scottish
Nuclear has its headquarters, said that if the closure of the East
Kilbride Rolls-Royce plant went ahead the town would lose 600 skilled
engineering jobs.
''The possibility of another 500 highly-skilled engineering jobs going
South would be a major body blow, not just to East Kilbride and
Lanarkshire, but to the whole of Scotland's manufacturing economy.
''The Secretary of State and his Ministers remain silent over the
Rolls-Royce issue. It looks as if they have now capitulated over the
Scottish Nuclear issue,'' he said.
Scottish Nuclear was last night understood to be working hard to
maintain its position as an independent Scottish company. It continues
to believe, as do its financial advisers, that it is privatisable as it
stands.
A spokeswoman for Scottish Nuclear said she was not in a position to
make any statement regarding a possible merger with Nuclear Electric.
She said: ''Our progress has been considerable since 1989, and our
figures are much improved. Output has increased and all-round
efficiency, particularly regarding output per head of employee, has
increased dramatically. Profit margins have increased and we are now
seeking the opportunity to operate as a commercial business, which we
feel we have managed to do in Government hands, and would like to have
the freedom to do that now in the public sector.''
Some industry commentators have pointed out that the eight-nothing
proposal, which a merger would result in, would give Nuclear Electric
23% of the market share, flying in the face of attempts by the
industry's regulator to break up the generating capacity of National
Power and PowerGen, the two main non-nuclear generators.
Labour Trade and Industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said: ''I am
thoroughly alarmed by the way things have moved in the last few days. If
Ian Lang loses this one then he really should be driven out.
''The whole privatisation agenda is being driven by its (the
Government's) desperation to raise #3,500m from selling off the nuclear
industry in the shortest possible time.
''That is no way to determine the fate of such a sensitive industry
or, particularly, one of the few remaining major companies based in
Scotland.''
It is believed that a holding company may be formed with its
headquarters in Glasgow. But Mr Wilson, MP for Cunninghame North,
dismissed this as ''a fig leaf''.
He said: ''My fundamental opposition is to privatisation. The question
of how it is done is secondary, but clearly this would be the worst
possible option for Scottish Nuclear, and my constituents at
Hunterston.''
Until recently, it was thought that nuclear privatisation would stay
on the back burner until after the General Election. However, in the
absence of a Post Office sell-off, Ministers have been increasingly
anxious to find other possible sales.
Scottish Nuclear has advocated a ''four-four'' formula, based on it
taking over Nuclear Electric's two most northerly Advanced Gas Reactors
(AGRs) to give two companies an equal number of stations.
However, it now seems that this has been rejected as the basis for
privatisation in favour of a single company which, the Government's
advisers have told it, could be prepared for flotation within a year.
Former Tory Scottish Office Minister, Mr Allan Stewart, said last
night that he would be ''very concerned'' if Scottish Nuclear was merged
with Nuclear Electric.
The MP for Eastwood added: ''By far the best decision would be the
four-four option, a Nuclear North and a Nuclear South, with the
headquarters of the northern group being at East Kilbride and being
controlled in Scotland.
''I think that is sensible, not only in Scottish terms, but also in
terms of providing competition. Otherwise you get a monopoly. The
eight-nothing proposal would be unacceptable in Scotland.''

BARONESS Thatcher has been appointed to the Order of the Garter, the
highest order of chivalry within the Queen's personal gift, Buckingham
Palace has announced.
Lady Thatcher will be installed in the order, founded by Edward III in
1348, at a traditional ceremony at St George's Chapel, Windsor, in June.
Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to conquer Mount Everest, also was
appointed to the Order, which traditionally has 24 members.
The two appointments fill vacancies left by the deaths of Lord
Shackleton in September last year, and Sir Cennydd Traherne in January.
A Palace spokesman said: ''The Queen has been graciously pleased to
appoint the Baroness Thatcher to be a Lady Companion of the Most Noble
Order of the Garter, and Sir Edmund Hillary to be a Knight companion of
the Most Noble Order of the Garter.''
Lady Thatcher is the seventh former Prime Minister to be appointed to
the order -- her predecessors were Sir Winston Churchill, Earl Attlee,
the Earl of Avon, Lord Wilson, Lord Callaghan, and Sir Edward Heath.
New Zealand explorer Sir Edmund, 75, is the second member of the
successful Everest expedition in 1953 to become a Companion of the Order
-- its leader Lord Hunt was appointed in 1979.
Lady Thatcher, 69, is only the second Lady Companion of the order.
Lady Thatcher's office issued a brief statement which said she was
''deeply honoured and absolutely delighted''.

<HEADLINE>Father's school plea refused by judge</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978764043</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A JUDGE yesterday refused to grant a 72-year-old father a court order
to ensure that his son is kept at a fee-paying school for his entire
secondary education.
Lord Gill, at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, said that retired
university lecturer George Clayton's affection for the boy had ''become
a pre-occupation, particularly in the matter of education''.
Mr Clayton has put #45,000 in a trust to meet the cost of future
education fees for his son.
The judge granted Mr Clayton a divorce from his 40-year-old wife Rowan
but he awarded her custody of their 11-year-old son, who is in his final
year at a state primary school.
Mr Clayton, who lectured in genetics at Edinburgh University for about
30 years, met Rowan in 1977 and they married in Canada in 1982. The
following year, Mrs Clayton returned to Scotland where the son was born.
However, in 1988, she left her husband with whom she had been living
on Seil Island, near Oban, and moved to Edinburgh with her son.
Mrs Clayton, of Rosemount Buildings, is studying full-time for a PhD
at Edinburgh University.
In 1990, Mr Clayton also moved to Edinburgh.
Lord Gill said: ''He did so in order to have better access to the
child. That is when the problems began.''
Mr Clayton, of East Castle Road, Edinburgh, had been concerned about
health issues facing his son and was anxious that he should be
effectively educated about Aids. He sent his wife copies of literature
on Aids, including articles from the British Medical Journal, when the
boy was six or seven-years-old.
He was also concerned about the presence of lead in his son's drinking
water and offered his wife a loan to let her replace the lead in her
plumbing system at her house.
Mr Clayton described his wife's refusal to give the boy fluoride to
combat tooth decay as ''completely irrational''.
He also criticised his wife for having an occasional cigarette and
disapproved of her keeping cats, which he regarded as a source of fleas
and dirt.
Lord Gill said Mr Clayton also disapproved of his wife having taken in
a lodger at one time and expressed concern that his son might be exposed
to sexual deviants.
Mr Clayton wrote to his son's primary school, Tollcross, in Edinburgh,
over his concern to protect the boy from sexual deviants.
The judge noted: ''He explained that the basis of his concern was that
Tollcross was not a particularly exclusive area, that there were two or
three unpleasant pubs and a brothel near the school and that there were
odd characters around the area.''
Mr Clayton had been determined that his son should receive his
secondary education at a fee-paying school.
Mrs Clayton's general preference was for her son to be educated in the
state system.
But during a phone conversation between the couple, Mrs Clayton
realised her husband might compromise by agreeing to the boy attending
George Heriot's School.
The boy has now passed the entrance exam and Mr Clayton has accepted
that.
''His focus of concern is now to ensure that the boy should not be
removed from Heriot's,'' said Lord Gill.
He added: ''Mrs Clayton does not intend to remove the boy from
Heriot's. She realises that if she were ever to do so, Mr Clayton would
probably go to law.
''Nevertheless, she does not exclude the possibility that a change of
school may at some time be appropriate. In my view, that is a realistic
attitude.''
The couple had drawn up a separation agreement, which contained a
clause that both parents should agree on any major decision affecting
their son's welfare, including education.
Lord Gill said that arrangement was not working satisfactorily and was
not in the best interests of the boy.

<HEADLINE>Permit for pupil to hit classmates Fury at psychologists over boy's 'contract'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978764044</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN expelled pupil was to be allowed back into class if he followed
certain guidelines by education psychologists: he should not hit fellow
pupils more than seven times a week.
There were other rules: he should refuse to obey teachers no more than
seven times a week; swear at them no more than three times a week; and
at other pupils no more than six times a week.
The disclosure came from a teacher's union, and provoked a furious
row.
One Tory MP called for the restoration of caning after the boy's story
was recounted at the conference of the National Association of
Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers at Eastbourne.
The union's general secretary, Mr Nigel de Gruchy, said he thought the
incident was ''the ultimate in 'trendy Wendy' soft so-called progressive
attitudes to discipline in school''.
Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett said the ''contract''
suggested by the psychologists was ''clearly unacceptable''. He said:
''No teacher can do their job, nor other pupils learn, in circumstances
where adults not only condone but sanction bad behaviour.''
Mr Jared Johnson, NASUWT secretary at Ashington, Northumberland, said
the contract, which was never implemented after teachers protested, was
proposed for a boy in his county after he was expelled for a week for
causing disruption.
The 10-year-old's behaviour was so bad several parents said they would
withdraw their children if he were allowed to return.
In one week, the boy, known only as John, disobeyed teachers 16 times,
swore at them seven times, swore at other pupils 12 times and assaulted
fellow pupils 14 times.
Under the proposed contract he was to be permitted back into class and
allowed to play computer games at home for an extra hour a week if he
agreed to the new ''restrictions''.
Teachers were appalled at the idea that the boy should virtually be
allowed to misbehave, said Mr Johnson. ''Imagine trying to tell a mum
'Sorry, your daughter has a fractured skull. But, really, she is only
the sixth pupil John has hit this week'.''
The boy was allowed back into school on the understanding that his
behaviour was monitored, with no specific targets.
The suggested arrangement brought immediate condemnation from MPs
including the chairman of the Tory back-bench education committee, Mr
James Pawsey, who called for the cane to be brought back.
''There are some times where the cane is a very useful instrument.
It's a deterrent. I don't see how teachers can operate in a classroom
where a boy has a licence to hit his fellows up to seven times a week,''
he said.
Education spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, Mr Don Foster, said any
such contract would be ''ludicrous'' and added: ''I've never heard of a
case like it and I'm horrified. It's absolutely appalling.''
He called for the Government to bring back indefinite exclusion, under
which schools can send children home for as long as they like.
Tory David Shaw, MP for Dover, said: ''Bullying is very big problem in
schools and it's time we stopped it . . . it strikes me that this is a
case where the parents and child need to experience some very tough
discipline.''
Northumberland County Council's education director denied the
existence of any ''contract'' which would have allowed the boy to hit
other pupils.
While Mr Christopher Tipple would not say that the ''very disturbing''
story was fabricated, he said it must have arisen from a misreading of
the facts.
''We have no record of the contract as described here,'' he said,
explaining that psychologists do try to improve behaviour by brokering
so-called contracts with pupils but only in consultation with parents
and teachers.
However, he stressed: ''The only acceptable target as far as violent
behaviour is concerned must be its complete disappearance. I have
checked with our educational psychologists who would place all
contractual arrangements with pupils on file and no such details are
recorded.
''If it appears, following further investigation, that an
inappropriate contract exists, then psychologists will, of course, be
reminded that no violent acts are acceptable.''

STAR Trek actor Jimmy Doohan, who played Scotty, yesterday visited the
exhibition inspired by the cult television series at Edinburgh's City
Art Centre and staked a claim to a Scottish heritage, writes GRAEME
MURRAY.
Mr Doohan, 75, born in Canada, said he had ''50% Scottish blood'' from
his Glaswegian mother's side of the family. His grandfather was also a
Scot.
He posed on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise, the Transporter
Deck, much to the delight of avid Trekkies who had travelled from afar
to see him.
Representatives of the Scottish Star Trek Club were also on hand in
make-up and full crew member costumes.
Mr Doohan took Scotty's accent from an Aberdonian army room-mate, and
said he ''always wanted to go to Aberdeen and would go one day''. He was
presented with a bottle of malt whisky by Trekkie Donald Naismith, on
behalf of Edinburgh District Council.

A WOMAN who repeatedly stabbed her lover as he lay naked on a bed was
yesterday jailed for six years by a court in Palma, Majorca, for
attempted murder.
Jacqueline Smith, 36, from Greenock, who has been in custody for more
than 13 months following the attack in which her victim received
near-fatal knife wounds, was told of the sentence at the island's prison
by her lawyer.
On the last day of the trial, just before Easter, a statement from
Joseph Lancaster, 68, from Preston, Lancashire, who was too ill to
travel to Majorca, was read by the panel of three judges. In it he
claimed that he and Smith were lovers before the attack in a bedroom at
his apartment on the edge of Palma in March last year.
In court, Smith claimed that she only went to the apartment
occasionally to help clean it. She insisted that she had found Mr
Lancaster naked on his bed surrounded by pornographic magazines,
''playing with himself''.
Smith denied that they were lovers and told the court he had said:
''Come on Jackie. Show me what you do to your boyfriend.''
She admitted pushing him away and running to the kitchen where she
picked-up a knife and then returned to the bedroom. ''I wasn't going to
do anything to him. I just wanted to frighten him,'' she said.
However, Smith claimed, Lancaster then attacked her and he was wounded
in the struggle.
The state prosecutor, who had demanded a 12-year sentence, told the
court: ''There was only one thing on this woman's mind -- to cause death
or injury to Mr Lancaster.''

A GIRL in care from an Orkney family ran away three times from foster
parents, a children's panel heard yesterday.
On the first occasion she was away from home overnight, the panel,
sitting in Kirkwall, was told. Highland region social worker Mrs Sheena
Rainnie said that the girl, who was found the next morning, had then
made allegations that she had been assaulted by her foster parents.
Police had investigated, found the claims to be malicious and taken no
further action, Mrs Rainnie said.
The girl was reported missing for the second time after she was placed
at a new foster home, she said.
Officers found her a short time later, but she disappeared again while
they were still at the house and was found in the early hours of the
morning by security guards on an industrial estate.
The girl told the panel that she now wanted to be allowed to return to
her family in Orkney. ''I want to go home to be with mum,'' she said.
Social worker Mr Paul Hersee said that this represented a radical
change in the girl's wishes. ''She herself has been saying until quite
recently that she doesn't want to see her mother,'' he said. It's
important that we proceed cautiously.''
Panel members agreed that an independent ''safeguarder'' should be
appointed to assess the girl's views and report back to a continued
hearing in three weeks' time.
Her mother told the hearing: ''Suddenly there's hope again for her.
I'm not interested in pressurising children -- I'm not interested in
having a child in my home unless she wants to be there.''

<TEXT>
TWO lorryloads of sheep were turned away from the quayside at Dover
yesterday after Government inspectors decreed the animals had
insufficient headroom and a third was sent back for being overloaded.
The quayside checks at Dover were carried out by Ministry of
Agriculture officials amid a noisy, but peaceful, demonstration against
live animal exports.
Five lorries went through with no arrests.
The lorries turned back at Dover were escorted by police motorcycle
outriders through shouting protesters waiting outside the docks.
A representative of exporter Peter Gilder denied the lorries turned
back were his, but Ms Clare Baumberg of Compassion in World Farming,
said: ''He has hired the freight ship and he should make sure the
animals are treated well.''
An RSPCA official was present at the inspection, and a spokeswoman
said: ''It is depressing that hauliers are still disobeying the current
rules, even with the high level of public concern, and when we would
like to see even more stringent regulations.''
However, seven lorries carrying calves went through as more than 50
people, among them former Tory Minister Alan Clark, demonstrated.
Mr Clark yelled at the police: ''What the hell do you think you are
doing -- do you have no shame whatever in the task you are performing?
''This isn't law enforcement -- it's not crime prevention. You are
simply protecting the profits of a lot of people in the livestock
industry.''
Kent police said: ''If anyone, ex-Cabinet Ministers or otherwise, jump
over the barrier they will be put back very quickly.''
There was also a trouble-free demonstration at Brightlingsea, but
animal rights activists accused the police of inflaming Thursday's
violent clashes at the Essex port by sending residents threatening
letters. The letters, sent to every Brightlingsea resident, warned of
arrest if anyone demonstrated unlawfully.
Brightlingsea resident Mike Yardley, a writer and former army officer,
said Thursday's violence had alienated many in the town.
''People have a right to express their views, but I think it's a great
shame that protesters have not been more disciplined,'' he said.
He urged the Brightlingsea Against Live Exports organistion to reform.
But it was forced to disbanded to avoid the threat of the Public Order
Act after police sent letters to every Brightlingsea resident
threatening them with arrest if they demonstrated unlawfully.
Protesters blamed the police's use of the Act for inflaming the
situation.
''It has attracted elements that want to confront the police and have
nothing to do with our protest,'' said former BALE member Sue Wheeler.
* Pc Mike Hammond, 28, who was hit in the face by a paint-filled egg
at Brightlingsea on Thursday, will be off duty for at least a week,
police said.

THE brother of freed Scottish hostage Calum Murray said yesterday that
he and 15 others had been forced to march the width of Sierra Leone by
their rebel captors.
Mr Iain Murray's 25-year-old brother, a voluntary worker, was released
on Thursday after being held hostage for almost six months by the
Revolutionary United Front.
Mr Calum Murray and the other hostages then walked for 16 days to the
border with Guinea.
Teacher Iain Murray also praised members of the Metropolitan Police
who negotiated behind the scenes in Sierra Leone.
''We cannot thank them and everybody else enough. We knew that the
Metropolitan Police had sent a team because they are specially trained
to negotiate with rebels,'' said Mr Murray before leaving the family
home in Gress, Lewis, to fly to London.
Mr Calum Murray, a civil engineer, and the other five British hostages
released on Thursday are expected to arrive in London early today from
Conakry, the capital of Guinea.
The freed hostages were yesterday being looked after by Red Cross
volunteers. A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red
Cross, Rene-Luc Thevoz, said: ''We have a doctor and nurse accompanying
them. From what we heard yesterday their state of health seems to be
satisfactory. They are very tired, exhausted, that's for sure.''
The family had received several reports of his release by his RUF
captives, only for their hopes to be dashed, said Mr Murray.
They had hoped that Mr Murray , and his fellow volunteer worker with
Voluntary Service Overseas, Robert D'Cruz, would be released around this
time because the heavy rains due in May would have made travel in the
bush virtually impossible.
''We knew two weeks ago that he was walking towards the border -- it
was a very anxious time for us,'' said Mr Murray.
''We have been expecting this news, but it has been difficult waiting
to hear because we have had disappointments before. We know that a
foreign aid organisation was instrumental in the negotiations for his
release and that the Foreign Office and VSO were also working behind the
scenes.''
The Labour MP for the Western Isles, Calum MacDonald, hailed the
police negotiators as the key players in securing the hostages' release.
Meanwhile, one of the other freed Britons told his wife over the phone
that his months in capticity had been ''an interesting and fulfilling
experience''.
Mr Peter White, 49, of Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire, who was working
as a mine manager when he was captured in January, told his wife Lesley:
''Don't worry, I'll explain everything. I'll see you soon.''
Mrs White had been with her engineer husband at the time of the kidnap
as he worked for the Sierra Rutile Mining Company. She said that on
January 20, her husband heard gunfire and bombs going off near the mine.
He went to check on friends and fellow workers and fell into the hands
of the rebels. Mrs White and others fled the war zone in a 21-hour
journey on a barge to the capital Freetown. She then flew back to the
family home, not knowing if he was alive or dead.

SECURITY at the State Hospital in Carstairs is to be tightened to
protect staff and prevent drugs and weapons being smuggled in.
All staff and visitors to the hospital will have to pass through an
airport-style scanning device. The equipment is to be installed this
summer at a cost of #200,000, paid for by the Scottish Office.
Yesterday, the hospital's general manager, Mr Dick Manson, said that
the hospital had sought advice on security from Strathclyde Police and
the Scottish Prison Service.
He was reluctant to put an exact figure on the number of breaches of
security over the last year, but said there had been very few. However,
he said in the past patients had bullied staff into bringing in alcohol,
drugs and weapons.
The hospital's chairman, Mr Philip Hamilton-Grierson, added that the
issue of security had to be constantly revised.
''We are determined to make sure that no visitor, member of staff, or
member of the public, can be put at risk through anyone being
compromised or forced to smuggle-in any contraband items.
''We are committed to making the hospital's environment as safe as
possible,'' he said.

PATRICK BROGAN in Washington
THE FBI arrested one suspect in the Oklahoma bombing yesterday and
another surrendered. Both were reported to be members of a neo-Nazi
group.
The identikit pictures of Timothy McVeigh, 27, and Terry Nichols, had
been issued on Thursday.
Nichols surrendered in Kansas. As he was being arrested by FBI agents,
police laid siege to the isolated farm of his brother James in Michigan.
Michigan television showed dramatic film of heavily armed police
surrounding a white farm house where it was believed at the time that
the brothers were hiding.
The first arrest was announced by Attorney-General Janet Reno.
McVeigh had been picked up for speeding at Perry, 60 miles north of
Oklahoma, one hour after the bombing of the federal building on
Wednesday.
He was then held in custody in the county jail on an arms charge: he
was carrying a gun.
Mrs Reno said the FBI did not identify him as one of the suspects
until yesterday. McVeigh is a Michigan gun dealer.
McVeigh was later transferred from Perry to Oklahoma by helicopter to
face a local judge. An angry crowd screamed insults as he was brought
out of the local jail under heavy escort.
Mrs Reno said there was a ''strong likelihood'' that others were
involved but would not name any suspect groups.
The suspects were reported to have been connected to a paramilitary
white-supremacist group calling itself the Michigan Militia, one of the
far-right neo-Nazi groups which consider themselves at war with the
government.
McVeigh and the Nichols brothers were said to have been expelled, or
to have left the militia, or perhaps to have formed a subdivision,
called the Patriots.
The Michigan Militia is one of many similar groups. It has close links
to the Montana Militia which is part of the Aryan Nation, the best-known
neo-Nazi group in the country.
The guiding principle of all these organisations is detestation of the
federal government, which they believe is a Jewish conspiracy against
the true, white, Anglo-Saxon and Germanic America.
They are sharply opposed to gun control, including last year's ban on
some automatic weapons. They claimed that the attack on the Branch
Davidians in Waco Texas exactly two years before the Oklahoma City
bombing was an example of government tyranny.
The Michigan Militia is said to conduct training exercises in Junction
City, Kansas, which is where the two suspects rented a 22ft Ryder
company removal truck on April 17. The truck was packed with up to two
tons of explosives.
The key to the case was the truck itself. Two blocks from the blast
federal investigators located part of the rental van's axle that
contained its Vehicle Identification Number.
Federal agents were then able to trace the bomb van to a Ryder rental
office at Elliott's Body Shop in Junction City, Kansas, on Wednesday,
the day of the explosion. Employees who rented the truck to two white
men on Monday afternoon gave the FBI detailed descriptions that artists
were able to turn into sketches.
The Attorney General said earlier that the crime was now considered an
act of domestic, American terrorism, not an act of international
terrorism.
President Clinton said the arrests made him confident ''we will solve
this crime in its entirety'' and the bombers will face the death
penalty.
Asked about emerging evidence suggesting the suspects were American
and possibly members of an extremist group, Mr Clinton also said: ''I
have never and the Justice Department has never said that it was a
foreign threat . . . Even though this is a positive development, this
investigation still has a lot of work to be done on it.''
Of any suspects remaining at large, Mr Clinton said: ''We will find
them, we will convict them and we will seek the death penalty for
them.''
In New York, sources said police had questioned Asad Siddiqy, a cab
driver from the New York City borough of Queens, who arrived in Oklahoma
City about an hour before the blast.
The FBI, federal firearms agents, and Dallas police took a calendar,
address book, and bag of clothes from a flat on Wednesday night,
according to a search warrant provided by a man who identified himself
only as Siddiqy's brother and would give no personal information about
their occupation or nationality.
The man said he was questioned by the FBI. He denied that he or his
brother had anything to do with the bombing.
The Jordanian-American who was detained at Heathrow and sent back to
Washington has been released. An FBI spokesman said he was being very
co-operative, and was returning to his home in Oklahoma City. Sources
now say that his luggage, which was found at Rome airport, did not
contain bomb making equipment, merely pliers, a hammer and other tools.
Three other Arabs who were detained in Texas and Oklahoma City are
also reportedly not being considered suspects, though possibly they
might be witnesses.
In Oklahoma City, the official death toll reached 65, but rescuers
said they feared that up to 100 bodies remained in the wreckage of the
federal building.
Forty-eight hours after the explosion, hopes of finding any more
survivors were slight, but the operation continued on the basis that
there could be people trapped in pockets deep in the rubble.
Digging is a slow business because the whole structure might collapse
at any moment. Much of Thursday was devoted to shoring up the building.
Then, in the evening, the upper layers of the section that collapsed
were lifted, and by early yesterday another 21 bodies had been
recovered.
The centre had 30 children on its books, at least six of whom were
absent on Wednesday. The bodies of 12 dead children have been recovered.
Among those still missing are the centre's director and her two-year-old
daughter.
An FBI spokesman said that the bomb used weighed several thousand
pounds. He would not say what it was made of, but news reports suggest
that it was concocted of nitrogen fertiliser and fuel oil.
If it was indeed 4000lb, it would be the biggest terrorist bomb on
record.
The compound is a low-level explosive, meaning that it causes less
damage than standard dynamite, let alone modern explosives like Semtex.
However a two-ton bomb, evidently, can do immense damage.
The bomb used at the New York World Trade Centre in 1993 was about
half a ton.
At the White House, officials announced that President Clinton would
go to Oklahoma City for prayer services tomorrow.
* THE limp, bloodied baby held by a firefighter in a photograph that
stirred the world has been identified as a girl who was a year old just
the day before the bombing.
Baylee Almon's picture brought home the horror of the scene to
millions who saw it on the front pages of newspapers nationwide.
Her mother, Aren Almon, 22, had a tearful meeting with the police
officer and firefighter who had tried to rescue her daughter.
Baylee was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency medical
technicians, said firefighter Chris Fields, whose attempt to rescue the
baby was captured by an amateur photographer and transmitted worldwide
by The Associated Press.
Baylee was believed to be in the day care centre when it was
devastated by the bomb.
''If they do catch these criminals, maybe they'll see this and see how
much they've hurt me and hurt my family and hurt other people,'' Ms
Almon said. ''They destroyed our lives, and our homes.''

LEADERS of the Paisley North Constituency Labour Party have given
local MP, Mrs Irene Adams, their backing in the controversy over
allegations of impropriety concerning a community business at Ferguslie
Park in Paisley.
The office-bearers of the CLP offered their support after a private
meeting last night -- amid reports that the local party may try to
suspend the Craigielea branch of the party.
Mr Tommy Williams, chairman of the Paisley North CLP, said they gave
their ''fullest confidence and complete support'' to Mrs Adams.
Earlier this week, Mrs Adams tabled questions in the Commons, alleging
that the publicly-funded FCB Enterprise Security Ltd was being used as a
front for ''illegal activities''. She has further alleged manipulation
of the local Craigielea Labour branch. Mrs Adams has said the two claims
are separate issues.
Mr Williams added: ''We support any attempts to clear up any
allegations surrounding Ferguslie Community Business Security.
''This Labour party believes that any accusations regarding the
functioning of the Labour party will be dealt with internally by the
party. The office-bearers of this constituency are particularly unhappy
about unofficial press and television statements regarding Labour Party
business.
''We pledge continued support for our excellent, hard-working MP and
will recommend to our executive and CLP that appropriate action be taken
against anyone we feel who has brought the Labour Party into disrepute,
under Labour Party rules.''
His closing comments have been linked with moves to suspend the
Craigielea branch.
The issue of suspension is due to be discussed at the full meeting of
the CLP next Wednesday. The branch was investigated last year after
claims that it was not holding enough meetings or keeping members
informed about branch business. It was allowed to operate on the
condition that it strictly adhered to party rules.
However, claims that it is not holding regular monthly meetings have
surfaced again.

THIS is the 10-point ''Strategy for Tory Revival'' announced by Mr
Stewart at the Eastwood Conservative Association AGM last night:
1) Avoid Scapegoats: When any organisation faces setbacks, there is an
inevitable tendency to look for scapegoats . . . It enables everybody
else to justify their own position.
2) People's Market Economy: Technological and economic change is
extremely rapid. We live increasingly in a global economy. Governments
have much less control of events than has been the case in the past. Our
pro-enterprise policies must focus on the self-employed and small
businesses.
3) Boost for Housing Market: Nobody wants to see a return to
bubble-economy years when house prices spiralled out of control. But
reasonable confidence in the housing market is essential to consumer
confidence. The Treasury has sharply cut the value of the tax
concessions on owner occupation . . . These cuts should be reversed
either now or following announcement soon in the November Budget.
4) VAT on Fuel: The imposition of VAT on fuel at the full rate was not
only extremely unpopular, it was also economically doubtful. The total
spent on domestic fuel is variable for most households. But a proportion
is essential. That points to a commitment to hold the VAT rate at half
the standard rate.
5) Keep Sterling Floating: In the past, we have thrown billions of
pounds in sustaining the unsustainable. Except for limited technical
reasons, we should not endeavour to support a particular rate.
6) A Common, not a Single, Currency: I strongly support the Prime
Minister's idea of a Common European Currency. That would mean the
countries or companies which wished to go into such a mechanism would do
so. It would not, however, undermine the ability of individual
governments which chose to retain their own currencies equally from
doing so.
7) No to Qualified Majority Voting: Over the past two weeks, we have
seen the huge advantage of retaining a veto on European policies. That
means we should support no move towards further qualified majority
voting within the EU.
8) Tackle the Demonstrators Head-on: We have seen an extremely nasty
tendency all over the country, including within Eastwood. It is the
development of highly-organised, mobile, hard-left groups who will latch
on to local protests in a concerted effort to undermine society. We must
ensure first that they are not supported by the taxpayer, as seems to be
the case at present, through benefits. Second, we need to develop a
nationally-organised flying squad especially trained to assist local
police facing such demonstrations.
9) The Conservative Whip: It is extremely unfortunate that nine
Conservatives do not currently have the Conservative Whip. It is surely
right to approach the group on an individual basis to see whether the
impasse can be resolved.
10) Northern Ireland: What is absolutely essential is that any
eventual package put forward for Northern Ireland is with the support of
Northern Ireland's elected representatives in the House of Commons.

<HEADLINE>Top Tory warns of electoral wipe-out Slump blamed on bad policies</HEADLINE>

THE backlash from defeat in local elections caught up with Scottish
Conservatives yesterday when former Minister, Mr Allan Stewart, broke
ranks to claim the Tories had been punished for ignoring the electorate.
He predicted an electoral wipe-out for the party in Scotland if there
was no change of course -- a claim which was in stark contrast to the
official line that presentation rather than policy was at fault, and
that party disunity over Europe had been the major factor.
In a move calculated to mollify his own constituency activists in
advance of last night's annual meeting in Eastwood, Mr Stewart seized
the forum of a BBC Scotland radio interview to say that the official
explanation was wrong, and that bad policies -- notably VAT on domestic
fuel and tax increases -- lay behind the Tories' rejection by the
electorate.
For much of yesterday the Conservative Party leadership in Scotland
seemed at a loss to counter his criticisms. Several leading figures were
unavailable for comment, including besieged chairman, Sir Michael Hirst,
who was said to be ''taking some personal time'' away from his party
duties.
Tracked down by The Herald to an opening ceremony at Dundonald Castle
near Kilmarnock, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang was dismissive of the
attack on policies by Mr Stewart. ''Allan can't believe that,'' said Mr
Lang. ''He served loyally on the Government for several years supporting
those policies until just a few weeks ago.''
Informed that Mr Stewart had specifically criticised VAT on fuel and
increased personal taxation, he responded: ''If he is calling for lower
taxes, of course that is our policy, but it can only be contemplated
when the Chancellor judges that the time is right to resume our progress
in that area, which I hope will not be before too long.''
On VAT on fuel, Mr Lang said: ''All members of the Government
supported that as a necessary part of the programme to get the borrowing
requirement down and the budget back towards balance, and it has been
virtually offset by reduced electricity prices with, of course,
substantial additional assistance for those on low incomes.''
The president of the party's voluntary wing, SCUA, Mr David McLetchie,
said last night: ''Allan Stewart voices the legitimate concerns of many
grassroots Conservatives as to the direction that the party and the
Government are going in. We require clear articulation of what the party
stands for, what it has achieved, and where it is going.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson called Mr Stewart's
comments ''a savage indictment of John Major.'' He added: ''His remarks
drive a coach and horse throught the Tory spin doctors' attempts to
blame the Scottish election results on the Euro-rebels.
''His breathtaking candour stands in stark contrast to the
buck-passing we have seen from Ian Lang and Michael Hirst. As Allan
Stewart said, the root of the problem is the unpopularity of the
Government and its policies. People want a change and a new Labour
Government.''
Mr Stewart had told the Good Morning Scotland programme: ''The unitary
results reflected dissillusion at national, that is to say central
Government, level. There was no criticism of Ian Lang and his team
coming across on the doorsteps at all.
''I think the appearance of the Government being blown off course is
at the root of the problem. People are quick to tell you that they want
the Government to govern.
''I think there have been a few clear setbacks. VAT on domestic fuel
is obviously one. The increases in taxation in the pipeline are another.
These, of course, could be reversed and I think should be reversed at
the earliest opportunity.
''I am not saying that disunity over Europe was not an issue, but it
wasn't by any means the most crucial issue. Nobody was saying they were
not voting Conservative because of that.
''There was a feeling on some issues such as VAT on domestic fuel that
the Government have not listened to people. Disilluision and discontent
was not with the party machine, it was not with the Scottish Office, it
was on national issues.''
Mr Stewart, who was forced to resign after an incident involving
anti-motorway protestors in his constituency, confirmed that he was
making his comments because of the likelihood that if it maintained its
present course his party would be wiped out in Scotland at the next
General Election.
Last night, The Herald found a strong level of support for Mr
Stewart's views among members of the Eastwood Conservative Association
as they arrived for their annual meeting in Newton Mearns.
Mr Jack Addison, a candidate who was defeated in Giffnock North in the
local elections, said: ''He is right. I can tell you from bitter
experience that it is not just one issue, it is the whole lot. It is
right across the board. I agree with him 100%.''
A woman member, who did not wish to be named, said: ''I am sure Mr
Stewart is right. Some of the policies are wrong, for example on the
care of elderly people -- nobody should be making profits out of the
elderly sick.''
However, some members disagreed with Mr Stewart's outburst. One man,
who did not give his name, said: ''I do not think it does the party much
good. He would be better keeping these views to himself.''
As Mr Stewart himself arrived for the meeting, The Herald told him of
Mr Lang's response to his statements, namely that Mr Stewart could not
believe what he had reportedly said because he had supported the
Government's policies as a Scottish Office Minister.
Mr Stewart said: ''I am supporting the policies. My tone is supportive
and positive, it is not destructive. What I am talking about is the
development of policies in a positive way. The election results showed a
deep disillusionment among people and we have to address that problem.''
Asked if he felt the Government was not listening enough to voters, he
replied: ''That is what we have got to do.''
He put up a 10-point plan for reversing Tory fortunes to his
constituency association last night. He said the Scottish Conservatives
had confounded the pundits in 1992, adding: ''After the local elections
results this year we must now again put forward a calm and considered
reaction with positive proposals for the future.''
Most of these were mainstream Tory approaches, he said, but his
insistence that some specific policies had cost the party dear appeared
to amount to a clear attempt to distance hiself from the Government he
recently served.
Only on constitutional change did he refuse to be drawn on whether his
party should be prepared to move towards the apparent views of the
electorate.
His comments yesterday appear to set up an increasingly stormy
Scottish party conference in Glasgow next month. The agenda is already
drawn up, but the party will come under pressure to allow some form of
debate which will act as a safety valve for disgruntled activists to let
off steam.

ARMED police swooped on an Edinburgh hotel after a Romeo guest used
the name of one of Britian's most wanted men as an alias when he booked
in for an overnight stay.
The man arrived at the Trust House Forte Post House Hotel near the zoo
on Thursday night with a female companion and booked in under the name
of Scott Anderson.
All appeared normal until an eagle-eyed member of staff noticed a
striking resemblance to a murder suspect featured in a recent edition of
the BBC television series Crimewatch.
The hotel alerted Lothian and Borders Police who in turn contacted
their colleagues on the West Mercia force who had featured in the
programme.
The Worcestershire-based force were able to confirm that, yes they
were indeed anxious to trace a Scott Anderson in connection with the
brutal stabbing of 28-year-old Mark Garret outside a pub in Frankley,
north Worcestershire, last month.
Murder squad detectives had warned the public not to approach him.
That was good enough for Lothian and Borders. Within minutes officers
of the armed response unit had surrounded the hotel and sealed off any
escape route the suspected killer may take.
The room occupied by Scott Anderson and friend was surrounded by
police with guns and the suspect ordered to come out. Only then did the
officers discover it was the wrong Scott Anderson. After proving his
real identity to the police, the red-faced businessman, who lives in the
nearby area of Ravelston, was allowed to return to his room.
The police spokesman said: ''The man confirmed he had used a false
name whilst booking in at the hotel for an overnight stay.''
The embarrassed businessman, who was traced by The Herald, was staying
tightlipped about the incident at his Edinburgh premises yesterday.
A spokeswoman for the hotel chain said: ''The guest was reported to
the police as a result of his resemblance to an individual wanted on a
recent edition of Crimewatch UK. Police later found it had been a case
of mistaken identity, but praised our staff for their response.''
The hotel spokeswoman said no other residents at the hotel had been
affected by the police visit.

A YOUNG tearaway was allowed back into class after education
psychologists suggested he should not hit fellow pupils more than seven
times a week, it was claimed yesterday. The boy's story was recounted at
the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers
conference at Eastbourne where the union's general secretary, Mr Nigel
de Gruchy, said he thought the incident was ''the ultimate in 'trendy
Wendy' soft so-called progressive attitudes to discipline in school''.
Shadow education secretary David Blunkett said the ''contract''
suggested by the psychologists was ''clearly unacceptable''.

LORD and Lady Spencer are living apart ''for the forseeable future'',
solicitors for the couple confirmed last night.
The statement followed a report overnight which said that Lord
Spencer, 30, brother of the Princess of Wales, and his wife were to
separate.
The decision to live apart was taken earlier this year and was
entirely amicable in every respect, the statement said. No decisions had
been made concerning the marriage.
But it added: ''That is not to say a separation may not become
permanent but both parties sincerely hope that this will not be the
case.''
The solicitors said that after much ''recent, unwelcome, and
intolerable speculation'', the couple had asked that the joint statement
be made.
Lady Spencer, 29, is being treated for an eating disorder and a drink
problem in a private clinic. The couple, who have four children, married
in 1989.

SCOTRAIL has had to compensate thousands of passengers after a
disastrous year for punctuality. The number of late trains on suburban
lines was so high in the first 12 months of reorganisation that it
triggered discounts to season ticket holders under the Citizen's
Charter.
Complaints about the service from the public have also risen
dramatically, the Rail Users' Consultative Committee disclosed
yesterday.
Almost 15% of trains failed to arrive on time on the main commuter
networks around Glasgow and Edinburgh. The charter stipulates that nine
out of 10 trains should arrive within five minutes of their scheduled
time.
ScotRail blamed last summer's signal workers' dispute for the poor
figures, major signalling problems at Haymarket, and the flooding which
hit Strathclyde late last year.
Privately, however, senior ScotRail figures were pointing the finger
at a lack of investment in Railtrack, the company which operates the
lines. Railtrack for its part conceded major infrastructure problems
but, said a spokesman, no amount of money could have avoided them, and
the situation had now improved.
Mr Henry McLeish MP, Labour's rail spokesman, said privatisation
reorganisation, which came in last year, was not working and the
Government must abandon the ''crazy notion''.
''We are alarmed by the failure of Railtrack to get to grips with the
lack of investment and the difficulties facing the rail network. It is
quite clear that far too much emphasis is being placed on the flotation
in April or May of next year, and too little is being paid to the real
problems of servicing the rail operators, which become ScotRail's
problems in delivering services.''
Mr Lawrence Kemp, acting chairman of the RUCC, said infrastructure
problems had played a major part in ScotRail's poor performance.
''It has been a really bad year for ScotRail,'' he said. ''It's the
first time in the history of the passenger charter that it has had to
pay out refunds.
''The whole concept of infrastructure maintenance is worrying the
committee.''
The RUCC is currently compiling complaints figures from the public for
the past year. They show that, to December, the organisation received
324 complaints compared to 284 for the whole of the previous year. A
spokesman at the committee's Glasgow offices said the final figures were
expected to be around 360.
''These are generally only complaints from people who have already
been to BR and feel they have not got satisfaction. Many of the
complaints this year are about punctuality.''
Performance indicators on punctuality and reliability are prepared by
ScotRail and posted on station walls. Punctuality was 85.2% for the East
line and 86.2% for the Central line.
Last year, the company comfortably exceeded the 90% target on all
lines. ScotRail did score highly on reliability figures, with an average
of 99.4% of trains running.
A spokesman for ScotRail said yesterday it was unable to say how many
passengers had been given discounts of 5% for the charter breach. He
conceded the number would be in the thousands.
An official of Railtrack said that figures for the last four weeks of
the year showed that performance had recovered. He added that
infrastructure problems had badly hit services for much of last year.
