THE Scottish Office said yesterday that it was confident all 7000
former patients of a dentist found to be carrying the hepatitis B virus
would be contacted this week.
A spokeswoman at the Scottish Office, which is dealing with press
inquiries on behalf of the co-ordinators of the advice service, the
National Centre for Infectious Diseases at Ruchill Hospital in Glasgow,
said the number of a telephone helpline would be included in the letters
being sent to patients.
The helpline number, however, would not be made available to the
general public because it was regarded as being ''irrelevant'' for
anyone not treated by the man.
Health officials, who will offer blood tests to those still worried
after receiving advice, have stressed that they believe the risk of any
former patients being infected is minimal.
Highland Health Board, in whose area the unidentified dentist first
worked after graduating, said only a handful of concerned people had
contacted them.
The Scottish Office was unable to say how many people had called the
health boards in the other areas the dentist worked -- Forth Valley,
Lanarkshire, and Greater Glasgow -- in advance of the letters being
sent, but said ''very balanced and sensible'' reporting of the matter
had prevented any unnecessary public alarm.
The dentist, who has since stopped working, was a community-based
practitioner in the Highlands between 1986 and 1988 and treated between
1500 and 2000 people there before moving south.
A board spokesman said yesterday: ''We have had two or three calls
from people concerned about the situation and we have been able to allay
their fears.''
Hepatitis B is transmitted through body fluids and, although about 95%
of sufferers recover, it is potentially fatal.

IN The Herald last week, Mark Fisher was driven to suggest that there
is a ''gulf of misunderstanding between audiences and reviewers'' and
finding himself at odds with the bulk of the audience attending the
Billy Connolly play at the Pavilion.
Had someone forgotten to let him in on the joke, he mused, or was it
in fact the case that ''popular theatre'' audiences lacked
discrimination and are unable to spot a bad play when it hit them in the
proscenium arch? If this is true, does it mean that audiences for other
forms of theatre are by nature astute and discerning, and in any case
does anyone really know how to distinguish between popular theatre and
non-popular theatre?
As set designer for Clyde Unity Theatre, I am in the envied position
(among members of the company, you understand) that I don't have to be
at every single performance of their current production, Breadmakers.
Rather, I have been the company's link with the world of Mayfest, and
have been able to report back on a host of theatre productions they
haven't had the chance to see.
These have included productions of Easy, Born Guilty and Persons
Unknown at the Citizens' Theatre, Needles and Opium at the Kings and The
Crucible, Asylum, Asylum and Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens
at The Arches. Been there, done that, seen the reviews.
And what of the reviews? The ladies and gentleman of the press have
been known to get it terribly, terribly wrong (ie when I don't agree
with them). But it has to be said that over the past few weeks newspaper
crits for the above-mentioned shows would appear to reflect the
reactions of audiences at performances I've attended.
But these examples are all taken from subsidised, or ''not always
quite so popular theatre'' and fall into a different category from
Borderline Billy Connolly plays.
Why? Is it simply that the audience loved it and the press didn't,
therefore it must be popular theatre? Or is it the transforming effect
of the venue -- Borderline is a subsidised theatre company working in
this case with the commercial management of the Pavilion -- which can
create instant popularity, regardless of how many turn up on the night.
When I hear the term ''popular theatre'' I usually presume it refers
to productions which can fill the Pavilion or King's (no other theatre
need apply), has everyone speaking in Glesga accent, except for toffs
who can be English, and includes at least one cast member from Rab C
Nesbit or, failing that, someone from City Lights.
My definition adds that such drama rarely exists outside Glasgow, and
I might also jump to the conclusion that the audience for this show
would not be likely be spotted in the Citizens' Studio watching Robert
David Macdonald's Persons Unknown. This is not to put any value judgment
on people's taste in theatre, but to acknowledge that different shows
attract different audiences, and to label some shows as ''popular
theatre'' tells us very little about the people who go to see them.
Over the years I have worked on a range of shows with Clyde Unity
Theatre, touring with them to tiny wee community halls and established
theatre venues. It is very clear that as the venue changes, so does the
audience. A Little Older, for example, played to an international
audience of academics, artists, tourists and regular theatre-goers at
the Fringe in 1992 before transfering to Hampstead to play to an
audience consisting largely of ladies from the local Jewish community.
Since then, this very Scottish play has toured Glasgow community
centres and been performed in Germany, Singapore and the US. Similarly,
the Breadmakers tour runs the gamut from the luxurious main theatre at
the Citizens' to the friendly, squashy Springburn Elderly and Disabled
Centre, and each venue brings in a different crowd.
Some are local, others have travelled a fair distance. Some are Clyde
Unity regulars, many are fans of Margaret Thomson Davis's source novel,
others are attracted by the revues, the Glaswegian story or the
company's reputation. Whatever brings them in, they then respond to the
production in different ways, finding humour in different scenes,
recognising local references and songs and identifying with the
characters.
Some do see aspects of their own lives reflected on the stage. The
central character in Breadmakers, Catriona, marries in haste to escape
her overbearing Ma, only to repent at leisure. When she later
miscarries, there is an audible wave of sympathy towards her, more
pronounced in some venues than others.
In short, there is much more, and sometimes significantly less, to
good theatre than a good script. If the script was always first-class,
our theatre would be the richer for it. If it is poor it is a wasted
opportunity, and the production's potential is stifled before it gets to
see a spotlight. None the less, the audience can still find other
avenues for their enjoyment, not least of which is the experience of
being in a packed theatre surrounded by others determined to have a good
night out.
It is to be lamented that Billy Connolly's plays are currently the
standard bearers for Scottish popular theatre.
It is perhaps more important, however, to question the classification
of theatre performances which makes genuinely popular and well-scripted
theatre produced by subsidised companies, such as Clyde Unity Theatre's
Breadmakers, TAG's Sunset Song and the Citizens' Swing Hammer Swing
ineligible for the title.

WORKERS at a Highland oil fabrication yard voted yesterday to continue
their unoffical industrial action over a redundancy dispute after talks
ended without agreement.
The discussions were held between management and unions at the yard at
Nigg, Easter Ross, in an effort to resolve the situation.
However the 700 men decided to continue their action while a legal
challenge to a redundancy scheme is clarified.
Mr Steve Aburrow, the yard's union shop steward, said he hoped the
legal position would be made clear today and a further meeting of the
men is planned for tomorrow at the yard.
A management spokeswoman declined to comment.
The workers downed tools last Tuesday in support of 80 colleagues who
they claimed had been unfairly treated over redundancy.
The 80 men transferred from Nigg to a sister yard at Ardersier with
which it merged in January. However, it is claimed that the management
are not considering the Nigg staff's length of service when offering
them redundancy.
Last week Mr Paul McKay, a Nigg welder, was awarded an interim
interdict at the Court of Session preventing the yard from making him
and his workmates redundant.
The merged yard, known as Barmac, has not moved to recall the
interdict so far.

<HEADLINE>Heart and soul from Celtic manager. Pride still Burns within Parkhead</HEADLINE>

THE behind-the-scenes battles which have scarred Celtic throughout the
past season were eventually aired yesterday by manager Tommy Burns in
one of the frankest press conferences in memory.
Burns sat at Parkhead with the Scottish Cup in front of him, and
bottles of the new club champagne littered across the boardroom table,
and then talked about what seems to have become a battle for the heart
and soul of this great club.
There were different sightings of Burns at Celtic Park yesterday --
the manager enjoying himself with a former manager Billy McNeill and a
one-time playing pal, Dixie Deans, as they launched Celtic's own brand
bubbly.
But there was no sign of the club's managing director Fergus McCann on
a day when differences between himself and his manager should have been
resolved.
Burns shirked no issues as he faced the press. Instead, the Celtic
manager admitted to the disagreements which have clouded the
celebrations he deserves to enjoy after the Scottish Cup final victory
over Airdrie.
He talked of policy problems, about a lack of trust between himself
and his employers, and about his players being treated as second-class
citizens by the club. As he left the ground he told fans who were
waiting anxiously to find out if he would quit the club: ''I would have
to be driven out of that front door.''
The rift between Burns and McCann had not been healed yesterday,
though Burns declared that he hoped some kind of agreement could be
reached this week.
There is little doubt that the only way matters can be resolved is if
Burns can feel comfortable in his relationship with McCann.
The manager should be enjoying the fruits of his labours after having
ended the trophy famine which had afflicted the club. Instead, he finds
himself still facing problems which should have been resolved much
earlier in his reign as team manager.
''I don't want to walk away from this job and allow someone to take
over who would not let the supporters know the truth about what was
happening here. That would be wrong. I will never hide things from the
Celtic support. It would not be right to do that,'' he said.
''What I need to have here is trust from the people who employ me. I
have to know that they will trust my judgment about the valuation of
players and the kind of contracts that players we are interested in
should be given.
''When I was appointed I was given certain areas of responsibility and
now I find these have been diluted and I don't want that to happen.
''But I don't want to leave and find someone else coming in to pay lip
service because that is not my way. I could never do that. If people
don't like what I am then that is their problem. I am not going to
become someone else.
''I am here to look after the football side of this club and I want to
see the players treated properly.
''The players are the most important people at any club and that has
to be recognised. When I was a player with Celtic that was always the
way it was and it is the way it should be. There can be no other way.''
Now, a meeting between Burns and McCann has to be arranged to steer
the club clear of crisis at a time when there should be joy
unconstrained.
Meanwhile, John Collins was warned by Burns: ''Middlesbrough are not a
bigger club than Celtic.''
The newly-promoted English side have made it clear that they would
like to have Collins in the team they take into the Premiership next
season.
To do so they are ready to offer Celtic #2m for the player who joined
them from Hibs for half that amount five years ago.
On Saturday, Collins won his first medal in the Scottish Cup final and
was immediately linked with a transfer south.
As well as Middlesbrough, managed by former Manchester United player
Bryan Robson, Everton have been made aware of the fact that Collins
could be available.
But Burns said yesterday: ''Players sometimes don't think the same way
as managers, but I would have to say to John that Middlesbrough are not
as big a club as Celtic. I don't know why he would want to go there.
''As far as this club is concerned we would have to see more money
than has been suggested if we were to allow him to leave.''

BERNHARD Langer calmly and firmly holed a three-foot putt on the home
green at Wentworth yesterday to win the Volvo PGA championship for the
third time. He thereby extended to 17 the number of consecutive seasons
in Europe in which he has achieved at least one victory, a record he now
shares with Severiano Ballesteros.
On another difficult afternoon, when a cool and gusty wind bustled
through the tall trees lining the fairways of the hard and bouncy
6957-yard West course, the 37-year-old German had a final round of 71
for a total of 279.
The score was enough to earn him the #150,000 first prize by a stroke
from the talented 26-year-old New Zealander, Michael Campbell, whose 67
included only 22 putts, and the Swede Per-Ulrik Johansson, whose hopes
of catching Langer evaporated when three from the edge of the
seventeenth and a bunkered second at the last denied him necessary
birdie chances.
Langer has not long recovered from an operation on an ingrowing
fingernail on his right hand. Even now he still works on alterations to
his swing, principally for improved accuracy but also to take the strain
off his back, always liable to stiffen up.
Somehow that ailment was reflected in the way he played the last.
Langer knew a par would win. His drive drifted into rough, he carefully
struck one wedge shot 140 yards, and another from 66 yards to 15 feet.
He was dismayed to see his first putt take off as far past the hole as
it did and just as relieved to make the second.
Campbell's great-great-great-great grandfather Logan Campbell,
emigrated from Edinburgh in the 1860s, became Mayor of Auckland and was
knighted. He also took to himself three Maori wives simultaneously,
hence his descendant's obvious lineage.
Campbell took two talismans with him -- the same style of red socks as
was worn by New Zealand's victorious America's Cup yachting crew and his
new caddie Max Cunningham, a fellow member of the Manor Park club in
Wellington, who parted company with his long-time employee, Sandy Lyle,
after last month's Masters.
All the same, even these were inadequate indications of Campbell's
assault on par over the last four holes -- 2, 3, 4, 4 -- an eagle and
three birdies, whose 10-stroke total actually outscored by 13 strokes
the holder, Jose Maria Olazabal.
In his 71 for 283, Colin Montgomerie's five birdies were all very
well, but the loss of four strokes, through double bogey 6s at the third
and ninth, represented -- all other things having been the same -- the
number by which he finished behind Langer.
At least Montgomerie had five red figures on his card, five more than
Nick Faldo, for instance, could accomplish. Gary Orr's par 72 was more
typical of the scoring patterns on a day when only Costantino Rocca,
round in 69, avoided a bogey -- one double bogey, four bogeys, one eagle
and four birdies.
Lyle's 69 outscored his partner and fellow Scot Kevin Stables by six
strokes -- excluding as it did double bogeys and three putts.
The championship was among the last to offer an escape route into the
Open Championship at St Andrews in July and the leading five in the
first 20 on the merit table, not otherwise exempt, who gained places
were Peter O'Malley, Campbell, Jose Rivero, Robert Karlsson and, despite
having missed the cut, Scotland's Andrew Coltart. Leading scores:
279 -- B Langer (Germany) 67, 73, 68, 71 (#150,000).
280 -- M Campbell (New Zealand) 69, 73, 71, 67; P-U Johansson (Sweden)
71, 69, 69 (#78,165 each).
282 -- P O'Malley (Australia) 74, 71, 70, 67; P Senior (Australia) 66,
73, 73, 70; T Levet (France) 72, 68, 71, 71; J Parnevik (Sweden) 68, 73,
70, 71; A Sherborne 68, 69, 72, 73 (#32,828 each).
283 -- S Grappasonni (Italy) 72, 69, 71, 71; C Montgomerie 70, 72, 69,
72; M Mouland 72, 71, 65, 75.
284 -- M A Jimenez (Spain) 73, 69, 71, 71; R Boxall 72, 71, 70, 71; G
Orr 70, 67, 75, 72; J M Canizares (Spain) 69, 70, 71, 74; N Faldo 67,
72, 71, 74.
Other scores included: 285 -- S Lyle 74, 71, 71, 69. 286 -- A Oldcorn
70, 73, 73, 70; J M Olazabal (Spain) 69, 72, 72, 73. 287 -- G Brand Jr
73, 69, 71, 74. 288 -- C Rocca (Italy) 72, 70, 77, 69; S Ballesteros
(Spain) 72, 73, 69, 74; F Nobilo (New Zealand) 68, 68, 77, 75. 291 -- K
Stables 74, 71, 71, 75.

THE only certainty about Europe and Scotland next season is that
Partick Thistle will be the first team to represent the country in
foreign competition when they take on teams from France, Austria,
Iceland and Croatia in the Intertoto Cup, writes Ian Paul.
Thistle do not know for sure who they will meet in Group Six of this
intermediary contest which will result in four extra UEFA Cup places for
the lucky -- and probably exhausted qualifiers.
However, the club has been told one name, that of Keflavik of Iceland,
who will be their opponents at Firhill on July 1. The chances are that
the others will be Metz (in France on July 8), FC Tirol (in Austria on
June 24), and Zagreb of Croatia, possibly at Firhill on July 22, all yet
to be confirmed. The deadline is tomorrow.
''At the moment Metz, Tirol, Zagreb and Keflovik are the rated teams
in their championships.There is also a problem in Croatia with the
war.''

BRUCE Rioch's Bolton Wanderers returned to the top division of English
football after 15 years yesterday by winning a play-off final against
Reading 4-3 after extra time, writes Steve Tongue.
They were two down in 11 minutes to goals from Lee Nogan and Adrian
Williams, and Reading's Stuart Lovell also had missed a penalty. Step in
the Scottish connection, with John McGinlay, Mixu Paatelainen and Owen
Coyle all prominent in the goals which took the game to extra time --
Coyle heading in a McGinlay cross, and then Dutchman Fabian De Freitas
equalising.
In extra time Coyle and McGinlay set up former Aberdeen striker
Paatelainen for the third, and he later crossed for half-time substitute
De Freitas to stab in a fourth. Reading's player-manager Jimmy Quinn hit
his side's third.

ROY Aitken will have cash to spend to make Aberdeen a power in
Scotland next season, with Pittodrie chairman Ian Donald yesterday
promising that all the money from their forthcoming share launch would
be spent on rebuilding the team, writes Ian Broadley.
Around #3m will be raised by going public, and Donald said: ''Our
plans had to be put on hold until the relegation issue was settled. We
are now working hard on the scheme which is vitally important to the
club. All the money generated will go to the manager to spend as he sees
fit.''
But he then added: ''Cash is not plentiful and we have to be very
careful as we are trying to get the club back on an even keel. I think
we showed in the late part of the season that we have the nucleus of a
very good team. We do not need an awful lot to improve it. However, I
would imagine Roy will want to bring in at least a couple of players.
Much, though, will depend on the players who are going, and who are
staying.''

TOMMY Burns is backing Fergus McCann into a corner. The manager is
attempting a dangerous manoeuvre, but McCann would be on even more
hazardous ground if he responds in the manner the football world has
come to expect.
Burns may never be in a more powerful position having delivered to the
Celtic fans their first cup in six years . . .and he knows it.
Certain assurances concerning his right to manage are being sought and
if they are not given the supporters may turn on McCann, who has never
quite come to terms with the nuances and peculiar ways of the football
business.
This time he should listen to others and be absolutely certain that in
Burns he would be tackling a genuine people's champion.
Burns surveyed the Hampden slopes on Saturday as his players displayed
the cup and he saw people like himself. He saw Celtic fans with tears in
their eyes.
If McCann had cast a glance at Burns he would have noticed one of
football's most honest disciples. Integrity is rare in football but it
is a large part of the Burns philosophy and if he feels others should be
made aware of the difficulties manufactured from within then we should
accept he speaks for the good of the club and the supporters.
Burns has always known Celtic are more important than individuals and
he feels Celtic could be on the verge of a new beginning, but only if
everyone pulls in the same direction.
The managing director's intransigence has alienated him, and to a
degree his club, from the football community and he would be foolish to
test fans' loyalty. If ever there was a need to try a different approach
it is now.
He should accept true strength lies in an ability to adapt, a
willingness to listen and compromise and he should know also that
Celtic's supporters want trophies more than anything else. In that
respect Burns is the only person so far who has delivered.
If you do not bend you can be broken and for proof we need look no
further than the most formidable leader to emerge in the post-war years.
Margaret Thatcher was not for turning and look what happened to her.

SCOT John Cleland (Vauxhall Cavalier) added to his points tally when
he took second and third places in rounds nine and 10 respectively of
the British Touring Car Championship at Oulton Park, Cheshire,
yesterday.
The first race had to be stopped at the end of lap one after an
accident involving former grand prix driver Derek Warwick, who spun off
the circuit in his Alfa Romeo and hit a barrier. He was knocked
unconscious and was taken removed to hospital for a precautionary
check-up, but suffered nothing worse than bruising.
At the restart, Sweden's Rickard Rydell led the in his Volvo followed
by Cleland and Alain Menu's Renault, the trio quickly pulling away from
the rest of the field.
Cleland initially had his hands full fending off Menu but as the
Renault's handling worsened the Scot was able to close on Rydell,
finishing the 13-lap race half-a-second behind the Volvo, with Menu a
further one-and-a-half seconds adrift.
In the second race, the same three drivers finished on the podium but
in a different order. Menu broke led from start to finish, beating
Rydell by almost two seconds, with Cleland third.

TENNIS: FRENCH OPEN
ANDRE Agassi won back the hearts of the French crowd by sweeping past
German Karsetn Braasch in the first round of the French Open yesterday
in Paris.
The world No.1, widely criticised for letting unknown Frenchman
Thierry Guardiola win an exhibition match on Sunday, gave a far more
serious display on the centre court to win 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 in just more
than 90 minutes.
Fellow American Jim Courier, French Open champion in 1991 and 1992,
cruised into the second round in straight sets, beating compatriot Jeff
Tarango 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.
South African Wayne Ferreira, seeded eighth, and Russian Yevgeny
Kafelnikov also made it easily to the next round.
But Britain's Jeremy Bates was a first-round casualty gonig down 3-6,
0-6, 6-0, 5-7 to Frenchman Guillaume Raoux.
Steffi Graf, despite being out of action for six weeks, showed no
rustiness in beating Argentina's Ines Gorrochategui -- who reached the
last eight in Paris last year -- 6-1, 7-5 in barely an hour.

BASKETBALL
THE ''reward'' for the men's team failing to win a match in their
European Championship qualifying tournament which finished in Lugano
last Sunday, could be a trip to San Marino next July.
The bottom two teams in the Swiss tournament, Scotland and Austria,
qualify for the so-called Promotions Cup, formerly the Small Nations
Cup, and would join, among others, Wales and Luxembourg, the bottom two
from last week's tournament in Birmingham, and the minnows like
Gibraltar and, of course, San Marino.
But much will depend on where this event will rate in the new
development plan which will be put to the Scottish annual meeting in
September.
But the international governing body FIBA gives financial assistance
to the so-called developing countries and, ironically, Scotland would
now be eligible.

BANK Holiday Monday for each Rover Series is traditionally
make-or-break day as it offers two simple windward-leeward races,
counting equally in the final results for the 278 boats racing in 10
classes on Loch Fyne.
Only two crews remain unbeaten. In the Sonata Class, Steve Goacher won
comfortably in the first race in Eric The Boat, but then was pushed hard
by his Lake District rival David Clark in Saraband in the later race,
but maintained a 33-second advantage to the finish line. John Highcock's
crew of the Class 5 Moody 336 Crusader produced the phoenix act of the
day to tally five firsts from five races.
Having won the first race easily, they were recalled from a premature
start in the second heat and had to recross the start line with a
deficit, according to helm Highcock, of at least four minutes. They
overturned this to win by just 32 seconds to keep them running head to
head with Goacher for the overall Rover Series Trophy. Results:

THE Scottish athletics pilgrims who progressed to Bedford met with
Giant Despair yesterday. After their seven-medal feast on the opening
day of the UK Inter-Counties championships came near famine in the home
town of John Bunyan.
Although they battled into many finals, only Mel Neef, winner of the
200m, claimed a further medal -- denied a title double by just one
hundredth of a second. But the City of Glasgow woman timed 11.70sec, her
fastest legal 100m, behind Clova Court, the international heptathlete.
Neef leap-frogged Dawn Flockhart and Angela Bridgeman into ninth place
on the Scottish all-time list -- a boost before her first international
400m of the year, in Nuremberg next month.
John McFadyen, from Dunoon, took fourth in the 800m, but both he and
Andy Young ran faster in the heats. That fate also befell Lorna Silver
and Barry Middleton in the 400m hurdles -- Aberdeen's Middleton was
disqualified in the final for pushing over a barrier.
World junior medallist Ian Mackie found a three week lay-off, nursing
a hamstring injury, too much and could finish only fourth in the 200m.
Ross Baillie opted out because of a bruised foot.
A similar injury struck Fiona Watt in the triple jump. She aggravated
the problem on Sunday, and withdrew from yesterday's long jump. Alison
Curbishley reached the 400m final, but withdrew, feeling ill.
Verity Snook, the Commonwealth walker, achieved a time which would
have been a Scottish record - but there were insufficent qualified
judges. Winners and Scottish placings:

AYRSHIRE and Inverclyde's most prestigious hotel is cooking up a
double celebration. For it is precisely five years since the Brisbane
House Hotel in Largs was bought over by Jannick Bertschy and George
Maltby, and the family-run establishment -- the two directors are
brothers-in-law -- has just appointed an award-winning Scottish chef.
The chef -- a Salon Culinaire D'Ecosse gold medallist, former sous
chef at the Rogano, Glasgow, and latterly head chef at Vitelli and
Vitelli in Glasgow's Italian Centre -- is sure to enhance the hotel's
already excellent reputation for good food, comfortable accommodation,
and high standards of service. A reputation underlined by the Scottish
Tourist Board ''Four Crowns, Highly Commended'', and the three stars of
the RAC and AA, which has also awarded a rosette for excellence in
cuisine.
The hotel makes extensive use of local produce and its professional
chefs demonstrate a flair in European cuisine. ''We are world renowned
for our international restaurant style,'' said director Jannick
Bertschy, who was trained in Switzerland as a chef. ''The Brisbane chefs
can cater for the most discerning of diners, who can choose from our
carefully selected wines from around the world.''
All of the Georgian-style Brisbane House Hotel's 23 bedrooms have
en-suite facilities with a unique individuality. Many offer picturesque
views over the Firth. Stylish executive and traditional honeymoon suites
are also available.
Over the past five years the Brisbane House, which is just 30 minutes
from Glasgow Airport, has become extremely popular as a conference
venue. With its marvellous location -- it features majestic views over
the Firth of Clyde to the Isle of Arran and the Cumbraes, and north to
the romantic Kyles of Bute -- it features as a first choice for
weddings.
The elegant hotel, which features a splendid Italian-style marble
foyer and reception area, recently added a stylish conservatory
overlooking the Firth and there are plans to cater for larger summer
wedding parties by providing a marquee in the attractively landscaped
grounds.
''We cater for a lot of weddings over summer. We organise wedding
fairs, in February and November, which have been very successful. Apart
from bringing in new bookings, the fairs give couples who have booked a
chance to see the service we provide,'' said George Maltby who has
international hotel training.
The Brisbane House facilities comprise three stylishly appointed rooms
accommodating up to 100 delegates. The more intimate Glen Room provides
the perfect atmosphere and can accommodate up to 40 delegates with
comfort.
''A lot of our business comes from the bigger companies in Greenock
and Glasgow, and you will find Japanese, French, Italian, and Americans
purely because of the international nature of the businesses in the
area.
As part of the hotel's entertainment drive, jazz guitarist Nigel Clark
who used to play for the band Hue and Cry will be performing on most
Sunday afternoons between 3pm and 6pm and it is also hoped that over the
summer months the hotel will be arranging other attractions.
''The hotel restaurant, cocktail bar, and conservatory provide three
very different types of atmosphere, different decor and different food,
but the conservatory has proved extremely popular, especially in the
lovely summer evenings, with some people preferring to eat there than in
the restaurant.'' George added.

A TEAM of five students from Oatridge Agricultural College, West
Lothian, has won the 1995 Trident Feeds Enterprising Student Award --
the first time it has come north of the Border.
The winning project from Oatridge investigated the finishing of
Scottish Blackface store lambs on Grainbeet -- a cost-effective
alternative feed combining distiller's grains with Trident molassed
sugar beet feed.
David Turner, head of agriculture at Oatridge, said that the aim of
the project had been to produce a low-cost quality feed which contained
all the necessary energy and protein levels.
''Essentially we were using two by-products,'' he said. ''These were
mixed together at the rate of 180 kilos of molassed sugar beet to one
ton of distiller's grains. It was then ensiled and sealed.''
The feed was given ad lib to the store lambs and was proved to give a
performance, in terms of growth and weight gain, which was better than
many other finishing systems.
''The longer you feed a lamb -- and the cheaper the feed -- the more
margin there is available, so we were looking for a feed which would
sustain the long-keep lambs at low cost,'' said Mr Turner.
The judges found that the Oatridge team gave a very confident oral
presentation and an excellent poster display. ''This was a good example
of a straightforward, practical trial with commercial applications, well
organised and showing a satisfactory depth of knowledge,'' they said.
The winning students at Oatridge received a #500 cheque for the
college and an engraved silver sugar caster.
Pictured receiving the cheque are (left to right) students Andrew
Barton, Alastair Reid, Alan Smith and Alan Kennedy with Professor David
Armstrong from Newcastle, one of the judges. The fifth member of the
Oatridge team, Peter Hastie, was unable to attend the final.

AN extra 15 acres of grass have been added to the 100 acres originally
set aside for the two-day ScotGrass '95 event to be held at Woodend
Farm, Armadale next month.
The additional allocation follows a high demand from machinery
suppliers for plots at the event which is expected to be the biggest
working demonstration of its kind ever held in Scotland.
Grassland machinery from most of the UK's leading manufacturers and
suppliers will be put through its paces including mowers, conditioners,
tedders, rakes, forage harvesters, balers and bale wrappers.
Host farmer Roy McNee said that the arrival of warmer, more seasonal
weather, was now boosting grass growth significantly after a series of
late frosts in April and early May. ''There will be plenty of grass to
harvest across the site,'' he promised.

There is no point in money going to the shareholders, it is the team
that requires investment and if my offer is accepted that is where the
cash will go.
JIM GLASS
THE beleaguered Hearts board will this morning consider an offer of
#4m for new players in exchange for relinquishing control at the club.
Edinburgh property millionaire Jim Glass will speak to major
shareholders Chris Robinson and Leslie Deans in the next 48 hours, to
seek their response.
Glass has witnessed the rapid decline in Hearts position throughout
the new regime's first season, from his place as a regular attender in
the Tynecastle stand.
And his offer, which involves an immediate #2m to be quickly followed
by a similar sum, will be very difficult to reject.
This most recent development may be the final scene in a production
which has portrayed a disastrous flirtation with football for catering
chief Robinson and lawyer Deans.
They purchased just more than 50% of Wallace Mercer's shareholding in
Hearts a year ago, pledging to lend their business expertise to a club
Mercer had nurtured for 12 years.
The reality was that their much-publicised share issue, which was to
have produced the funds that would transform the club's finances, was a
crippling flop.
From the day last autumn that the net proceeds realised around
#300,000 the grand plan was flawed, without the support of the Hearts
rank and file.
But there have been other factors at work, which have sapped the club
of their traditional togetherness and introduced jeopardy rather than
prosperity.
Robinson and Deans started their period in charge as equal partners
but the reality has been a quiet back seat for Deans, the high profile
chairmanship from Robinson.
The fact that Deans has had recent meetings with both Glass and Mercer
indicate an unhappiness that has contributed to the destabilising of the
current Hearts board.
Glass has recently visited Mercer in the South of France, so it can be
assumed that the former chairman's voting rights, from the near 25% of
the shares he retained, will fall on the Glass side.
Mercer, too, cannot be happy with the treatment he has received from
the current incumbants, despite the fact that he has a #1m bank
guarantee shoring up the existing board.
On a recent visit to a Hearts home match both he and his wife, Anne,
were ignored by Robinson in the boardroom for the entire afternoon.
Glass, who is a close personal friend and business associate of
Newcastle chairman Sir John Hall, stressed last night that his offer
will benefit the team and not the shareholders.
''There is no point in money going to the shareholders, it is the team
that requires investment and if my offer is accepted that is where the
cash will go,'' he insisted.
''I have spoken to Mr Mercer and he has no intention of becoming
involved again but as a major shareholder he is obviously interested in
the future of the club.''
Despite selling Alan McLaren and Tosh McKinlay, Hearts still have
borrowings of around #4m and they escaped the trauma of the play-off
match on the final day of the season.
They need to find close on #1m for the construction of the stand at
the School end at Tynecastle which may stretch resources to breaking
point.
This new offer from a man of impeccable business standing, signals the
way ahead for a club which has had its fundamental fabric shredded
during the last year.
Robinson and Deans arrived at the Tynecastle front door 12 months ago,
full of good intentions. Since then, they have discovered that following
The Great Waldo it is a difficult trick. Glass is the man for that job.

<HEADLINE>South-west landowners seek meeting with Scottish Natural Heritage. Concern over habitats directive</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the Scottish Landowners' Federation in south-west Scotland
have expressed concern at the extent to which restrictions on
countryside activities could impinge on areas adjacent to those likely
to be designated as requiring special protection under the new European
Habitats Directive.
The federation's south-west regional committee has pointed to the
designation of the Upper Solway as a Site of Special Scientific Interest
as an example where activities in an entire catchment area could be
affected.
The committee is seeking further discussion with Scottish Natural
Heritage in an attempt to establish the actual proposed extent of land
-- including land adjoining conservation areas -- which will be affected
by designations under the new directive.
The new habitats directive lists 63 species of plant and animals found
in Scotland and regarded as important in EC terms because they are
''rare, endangered or vulnerable''. There are also 52 habitats,
including 14 ''priority'' habitats.
A draft list of sites being considered as Special Areas of
Conservation will be submitted to Brussels next week but the SNH has
emphasised that no final decisions will be made until the views of the
owners and occupiers of land have been considered.
The European Commission and member states expect to reach agreement by
June 1998 on the areas to be designated as SACs. Formal designation by
the Secretary of State for Scotland will follow soon after that.
The new directive will introduce more stringent controls than existing
SSSI arrangements. At present SSSIs have a specified list of activities
which are considered damaging to the special interests of the area.
Owners and occupiers already require consent from Scottish Natural
Heritage before any of these activities can take place. Some of these
existing consents may be withdrawn.
The Secretary of State for Scotland will have powers to implement
Nature Conservation orders to protect SSSIs if negotiations to prevent
potentially damaging operations fail. Scottish Natural Heritage will
also have the power to make bye-laws for sites and for adjacent land.
Those would be tailored to local circumstances and could include
restrictions on access, prevention of disturbance to flora and fauna and
prohibitions on lighting fires and on dumping.
The new arrangements are being introduced under a global heading
Natura 2000 which is being adopted as the title for a network of areas
designed to conserve rare plants and species in the European Community.
The title is intended to symbolise the conservation of precious natural
resources for the year 2000 and beyond.
The Natura 2000 network will include two types of area. Special Areas
of Conservation (SAC) will support rare, endangered or vulnerable
natural habitats and species of plants or animals. Special Protection
Areas (SPAs) will refer particularly to areas which support significant
numbers of wild birds and their habitats.
Some areas may become both SAPs and SPAs but all sites potentially
earmarked under either heading would first require to be notified as
Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Natural 2000 status will
supplement and not replace SSSI designation.

JACK Berry set his sights on Lochsong's sprint crown after saddling
Mind Games to complete a hat trick by capturing the Tripleprint Temple
Stakes at Sandown yesterday.
He believes the sprint championship can at last be claimed for
Cockerham after his latest speedster romped to an emphatic success in
the Group 2 event.
Mind Games quickened from the front to sweep clear of Millstream and
win easing down for John Carroll by three lengths with Owington
disappointing again two-and-a-half lengths back in third.
With the abdication of the queen of speed at the end of last season,
Berry feels Mind Games can be crowned king with Royal Ascot the next
stop.
''The sprint division is exceptionally open this year and Mind Games
is an improving horse,'' said Berry. ''He can certainly trap. He didn't
half quicken off a fast pace and he did it in a stride. He's a real
professional. He can race from the front or back on firm or soft
ground.''

South Africa,
SCOTLAND have an ace up their sleeves for the crucial World Cup
encounter with Tonga in the Loftus Versfeld stadium in Pretoria tonight.
Assistant coach Richie Dixon was, for a short time, a member of the
Tongan back-room staff and supplied the South Sea islanders with a
training manual when he paid a coaching visit to the islands two years
ago.
Dixon was invited, through the Scottish and Tongan rugby unions, to
coach the Tongan international squad and impart his rugby knowledge to
clubs and schools after Scotland's South Sea Islands tour in 1993.
He spent three weeks on the islands and half-a-dozen of the players
who came under his tuition will play for Tonga against Scotland.
''We knew then that if they qualified for the World Cup then they
would be in our pool but my visit was arranged, nevertheless, as part of
the SRU's brief to help out other unions.
''I found them to be very willing learners and they were very keen to
put into practice the drills and disciplines that I was demonstrating to
them.
''They were particularly interested in set-piece play. Really, what I
was trying to do was to instil discipline without disturbing the rhythm
and athleticism which forms a major part of their natural game.
''The raw material that I had to work with was pretty sound,'' he
declared.
Scotland field what is virtually a full-strength side against the
Tongans, and a win tonight would ensure passage into the quarter-finals.
Similarly, with a defeat at the hands of France behind them, Tonga
will view the game as their last chance of survival. The Tongans are
also likely to be affected by the fact that, in that game against
France, loose-forward Feleti Mahoni was sent off for stamping and has
since received a six-week ban and a one-way ticket home.
Dixon said: ''Having spent some time there I know how the Tongans will
be thinking and that because of the sending-off, to some extent, the
party will be in disgrace and will be doing all that they can to redeem
themselves.
''This isn't going to be an easy game for us because, to a large
extent, the Tongan eggs are all in one basket. They have to beat us if
they are going to go any further.
''We shouldn't really have any qualms about them but it's a cup-tie
situation and things can change very quickly. We will have to play in
such a way that we leave no room for doubt about our going through to
the quarter-finals. We can't treat them lightly,'' he said.
Scotland have played Tonga twice before, winning 44-8 at Murrayfield
in 1974 and posting a 23-5 victory during the South Seas tour in 1993.
Three members of the current party, Kenny Logan, Doddie Weir, and the
coach, Dougie Morgan, have all scored tries against the Tongans,
although of different vintage, the coach's touchdown dating back to that
game in 1974.
Morgan said yesterday: ''We're not even thinking about the game
against France on Saturday. We are totally focused on the Tongans. If we
win we are into the quarter-finals. We have not even spoken about France
yet, and, in the same way, we didn't talk about the Tongans until the
Ivory Coast game was out of the way.''
Morgan said that, unlike the Ivoriennes, who were very much an unknown
quantity, the Scots knew quite a bit about Tonga.
''Obviously, we have seen them against France but we have also studied
video recordings of their performances in the Super Ten championship.''
The Scotland captain, Gavin Hastings, is nursing a slight groin strain
and took no part in training yesterday. However, he expects to be fully
fit to lead the Scots under the lights at the Loftus Versfeld stadium at
which the Scottish side made an acclimatisation visit last night.
''Tonga realise that if they don't win then they are out of the World
Cup. Therefore, we don't expect anything other than a very hard match
and they will play even harder than they did against France,'' he said.

THIS week's list of companies reporting interim and full-year results
includes several well-known Scottish names as well as other leading
blue-chip companies.
Thursday sees half-year results from Stakis, the highly-rated hotels
and casinos group, should show what impact, if any, the Lottery has had
on the figures on the gambling side but it is not expected to be
significant.
An improving trading environment and good management action in both
hotels and casinos is expected to produce strong earnings growth in the
current year. After six months these could have almost doubled to #12m
before tax against #6.6m last time. A useful increase in the interim
dividend is also in prospect.
Probably the biggest company reporting is High Street retailer Boots
whose full-year figures are also expected on Thursday.
The Boots the Chemist division contributes around 84% of profits and
the company's overall performance revolves increasingly around this.
Some analysts reckon profits will have risen to up to #529m for the year
to the end of March compared with #484m in the previous year though this
is the top of a range from #520m to #529m.
A 10% dividend hike from 15p to 16.5p is also thought likely to be on
the cards.
Yet another Thursday unveiling comes from Durex and rubber gloves
specialist London International Group which in the previous year had
plunged into the red by #175m. Having sold off its photoprocessing
business and undertaken a major restructuring progranme, the picture is
now much brighter and a return to the black by around #14m is considered
likely.
Shareholders, who not surprisingly lost their dividend last time,
could receive 1p.
Completing a busy day on Thursday, engineering group Siebe is thought
to be on course for a rise from #217.2m to up to #275m before tax over
the 12 months period to end-March.
The increasingly strong order book seen in the control systems
division and several of the businesses within the diversified products
division should have ensured that Siebe finished the year strongly and
has made a good start to 1995-96.
Shareholders are expected to be rewarded with a dividend rise from 11p
to 12.25p.
Today, Babcock International presents its annual results following a
loss of #11.2m on the preceding year. Brokers Albert E Sharp are
projecting #12.5m before tax and a 0.50p dividend payout against nil for
1994.

South Africa,
FRANCOIS Peinaar's South African rugby team aims to take another
inexorable step toward the World Cup later today in this continent's
traditional home of rugby, Stellenbosch, just outside Cape Town. Romania
are their hapless opponents, and no matter how Kitch Christie might wish
to tell us otherwise, the home team, now the favourites in the
competition, should dispatch the Eastern Europeans with ease.
Getting his second run in a row on the right wing is one of South
Africa's great heroes, James Small, another of this side's ''self
employed''. Small is the loner in the team. Roy Laidlaw and I were the
only two people to see Sunday's South African session and yesterday's,
and we got a wee wave from the players when we watch them now. It was
time to speak to Mr Small.
For your information, James Small has his own calendar on sale to the
public where he can be seen in several scantily clad poses, has the body
of a muscle freak, and the kind of moodiness that Steve McQueen enjoyed
in abundance.
His fans, many female, love him. He cries during team talks, and
showed such restless commitment before the opening game when, during the
national anthems, he clutched at the motif on his jersey and rocked
backwards and forwards as if on the edge of a great cliff.
''It was the biggest day of my life. All of this, for us, is escapism
from the reality of our daily lives,'' he explains.
Small, you could say, wears his heart on his studs. He trains,
methodically, by himself at times, as if intent on killing his favourite
tackle bag. He stands it up, makes markings on the ground, maps the way
he thinks his defence will have to be on the big day with deft movements
of his hands, and then sets off in a wavy line that always leaves the
tackle bag well and truly dead. Dead and buried. Even when the bag has
been flattened he drives for more yards, dragging flat along the floor
like a crocodile.
''I like the physical stuff in rugby,'' he says ''Sometimes I'm not
doing as much as I think I should on the wing and I would like to be
getting stuck in with the forwards. Yeah, I like hitting into people.''
He looks across at Hennie Becker and Morne du Plessis, both former
Springboks who are training with them.
Becker is a very big man. ''But we have to work hard at our game. We
are not as big as our forefathers -- both Morne and Hennie are bigger
than any of our players in the squad -- which is why we do so much
weights. I am, after all, just a city kid.''
Some city kid. He was born in Cape Town, and now 26 years old he is
drilling opponents into the ground with alarming regularity for Natal
after having had a spell with Transvaal.
But a cloud has appeared on the horizon for Small in the shape of
devastating New Zealand winger Jonah Lomu. You sense that every time he
kills that tackle bag in practice he is thinking that Lomu might be
there in front of him later in the competition.
''I have stopped V'aiga Tuigamala before, so I should stop him,'' he
says, ''but he looks very good to me and it will be a challenge. He
might just have to cope with me.''
You have to suspect that there is truth in that comment, as of all the
teams that we have seen train in Cape Town the South Africans, Small
among them, do so with a kind of religious fervour that nobody else has,
not even the clinical Australians. There is a macho edge I have never
seen before.
The Romanians today will sample the kind of joys that only Small can
bring to rugby.

TONGAN flanker Feleti Mahoni, sent off during the Rugby World Cup
match against France last week, has gone home, leaving something of a
mystery behind him.
Tonga officials and team mates say that English referee Steve Lander
got the wrong man when he sent off Mahoni for stamping on French loose
forward Phillippe Benetton.
A disciplinary meeting later suspended Mahoni for six weeks,
preventing him taking any further part in the tournament. A team
spokesman said: ''The culprit, a lock, owned up during practice
yesterday.'' He refused to name the player.
* ROB Andrew takes over as England captain from the injured Will
Carling for the team's second tie, against Italy in Durban tomorrow
night.
* BLACKROCK College tight-head prop Paul Wallace is the only new cap
in Ireland's team to play Japan in Bloemfontein tomorrow.
* FRANCE will take the opportunity to experiment with their line-up
for their second pool D outing against the Ivory Coast in Rustenburg
today as they look to boost confidence before Saturday's match against
Scotland. Line-up:
France -- S Viars; P Saint-Andre (capt), F Mesnel, T Lacroix, W
Techoueyres; Y Delaigue, G Accoceberry; L Benezech, M de Rougemont, C
Califano, O Brouzet, O Roumat, A Costes, A Benazzi, L Cabannes.

THE convener of Central Regional Council, Anne Wallace, recently
opened Central Boulevard, the main artery leading into the authority's
prestigious new business park on the site of the former Royal Scottish
National Hospital at Larbert.
Ms Wallace also officially opened Block 4, a 30,000 sqft hi-tech light
manufacturing building with office space, parking for 80 cars, and a
prominent motorway frontage to the M876, which is now available to let.
The 47-acre site was purchased by Central Regional Council in 1991,
and all the buildings have been demolished with the exception of three.
Following the provision of the infrastructure and servicing facilities,
the regional council went on to construct units at the business park
which are aimed at inward investment market as well as indigenous
companies throughout Scotland.
Two speculative buildings were constructed and completed in November
1993, one of 42,600 sqft and one of 27,000 sqft. Through the marketing
efforts of the regional council, the smaller of the two was let to
Exabyte, an American company which manufactures mass media storage
systems and which had been previously located in Cumbernauld.
The Larbert site is now Exabyte's European headquarters. The company
recently acquired the adjacent 42,0000 sqft unit for expansion, and will
move into the new building at the end of July once the regional council
has completed its fitting out.
Each unit at Central Park is constructed on the basis of office space
to the front with the production area to the rear. They are capable of
being expanded either way, depending on individual need.
Following the success of Exabyte, moving into Central Park, the
regional council has constructed two further units in the park: the
newly opened Block 4 which is now complete, and Block 5 which is
currently under construction with completion planned for November, and
totalling 50,000 sqft.
Block 4, which benefits from a position of high visibility from the
M876, has generated considerable interest. ''A lot of our custom comes
from Locate in Scotland,'' explains Toby Withall, Central Regional
Council's inward investment marketing surveyor. ''They point people in
our direction, and we aim to marry up their requirements with the
buildings that we have available.''
The acquisition, preparation and development of Central Park
represents an investment of some #7m for Central Regional Council, and
has resulted in a particularly attractive, prestigious business park
which is well placed in communication terms for Central Scotland. The
main arterial road has as its focal point a fountain feature, and
extensive landscaping further softens the environment.
''It's right in the heart of Scotland,'' comments Toby Withall. ''The
motorway runs beside the park, at the moment it can be accessed to and
from the West but to get from Edinburgh to Central Park is more
circuitous.
''The hope is to construct two new slip roads from the motorway, to
and from the East. The site adjacent to Central Park is owned by Forth
Valley Enterprise, and it is hoped that along with them we can raise the
capital to construct those roads. We realise the importance of having
these links, so hopefully they'll go ahead in the long run.''
One of the listed buildings on the site has been earmarked as a common
user facility which will benefit all occupants of the business park. The
idea is that it will provide meeting rooms, a bistro, bar, and shop and
even some accommodation on the top floor. Exabyte has already expressed
interest in having such a facility available and the council
acknowledges the importance of meeting this need.
Over the next few years, it is intended to develop the whole park. The
master plan shows a development in excess of 400,000 sqft in variously
sized blocks ranging from 10,000 sqft up to 50,000 sqft.
''We are willing to look at all types of occupiers, including
distribution if the need arises,'' explains Mr Withall. ''Potential
occupiers come to us with requirements for building smaller than those
we've provided, so we are also able to build for them. We are dealing
with two such people at present, who require units of 10,000 to 15,000
sqft.
''More often than not,'' he explains, ''we need to adapt the
buildings, so, as another incentive, the regional council offers a
service of fitting out for the inward investor. What we try to offer is
a whole package.''
Graham Scott, the regional council's principal marketing surveyor,
believes that the fact that the buildings are ready constructed is a
major plus point. ''The original concept of the business park was to
construct the buildings themselves to Locate in Scotland specifications.
We took a deliberate decision to provide what are basically the highest
quality buildings of the time. The product is probably a lot better than
is available elsewhere.''

THE International Paper Company has fought back in the battle for
control of Switzerland by raising its SwFr435 per share offer for
Holvis, the Swiss non-woven textiles and paper distribution group to
SwFr550 or #257m, writes ANDREW WILSON.
The US paper company, which now controls 25% of the shares, added that
its offer is conditional on Holvis not going ahead with the agreement to
sell its Fiberweb non-woven textiles subsidiary to rival bidder
Britain's BBA Group.
BBA announced its SwFr500 bid for Holvis last Friday to value the
non-woven textiles and paper distribution business at #247m, including
some #13m of management options. Even if the bid fails, BBA has an
agreement to buy Holvis's Fiberweb subsidiary for #132m.
Holvis said its agreement over Fiberweb cannot be revoked.
It dismissed as ''cheap wisdom'' criticism that it had locked itself
into the BBA sale.
There had been some criticism that by Holvis agreeing to sell its key
Fiberweb to BBA, it effectively locked out International.
A prolonged legal battle could now begin as to whether the ''poison
pill'' is irrevocable.
The City liked the takeover move on Friday when BBA shares rose
17[1/2]p to 235[1/2]p.

Not all babies are born perfect, and coping with a joyous event that
goes wrong is hard work. Patrick Kingston tells one man's tale of worry
WATCHING the helicopter lift off, taking my wife and our two-day-old
son from the hospital helipad to I knew not where, was difficult. No
longer caught up in the frontline action, alone, and given the time to
ponder some depressing words from the consultants, it was a pretty
ragged me that set off to phone the family. Which was another thing --
we were 12,000 miles from home, and I had forgotten that in Scotland it
was the middle of the night. And just a few days away from Christmas.
So off they flew. When would they be back? Would he be back? We had no
idea. This is not about our son, directly, this is about how an ordinary
family handled a crisis, under quite trying circumstances. So I'll tell
you now that he did come back -- and go away again, several times. But
each time he came back.
I suspect that many of us panic when something relatively trivial goes
wrong, but we forget to do so when there's a real crisis. So it was with
us. By no means the well-oiled machine, we eventually got organised into
a routine. This was not just a one-off, one-week-later-all-is-OK event.
They were away for weeks at a time, my wife spending hours, days,
waiting for test results, holding a tiny hand which had a vice-like
grip, sleeping or dozing on chairs and camp beds. Not being sure where
and how to go about getting food. Seeing the specialists getting no
further forward. Becoming an authority on the perinatal care facilities
in New Zealand. And, unlike me, without friends or family nearby to
share the load except through endless, difficult phone conversations.
Most of us take hospitals and their staff for granted; we seldom think
of them until we need them. When we do have that need, it is almost as
if the place had been set up especially for us -- we forget that they
have a life and a routine of their own. Getting to know that life, that
routine, was essential.
We had to realise, and respect, that while we were important to the
doctors and nursing staff, we were not special. They had lots of babies
with all sorts of problems, and more arriving each day. Priorities
inevitably changed as somebody's condition worsened, or a special need
arrived. I for one was not prepared for what these people cope with
daily.
My daughter, then 19 months old, and I had it easy compared with the
other two. Being just the two of us became a way of life for several
months, one in which I had to do some work, too. Partly because it was
there to do, and also to occupy the mind. My first priority had to be to
make sure our daughter was well cared for and that her life carried on
reasonably normally.
There's no explaining to one so young quite what is going on but, none
the less, she sure did understand that something was wrong. She already
spent some mornings at a nursery, so it was a relief when they agreed to
take her for full days, and she got -- as she saw it -- more time to
play with her friends.
We were fortunate with the season. Summertime where we were can be
idyllic, and we spent many evenings in the parks, feeding ducks and
playing in the paddling pool. We visited the zoo regularly first thing
on a Sunday to see feeding time.
There were lots of picnics on the beach, just for two, the black sand
apparently being good to eat with mashed avocado. Our friends were just
great, and some were brave enough to keep our daughter over a weekend so
I could visit the other half of the family. But, inevitably, much of the
time you have to go it alone.It wasn't dreadfully serious all of the
time. There were plenty of bizarre and even funny little events -- like
being somewhat puzzled by a nurse's remark, just before the first
operation, that the surgeon didn't often lose his patience. The penny
dropped some time later that the word was ''patients''. Later, taking a
flight to Auckland and turning up at a hospital to find wife and son
were no longer there, and having to hunt down the nurse who knew where
they had gone. Not to mention the posh frock shop strategically placed
just outside the entrance to one hospital, where the therapeutic powers
of handing over large sums of money were tested by many including, out
of character, my wife.
Finally, we found that adversity brings people together in the
strangest ways -- our ''favourite'' nurse needed someone to talk to
about her home life, and she would stay on after her shift ended to
drink coffee and put her world to right. (An added bonus -- she provided
free biscuits from the nurses' room!)
And when you think it's all pretty well under control, and life is
settling down, that is the time something else is likely to happen. On
our way back home to the UK, when my posting ended a few months later,
we decided to stop over for a few days in Hawaii. We reckoned we
deserved the rest.
On the idyllic island of Maui, the phone in our apartment rang -- an
airline clerk informing us that they had only just reviewed our flight
file, 48 hours ahead of our scheduled departure, despite it being
labelled ''special need''.
We had received letters confirming all was OK, including carriage of
oxygen for our son, but those letters had been generated automatically
by computer.
Now a ''real person'' was ringing to cancel our reservations across
the US and the Atlantic because they could not carry the oxygen our son
might have needed. Having dumped that on us, and with no offer to help
us find an alternative carrier, this ''real person'' actually signed off
with ''Have a nice day'' . . .

This week's tip comes from MARK PATCHETT, the professional at
Broomieknowe Golf Club, Bonnyrigg, near Edinburgh.
FROM the low to the high handicapper, one of the most common faults is
poor alignment.
If you are shooting a gun, it is easy to aim at the target. What makes
golf so difficult is that you are having to look down to get a line
along to the target.
A good practice tip is to place two parallel clubs on the ground. One
club should point to the target and is the line for the ball and
clubface.
The other club will help to ensure that the feet, hips, and shoulders
are all parallel to the ball and the target line.
If you follow this drill, it will help get you into the correct
position. The most usual problem is aiming right of target with the
feet, and to the left of target with the shoulders.
From the top of the backswing, this poor set-up position leads to the
player hitting across the ball on an out-to-in pathway.
The result? A slice with the longer clubs such as the driver, and a
straight pull left with shorter clubs like the wedge.
Whenever you are on the practice ground, it is always a good idea to
place a couple of clubs on the ground to check alignment. And keep
practising -- it will help you develop the correct feel, and make it
become automatic on the course.

WHILE most clubs boast views of rustic splendour, King's Park, the
club based at the nine-hole municipal course in Glasgow, has an unusual
claim to fame. There, from the elevation of the fifth tee, you can see
three senior football grounds -- Parkhead, Ibrox, and Hampden.
This nugget of information is not entirely irrelevant. The club, which
is in its first full season for 20 years, has little in the way of
clubhouse facilities and resumed with its annual meeting at Hampden at
the tail end of last year, proof that Scotland's national football
stadium is sympathetic to alien sports.
The man responsible for the club's resurrection is 35-year-old Paul
King, a four-handicapper at Cathcart Castle who, although he plays for
that club's Brand Putter League team, has been given permission to
describe his home club as King's Park, which he does with some pride.
There might not be the same ambience, but it is certainly an
alternative to waiting up to 10 years for membership of one of the
well-heeled clubs in the city and its environs, then paying perhaps a
#1000 entry fee plus up to half again in annual subs.
There is no waiting list at King's Park and members are asked to pay
just #10 entry fee and #15 a year plus, of course, the modest green
fees. What's the catch then? And well you might ask.
It is that the club has access to the first tee only on Sunday
mornings between 7.45am and 8.30am, and for the second lap of a medal
round, groups are restricted to alternate times with the general public.
The result is a hardy bunch of 27 senior male members, three ladies,
and seven juniors, who have widened their horizons beyond simply turning
up for a knock. By affiliating to the Scottish Golf Union and Glasgow
Golf Union the men have bona fide handicaps and are thus welcome into
national club competitions and open tournaments at other clubs.
''The club has very much of a family atmosphere and that is the way we
want to keep it,'' said King, whose membership of the original King's
Park club ended in the early 1970s when he was the first of a mass
defection to Linn Park, where an 18-hole course was the attraction.
King chanced by his old club a couple of years ago and was intrigued
to see elaborate greenkeeping equipment in to put the course in better
order than he remembered. He also met an old friend who commented that
he wished there was a club for him to join.
''I decided then that I would go ahead and see what could be done --
and strangely enough my friend never actually joined,'' added King.
The paperwork is now complete with one exception. At 4142 yards with a
par of 64 for two laps, the course has a standard scratch score of 60 on
length alone, but it is scheduled for the new course rating exercise
when King is hopeful that the SSS will go up a stroke and perhaps two.
''I am concerned that handicaps here are too high,'' he explained. ''I
certainly can't play to four over this course and one of the members,
off 28, visited Kirkhill recently for a bounce game and was surprised to
find himself going round in 10 shots under his handicap.''
The juniors, meanwhile, have been receiving coaching from Cowglen's
John McTear through the Glasgow Golf Union programme and all have been
keen enough to complete the programme.
* THE Jimmy Heggarty Trophy, named after the late professional at
Cathkin Braes, has been rescheduled for June 25 at that club to avoid a
clash the previous weekend with the Scottish Strokeplay championship.
Entry to the 36-hole open scratch event, a counter for the Evening
Times Casket, is limited to those with handicaps of four or better.
GRant Thomson, of Eastwood, is the holder.
The entry fee is #8. Inquiries to the secretary, Cathkin Braes Golf
Club, tel. 0141 634 6605.
* A DRIVING range, the first part of a #1m project at Strathmore Golf
Centre at Alyth, Perthshire, opened for business this month.
It is to be followed in the next few weeks by a 1750-yard, par-29
nine-hole course, while the main 18-hole course, designed by local golf
course architect John Salveson, is due to open in May or June next year.

TODAY'S annual meeting of Lloyd's of London seems set to be a lively
affair coming just a week after the 300-year-old insurance market sued
for peace to end its bitter legal dispute with unhappy and frequently
ruined Names through the offer of a #2800m compensation package.
The offer to settle claims by Names, or indiviuals whose assets have
traditionally supported the insurance market, was accompanied by the
disclosure that Lloyd's had incurred a loss of #1200m in 1992, the
latest year for which accounts are available, taking the total to #7933m
since 1988.
The latest compensation package is more than three times the #900m
previously rejected by Names in 1994.
However, it does appear that Lloyd's chairman David Rowland and chief
executive Peter Middleton have done enough to ensure the survival of the
institution, particularly in persuading corporate members to put up
fresh funds. That is against the background of an increasing global
shortage of underwriting capacity which points to higher insurance rates
and therefore profit potential.
Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Association, said
he expected many Names to take the opportunity of the annual meeting to
question Mr Rowland about the offer.
Names who are currently suing Lloyd's agents would continue with their
legal actions as there was nothing they had heard so far to persuade
them otherwise.
The meeting is being held in the Royal Festival Hall in central
London. The hall can seat 2400, with an overspill area which can
accommodate a further 350.
Mr Stockwell added: ''In general, the action groups take the view it
is for the grassroots to ask the questions.''
Under the compensation plan, Lloyd's aims to make a ''clean break''
with its disaster years. There will be a ''firebreak'' whereby Lloyd's
agrees not to call on members to stump up any more cash for claims prior
to 1992.
Current Names, including new corporate investors, will be asked to pay
up to #900m into the refinancing.
''A lot of people so far have said it is not acceptable -- they can't
find anything that is in it for them,'' said Mr Stockwell.
However, Michael Deeny, who heads 20,000 Names taking legal action,
last week described the offer as representing ''victory''.
''There is now a prospect for a secure future. But we can't stop legal
action yet. The lawyers have to look over the exact terms.''
The 1992 loss came in a year when the insurance market was hit by
natural catastrophes such as Hurricane Andrew which devastated parts of
the United States, and the IRA bombings at Bishopsgate and St Mary Axe
in London.
Mr Rowland said 1992 marked the end of a ''period of serious losses''
with hopes of a #1000m profit for 1993.

IN the final round of the Tartan Special Scottish Professional
championship at Dalmahoy, Adam Hunter's tee shot at the second finished
up so close to trees that his backswing was impeded. He had an
unrestricted swing at the ball playing left-handed but his stance was
affected by a hole made by a burrowing animal.
He asked for and was given relief from the hole which came into play
on the left-handed scenario, but then, when the ball was in its new
position -- with the conventional backswing still impeded but not so
severely -- he played the shot right-handed and ended up with a par 4.
What rule allows this?
RULE 25 caters for abnormal ground conditions and the PGA tournament
controller referred to Decision 25-1b/22 which deals with a ball behind
a tree in such a position that a sideways stroke is the only reasonable
stroke, but a cast made by a burrowing animal interferes with the
backswing for that sideways stroke. The decision states that relief is
legitimate and if this gets the player out from behind the tree he is
entitled to play towards the green.
A similar principle is involved in Decision 24-2b/17 in which a player
is so close to a boundary fence that his only reasonable stroke is
left-handed, and a left-handed swing is interfered with by an immovable
obstruction. In that case the player is entitled to relief from the
obstruction. Once taken, the player may then use a right-handed swing.
This is a good example of how knowing the rules can help. But is it in
the spirit of the game? Well, would you call the bluff of a player of
the calibre of Adam Hunter and ask to see that left-handed shot with a
right-handed club?
He demonstrated it as a practice swing at the time in front of TV
cameras and it looked useful enough to get a better result than the
right-handed shot he had originally.

ANDREW POPPLE begins an occasional series on a dad's trials and
tribulations
FOR whatever reason, staying at work late into the evening is
commonplace for many managers, and for them the family hardly exists on
weekdays. We generally believe that a workaholic boss expects to see his
staff around him at all hours, irrespective of whether there is actual
need -- that ''weekend parenting'' is mostly the fault of our corporate
culture.
However, the alternative -- getting home earlier -- is perhaps not as
alluring as we would wish to believe. If these people were to arrive
home at, say, half six, what would be expected of them? Answer: To help
with the homework, maybe get tea, do the bathtime ritual, read stories.
The children want, perhaps need, the attention. And because they seldom
get it, they are likely to be as high as kites.
How readily do you switch from one demanding role to another,
especially when you are exhausted? Not easy, is it. Little surprise,
then, that some executives -- we are not talking about the supermen here
-- may not so much work long hours as attend for long hours. Creative
avoidance can be preferable to having to switch into a completely
different mindset, particularly if one has had a physically, mentally,
and perhaps even emotionally demanding day.
These anarchic thoughts came to life one evening during dinner with
friends. With us were a couple we were meeting for the first time. We
swopped ''New Man'' credentials, establishing all the things we did --
playing with our children, doing weekend meals, and so on. Then it
emerged. ''Of course, I never see the children during the week.''
He left home before the children got up, to avoid the morning rush --
at this time we were London commuters, a subset of the living dead. In
the evening he timed his departure from work to be sure his little
darlings were in bed before he got home.
New Manhood was confined to Saturday and Sunday, and only then did the
children see anything of their father. During the week he didn't exist.
He knew his limitations, and acted accordingly. His wife bore the brunt.
Since that evening, I've looked for the same behaviour in others. It
is undoubtedly rather more common than one might imagine. And it is not
confined to men. Women mostly expect to have to switch roles, without
the possibility of opt-out, and so do it. But one female professional
friend quite readily admits that on the evenings she works late, she is
wishing as she approaches her front door, ''please let them be in bed,
so I don't have to start work all over again''. The lure of the gin
bottle is, she tells me, purely incidental. Another doesn't see a
problem.
But why should the British be different to the rest of Europe, again?
Many southern Europeans would appear to have a rather more laid-back
attitude to work, which fits in better with a family life. The German
manager is probably so well organised he has 27-hour days.
Does the average Frenchman leave work early to go straight home or has
he, as legend would let us believe, un morceau on the side? In
Scandinavia some major corporations annualise their hours: in winter
they work very long days -- it's cold and dark, and their TV is worse
than ours. In summer, they take advantage of the long, light evenings to
do healthy, Scandinavian things. With a similar environment, why don't
we? Or perhaps they don't have midges.
Developing a different attitude to both the workplace and the home
would need time, and effort, all round. But the rewards would include
giving our children a more positive view of working life, perhaps having
a more human attitude in work, actually knowing the children better and
playing a more positive part in their development.
Anyone want to do a PhD on the cycle of fear, guilt, acceptance, etc,
involved in making the transition? Your contribution to halting the
erosion of family life could be most useful.

<TEXT>
KUWAITI-based trading house MA Kharafi &amp; Sons has increased its stake
in troubled construction group Richard Costain by 3.5% to 11%.
The purchase will not have made a dent in the privately-owned
construction company's cash balances of more than #2m with Costain
shares now languishing at 11p and with a total market capitalisation of
just #57m.
It has been suggested that the two businesses may co-operate in joint
ventures, particularly in the Gulf.
Costain incurred losses of #180m last year of which #142m related to
write-downs on the remaining US coal operations. These also incurred a
#40m trading loss. However, the construction and engineering activities
managed a #5m profit on turnover of #702m, while the on-going order book
in UK civil engineering is at an all-time record with total group work
outstanding over #500m.
The company has for a considerable period been prey to takeover
speculation but that is unlikely to be fulfilled until the US coal
activities are sold off. It is generally considered they are too small
in a sector increasingly dominated by companies such has Hanson's
Peabody Coal and RTZ as the two largest UK players.
One attraction of Costain is its high level of technical skills which
would be of interest to competitors. But there is little incentive by
way of net asset value with analysts arguing that it is little different
from the share price rather than the ''north of 20p'' of chairman
Richard Costain.

THE women scratch golfers are obviously taking longer than usual to
warm up. After five weeks of Parbusters '95, which represents more than
10,000 rounds of golf among the ladies, not one has equalled the
standard scratch score.
Morag Wright, of Largs, came close this week, her 73 in the club's May
Medal representing a score of plus one.
But if you compare this to the men -- and arguably it is comparable
given forward tees and the higher SSS women play to -- level or one
under their competition scratch score is so commonplace that we are not
listing them any more and this week no fewer than 16 are on minus two or
better. Calum Davidson, of Dunblane New takes pride of place with a
scratch 65 which equates to a Parbusters score of minus five.
Bandit of the week is Bothwell Castle's Danny O'Shea who beat his 15
handicap by 11 shots in the qualifying round for the club's Forgie Cup
competition, and he beat another Danny Boy, playing partner Rafferty of
that ilk playing off 12, by a mere shot. Their handicaps have been cut
by three and two shots respectively.
There was, by the way, a third member of that group who was left in
the shade on minus four. This week's leading scores:
HANDICAP
Men
-11 -- D O'Shea, Bothwell Castle (15).
-10 -- D Rafferty, Bothwell Castle (12).
- 9 -- I McDonald, Tam O'Shanter (19); W Anderson, Drumpellier (9).
Women
-9 -- K MacKenzie, Golspie (19); M Gray, Cochrane Castle, over Comrie
(18).

-7 -- S MacKinlay, Carradale (19); F Campbell, Largs (29).
SCRATCH
Men
-5 -- C Davidson, Dunblane New.
-3 -- G J Tyre, Cowal; J Farrell, Cathkin Braes; L Anson, Bellshill; E
Moir, Hamilton; G D Stubbs, Dun Whinny; S Kennedy, Dumfries &amp; County.
-2 -- S T Lindsay, Prestwick St Cuthbert; J McAllister Jr, Crow Wood;
B Genese, Stirling; K J McArthur, Stirling; M Moir, Hamilton; H S

<HEADLINE>City eagerly awaitingrenewed bid for VSEL</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978141317</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE City is looking forward with eager anticipation for British
Aerospace to fire the first cannon in the renewed battle with GEC for
control of Barrow based submarine-maker VSEL.
That was stopped late last year when President of the Board of Trade
Michael Heseltine referred both offers to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
An opening shot based on the original 3.3 BAe shares for each VSEL
would be worth #17.35 with BAe closing at 526p last Friday.
It has become an even more attractive prospect to both sides after it
revealed annual profit figures to the end of March last week showing its
cash pile had grown from #322m to #411m.
The figures, which showed pre-tax profits rising by #3.5m to #64.5m,
came a day after Mr Heseltine announced that both BAe and GEC were free
to renew their bids for VSEL.
He referred both bids to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in
December and overruled its finding that the GEC offer should be blocked
on public interest grounds.
The Commission had concluded that the BAe offer was not against the
public interest, but it believed the bid by GEC was because the group
would control two of the three remaining warship yards -- it already
owns Yarrow on the Clyde.
Many analysts in the City fear BAe might overreach itself in the
bidding war with GEC but it can pay up to #20 without feeling any
significnt pain. There is a belief that GEC if it fails in its attempt
to win VSEL, might in time try to gobble up BAe, including VSEL, to
become the all-pervading, prime UK defence contractor.

IT'S a measure of just how much work by Theatre de Complicite has
entered the bloodstream of British theatre life that Told By An Idiot's
I'm So Big seems a chip off the old Complicite block. Hayley
Carmichael's gallery of dirty old men in dark homburgs and crumpled
joints, for example, could have come straight out of Kathryn Hunter's
top drawer.
But Told By An Idiot, formerly The John Wright Company, draw their
inspiration from an even wider range of foreign brews, though the whole
beauty of the Complicite phenomenon is their eclecticism. For Told By An
Idiot is formed from performers who have also worked with David Glass
and physical/mime group The Right Size.
I'm So Big, however, seems to derive its spirit from something even
further back, those Italian films of the 50s, where bitter-sweet love
affairs between itinerant outsiders summed up the plight of a battered
but not entirely down-and-out post-war Europe. Here three destitute
characters become engaged in a bitter-sweet escapade involving an
on-stage caravan, exploitation, dreams, and love.
At once wistful and playful but by no means unchallenging, there are
lovely performances by Carmichael, Paul Hunter as the older brother
Maximo, and Javier Marzan, a rueful, leggy clown and major discovery.
Told By An Idiot look set for great things and set out in July for an
eight-week tour of South Africa including a visit to Johannesburg's
famous Market Theatre. At the same time, one of their administrator's
other pet projects, the South African Mouthpiece Theatre are returning
to the Edinburgh Festival (they were at the Traverse in '91 with The
Ugly No No) in a new show, Feed-Back, at the Assembly Rooms.

DAWSON International, the Pringle woollens group, is set to reveal
that its painful recovery is on course -- though it is unlikely to have
made a profit during the year to the end of March.
In the previous 12 months, the Edinburgh-based group plunged into the
red to the tune of #95.4m.
Brokers UBS believe that in the latest financial year the group will
have broken even after exceptional one-off costs.
The restructuring of its Pringle operation, the closure of a
yarn-spinning plant in Ayrshire and the change of company-owned retail
stores into franchises will result in a total of 500 job losses.
The 1993-94 results were characterised by write-offs totalling #106m
on its US fleece and jersey businesses.
The group's problems stemmed from its major expansion in the US in
1984, when it bought JE Morgan, a long-established maker of thermal
underwear.
Other businesses were bought, including producers of T-shirts,
lightweight underwear, fleece and shower curtains.
All was well until 1990 when profits from the US businesses climbed
while those from the UK fell, because of changes in fashion and problems
in obtaining cashmere wool.
But then the retailing environment in America changed. Manufacturers
were required to be able to supply large volumes on indications of
demand rather than firm orders from the retail chains and Dawson's
subsidaries were not large enough to cope.
Earlier this month it announced the sale of its loss-making Dawson
Home Fashions subsidiary in the US for between $40m and $45m (#25m to
#28m).
The sale will result in an exceptional one-off loss of up to 15
million dollars which will be written into the latest results.
Pringle itself also faced problems last year as the company decided on
a strategy of expanding its product range and developing retail outlets.
''It complicated the logistics of the business which became difficult
to manage and demand was hit by the warm winter weather,'' said Derek
Finlay in March on his appointment as chairman following the resignation
of Sir Ronald Miller.
Pringle is now being slimmed back to its core knitwear business.

We may disapprove of political incorrectness, but it can be a powerful
temptation for young readers, as Mark Fisher discovers
Neil was a naughty boy. A very naughty boy. You see, Neil did smells.
All the time. Rotten, disgusting smells. On purpose. Sneaky, steamy,
silent smells.
SO begins the first story in the first collection of Christopher
Milne's Naughty Stories for Good Boys and Girls. Over the past three
years in his native Australia Milne has sold a total of 140,000 copies
of this and eight other books in the series -- all self-published. In
that time he's hardly once been out of the top 10 best-sellers list.
Adults may be shocked, but children love him.
If the book industry had had its way, however, he'd never have made it
into print. ''When I first sent my stories to the six major publishers
they all said 'no', fairly brutally in some cases,'' he recalls. ''I
argue that children aren't reading any more and that is due solely to
the spinelessness of major publishers. Children's publishers are acting
like over-zealous thought-police.''
Milne is turning up for the Scottish International Children's
Festival, which runs all next week in Edinburgh, and will be doing
readings both there and at Glasgow's Mitchell Theatre the following
week. He is a man with a mission -- to prove that there's life in
children's fiction yet, but only if it can escape the clutches of
self-censorship that have gripped the publishing industry.
''It's become a shocking state of affairs,'' he says. ''Even if you've
written something that doesn't offend anyone, the editors go through it
and make sure that boys and girls have exactly 50% of the action and
that everything they do is pro-environment and not remotely sexist or
racist. As long as something can be demonstrated to be racist or sexist
in a story then it is legitimate story-telling that reflects where our
community currently is at. Because publishers are looking for scripts
that are non-this and non-that, they end up being non-anything.''
After spells writing for Prisoner Cell Block H, acting in Neighbours
(as the original Philip Martin) and script-editing for The Sullivans,
Milne took to writing for children at the behest of his two sons, who
were so impressed by his bedtime stories that they wanted him to retell
them to their friends. Undeterred by rejection slips, Milne struck a
deal with a sympathetic printer, designed a low-budget cover himself and
went into print with 1000 copies. A sceptical bookshop manager, feeling
sorry for him, agreed to stock the title for a one-week trial period,
and was staggered at its immediate success.
Now, Milne is in the privileged position of being able to turn away
those same publishers who had once spurned him and who, having got a
glimpse of his sales record, have suddenly decided that they're not so
principled after all.
In truth, there is a moral heart to all of Milne's stories; it's just
that he recognises that what gets children reading is the chance of
coming across plum phrases like ''doggie doos'', ''goobies that hang out
of your nose'', and ''Oh look, his willie's turned blue!'' He claims
research shows that although the sales of children's books are as high
as ever, they're not actually being read any more. Children are
accepting the books, sticking them on the shelf and returning to the far
less sanitised world of television.
And it would appear that the British publishing industry is no
different to its Australian counterpart. The battle for the minds and
morals of our children is being fiercely fought and it's a highly
sensitive issue. You wouldn't believe the number of unreturned telephone
calls and off-the-record remarks I've had while researching this
article. Such caution is partly justified. People don't want to be
involved in the kind of reactionary and ill-informed anti-political
correctness debate so beloved of the tabloids. There are important
issues at stake. Take a look, for example, at the first edition of Roald
Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and you'll be shocked at its
casual racism. It seems to me perfectly reasonable that subsequent
editions for our more enlightened times have dropped the references to
pygmy workers being imported from darkest Africa.
But are our more enlightened times so sensitive to the vulnerabilities
of our children that when you buy a packet of Cadbury's Dairy Milk
Buttons the nursery rhyme on the back will tell you that the old woman
who lived in a shoe didn't whip her children at all but ''kissed'' them
all soundly and sent them to bed? The man from Cadbury's assures me that
they just went for the milder of a choice of published versions, though
they do have to be careful when catering for the mass market.
Indeed it's an innocuous enough change (and it's only what they've
been doing to the Brothers Grimm for generations), but as Terry
Saunders, editor of Junior Education Magazine says, there is a real
danger that children will start to lose interest in fiction altogether.
''While everyone would do everything they possibly could to eradicate
any possible offence, I think in some cases story books are losing their
drive and excitement,'' she says.
''Children's imaginations are being terribly limited,'' confirmed one
Glasgow-based education expert. A number of often quite small pressure
groups have made such an impression on the publishing industry that it
is now virtually impossible to write stories involving pigs (for fear of
offending Muslims), witches (Christians), soldiers (pacifists), fairies
(Christians again), alternative creation myths (and again), or nasty old
people (the anti-ageism lobby).
''We must be careful,'' warns Terry Saunders. ''The awareness that
political correctness has brought is very important. What we're talking
about is offence -- and we should not be causing offence. I would come
down on the side of political correctness because it makes people aware,
and making people aware is what literature is meant to do. We should be
teaching children that offensive remarks can be hurtful. But you can
write good, exciting stories and not offend.''
Which, for all his bums and scum-bags, is pretty much what Christopher
Milne is doing. ''Toilet humour is the forbidden fruit for children and
political incorrectness does appeal,'' he says. ''But in my stories the
children are often empowered to solve their own problems -- and
empowerment is one of the most politically correct notions of today.
I've found that you can tell a moral story without it being too
heavy-handed if it's spiced with some good toilet humour.''
* Events for children feature at the Mitchell Theatre, Glasgow, 0141
305 7666, from tomorrow to June 3.

YOU go to a jazz club. You meet some new people. The conversation's a
bit stilted until you hit on a subject of mutual interest. The weather
usually.
The club patrons? No, I'm talking about the musicians because it
wasn't until they opened the second half with September in the Rain that
American guitarist Ron Jackson and the local trio of Jack Finlay
(piano), Bill Kyle (drums), and the rather more resourceful Brian Shiels
(bass) really started to communicate.
Boston-based Jackson is a graduate of that city's famous Berklee
School of Music so his technical ability was never in any doubt. It was
his own personal stamp on the music that needed drawing out.
Much of the first half was spent establishing credentials: the ability
to play fluently at speed, to play the scampering octaves so beloved of
Wes Montgomery and his disciple George Benson, and to play a ballad with
a delicate touch.
''September'' confirmed what the pre-interval waltz-time blues had
suggested -- that Jackson on autopilot can indeed be an exciting,
independently-minded player. He knows the power of a simple phrase
repeated one time less than once too often and appreciates the dramatic,
but sometimes comic effect of a well-timed quote. Dizzy Gillespie's Sho'
Nuff, one I Got Rhythm variant, led almost inevitably to a cheeky snatch
from another, the Flintstones theme.
One of Jackson's favourite composers is Antonio Carlos Jobim, and with
How Insensitive and Emily he showed equally good taste in execution as
he did in selection, although his promising take on the Brazilian
master's Triste was hampered by that aforementioned stilted,
non-bossa-friendly conversation.

CHURCH acoustics can do strange things to string quartets. In such
surroundings, warmth of tone usually takes precedence over rhythmic
bite, not necessarily to the music's disadvantage when two quartets
combine to play Mendelssohn's octet the way they did at the Perth
Festival on Sunday.
This was the highlight of a concert in which the Endellion Quartet,
this year's quartet-in-residence, was joined by the SCO Quartet in a
performance so radiant that contrapuntal definition seemed, for once, of
no great consequence. As the electricity generated by eight ardent
players sent the finale circling through its paces, fine detail was
simply swept aside by the exciting torrent of string tone.
Where fine detail was really essential -- as in the gossamer scherzo
-- the performance was less arresting. A somewhat slower tempo might
have helped here, if Mendelssohn's pattering rhythms were to make their
point, but slowness at St John's Kirk is not invariably the answer.
Earlier in the evening, the great adagio of Beethoven's E flat major
quartet, Op 127, sounded simply soggy.
Indeed the first half of the concert, featuring the Endellion on its
own, never quite fulfilled the promise of Stravinsky's Capriccio, whose
tempo changes and sonorities were so impressively dealt with at the
start. The Beethoven, in general, lacked body, and suffered from a
rhythmic instability for which one was inclined to blame the performance
as much as the church.

There is a lively argument raging in Scotland over the nature of the
arts and their purpose -- and The Herald is at its forefront. Here our
Arts Editor, Keith Bruce, sets the scene while below Robin Mitchell of
Clyde Unity Theatre puts his case.
THERE are those who maintain that Mayfest director Paul Bassett's
championing of home-grown product in his first programme was as much
financially-inspired as derived from a desire to return the festival to
the people of the West of Scotland -- and that his subsequent
justification of the bill of fare on offer this past month was the
cleverest piece of public relations Mayfest achieved.
None the less, his argument has chimed with other voices entering the
arts debate on these pages. Herald visual arts critic Clare Henry
questioned the purpose of the Trust exhibition at Glasgow's Tramway --
citing the lack of interest in it outside from local people and the lack
of guidance to it inside for ''difficult work''.
That accusation was sharply rebutted by Charles Esche of the city's
Department of Performing Arts and Venues in Thursday's Herald, but the
argument was not over, as a rowdy open meeting before the opening of
Robert Lepage's Dream Play at the venue confirmed. It is that production
-- and that production alone -- that has focused the attention of the
national media on Glasgow again, yet no-one would attempt to ascribe to
it the broad populist appeal that Bassett's Mayfest promoted.
Last week Herald theatre critic Mark Fisher questioned the value of
the (often distinctively West of Scotland) popular theatre that is
regularly provided by West of Scotland-based companies, arguing that
there is a problem in this TV-age with live work that requires only a
passive response from the public. Below, Robin Mitchell of Clyde Unity
Theatre questions the presumptions -- his own and other people's -- that
surround our definition of ''popular'' theatre.
It seems to us here in the Herald arts eyrie that all of these strands
-- Mayfest, the Tramway's exhibitions, and the nature of popular drama
-- are part of the same debate. It is one that ranges from the
unanswerable philosophical interrogation: ''What is art?'', to the
rather more pertinent question of how Glasgow -- and by implication
other cities -- use the arts to promote themselves. What image is
Glasgow trying to promote of itself at home and abroad -- and is that
best served by Donnie Burns and Gaynor Fairweather at The Shed or Robert
Lepage and Christine Borland at Tramway?
The Herald Arts Forum is in session. Please let us know what you
think.
Every setting tells a story.
IN The Herald last week, Mark Fisher was driven to suggest that there
is a ''gulf of misunderstanding between audiences and reviewers'' and
finding himself at odds with the bulk of the audience attending the
Billy Connolly play at the Pavilion.
Had someone forgotten to let him in on the joke, he mused, or was it
in fact the case that ''popular theatre'' audiences lacked
discrimination and are unable to spot a bad play when it hit them in the
proscenium arch? If this is true, does it mean that audiences for other
forms of theatre are by nature astute and discerning, and in any case
does anyone really know how to distinguish between popular theatre and
non-popular theatre?
As set designer for Clyde Unity Theatre, I am in the envied position
(among members of the company, you understand) that I don't have to be
at every single performance of their current production, Breadmakers.
Rather, I have been the company's link with the world of Mayfest, and
have been able to report back on a host of theatre productions they
haven't had the chance to see.
These have included productions of Easy, Born Guilty and Persons
Unknown at the Citizens' Theatre, Needles and Opium at the Kings and The
Crucible, Asylum, Asylum and Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens
at The Arches. Been there, done that, seen the reviews.
And what of the reviews? The ladies and gentleman of the press have
been known to get it terribly, terribly wrong (ie when I don't agree
with them). But it has to be said that over the past few weeks newspaper
crits for the above-mentioned shows would appear to reflect the
reactions of audiences at performances I've attended.
But these examples are all taken from subsidised, or ''not always
quite so popular theatre'' and fall into a different category from
Borderline Billy Connolly plays.
Why? Is it simply that the audience loved it and the press didn't,
therefore it must be popular theatre? Or is it the transforming effect
of the venue -- Borderline is a subsidised theatre company working in
this case with the commercial management of the Pavilion -- which can
create instant popularity, regardless of how many turn up on the night.
When I hear the term ''popular theatre'' I usually presume it refers
to productions which can fill the Pavilion or King's (no other theatre
need apply), has everyone speaking in Glesga accent, except for toffs
who can be English, and includes at least one cast member from Rab C
Nesbit or, failing that, someone from City Lights.
My definition adds that such drama rarely exists outside Glasgow, and
I might also jump to the conclusion that the audience for this show
would not be likely be spotted in the Citizens' Studio watching Robert
David Macdonald's Persons Unknown. This is not to put any value judgment
on people's taste in theatre, but to acknowledge that different shows
attract different audiences, and to label some shows as ''popular
theatre'' tells us very little about the people who go to see them.
Over the years I have worked on a range of shows with Clyde Unity
Theatre, touring with them to tiny wee community halls and established
theatre venues. It is very clear that as the venue changes, so does the
audience. A Little Older, for example, played to an international
audience of academics, artists, tourists and regular theatre-goers at
the Fringe in 1992 before transfering to Hampstead to play to an
audience consisting largely of ladies from the local Jewish community.
Since then, this very Scottish play has toured Glasgow community
centres and been performed in Germany, Singapore and the US. Similarly,
the Breadmakers tour runs the gamut from the luxurious main theatre at
the Citizens' to the friendly, squashy Springburn Elderly and Disabled
Centre, and each venue brings in a different crowd.
Some are local, others have travelled a fair distance. Some are Clyde
Unity regulars, many are fans of Margaret Thomson Davis's source novel,
others are attracted by the revues, the Glaswegian story or the
company's reputation. Whatever brings them in, they then respond to the
production in different ways, finding humour in different scenes,
recognising local references and songs and identifying with the
characters.
Some do see aspects of their own lives reflected on the stage. The
central character in Breadmakers, Catriona, marries in haste to escape
her overbearing Ma, only to repent at leisure. When she later
miscarries, there is an audible wave of sympathy towards her, more
pronounced in some venues than others.
In short, there is much more, and sometimes significantly less, to
good theatre than a good script. If the script was always first-class,
our theatre would be the richer for it. If it is poor it is a wasted
opportunity, and the production's potential is stifled before it gets to
see a spotlight. None the less, the audience can still find other
avenues for their enjoyment, not least of which is the experience of
being in a packed theatre surrounded by others determined to have a good
night out.
It is to be lamented that Billy Connolly's plays are currently the
standard bearers for Scottish popular theatre.
It is perhaps more important, however, to question the classification
of theatre performances which makes genuinely popular and well-scripted
theatre produced by subsidised companies, such as Clyde Unity Theatre's
Breadmakers, TAG's Sunset Song and the Citizens' Swing Hammer Swing
ineligible for the title.

The constant derision of Scottish productions by London critics is
unjust, suggests SARA VILLIERS.
WORDS fail me. Almost. Let's not get a chip on our shoulders about
this, but there seems to be something seriously amiss when a show which
was universally applauded in Scotland, sold out houses two years in a
row, swept up awards and inspired the most reserved of critics to
effusive superlatives, opens in London to nothing less than sneers of
derision. The curse of small-minded metropolitanism strikes again,
methinks.
The Tron Theatre Company's production of Dumbstruck was a major hit of
last year's Mayfest, and earlier this year enjoyed a successful second
run, touring around Scotland to packed theatres filled with both fresh
fans and those eager for second helpings of David Kane's wickedly
inventive farce.
Newcastle audiences were similarly appreciative, and by the time the
show arrived in London earlier this month it was garlanded with official
approbabation, as an LWT ''Plays on Stage'' award winner and the Writer
Guild Best New Regional Play, as well as other prestigious nominations.
London critics, however, were generally unimpressed, and the play was
greeted with headlines like ''Dazed, or just confused?'' (The Times) and
damned as a production with ''as many dead moments as there are seeming
stiffs on stage'' (Time Out). As a critic, I'd be the first to defend
their right to express their opinion, but I can't help suspecting that
that opinion is coloured by a disrespect for Scottish culture, so
patronising was the general tone of the response: ''Remind me never to
go to Mayfest'' sneered What's On's Neil Smith.
Sure, London has praised Scottish shows, like Liz Lochhead's Quelques
Fleur or the Traverse's fashionably cultish Trainspotting. Nonetheless,
the capital's critics can be intolerant of work with a strong Scottish
perspective, as evinced in the bashing recently meted out to The Maiden
Stone at Hampstead Theatre, with cavils aimed at playwright Rona Munro's
use of Doric dialogue.
It's a prejudice which has been well aired regarding television shows
-- while shows like Taggart and Rab C Nesbitt have found network favour,
English reviewers constantly object to the strong accents -- and it is
worrying that it also has a grip on the theatre. David Kane, an
acclaimed writer for both stage and screen, was unsurpised by the London
response, although naturally irritated by the vilification of his work
-- ''Why have director Michael Boyd and Glasgow's Tron Theatre bothered
to give this script, which needs sharp editing, such a professional
staging?'' asked The Times.
''I half expected it and you can't let it upset you, but what did
irritate me was the particularly condescending tone of the reviews,''
says Kane, pointing out that when he wrote his first television film
Shadow on the Earth for the BBC, they asked him to relocate it from West
Lothian to Liverpool. He had to point out that there were no shale
mines, the subject matter of the film, in Liverpool.
He feels a similar cultural ignorance has underpinned the London
reviews. Dumbstruck, set in a Glasgow theatrical boarding house in the
sixties and peopled with eccentric characters, including the murderously
ambitious rock'n'roll singer Johnny Ramone (Jimmy Chisholm) and a
sinister German-Scots magician-cum-euthanasiast Herman Katz (Forbes
Masson), is a deliberately overblown parody of Scottish music hall
traditions. Kane suspects London reviewers failed to get the joke.
Personally, I'm fed up with big glossy shows touring to Scotland,
marketed as ''Direct from London's West End'' -- a tag which often
offers little more than an indication of commerical success, trumpeting
slick and soulless shows. When shows of the winning calibre of
Dumbstruck are blasted it is time to stop worrying about seeming
defensively patriotic and instead be defiantly proud and note that, at
times, there is nowhere in Britain as parochial as London.

PITCHED as a psychological thriller, Richard Harris's drama is a
dreary letdown. The psychological explanation is shallow in the extreme
and the only thrill to be had from the production is watching Pollyanna
as a femme fatale -- and that's a weak buzz as Hayley Mills is too
dispassionate to be convincingly wicked.
Mills and Jenny Seagrove star as Margaret and Julia, two women who
build an uneasy friendship after Julia is injured in the car crash which
kills Margaret's husband, John. The older woman seeks Julia out to
satiate her grief by learning more about the moment of John's death,
inspiring guilt in Julia who was his mistress.
Seagrove's astonishing iridescent beauty lights up the stage, but as
an actress she fails even to flicker. It's hardly surprising given the
woodiness of her character, who is crippled not only by a leg injury
(unconvincingly played) but also some of the lamest lines I have heard
in the theatre. Supposedly satirical, Julia's wit extends to cracks
about her home help, Gary (Niall Refoy) being her ''daily male'' and a
wincingly cliched joke comparing lawyers with lab rats.
Harris's success as a stage dramatist bewilders me as his plays lack
any sign of theatrical flair. Here, all the action is set in Julia's
London home, a naturalistic clutter of middle-class good taste, and the
narrative trundles along via endless truncated scenes. An occasional
''there's someone in the attic'' lighting gag provides the only frisson
of fear throughout the whole sluggish proceedings.
The dialogue is pedestrian, the characterisations unconvincing, and
the putative ''tension'' is derived from a plot twist so glaringly
signposted that when revealed it's almost a surprise, it's so bleeding
obvious.

ANOTHER circular from a leading team of City analysts has just
fluttered across my desk. ''For June, if not for several months beyond,
an interest rate rise is off the agenda'' it concludes. This particular
circular is dated May 26.
Just weeks before, on May 5 to be precise, the same team of what Nigel
Lawson once mischievously dubbed teenage scribblers was telling us it
expected a half-point rise in base rates that very day. ''The economic
arguments may be finely balanced but an increase is in the market and
failure to move would put the Government's anti-inflation credentials in
doubt and risk swift retribution from the foreign exchange and gilt
markets,'' the team confidently predicted.
Two months before that, on March 8, the same team was telling us it
saw ''no move on rates this month, or indeed for some time unless the
pressure on sterling turns into a full-blown crisis''.
It went on: ''At a time when the authorities are receiving very
different signals from various parts of the economy, we expect them to
wait until the overall picture becomes more clear. And when it does, we
suspect the slowdown domestically will weigh more heavily than the
relative buoyancy of the export sectors.''
It would be invidious to name the authors of this particular
now-you-see-it-now-you-don't analysis. They were certainly not alone in
assuming -- spectacularly wrongly as it turned out -- that Kenneth
Clarke had no option but to put interest rates up on May 5, for the
fourth time since September. Virtually the whole City and large sections
of the media were united in viewing a further rise as inevitable.
Some remain convinced that, when Chancellor Clarke and Bank of England
Governor Eddie George next meet, on June 7, the half-point rise which
never was in May will materialise, late but just as inevitably, in June.
Once more, I suspect, they will be sorely disappointed.
What disposes me to grant anonymity to the authors of the clutch of
conflicting quotes with which I started this column is the underlying
rationality of much of their analysis. They correctly identified signs
of a slowdown in domestic demand earlier than most. Sadly, at the vital
moment, they ditched reason and ran with the herd. But, I'm a forgiving
sort of chap.
They were right to conclude, as they did in March, that the slowdown
in the domestic UK economy would weigh more heavily with the Chancellor
than finding a soft landing for a booming export sector, already
enjoying another bout of sterling devaluation thanks to the strength of
the yen and the mark. Exports, after all, account for no more than 20%
of the whole economy. And exports don't have votes.
The trouble with too many of the City's teenage scribblers -- given
their six-figure salaries and bonus-buttressed lifestyles -- is that
they have little or no first-hand experience of the daily pressures on
millions of ordinary citizens. They spend so many hours in front of
their computer screens crunching data they know little of how the rest
of the world struggles to cope with relentless job uncertainty or yet
another bout of unemployment.
Nor are they forced to swallow, like the nurses, below-inflation pay
rises which, in the small print of reduced holiday entitlement, pruned
overtime rates or disappearing allowances, take away as much as -- or
rather more than -- they appear to offer. And although they were hit,
this April and last, with the same massive package of tax increases
which clobbered the rest of us, the hit bears much more heavily on
average wage earners than on those on City-style salaries.
But now even the official numbers on their screens are demonstrating
the scale of the problem. The first three months of this year saw total
consumer expenditure fall, for the first time since the recession
officially ended three years ago.
That dip between January and March was only 0.1%, or 0.3% if the
effect of spending on the National Lottery is excluded. But add in
detail like the lamentable state of much of the housing market, tumbling
car sales to private buyers, and stagnant demand in key areas of the
high street, like household goods, and you have a cocktail of warning
signals any Chancellor -- particularly one with Clarke's keenly tuned
political antennae -- ignores at his, and his party's, peril.
The Chancellor knows, better than those colleagues who prattle on
about unspecified mid-term unpopularity, precisely why a deeply
aggrieved public is punishing his party's candidates at poll after poll.
He must also know that winning the next election is not just about
meeting the underlying inflation target of 2.5% he has set himself for
the end of this Parliament. Winning is now about giving back to the
broad mass of the electorate some semblance of a feeling of economic
wellbeing.
Since May 5, when he and George agreed to differ on the need for a
further interest rate hike, it's been game, set, and match to Clarke, in
my view. He may be distrusted by many in his party as a dangerous
beer-swilling leftie, too Euro-phile by three-quarters, but the
Chancellor has seen off all predictions of apocalypse now in the
markets, since that no-rate-change decision on May 5.
He has surreptitiously undermined George's credibility, by letting it
be known in the right places that the Bank of England's track record on
predicting UK inflation has been over-pessimistic for too long. By last
Friday, the Chancellor felt sufficiently relaxed to puff on a Hamlet
Special and tell the Financial Times he is ruling out further deep cuts
in the next public spending round this autumn.
I am not predicting great things for Clarke. Unlike those City lads
and lasses, I decided a long time back that trying to predict the future
is a mug's game. All I'm saying, at a time when it is fashionable to
write off Clarke's political prospects, is that he's still worth a lot
of watching.

SOME four years ago, on the brink of Desert Storm, I spent an
afternoon with that most interesting man, Canon Kenyon Wright. We spent
much of it trying to establish the criteria for a just war. The concept,
today, is distinctly unfashionable. Most of us incline either to
pacifism -- such as my friend Pat Kane, whom once I heard proudly
declare that he would not have fought even to destroy Nazism -- or to
the jingoistic, dead-Argies-more-pictures mode of the Sun during the
Falklands conflict.
As I write, the subject has become highly topical. We have spent much
of 1995 recalling the final destruction of the Third Reich a
half-century ago. Britain is about to commit 6000 or more troops to the
Balkans. For four years our international bodies -- the EU, the United
Nations, NATO -- have footered uselessly in that hopeless tribal
conflict. It is time, perhaps, to remind ourselves precisely when war
can be justified and how a just war should be fought.
We must start on the necessary premise that war is an immense evil.
War is destruction, wasting, bloodshed, and ruin. War is peril for its
wagers, misery for its victims, a curse on humanity, and a soiling of
the earth. All man's resources in war are perverted in the negative and
the ghastly. Our best scientists and engineers devise new ways to kill.
Our ablest artists and writers spin propaganda. Statesmen meet to play
draughts with the lives of youth. Ethics are inverted. In the cause of
war we must resort to methods -- deception, violence, sabotage,
mantraps, vandalism, forgery -- which, in time of peace, would be
criminal or immoral.
And yet Wright and I had to agree, as I recall, that there could
indeed be occasion when war was justified. I hate war. I hope I will
never fight in one and, as I age steadily, it seems improbable that I
ever will. But I believe there can in truth be a just war, a war that
may be fought without shame, if it matches certain moral grounds.
First: a just war is of necessity defensive in origin. He who launches
war launches evil on the earth. To invade an unsuspecting land, to
initiate conflict with a peaceful neighbour, to march merely in the name
of territorial expansion or vainglory -- such war cannot be justified.
But a country fighting for survival against an aggressive neighbour, or
men fighting to protect hearth and home and kindred from barbarity, are
fighting in a righteous cause, and obeying the highest instincts of
humanity.
Secondly: a just war is fought towards a clear and limited goal. It is
waged to reverse the evil which has called you to arms. The invader is
to be repelled. Or the tyrant is to be overthrown. Should the just war
spill over from its original vision; or if men, having won back the
liberty of their land, then embark on the conquest of the earth, the war
has ceased to be defensible or moral.
Thirdly: a just war is waged justly. Cruel and barbaric means of
fighting are repudiated. Hideous weapons, chemical or biological, are
not a moral option. Schools and hospitals are not to be bombed. Every
effort is made to minimise civilian casualties. One may mock the many
inconsistencies of such international codes as the Geneva Convention --
it is hard, for instance, to see why you can roast a lad with napalm but
are forbidden to kill cleanly with explosive bullets -- yet such
standards are born of a sincere desire to dignify the unthinkable.
And, fourthly: a just war must be won. If your position is desperate,
and the odds overwhelmingly against you, you should seriously question
the wisdom of resorting to arms at all. There are foes too overwhelming,
risks too incalculable, and situations so complex that just war cannot
be effectively waged. Blood should not be shed in pointless crusades.
Only the mad glory in last stands, lost causes, and forlorn hopes. But
war is about killing. War is about death. Life may be ventured; it
should never be wasted.
So we concluded that day. In the light of experience, and further
thought, I should add a fifth point of my own. A just war, matching all
these tests, is to be fought hard and fought with vigour. War, in all
reverence, is hell. It should be as short and final as possible. The
just war, then, should be waged with overwhelming force. It should be
directed with bold decision. It should be planned by the finest minds,
launched with the maximal resources available, and focused on a certain
purpose against the evil's weakest flank.
In my own recent experience I have seen the great misery and damage
resulting from the feeble efforts of good men. Those who consistently
underestimate the wickedness of the foe, who fail to match their drive
of will and clarity of goal, who shrink from deploying the strongest
methods in pursuit of a noble aim -- such are worse than useless. They
pussyfoot about and pass motions. They remit, delay, report, and refer.
They lack guts and they lack purpose. While they timidly tinker, the
righteous weep and the innocent suffer.
Some of the wars in which madder patriots still shroud themselves in
glory fall by these tests. The American Civil War should have been won
in six months with minimal casualties. It lasted over four years and
left one million Americans dead, because such Union generals as George
McLellan were timorous and stupid, consistently assuming the worst,
lacking drive and decisiveness.
The Boer War was a wicked war of aggression and greed, fought against
decent peace-loving people. In their greed for African gold, the British
Empire invented the concentration camp and sowed a hatred that grew
fruit in apartheid.
The Great War was one of the most pointless and vainglorious conflicts
ever fought, launched with little more skill or point than a football
fixture, born of secret treaties, inane nationalism, and a willingness
to squander the lives of men. Those who died in the First World War died
for nothing. (And I have that from a good man who fought all the way
through it and was wounded three times.)
Much has been made of the American debacle in Vietnam. It should not
be forgotten that the cause, of itself, was just: whatever might be said
of South Vietnam and her rulers, North Vietnam was infinitely worse, and
intent on overwhelming and conquering her southern neighbour. But
America in Vietnam fought halfheartedly. America in Vietnam resorted to
unethical and inhumane techniques of battle. At home, leaders failed to
secure political authority; her system of conscription fell with corrupt
disproportion on the poor, the black, and the marginalised. Where is
South Vietnam today? Fifty thousand Americans also died for nothing.
Now, it seems, our rulers -- with the consistency of the vain and the
irrational -- wish to commit Britain and the West to further adventures
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this they are stupid and wrong.
The United Nations in the Balkans has proved but a useless umpire
between equally repellent and vicious factions. In four years the UN has
achieved nothing, save to expend young life and confer legitimacy on
evil causes and depraved despots. Peace cannot be won in the Balkans
bear pit. So Western war should not be fought. Let our governors, then,
be humiliated; but insist that they withdraw every last British soldier,
and preserve every last young life.

THE rising tide of Scottish nationalism finds an echo this week in
none other than Her Majesty's Stationery Office. The lead item offered
for sale in the all-new, profit-making HMSO catalogue is copies of the
Declaration of Arbroath. The declaration, they tell us, is ''the best
known and most treasured document in the national archives of Scotland.
A letter from the earls and barons of Scotland to the Pope, it is an
eloquent and polished statement of Scotland's independent status and
support for Robert I, whose victory at Bannockburn six years earlier had
not ended England's aggression towards Scotland . . .
''The declaration is an outstanding example of medieval Latin prose
and its language and rhythm build steadily to a climax in the quotation
from the Roman historian Sallust which still speaks to Scots across the
centuries.''
For those not up to speed with their Sallust, the HMSO provides the
quote: ''It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we
are fighting, but for freedom -- for that alone, which no honest man
gives up but with life itself.''
The declaration in poster form, complete with four-page booklet and
full translation, is available from HMSO at #4.95. All profits to the
Tory Government which refuses to contemplate Scots independence in any
shape or form.
Conflict of
interests
AFTER all the VE-Day celebrations we have to work out appropriate ways
to mark the 50th anniversary of victory against Japan when the Second
World War actually ended.
Now, as then, our chaps who fought in the Far East are the Forgotten
Army. It would not be right that the efforts of the men and women who
fought there should be seen as any less valuable than those who defeated
Hitler.
Obviously, organisations such as the Burma Star Association, which
represents the Servicemen and women who actually went through the
ordeal, should be consulted as to exactly how they wish to see the date
commemorated.
Glasgow has made some moves to stage events to mark VJ-Day. There are
tentative plans to have a populist entertainments and arts-based
festival to celebrate the anniversary of the end of hostilities.
One slight complication is that CND already has a provisional booking
for George Square to mark the anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki
atom bombs and the advent of nuclear holocaust on the world scene.
Rolls and
regulations
THE etiquette of our golf clubs never fails to amaze and amuse. The
extremely posh Glasgow Golf Club at Killermont extends its rigorous
rules to the dirty bar, usually a haven for lawless and casually dressed
members of golfing fraternities.
We hear that Killermont goes so far as to reprimand members who try to
use the dirty bar when they are too well-dressed. And they have struck a
blow for decent standards of behaviour everywhere by decreeing that
sandwiches may not be consumed while golfers are having a pint in the
dirty bar. Sweets are, however, permitted.
The Name Game
A RECENT correspondent from West Byfleet, Surrey, to the letters page
of an English Sunday newspaper rejoiced in the name Godfrey Heaven.
Which brings back memories of aged Glasgow relatives exclaiming: ''Good
God Frae Heaven!'' We wonder if Godfrey is aware of his fame in these
parts.
More Names
NO LESS an icon than Rikki Fulton points out the cognomen of a French
secret service agent mentioned on our foreign pages last Saturday. He is
a M Alain Mafart. No doubt one of the silent but deadly school of secret
agents.
Even more names
STUART GILLAN and Ian McKim of Langside, Glasgow, tell us -- and who
are we to doubt -- that they have discovered in a specialist magazine a
CD-ROM called Interactive Homosexual Relationships by Michael
Fitzpatrick and Patrick Fitzmichael.
Capital
punishment?
ANOTHER great heading from the Buteman: ''Academy pupils to hang in
capital''. Unfortunately not a case of a return to punishments even more
severe than the tawse, merely news that three pupils of Rothesay Academy
are to have prize-winning drawings exhibited in Edinburgh during the
Festival.
One too many
WE return to the recent subject of tales of inebriation, human traits,
and behaviour which reveal that more drink has been taken than is
perhaps wise. Jim Burke of Clarkston offers this tale of a friend called
John who was courting a young lady from Lancashire.
The time had come for John to go south to meet the prospective
parents-in-law. He found them to be awfy nice people and it did appear
that they were not entirely against the concept of him as a possible
son-in-law.
Until he sloped off to the local pub where he, purely as a reaction to
the stresses and strains of the familial encounter, proceeded to get
blootered. So there he was, sleeping in the spare room, when he was
wakened in the night by the call of nature.
Somewhat ill-advisedly, he made his way to the toilet, wearing nothing
but a T-shirt. He got lost, of course, and found himself, in Chaucerian
fashion, in the master bedroom occupied by prospective parents-in-law.
The parents had been sleeping but were stirred by the noise of a 6ft
2ins and (there are no other words to describe this) hairy-arsed chap
blundering about their bedroom. John then found what he thought he was
looking for. Actually he had lifted the lid of the laundry basket and
relieved himself.
He then crawled into the parents' bed and snuggled up to his
girlfriend's mother.
You may be surprised to hear that the nuptials did not go ahead.

IN one of the stylish little lingerie shops in Bellagio a businessman
is buying three pairs of stockings for a lady. He knows precisely the
size and denier required and has chosen the designs with a connoisseur's
authority -- one pair in translucent ivory encircled with lace garters,
the second, fishnets in chestnut brown, and finally some sheer
stockings, ebony in colour with an arabesque running the length of the
leg. If this were not Saturday one might suppose that the businessman's
gift was for his mistress. But in this pretty town beside Lake Como, the
weekend, like every Italian weekend, is the exclusive province of the
family. It is unlikely the businessman is buying such hosiery for his
mother, so he must be buying it for his wife.
But in a sense the identity of the recipient is irrelevant. What
impresses the visiting onlooker is that this man shows no inhibition
about his task. Nearby, others, accompanied by their spouses, are
assiduously selecting camisoles and camiknickers while debating the
merits of blush-pink satin against this season's silver grey. These
cameos of conjugal shopping are unimaginable at home, and yet in Italy,
where they say the men run the country and the women run the men,
perhaps it cannot be otherwise. Here, in the shop, every female present
is subtly, smilingly, gracefully coaxing a man into paying for exactly
what she wants.
On the handsome face of it, then, Italy proceeds as status-consciously
as ever. Up and down the Corso Vittorio Emanuele in practically every
noted town men and women of all ages stroll past shop windows, gazing at
merchandise with the informed intensity of people born to elegant
expectations. Beneath the surface, however, there is much in turmoil.
The pursuit of those who, over generations, have corrupted politics and
the economy is unravelling every aspect of Italian life. The Mafia, at
last significantly under threat, still manages to accomplish murder with
ferocious skill and precision. And, increasingly, that indulgent, even
cunning, acceptance of chauvinism is wearing thin: women themselves are
now demanding a noisy public voice, marching against shameful
indifference to rape and the woeful lack of sanctuaries for the
battered. A man may continue to pretend that he is the boss of creation
in Italy, but today in his unsettled heart he knows that Numero Uno is
just one more damned statistic.
SOMEONE once remarked to an American friend, Natalia in Milan, how
wonderful it must be to marry a man of a different nationality. Like
taking a foreign holiday, they said, and 20 years ago Natalia agreed.
But in the seventies, when she first arrived in Italy as a bride from
New York, that intoxicating feeling of being on vacation lasted no
longer than it took to unpack the luggage. Natalia, with her purposeful
Manhattan stride, her business suits, her cry for affirmative action,
discovered she was in exile. She had married a professor and was moving
in cultivated circles but she was an imperiously mocked figure all the
same, a troublemaker seeking equal terms in a country run as a men's
club.
Even now, she says wearily, many men, especially in the south, regard
Italian women in sacrificial categories -- virgin, mamma, whore. ''In
the beginning I protested, but I, too, learned to keep my mouth shut.''
Then, as she met other women determined not to live with that same
diminishing, secret anger of their mothers, Natalia knew she was right
to complain as loudly as she could. Today the more spirited and open
quality of her daughter's life is proof that Italian women finally have
the excessively nourished male ego on the run. But it is also true that,
like almost every outsider, Natalia has come to love Italy profoundly,
despite its vexing paradoxes.
She is still married to her professor yet even he, after so many
years, cannot fully appreciate the interior problems of those who cut
themselves off from where they began. Natalia, the child of a Parisian
mother and an Egyptian father who raised his family in a brownstone on
Fifth Avenue, says: ''When I hear my husband telling me Italians are the
masters of culture I want to explode. I would rather the restlessness of
mixed blood, the uncertainty of never knowing where one really wants to
be, than the parochialism of belonging to one nation only.''
Has it ever crossed her husband's mind that marrying a non-Italian
might be like taking a foreign holiday? Natalia doubts it. ''He just
presumed I would become like him.'' And, in a way, she has been
caressing the sting of that discovery for two decades. But maybe
relationships are like that the world over. After all, she has only to
read the fuming air-mail letters she receives from all those old
girlfriends in New York . . .

Eric Kennedy meets a man whose soaring ambition lifted him into the
upper echelons.
THERE are not many jobs where you can find yourself flying alongside a
golden eagle, but George Muir has one of them. He pilots a helicopter
for a living and is best known as Captain George of Radio Clyde traffic
patrol fame.
''The radio broadcasts are fun but a small part of what I do,'' he
says. ''I am involved in tours and a great deal of corporate work.''
George Muir decided some time ago that he wanted to fly helicopters on
a commercial basis. This is easier said than done: it costs tens of
thousands of pounds to train for a commercial pilot's licence, as
opposed to a private one.
A commercial licence holder can ply for hire, whereas a private
licence holder must fly only small aircraft, taking no payment.
A private licence costs between #4000 and #6000 to obtain, and the
holder can attempt to have it converted to a commercial one by proving
he has at least 450 flying hours' experience, covering the various
aspects of flying such as cross-country and night flying, and taking
written and practical exams.
Even after getting a commercial licence, life is not that easy: the
person is categorised as a low-time helicopter pilot, difficult to
employ, largely because of insurance difficulties. You need
determination to make a go of this particular profession.
Where there is a will, of course, there is a way. George Muir and his
wife decided in the late 1970s that this was the job for him, and they
sold everything and moved to the US, where commercial pilot tuition was
not so prohibitively expensive as in Britain.
He learned to fly in Los Angeles, then they moved to Canada, and back
to America again. This process lasted three years, and during this time
he amassed enough flying hours to allow him to return to Britain, sit
the appropriate tests, and gain his commercial licence. He is now
authorised to fly in three countries Britain, Canada, and America.
In 1984 he took a job flying for a Glasgow-based company, and two
years later he and a colleague, Joe McGachy, set up Clyde Helicopters at
Glasgow Airport, moving to their own Clyde Heliport next to the SECC in
1988. George and Joe are shareholders with others, including Radio Clyde
and Scottish Enterprise.
The radio station invited Clyde Helicopters to take over its
traffic-patrol broadcasts, which have developed from a morning-only
service to a twice-daily feature.
It is hugely successful, and among its awards was the 1986 Gold Medal
at the International Radio Festival of New York for the best airborne
traffic service in the world. This is the Oscar of the airwaves.
Meanwhile George Muir is heavily occupied, flying oil executives over
the sites of pipelines to ensure that they are undisturbed, taking
photographers on special projects, flying tourists over Loch Lomond, and
whirling over the Highlands.
It was while flying over Knoydart that he found himself alongside the
golden eagle. ''I slowed down and it just turned and looked at me,'' he
says. ''It was one of the most memorable of my flying experiences.''
For a man who has covered about 720,000 air miles in his time, that is
saying something. As he says himself, a helicopter pilot sees things
from a privileged position.

Geraldine Abrahams reports on one man keen on projecting a good image
all round the country.
WHEN Drew Goodwin was a young boy growing up in Lanarkshire he had a
fascination for the cinema. By the time he was 13, he was already
involved with the local picture house, cleaning out the projection box
and running up to a neighbouring cinema with the Pathe Newsreels.
When he left school, the local cinemas had all closed, so he decided
on a career in engineering, continuing his first love on a part-time
basis in the evenings.
He then left engineering and worked as a food salesman for 10 years,
before going back to the revived cinema industry as a projectionist at
the multiplex cinema at East Kilbride.
The equipment there was state of the art, and he was well trained in
its use. He also helped set up shows at East Kilbride Arts Centre.
At the same time, he had read various trade journals and recognised a
gap in the cinema marketplace. The rural areas were not being served,
although there was obvious demand.
He carried out his own market survey simultaneously with the Scottish
Arts Council and the Scottish Film Council, and the research confirmed
his theory.
The only option for people in more remote parts of the country were
city multiplexes, which were costly in terms of time and travel.
With the Scottish Civic Entertainment Association meeting regularly at
the East Kilbride Arts Centre, he saw an opportunity to make the members
from all over Scotland aware of the potential for a cinema service for
remote areas.
Drew began to plan his new enterprise: Filmobile, a modern, mobile
film unit that would offer the best quality films with the highest
professional presentation at value-for-money prices.
A business start-up course at Glasgow Caledonian University, an #800
Boost For Business Start-Up grant from Motherwell District Council, and
an initial loan of equipment from the Scottish Film Council, have all
contributed to Filmobile getting off the ground.
One year on from when he first mooted his ideas, Drew Goodwin is
proving that his perception of the market was right.
''In the early 60s, suburban cinemas closed down and were turned into
bingo halls, and the cinema industry looked dead until the multiplexes
revived it,'' he explained. ''We are following through the natural
progression. We have gone to the rural areas and given people the same
chance as those in the city to go and see a show of their choice, and
the success of that has been borne out by the crowds that have come.''
Drew's first contract has been with Moray District Council. Arts and
entertainments officer Eric McGillivary, a member of the Arts Committee,
invited Drew to go up to Moray and look round the halls that he had
earmarked. After working out some technical details, they agreed a
contract, and Filmobile will be showing films every fortnight in Moray
until Christmas.
Moray District Council has been delighted at the response. Eric
McGillivary said: ''This has generated a lot of excitement amongst the
young people and there has been a lot of enthusiasm from the community
councils too. People have told their friends, and like most things, word
of mouth has been the best advertisement.
''For young mothers, it has meant getting babysitters for only two
hours instead of five, and there is not the problem of buses not running
late. It is a very cost-effective service.''
Another contract has been signed with Wigton District Council for
films at Stranraer on alternate weeks.
Drew Goodwin explains the thinking behind Filmobile's slogan: Bringing
the Magic of the Movies to You.
''This goes back 60 or 70 years when they used to travel up to the
Highlands in an old rickety van and crank out silent films in draughty
halls.
''We are bringing modern expertise and quality films back to the same
locations, and a bit of glamour and excitement into these communities
that have been starved of entertainment and limited in their options.''
The size of the screen will depend on the format of the film. For
cinemascope, it can be expanded to 30ft by 15ft -- as big as any
commercial cinema, which has caused some amazement in local halls, with
their two or three hundred seats.
Other councils in Scotland, like Motherwell and Cunninghame, are
showing interest, and as awareness of the service grows, Drew Goodwin
intends to expand, taking on and training staff.
Motherwell district, for example, has a static cinema built into its
complex but has been making enquiries about taking film shows to some of
its cultural centres in Shotts and Bellshill.
Said Drew: ''I want our customers to sit down and get away from all
their worries for a couple of hours and enjoy the cinema, which is a
form of escapism as well as entertainment. After the performances, when
the film has ended and the credits start to roll, the audiences applaud.
That is really nice, that human response.''

Pupils are being taught how to cope with emergencies in the safety of
a training area reports Dick Louden.
COPING with emergencies is something that children can't learn about
too soon, and one of the most valuable ways of teaching them is the ELK
(Experimential Learning Kyle and Carrick) project.
For four weeks each year it takes pupils aged 10 to 12 through a
number of lifelike emergency situations.
Organised by Safe North Ayr, a community body run by Kyle and Carrick
District Council, Strathclyde region and the Scottish Office, ELK has
eight sets in Dam Park Stadium, Ayr, designed to reflect real life
situations and to equip children to tackle emergencies.
''This site at Dam Park is the first permanent one of its kind in
Scotland,'' said event manager James Gemmell, ''and we have had generous
support and sponsorship.''
St John's Primary in Ayr sent along its 27 primary seven pupils on a
cold, blustery afternoon. They divided into groups of three or four to
tackle their eight emergencies.
One group, consisting of Nadia Coia, Laura Andrew and Ryan Wade, began
began by watching simulation of a middle-aged lady having her handbag
stolen by a teenager.
Along came PC Alistair Fulton, who said they should not chase after
the thief because he would be bigger and stronger and might be carrying
a knife.
One of their priorities should be to realise the shock the victim had
suffered, and to persuade her to sit down and compose herself.
The next set was the smoke-filled room. Community firefighters Tom
Stewart and Tony Barr explained that they must ''get out, get the fire
brigade out and stay out''.
The idea was to crawl under the smoke, feel their way along the wall
till they came to a door, and run the back of their hand up the door to
check the heat behind it. If it was too hot, they were to crawl in
search of a window, open it and shout for help.
Then it was into the kitchen, where Nadia, Laura, and Ryan proved
adept at pointing out the various hazards -- tape carelessly wound round
the kettle lead, clothes hanging above the frying-pan, bleach stored in
a lemonade bottle, pills left lying in a sweet dish, and many others.
The youngsters had to deal next with a human casualty. Ambulance
paramedic Maitland Hunter showed them how to check the heartbeat and the
pulse, and how to turn the casualty on his side to avoid him choking.
At the next set was the inevitable stranger, played by Alex Kelly,
chairman of the Carrick Crime Prevention Panel. He was standing on the
slope of a riverbank and his dog, he claimed, had become stranded under
a bridge. He held up a dog lead as proof. Wisely, the children refused
to become involved.
On the road safety set, could Nadia, Laura and Ryan estimate a car's
stopping distance in an emergency? Needless to say, they all
underestimated it. They were more successful in identifying the factors
affecting the stopping distance -- water or ice on the road, leaves on
the ground in autumn, the condition of the car, the condition of the
driver.
ScottishPower's electrical substation had its gate and door standing
open and a five-pound note lying on the ground. It failed to entice the
children. They knew not to use a stick to reach out for the fiver
(''Electricity can travel'').
The procedure is to note the substation's number and look for a
telephone. They were also warned of the dangers of playing with a ball,
kite, or fishing-rod near telephone lines.
The last simulation was the drowning man. A brave volunteer, Andy
Reid, was immersed in the river, clinging to his upturned canoe. The
children knew they must call the coastguard service.
The first phone they found was damaged -- a reminder to them of the
potential consequences of vandalism. They were warned not to enter the
water -- the drowning man would be physically stronger and, in his
panic, could pull them under.
Safe North Ayr depends a lot on volunteers like Andy Reid. Some of
them offer their services for the whole four weeks of the ELK project.
This is the very best kind of community project, with all the agencies
coming together in a common understanding that they are offering a
valuable service to children.
The pupils themselves appreciated the direct relevance of the tests
they had undergone. As Ryan Wade said: ''I didn't even know if there
really was a dog under the bridge or not.'' Laura Andrew was confident
that she would remember most of what she had been taught. ''The casualty
was a really good one,'' she said. ''I really hadn't a clue about that
before.''
Nadia Coia vindicated the approach taken by Safe North Ayr. ''What was
good was that we weren't told beforehand what we should do. We were left
to think and make our own decisions.''

Edinburgh University academic Dr Gari Don reports on apartheid's
legacy in South African schools -- a yawning gulf between black and
white -- and recent efforts to reduce gross overcrowding and contentious
curricula
SOUTH Africa's 11,000,000 children have just begun the second term of
schooling in a post-apartheid society. But can blatant inequalities and
obvious contradictions ever be reduced, let alone eradicated? And can
education compensate for society's horrendous apartheid policies?
Two crucial policy concerns have been admissions to schools and class
size. For Jean Mapungu, Principal of Umnqophiso School in the Lwandle
township, near Cape Town, the issue of whether class sizes will be 35 or
40:1 is academic. For her, average pupil/teacher ratios are 75:1. With a
primary school of 550 in classes from 7.15am until 12.15pm and a
secondary school of 850 children, beginning at 12.30pm and continuing
until 5.30pm each day, such concerns are laughable.
And indeed she does laugh. Amazingly for a principal of a school built
three years ago for 400 primary pupils now used by 1400 children aged
six to 20, she does not condemn the iniquitous system: rather, she
pushes for what she now feels might be possible -- another two teachers
from April, please. She has no library, science equipment, sports
fields, and until three years ago her school buildings were four sea
containers. Even then, there were children who managed to move onto
higher education at a ''historically black university''.
Now, after four years in the post, Jean Mapungu is aiming to have 100%
pass rates and hopes her school will come top of the league tables. But
with an impoverished parent community and a paltry school fund she has
only about #150 in the bank for the year. That is to buy all the paper,
pens, crayons, wall-charts -- ''but not the chalk, the department
provides that,'' she explained.
With the Group Areas Act and a road transport policy designed to
create chasms between communities, it is not surprising that one
community has little knowledge of education provision in others.
Moving from Lwandle township, where shacks assembled from discarded
wood, plywood and rubbish seem, miraculously, to stay upright, I walked
a few hundred yards across the motorway and visited an educational
establishment of unquestioned privilege. The entrance hall sported
leather couches, the walls were covered with shelves bearing silver cups
for sporting events. The Principal of Hottentots Holland Secondary,
Steve Roux, is a charming man who speaks of Scotland with great
affection -- his boys played rugby at Loretto recently.
He spoke of the problem of increasing his 1:20 teacher/pupil ratio to
1:25 or even 1:35. ''This would mean white teachers from our school
being retrenched to schools where there is a need -- to African schools
in the townships. This will be a great problem for the teachers, most of
whom have never been into a township.'' He would rather have his
teachers and facilities being used by township pupils. He felt certain
that the parent governing body of his school would agree to this option:
rather that than lose teachers.
Schools like Hottentot Holland have traditionally accounted for 93% of
formerly white schools and have been seen by parents as extremely
successful. Parents have not been required to pay salary costs of
teachers at these schools but have had to pay for all books, equipment
and clothing. This is no mean sum. The cost of uniform and bags is
immense.
Mary Metcalfe, the minister of education for Gauteng, says she will
not allow head teachers to expel pupils who are unable to pay for
equipment costs. Instead the school can sue errant parents. But as a
parent of daughters who went to a Cape Town school similar to Hottentot
Holland, I wonder how that policy can possibly be upheld, just and fair
though it obviously is.
What is taught in schools may prove to be the most contentious
problem. Until January 1995 there had been separate curricula, each
being administered by a department responsible for that race's
education. There were 19 departments. The small-minded iniquities were
immense: no music or art in the syllabus of the Department of Education
and Training (DET) for black school children. Instead there were
''techniques and skills'' classes with beads and fabric squares to glue
and manoeuvre.
During my stay, the National Ministry distributed interim syllabi for
all 18 subjects to all provinces. Jean Septembre of the South African
Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) is looking with interest at Scotland's
recent 5-14 programme and, in particular, at the role of teachers
seconded to development groups. It has been said that the support of
such teachers was of crucial importance in the successful implementation
of the programme. Such support is absolutely essential for education in
the new South Africa.
Everywhere there are contradictions. I visited the Matthew Goniway
Memorial High School in Kyletchiwa, named after a charismatic principal
who, in his attempt to support school children in their resistance
struggles, had been ''snatched from his car, knifed, and set on fire by
the South African Police. Not such an unusual happening in the 80s,''
said Monde Mbekwa, the current principal.
The school, built for 800, has 1400 children. Class sizes of 60 are
the norm. ''We have 170 this year doing standard 10 matriculation --
they are divided into two classes.'' The children arrive from the local
townships bright-eyed, well-dressed, and enthusiastic. Their commitment
to schooling is obvious. Like the Lwandle township children, they see
education as their right and as their passport to a better life.
But while white schools have budgets, ex-DET schools like Mbekwa's
must survive (for the time being at any rate) through parental
contributions to the school fund. But in the post-apartheid climate of
''free education for all'' many parents are unable or unwilling to pay.
His school survives on about #9000 a year but as there is no budget
allocation he has no idea about funding teacher upgrading programmes.
When the interim syllabi enter his school, and new subjects (music and
art in particular and new approaches to history) have to be taught, he
will do his best to move existing teachers around the school. But it is
such a complex task: he would have liked help and advice.
The reconstruction and development programme of the ANC talks about
the importance of education as the basis of emerging social justice,
equity, and equality of opportunity. But to teachers with more children
than ever in their classrooms, and with the threat of retrenchment
ever-present, parents watching their children walk up the same
over-grown and still-segregated school paths see many hurdles on the
road to an egalitarian future.

REX Hall is satisfied that few of his colleagues in neighbouring local
authorities know precisely how he goes about his job. And he is happy
not to let them in on the secret.
His reticence has little to do with embarrassment over bringing a
Burger King Academy to his education authority, Tower Hamlets, one of
the most deprived in London.
Far from it. He is an enthusiastic broker of advantageous partnerships
with industry and has helped to bring in up to #1.5m a year in cash and
kind to the borough.
His reluctance to reveal his methods is rather more businesslike. Put
simply, the longer rivals take to copy his approaches to private and
public companies, the more successful he is likely to be.
There isn't a bottomless crock of gold at the end of the private
finance rainbow -- although the Government would apparently like us to
think there are reserves of cash -- and soon competition for what is
there will intensify.
Tower Hamlets' 35,000 pupils reflect the challenges facing the poor
East End borough, where 65% of children are entitled to free school
meals and 60% come from homes where a language other than English is
spoken.
Although it does not believe in the Government's exam league tables,
the authority has launched an initiative to raise standards in schools
by brokering deals with more than 160 sponsors, many of them household
names and revered institutions such as Brooke Bond, the Post Office,
Lloyd's of London and Burger King.
It is easy to scoff at Burger King Academies . . . and they were
greeted with much derision when they were imported to Britain from the
home of consumer culture, the USA.
Their very name conjures up cartoon images: drive-in lessons, pupils
munching double cheeseburgers with fries during intervals, teachers
saying ''Have a nice day'' at the end of a double maths period.
But they were criticised on a more down-to-earth level as well. Burger
King paid #50,000 towards refurbishing an old building to turn it into a
unit for children who had a history of truancy. It then contributed
#10,000 a year towards the running costs.
The unit can only cater for two classes of about 12 pupils at any one
time -- a ''drop in the ocean'' according to one leading director of
education in England. But will business ever contribute to all
children's education?
The Government's attempts so far at persuading captains of industry to
foot education bills have had limited success. The flagships of
entrepreneurial schooling, the city technology colleges (CTCs), have
sailed forth but on a modest course. And none exist in Scotland.
Baroness Thatcher hoped at first to launch 20 CTCs, with each
attracting #8-#10m from private sponsors. To date there are only 15,
with just #37m worth of private funds between them. The Department for
Education is now promoting a fleet of smaller craft -- technology
colleges. They have to find only #100,000 from private sources each in
order to get extra government grants.
Parents, too, are not all enthusiastic. Patti Rundall, of Parents
Opposed to Opting Out, suspects the motives of firms offering to help
benighted educational institutions. In particular, she objects to the
new technology colleges having sponsor governors on their boards. She
said: ''They're using schools for marketing and I object to that.''
Back at Tower Hamlets, Mr Hall said Burger King got millions of pounds
of free advertising from the national television and newspaper reports
of the Burger King Academy opening. He has no problems with that, nor
with the firm showing their top American executives round the school.
But if a bank wanted to sponsor 10 teachers, or the firm wanted to
photograph every pupil scoffing a burger, the authority would refuse.
Tower Hamlets' latest coup is a #100,000 plus deal with an American
bank, the Bankers Trust, to help one 800-pupil mixed comprehensive. The
money will be spread over 10 years and will provide a homework club and
transform the library into a computerised learning centre. The offer
fits Mr Hall's experience that companies do not want to fund core
activities, such as teachers.
And Martin Rogers, of the Local Schools Information Service, said:
''There's no evidence I'm aware of that lots of businesses want to put
large sums of money into local schools. One reason is that businessmen
feel that's the Government's job.''
But the Government has not given up on its drive to change the
financial culture of education. There is a spirit of partnership abroad
in England. It is spreading quietly, with non-elected boards spending
public and private money to provide a variety of services. Many ordinary
people have barely noticed them yet.
Take a recent scrabble for public cash to fit spy cameras in town
centres. The Government made it into a competition for partnerships. One
Midlands county town received #70,000. Another nearby, with a higher
crime rate, got nothing. Guess which one had a proper partnership, with
pledges of cash from local businesses and a church rector as its
chairman?
Similar bodies are being set up to map out the economic development of
certain areas, and to clean up the environment. When will similar drives
reach mainstream education?
Mr Hall said Tower Hamlets was already feeling such pressure from the
Government. ''I'm sure some of our bids for government money have been
enhanced because we can bring forward projects with private sector
companies. I'm sure having names like GrandMet, Lehman Brothers and
Lloyds as partners does help.''
The writing is on the blackboard. In the foreword to a glossy
Department of Education brochure, Education Means Business, Howard
Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, says:
''We have seen an appetite in the private sector to invest in other
elements of the nation's infrastructure with the full encouragement of
government.
''The time has now come to see what progress can be made in
education.''

Engaging talents are to the fore of today's business practise as
Barbara Mackenzie reports.
THE TSB PhoneBank service, due to begin operating later this year with
an anticipated 1000 new full and part-time jobs, began its recruitment
process last week. And the recruits have emerged from a major training
programme of access courses begun by the Glasgow Development Agency
(GDA) two months ago.
This has ensured that a pool of appropriately skilled people will be
readily available for the new TSB call centre in the city's Atlantic
Quay development.
In conjunction with several training providers the GDA set up
customised access courses, at no cost to the trainees, specifically
designed to help applicants upgrade and redefine their skills and
compete for employment within the growing call centre market.
The 1000 hoped for jobs at Atlantic Quay will come on stream over the
next year or so.
Staff will be required at all levels of the highly sophisticated
centralised operation to deal with registered customers wanting to
conduct their banking arrangements by phone such as checking balances,
transferring funds, paying bills, and cancelling direct debits.
These will include telemarketing advisors, telemarketing supervisors,
PhoneBank advisors and PhoneBank supervisors.
One of the training providers is Heatwise, which is based in Charlotte
Street. It is running three eight-week courses simultaneously with an
average of 10 people on each.
Its first group of nine trainees will finish one course this week.
Five of them passed a telephone interview with TSB a week ago (May 22)
and will go forward to the next stage of the recruitment process, a
short assessment on numerical proficiency. The third stage is a
face-to-face interview and the final stage is a workshop covering
various aspects of the job.
To be eligible for the courses, applicants have to be over 18, and
must fall into any one of a number of categories. These include having
been registered unemployed for six months or more, having a disability,
being a returner to the labour market after a minimum break of two years
or being involved in what the GDA have assessed as a large scale
redundancy.
A TSB spokesman said: ''We are looking for people who are good team
players, have a positive approach to customer service, and a pleasant
telephone manner.''
Those trainees who fall at the first hurdle, however, can still look
positively at the job market because they skills they acquire on the
training programme will have increased their potential for other
employment.
Stressing the transferable nature of the skills within the training
programme, Mr Paul Hunter, one of the four tutors on the Heatwise course
said: ''As well as those skills geared to competing for jobs within a
call-centre environment like telephone and keyboard skills,
communication and numerical skills, and customer service and care, they
have also been given training in confidence building, assertiveness and
social and interpersonal skills.
''They can also use the facilities available here to look for work.''
He explained that the trainees came from fairly diverse backgrounds
adding: ''We believe it is our job to tease out and enhance their
existing skills as well as giving them new ones.''
Mr Hunter continued saying that because of the large number of women
returners and that fact that Heatwise offered training in the evenings
which suited people with young families, about three-quarters of the
trainees were female.
One success story is 22-year-old Helen Blyth. She was attracted to the
training course by the prospect of a job with the TSB and has, in fact,
ended up being employed by Heatwise as an administrative assistant.
She said: ''The course gave me useful skills, made me sit up and think
about things and made me feel much more confident. It has definitely
been worth it, especially now I have a job.''
Ms Denise Kerins, the GDA executive responsible for the access
courses: ''With projects on the scale of the TSB development coming to
Glasgow and the substantial growth in the call centre sector in the city
as a whole, the GDA decided to take steps to ensure that even more
people would be able to take advantage of the many opportunities
generated by the city's success in attracting firms here. So we
developed the access courses.''
She also emphasised the transferable nature of the skills learned and
added: ''It is crucial that we equip people who have been long-term
unemployed with the skills necessary to compete, not only for the jobs
created by the TSB, but for jobs throughout the wider call centre
sector. By doing this, we will hopefully help them make the transition
into permanent employment.''
TSB has said the new business would be officially opened in September
but would be up and running by August giving Scotland its first 24-hour,
365 days a year telephone banking service, fully integrated with an
existing bank branch network.
A similar call centre was opened by TSB in Newport, South Wales, last
October following a successful small pilot scheme covering Gateshead, on
Tyneside, 18 months earlier.

CAN I pin down one particular nonsense about the Perth and Kinross
by-election before it becomes a legend? There was no ''hype, spin, and
hubris put on at the insistence of Mr Tony Blair's office'' (Robbie
Dinwoodie, May 27). The strategy for the by-election was created and
driven in Scotland and it was endorsed and supported by the national
leadership.
Labour had to fight hard in this territory. At the last election we
were a distant third with only 12.5% of the poll. However, with Labour
as the only alternative government and with Perth and Kinross surrounded
by marginal seats we had to have a high-profile campaign to get our
message over and to avoid being squeezed tactically as we were in
Kincardine and Deeside.
OK, we were ambitious in going for gold but you don't succeed by
aiming for second place. Had the unpopularity of the Government not been
so great and the tactical voting instinct so strong we might have made
it but the result, as many independent experts have pointed out, was a
real breakthrough for Labour.
Labour came from 12.5% and doubled our share of the vote. We added
3400 new voters on a reduced poll, with the SNP victors getting 1000
fewer votes in spite of their ''hype and spin''. Labour's previous best
post-war by-election coming from third was in Eastleigh last year and
they added 7% to the poll share. We got 10.5%.
The SNP strategists now know they have seriously to worry. They
dropped votes and they were 15% short of the 55% predicted by the last
poll. They increased their share by only 4% and that swing would not get
them near any Labour seats. In addition they know that of the 40% of
voters who supported them more than half reject independence and that
the favoured option of all voters including half of SNP voters is
devolution.
The Nationalists must face the bleak fact that in mid-1995 they have
today not a single councillor in Scotland's capital city and only five
in the four other cities. In local government and in parliamentary seats
they have been marginalised south of the Tay.
The prophetic words in February from SNP executive member Iain Lawson
about his leadership have come to haunt them: ''They appear blind to the
fact that you cannot win independence on the back of disillusioned Tory
voters. That strategy may help to win a few seats north of the Tay but
it will never deliver the wedge of Labour seats in urban Scotland that
we require for our independence mandate.''

House of Commons.

NO doubt there will now be a concerted effort to paint the Perth
results as a Labour triumph and certainly they did very well (though how
much of this was due to the dishonest proposition of a likely Labour
victory being sold to some of the electorate I cannot judge), but this
contrasts starkly with the overwhelming sentiment which sought to
portray last year a much more spectacular SNP advance in Monklands East
as an SNP failure.
At the next General Election, of course, out of the white hot heat of
a by-election campaign, the Labour vote in Perth will drop back to its
natural position of distant third place.
It was a bit presumptive, however, on the part of the Labour Party to
try to win in Perth this time merely by having some of the press repeat
continuously how good their candidate was and what a fine future he had.
Douglas Alexander was an adequate candidate but, in the final
analysis, he is likely to be the most serious casualty of the ridiculous
overstatement of his abilities and chances of winning.
Much was made on election night of the significance of the Labour vote
with regards to likely Labour victories at the next General Election in
the Ayr, Stirling, and Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber constituencies.
It would be a huge shock certainly if Labour failed to gain Ayr and
Stirling in the present climate, but I see nothing in the Perth result,
or in the results of the recent council elections, to suggest that
Labour is significantly better placed than the Liberals or the SNP to
win the Inverness seat, which is not presently held by the Tories.

NOW that the dust has settled on the Perth and Kinross by-election, it
is worth considering the word ''nationalist'' and its implications. To
the Conservatives it is anathema -- but only when it comes wrapped in a
Saltire.
Witness the blatant politicking practised by the Tories who wrapped
themselves in the Union Flag and attempted to capitalise on the VE-Day
flag-waving. Incidentally, why was the biggest VE-Day parade outside of
London held in the tiny town of Perth?
The Conservatives' disgraceful attempt to equate the Scottish National
Party (not the Scottish Nationalist Party) to the Nazis of the Second
World War was rightfully treated with contempt by the electorate.
Let us not forget this Tory nationalism. Is it quite acceptable to be
a British Nationalist but not a Scottish Nationalist? If anything can be
equated to nationalism it is the Union Flag, itself a symbol of
repression, exploitation, and by far away the worst type of nationalism,
that is, imperialism.
When expansionist nationalism uses force to impose itself on other
countries, yes, it is dangerous and evil, but let us not confuse the
imperialist monster with the Civic Nationalism of the SNP.
The Scottish National Party has a vision of a democractic Scotland,
freely elected, and representing Scots values. This is a far cry from
the ''politics of the Empire'' preached by the Union parties.
It is this Civic Nationalism which will win in the end. It is not
ethnic, exclusive, or discriminatory as clearly stated by Roseanna
Cunningham, MP, in her victory speech. Don't let us be fooled by
flag-waving.

THE article by the chief executive of the Scottish Tourist Board does
not fill me with confidence on the future of Scottish tourism (May 25).
Whilst not wishing to look a gift horse in the mouth I do not think we
should be depending on Rob Roys, Wallaces, and Dearhearts to carry us
through.
Such productions may indeed bring our scenic charms to the uninitiated
but let it be established that there are many, many places in the world
whose scenery equals and sometimes surpasses Scotland's.
What we need is an imaginative plan based on attractive prices across
the entire accommodation sector, myriad things to do, and facilities
that beat the weather.
And if this chief executive does not know where to start let him take
a look at Irish tourism where, even in the North before the ceasefire,
figures have been growing and continue to do so.

THERE is a figure in Viking art called the gripping beast. It is a
formidable serpent; curved, coiled, and convoluted into interlocking
whorls. Absurdly, its fierce jaws always emerge from the tangle to bite
its own tail. It is a perfect metaphor for the United Nations mission in
Bosnia. The responsibility for the self-inflicted wounds suffered by the
United Nations in former Yugoslavia, and for the abject failure of its
stated mission to keep the peace (which rarely existed) and its unstated
mission to compel a peace (impossible) can be shared widely. In recent
weeks the responsibility has narrowed. The immediate task is to define
the dilemma of the UN and to suggest, most emphatically, what should not
be done about it. The first part is easy enough, if disturbing: the
United Nations force in Bosnia cannot fight a war and it cannot keep the
peace. Logically, it should depart. It is likely that there would be
widespread support for this option in many of the countries which have
supplied the hapless peacekeepers. British public opinion is unlikely to
wish to sacrifice soldiers on the old altar of Balkan passions, and the
recent actions and comments of the French Government indicate the
likelihood that French public opinion would take a similar line.
Unfortunately, public opinion would be wrong. There are compelling
reasons why withdrawal of the United Nations would be a serious error,
and they range all the way from humanitarian concern to pure,
self-seeking pragmatism.
The military position of the combatants in Bosnia has been altering
perceptibly in recent months. As we point out in detail elsewhere in
this paper, the Bosnian Serbs have plentiful supplies of arms of all
sorts but are short of manpower. The Bosnian Government cannot match
Serbian arms but has plenty of soldiers. The nature of the war means
that slowly but surely the balance of advantage is tipping towards the
Bosnian Government as its large army stretches the thin but heavily
armed Serb lines to breaking point. Withdrawal of the United Nations
would almost certainly lead to a dropping of the arms embargo by the
United States. This would eventually aid the Bosnian Government, but the
immediate consequences for Bosnian civilians would be terrible. Serb
heavy artillery and mortars would destroy the so-called safe areas and
cities like Sarajevo would be pounded into dust. For humanitarian
reasons the United Nations, bewildered, demoralised, abused and
resentful as it is, must remain.
Withdrawal would have another consequence, more dreadful even than the
inevitable sufferings of the Bosnians. President Slobodan Milosevic of
rump Yugoslavia (or Serbia proper) is one of the men most responsible
for this appalling mess. Lately he has been polishing his halo by
refusing to help his fellow Serbs in Bosnia in return for an easing of
Western sanctions which he hopes will become full and permanent. This
man commands the moral heights of a New Zealand flatworm. To trust him
is as wise as playing Russian roulette and twice as dangerous, but his
status as a source of potential pressure on the Bosnian Serbs means that
he is being courted assiduously by Mr Douglas Hurd and other European
Foreign Ministers. That is diplomacy, and it is not for those with
queasy stomachs. Nevertheless, withdrawal and the abandonment of the
arms embargo could change all of this. If the Bosnian Serbs found
themselves facing a well-armed as well as numerically superior Bosnian
Government army, President Milosevic might feel compelled to come to
their aid. The Russian Government, which is increasingly irritated by
its traditional Serb allies, could agree. Greece, which feverishly and
foolishly supports the Serbs, might also feel compelled, and this could
bring in Turkey on the side of the Bosnian Government. Thus we would
have widespread war in south-eastern Europe and the prospect of two Nato
allies (Greece and Turkey) squaring up to each other. It would be a
catastrophe of grotesque proportions, making a nasty mockery of any
scraps which yet persist of what was called the New World Order. It must
not be allowed to happen.
Early on in the sorry tale of United Nations involvement in former
Yugoslavia the blame for allowing the shambles to develop (and we use
''shambles'' in its original Old English sense) could be shared widely.
It is accepted that at an early point a robust intervention with the aim
of halting Serbian aggression in its tracks would probably have been
successful. That moment was lost in muddle and misdirection by all
concerned in the United Nations, saving the soldiers who were left with
the task of trying to carry out an impossible mission with inadequate
support. Although the desire to hit out at those who commit atrocities
is tempting (regrettably, not Serbs alone) it is clear that the only way
of putting a lid on the situation is through endless, persistent
negotiation with all parties. This message has escaped the Government of
the United States, and it has been forgotten by the Germans, who
persistently support the Croatians as part of their former (and future?)
sphere of interest.
The bombing raids which led to the hostage-taking were carried out at
the insistence of the US Government which is a strong supporter of the
Bosnian Government. There are suggestions that the US also refused to
allow withdrawal of UN observers from vulnerable positions before the
raids began. This is outrageous, coming as it does from a Government
with no troops on the ground and only the faintest appreciation of the
relevant complexities. If the situation escalates out of control the
greatest share of responsibility will lie with the Clinton
administration. Nor will there be a rush to join in any future UN
mission in which the United States has a controlling interest. The
position of the EU is little better. Next year the intergovernmental
conference will discuss a common foreign and security policy. As matters
stand, they really need not bother.
There is no pleasure to be had in all this negativism. Frankly, it is
distressing to review the involvement of the UN and the major nations in
former Yugoslavia. The best that can be done is to keep talking in the
hope that this might prevent fighting. The Contact Group proposals
should be advanced, and if this means flattering the appalling
Milosevic, so be it. The Bosnian Serbs should get only what the Contact
Group has already offered and not a whit more. Above all, we must do the
best we can to protect our troops while maintaining their role. As for
the future of UN operations, of European co-operation, and of
transatlantic relations, all must be addressed, but only after the
pressures and the depression engendered by the Bosnian fiasco have
lifted somewhat.

THERE'S nothing nicer of a morning than having your own prejudices
confirmed and your worst fears proved true. Thanks to The Herald this
has been such a morning (May 26).
The front-page news of the jailing of Big Dunc and John Godfrey's
humiliation at the hands of the good folk of Perth (Private Godfrey
would have stood a better chance) fair made my heart swell. The further
news on the ScotRail Fort William taxi fiasco and the venal avarice of
the director of Rolls Royce made me seethe, while Alf Young, on the
greed of privatised utility bosses, Julie Davidson, on Edinburgh's
traffic problems, and Jack McLean on Harold Wilson had me grinning,
nodding my head, and shouting hear hear.
The sun was shining and I whistled as I walked to work.

AS a frequent passenger on the excellent and undoubtedly popular rail
service operating between Paisley and Glasgow, known as the Canal Line,
I never fail to appreciate the wisdom and foresight of the powers that
be in taking the decision to reopen this stretch of line a couple of
years back.
It must surely be a matter of some regret to Strathclyde Passenger
Transport and British Rail that due to the establishment of a housing
development almost immediately beyond Paisley Canal Station it would be
no longer practicable to extend the service westwards to serve the
communities through to Kilmacolm -- communities which have grown
enormously since the line was abandoned in the early 1980s.
I am sure that had it been possible to reinstate this service in its
entirety along its original track, it would by now be enjoying a
considerable renaissance in terms of passenger usage, thus avoiding many
an unnecessary car journey into the bargain.

I READ with horror that BR is axing yet more services on the West
Highland line, and the Wick and Thurso line during the summer when the
tourist season is at its height.
To say that the cuts are disappointing, as the Scottish Tourist Board
has done, is the understatement of the year. If nothing is done, all
services north of Glagow and Edinburgh will be in danger.
Isn't it about time that all the Scottish MPs of whatever party and
every Scottish newspaper launched a campaign of resistance to these
appalling cuts?
People power has achieved much on many occasions. Surely this is a
cause worth fighting for?
Even if a stay of execution could be granted, at least until the
autumn, so that objections could be heard, that would be something, but
I fear that, as in so many cases, the railways of the north will be
killed by apathy.

LET us just call him Jack Nasty-Face, and thus spare the ghastly
oppressor the need publicly to acknowledge the grossness of his
deficiencies and iniquities . . . chance would be a fine thing. Jack is
a businessman at the cutting edge of retailing 90s-style -- or so he
claims -- and a right little mover and shaker to boot. Also, were he but
nominated, the proud boss of Nasty-Face Enterprises would be perpetual
hands-down winner of the title SH-one-T of the Year . . . and that
against stiff opposition from acknowledged 21-carat rotters.
Believed by himself alone to be a dynamic entrepreneur, thrusting and
upwardly mobile -- his ambition driven in a car with alphabet soup on
the boot lid and smoking tyres to stress to the world the importance of
his arrivals and departures -- Jack is a control freak.
He runs his business with the security cameras trained on staff
instead of the aisles where thieves reap a harvest of goods from his
many-times counted stock. He has computer systems so numerous that on
average at least one a day takes a funny turn and glues up the system.
As a computer whiz kid -- more kid than whiz it seems -- struggles to
unbug the system, no goods go out and no bread comes in. Poor Jack
Nasty-Face . . . finding it tough at the top even from his position
halfway down.
Jack is proud that neither boy nor girl, man nor beast, can put one
over on him. He has read the manuals, is a devout believer in the right
of management to manage regardless of good advice to the contrary, just
knows that all the world is worth the watching, has ensured that the
Smarties are counted twice daily . . . and has so far run one business
into the ground.
Now he has relocated, got another franchise enterprise to build and
stock a sales outlet for him, and is set to fail again: his complex
persona sufficient to fuel a week-long conference of psychiatrists, but
inadequate for a happy life among real people.
What would a psychiatrist -- or what would we, his potential customers
-- make of his habit of writing only in capital letters, a ruler to
guide his hand? What clues as to the mental scars left by over-strict
potty training are to be gleaned from the fact that when supplicants
call they are left to cool their heels for 15 minutes regardless, but
when those from whom he seeks advancement come to throw their weight
about he is out of his seat with all the speed of a ferret travelling up
a navvy's trouser leg?
He pays wages at a level that makes the poverty line look like loony
largesse, with one-quarter of income paid -- or not -- as bonus: Jack
Nasty-Face cast in the role of Damocles, the pay cheque calculated on
whim or fancy and no appeal. For this Jack demands, and such are the
times in which we live, that he gets, eight-and-a-half-hour shifts which
are all standing, no-meal-break affairs.
When required for heavy cleaning duties, staff must work through the
night -- 12 hours at a time -- and turn up, if called, for ''staff
training'' sessions just two hours after they have tumbled into bed.
Behind the till they must stay bright, look happy and SMILE. Given the
nature of their employer, their low wages, killer shifts, and the
expectation that they will not stray too far from home on days off --
just in case Nasty-Face Enterprises finds itself in a staffing bind --
keeping a convincing toothpaste grin in place is something of a
challenge.
Total flexibility and 24-hour respect for Jack's profit potential are
the prerequisites for a job that pays at a rate which leaves employees
open to claim, if they are so minded, virtually every state allowance
aimed at keeping body and soul together. Refreshed, renewed, they may
then push industrial cleaners over the shop floor or wipe down ceilings
eight till eight -- a vital cog in the Government's drive for a
low-wages labour force, honed, literally, to the bone, with which
Britain can attempt to compete against the economies of the Third World.
Now the reason I report the dirty tricks and sneaky techniques of this
unacceptable face of capitalism is that Jack Nasty-Face -- a real person
and well known to me -- and the battalions of his relatives, whom you
may know under a different name, are false prophets. The new dawn, if
and when it comes, will draw its light and warmth from education,
training, valued skills, and respect for the workforce rather than
greed, bully-boy tactics, rice-bowl wages, and total disregard for those
who cannot afford a personalised number plate . . . yes, Jack Nasty-Face
has one of those too, as well as an electronic speed-trap warning. Never
knowingly caught out is our Jack.
At a time when we have all recently looked, appalled, at a global
retrospective of man's inhumanity to man, the answer to the question
asked so often 50 years ago -- how did they not know what was happening
and do something about it? -- has yet to be satisfactorily answered. We
would do well to ask that question of ourselves today.

CARDINAL Thomas Winning, in his address to the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland, has done more damage to the Divine mission of the
Roman Catholic Church than Knox, Luther, and Cranmer could have hoped
for together.
His indifferentist vision of a gathering of ''all Scottish
Christians'' in the year 2000 was both irreconcilable with traditional
Catholic teaching and gravely unjust to those souls who separated from
the Church.
A few papal quotations from the pre-Revolutionary days of false
ecumenism will suffice to show how blurred the Cardinal's vision has
become.
In his encyclical (Mirari Vos) of August 15, 1832, for example, Pope
Gregory XVI stated: ''There is another prolific cause of evils with
which, we lament, the Church is at present afflicted. We mean
indifferentism, or that base opinion which has become prevalent
everywhere through the deceit of wicked men, that the soul's eternal
salvation can be procured by any profession of faith whatsoever,
provided that one's morals conform to the norms of justice and
probity.''
The same line was taken by Pope Leo XII in his encyclical (Ubi Primum)
of May 5, 1824: ''It is impossible for the most true God, who is Truth
itself, the best, the wisest provider, and the rewarder of good men, to
approve all sects who profess false teachings which are often
inconsistent with one another and contradictory, and to confer eternal
rewards on their members.''
Finally, in late December, 1949, Pope Pius XII made a truly Catholic
plea for Christian unity. Addressing the entire world he expressed the
hope that Holy Year, 1950, would be the year of the great return, to the
Catholic Church, of the Christian sects who were separated from the one
true fold.
It is my hope that Cardinal Winning will note the difference between
these holy Popes and himself. Theirs was a true vision of unity whilst
his is one of a new Tower of Babel.

SHADOW Health Secretary Robin Cook yesterday attacked the present
state of local pay negotiations for nurses and health workers.
He said he could not express his contempt too strongly for those
publicly inviting staff to negotiate locally, while privately planning
to cheat them.
The MP for Livingston cited as an example a report from the West
Lothian NHS Trust which is in his constituency, detailing a figure of
#200,000, alleging that management hoped to save the cash from local pay
bargaining.
''This confirms that the real objective of local pay bargaining is to
cut the NHS budget,'' he said. ''If all the 40-plus trusts in Scotland
are aiming for a similar target, we can expect millions of pounds to be
cut at the expense of Scottish health workers.''
He condemned what he called a cynical management strategy. He said
nurses were being conned into bargaining staff cuts for better pay, and
that the strategy picked on the weak, because nurses were neither the
strongest nor the richest in the health service.
Mr Cook, whose constituency takes in St John's Hospital in Livingston,
was speaking in the town at a news conference attended by hospital
staff.
The West Lothian NHS Trust, in initial negotiations, is offering a 1%
across the board award, followed by a payment of up to 2% on the basis
of a #1.3m cost improvement programme it requires.
However, a financial update document states categorically that
#200,000 is a target from local pay negotiations.
Last night, a trust spokesman said it had an overall cost improvement
set by Lothian Health of #1.3m in 1995-96, and the #200,000 represented
the difference between cost improvement programmes identified, and the
overall requirement.

I COULD not agree more with the comments made by P M Irvine about the
malaise in the Kirk. I am not surprised members and finance are falling.
A former Church of Scotland minister, I have belonged for the last 18
years to a growing, independent church made up of scores of young
people, many not yet earning much.
Yet we have recently completed a #90,000 expansion to our halls
without the aid of fund-raising activities in which we do not believe.
We do believe that if a work is God-directed, He will supply our needs;
the Bible says so.
We recently set aside a young couple for evangelism locally. It was
suggested they would need the support of the church as a whole and we
should show our support by having a special collection, there and then.
(This was after the weekly collection had already been uplifted.)
The sum taken in the second collection amounted to #7600. Some have
said to me, ''You must have many rich members''. We don't. But we do
have committed members.
The difference between our little church and so many much larger
churches is the difference between compromise in the preaching of the
unadulterated Word of God (as seen in so many parish kirks) and
commitment to the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

THE General Assembly of the Church of Scotland refused to make a law
whereby retired ministers who never attended Presbytery would retain
their secure seats for life but senior elders who attended regularly and
worked hard would be thrown off.
Stewart Lamont bemoans this refusal but what else could the Assembly
sensibly do?
One had not thought of Mr Lamont as an establishment hack, but only
such could describe as ''carefully crafted legislation'' this absurd
piece of elder-bashing.

She is English, a Tory councillor, and Christine Richard is sticking
to her guns on the principle of establishing a Scottish Parliament. Ruth
Wishart meets a Conservative who believes firmly that ''Scottish issues
need Scottish solutions''.
OVER the piece there have been some notable casualties falling off the
Tories' somewhat ramshackle devolution bandwagon. Ian Lang has gone from
fiery pamphleteer to arch defender of the unionist faith. Malcolm
Rifkind has travelled from fully-paid-up supporter to theoretical
federalist.
Struan Stevenson, along with my colleague Brian Meek, who is one of
the longest-serving standard bearers, seemed to undergo some strange
conversion on the road to Dumfries. Then again, he did badly want to be
selected.
But while others have deserted the cause or fled from the field of
fire, one Conservative devolver stands four-square for ''Scottish
solutions to Scottish problems''. Even if she is English, Councillor
Christine Richard must be in line for some kind of long-service medal.
Her last public outing was the Scottish Tories' conference in Glasgow.
Undaunted by the hostility of the Scottish Secretary or the promise of
hellfire from the Lord Chancellor, she got up there and told the
faithful that if they kept wittering on about cherishing the Union so
long as there was a single Conservative MP left . . . that's exactly
what they would have. If they got lucky.
Councillor Richard chuckles at the memory. She's sitting in her office
in Livingston where she's in charge of the enterprise and inward
investment programme of West Lothian College. And she tells you
cheerfully that, as the Bishop of Edinburgh might have it, she was well
and truly stitched up in Glasgow.
''Several people wanted to speak against the motion in that debate,
but they were never called. They only called me because they knew I
would make a fuss and give the press my speech anyway if they didn't. I
think you could say the debate was heavily stage-managed.''
This is not the kind of pronouncement likely to endear Councillor
Richard to the party hierarchy, but then she's a woman whose solitary
remaining political ambition is to sit in a Scottish Parliament.
When single-tier authorities arrive she will say goodbye to a
typically feisty career as an Edinburgh councillor. Meanwhile, she keeps
her hand in with a few informal gigs: such as accepting an invitation to
go to speak on the joys of self-determination in Ian Lang's
constituency. You just have to like this lady's style; and you just have
to admit that the raw material didn't seem promising for a
revolutionary.
Born and brought up in Yorkshire, she joined the Young Tories at 16,
clad in the standard equipment of tweed two-piece, twinset and pearls.
She loved the twinsets, she says; still loves the pearls. A spell at
secretarial college brought her briefly into contact with employment
before giving it all up for marriage at 19.
Even then, she seems to have been the sort who relished a challenge.
Her first husband was a 37-year-old widower with three sons aged under
six. At no extra charge, his mother and auntie lived with him. Richard's
mother wasn't the only friend to run a spot check on her sanity.
It was that marriage which brought her north to Scotland, and she
stayed put after she divorced 20 years ago.
Meanwhile, she hung on to her political virginity until 1974, and then
lost it in spectacular style. She stood in the election in what was then
the seat of Coatbridge and Airdrie. Not, you might suppose, hugely
fertile territory for the Blues. ''Most of the Tories lived in Airdrie
but my chairman lived in Coatbridge and we canvassed heavily everywhere.
''I went to see all the Catholic priests and told them I was working
for the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child. It was quite an
issue at the time, so they were very kind to me. I went to factories and
stood on tables in the lunchbreak. You just find reserves in yourself
you didn't know were there . . . it all makes you quite bold.'' Duly
emboldened, she had a bash at one of those new-fangled regional seats
that summer, before being adopted for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles for
the October contest.
''I think the party thought that if I could get 13,000 votes coming
second in Coatbridge and Aidrie, then I might be capable of better
things. In any case, Roxburgh said they'd tried everything from a
Catholic landowner to a rugby player, so they might as well try a
woman.'' The chair of the local association was John Richard, whom she
was later to marry. The relationship which developed during the campaign
caused the pair to become the talk of the rural steamies.
''Well, I can only say that he certainly saw me at my worst before he
ever saw me at my best. Forty-three speeches in two and a half weeks,
five different policies for five different towns. It was a hard slog and
I think we finally took about 2000 off David Steel's majority.''
The second marriage made her a stepmother all over again, since John
had four children -- one of them still at home. Richard has one child of
her own, daughter Fiona, but currently runs to seven step-grandchildren.
It also brought a period of enforced inactivity when John became chair
of the Stock Exchange and was required to be, at least nominally,
apolitical.
But she got fired up all over again with the Hillhead by-election, and
got herself back on the list of candidates, initially in England. ''I
went to one of these army-style selection weekends where they stick
coloured labels on you. Two of the other women in that intake were Olga
Maitland and Gillian Shephard.'' Richard even made the short leet for
her old stomping ground of Keithley.
But it was Edinburgh and local government which brought her back,
quite literally, into the fray. Standing as group secretary two minutes
after arrival is not quite the done Conservative thing -- though staging
a successful coup against the existing group leadership further down the
line has more of a traditional ring to it.
All that, plus controversial trips to South Africa, kept her in the
headlines -- visibility which didn't always play well in her own
gallery. ''They used to call me the Obergruppenfuhrer, or OGF for
short!'' And throughout it all, she flew the flag for devolution.
Of course, in the early eighties that was alright. Ted Heath had made
the Declaration of Perth, later endorsed by the Blue Baroness.
Christine's husband, John, had even sat on the panel advising him on
Scottish policy.
''They came up with an idea for assemblymen -- no women mind you --
whom they planned to pay #120 per year.
''People like me are being made to feel disloyal because the party,
especially John Major, has made the so-called sanctity of the Union the
big issue. You're considered not just disloyal but suicidal.
''Yet the justice of the case is beyond doubt. It's also pragmatic if
we want to increase our support. In many parts of Scotland a lot of
people who support the SNP would vote Conservative if we had a policy on
devolution. Of course, I'm prepared to concede there are dangers, but
even if it all led to a greater level of independence, I'm not scared of
that.
''All this stuff about the business community leaving is patently
untrue. I've had letters from many of them. And I know from my work here
that many people who invest in Scotland come here because of a skilled
workforce, good productivity and because it is Scotland. I know many of
them would welcome decisions on grants and training being made
locally.''
She watches with interest as other players in the game subtly, and not
so subtly, shift ground. Struan Stevenson, she says, has blundered
tactically by trying to play the unionist card in Dumfries. And what of
Michael Forsyth, erstwhile arch-unionist, apparently now flirting with
flexibility. ''Strange isn't it? Normally you'd say the Tory right is
very pro-Union. But Michael, above all else, is a pragmatist and he can
be convincing if he takes the gamble and says he's had a blinding
conversion.''
As she speaks of the Prince of Darkness, her office lights flicker out
briefly.
She tries not to draw any obvious conclusion. But she is unshakeable
in her belief that the party is speeding along the path to possible
oblivion in Scotland. ''They say it's not an election issue, but because
it's now so deep in the Scottish psyche, it's the issue against which
everything else is judged and, in the case of my party, found wanting.''
Bold words, from a bold lady. And if she repeats them on her visit to
Lang country, I've a notion she'll get a better reception than the
conference gave her.

THE future of Europe's smallest cathedral hangs in the balance because
of fading interest and rising maintenance costs.
Now the latest phase of a restoration appeal is to be coupled with a
message throughout Scotland that the Cathedral of the Isles, on the Isle
of Cumbrae, must be supported to ensure its survival.
The cathedral at Millport is coupled with the former theological
college of the Scottish Episcopal Church, which is now used as a retreat
for conferences and holidays.
Last year, however, there were just 1600 bed nights taken up in the
college buildings, and as many as 3500 are needed to make it viable.
The Rev Dale Gray, who took over the cathedral in February, said: ''I
have to look at this as a business and attract people to use it.
''We have a magnificent asset, not just for our church, but for the
whole of Scotland, it would be a tragedy if it were to be lost.''
The former Home Office civil servant, who joined the ministry three
years ago at the age of 50, added: ''The college buildings need people
in them to survive, and the loyal staff who have served the cathedral so
well need people to keep them in a job. If the college goes, then I fear
it would be the thin end of a very fast moving wedge.
''The closure of the cathedral could not be ruled out.''
This weekend, the Earl of Glasgow, whose ancestor George Frederick --
the sixth earl -- had the cathedral built after being drawn to the
Anglican Church at Oxford in the 1840s, will launch the latest phase of
the restoration project.
It is hoped to attract #110,000 of support for the North College
windows to be replaced, chimneys and gutters to be repaired, and the
bells restored to their former glory.
For many years the bells have been silent, and it is hoped to have
them ringing again by July 19, when the Princess Royal visits the
island. As well as visiting the Marine Biological Station in her role as
Chancellor of the University of London, Princess Anne is to dedicate the
new bells.
The Cathedral of the Isles, which remains a collegiate church in which
the two dozen or so local episcopalian faithful worship because they
have no parish church, was completed in 1851, and ranks with Keeble
College Oxford and All Saints, Margaret Street, London, as among
architect William Butterfield's finest works.

Stephen McGinty reports on a Scottish film producer's battle against
time, leukaemia, Hollywood, and a financing fiasco to achieve victory in
Cannes.
WHEN Carrington won the special jury prize at Cannes on Sunday night,
the film's producer, John McGrath, was present -- but only just.
However, it was not leukaemia, which the playwright had battled against
while raising the film's finance of #3.75m, that caused the problems. It
was geography.
McGrath was sitting in Edinburgh at his breakfast table on Sunday
morning when he received a frantic call urging his immediate return to
the French film festival.
''I dashed to the airport, flew to London then on to Nice where I was
met by a car which got me to the cinema where the ceremony was taking
place with about 20 seconds to spare.''
It was a race against time which won the founding artistic director of
7:84 Scotland, new acclaim in the film world. Carrington was written by
Christopher Hampton, a decade before he won an Oscar for Dangerous
Liaisons. However, it took McGrath's mettle to raise the necessary
funds.
The story of a platonic relationship between the painter Dora
Carrington and literary critic Lytton Strachey during Britain's
Bloomsbury era had always failed to attract the required backing, but
just two years after a deal was struck between Hampton and McGrath in
Los Angeles, the film is a true success story.
To complement the special jury prize, actor Jonathan Pryce won the
award for best actor at the 48th Cannes International Film Festival,
while Emma Thompson has been praised by critics in the title role. It
was her backing for the film, McGrath said, which attracted the
money-men.
''She was terrific; after she'd read the script she said this was the
film she wanted to do.'' McGrath had known Jonathan Pryce since they
worked on a play John wrote called Fish In The Sea in Liverpool in 1971.
Even with a strong cast there remained problems raising money.
First McGrath had to secure the rights to the screenplay. Then the
financing fiasco began. German money was lost when the boss was sacked;
British Screen were said to be interested before they ran out of cash;
Channel 4 were reluctant to invest as they found both main characters
too unsympathetic.
During this time McGrath continued to fly between his Edinburgh New
Town flat and Hollywood for increasingly unsuccessful meetings.
Then in April 1993 he was taken to University College Hospital in
London, struck down by a strain of leukaemia.
For four months he was bed-ridden, but maintained contact with
financiers from Italy, Belgium, and Spain. Since then he has made a full
recovery, a point which he is keen to emphasise.
''When I went into hospital the doctors told me 'it's going to take a
long time and be very painful, but you're not going to die'. And they
were right, it did take a long time, it was very painful, and I didn't
die. And I felt the same way about this movie -- I knew it would take
time but that we would make the film.''
The French were the most consistently interested in investing.
Companies such as Cinea put their money where McGrath's mouth was and
were later joined by Polygram. But just as the money was secured they
lost Mike Newell, the film's original director. He was offered a
Hollywood movie while he was filming Four Weddings and a Funeral.
Although a celebrated screenwriter, Christopher Hampton had never
directed before, but surrounded by a crew hand-picked by McGrath, he
completed the film's nine-week shoot in 52 locations on time and
slightly under budget. ''He is a clever guy and we had every confidence
in him. It was a happy shoot which usually means a lousy film, but not
this time.''
McGrath was talking through the static of a mobile phone as he was
driven through the French mountains towards home and a task no less
monumental. The next film to be produced through his Freeway Films
production company will be The Silver Darlings.
''I just hope that the success of Carrington will carry on and help
with my screen adaptation of Neil Gunn's The Silver Darlings. I've just
finished the screenplay and I plan to stay out of hospital for this
one.''

Is there a solution to the conflict that has torn the former
Yugoslavia apart or is it time for the United Nations to accept the
inevitable and pull out? Ian Bruce looks at the options -- and their
inherent dangers.
THE United Nations is today running out of time and choices in Bosnia.
Reinforcement of the 3380 British troops there threatens to create a new
North-West Frontier mentality while more than 300 peacekeepers remain
hostages and human shields.
The Serbs have indisputably won the first round in the battle to
obtain a free hand in the country's central region. They have also dealt
UN credibility a body blow from which it may never recover.
And, as Western politicians pontificate and struggle to come up with
the kind of unified policy which should have been in place before the
first peacekeeper's boot crossed the Bosnian frontier, the lives of tens
of thousands of civilians are again at risk.
Britain's commitment of an immediate 1200 engineers and gunners
signals the intention to pull back isolated garrisons and outposts and
to set up fortified perimeters around threatened ''safe havens'' such as
Tuzla, Gorazde, Srebrenica, Sarajevo and Zepce.
But to achieve any level of security, those perimeters will have to be
pushed out in a 15 to 16-mile radius to remove the towns from the
effective range of Serb artillery in the surrounding hills. Defensive
positions will have to be dug and manned to cover every road and track
with machine-guns and anti-tank weapons.
Even with total air superiority and the help of helicopters, it would
be next to impossible to prevent the infiltration of small raiding
parties of infantry armed with rockets and mortars. Every strongpoint
will become a target and the night will belong to the Serbs.
It begs the pressing question of how food and medical aid convoys are
to be escorted to areas of need. It would take, even at a conservative
Nato estimate, upwards of 50,000 men to control the heights dominating
the main convoy routes along winding mountain roads.
If the bulk of the UN military contingents are tied up in static
defence, who will ride shotgun on the trucks which have kept millions of
tonnes of vital supplies flowing to those whose lives have depended on
their delivery over more than 32 months? Failure to deliver would negate
the main reason for the UN's presence in the first place.
The British alone have shepherded more than 300,000 tonnes of food,
fuel, drinking water, and medicines to front-line towns since October,
1992, averaging 400,000 road miles a month in the process.
Even more contentious might be how the UN intends to establish its
perimeters. If the Serbs currently entrenched within sniper-shot of
places such as Sarajevo refuse to depart voluntarily, their positions
will have to be attacked. It means a mighty leap from peacekeeping to
peacemaking -- and some might say war-making -- at one fell swoop.
As a symbol of UN and Western resolve, Sarajevo would have to become
the focus of attention. Its airfield would be a key point for
reinforcement and resupply.
But lifting the Serb stranglehold on its surrounding hills would be a
mammoth task, entailing hard fighting and heavy casualties. There are no
quick-fix, hi-tech alternatives for storming bunker lines in mountains
where the defenders have every local advantage.
But the UN has two other principal options open to it. Both are
unpalatable. The first involves enforcing peace on the entire country.
That would be tantamount to declaring war on both the Bosnian Serbs and
their more numerous and better-equipped cousins across the border in
Serbia proper.
The Serbs could not win, even if they joined forces. They would lose
the war. But they have the ability to turn subsequent peacekeeping
missions into mini-Vietnams, inflicting unacceptable casualties in the
running sore of a never-ending guerrilla campaign.
The second option would be to swallow collective pride and accept the
fact that civil war is a way of life in the former Yugoslavia. Its
people have, after all, been killing each other with utmost savagery for
the best part of 500 years, and they are good at it.
In that scenario, the UN would have to conduct a complete and
humiliating withdrawal, abandoning or blowing up heavy equipment where
it could not be removed easily, and airlifting out exposed troops by
helicopter.
Given that the last thing either the Bosnian Croats or Muslims wish to
see is the withdrawal of the UN forces, leaving the Serbs to wage
all-out ethnic war, any retreat by road on the few, difficult routes
back to the Croatian coast is a potential nightmare.
The other protagonists might decide to take UN hostages themselves, or
to block or demolish escape routes. Desperate elements might even turn
it into a fighting withdrawal, making the UN pay in lives and vehicles
for every kilometre back to safety.
With world media attention on the area, human roadblocks composed of
women and children would seal the demise of the UN's place in world
affairs while the Serbs harried their rearguards. It would be an apt
Yugoslavian revenge for outside interference in their endless internal
feuds.
Perhaps the reality that the UN, Nato, and the Western European Union
may have to face soon is that there is no solution, peaceful or
otherwise, to the woes of that birthplace of Balkan strife.

Graham Ogilvy reports on the fanatical bird-watchers for whom seeing
is believing, no matter the price.
ALONE Siberian eye-browed thrush hopping around Auchmithie's old
kirk-yard sparked the alert. But it was the flock of grown men which
threatened to outnumber the population of the tiny Angus fishing village
that caused local bewilderment.
Cars screeched to a halt. Their occupants, clutching telescopes,
tripods and binoculars, scrambled out dashing to catch a glimpse of a
Russian rara avis thousands of miles off its migratory course.
Well over 100 twitchers had arrived by yesterday afternoon to view a
bird that last made a spring appearance in Scotland 14 years ago and to
add it to their treasured list of sightings. Some had dropped everything
and travelled hundreds of miles for the ''twitch''.
The news of the discovery had spread quickly among the hi-tech
twitchers who carry radio-pagers, mobile phones, and CB radios.
An eagle-eyed local twitcher had followed his hunch that strong
south-easterly winds and heavy overnight rain might force migratory
birds down to seek shelter on the Angus coastline.
Unable to believe his luck, he called Birdline Scotland, the premium
payphone service which takes 150 calls a day, to report his sighting,
and the rest is twitching history. A Siberian eye-browed thrush had made
its seventh recorded visit to Scotland and eighteenth to Britain.
One of the first on the scene was Rab Shand, 39, from Bo'ness, who
works full-time for Birdline Scotland, making a haphazard living from a
hobby that has become an obsession and cost him his marriage.
He explained: ''This bird could fly off this evening, if it is a clear
enough night for it to see the stars. A lot of English lads, from
Merseyside and Leeds, have been up to see it.''
Peering through his telescope at the distant speck, he added: ''This
bird was probably returning from India to Siberia when it was blown off
course. It certainly should not be here.''
Shand, a former engineer, has been a twitcher for 15 years and has
travelled around the world to watch birds and will make his second trip
to South America in November.
The biggest twitch ever in Scotland was last year at Birkhead in the
north-east when 1500 turned out to see a grey-tailed tattler. On that
occasion, says Shand, police stopped 80 twitchers for speeding north on
the A9 -- ''one of them four times!''. He believes that twitching is
growing in popularity thanks to increased environmental awareness,
improved communications, and the shedding of its ''wimpish'' image.
Twitching, it should be stressed, is different from ornithology. They,
according to Shand are ''a stuck-up lot from the professional classes
who look down on twitchers''. Twitchers should also be distinguished
from mere birdwatchers, a tame lot who rarely leave their own patch to
view a rare specimen.
Twitchers, the rapid-response stormtroopers of the bird-watching
world, are drawn from all backgrounds but tend to be overwhelmingly
male. There is male bonding as campaign tales are swapped and lists
compared. But one veteran, 46-year-old Geoff Boyce from Middlesborough,
accompanied by his wife Lynn, complains: ''It is getting too competitive
now. You hear too much of 'my list is bigger than yours'. It is getting
too macho.''
Steelworker Martin Sidwell, 33, who has travelled from the North of
England, admits that twitching can become obsessive and explains the
origins of the term: ''When you hear that a rare bird has been sighted,
you start to twitch with nerves. You can only relieve it by setting off
to see the bird. It doesn't matter if you don't actually see it, as long
as you have made the effort.
''I travelled 2030 miles, from Wick to Kent and the Scottish Borders,
in 72 hours in the hope of seeing four birds. I only saw one, but it
stopped me twitching.''
With his Rare Bird Alert pager, #500 telescope and #800 binoculars,
Sidwell returns to the fray, following every movement of the Siberian
eye-browed thrush. Another addition to his list.

James McKillop sets the scene for the #10m trial of Kevin and Ian
Maxwell which begins tomorrow.
IT has been a long wait for Mirror Group pensioners, including those
formerly employed by the Daily Record and Sunday Mail, but after almost
four years of investigation and legal preparations the trial of Kevin
and Ian Maxwell will finally get under way tomorrow.
Almost overnight a seeming family tragedy developed into a legal
nightmare for the two brothers. Within days of his burial in Israel and
with speculation still at its height over whether Robert Maxwell had
died from natural causes or had committed suicide in spectacular fashion
by jumping overboard from his luxurious yacht on November 5, 1991, it
was learned that the media tycoon had callously plundered his company's
pension funds in a desperate bid to stave off creditors, ruin, and
certain arrest.
The body of the publisher -- universally known as Captain Bob -- had
been found floating in the Atlantic off the Canary Islands. The Serious
Fraud Office immediately launched a high-profile investigation. That
inquiry eventually led to the arrests of Maxwell's sons in the summer of
1992.
Tomorrow Kevin, 36, and brother Ian, 38, together with co-defendants
Larry Trachtenberg, 42, and Robert Bunn, 47, will appear before a High
Court judge and a jury on charges of conspiracy to defraud. Mr
Trachtenberg was a director of various Maxwell companies and Mr Bunn a
finance director.
The trial is expected to last six months. Each of the defendants has
been granted legal aid and the eventual cost to the taxpayer is likely
to be well in excess of #10m. Even before the trial proper gets under
way tomorrow, the legal bill of the four defendants has exceeded #4.75m.
The very nature of fraud cases ensures that the hearing will not
provide the day-to-day drama associated with major criminal trials.
Indeed, the hearing is not being held at the Old Bailey, but in Court No
22 in the modern building of Chicester Rents in London's Chancery Lane
-- little more than a stone's throw from the former Holburn headquarters
of the Mirror Publishing group.
The building will create a modern business-style atmosphere in which
the jury will be able to scrutinise thousands of documents on computer
terminals, but at the same time preserve the dignity of a courtroom.
It was also deemed suitable because it offered space for an expected
massive press and media turnout. However, by last week only a fraction
of press applications had been received for the 70 available media
places.
Those journalists who had applied by then are guaranteed a seat
throughout the trial. Those who failed to apply will have to take their
chances on a day-to-day basis.
The trial judge, Sir Nicholas Phillips, at 57, is no old fuddy-duddy.
Often he likes to arrive at court on a bicycle. He handled the infamous
Barlow Clowes trial and proved that he has all the necessary experience
and ability to try a complicated and sensitive fraud case with
considerable expertise.
Unusually, if not uniquely, he intends to address journalists before
the trial proper begins. Unquestionably he intends to set the ground
rules for what will be a long and arduous hearing.
Pre-trial planning has been meticulous. Jury selection began more than
two weeks ago with a list of 700 potential jurors. The jury of seven
women and five men was selected from a final shortlist of 70.
Despite the length of the trial every care has been taken to ensure
jury members will be as comfortable as possible and to relieve strain on
their concentration in what will be a complicated case.
Although their day will begin at 9.30am, they will sit for only four
hours. Afternoons have been set aside for the legal debates that are
heard in the absence of a jury in any trial.
* The Crown case will be led by Alan Suckling, QC, and Richard
Lissack, QC; for Kevin Maxwell -- Alan Jones, QC, and Clare Montgomery;
Ian Maxwell -- Edmund Lawson, QC, and Peter Doyle; Larry Trachtenberg --
Michael Hill, QC; Robert Bunn -- Peter Rook, QC.

Britain's fashion perfectionist died of cancer at the weekend in the
London Clinic. She was 66. Anne Simpson offers an appreciation.
THE appearance always was deceptive. Frail as a fern, Jean Muir was
barely 5ft tall, yet she vibrated with creative force, spindly fingers
ever itching to get a pencil in their grasp, the voice jabbing the air
with words in an edgy staccato, and her sentences ending with that
peculiar, little squeal. A sort of personal antiphon defying doubt.
A few years ago when she was on one of her visits to Glasgow, we found
ourselves in the cafe at the Burrell Collection. What would she like to
eat? Without hesitation she requested a pint of lager, quiche and chips
and, oh yes, a doughnut. Settled by the window, the fabled minimalist
scoffed the lot with relish. So the fragility was indeed deceptive. In
fact it was a sort of inverted armour hiding the steel within.
Her reputation as a great designer was one of the few absolutes in a
perfidious trade. Against all the industry's destructive whims Miss Muir
was durable, changeless, ageless, timeless.
And to those but her closest friends it always was Miss Muir. She had
been lucky, she said, to have grown up during that final period when the
discipline of Paris couture still held sway. She did not care for its
elitism but she liked certain aspects of its authority. Thus, just as
there was M Bohan at Dior and now there is Mr Armani in Milan, so there
was Miss Muir in London; never Jean to her studio and workshop staff,
and certainly never Jean to the international press.
Everything about her proclaimed a sense of order. She was one of those
compact individuals who, early on, discovers an exterior style and holds
firmly to it right through life. The cinnamon lipstick and brown shadow
applied around the khaki eyes were a strict choice but one which
emphasised the dramatic pallor of her skin.
The brown hair, uncompromisingly straight, was drawn back behind the
ears to finish precisely at the nape. She wore no jewellery, not even a
wedding band, except for two gold rings on her little finger, and
sometimes, at the throat, a plain gold brooch. Even the clothes she wore
were essentially the same: the countless little silk jersey slacks and
tunics all reflecting her commitment to black and navy, the colours of
elegant gravitas.
But almost 30 years of acclamation did not rid her of a
perfectionist's irritation with the word fashion itself.''I loathe it'',
she would say. ''The trouble is there is nothing to replace it. But it
can be such a blight on design -- fashion is so faddish, so ephemeral
and lightweight. Which is why I would like to be remembered as a
dressmaker.''
This was no feigned modesty, just common sense, a quality Jean Muir
prized highly and attributed to her Aberdonian parentage. She lived her
whole life in London but still felt herself to be inescapably Scottish
-- tenacious, independent, ''very severe'' in matters of self-criticism.
And Scotland, laterally responded with its own plaudits. Last year the
National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh purchased her sculpted head by
Glenys Barton, and in November she became the first women to deliver the
Gillies Lecture at the Royal Scottish Academy.
With clothes, she told her audience gathered to commemorate the memory
of the painter Sir William Gillies, we make pictures for others to look
at. Last year, too, she received a Hall of Fame honour in the British
Fashion Awards -- a decade earlier she had been decorated with the CBE
-- and it was last year, too, that she began a two-year tenure as master
of the Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry, regarding the purpose of
her term as a chance to plant an understanding of design's worth in
Britain's consciousness.
She knew, though, that this was a daunting struggle. Jean Muir was our
most illustrious fashion star yet in recent years she scarcely received
the publicity she deserved at home because her quietly intellectual,
gentle style did not sit well with the strip-joint obsessions of
London's designer brats.
''We just didn't cherish her enough,'' says Rita Britton, one of the
country's most inspirational fashion retailers.
''I remember once talking to a French woman of great style at Azzedine
Alaia, and Miss Muir's name cropped up. 'You British don't deserve her.
Had Jean Muir been born in France she would have been up there', and she
raised her hand indicating the tallest public pedestal. Recently her
collections were the only reason overseas retailers came to London, and
as far as I can see there is no-one out there now who can replace her. I
feel as if I've lost a relative and a friend, but that aside it is a
tragedy for the British fashion industry.''
That constancy and unchanging quality, of course, can sometimes be the
enemy of design, reducing it to something moribund and facile. Yet the
merest glance at a Jean Muir outfit confirms it as work not easily
accomplished. Every aspect of the silhouette, every detail of proportion
was the result of weeks spent searching out ideas, then paring them down
to the ultimate refinement.
So the phrases Essence of Simplicity, and Purest Chic hung about her
clothes like price tags, but they are misleading, conveying none of the
sensuality of her designs.
Not formally trained but one who learned her craft first in the
stockroom at Libertys, then in the knitwear section of Jaeger, Jean Muir
was quite frankly our best classical designer, perhaps the only one who
could convincingly tailor the demure in such a way that it glided
seductively over every contour of the torso, or else, with its fluid
curves, presented skilful camouflage for the less-than-perfect figure.
''You don't have to have your bosoms hanging out to look sexy,'' she
would say. ''I'm a very anatomical designer, and because I use a lot of
jersey I cut it totally into the body so that when it is worn it feels
quite sensuous. But I try to work things out so that they will give
people a nice shape and hide what they don't want anybody to see.''
She was an admirer of Margaret Thatcher but, as the recession
continued to savage the textile and fashion trades, she became deeply
dismayed by our loss of craftsmanship and technical expertise.
''Students were sometimes reluctant to go on a placement to Jean Muir
because she was such a hard task master,'' recalls Rita Britton. ''She
would make them pick up every scrap of material from the floor before
they left in the evening, and place all their tools two inches apart and
facing the same way, on the table. But I'd say to them: 'Don't you
realise, she's teaching you to be proud of your craft. She's making you
artisans'.''
Of her own style Jean Muir used just one word, economic. Yet this made
her sound far too serious-minded. Inside that small, unfussy frame there
was a well of self-deprecating humour typified by her persistent belief
that her friends always looked far better than she did. Never mind, to a
woman they wore her clothes and, in almost 30 years their loyalty never
faltered. In her own globe-spinning existence there were two fixed
locations. The first, her London home, possesses completely white
interiors acting like a naked canvas so that people within the rooms
compose a natural picture.
The second was her country house in Northumberland to which she and
her German-born husband Harry Leuckert retreated whenever the whirl of
fashion could be put on hold. Leuckert was her financial director,
radiating quiet good manners, thrift, and profound control.
Once an actor, he meandered into selling clothes in the most casual
way: ''Jean was in America. Someone rang with a query. I knew the answer
so . . . I went into the business''. Her taste in art delighted in
iconoclasts: the Dadaists and Jasper Johns particularly. More recently
she added Scots painters to her collection, including Hugh Gilmour and
Mary McLean.
In our last conversation she said she had been very struck by an
interview she had seen the previous evening on television: a young RAF
pilot, a veteran of the Gulf war, was talking about how he was afraid of
dying for his family's sake but didn't fear losing his own life as such
because he said: When you number's up, that's it. ''And perhaps that
really is how it is,'' she said, ''But all the more reason to make the
best of every single moment.'' What were we here for, Jean Muir mused,
if not to make our world as interesting as possible. And she added that
funny, little antiphon defying doubt.

SCOTS planning to sue Hoover over its free flights offer have been
boosted by the company's failure to stop a mass legal action in England.
They could now stand a better chance of winning any court actions, it
was claimed last night.
It emerged yesterday that a judge in St Helens has quashed an
application from the electrical giant to have 127 cases brought by
dissatisfied customers struck out before they come to court.
Merseyside solicitor Mr Denis Whalley, representing the claimants,
said Hoover had appealed against the judge's ruling but they were
confident the company would not succeed.
He said he was seeking compensation of around #5000 for each double
ticket claimant for disappointment and loss of enjoyment.
Describing Hoover's appeal as a cynical attempt to delay proceedings,
he asked other dissatisfied customers to come forward to provide further
evidence for the case.
The free flight offer, with the purchase of a Hoover product, was
launched in November 1991. However, an avalanche of customers complained
after they were unable to get tickets for the flights they wanted.
Only a handful of the 600,000 people entitled to tickets have taken
Hoover to court individually. Most of those who have taken action have
won the cost of their tickets.
The judge's decision, which could result in a trial later this summer,
was welcomed by Mr Sandy Jack, chairman of the Scottish pressure group
set up to fight for compensation,
At his home in Methil, Fife, 72-year-old Mr Jack described how he
intended to continue his fight against the domestic appliance giant on
behalf of consumers in spite of losing his own compensation claim at
Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court.
He said he would be returning to the United States this summer to meet
an American consumer expert with a view to raising possibe actions in
the US. Last year Mr Jack took his pressure group's concerns to Hoover's
parent company, the Maytag Corporation.
''The giant is starting to topple. I would like people to know that
they were misled in the first place and not to give up. People are
entitled to their rights,'' he said.
Mr Jack, a former commando, said a number of cases were still being
fought in the small claims courts in Scotland and the English action
could set a precedent. He said he had spent thousands of pounds of his
own money on the campaign.
No one from Hoover was available for comment.

AN ex-paratrooper terrorised neighbours with a foot-long bread knife
and a pick-axe handle just four days after avoiding a jail sentence for
causing a gun scare at Aviemore Health Centre.
John Gartshore, 40, was jailed for three months by Sheriff William
Fulton at Inverness Sheriff Court yesterday.
Gartshore had been ordered to carry out 220 hours community service on
May 15 for disorderly conduct, producing a replica pistol, placing staff
in a state of fear and alarm, and breaching the peace at Aviemore Health
Centre on April 24. He has 11 previous convictions, including one of
assaulting a dog.
The court heard that Gartshore ''frightened the life'' out of two
neighbours when he brandished the weapons in their homes four days after
his previous court appearance.
Depute fiscal Mr Ron Phillips said Gartshore had set out from a
woman's house threatening to ''get'' a man who, it was alleged, had
verbally abused the woman.
The first neighbour, another woman, had later become aware of
Gartshore standing in her darkened living-room doorway holding what she
first thought was a baseball bat.
Gartshore told her he was going to get a man called Archie, and then
drew a foot-long bread knife from the waist of his trousers despite
being told he was in the wrong house.
After leaving the woman's home, he went next door to a house belonging
to a man he had known for 20 years, the court heard. He repeatedly
shouted ''Are you in?'', smashed a pane of glass at the front door, then
entered and waved the knife at the man in a menacing manner.
The second neighbour eventually persuaded him to place the knife on a
sideboard. Police, alerted by the first neighbour, traced him at the
front door, where they found the pick-axe handle.
The second neighbour was reluctant to talk to police about the
incident, and full details only emerged the next day when they arrested
Gartshore in Inverness.
He had voluntarily attended the town's Craig Dunain Hospital and was
picked up by police after leaving the institution against medical
advice.
Gartshore, of Milton Park, Aviemore, admitted possession of the
pick-axe handle on Grampian and Burnside roads, Aviemore, on May 19 this
year.
He also admitted brandishing the pick-axe handle and knife and
breaching the peace at two addresses on Burnside Road, Aviemore, and
causing wilful and reckless damage by smashing a pane of glass.

ONE Republican and four Orange marches have been given the go-ahead by
Lothian Region, in spite of a recent plea from the Scottish Police
Federation for the banning of all sectarian parades.
Councillors were told at a meeting of the region's transportation
committee yesterday that three of the Orange marches -- in Armadale,
Musselburgh and Haddington -- were not expected to create problems.
However, Assistant Chief Constable Tom Wood, of Lothian and Borders
Police, reported that there was the risk of public disorder at the other
two parades, both scheduled for Edinburgh.
The James Connolly Society had applied to march through the city this
Saturday to commemorate the birth of Connolly, who was born in Edinburgh
and executed for his part in the Easter Rising.
Conservative councillors Tom Ponton and Ian Hoy moved that the march
be banned.
The other problem application was that by the Pride of Midlothian
Independent Orange Lodge No 160, for a march on June 17. Mr Wood said
the organisers had cancelled the parade last year because of anticipated
trouble.

A BOY aged 21-months could have opened a window safety catch with
slight pressure and fallen to his death, a fatal accident inquiry heard
yesterday.
Mr James Younger, 47, a senior lecturer in civil engineering at
Paisley University, told the inquiry at Haddington Sheriff Court that
the spring of the safety device had been rigorously tested for repeated
usage.
The catch had also been tested to endure the sudden application of a
130lbs weight. However, it was ''entirely possible'' the safety catch
could have been overcome by the child.
Mr Younger was the last witness giving evidence on the sixteenth of
the inquiry into the death of Ewan Smith.
Ewan died in the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, on June 9, 1994,
two days after falling 30ft from the second-storey bedroom window of a
council flat in Moir Crescent, Musselburgh, East Lothian.
Mr Younger said he was involved in the performance and specification
of windows and that it was only relatively recently there had been any
standards set.
He said he had carried out several tests on windows which had failed
in accidental circumstances involving children where the application of
force may have been a factor.
The standard of force needed to open a window was usually below that
required by an elderly person and within the capacity of a child, said
Mr Younger.
The slim stop restrictor device on the emergency fire escape window
from which Ewan had fallen would have opened easily by the application
of adult finger pressure, Mr Younger claimed.
He had tested the window but had been unable to get it almost closed
without the safety catch coming into operation.
It is thought Ewan opened the window latch, overcamea safety
restrictor catch and fell to his death.
Experts at the inquiry have disagreed over whether a child could climb
from a bed on to a window sill, release the main latch handle and
overcome the safety catch.
The inquiry continues on June 14 for legal submissions.

A MAJOR section of Union Street, for 200 years Aberdeen's main
thoroughfare, may be closed to traffic.
Aberdeen City Council's planning officer, Mr Bert Allen, is
recommending that the historic street be pedestrianised between Bridge
Street and Market Street.
He believes a pedestrianisation scheme is vital to encourage the use
of public transport, reduce pollution, ease congestion, improve
pedestrian safety and enhance the environment for shoppers.
Mr Allen will tell the council's planning committee on Thursday that
consultants have recommended three possible courses of action to exclude
traffic from what is believed to be one of the earliest and finest
flyovers in the world.
The first is that Union Street be closed to all traffic except buses,
and Upperkirkgate between Broad Street and Flourmill Lane also be fully
pedestrianised.
The second option is to close Union Street to all traffic except
westbound buses, with eastbound buses being diverted either via Guild
Street or Upperkirkgate.
The third possibility is that Union Street be fully pedestrianised and
existing bus routes are diverted via Bridge Street/Guild Street/Market
Street.
Mr Allen says that it would be desirable for Union Street ultimately
to be fully pedestrianised, but it is important to achieve the best
possible public transport service. On balance he supports the first
option.
However, he feels the pedestrianisation of Upperkirkgate should be
extended to Back Wynd to discourage the ''rat running'' of traffic
between the Gallowgate and Guild Street via East Green.
The feasibility study was commissioned by Grampian Regional Council.
Mr Allen recommends that the two councils should discuss the proposals.

TOKYO: About 10,000 Japanese war veterans held a rally in Tokyo
yesterday in protest against a parliamentary resolution which apologises
for Japan's Second World War aggression. The resolution is sponsored by

COLOMBO: British tourists are flocking to Sri Lanka despite a raging
war with Tamil separatists. The Ceylon Tourist Board said it expected a
30% increase in arrivals from Britain this year. Beach resorts in the
south-west and the ''cultural triangle'' of the island's ancient
capitals were the main draws, even though two of those capitals,
Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura, were close to recent trouble areas.

Brussels, Monday
TWO hundred noisy animal rights activists, massed behind barbed-wire
barricades, blew whistles and chanted slogans demanding a ban on the
export of live farm animals before a meeting of European Union Farm
Ministers today.
Protesters from across Europe, some wearing animal masks, waved
banners saying ''Shame'' and ''Veal crates are cruel'' and booed
Ministers including Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave.
They also jeered at an ultra-modern Swedish cattle lorry, equipped
with sprinklers and fans to cool animals, parked in front of the new
headquarters of the EU's Council of Ministers.
Swedish Agriculture Minister Margareta Winberg will invite her EU
colleagues to visit the lorry, which is equipped with TV cameras to
enable the driver to monitor the animals, to show how transport
conditions can be improved.
Millions of animals are transported annually in over-full lorries on
journeys often of more than 50 hours from northern producer countries to
southern slaughterhouses.
Italy and other southern states say stricter rules would raise costs,
making imports of live animals uneconomic and resulting in the loss of
thousands of jobs.
Ministers, deadlocked for 22 months over fixing maximum journey times
and rest periods, again failed to make a decision on ways to improve
transport conditions, leaving traders and producers facing continued
uncertainty.
Efforts to end the stalemate are now focused on proposals for an
eight-hour maximum journey time. British officials said this was more
acceptable than previous proposals.

THE Scots-based International Rescue team is set to fly out to try to
aid victims of the earthquake which hit the Russian island of Sakhalin.
As teams in Russia's far east redoubled efforts early today to find
survivors in the wreckage, saying that many of the 2000 people buried in
the earthquake were still alive, the crew of 13 men and two women, from
Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, have offered their highly specalised
life-saving skills.
The tremor, measuring 7.5 on the open-ended Richter scale, flattened
the oil town of Neftegorsk early on Sunday, crushing people in their
homes while they slept.
''There are many people still alive. Our main task is to keep on
working,'' said a spokesman for the rescue services.
Mr Willie McMartin, operations director, said yesterday: ''We are on
standby and ready to go at a minute's notice.
''We have been in contact with the Russian Embassy in London and the
United Nations in Geneva. They say an assessment of the devastated area
is being carried out.
''When that is completed, we will know if we are needed. But we expect
a call to go. The reports from the region are horrendous.''
International Rescue's skills have saved countless lives around the
world. Armed with ultrasonic search gear, video probes which wind
through rubble, and hi-tech cutters, the team have seen action at
disasters in Armenia, Japan, Colombia, Mexico, Turkey, the Philippines,
and El Salvador.
In the stricken area, wisps of smoke spiralled up from where rescuers
cut through sheets of twisted metal, hoping to save people trapped under
tonnes of concrete.
In many places mangled bodies protruded from the ruins, which echoed
to the shouts of residents calling the names of those buried in the town
on the remote Sakhalin Island, 4500 miles and eight time zones east of
Moscow.
The first journalists to reach the area of what authorities believe is
Russia's worst recorded tremor saw rescue workers struggling to find
survivors in the tangled mess that had been home to 3200 people.
An eight-year-old girl was pulled from the ruins two days after the
tremor knocked over her block of flats like a pack of cards.
She looked pale and lifeless in the soft beams of the rescuers'
torches, but when she opened her huge bright blue eyes, they lit up her
face.
As they took her out towards the waiting helicopter, a figure loomed
out of the darkness. ''Get a doctor quickly,'' he snapped.
Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu said 700 rescuers with 38 cranes
were now in the town, where 19 five-storey blocks of flats were
destroyed.
''The work is going along all right. More equipment should be coming
in today,'' he said.
Some survivors complained that there had not been enough rescuers in
the aftermath of the tremor, but there was no doubt the teams were now
under strict instructions to leave no stone unturned.
As the rescuers worked under floodlights through the night, shivering
and dazed survivors slept under the open skies or in tents.
Health Minister Eduard Nechayev told Itar-Tass news agency that the
destruction was even greater than at the site of an Armenian earthquake
which killed 25,000 people in December 1988.
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said rescue work was going
ahead at full pace.
''Unfortunately everything has to be transported by air because roads
and bridges have been destroyed,'' he told Russian Public Television.
Lieutenant-General Nikolai Loktyonov of the Emergencies Ministry said
planes and helicopters were ferrying in food, clothing, and medical
supplies.
However thick ice off Sakhalin meant that a hospital ship would not be
able to reach the disaster site for four days.
Construction Minister Yefim Basin told reporters that Neftegorsk would
not be rebuilt and said survivors would be evacuated to settlements on
south Sakhalin.
Mr Shoigu said 1970s construction in Neftegorsk reflected the belief
prevalent then that the region was not part of an earthquake zone. Later
homes were more strongly built, he said.

Ms Merkel, who had previously opposed the plan, said she agreed that
sinking was the best disposal method in this exceptional case.
The European Parliament, other governments, and environment activists
say tons of toxic and radioactive waste would be left in the rusty hulk.
However Mr Gummer said the disposal would be carried out in accordance
with strict international agreements and would not harm the environment.

Dunedin, Monday
A NEW Zealand man was convicted today of murdering his mother, father,
brother, and two sisters in a case that shocked the country.
A High Court jury in the South Island city of Dunedin found David
Cullen Bain, 23, guilty of the five murders at the family home last
June. He will be sentenced next month.
The bodies, all shot with a rifle, were found in the Dunedin house
after a hysterical Bain telephoned emergency services to say the family
were ''all dead''.
Bain turned pale and collapsed in the dock as the verdict was read to
him.
The three-week trial boiled down to a single question: whether the
killings were committed by David or his father, Robin, whose body was
found in the lounge beside the murder weapon.
Defence counsel Michael Guest had argued there were several plausible
scenarios in which Robin Bain could have killed his family and then
committed suicide.
However prosecutor Bill Wright depicted David Bain as a cold-blooded
executioner and said the evidence proved his guilt beyond reasonable
doubt.
The case provoked fascination in the media because of its horrific
nature and the seeming absence of a motive.
The Bains were an educated, musical, religious family who had lived
for some years in Papua New Guinea, where the parents were missionaries.
Witnesses said David Bain behaved strangely in the weeks before the
murders, telling friends of deja vu experiences and on one occasion
going into a trance at a concert. He was deeply affected by the film
Schindler's List about the Nazi Holocaust.
Wright seized on a crucial piece of David Bain's own testimony, when
he recalled entering the bedroom of his sister Laniet and hearing her
''gurgling''.
A pathologist testified that Laniet would have made such sounds as
blood filled her airways from the first of the three shots that killed
her. Wright concluded only one person could have heard the gurgling, and
that was the murderer.
The massacre revived memories of two similar family killings in 1992
and the random murder of 13 people by a crazed gunman, also near
Dunedin, in 1990.--Reuter.

Hong Kong, Monday
NEARLY half the people of Hong Kong want Britain to withdraw Governor
Chris Patten and replace him with a local council, according to an
opinion poll published by the South China Morning Post.
The survey also showed an increase in those wanting an independent
Hong Kong, due to be handed back to China on July 1, 1997.
Mr Patten, slated to be the last colonial governor, has promised to
stay until then despite a bitter wrangle with Beijing over his plans for
democratic reforms of Hong Kong's legislature.
China has promised to disband the councils elected under the Patten
scheme as soon as it takes over.
According to the poll of 600 people, 48% said Hong Kong would be
better off if Britain allowed local people to run the territory without
a British governor until 1997.
Only 26.9% said Hong Kong would be better off under Mr Patten's
leadership. Just over 13% thought he should be replaced by a new
governor.
The percentage of people wanting Hong Kong to become independent rose
to 22%, up from 15% in March last year.
Only 25% said they favoured Hong Kong becoming a Special
Administrative Region of China, as it will in 1997.
Nevertheless 71% said they were confident about the future, with 65%
saying Hong Kong would be a good place to live after 1997.--Reuter.

Beijing, Monday
A FORMER top Communist Party official urged China's legislature today
to end the current clamp-down on dissent as police rounded up more
activists.
More than 40 dissidents have been detained this month in a sign of
both resurgent activism and government wariness at the approach of the
sixth anniversary on June 4 of the brutal crushing of pro-democracy
demonstrations.
A student whose whose legs were crushed by a tank during the offensive
in Beijing's Tiananmen Square was among six activists taken into
custody, five of them in Haikou on the southern island of Hainan, the
New York-based Human Rights in China reported.
The group was working on a petition criticising official corruption
and the government's branding of the 1989 protests as an anti-government
riot.
Many others interrogated in the past month have petitioned the
government this year, asking for more tolerance of dissent, the release
of political prisoners, and a full account of the 1989 crackdown.
Human Rights in China today issued an appeal written by Lin Mu, a
former secretary to the late pro-reform Communist Party Chief Hu
Yaobang.
In the letter to the heads of the National People's Congress, Lin
protested about the ''extremely intolerant treatment'' of people who
signed a petition two weeks ago.
Lin, one of the signatories, was detained last week in the eastern
city of Hangzhou with four others while drafting the latest appeal.
Police took him back to Xian, the central Chinese city where he lives,
released him on Friday, and told him to stay at home.
The petition also calls for the release of Wang Dan, a leader of the
1989 protests who was arrested again on May 21 and who had earlier
promised to stage a hunger strike if taken into custody.
Among the five detained in Haikou on Friday, three activists from 1989
have not been released, Human Rights in China said.
Fang Zheng, who lost both legs when he was hit by a tank during the
crackdown in Beijing, was freed, but has been been watched and followed
ever since.
Meanwhile, Amnesty International reported that Chinese police had
jailed hundreds of Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns, including dozens of
child novices as young as 12, torturing many to extract confessions.
''Tibetan children accused of political offences have been tortured or
ill-treated, held with adult prisoners, and forced to do hard labour,''
said a report.
It claimed that some prisoners had died of illness in custody or
shortly after being released, including two nuns in their early 20s.
The Himalayan region has been racked by often violent pro-independence
unrest for years and the number of political detainees has soared to 628
at the end of last year, up from about 400 the previous year.
Amnesty attributed the rise in anti-Chinese activities to renewed
restrictions on Buddhist worship in the deeply religious area, including
a ban on photographs of the exiled god-king the Dalai Lama. --AP/Reuter.

Brussels, Monday
TEN fans of the Italian football club Juventus laid a wreath today at
Brussels' Heysel stadium to mark the 10th anniversary of one of the
worst disasters in sporting history.
Belgian television re-screened harrowing images of the tragedy in
which 39 football fans were crushed to death on May 29, 1985 as
thousands panicked after rioting by English fans before a European Cup
final between Liverpool and Juventus.
Most of the dead were Italian. Hundreds were injured in the stampede.
The Italian consulate in Belgium organised a mass in a Brussels church
but despite widespread media coverage of the anniversary, there were no
official Belgian commemorations.
Belgian soccer officials said they were reluctant to revive memories
of the tragedy now that Uefa was due to decide whether to award the 2000
European Championship finals to Belgium and the Netherlands.
The anniversary also passed off quietly in Italy, although Juventus
plan to hold a memorial mass in their home city of Turin on Friday.
The Italian club said they intended to play a friendly match against
Liverpool to mark the occasion.
The only lasting sign of the tragedy is likely to be a commemorative
plaque at the Heysel stadium, which is being redeveloped and will be
renamed the King Baudouin stadium.--Reuter.

Moscow, Monday
MOSCOW'S troops are facing stiff resistance as they gradually push
south to wipe out rebel Chechen fighters, the Kremlin said today.
A Defence Ministry spokesman said the Russians had advanced closer to
the town of Shatoi in the foothills south of the war-wrecked capital
Grozny.
Rebel leaders said the Russian troops had also advanced into hills
overlooking the village of Serzhen-Yurt, boosting Moscow's chances of
taking it.
In Grozny, officials with the Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe said they hoped peace talks broken off last
Thursday would re-open by the end of this week.
Last week's talks were the first real effort by the two sides to
negotiate since Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent his army into
Chechnya last December to end its bid for independence.
The talks broke down without any deal but both sides say they want
them to restart.
Rebels loyal to breakaway leader Dzhokhar Dudayev are heavily
outgunned and outnumbered, and have been forced out of most key parts of
the region, but they have set up bases in the southern
mountains.--Reuter.

ROLLS-ROYCE shop stewards were last night engaged in talks with senior
management over the controversial plan to close the profitable
aero-engine design unit in East Kilbride.
Workers began a series of two-day strikes last month in an effort to
force management to the negotiating table. Rolls-Royce wants to close
the unit with the loss of around 500 jobs and transfer production to
plants at Derby and Bristol.
Last month Derby-based engineering director Mr Eric Betsworth --
charged with achieving a smooth transfer of work south -- insisted that
the company's position was ''not negotiable''.
However, joint unions' committee chairman Mr Owen Thomas said that
management had come to realise the strength of feeling among the East
Kilbride workforce.
Derby and Bristol have already pledged they will not handle any work
transferred south because of the ongoing overtime ban and rolling
programme of strikes, he explained.
The latest talks began on Friday at the East Kilbride plant. They
resumed early yesterday.
Union leaders were unavailable for comment last night, but it is
understood there has been some movement in the management's position
over the transfer plan.
Three weeks ago Rolls-Royce management at East Kilbride withdrew
threats to impose 25 compulsory redundancies. The works convener, Mr
Graham Irvine, said the removal of the redundancy threat reopened a door
for negotiation.
Addressing the management, he added: ''We are hoping they will now
come back to the table with something more worthwhile.''
Last night a source close to the union leaders said: ''It is
encouraging that talks are taking place. But so far we know nothing of
what is being discussed. We will just have to wait and see.''
The strike action has received solid backing from the 500-plus workers
affected. Bosses announced the closure of the plant in January.
Union leaders vowed to fight the plan but held off strike action until
the end of the 90-day consultation period.
No-one from Rolls-Royce was available for comment yesterday.

BRITISH Airways is to boost its workforce by 3000 this summer in
response to a rise in passenger numbers and cargo volumes to record
levels.
The vacancies include permanent, temporary, and part-time
opportunities covering a range of positions from cabin crew to check-in
agents.
News of the recruitment drive comes after the airline experienced its
busiest holiday weekend ever with almost 500,000 passengers.
While most of the jobs are at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, there are
opportunities in Scotland for check-in staff and in the telephone sales
reservation centre in Glasgow.
A spokeswoman said: ''We hope to recruit over 100 staff between the
Scottish airports and our sales reservation centre in Glasgow. This is
in addition to more than 30 cabin crew appointed when we launched our
new service from Glasgow to Boston earlier this year.''

A MEMBER of the Haney family was in court yesterday only days after a
sheriff had branded them a family from hell.
Hughie Haney, 23, was jailed for three months at Stirling Sheriff
Court for threatening to knife a policeman. He admitted being
disorderly, cursing, swearing, and uttering threats in Stirling's King
Street and Stirling police station on Friday evening.
The incident came less than seven hours after Sheriff Norrie Stein
said the Haney clan had brought misery to the Raploch area of Stirling
where they live.
Depute-fiscal Wilma Curtis said the police station incident was
captured on video. Haney, who had been arrested on a drunken binge, told
police officers that the next time he saw them, one of them would be cut
with a knife.
Haney, of Glendevon Drive, Raploch, had no knife with him, but Sheriff
Richard Macfarlane told him the threat was a particularly serious one.
He added that Haney's record included assault and robbery and carrying
offensive weapons. ''It may be that you didn't have anything to carry
out that threat -- but it might be that you intended to carry out that
threat in the future.
''It's one I believe your are capable of carrying out.
''There's an aspect of violence in your disposition, and I cannot
agree that you should be returned immediately to the community.''
The court heard that police were called after members of the public
complained about a disturbance in King Street in the centre of Stirling
at 5.50pm.
Haney, who was with two other men, was drinking whisky. He went wild
when police arrested one of his friends on an outstanding warrant, and
he was taken to the police station.
Mr Ian Angus, the family's solicitor, said Haney's binge had been
prompted by three things -- the birth of a friend's child, the
forthcoming Scottish Cup Final, and Friday's comments by Sheriff Stein,
which had resulted in a large amount of press interest in the family.
He said the incident began as a fairly minor breach of the peace and
had escalated out of all proportion.
He said Haney, who had spent nearly 72 hours in police custody before
appearing yesterday, was worried he would be severely dealt with as a
result of Sheriff Stein's comments.
The court heard that Haney had been released from serving a 10-month
sentence only in February.
Outside the court Haney's mother, Margaret, attacked Sheriff
Mcfarlane's sentence.
She said another accused who admitted charges of breach of the peace
and actually assaulting a police officer had walked from the court on a
deferred sentence only minutes before her son was jailed.
She added that she would be meeting her lawyer today to discuss taking
action about Sheriff Stein's comments.

SCOTS children are paid the most pocket money in Britain, according to
a survey published today.
Unlike youngsters elsewhere who have seen their weekly take fall by an
average 7%, children north of the Border have reaped a rise of up to
22%, the annual TSB pocket money index claims.
Sixteen-year-olds in Scotland have come out best compared to a year
ago. They now get an average #17.90 a week, a rise of #3.20 on last
year.
However, 12-year-olds in Scotland have seen their weekly allowance
drop #1 to #3.90, while 14-year-olds are down 30p to #8.30.
Scottish youngsters get an average #10.80 a week, compared to #9.40 in
the south of England and #8 in the Midlands.
The survey of 626 youngsters aged between 12 and 16 found that
nationally pocket money had been cut by an average 7% in the last year.
However, it also reveals that many children claim they are
underworked, over-indulged, and have an easier life than their parents,
in spite of their pocket money being cut by up to a third.
The index found that 79% of children said they could do more to earn
their money. Nine in ten said they were pampered by their parents,
claiming they got what they wanted, when they wanted it, and 88% said
they had an easier life than their parents.
Despite the pay cuts, children believe the amount of pocket money they
get is correct.
Psychologist David Lewis, who monitored the results, said: ''This is
one of those reluctant thank-you notes you get from young people. There
is no doubt kids these days are well off. But saying so themselves means
they realise that not everyone is doing as well as they are.
''They appreciate they are being looked after by parents who maybe
don't have as much spare cash these days. And they are saying they are
more than happy with their lot.''

A RAIL pressure group pitched tents on a Highland railway platform
last night to protest at train timetable changes.
The demonstration was organised by the Friends of the Far North Line,
who on Sunday night boarded a London-bound sleeper with parts of a car
to show their opposition to British Rail's decision to axe Motorail
services.
About 10 members of the 130-strong group took part in the tent event
at the unmanned Dingwall Station.
From yesterday the last Inverness-Thurso train left at 4.45pm instead
of 6pm. The group claims this virtually prevents rail travellers from
the south of England reaching the far north of Scotland in a day.
Group founder member Frank Roach said the changes would deter people
from travelling and hit tourism.
On Sunday the group took car wheels, a radiator, steering wheel, and
bumper on to the London-bound sleeper to highlight the removal of
Motorail services.

THE Fife village where Scottish world champion driver Jim Clark was
born is set to pay tribute to its most famous son after a 15 year
fund-raising campaign.
Sculptor David Annand hopes his full-size bronze will correct the
popular misconception that the twice world champion was a Borderer, when
in fact he was born in the tiny Fife hamlet of Kilmany.
Clark's association with the Borders came because during his career he
was based at Eddington Mains Farm, Chirnside. The Jim Clark Museum is
situated in nearby Duns.
David Annand was first approached to carve a sculpture 15 years ago by
locals, who remembered Clark as a youngster, playing in a toy racing car
on his father's farm, Wester Kilmany.
More than #16,000 has now been raised for the tribute, with a large
donation coming from the Ford Motor Company. The sculpture is now
complete and will be cast in bronze within the next month.
Clark would have been 60 next March, which is the most likely date for
the official unveiling of the statue.
Clark's brillant racing career came to a premature end when he was
killed in a crash on Germany's Hockenheim circuit during a Formula Two
race in April 1968.

<HEADLINE>Study challenges link with poverty. Juvenile crime soared during 'golden era'</HEADLINE>

CRIME by young people rose dramatically even when Britain was going
through a boom in living standards, according to a new study that
challenges the suggested link between poverty, bad conditions and rising
crime.
The biggest study into juvenile behaviour since the war, by an
international team of psychiatrists, criminologists and education
experts, was carried out in Europe and the USA.
It found that as teenagers enjoyed better conditions their behaviour
got worse with more cases of depression, suicide, drinking and drug
abuse.
The study, headed by Sir Michael Rutter, professor and head of child
and adolescent psychiatry at the London Institute of Psychiatry, and
Professor David Smith, of the criminology department at Edinburgh
University, also shows that as psycho-social disorders were increasing
physical health was improving.
This is a key finding since it expressly divorces the rise in crime
from deteriorating living conditions. Sir Michael said at a press
conference launching their book, Psychological Disorders in Young
People, that it was the first major study to ''highlight the upward
trend in psycho-social disorders of youth across the most developed
countries since the Second World War. It is striking that this increase
in psycho-social disorders happened at a time when physical health was
improving''.
Professor Smith added that it was also striking that this major
increase happened in the ''golden era'' of low unemployment and rising
living standards between 1950 and 1973 showing that increasing
psycho-social disorders were not related to deprivation or to increasing
affluence in any simple way.
The researchers say: ''The poor, the unemployed and people living on
sink estates are more likely to be criminal, depressed, suicidal and
addicted to drugs than those in more comfortable circumstances. Yet
worsening living conditions cannot account for rising levels of crime,
suicide, depression, alcohol and drug abuse in young people because the
rise was most marked during a period of two or three decades in which
living conditions improved.''
To reinforce this finding they say that between 1950 and 1973 there
was a ''golden era'' of economic growth, low unemployment and improved
living conditions throughout the developed world. This coincided with
the post-war rise in psychological disorders. Also, high unemployment in
the 1930s was not associated with rises in crime, suicide or drug abuse.
The study was set up by an association of European scholars, Academia
Europaea, and funded by a Swiss foundation.
The preamble states that while public debate has been dominated by
discussion of economic change the study shows that in the meantime
remarkable social and psychic changes, not related to economic change in
any simple way, have been taking place.
Among the key findings are that alcohol consumption and its related
problems, illicit drug use and drug dependency, suicide rates among
young men and depressive disorders, all increased in Western European
countries since 1950. They concluded, after research, that these
increases were not artificial results of the way the disorders were
measured.
The study adds: ''Increasing levels of family discord and break up may
well have played a role in the rise in psychological disorders. There is
strong evidence that family conflict and bad parenting increase the risk
that children will later develop disorders.
''But we cannot be certain that the rise in divorce means more family
conflict and bad parenting. Instead, it could reflect an increasing
refusal to put up with serious marital difficulties.''
Turning to the causes of disorder, the report says that the changing
nature of adolescence may be among the causes.
''Children now reach puberty earlier and take longer to reach adult
status by finishing their education and getting a job. Young people have
become more isolated from the rest of society with their own music,
dress and culture.
''They value independence more but remain financially dependent on
their parents for longer,'' the researchers find, adding that they may
be more stressed by early sexual experience and the break-up of loving
relationships.
The study absolves the mass media as the root cause in the increase in
psycho-social disorder, although it may magnify the effects of social
change.

A REBELLION by thousands of small shareholders in British Gas,
masterminded by a St Andrews University professor, will be taken
straight to the high-earning company chiefs at their annual general
meeting in London tomorrow.
Furious shareholders have mobilised and organised themselves to
protest against salary pay-outs to top executives and the way the
company treats its customers and staff.
At least 7000 angry shareholders are expected to attend the meeting,
which is predicted to be one of the most eventful and well-attended in
British corporate history.
Professor Joe Lamb, 66, a part-time lecturer in physiology, has been
thrust into the spotlight as the small shareholders group leader, after
receiving proxy votes for the meeting from 800 shareholders who own a
total of half a million shares.
He said that ordinary people who bought a small amount of shares after
privatisation were ashamed to have them and angry at the way the company
was being run.
He said a retired wing commander based at RAF Leuchers, an investment
banker and two knights of the realm, all of whom he refused to name, had
written with their support. Twelve doctors, lawyers, and pensioners have
also enlisted to the campaign.
While accepting the strength of London-based institutions meant it
would be impossible for them to win crucial votes against the board,
Professor Lamb said he was looking for a moral victory. The 14-strong
board would be rattled by the reception they would receive at the
meeting, he said.
The 7000 small shareholders he expected to attend the meeting at the
London Arena to voice their disgust, compares with just 800 who attended
the same event last year.
Professor Lamb, of Cupar, Fife, said: ''Many people have said they
wanted to complain about what was going on and didn't know how to go
about it.''
There are two resolutions put to the AGM of interest to the small
shareholders. The first resolution, lodged by Professor Lamb, deals with
issues relating to the interests of consumers, shareholders, and
employees while the other deals with executive remuneration.
Professor Lamb's resolution calls for an advisory group including
shareholders and members of the Gas Consumer Council to be set up to
interview the chief executive, Mr Cedric Brown, and chairman of British
Gas, Mr Richard Giordano, not less than three times a year to help
prepare a report on the company for future AGM's.
The other resolution proposed by the London-based Pensions Investment
Research Consultants calls on the board of British Gas to revise its
remuneration policy for executives.
Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond will represent by proxy
1500 people with around three-quarters of a million shares at the
meeting. Mr Salmond will travel to London in a bus full of
Scottish-based British Gas shareholders which leaves Edinburgh for
London this evening.
He said: ''The fundamental issue to be addressed is whether British
Gas operates as an energy utility or as just another international oil
and gas company. The shareholders are in no doubt that -- although
privatised -- British Gas is still a utility and should behave like one.
''Our key objection is to win the show of hands on our resolution on
pay and the interests of consumers, shareholders and employees at the
AGM. Such a victory would have enormous symbolic importance and not just
in relation to British Gas. It would send a message throughout the City
of London signalling that the days of fat cat greed are coming to an
end.''
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said he too would be
attending the meeting with a proxy vote. He said soaring consumer
complaints, which almost doubled in the first three months of this year,
mirrored cuts in consumer services like the closure of 160 gas showrooms
and the axing of important workers like 50 home service advisers who
helped elderly and disabled customers.
It is believed that British Gas may try to deflect some of the flak
thrown at them by announcing that customers who pay their gas bills
promptly will receive a discount from their next quarterly bill, thought
to be around #2.

A SCOTTISH MP yesterday demanded a Government investigation into a
five-hour shutdown of a mobile telephone network, which left some
doctors unable to receive emergency calls.
Labour trade and industry spokesman Brian Wilson also called for a
stricter code of practice governing network operators after the Cellnet
cellular phone system was shut down in Scotland and Northern Ireland,
between 2am and 7am on Saturday, for planned maintenance work to be
carried out.
He claimed the shutdown was made without advance warning -- with
doctors who routinely have emergency calls diverted to their portable
phones unable to take calls.
Mr Wilson, MP for Cunninghame North, said that when people tried to
call a portable telephone they got the engaged tone. He added that the
shutdown would have affected other people who rely on mobile phones for
emergency calls, such as emergency drivers.
He has written to the President of the Board of Trade, Michael
Heseltine, asking for urgent guidelines to all telephone network
operators, insisting that reasonable steps should be taken to notify
users of planned breaks in service.
He said: ''This is taking deregulation too far. One can hardly imagine
BT shutting down its network for five hours without telling anyone, yet
mobile phones have become just as much of a lifeline for many users.
''All utility providers are well accustomed to the idea of advertising
planned withdrawals of service, even if it is only for a few hours. It
is quite irresponsible to leave people, who might be involved in an
emergency, with no service and no explanation.''
Mr Wilson said he had been informed of at least one emergency call
which was missed by a doctor, whose surgery phone is diverted to a
Cellnet number, as a result of the close-down.
He added that the emergency link for stranded motorists was also
withdrawn throughout Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Cellnet, which has one million customers throughout Britain and an
estimated 100,000 in Scotland, yesterday confirmed there had been a
five-hour shutdown, but claimed it was unlikely to have had any impact
on emergency calls.
A spokesman said the shutdown happened when technical work which had
been expected to take an hour was prolonged by the cellular equivalent
of an telephone exchange ''crash''.
A total of 9000 calls had been ''lost'' by the shutdown, Cellnet said.
It defended its policy of not advertising maintenance work in advance,
saying the total network down-time for all regions added together was
less than one day in a year.
''If we advertised every time we were doing some maintenance, it would
be like crying wolf the whole time,'' a spokesman said.
It was ''very unusual'' for doctors to rely solely on portable phones
for receiving out-of-hours emergency calls, and most used combinations
of bleepers, portable phones, answering services and fixed phones.

A BID to reopen the troubled dairy blamed for a fatal food poisoning
outbreak will be made tomorrow by the teenage daughter of the owners.
Miss Alix Haston, 19, daughter of Redhouse Dairy owners Robert and
Margaret Haston, has applied to West Lothian District Council for a
pasteurisation licence to set up business on the premises in Blackburn,
West Lothian.
A child, 18-month-old Claire Davison, from Bathgate, died from the E
coli 0157 bug last May while 60 others were struck down. Two youngsters
will need kidney transplants.
Her father's licence was cancelled in December. He has appealed to the
Secretary of State.
Miss Haston, a university student, was not available for comment
yesterday. Her mother, denying she was behind the move, said: ''My dairy
has been closed for the last year.
''My daughter is going to have to pay herself through university. Alix
is going into business on her own.''
She denied that her daughter was too young or inexperienced to operate
a dairy business.
Mr and Mrs Haston were each fined #1000 in March at Linlithgow Sheriff
Court after being found guilty of distributing milk that was unfit for
human consumption.
The council's environmental health committee will consider Miss
Haston's application tomorrow. Officials have recommended refusal
although they admitted Miss Haston has completed a business
administration course and holds a food hygiene certificate.

A TWO-year-old boy was yesterday found wandering naked on a busy
Edinburgh road blowing kisses at passing cars.
Callum North brought traffic on Duke Street to a standstill after he
escaped from his second floor Easter Road flat while his mother was
sleeping.
It is thought his mother, Brenda, had come in late the night before
and had failed to secure the door properly after letting the babysitter
out.
He was picked up by police, who two hours later managed to track down
his frantic mother at her flat a quarter of a mile away.
The boy managed to unlock the door of the flat, make his way down the
stairs, and unlock the communal security door at the front of the
building.
He then wandered 400 yards down Easter Road before being found.
A police spokesman said: ''Obviously when he woke up and saw the sun
shining he thought it was time to get going.
''But his mum had only come in late the night before and was sound
asleep, so he decided to go for a walk on his own.
''When we found him he seemed happy and undisturbed by the experience.
He was very clean and tidy so we figured he had not walked very far.
''Luckily door to door inquiries proved successful, although when we
found his mother she was in a frantic state.
''He was lucky he did not come to any harm but he seemed a very smart
kid.''
Ms North spoke of her horror of waking up to find Callum gone and the
front door open.
She said: ''He has a wee truck that he stood on to reach the lock of
the front. Somehow he managed to reach up and unlock then open the door.
0 ''I could not believe it when I saw what had happened. I was in a
terrible state and I'm still getting over it.
''All I can think of is how very, very lucky we are. We had a lucky
escape and things could have been so much worse.
''Anything could have happened and I'll be keeping a strict eye on him
from now on.''

THE director of the investment arm of Scottish Amicable yesterday
sought to explain why the company had decided not to take any further
part in a bid to recover more than #4m lost by shareholders when a
Glasgow-based motor insurer collapsed.
About 150 former shareholders have formed an action group and enlisted
the help of Mr Tom Benyon, a former Tory MP who championed the cause of
some Lloyd's names, to recover losses incurred when the Diamond Group
breakdown insurance company crashed in October, 1989, just six months
after its high-profile #4.4m flotation.
Action group members have expressed ''surprise and disappointment''
that Scottish Amicable, which lost about #900,000 in the collapse, has
decided not to pursue its claim against parties claimed to be negligent
in connection with the collapse.
They have also levelled criticisms at Scottish Amicable after it was
confirmed that a leading London and Scottish stockbroker, Mr Bernard
Solomons, is to become the new non-executive chairman of Scottish
Amicable Investment Managers.
He currently chairs the Glasgow-based stockbroker Allied Provincial
Securities Ltd, which is among the parties being sued by the Diamond
Action Group.
The private shareholders will be pursuing an action jointly with
Postel, managers of the Post Office and BT pension fund.
Postel, a major shareholder, is suing Mr Derek Diamond and Mr Clive
Miller, directors of the Diamond Group, and the group's professional
advisers at the time of its launch on the unlisted securities market,
which include Allied Provincial and Glasgow-based accountants Arthur
Andersen.
Mr Solomons's post with Scottish Amicable Investment Managers will
carry a director's fee. It is understood he will also make a substantial
profit if an estimated #18m planned takeover deal of Allied Provincial
by the London finance house King &amp; Shaxson proceeds.
Mr Douglas Ferrans, UK Equity Director of Scottish Amicable Investment
Managers, yesterday insisted there was nothing sinister in his company's
decision not to support the Diamond Action Group.
''It had nothing to do with the appointment of Mr Solomons but was
only taken after seeking independent legal advice. We had several
meetings with Mr Benyon but were advised that the matter would not be
worth pursuing given the additional expense likely to be incurred in
pursuing the claim.
''Our lawyers were not aware that Mr Solomons was a director of Allied
Provincial or that he was soon to take up a non-executive role as
chairman of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers when we consulted
them,'' Mr Ferrans said.
Mr Benyon, a director of the Society of Names, who earlier this year
played a key part in the largest action ever fought in the civil court
which is expected to result in a #300m settlement for Lloyd's names,
yesterday described Scottish Amicable's reluctance to participate in the
Diamond Group action as ''extraordinary''.
However, he said remained confident of a ''successful outcome'' to the
court action in favour of Diamond shareholders.
Mr Ferrans warned that the action group was entering into ''unexplored
territory'' where ''the chances of success are not high'' in what was
believed to be the first class action of its kind outside the Lloyd's
market.
The Scottish Amicable Investment Managers chief added: ''You don't
always get what you claim even if you do win. We do not believe there is
a compelling argument for proceeding further.''
Mr Solomons could not be contacted for comment yesterday.

<HEADLINE>Bizarre case of a Mexican art theft and a 'most-wanted' bicycle repair man from Orkney. Interpol trail that led to a bike shed.</HEADLINE>

IT WAS the classic Mexican standoff -- on the remote Scottish island
of Hoy in Orkney.
Police had their man, Paul Tiney, under lock and key in Chihuahua,
Mexico, for allegedly stealing works of art by Goya and Van Gogh and for
planning to snatch a #26m ancient golden Inca death mask from a local
museum.
But when they arrived to collect evidence at his croft at Spindrift,
Longhope, Hoy, imagine their surprise when they were met by -- Paul
Tiney.
Yesterday Mr Tiney, 42, said he would like it to be known that he is
no globe-trotting master art-thief, but just an ordinary bike repair man
trying to go about his lawful business on Hoy.
He said: ''I am no arch-criminal. I have only ever had one conviction
and that was for a minor motoring offence. So who is in jail in Mexico?
As you can see, it is not me. The police got quite a shock when they
found me here.''
The standoff came about after Mr Tiney, who has lived in Orkney for
six years after giving up his bike shop in Wrexham, Wales, took
advantage of a cheap BA flight to go on holiday to Mexico.
Things went well until he decided to cross the border for a day-trip
into Texas ''just to say I had been there''. On the way back the US
border guards decided to search him and found his diary.
He said: ''I had made a sketch of a rotary engine for some motorbike
enthusiasts in Mexico. The immigration boys must have thought it was an
alarm system.
''I had noted down some ancient Mexican numerals which are provided
for you at the museum so that you can follow the exhibits. They must
have thought it was something to do with the golden death mask.''
Mr Tiney had also written that he had been to see the pyramids. He
said: ''I had -- but it was the Mexican ones. But, to them, it meant I
had visited Egypt -- where I had never been -- and that made me into a
globe-trotter.
''There is no other explanation. It has all gone haywire. It is
bizarre. They gave me a grilling for two hours and then let me go, but
it is quite clear that the immigration people got on the telephone and
then my name went on the computer files.''
When he got home he wrote a stiff letter to the US Immigration Service
about his treatment. The next thing he knew, the police were at his
doorstep.
He added: ''Their information is that I was arrested and jailed on May
5. I was on a 19-hour long ferry journey in Mexico at the time of the
so-called arrest.
''I am worried that someone who fits my description has been jailed
just because he looks like me -- and I am very concerned about problems
that could arise if I ever go abroad again.''
He said that the Interpol computer had his name on its ''most-wanted''
list along with terrorists and top criminals. ''It is just not good
enough.
''I have been to the American Embassy and they put me in touch with
the FBI, who said they are going to look into it and get back to me.
That was last week and I have heard nothing more.''
A spokesman at Northern Constabulary HQ in Inverness said: ''The
Metropolitan Police contacted us and we sent officers from Kirkwall to
Mr Tiney's home at their request. There was no arrest.''
The Metropolitan Police in London said it was not really a matter for
them to discuss, but would imagine that they made the request to
Northern Constabulary because Interpol had contacted them.
An American Embassy spokesman in London said: ''We are looking into
this matter. There is a humorous aspect, but not if you are involved. I
am not surprised that Mr Tiney is a bit nonplussed.''
At Interpol spokesperson confirmed that Paul Tiney's name was on their
file.
When asked who is in jail in Mexico, the spokesman said: ''This is an
interesting case and we will have to look into it.''

<HEADLINE>Collectors steal eggs from sixth Osprey nest</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EGG collectors have stolen from another of Scotland's Osprey nests,
bringing the total number of sites attacked so far this year to six.
The latest theft was discovered by officers from the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds at the weekend.
The nest on Speyside is close to the Loch Garten nature reserve where
one egg at a nest site hatched on Sunday morning. It is hoped the
remaining two eggs will hatch later this week.
RSPB officials have described the theft as sickening. Just two weeks
ago they blamed a group of egg collectors from the English Midlands for
the wilful destruction of three nests on Speyside and in Perthshire.
The latest setback follows forecasts by RSPB chiefs in Scotland that
the Ospreys were set to enjoy their best breeding season here in 250
years.
Ironically, it is because of the Ospreys' success story in Scotland
that protection of sites is now virtually impossible as there are over a
hundred pairs nesting here.
RSPB spokesman David Minns said last night he was ''very angry'' at
the continued persecution of the birds by a selfish minority obsessed
with their hobby.
He said: ''I was delighted with the good news from the RSPB's nature
reserve at Loch Garten, but sickened that egg collectors are continuing
to persecute Ospreys.
''A few selfish individuals are holding back the return of this
beautiful and harmless bird and, in doing so, are depriving the public
of a magnificent part of our natural heritage.''

A BUSINESSMAN who sacked his staff and told them to park five crane
lorries outside his ex-wife's home in a bitter divorce row has sold the
company to his workers for #1.
Mr Nigel Lambert, 36, said divorce payments became too much so he
wound up his business, Gazewing Plant Ltd, making staff redundant, and
left its assets -- the five lorries -- with his wife Caroline.
A last duty for drivers was to take the lorries and park them outside
Mr Lambert's former marital home in Little Oxley, near West Malling,
Kent.
Mr Lambert, of Dover, said: ''I offered Caroline a salary of
#18,000-a-year to do nothing and our #150,000 four-bedroom detached
house.
''But that wasn't enough, and she wanted me to pay her #15,000 legal
fees as well, so I sacked all the staff, and gave her the company as
well.
''But it seems she doesn't want that either, so I have done the next
best thing and let the people who bust a gut helping me build it up to
take it over.''
Former manager Barney Dixon, 32, is now a director. He said plans
would be made today to move the lorries.

A 36-year-old untried prisoner on remand for alleged assault and
robbery has been found hanged in a cell at Barlinnie Prison.
A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death of Mr David
Carlin, of Glasgow, remanded from Glasgow Sheriff Court, whose body was
found when cells were unlocked at 6.30am on Monday.
Last year suicides in Scottish jails rose to 16, leading to a review
of suicide prevention strategy. That inquiry by Professor John Gunn, of
London University, one of the UK's leading forensic psychiatrists, is
expected to report in the autumn.
Both the prison and the Scottish Prison Service face criticism over
such cell deaths when the determination of Sheriff Eric Galt, who
earlier this month concluded the evidence in a fatal accidents inquiry
into three bedsheet hangings in Barlinnie, becomes public in the coming
weeks.
The inquiry heard that three men -- John Grant, 50, of Grangemouth,
Alan Scot, 24, of Falkirk and William Halford, 43, of Motherwell --
should have been on suicide prevention observation at Barlinnie before
their deaths last year but, because of an error, were not.
At that inquiry the prison's deputy governor, Mrs Kate Donegan, 42,
said an internal inquiry had disclosed that, although doctors had
recommended that all three be placed under observation and be given
medication, the records ordering this were not transferred to prison
officers.

A FIRE in a cleansing department garage early yesterday is thought to
have caused damage amounting to #1m.
The premises, owned by Eastwood District Council, and the entire fleet
of 17 vehicles were destroyed.
The council has warned residents that services such as refuse
collections may be disrupted.
Detectives investigating the blaze, which took firefighters 90 minutes
to bring under control, are treating it as suspicious. A report is to be
submitted to the procurator-fiscal.
The outbreak in the single storey garage at the council's premises in
Rouken Glen Park, Eastwood, Glasgow, started at 3.55am and destroyed
rubbish uplift vehicles, road-sweepers, pavement sweepers, and general
purpose vehicles.
Local residents were woken when the vehicles' tyres exploded.
Forensic examinations were being carried out yesterday, but the police
said they had not yet established the cause of the fire.
The council is to receive assistance from neighbouring Renfrew
District Council and is hiring vehicles from a private contractor in a
bid to maintain normal services.
Services, which comprise four daily rounds in different parts of the
district, usually start on a Monday in Eaglesham, Muirend, Williamwood,
and Merrylee, but were not due to have started until today because of
the public holiday.
Chief executive, Mr Michael Henry, who described the #1m estimate of
damage costs as reasonable, said yesterday: ''The normal collection
routes will be followed but there will inevitably be delays. We run a
back-door collection service but in some parts of the district people
put garden refuse on the kerbside.
''We are asking them not to put any refuse out without checking with
the council when the uplift will take place.
''Someone will be available to deal with telephone enquiries on
638-1101.''
Mr Henry added that he could not estimate when the vehicles would be
replaced as the matter had to be discussed with the council's insurers.
The police, who were alerted when the depot's fire alarm was
activated, have appealed for any witnesses to contact them.

ORKNEY should be served by two daily complementary ferry services from
the mainland, says the islands council.
One should be for passengers, cars and commercial vehicles, running
between Stromness and Scrabster, the other for freight and livestock,
plying between Kirkwall and Invergordon.
This is the key demand contained in tender specifications for lifeline
shipping services prepared by the council.
The Government recently announced that it is to put these services out
to tender, advertising them in the Journal of the European Commission
''as soon as possible''.
The council set up a working party after the Government's announcement
in September that it was to remove the subsidy for freight to Orkney and
Shetland. This group subsequently agreed that the council should be
closely involved in the tendering process and produced the specification
which will go before the full council next month.
Council vice-convener Mr Jim Sinclair, who chaired the working group,
said yesterday: ''The Government withdrew freight subsidies without
listening to the Orkney community. It is now drawing up its own
specifications for Orkney's lifeline services and we are saying that
those who depend on these services, the Orkney people, must be involved
in this process.''
He added: ''There is some evidence in the Western Isles that the
demise of bulk shipment there is forcing more bulk cargoes on to the
main ro-ro ferry service. This is imposing strains on that service and
additional costs on shippers. This evidence adds weight to our argument
that we must have two separate but complementary services.''

AN owner whose dog accidentally knocked down and disabled a
66-year-old woman was not to blame for the accident, a sheriff decided
yesterday.
At the time of the accident Sally, a golden retriever, was 13 months
old, 2ft high, weighing 60lb, and was ''lively and frisky''. On the
morning of December 4, 1990, she was being taken for a walk by Mr John
Carruthers.
They were in the same field in Roslin as Mrs Fairlie, who was walking
her nine-year-old bearded collie, when Sally collided with Mrs Fairlie,
who fell breaking a bone in her knee.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court, Mrs Fairlie, of Rosabella Road, sued Mr
Carruthers, 56, of Pentland View Crescent, both Roslin, claiming that,
although not deliberately or viciously, Sally had ''attacked or
harried'' her and that, as Sally's keeper, Mr Carruthers was to blame.
There was also a claim that Mr Carruthers was negligent because he
failed to keep Sally properly under control.
However, Sheriff Andrew Bell did not think that what Sally did could
be described as attacking or harrying Mrs Fairlie.
In his written judgment, issued yesterday, he also exonerated Mr
Carruthers as there was nothing which should have made him wary that
Sally might act dangerously and knock someone down.
He said that, if Mrs Fairlie had won her case, he could have awarded
#3600 for loss of earnings and #9000 for pain and suffering. However, he
ruled that Mr Carruthers did not have to pay damages. He also ordered
Mrs Fairlie to pay the expenses of the court action.
Mrs Fairlie needed a graft in her knee which involved a plate and
screws.
Since the accident she has had to use a stick and cannot walk more
than half a mile. Her ability to do housework is restricted and she has
difficulty driving.
Mrs Fairlie, now 71, worked as a tourist guide at Roslyn Chapel in the
summer, but had to give up the job.

SCOTLAND'S football manager, Craig Brown, yesterday endorsed a new
council sports policy which could help find football stars of the
future.
Mr Brown told Lothian Regional Council leaders he welcomed plans for a
school of excellence for teenagers who excel at team games like football
and rugby.
At the same time it was announced that the region is to try to forge
new rugby sporting links with black school pupils in South Africa.
The region's education committee chairman, Mrs Elizabeth Maginnis,
said Ritchie Dixon, currently in South Africa helping to coach the
Scottish team, was making the first step towards such links.

SIX soldiers from the Royal Welch Fusiliers captured by Bosnian Serbs
were last night recovering from injuries they suffered when their
armoured personnel carrier plunged 200ft off a mountain road down a
ravine.
The men were hurt on Sunday night when, according to an ITN report,
they tried to escape. They were last night recovering in a hospital in
Sokolac, 22 miles from the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ''Our position is quite clear.
These men are being detained against their will and should be returned
as soon as possible.''
They were named as as David John Jones, Martin Williams, Ian Smith,
Laurence Parry, Steven McCabe, and Jonathan Richardson, all from Wales.
The Serbs said the men were in stable and uncritical condition.
Mr Parry said: ''We were not told we were taken prisoners of war, we
were just told to move to a safe place.''
He was driving the APC and broke his right arm in the accident when
the backwheels of his vehicle slid off the road.
Mr McCabe said: ''I was very scared. Our officer told us to calm down
and that, as long as we don't shoot anyone, we'll be okay.''

OIL fields west of the Shetland Islands are an exciting prospect
waiting to be exploited and extended, Scottish Office Industry Minister
George Kynoch said yesterday.
Speaking in Glasgow at the opening of the annual conference of the
European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers, he said that
speeding up the latest round of licence applications meant that more
than 1700 square kilometres in the area would be surveyed this summer.
As for the North Sea, he pointed out that while it had entered a
mature stage in its development, with smaller fields now being
developed, there was now far more co-operation among the oil companies
to ensure that profits would still flow.
''A new mood of co-operation has emerged and, for example, it can be
seen in joint seismic surveys over adjacent blocks rather than
individual surveys,'' he said.
He added: ''Another project which will have enormous impact on the
industry is the Common Data Access Initiative. Through it UK operators
have pooled their geological data for the whole of the United Kingdom
Continental Shelf.
''Subscribers to the data pool will have, in the future, quick access
to the latest high quality digital and hard copy data from a single
source. The potential savings to be made over the next few years are
quite substantial. This can only been seen as good news for the
industry.''
More than 4000 people, mainly oil industry specialists, are attending
the conference at the SECC.
During the week-long event there will be nearly 600 technical
presentations, many of which will focus on the future technology
required to exploit oil and gas resources.

FOR more than two centuries the beam from Kinnaird Head lighthouse
guided seafarers to safety until it was finally dimmed in 1991.
Now, however, the sparkle has returned to the lighthouse and this week
it will be reborn, guiding tourists through the history of lighthouses
and their keepers.
Lighthouse keepers are a dying breed, with automation leaving only a
dozen in Britain, all of them in Scotland. By the end of the century
none will be left, but their memory will be kept alive by Scotland's
Lighthouse Museum which has cost #1.5m to establish and is the only
museum of its kind in mainland Britain.
Kinnaird Head was the first lighthouse operated by the Northern
Lighthouse Board in 1787. It was built on top of a sixteenth-century
castle from where its light shone for 204 years.
When the last keepers left, the local museums service moved in and
labelled every item. When the museum opens on Thursday the public will
be able to see the lighthouse exactly as it was when it closed.
Visitors will be able to climb the 72 steps to the top of the tower
and enjoy the magnificent views over the Moray Firth and Fraserburgh
harbour from the balcony on which the keepers cleaned the lighthouse
glass.
The mueseum has been funded by the regional and district councils as
well as Grampian Enterprise and Historic Scotland.
The centrepiece of the museum complex is the 40ft high light, along
with its mechanism, which shone out from Sanda, near Kintyre.
Lit and turning its brass, clockwork, and polished mirrors are
testimony to Victorian engineering and the care and dedication of the
keepers.
In the ground-floor display there are numerous other huge mirrors and
lenses from Scottish lighthouse history.
The museum also tells the story of the Stevenson family who, for many
generations, were engineers to the Northern Lighthouse Board and built
many of Scotland's most famous lights from Muckle Flugga to the Mull of
Galloway.
The best known of these builders was Robert Stevenson who tamed the
deadly Bell Rock off Arbroath, by constructing a lighthouse there in
1815.
Mr Richard Townsley has come from the English Civil War Museum in
Worcester to be the manager of the museum and hopes to attract 21,000
visitors in the first 10 months of opening.
The complex includes an audio-visual display where visitors will be
given a 10 minute guide to the key developments in lighthouses and a
cafeteria.
The museum is one of the flagship tourist attractions being
established along the North-east coast in an effort to persuade visitors
not to bypass the area en route to Inverness.

POLICE hunting the man who abandoned a one-hour-old baby boy at
Edinburgh's Eastern General Hospital on Friday night, say security
cameras have proved useless in the inquiry.
Officers examined footage from cameras at the hospital, but the man
was not caught on film.
Police appeals for the mystery man have produced a poor response. They
stress they are concerned for the mother's well-being and have urged
friends and relatives not to shield her.
The man, who called himself Ian Young, said the baby's mother was
called Michelle and had three other children. She could not cope with
another child and he asked for the baby to be cared for and adopted.
A police spokesman said: ''The man had dirty finger nails. He could be
someone that works with his hands, a labourer or manual worker.''
Cards and toys have been arriving for the boy, named Fraser by nurses,
who was abandoned at the hospital in a hold-all.
A hospital spokesman said: ''The baby is healthy and is being looked
after by hospital staff. He will remain here for the foreseeable
future.''

<HEADLINE>Former Premier believes sending more UK troops could lead to full-scale war in Bosnia. Heath warns against escalation</HEADLINE>

FORMER Tory Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath warned yesterday that
full-scale war in Bosnia could become inevitable following the decision
to send more British troops to the area.
As Ministers lined up in a show of British resolve, Sir Edward blamed
the hostage-taking on UN air strikes against Serb positions and called
for an immediate end to further bombing to protect lives on both sides.
Sir Edward, who may reinforce his arguments in tomorrow's special
debate in the recalled Parliament, said the Government had been warned
repeatedly of the potential dangers of allowing British troops to become
embroiled in the Bosnian peace-keeping mission.
He said on BBC radio: ''It started as a humanitarian action that was
justifiable, but now we are facing a situation where we may be dragged
into a major war and that is absolutely unjustifiable.
''I do not believe it is possible for the UN or us as individual
powers to impose our will on those people without having a major war and
that means a loss of life for everyone.
''This is the outcome of the bombing. We have warned against the
bombing -- the pressure came from the United States -- but bombing was
bound to cause great loss of life which was unnecessary and also lead to
this sort of situation.''
The former Prime Minister called on the European Union Foreign
Ministers, meeting in Brussels to discuss the worsening crisis, to
deliver the blunt message to UN headquarters that there was no question
of European troops becoming involved in a wider conflict.
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said it was vital that the UN
mandate in Bosnia was now redefined to take account of the role to be
played by the new troops.
''The immediate focus of Britain must be on our troops who are most at
risk. It is very important if we are going to get those hostages out --
and get them out unscathed -- that we do show we are not going to back
down,'' he said.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, who described the taking of the
hostages as ''an act of barbarism'', urged the military and diplomats to
work together.
He said: ''At the end of the day the vital thing is that the
international community is seen to act together and the Serbs are seen
to understand that if they provoke then we respond in kind.''
Tory MP David Howell, chairman of the back-bench Foreign Affairs
Select Committee, called for a two-pronged approach combining diplomacy
with the threat of force, but took a relatively hard line on use of the
latter.
He said: ''There must be a big stick, or signs that a big stick is
waiting in the wings. In the meantime it is up to the commanders on the
spot to see whether they can get sense into the Bosnian Serbs' heads to
make them realise that if they carry on they will bring down on
themselves retribution on a scale far greater than anything they have so
far imagined.''
He said the first concern of the Government and of MPs was to get our
hostages out unharmed and then to prevent further hostages being taken
by doing something about the situation in which British troops and those
of other countries were so exposed.
Tomorrow's recall of Parliament will be only the 13th since the Second
World War and reflects the gravity with which Ministers view
developments in Bosnia.
The last time was in September, 1992, during the economic chaos which
saw the pound forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism, and
Lady Thatcher twice ordered recalls as the Government prepared to send
British troops to war.
In September, 1990, the House sanctioned the use of force to expel the
troops of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, and on a dramatic
Saturday in April, 1982, MPs debated the invasion of the Falkland
Islands by Argentina.

Brussels
EUROPE'S Foreign Ministers warned the Bosnian Serbs last night that
they must release the UN hostages ''immediately and unconditionally'' or
face the consequences.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd also made it clear the peacekeeping
force would not, for now at least, be withdrawn.
He refused to go into details about what was being done to free the
hostages. ''There are constant efforts to secure their release,'' he
said, adding that there was good reason for not saying more.
He was speaking after briefing Britain's EU partners about the
imminent deployment of 6500 extra troops, triggered by the Serbs' taking
of hostages, including 33 British soldiers. Six of them were being
treated in hospital last night after being injured when their captured
armoured personnel carrier crashed.
The warning from Europe, and the despatch of the British task force,
appeared to make little impact on Bosnian Serb army commander General
Ratko Mladic. He refused to release the hostages, although promised they
would no longer be chained to possible air strike targets.
However, he demanded an apology for the deaths of four of his men
killed in an action by French UN troops and warned without it he could
not guarantee the hostages' safety.
The Bosnian Serb Army also rescinded all agreements with the UN, said
any change in its mandate must be cleared with it first, and said the
hostages were prisoners of war.
Its general staff said the peacekeepers had ''openly put themselves on
the side of our enemies, guided combat aviation and engaged in constant
combat activity against the Serbian people and the BSA''. It also said
it was ''reclaiming full sovereignty over the entire territory and air
space of the Republika Srpska (its self-styled republic) and forbids
unathorised flights''.
Mr Hurd appealed for Russian help. He said it was vital that the
Russians, traditional allies of the Serbs, were on board at meetings of
the policy-deciding five-nation body, the Contact Group, which had
gathered at the French Embassy in The Hague last night.
''I don't think it is sensible for the Russians to become
semi-detached members,'' Mr Hurd said after briefing the Ministers in
Brussels. He said it was important that all members of the Contact Group
-- Britain, France, Germany, United States and Russia -- spoke the same
language.
Their language after The Hague meeting was diplomatic. Russian Foreign
Minister Andrei Kozyrev said the Group had agreed to back political
negotiations rather than force to solve the latest crisis.
He said the Ministers were calling for a ceasefire and the
continuation of diplomatic efforts to end the war. ''It's political
decisions rather than force,'' he said.
Mr Hurd revealed that a diplomatic deal with the Belgrade Serbs and
their leader, President Slobodan Milosevic, had almost been clinched
last week. Such a breakthrough would allow the lifting of sanctions
against the Belgrade regime in return for Serbian recognition of Bosnia.
This would finally distance Belgrade from the Serb rebels who now
control about 70% of Bosnia and are resisting an internationally-backed
settlement plan which would give them half the country.
0 Despite the threats and the diplomacy, the fighting on the ground
continued. Bosnian Serb forces battled Bosnian government and Croat
troops along volatile frontlines and kept up the pressure on UN units
around Sarajevo.
A shell hit the headquarters of Bosnia UN commander General Rupert
Smith.
The UN said the Serbs had captured five French light tanks, 15
armoured personnel carriers near Sarajevo and seven more around the
enclave of Gorazde. They also took four British Saxon armoured vehicles
around Gorazde.
Serb soldiers continued to threaten weapons collection points where
they have not yet rounded up UN guards. They already hold more than 350
peacekeepers.
Officials said the Serbs had given French soldiers at the Bare weapons
depot 15 minutes to surrender. The ultimatum passed without incident
although the Serbs used a light tank at the site to fire 11 shells at
government positions near Sarajevo.
Last night 160 French, Russian, Canadian and Ukrainian peacekeepers
were still under siege at observation posts and weapon collection depots
around the city.
UN military spokesman Lt-Col Gary Coward said many of the soldiers
were living inside armoured vehicles for their own protection.
The UN had radio contact with 25 of the British soldiers, who were
taken by the Serbs to Visegrad and said the soldiers indicated they were
being treated ''all right''.
To ensure they continue to be all right, the first of the 6500
reinforcements from Britain are due to fly out within days.
A battery of six 105mm guns and their crews from Colchester-based 19
Field Regiment are due to leave by RAF Hercules transport aircraft as
the initial phase of an operation designed to give the lightly-armed UN
troops the ability to strike back at long range.
Britain has vowed to exact swift and punishing retaliation if any of
the 33 Royal Welch Fusiliers taken hostage come to any harm.

PROOF of the existence of ghost trains was captured on film last
night.
The train appeared suddenly at Maryhill Station in Glasgow, then
mysteriously disappeared down the track -- at precisely one minute to
midnight.
Brave media souls who leaped aboard were reported safe and well -- in
Bishopbriggs -- some 11 minutes later.
But the sceptics were proved right: this was no psychic phenomena, or
journey into the unknown. The ghost train was one of two scheduled in
ScotRail's new summer timetable, running for the first time last night.
The 23.59 Maryhill-Bishopbriggs and 23.53 Cumbernauld-Glasgow Queen
Street services are a ruse, to avoid an embarrassing public inquiry into
line closures caused by the axing of the Fort William-London sleeper.
The plan to run ghost trains was first exposed by The Herald in April,
and led to Highland Regional Council raising a successful action in the
Court of Session earlier this month.
Lord Kirkwood ruled that the trains, of no benefit to the travelling
public and unlikely to carry any passengers, cannot properly be
described as a railway passenger service.
He added that British Rail's plan was a device to get round
time-consuming consultation procedures by running them over short
stretches of line in Strathclyde currently used only by the sleeper.
Lord Kirkwood then reprieved the sleeper, to be withdrawn on May 28,
pending public consultation. BR's appeal against that ruling will be
heard in the Court of Session on Thursday.
Those with an open mind for careful and objective observation of the
paranormal noted that they could see, touch, hear, and smell the ghost
train on its arrival at Maryhill.
Driver Jim Docherty, 27, was equally tangible, as was John, the
conductor, who charged #1.40 for the 11-minute, one-way ride.
There were two carriages, with 144 seats.
The journey was over so quickly that only three of the five
journalists on board had to pay. ScotRail collected a grand total of
#4.20.
Only one another person was on the train. He refused to identify
himself. ''I am just along for the ride.''
Asked if he was the sole member of the great travelling public, or a
BR employee, he whispered, eerily: ''I'm surprised at the interest this
train has generated.''
British Rail has conceded that the late-night trains are of little
practical use. But it argues such services on three stretches of line at
present used only by the sleeper means there is no closure of a
passenger service in terms of the 1993 Railways Act.
ScotRail has warned that more painful cuts in services will have to be
made elsewhere in the network if the loss-making Fort William service
must be retained.
Strathclyde Regional Council, which paid for Maryhill Station, is
furious that facilities financed by council taxpayers are now being used
to circumvent statutory closure procedures.
However, ScotRail -- clearly sensitive to the council's financial
muscle -- did at least use one which was not in Strathclyde's livery.

A LABOUR MP is calling for a Commons debate into the privatisation of
health care for mentally ill patients in Ayrshire.
It follows the signing last Friday of a contract between a health
company, Irvine Care, and Ayrshire and Arran Health Board to provide
care for 90 psycho-geriatric patients.
Cunninghame South MP Brian Donohoe claims the firm has promised to
build a new hospital in the grounds of the Ayrshire Central Hospital in
Irvine, mostly for patients suffering from dementia.
He said the issue raised several questions about the privatisation of
health care. ''This issue needs to be properly explored in public.''
The company behind Irvine Care is understood to be a private health
firm in the US. It is understood the contract is worth #1.6m in the
first year. The new hospital will care for NHS patients from other
Ayrshire hospitals.
The company was unavailable for comment last night.

Pretoria
A STORY about the Scottish rugby team and rowdy behaviour has been
uncovered as originating from the rival French camp.
The Scottish rugby management has demanded an apology from a South
African newspaper for printing the story, which claimed the Scots had
been banned from a Pretoria restaurant because of their behaviour.
The Scots have also made an official complaint to the Rugby World Cup
organisers about the French news agency AFP, which supplied the story to
the the Johannesburg Star.
There was talk of a French ploy, especially when it was discovered the
rumour started with the French team manager, Guy Laporte. Scotland meet
France in a crunch game on Saturday.
The Star's story had the heading: ''Girls arrive just in time to calm
down the Rowdy Scots.'' The article outlined how the Scottish party had
been joined by wives and girlfriends at the weekend after the game
against Ivory Coast on Friday night.
It went on: ''Scottish players have been the targets for complaints
about their boisterous behaviour from restaurants in Pretoria. One
proprietor, complaining of damage, has banned the tartan squad from the
premises.''
Scottish media liaison officer Brian Meek said that he had spoken to
the French news agency reporter who had filed the story and had been
told the restaurant wrecking theory had been raised at a French team
press conference.
''The reporter now accepts that the story is not true but he had filed
a quote from the French team manager Guy Laporte,'' Meek said.
He added that the reporter said Laporte had said ''the Scots were
staying in Pretoria and they had succumbed to temptation having 'broken'
two restaurants already. It is, of course, all nonsense.''
As the players trained at the Harlequins ground in Pretoria, Meek and
team manager Duncan Paterson also spoke to the Star 30 miles away in
Johannesburg.
Mr Paterson told the newspaper the story was untrue and that an
apology was in order. To emphasise the point, he said he might have to
''send down a couple of the boys''.
Meek said later that, of course, the boys would be sent down merely to
deliver the official protest.
Late yesterday, Mr Peter Robinson, assistant sports editor of the
Star, said: ''The story came from a reputable news agency and we printed
it in good faith as newspapers do every day of the week.
''I have spoken to AFP and, apparently, the story was filed by one of
their guys who was sent over from Paris.''
He added: ''If the Scots are really upset then, I suppose, we can
carry their side of things tomorrow. We got a call from the manager and
the media liaison man. Apparently we were told that a couple of the
Scots guys would be sent down to see us. Do you think they were
joking?''
Mr Paterson told a news conference the story was a ''complete and
utter fabrication''.
He added: ''We have taken the thing as far as we can at the moment. We
have complained to the newspaper and will be complaining to the
tournament organisers about the behaviour of the French news agency
which supplied the story.''
He said the onus was on the newspaper to have checked the facts before
printing the story and the fact that it had not done so was
''disappointing''.

THE University of Glasgow has provoked controversy amongst its staff
by creating a job for the wife of its new Principal, Professor Graeme
Davies.
When Professor Davies officially takes over in October, his wife,
Florence, will be made a part-time senior research fellow in the
Department of English Language.
Unlike most university jobs, the vacancy was not advertised, nor were
other applicants sought. Instead, it was created solely for Mrs Davies,
who currently lectures at Bristol University, so that she would have the
opportunity to continue her work in Glasgow.
Defending the decision, current Principal, Sir William Fraser, said
last night: ''I take the view that it would be unreasonable to expect
Mrs Davies to abandon her research career when Professor Davies takes up
his appointment in Glasgow.''
Professor Davies is presently based in Bristol as chief executive of
the Higher Education Funding Council for England and Wales.
Although the job has been specially created for Mrs Davies, a
university spokesman denied any suggestion that Professor Davies had
made his acceptance of the Glasgow job conditional on a position being
found for his wife.
Some members of staff, however, do not share Sir William's enthusiasm.
One commented: ''When money is desperately needed to ease the teaching
load in teaching establishments, is it right that money should be made
available for the wife of a man who will already be receiving a fat
salary?
''The university claims it is always making posts available for new
blood. If money was available, then should the job not have been
advertised and Mrs Davies taken her chance and applied on an equal
footing along with any others suitably qualified for a university
teaching post?
''There are many keen young graduates who would have been glad of the
opportunity to have such a post.''
The university spokesman, who declined to say what Mrs Davies would be
paid, said there would be advantages for the university as it would
benefit from the research.
Mrs Davies, who has just had a book on her work published, is involved
in applied linguistics, including the teaching of English as a foreign
language.
The row is similar to the criticism of Edinburgh University last year,
when its new Principal was also followed into a university post by his
wife.
An internal investigation there showed that Professor Stewart
Sutherland's wife, Sheena, had been appointed after open competition,
and had not been given any special favours.
