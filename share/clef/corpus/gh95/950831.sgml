Rob Adams rounds up the wealth of talent which gives the 1995
Dunfermline Jazz and Blues Festival its unique appeal
Fraser Spiers' Blues Cruisers
BEST known for his long association with Edinburgh blues singer Tam
White, Fraser Spiers has been perfecting his blues harmonica playing
since, as a teenager, he first heard his primary influence, the late
great Muddy Waters.
A weel-kent face around Glasgow for many years, Fraser's CV includes
gigs with visiting blues greats such as Arthur ''Big Boy'' Crudup, Eddie
''Cleanhead'' Vinson and Alexis ''Father of British Blues'' Korner, and
more recently he has been heard with jazz singer Carol Kidd and
country/folk band Rab Noakes and the Varaflames.
With the tightly disciplined, hard-driving Blues Cruisers, Fraser
Spiers is just the man to rock your socks right off.
Phil Mason's New Orleans All-Stars
ATTENTION to Crescent City detail, mixed with professionalism,
exuberance and spontaneous humour have made cornetist Phil Mason's
Allstars a spectacular success at jazz events throughout the UK and
Europe over the past few years.
Already equally convincing on a formal concert platform, in a hectic
festival programme or in the more intimate atmosphere of a jazz club,
the Allstars have recently added another specialism, the jazz religious
service, where Jamaican-born vocalist Christine Tyrrell comes into her
own as one of the leading gospel and spiritual singers around.
Christine can also pour her soul into an authentic blues and her
yearning voice, allied to the Allstars' consummate musicianship, makes
for a most exciting, memorable, and indeed unmissable sound.
Sheboom
STAY still if you dare as these sixty women percussionists thunder out
their unique mix of South American, African, and European rhythms with
unforgettable energy and passion.
Sheboom's performances have ranged from London's Royal Albert Hall,
where the Independent on Sunday heard their ''joyous primal ritual''; to
Barcelona, where they were the first non-Catalans to perform in the
Correfoc festival's 900-year history; to their native Glasgow, where
they produced a traffic-stopping drumathon in George Square during
Glasgow International Jazz Festival.
A unique and inspirational ensemble, Sheboom make a big, bonnie, and
unforgettable noise.
Rev Doc and the Congregation
THOSE who heard Rev Doc and co at last year's Edinburgh International
Blues Festival still talk about their vitality, their uncompromising
toughness, and their complete lack of reverence.
Doc may like his bit of fun and showmanship but there's no denying the
ability that has seen him twice become British Blues and Melodic Harp
Champion or the versatility that can take him from Texas roadhouse to
Greek taverna in his solo harmonica tours de force.
If you've heard Rev Doc and co before, you'll know the kind of
excitement to expect; if you haven't, you're in for an enjoyable and
startling initiation.
Holyrood Slim Band
FROM Edinburgh, this quartet plays a wide cross section of blues,
merging the acoustic influences of Big Bill Broonzy with the raw, urban
sounds of Hound Dog Taylor, and featuring their indefatigable vocalists
Holyrood Slim (harp and slide guitar) and Guitar Junior on, you've
guessed it, guitar.
Brass Street
THE essential accessory for any street party, this 15-piece marching
carnival band was formed for Glasgow's Year of Culture in 1990 and has
taken its ''having fun through playing music'' philosophy to city
streets all over the UK. Their musical style mixes African, Latin, funk,
and jazz influences, all played with tremendous spirit and unquenchable
verve.
Two's Company Ltd
PERFORMING timeless standards by Stephane Grappelli, Django
Rheinhardt, Cole Porter, Fats Waller, Stevie Wonder, and a host of
others, Two's Company Ltd is a stylish violin, guitar, and double bass
trio which plays with freshness and dynamism. Their swinging, melodic
sound captures the imagination of audiences wherever they play.
Roll Wyn James
LAST time a son of Nazareth appeared, heavenly hosts sang, shepherds'
nocturnal pursuits stopped, and three blokes turned up with presents. We
can't promise those things but when Chris Agnew, son of Nazareth's Pete,
lays down the bass grooves with a band that's played with everyone from
Johnny Copeland to Stirling Castle's ghost, be assured that the good
times will roll.
The Jimjammers
YOU name it (preferably in writing, on a #10 note) and these five
self-confessed nut cases from Edinburgh will play it. From a Bessie
Smith blues to a bossa nova, from New Orleans stomps to mainstream
ballads, Jim Baikie and the boys aim to please. ''We're cheerful
jazzers,'' they say. ''We're not the Glums.''
Perdido
FORMED in Glasgow five years ago, this quintet plays favourite songs
and tunes from the Ellington, Basie, Porter, and Gershwin catalogues
with the occasional bossa nova by Antonio Carlos Jobim. Already
established on both Edinburgh and Glasgow International Jazz Festival
circuits, their danceable and very listenable style is sure to add
Dunfermline to its list of satisfied customers.
Paul Lamb and the King Snakes
ONE of the hottest blues bands in Britain and a popular attraction
across Europe, Paul Lamb and the King Snakes are founded on their
leader's twenty-five years' harmonica playing experience.
During that time Northumberland-born Lamb has played with such blues
legends as Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, Buddy Guy and Junior Wells,
and Dr Ross, whose influences have helped Lamb establish an unbreakable
hold on the Best British Harmonica Player award.
A versatile player with tremendous feeling for the blues, Lamb will
quickly show why he is in great demand for television commercials and
programmes such as BBC1's Spender as well as concerts with Mark
Knopfler, Sting and the Blues Band.

Alison Kerr takes the blues beginner on a journey through the world of
jazz
JAZZ is a many-splendoured thing, and comes in all shapes and sizes.
For anyone coming to the music for the first time, the first question
must be: where to start. With so much to choose from and unless you have
a jazz junkie as a friend (in which case: gawd help you), it's probably
tempting just to ignore this type of music rather than spend time
getting to know what might appeal.
Festivals, like Dunfermline's, provide the ideal opportunity for
sampling some of what's on offer within our own country. Here, to
complement the festival, is a beginner's A to Z guide to help you
negotiate the wonderful world of jazz.
A is for. . . Armstrong. Louis of that ilk. He was the first jazz star
to break the boundaries between jazz and popular music. Born in New
Orleans in 1900, he grew up in a waifs' home, where his trumpeting
talents first attracted attention. By the time of his death in 1971,
''Satchmo'' had become an ambassador for jazz; known, respected, and
loved the world over as a musical genius and a great entertainer.
B is for. . . booze: the downfall of many a jazzman, and not a few
jazz festival frequenters. No wonder jazz musicians say (usually within
earshot of their sponsors): ''A drunken band is a happy band.''
C is for. . . Carol. Ms Kidd is without a doubt the best musical
export Scotland has to offer. See page 3.
D is for. . . Dixielanders, the scourge of the trendy jazz fan. OK, so
a lot of them are awful and wear funny hats with stripy waistcoats, but
the Dixie style -- like a New Orleans street band -- was the original
format for jazz, and shouldn't be ignored on the basis of a few old guys
with banjoes.
E is for. . . Ellington, the Duke thereof. Edward Kennedy Ellington
was undoubtedly the first great composer that the jazz world spawned.
Throughout his 50 years as a bandleader, pianist and arranger, he was
always at the cutting edge of jazz.
F is for. . . Fats. The amount of boozing and sitting in planes,
trains and automobiles means that obesity can be an occupational hazard
of the jazz musician. The greatest jazz giant of them all was Thomas
''Fats'' Waller, whose daily exercise programme clearly didn't extend
beyond his fingers.
G is for. . . guitar. Often overlooked as a jazz instrument in favour
of the dreaded banjo, jazz guitar seems to be making a comeback in lots
of different styles.
H is for. . . hot. ''Hot'' jazz was the label given to much of the
jazz of the 1920s, when the craze was for small, peppy bands and fast,
zippy numbers, often performed with growling horns.
I is for. . . improvisation: the aspect of jazz music which
distinguishes it from every other genre of music.
J is for. . . jings, of which there are three in the Original New
Orleans Jazz Band's 1919 recording of Jada (jada jada jing jing jing),
which featured Jimmy Durante on piano.
K is for. . . kazoo, a much-neglected jazz instrument, which formed
one third of the instrumentation (comb-and-paper and banjo were the
other two) in the Mound City Blue Blowers' million-selling recording of
Arkansas Blues in 1924.
L is for. . . Lady Day -- the legendary Billie Holiday who sang all
her life; from the mid 1930s, when her voice was carefree, optimistic
and innately swinging, to the late 1950s, by which time her ravaged,
gravelly vocals still managed to express exactly how she was feeling
through a song.
M is for. . . movies. Jazz and the movies go back a long way -- right
back to the advent of the talkie in 1927. The aforementioned Louis
Armstrong probably cropped up in more feature films than any other
jazzer.
N is for. . . nickname. Almost all the great figures in jazz history
were given at least one monicker by their contemporaries. Particular
favourites include the Bean (Coleman Hawkins), the Rabbit (Johnny
Hodges) and the royal family of the Prez, the Duke, the Count, the Earl
etc.
O is for. . . Oddfellows Hall, which was a 1950s jazz venue in
Edinburgh where clarinettist Sandy Brown worked as bandleader and a
certain Sean Connery was bouncer.
P is for. . . philanthropist. Had it not been for industrialist Andrew
Carnegie, there would have been no grand finale in The Benny Goodman
Story. New York's Carnegie Hall -- the venue for the Goodman band's
historic performance of Sing Sing Sing -- has played host to a number of
jazz concerts over the years. Now it is the turn of its Scottish
namesake -- in Carnegie's hometown of Dunfermline -- to swing swing
swing.
Q is for. . . Queens College, New York. This was the recipient of the
Louis Armstrong archive which contains 740 privately-made records and
tapes, most of which remain unissued.
R is for. . . ragtime. Many experts regard Scott Joplin's
revolutionary Maple Leaf Rag as the first example of jazz piano. Joplin,
a classically trained composer, was the first Afro-American to write
down music derived from the honky tonk style of the itinerant pianomen.
S is for. . . swing. The Mercer Ellington song still holds true: It
Don't Mean A Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing (doowah de wah). You've
either got it or you ain't.
T is for. . . tenor. The tenor is undoubtedly the sexiest of the sax
family -- (baritone comes a close second). Listen to any Stan Getz
record and you'll hear what I mean.
U is for. . . Under Milk Wood, the celebrated suite written by British
pianist and bandleader, Stan Tracey, and based on the brilliant Dylan
Thomas poem.
V is for. . . V-discs. In this range of records made for the US armed
services from 1943 until 1949, there was an extensive range of jazz.
W is for. . . Webster. Saxophonist Ben was one of the most wistful and
romantic-sounding exponents of the tenor.
X is for. . . xylophone -- never fully explored as a jazz instrument
in the way that the vibraphone has been.
Y is for. . . Young: Lester, ''The Prez''. Possibly the most eloquent
saxophonist of them all, his playing was heartbreakingly exquisite.
Z is for. . . zoot -- the suit made trendy in the 1940s by its
over-the-top wearer, Cab Calloway. And Zoot Sims, the soulful tenorist
who possibly suffered from a similarity in style with Stan Getz.

Alison Kerr on the orchestra which has its fair share of the baby
blues
MUSIC teacher Richard Michael's other job keeps him on his toes all
the time, and bears not a few resemblances to the post of football
manager. For Michael, who works at Beath High School, doubles as the
director of the Fife Youth Jazz Orchestra, playing at Dunfermline's
Carnegie Hall on Friday.
The Fife Youth Jazz Orchestra is much more than it sounds. For a
start, it's an umbrella name because there are three orchestras under
Michael's supervision. He calls them FYJO one to three.
To start at the beginning, the most junior members of the Fife Youth
Jazz Orchestra, those of 12 years of age and younger, play in FYJO
number three. In the league above them are the 25 slightly older
musicians who make up FYJO number two. Both outfits have been extremely
successful in national youth orchestra competitions and form a pool of
players who can graduate into the premier division orchestra.
FYJO number one has also won its share of awards and accolades -- not
least of them being an invitation to perform for HRH The Prince of Wales
at a garden party at Falkland Palace ealier this year.
FYJO one has the most typical big band instrumentation of the three:
five trumpets, four trombones, five saxes, a flute, a piano, a guitar,
bass, percussion and marimba, and drums.
Since the birth of the band in 1984, it has careered from strength to
strength, winning such illustrious admirers along the way as their guest
star for Dunfermline, top jazz vocalist Carol Kidd.
Kidd sang with them here last year and was so impressed with some of
the musicians that, her manager says, she would have loved to take them
on tour with her. Not bad for a band whose only prerequisites for
membership are enthusiasm and a basic knowledge of a musical instrument,
and not a rehearsal or proven level of musical competence.

THE feast of culture in Dunfermline district doesn't end when the
musicians pack up their horns and hit the road at the end of the jazz
and blues festival.
The Dunfermline District Arts Festival begins on September 15 and this
year celebrates the 700th anniversary of the alliance between Scotland
and France.
Many of the acts, therefore, display a delightfully Gallic influence,
with groups like Theatre du Pif, whose performance is inspired by the
work of French songwriter Jacques Brel.
There is a wealth of indigenous talent, with comedian Bruce Morton
starting the festivities. Singer/actress Barbara Dickson and the
acclaimed First Base Theatre Company are, quite literally, coming home
to perform. Young music lovers will be delighted at the return of The
Singing Kettle.
Inaugural performances come from Cwmni Ballet Gwent and the Scottish
artist Keith McIntyre, signalling the organisers' desire to make the
festival, and the community events as varied as possible.
Enquiries and bookings can be made at the Booking Office, Music
Institute, East Port, Dunfermline -- 01383 720108.

BILLIE Holiday said: ''There are two kinds of blues -- the happy blues
and the sad blues''. Fife band Baby Isaac does both. Named after the
baby born to the group's original bass player, Baby Isaac was formed
with the idea of creating an authentic Chicago blues sound. As the band
has evolved, its repertoire has broadened to accommodate other
influences, like jazz and swing.
The five-man band, below, won fans at last year's Dunfermline and
Edinburgh jazz and blues festivals, and has shared the bill with such
blues favourites as Paul Lamb and Snooky Prior. Earlier this summer,
singer Angela Moore joined the existing line-up of Gary Arnott, vocals
and harmonicas; Eddie Eugster, vocals, piano and hammond organ; Derek
Welsh, lead guitar; Graeme Smith, double bass; and Alan Moir,
percussion.
Edinburgh singer Edith Budge is making her Dunfermline debut fresh
from the Edinburgh International Jazz Festival where she was invited
onstage to perform with New Orleans singer Big Al Carson, and where
another highly respected New Orleans vocalist, Topsy Chapman, pronounced
her a genuine blues singer.
Edith, right, has been singing professionally for five years, since
she gave up nursing. Her musical taste spans everything from Jelly Roll
Morton to Frank Zappa, and despite the obvious comparisons to famous
blueswomen like Bessie Smith, her strongest point is that she sounds
like no-one but Edith Budge.
Edith will be joined by John Goldie, guitar; Andy Mitchell, bass; Tom
Findlay, piano; and Stuart Ritchie, drums.

Matt McVicars, chairman of the Dunfermline Jazz and Blues Festival,
welcomes music lovers to the packed 1995 programme
THE second Dunfermline Jazz and Blues Festival is following on from
the success of last year's inaugural event -- and looks like it is going
to be even better.
Holding a festival of any kind has two main benefits. It attracts new
tourists to the area and gives the local population a weekend of
entertainment.
We had found that towns even smaller than Dunfermline had jazz and
blues festivals which had run very successfully for some years, with
impressive figures regarding the amount of revenue generated from these
festivals.
With this in mind and also with thoughts of the run down in local
industry, mainly the loss of several thousand jobs at Rosyth Dockyard,
the Dunfermline Hoteliers' Association decided to do something which may
go some way in reversing the trends. Finding that trade, particularly in
the hospitality industry, was on the wane, the task of organising the
jazz and blues festival was set.
Initially professionals in fundraising and the hospitality industry
were recruited and a small committee was formed, with Jo Simpson, our
tourist officer; Margaret Oliver, a professional in marketing tourism
and the arts; fellow hotelier Jim Innes, the owner of three hotels
locally; myself, the owner of two hotels as chairman; and my wife Connie
as our secretary.
Woodrows of Dunfermline, the soft drinks manufacturer for the Central
Belt, agreed to be the main sponsor of the event. This was the catalyst
for the enthusiasm which surrounded the first jazz and blues festival,
which was held over the same weekend last year. With the success of the
event in mind, we began to plan the 1995 event.
This year's festival has been easier to organise, with many new
sponsors coming on board. Woodrows of Dunfermline are supporting again,
and in particular funding has come from Dunfermline District Council who
have organised a street festival during the same weekend as the jazz and
blues festival, to be named ''Razamajazz Streetfest'' which will be
taking place on Saturday, September 9, from 10am to 4pm.
It will mainly feature two lively bands known as Brass Street and
Sheboom, which is an all-female 60-strong drumming band with lots of
noise and lots of excitement. Just the thing to make a streetfest go.
Brass Street is a traditional jazz band who will be playing alternately
with Sheboom.
It is envisaged that they will parade in Dunfermline High Street,
Inverkeithing, and Rosyth villages just south of Dunfermline,
Cowdenbeath to the east, and North Queensferry where Deep Sea World --
our biggest and most recent addition to our tourist attractions -- lies.
There is also family fun in Pittencrieff Glen with around 30 arts and
crafts stalls with unusual gifts, an antique carousel, antique
chair-o-plane, face painting, fire eaters and stiltwalkers.
There will be a ''Doors Open Day'' for unusual venues which are not
normally open to the public such as the City Chambers, where a blues
band will be playing. There will also be jazz and blues bands playing in
various pubs and hotels.
Confidence is high regarding the success of the second Dunfermline
Jazz and Blues Festival and the organisers hope that everyone has a
great weekend. This year will be as good, if not better, than last year
and it looks like the festival will now be established as the jazz and
blues venue for the Dunfermline area for many years to come.
The Dunfermline hoteliers hope to see this developing into something
bigger. Next year we may be able to add another festival, maybe a folk
festival and perhaps a country and western festival, to add to the
wealth of live entertainment in Dunfermline district.

Alison Kerr previews the festival's headlining concert by Carol Kidd
CAROL Kidd is almost certainly Scotland's greatest gift to jazz fans.
Over the last six years, her sumptuous, clear vocals have prompted
luminaries of the musical world to wax lyrical about her unique singing
style. Broadcaster and trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton has called her ''an
all-time great in jazz''; veteran saxophonist, composer and arranger
Benny Carter described her voice as ''gorgeous, just gorgeous''; and --
most famously -- one Francis Albert Sinatra of New Jersey booked her to
open his 1990 Glasgow concert.
If you've heard Carol perform, these accolades won't come as a
surprise. What might surprise, however, is the fact that it took so long
for this marvellous vocalist to receive this kind of attention. The
delay, however, was really her own doing, as she opted to concentrate on
bringing up her three children rather than seriously pursue a singing
career.
Carol began singing professionally at the age of 15. In her teens, she
and Lulu joined forces and strategically divided up the talent contests
in Glasgow so that they were not always in direct competition. For five
years, Carol sang with the West Coast Jazz Band as they supported such
well-known names as Kenny Ball, Acker Bilk and Alex Welsh.
Once her children had grown up, Carol returned to singing, and quickly
re-established herself on the Glasgow circuit, with her trio of pianist
Sandy taylor, drummer Murray Smith and bass guitarist Alec Moore. Her
move -- from the hotel she had been running on the banks of Loch Lomond
-- to Cambridgeshire coincided with the beginnings of her association
with an English-based trio led by fellow Glaswegian, pianist David
Newton.
In October, she heads off to China and Hong Kong for a series of
concerts, so -- you've been warned -- catch her while you can.

SOCIAL work chiefs yesterday apologised for wrongly taking two young
brothers into care for five days.
The boys were seized after a health visitor claimed one had been
tortured with cigarette burns.
It was later found he had impetigo, a skin infection.
Their furious mother said: ''Their apology is not enough. I'm going to
see a lawyer.''
The mother said she had told the health visitor that one boy had a
skin infection but was not believed.
''A female doctor agreed with the health visitor that it was cigarette
burns and they rushed through a care order to have both my bairns taken
away.
''When we went to see them at their foster home they were screaming
that they wanted to come home.''
The mother added that the boy had developed six more blisters after he
went to the foster home.
''That was on the Sunday but it was the Tuesday before they agreed to
get a doctor.''
She fears the five days away would have a lasting effect on the boys.
One boy was now very insecure and his brother kept asking his mother
whether she loved him.
''He asks why I made him go away,'' their mother said. ''They've been
home just over a week now and they are still not over it.
A spokesman for Lothian Social Work Department last night said they
had written to the couple to apologise.
However, he added: ''Based on the information we had at the time, we
acted in the best interests of the children.''
The social work spokesman added: ''The child was taken to hospital for
examination where the opinion of the doctors was that the marks were
caused by cigarette burns.
''On day one, three doctors said these were consistent with cigarette
burns.
''While the children were in care, other marks appeared. We had a skin
specialist examine them.
''He diagnosed impetigo but said that, on the basis of the information
available earlier, he would also have said the original marks could have
been caused by cigarettes.''

GARY Armstrong, who won the last of his 30 caps against Ireland 18
months ago, has been named in the national squad just two games into his
comeback season following the devastating knee injury which threatened
to end his career.
Armstrong, who returned to the national side for the 1994 Calcutta Cup
game after a self-imposed sabbatical, saw that comeback curtailed when
he tore tendons in a thumb during the match against Ireland.
The 28-year-old then suffered severe damage to the ligaments of the
left knee during training with Jed-Forest at the start of last season
and, after surgery, missed all of that season and the World Cup in South
Africa.
He returned to the fray in a charity game just under a fortnight ago
and since then has played just one match, against Biggar, for his club.
He will make his third outing of the season when Jed begin their
premiership campaign against GHK on Saturday.
Armstrong said: ''I thought they would want to see me play a few more
games first. But I'm absolutely delighted. It's been a long haul and to
be given the chance to prove what I can do is fantastic.
''I'm not setting my sights on getting back for the game against
Western Samoa in November. I've looked forward too often in the past and
been disappointed. I'll just take each game as it comes.
''The knee is fine. After a couple of games and a lot of contact work
at training it's not bothered me at all.''
Armstrong is one of four scrum halfs in the 46-strong squad, details
of which were announced by SRU director of rugby and national coaching
director Jim Telfer at Murrayfield yesterday. The sitting tenant, Bryan
Redpath, Derrick Patterson, and Andy Nicol being the others.
There were no clues from yesterday's announcement as to who would take
over the Gavin Hastings mantle as captain of the side. Rob Wainwight
must remain the front-runner, but Telfer said there were a number of
options and currently the captaincy represented an ''open door.''
The departure of Hastings, too, leaves a vacancy at full back. Rowen
Shepherd and Michael Dods are possibilities for the No.15 shirt,
although Scott Hastings and Kenny Logan are other players who could be
schooled for the role.
Once again, Craig Chalmers notwithstanding, the retirement of Hastings
leaves a void in the goal-kicking department, and Telfer declared:
''Jonah Lomu may have been the star of the World Cup, but the record
books will show that it was the goal-kickers, like Gavin, who had the
most impact on the tournament.
''Some people want to see a penalty goal worth 10 points, but I would
like to see as many offences as possible punished by a free kick rather
than a penalty goal. There are problems with that, in terms of people
killing the ball and so on, but I just feel that the importance of a
goal-kicker has to be devalued.''
The retirement of Iain Morrison leaves a vacancy in the back row for
the coming season, while the recovery from long-term back injury of Alan
Sharp means competition for the redoubtable David Hilton in the front
row.

UEFA'S two most influential figures, president Lennart Johansson and
general secretary Gerhard Aigner, will return from Georgia this evening,
and after they have submitted a report on their trip, the European
governing body may be willing to instruct Dynamo Batoumi and Celtic to
play their European Cup-winners' Cup, first-round tie outwith the
trouble-torn republic.
A UEFA spokesman said yesterday that while it was still the intention
to play the tie in Georgia, everything could change depending on the
experiences of Johansson and Aigner on their two-day trip. If they feel
the situation in Georgia is in any way dangerous, they will recommend a
change of venue for the first leg, which is scheduled for Thursday,
September 14.
The spokesman stressed that their top-level delegation had not been
sent because of Celtic's fears concerning the tie, but that they had
merely been following a previously laid-down agenda. However, there is
no doubt that the timing of their visit could be a blessing for Celtic,
who have already received information from the Georgian Consulate in
London and also the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, warning them of the
hazards about journeying to that part of the world during these times of
social and political unrest there.
Celtic have asked the SFA to make representations to UEFA on their
behalf, but the European body have said that two preliminary ties played
in Georgia within the last few weeks were staged without trouble.
A Yugoslavian side, FC Obilic, played in Batoumi in the Cup-winners'
Cup and Macedonia's Vardar played against Samtredia in Georgia in the
UEFA Cup, and the reports of referees and observers suggested all was
well.
However, the conditions and standards of safety can deteriorate
rapidly in countries in which there are power struggles, and no-one's
safety can be guaranteed, not even the leader of the Georgian republic,
Eduard Shevardnadze, as was demonstrated the other day when he was hurt
when a car bomb exploded.
UEFA must think long and hard before ordering Celtic into a republic
in which tensions are running high, uncontrolled possession of firearms
is widespread, and violent crime levels are soaring.
Apart from that, a diphtheria epidemic is spreading through parts of
the republic, and Johansson and Aigner, who will have been transported
in limousines from the moment they arrived in Georgia, must look beyond
the VIP treatment they would receive and consider the lot of Celtic and
their supporters.
If there is any doubt, and it should not be forgotten that the
Georgian office in London are not exactly upbeat, then the venue for the
first leg should be changed.
If Celtic are forced to travel to the Black Sea resort and things go
wrong, UEFA should be held accountable.
It is true, of course, that Belfast was never declared a no-go area
even at the height of the troubles, but that does not mean everything
will be well in Georgia. There would be no point in tempting fate.
All thoughts about the European trip will be shelved while Celtic try
to beat Raith Rovers for the second time within a week in tonight's
Coca-Cola Cup, third-round tie. Celtic beat Raith 1-0 on the opening day
of the premier division on Saturday and their assistant manager, Billy
Stark, said he would settle for a repeat of that scoreline.
He wouldn't be drawn much on this game being a revenge tie because
Raith beat Celtic in the final last season, and said his team's only aim
was to reach the next round. ''Hopefully, we can use the bigger pitch to
our advantage, but I suppose that with Raith being a team anxious to
play football, Celtic Park might also be to their advantage.''
Phil O'Donnell and John Hughes, who were the only two injury worries,
were able to train yesterday and the chances are they will be available.
Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl said he took a lot of encouragement from
Saturday's match, despite the result, and added: ''Throughout the first
hour we didn't look as though we were intimidated in any way, and we
took the game to Celtic, but in the second half they were the better
side.
''We'll go through to Glasgow and hope to start off in the same way
and try to maintain that form, but again, I don't expect us to be afraid
of playing at Celtic Park.''

Rangers 3, Stirling Albion 2
IT will not go down as one of their most memorable nights of the
season, but the Ibrox regulars, which means 98% of the 36,685 crowd,
went home content at least that there was no repeat of last year's
defeat by Falkirk at this stage of the Coca-Cola Cup.
There seemed little danger of that until the amazing finale, the last
nine minutes when, three down, Albion discovered the way to goal and
scored twice, forcing Rangers into a sweaty finish as the wee team went
for the equaliser.
There were some embarrassed faces in blue shirts as they left the
field -- home but only just. They had been nothing more than competent
and very nearly paid for their complacency. They made it into the
fourth-round draw tomorrow but not at all impressively. The boos at the
end were an illustration of what the troops felt about it all, and they
were justified.
Charlie Miller continues to be Rangers' most potent player, running
the midfield action with poise and confidence, and this time he had
Gordan Petric beside him, sometimes wonderfully composed, sometimes so
laid back he was left behind, as well as Stuart McCall, scorer of the
second goal, after the interval, which seemed to have put paid to any
ambitions the Stirling team may have held.
They had gone behind earlier after a bad error by their keeper, but
kept plugging away and even after Ally McCoist, inevitably, scored the
third, they did not quit. They grabbed two goals in a pulsating finish
that woke up the crowd and alarmed Rangers.
The wee Stirling group huddled in their corner of the Broomloan Stand
enjoyed the start but, unfortunately, they had a close look at the
blunder that let Rangers take the lead after 14 minutes.
Keeper Mark McGeown suffered a lot worse than they did when he saw the
ball go over his line. A corner from Miller was cleared back to him but
when Hateley met his cross with a long, languid header, there seemed no
danger as the keeper reached to take it in his arms.
The next moment he had missed the ball and grasped air as it slipped
inside his near post.
Just before that a Petric free kick was deflected and left the goalie
with no chance but came off a post. However, his luck was to run out
soon after.
The confidence of the second-division side, understandably, was burst
like a pierced balloon and Rangers were cruising. They very nearly went
two ahead when McCoist chipped the keeper but the ball landed on top of
the net.
Once they had got over the disappointment, Stirling came back at the
premier lot again, and McCormick was only inches away from reaching a
low cross from Mike McKechnie.
McCoist finished a clever Rangers move with a weak header before David
Robertson had an effort which went across goal and off the far post.
Tommy Tait was booked for a foul on Richard Gough, but it was the
Ibrox aficionados who were getting frustrated at some slack play by
their heroes.
Albion carried on playing as if they could still sense glory, and Ian
McInnes encouraged them with a shot that Goram held early in the second
half.
Robertson came close with a drive before the crowd at last had the
chance to welcome the second goal.
Mikhailichenko slipped the ball inside to McCall, who took a couple of
strides before hitting the ball low into a corner.
That left only the question of how many? to be answered. McCoist gave
one reply, a third goal, in 72 minutes after a McCall try had been
blocked.
Stirling were still to get their consolation. A cross by John Gibson,
who had come on for Paul Deas, was headed in by Taggart. That was nine
minutes from the end, and four minutes later they did it again, this
time McCormick stepped in to shoot home after Goram had parried a McLeod
shot.
RANGERS -- Goram, Wright, Robertson, Gough, McLaren, Petric, McCall,
Miller, McCoist, Hateley, Mikhailichenko. Substitutes -- Durrant, Durie,
Thomson.
STIRLING ALBION -- McGeown, McKechnie, Watson, Mitchell, McQuilter,
Tait, McInnes, Deas, McCormick, Taggart, McLeod. Substitutes: Gibson,
Farqhuar, Armstrong.
Referee -- A Huett (Edinburgh).

ENGLISH OPEN
LAURA Davies makes her final appearance of the season on the American
Express Tour this week in the Wilkinson Sword English Open at The
Oxfordshire Club.
She concedes that her chances of topping the money lists on both sides
of the Atlantic this year have now disappeared. Davies is #31,455 behind
Sweden's Annika Sorenstam in Europe, and her winnings of $445,132 leave
her almost $30,000 behind Dottie Mochrie on the LPGA Tour.
''Annika is beyond reach here,'' said Davies, ''but there is still a
chance of winning in America.''
Missing the cut in the du Maurier Classic in Canada last week gave
Davies the luxury of four days off. Even so, her schedule is formidable
for the remainder of the year. Three tournaments in America, two in
Korea and Japan, one in Australia, followed by two more in America will
complete her year.
Following a tournament in Portland next week, Davies moves on to
Muirfield Village for the filming of the Wendy's Three Tour Challenge,
which will be shown on TV at the end of the year.
John Daly, Lee Janzen, and Peter Jacobsen represent the US PGA, Jack
Nicklaus, Raymond Floyd, and Hale Irwin form the seniors team. ''I am
just hoping for a Nicklaus-Daly draw,'' smiled Davies.
Scotland's Dale Reid, fifth in two of her last three tournaments,
should be at home on the exposed Rees Jones course.0 After having
experimented with a broom-handled putter in the Welsh Open earlier this
month, she has regained her form with a conventional putter. ''I am
going to work with the broom-handled club during the winter,'' said
Reid.

ENGLAND captain Will Carling predicted a ''culture shock'' for his
squad following the repeal of the amateur regulations by the
International Board at the weekend.
''As a selector I will have hard, invidious decisions to make in
dropping a player and altering his income expectation,'' said Carling,
who will lead England for an eighth consecutive season.
''But the players have agreed that the rewards of being an
internationalist will not be restricted to the immediate squad.''
Carling stated his ''tremendous admiration for the International Board
and their honesty,'' but already the players were having very positive
discussions with officials.
''The IB decision has not affected the basic ideal that the game
should not be hijacked by sponsors, TV or entrepreneurs.''
Rugby Football Union (RFU) secretary Tony Hallett described the IB
changes as a total, big bang. He said: ''It eliminated sleazy,
under-the-table payments.''
* WESTERN Province, who were to have played a couple of games against
Glasgow and the South in November, have pulled out because the tour
clashed with the South Africans' preparations for the Super Ten
tournament. Griqualand West have filled the breach and will play against
Glasgow at Scotstoun on November 13 and against the South at Netherdale
on November 17.
* IEUAN Evans, the former Wales captain, will equal J P R Williams'
national record of 55 caps when he lines up against South Africa in
Johannesburg on Saturday.
Evans is by far the most experienced player chosen for the one-off
Test against the Springboks in a side which includes three new caps,
loose-head prop Chris Loader, centre Gareth Jones and full back Justin
Thomas. Team:
J Thomas (Llanelli); I Evans (Llanelli), G Thomas (Bridgend), G Jones
(Bridgend), S Hill (Cardiff); N Jenkins (Pontypridd), A Moore (Cardiff);
C Loader (Swansea), J Humphreys (Cardiff), captain, J Davies (Neath), P
Arnold (Swansea), D Jones (Cardiff), A Gibbs (Newbridge), M Bennett
(Cardiff), H Taylor (Cardiff).
Replacements -- M Taylor (Swansea), A Williams (Swansea), P John
(Pontypridd), A Moore (Swansea), L Mustoe (Cardiff), G Jenkins
(Swansea).

<HEADLINE>Litmanen gives Ajax touch to national team. Finns' star man aims for Hampden repeat</HEADLINE>

FOR a man who represents the biggest threat to Scotland's hopes of
reaching the European Championship finals in England next year, Jari
Litmanen is far too likeable. That made Plan A, to kick him under the
table, impossible to implement and Plan B, to talk him into trepidation,
none too attractive, although his own clinical assessment of his team's
chances lends some encouragement to tartan ambitions.
The prospects would have been all the better if this 24-year-old
striker, Finland's best player, probably their finest ever, had not
recovered from a knee injury which has kept him put of action recently.
The good, or bad, news is that he is much better. ''I am ready to play
in Scotland now,'' he told me as we chatted this week in Ajax's Meer
Stadium. ''I have played one-and-a-half games with the reserves and am
now back with the first team.'' In fact, he was due to play last night
for Ajax against Real Madrid in a challenge match in Spain.
He looks forward to revisiting Hampden, where he scored in his
country's 1-1 draw four years ago -- ''I would like to score again'' --
but is brutally honest about his team's hopes of the victory they need.
''We have to go there to win because if we are to get to England, we
must beat Scotland.
''That is very, very difficult, because if you look at my country's
record, it is not encouraging. In five years we have won only one
qualifying game away from home, against Israel. To get a draw with
Scotland at Hampden would be a good result, but to win would be a very
big step for Finland.''
He is at a loss to explain the 6-0 thrashing at home from Russia in
Finland's last game, although he and three other major players were
absent. ''I don't know what went wrong. Maybe the players who were
missing will make a big difference.'' He shakes his head when he recalls
the scoreline and adds: ''I have seen the goals we lost and I think you
can say there was certainly something wrong.''
Speaking in excellent English, Litmanen attempted to explain the
inconsistency of his country's play, which has made them a kind of
Partick Thistle of the international scene. ''It has always been like
this for us. We can take three points off good teams sometimes and we
can get beaten by poorer teams, as well as better teams, if we don't
have a good day.'' That rang uncomfortably familiar but it seemed
prudent not to emphasise the point.
''If we have one of our good days, who knows what will happen? When we
play good we can get a good result, maybe against Scotland. If we get a
draw, we still have to play away against the Russians, but you can never
be sure in football.
''If I were to be realistic I would have to say both Scotland and
Russia would be too strong for us.''
He may not play like a British striker but he loves watching the
British game. For him, the fact that everyone on the field gives 100%
for 90 minutes is fascinating. ''They want to win all the time. Other
countries play with one attacker but if they play a game when they have
to win, they would use three. Scotland, England, and Ireland always go
for the victory.''
He concedes that when the Finns took on the minnow teams in the group,
San Marino and the Faroes, they played with three forwards. Will they do
that at Hampden next Wednesday? ''We have to score, so we have to play
an attacking game. But I thought we would play attacking football
against Russia, so maybe we got it wrong. I don't think we could risk
three forwards at Hampden.'' He remembers the last time at Hampden, when
he felt the Finns played really well but acknowledges that they would
have to do even better this time.
Litmanen, clearly, is a pragmatist as well as an optimist, and
describes a scenario when his country gets into a winning position,
which is easily enough appreciated here.
''I thought when we started out in the group that, if we played good,
we might beat Greece into third place behind Russia and Scotland. Then
we did well and went to the top of the section and people thought: 'We
have a very good team now.' But they forgot that we still had the
hardest games to come, against the Scots and Russians twice. For me,
they are still the favourites.''
He was impressed by Scotland when the teams met last year in Helsinki
-- the Scots won 2-0 -- but does not single out any particular threats.
''Before that game I thought Scotland was pulled along by one or two
very good players, but it turned out they were good as a team. They
worked well together.''
He was marked then by Alan McLaren and anticipates a similar situation
next week. ''It makes things difficult for me but I am used to that.
People look at our team and there is one player with Ajax next to his
name. The other teams are usually Finnish and maybe not so well known
and so I have to expect the special attention.''
Litmanen readily accepts the mantle placed upon him by his
compatriots. ''I know I have a very important role to play in Finnish
football. A lot of people there don't follow football but they follow
me. It is a little bit crazy but although football is popular, it is a
popular hobby. Ice hockey is serious.
''If I am training and playing with Ajax, who are champions of Europe,
it is professional. When I go back to play with my country, it is
semi-professional. I am trying to introduce some ideas to the national
side but I have to be careful.''
He has won 40 caps, which beat his father before him, and that gives
him special satisfaction. But he accepts that the move to Ajax after
playing for three teams in Finland, including MyPa 47, the side that
knocked Motherwell out of the UEFA Cup, has given him the chance to
achieve much more than any of his predecessors.
''Of course, playing in the Champions' League was the peak for me. My
dream is to play for Finland in the European Championship or World Cup
finals, but maybe that will never happen. So for me the Champions'
League is the top competition and my chance to win something, and also
show what I can do at a high level.''
He takes great pride in being part of the Ajax team that holds the
European Cup and is especially pleased that they beat the great AC Milan
three times to do it. ''When you look at the great players in that side
and how they had been at the top for so long, I can feel proud to play
in the Ajax team that beat them.''
Although he is as patriotic as the next Finn, Jari is a fan of Ajax,
as well as one of their stars. ''I have learned so much here. We play to
a system that is unique, with three front players. We each know our own
job, we also have to know the other players' roles. That wa,y when we
move about we can do their job as well as our own, and if someone is out
injured someone else comes in who knows the job.''
Jari admits to puzzlement at Rangers' failure to get to the very late
stages of the Champions' Cup. ''Rangers are seven times champions of
Scotland? Yes? I thought five years or maybe two years ago, Rangers have
a good team and can do something in the Champions' League but it was a
surprise for me that it never happened. They have good players so I
don't know what went wrong. I know they almost made it a few years ago
but 'almost' is a big word.''
However, the Ajax man has words of hope for Ibrox fans. ''Now Rangers
have Gascoigne and Laudrup, two players who know how to play in Europe.
I think that is one important reason why the British teams have not done
so well before. They play a different kind of game but now there are a
lot of European players in Britain who will make a difference. That is a
good thing.''
He reckons the result which will be of most interest across Europe,
once the Champions' League gets into full flow, will be the one between
Rangers and Juventus. ''That should be very interesting.''
The Finn is not sure how he would fit into the British game but he
sees signs, at least in England's Premiership, that the kick-and-rush
style is disappearing. ''Arsenal are not playing so much the long-ball
game, and now with Bergkamp, they won't do that.''
Litmanen and his Ajax team-mates, each of whom took many minutes to
sign for the autograph-hunters awaiting them outside the players'
entrance, know that winning the European Cup again will be a tougher
task than winning it once. Whether the current squad can equal the
magnificent three successive wins of the side in the early seventies
remains to be seen, but Litmanen insists that the players are determined
to do it at last once more. ''Of course, the pressure will be greater
because we are the champions. Up till now, AC Milan was the team
everybody wanted to beat but now it will be us.
''It is difficult to say if we will be as good or better than last
year. We are missing Frank Rijkaard, who played 15 years at the highest
level, and now we have Marcos Santos and play a little bit different.
But the system stays much the same.''
It was his turn to head for the autograph-seekers. ''See you in
Scotland,'' he said as he disappeared down the stairs. He didn't fall,
either.

SHIRLEY Robertson is looking to be playing her most significant game
of golf this Saturday.
She clocked up her seventh consecutive victory in the Europe
Single-handed Class at the Brut British Olympic Sailing Trials off
Weymouth yesterday and another three victories and Robertson could be
relaxing on the golf course well before the trials end.
Only once yesterday did her total dominance of the class falter, as a
massive shift in wind direction appeared from the opposite side of the
course, but she was saved by the abandoment signal.
From now on, so great is her lead that top-three places would still
guarantee a chance to better her ninth place in the class in 1992 in
Barcelona.
As the two-man 470 class leadership is reduced to a three-cornered
fight at best, Ian Jamieson and Alisdair Green (Dalgety Bay) took a
gamble to the far left of the eighth race and won. Scots Graeme Grant
and Kenneth Donaldson led twice but could only fly their spinnaker
downwind as they had forgotten their spinnaker pole.
World No.1 John Merricks and Ian Walker lead by 18 points while Andy
Richards and Ian Park (Helensburgh) lie fifth. Still carrying a
disqualification in his overall tally, Adrian Jones (Girvan) took a
second and ninth place yesterday and lies fourth overall in the Mistral
Windsurfer Class. Results:
Brut British Olympic Sailing Trials. 470: Overall standings -- 1, J
Merricks and I Walker (England) 9.75 points; 2, J Belben and M Fenwick
(England) 28; 3, P Brotherton and S Lovegrove (England) 29.75; 5, A
Richards and I Park (Scotland) 44; 12, N Biggs and M Turner
(Wales/Scotland) 96.
Europe -- 1, S Robertson (Scotland) 5.25; 2, A Lucas (England) 16; 3,
J Singleton (England) 25; 10, B Mucklow (Scotland) 75; 12, D Winstanley
(Scotland) 79; 13, K Coupland (Scotland) 85.

TOP teams return to Glasgow for the first time in more than six years
this weekend for the City of Glasgow Integrated Tournament at the Kelvin
Hall.
Integrated refers to the fact that there are also women's and disabled
events and indeed much of the focus will be on the wheelchair event,
which features the two current European club champions, Oldham Owls and
Action Steelers from Sheffield. Scotland's representatives are West of
Scotland.
''We hope to lift the profile of basketball in the city, particularly
wheelchair basketball,'' explained Glasgow development officer Warren
Read.
But there is no doubt that the main attraction will be the Budweiser
League teams with the man described as a ''rebounding machine,'' Robert
Youngblood, leading London Leopards and Birmingham Bullets including a

LES Ferdinand grabbed his fourth goal of the season after 67 minutes
of the derby with Middlesbrough to give Newcastle the outright lead of
England's Premiership.
Leeds, who also had maximum points before last night, looked on their
way for a fourth straight win when Tony Dorigo put the high-flying
Yorkshire side ahead after 70 minutes at The Dell against Southampton,
but the bottom club secured their first point of the campaign when Tommy
Widdrington grabbed an equaliser with nine minutes left.
Wales striker Mark Hughes scored his first goal for Chelsea to give
them a 2-0 lead after 10 minutes over Coventry in the Premiership match
at Stamford Bridge.
Dennis Wise had given Chelsea the lead with a penalty, but Brazilian
Marques Isaias pulled a goal back with a strike right on half-time and
Zimbabwean striker Peter Ndlovu completed a fine Coventry comeback by
equalising after 54 minutes.
Also on the mark for his new club for the first time was Belgian
internationalist Marc Degryse, one of the continental players Celtic
were pursuing over the summer. He put Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 up after
10 minutes against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park, but the match finished
2-2.
England defender Neil Ruddock's goal on the half-hour was enough for
Liverpool to keep the points against QPR at Anfield.
Don Hutchison gave West Ham the lead in 24 minutes against London
rivals Spurs at Upton Park, where Israeli internationalist Ronny
Rosenthal levelled after 55 minutes.
A Joe Parkinson goal near the hour mark gave Everton the lead away to
Manchester City and Nigerian international striker Daniel Amokachi added
a second 14 minutes from time.
Dwight Yorke's goal 15 minutes from time gave Aston Villa victory over
Bolton at Villa Park.
* OLEG Salenko will make his Old Firm debut in front of Scotland's

DON King yesterday put a price of #33m on a Nigel Benn-Roy Jones
unification fight.
Boxing's top promoter believes sheer appeal and hard cash could break
down the pay-per-view television politics to bring the high-flying
super-middleweights together for the that WBC champion Benn most wants
to climax his outstanding career.
''We can split the money and take away the fences to get the
politics,'' said King. ''It's time to drop the gauntlet before Jones'
manager Fred Levin. It's time to put up or shut up. If Nigel wants to
fight, let's get it on.''
The stumbling block is that IBF holder Jones is tied to the Home Box
Office organisation while Benn, with his King connection, fights for
rival American network Showtime.
Meantime, Benn defends against substitute Ray Perez, from North
Carolina, at Wembley on Saturday night. The replacement for Steve Little
has won 18 of 21 fights, but has stopped only five rivals.

Livingston 1, Partick Thistle 2
TWO second-half goals -- both from the penalty spot -- by midfield
player Albert Craig sent Thistle into the quarter-finals of the
Coca-Cola Cup at the expense of Division 3 Livingston last night.
Thistle were made to battle by Jim Leishman's side who played some
attractive football and were not intimidated by the premier division
side after five successive wins before last night.
But the visitors deserve credit for pummeling the Livingston goal in
the second half, and their pressure was such that penalties appeared
inevitable with the number of last-gasp challenges going on in the
penalty area.
The impact that Leishman has made since taking over at Livingston was
evident even before kick-off. He was given an ovation by the home fans
as he walked to the Meadowbank dugout.
It did not take long for his team to decide the reason why he is held
in such esteem. They took the game to Thistle with slick passing.
After some near things at the Thistle goal, they failed to heed the
warning. Duthie provided the pass that led to Jason Young shooting
Livingston ahead midway through the half, beating his marker and
crossing the ball over well.
Thistle had the ball in the net before this but Rod McDonald had
clearly fouled keeper Stoute, and there were no protests from the
Thistle players when referee Hugh Dallas disallowed the effort.
The shouts were louder, however, nine minutes from half time when an
Craig shot appeared to strike the arm of Williamson, but no penalty was
given.
It was one-way traffic for most of the second half, with Thistle
laying siege to the Livingston goal. They won corner upon corner and the
home side somehow managed to survive until 68 minutes.
It took a goal-line clearance from Smart to deny Craig in one attack
but the goal when it came was clear cut.
Martin tripped substitute Harry Curran in the penalty area, and Craig
stepped up to send Stoute the wrong way with the resultant penalty.
Thistle were awarded their second penalty 13 minutes from time when
Craig was pulled down by Stoute, and he made no mistake again though
ordered to retake his second kick by referee Dallas.
LIVINGSTON -- Stoute, Smart, Martin, Davidson, Williamson, Sorbie,
McMartin, Bailey, Young, Alleyne, Duthie. Substitutes -- Harvey,
Callaghan, Sinclair.
PARTICK THISTLE -- Walker, Dinnie, Pittman, McWilliams, Watson, Welsh,
McDonald, Craig, Foster, Turner, Cameron. Substitutes -- Gibson,
Tierney, Curran.
Referee -- H Dallas (Bonkle).

COLIN Montgomerie, tuning up for the Canon European Masters in
Crans-Sur-Sierre, believes the American crowd could be ''the biggest
problem'' when the European Ryder Cup team meet the USA next month.
However, the Scot thinks that Jose Maria Olazabal's fitness problems
could prove a blessing in disguise.
Montgomerie, who gained his first victory of the year when he won the
recent German Open, says: ''We are playing near New York and the crowd
there are the loudest in the States. They will be very partisan and we
must be mature enough to cope with it.
''We shall have to work things out and help our two rookies, Per-Ulrik
Johansson and Philip Walton, as much as we can. If you expect bad crowd
behaviour, things are never quite so bad as you imagine.''
As for Olazabal's foot problem, Montgomerie added: ''If Jose Maria
cannot play twice a day it could be beneficial when we get to the
singles. We tend to flog our top players and it does not pay off in the
singles.
''In the last match I was the only one of the top six who won their
singles. Jose Maria, Seve (Ballesteros), and Bernhard Langer lost and
Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam only halved, so we got just two points.
''Woosie is not in next month but we should expect at least
three-and-half points from our top five this time. And if Jose Maria
only plays once on the first two days, it will give greater
opportunities to the other players.''
Montgomerie says he will not ease up before the cup match. ''I'm
playing here in Switzerland this week, in Paris next week, and then the
British Masters,'' he said. ''I would rather play than sit at home and
think about the Ryder Cup. And I play better when I play a lot.''
He also is clear on another point -- that he will not be following
Faldo into on the US Tour next year. ''I'm sticking to the same
schedule, probably playing about eight tournaments in the States as I
did this year,'' he says.
This week in Switzerland his main rivals for the European Masters
title are expected to be world No.1 Greg Norman and US Open champion
Corey Pavin. But the American was taken ill yesterday with suspected flu
and pulled out of the pro-am, although he insists he will be able to
start in the first round today.
Norman, who made the headlines last week by winning the World Series
in Akron, Ohio, and also by accusing American Mark McCumber of cheating
by tapping down a spike mark on the seventh green, is in prime form.
Montgomerie says, jokingly, that if he gets to the point where he has
won as much money as Norman and has the same charisma he will buy
himself a jet. ''It would change my life,'' says Montgomerie. ''Just
think, you could go anywhere you liked on your own steam.''
Of Norman himself, Montgomerie adds: ''He is a marketing dream. He
plays well, speaks well, takes defeat well, accepts victory gracefully.
He is the Arnold Palmer of my era. He has done everything so we all know
what is attainable. You do it or you don't. Me, I just want to do the
best I can do and that is all you can ask.''

SCOTLAND'S hopes of an individual medal in the World Mountain Racing
Trophy have been enhanced by the failure of Kenya to forward a team to
the organisers.
To be staged on Arthur's Seat a week on Sunday, it is the first world
championship athletics event hosted in Scotland for 18 years, and the
form of Tom Murray in the trial has convinced the Greenock runner that
he has medal prospects.
However, the presence of Kenyan runners, who had intimated interest,
would blunt such aspirations, formed after Murray, making his
hill-racing debut, won the trial by almost two minutes.
The championships comprise three races, for senior and junior men, and
senior women. The latter two run over 7850 metres with a climb of 1700
feet, while the senior men's event is over 12,200m, climbing more than
3000 feet.

CANADA'S attempt to hit the jackpot, by backing their sprint relay
squad to break the world record at the recent world championships, has
provoked an enquiry which could result in their government athletics
grant being slashed.
When the Canadian team won gold in Gothenburg, but failed in their
record attempt, no-one believed the insurance policy taken out on their
behalf would generate so much controversy.
The Canadian track and field body, Athletics Canada, paid $4500 to
insure against a world best, and would have collected $50,000 if the
quartet, including Donovan Bailey and Bruny Surin, the respective
individual 100 metres gold and silver medallists, had succeeded.
But now a public outcry has led to demands for investigation into
misappropriation of public money, and charges that Athletics Canada,
which receives federal government funding, has effectively gambled on
its own team.
The director of marketing for Athletics Canada, Ted Wagstaff, who
devised the scheme, is unrepentant. ''It's probably because its the
first time this has happened in Canada, in track and field anyway,''
Wagstaff said, adding that it was his understanding that such a
marketing ploy was common in Europe.
''Athletics Canada gets only about 55 to 60% of its overall budget
from the Canadian government grant. The rest is self-generated, so it
clearly wasn't public money used for the insurance policy.''
But politicians have now entered the arena, and Monte Solberg, the
Reform Party's amateur sport critic, wants the government to investigate
what he calls an: ''unethical, sleazy use of tax dollars.''
He has written to Michel Dupuy, minister responsible for amateur
sport, demanding action. A spokesman for Dupuy said enquiries had
already been made. ''We were concerned whether public funds had been
used for purchasing this insurance policy, and we received verbal and
written assurances that they were not,'' the spokesman said.

Dundee 3, Kilmarnock 1
A THRILLING second half fightback by rejuvenated Dundee saw them
deservedly earn a place in tomorrow's Coca-Cola Cup quarter-final draw.
Words of wisdom -- or were they words of anger -- by Dens Park manager
Jim Duffy at half-time certainly worked the oracle.
Premier Division Kilmarnock didn't know what hit them as the Dark
Blues registered three goals in a blistering 20-minute spell.
Yet until Duffy got to work on his side at the interval, this shock
result never appeared likely.
In a low-key first half Killie deserved their lead without ever
looking a division above Dundee. The visitors led from the thirty-third
minute when Dundee's French keeper Michel Pageaud made a hash of
collecting an innocuous left wing cross from Reilly. Following a frantic
scramble, Henry struck the post before Paul Wright finally forced the
ball over the line.
Although Dundee operated an admirable 4-2-4 formation, with a further
two strikers on the bench, their front men struggled to make an impact
due to the midfield being outnumbered and unable to provide decent
service.
All this changed after the break, however, as Cargill and Wieghorst
gained a valuable toehold in the middle of the park.
Dundee equalised when the visiting defence left a Tosh cross for each
other to clear and George Shaw stepped in to score with a shot which
entered the net off the far post.
Fourteen minutes later Dundee's Danish internationalist Morten
Wieghorst swept the ball high into the net after Hamilton redirected a
Cargill corner into his path.
In the seventy-first minute Jim Hamilton should have finished the tie
when he intercepted a weak passback by Black but shot straight at
Lekovic.
Two minutes later, however, the Scotland under-21 internationalist did
finish the tie when he rose high at the far post to head in a cross from
Tosh after the Dundee substitute had been sent clear from a magnificent
pass from goalkeeper Pageaud.
Killie attempted a grandstand finish when they threw everyone forward,
but the home defence, magnificently marshalled by Manley and skipper
Neil Duffy, held firm.
To round off a miserable evening for Kilmarnock, they had two players
booked. Mitchell for dissent and Whitworth for a foul on Wieghorst.
DUNDEE -- Pageaud, Bain, Cargill, Manley, Wieghorst, Duffy, Shaw,
Vrto, Britton, Hamilton, McCann. Substitutes -- Tosh, McQueen, I
Anderson.
KILMARNOCK -- Lekovic, Skilling, Black, Montgomerie, Whitworth,
Connor, Mitchell, Henry, Wright, Brown, Reilly. Substitutes -- D
Anderson, Holt, Roberts.
Referee -- John Rowbotham (Kirkcaldy).

Hearts 2, Dunfermline 1
HEARTS captain Craig Levein sat in the dressing room with a brace on
his damaged knee as his club celebrated reaching the quarter-finals of
the Coca-Cola Cup.
Levein had been stretchered off against Dunfermline 15 minutes from
the end and Hearts manager Jim Jeffries said: ''It looked bad. We think
that he has damaged his knee ligaments and if that is the case it could
be very serious.
''At the moment he has a brace on the knee to hold things in place.
Once the swelling goes down we will send him for an X-ray.
''It would be a major blow for the club if he was to be out for any
length of time and it would be a tragedy for the player.''
Levein has had a career scarred by serious injuries. This was the last
thing he looked for as yet another new era began at Tynecastle.
Thirty-nine-year-old Henry Smith shed the years at Tynecastle to help
Hearts into the quarter-finals of the cup. The Edinburgh side edged
through, but only some super saves from the seemingly ageless keeper
made that possible.
He was magnificent at the start of the second half, and even after his
team had gone in front in the fifty-fifth minute, when Dave McPherson
scored the goal which eventually proved to be the winner, he continued
to defy Dunfermline.
However, while Smith was performing his heroics, Hearts fans worried
not just about the result, but also about Levein's injury. The
international defender had gone into a tackle with Stewart Petrie and
then crashed to the ground. A stretcher was called on and Levein was
carried off.
Even without him Hearts were able to survive with Smith taking the
hero's role.
The Tynecastle side had signed David Winnie from Aberdeen hours before
the game, played him, and the new boy helped to propel them to a
second-minute lead.
The goal came when Ivo Den Biemen misjudged a cross as he tried to
head the ball back to his goalkeeper and fellow countryman Guido Van De
Kamp. The ball dropped short, and there was David Hagen getting to it
first and blasting a shot into the roof of the net.
Seventeen minutes afterwards Den Biemen did make up for that mistake.
As the Hearts defence tried unsuccessfully to spring an offside trap he
moved clear on to a pass from Allan Moore and, with only Smith to beat,
guided the ball into goal.
The second half began with signs of the form of Smith which would
eventually end Dunfermline's challenge.
He saved from Greg Shaw in 48 minutes and then recovered to smother a
shot from Petrie which had been blocked by McPherson.
In 55 minutes Winnie crossed from the right and McPherson shot past
Van De Kamp to put the premier division side back into the lead.
And now Smith came into his own.He saved a free kick from Marc Millar,
then bettered that with a one-handed save from a Greg Shaw header.
And, from then until the end of the game, he strung together a series
of confident saves which kept Dunfermline at bay.
Even in a brief spell towards the end, when Neil Berry had taken over
from Levein, and then had to go off himself and Hearts were down to 10
men, the Edinburgh side held firm.
Always the defence seemed aware of the inspiration being provided by
the veteran behind them.
Both teams tried their substitutes in that second half. Dunfermline
used Derek Fleming to replace Mark McCulloch, and then Neale Cooper took
over from Shaw.
Berry was sent on by Hearts for the injured Levein and then Alan
Lawrence appeared for the last 10 minutes and John Colquhoun went off.
None of the changes made any great difference to the play.
There were three bookings, Den Biemen of Dunfermline and Winnie and
Colquhoun of Hearts.
Dunfermline, meanwhile, are left to concentrate once more on promotion
from the first division.
The way they played last night underlined that they are not far away
from premier division standard.
Against another keeper, at another ground, on another night, they
might have found themselves still in the Coca-Cola Cup.
HEARTS -- Smith, Locke, Winnie, Levein, McPherson, Hamilton,
Colquhoun, Mackay, Hagen, Johnston, Robertson. Substitutes -- Lawrence,
Berry, Nelson.
DUNFERMLINE -- Van de Kamp, Den Bieman, Millar, McCathie, Tod, Smith,
Moore, McNamara, Shaw, Petrie, McCulloch. Substitutes -- Fleming,
Cooper, Westwater.
Referee -- KW Clark (Paisley)

Falkirk 1, Aberdeen 4
A NIGHT of drama at Brockville ended yet again with Falkirk high and
dry at the hands of Aberdeen, who are safe and sound in the last eight
of the Coca-Cola Cup.
In a niggling 90 minutes in which referee Willie Young was the busiest
man on the park, Aberdeen's passage into the quarter-finals was
simplified by the red-carding of Bairns' keeper Tony Parks after 33
minutes.
As well as that ordering off, there were yellow cards for John Clark
and Steve Kirk of Falkirk, plus Theo Snelders and Peter Hetherston for
Aberdeen.
Afterwards, Falkirk manager John Lambie spoke about the ''strange''
decision concerning Parks. Referee Young originally had given a goal
kick to the home side. ''The players are upset about the decision. It
seemed a strange one. The referee gave us the kick then changed his
mind, but that's his right.''
History, neither recent not past, was on Falkirk's side. Only five
days ago, they were on the receiving end of a defeat by the Dons which
was a shade more convincing than the final 3-2 scoreline indicated.
Lambie had labelled his side's defending at the weekend as a joke, but
at least then, they did not go so far as to put the ball in their own
net. They did this time, with Clark the unfortunate victim as the
visitors took a sixth-minute lead.
Joe Miller was fouled out on the right wing and challenged by Booth,
Clark nodded the ball past a helpless Tony Parks.
Falkirk were thrown a lifeline in 23 minutes when Gary Smith brought
down Steve Kirk in the penalty area. Peter Hetherston and Theo Snelders
were both booked before Mo Johnston stepped up to score from the spot.
Ten minutes after having pulled themselves back into the game,
however, Falkirk once again had a mountain to climb. Peter Hetherston
chased the ball through the middle. Parks ran from his goal, and
although he was outside the box, it seemed a fair challenge which the
keeper made.
Referee Young at first looked as if he agreed with that assessment,
but having had his attention drawn by the stand-side linesman, he
changed his mind and sent off the Bairns keeper for deliberate hand
ball.
Neil Inglis took over in goal and did well to make a couple of stops
to prevent the Dons going back in front.
But in 39 minutes the substitute goalkeeper was beaten. A Joe Miller
cross from the right landed at the feet of Booth, who scored.
The match had always been simmering, but threatened to bubble over as
half-time approached, and after an incident between John Clark and Billy
Dodds the first half ended with players from both teams leaving the
field pointing the finger at each other and Dons' manager Roy Aitken
coming on to escort Dodds up the tunnel.
Dons' full back Colin Woodthorpe scored his side's third with a left
foot shot in 59 minutes for his first goal since arriving at Pittodrie.
Joe Miller added a fourth with a late solo run.
FALKIRK -- Parks, Clark, Napier, Oliver, McLaughlin, McKenzie,
McGowan, Kirk, McDonald, Johnston, Elliot. Substitutes -- Rice,
Henderson, N Inglis.
ABERDEEN -- Snelders, McKimmie, Woodthorpe, Hetherston, J Inglis,
Smith, Miller, Jess, Booth, Dodds, Glass. Substitutes -- Thomson,
McKinnon, Watt.
Referee -- W S G Young (Clarkston).

THE new season begins on Saturday with the first day's play in the new
national premier league. Contested by the top four finishers each from
last season's north and south divisions one, the competition should be
the catalyst for a higher proportion of competitive matches and
sustained interest throughout the season.
Clubs have now taken the plunge on the national league format and with
a new three-year deal secure with sponsors Marine Harvest, the future
looks to be set fair, although the set-up has been introduced only on a
one-year pilot basis.
A flat rate #2 admission fee has been recommended by the Camanachd
Association's Executive Council. The fee is not compulsory and it is up
to clubs whether they apply it.
Several administrative difficulties still threaten to disrupt
proceedings. No fewer than a dozen clubs, including three premier teams,
have failed to supply the Camanachd Association with their registered
lists of players. Technically, no players can take the field this year
without being registered and having paid the new Association
registration fee, which was introduced after last season's annual
meeting of clubs.
Perhaps more worrying in the long term is the continuing shortage of
referees. This is to be met head-on by the Association, with another
recruitment campaign being launched as soon as possible. Association
secretary Alister MacIntyre admitted: ''We may have to suspend division
three in the north on the first day because we we could do with up to 15
more referees.''
The pick of the premier action is at Newtonmore, where Oban Camanachd,
last year's beaten Camanachd Cup finalists, are the visitors.

LIFE outside the limelight at the US Open suits Mary Pierce and
Michael Stich just fine as the darkhorse contenders position themselves
for an ambush of the favourites.
Monica Seles and Steffi Graf are grabbing all the attention on the
women's side, and Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras are the hot duo in the
men's competition -- a scenario that sits well with the sixth-seeded
Pierce and eighth seed Stich.
''There is no pressure on me, all the attention is on Seles and
Graf,'' Pierce said after trouncing Tatyana Jecmenica of Yugoslavia 6-3,
6-0 yesterday at the National Tennis Centre to reach the third round.
''I'm very happy. People don't expect anything from me.''
Stich, who smashed Spain's Javier Sanchez 6-2, 6-3, 6-0, in his
first-round match, seconded the sentiment. ''All the attention is
focused on Agassi and Sampras,'' Stich said about the top two men's
seeds, winners of the last two Opens.
Pierce and Stich share other similarities. Both have tasted Grand Slam
success -- Pierce winning her first Grand Slam title at this year's
Australian Open, and Stich winning at Wimbledon in 1991. Both were also
Grand Slam runners-up last year, Pierce at the French and Stich here at
the US Open.
Pierce and Stich have also battled back from injury, and both are
eager to taste Grand Slam success once again.
Stich, 26, defaulted a match earlier this month in a hardcourt
tournament in New Haven after pulling a stomach muscle. Rest and a
return to Germany for relaxation seem to have rejuvenated him.
Since her Australian Open triumph, Pierce has struggled through a
groin injury, a kidney infection, and a crisis of confidence.
But trips to a sports psychologist following a second-round defeat at
Wimbledon, intense workouts with a new trainer and the loss of about
13lb has Pierce primed and raring to go.
Pierce has not won a tournament since her Melbourne triumph. But in
the background, out of the Seles-Graf glare at Flushing Meadow, is just
where she wants to be for another title run. Results:
Men's singles, first round -- Michael Chang (US) beat Gianluca Pozzi
(Italy) 6-0, 6-1, 6-0; Frederik Fetterlein (Denmark) beat Jordi Burillo
(Spain) 6-2, 2-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2; Andrei Chesnokov (Russia) beat MaliVai
Washington (U.S.) 6-2, 6-4, 6-4; Michael Stich (Germany) beat Javier
Sanchez (Spain) 6-2, 6-3,6-0; Mark Woodforde (Australia) beat Kris
Goossens (Belgium) 6-3, 6-3, 6-4; M Tebbutt (Aus) beat A Jarryd (Swe)
6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
Women's singles, second round -- Mary Pierce (France) beat Tatyana
Jecmenica (Yugoslavia) 6-3, 6-0; Martina Hingis (Switzerland) beat
Magdalena Maleeva (Bulgaria ) 4-6, 6-4, 6-2; Patricia Hy Boulais

PLANS to form a Scottish Rugby Clubs' Association came to fruition
last night after a meeting at Perthshire RFC, where representatives from
many of the 70 national league sides agreed to provide themselves with a
''self help'' organisation along similar lines to that which already
exists for clubs in the four premier divisions, writes Derek Douglas.
Cartha Queen's Park president Alan Irons will chair the new
association's shadow committee until the first general meeting in March,
when office bearers will be elected.
The SRCA stresses that it is not a rival for the Scottish Rugby Union
but, mirroring sentiments expressed at the SRU annual general meeting in
June, there is a feeling that the Union is not catering for clubs as
well as it might do.
* SCOTLAND will send a team to the Hong Kong sevens in March next year
in preparation for the RWC tournament which will take place at the same
venue in 1997. The Scots will also figure in a qualification tournament
in one of three scheduled locations, Lisbon, Dubai or Uruguay.

MANAGER Bryan Robson launched a scathing attack on referee Robbie Hart
last night after his Middlesbrough team lost 1-0 to Newcastle.
His anger centred on a challenge by defender Darren Peacock on
midfielder Jamie Pollock.
''I feel we were robbed. It was a blatant penalty,'' said Robson.
''But the referee seemed to give every 50-50 in favour of Newcastle.''
Newcastle's Kevin Keegan said: ''Darren said it was not a penalty, it
is not a major issue.''
With Leeds only drawing, Newcastle went outright top through a goal by
#6m Les Ferdinand, who was left out of England's squad to face Colombia
next week.
It followed a cross from Frenchman David Ginola. Keegan said: ''I am
very pleased. The chairman asked me before I signed Ginola: 'What is he
like?' I replied: 'Once we get him, we will find out what he is like.'
He has pace, trickery, and vision. You are not supposed to have these
three qualities.''
Ginola was one of the players Celtic were chasing over the summer. So
was Belgian Marc Degryse, who opened the scoring for Sheffield Wednesday
last night on only his second appearance them. But Wimbledon hit back
for a 2-2 draw.
Tommy Widdrington -- a Newcastle fan as a schoolboy -- earned
Southampton their first point with an equaliser against Leeds at The
Dell.
Former Celts Stuart Slater and Alex Mathie grabbed two goals each in
Ipswich's 4-1 win over Stoke in the Endsleigh League first division.
Slater had scored just three times since moving from Celtic nearly two
years ago.
* BULGARIAN striker Hristo Stoichkov's introduction to the Italian Cup
was painful as Parma lost 3-0 to humble Palermo in the second round.
Three other Serie A sides fell. Third-division Fiorenzuola beat Torino
2-1, and serie B clubs Bologna and Reggiana saw off Roma 1-0 and Bari
2-0 respectively.
* FRENCH striker Jean-Pierre Papin, who has struggled in Germany
because of injury, scored a spectacular goal in a 2-0 win over Bayer
Uerdingen taking Bayern Munich two points clear at the top of the
league.

IF you fancy backing Double Eclipse for the St Leger on Saturday week,
the word now is -- hold on.
The Goodwood Cup runner-up, quoted at 8-1 ante-post, was taken out of
the betting yesterday after trainer Mark Johnston announced the colt a
doubtful runner for the final classic of the season.
''We thought the problem was heat in a foot but it seems that is not
the case,'' said Johnston.
''We can't find out what's wrong but he's not quite sound and if he's
not cantering by the weekend we'll give up.''
Johnston may still be represented in the big race by Jural but is
awaiting confirmation of her plans from owner Sheikh Mohammed.
Presenting is now 6-4 favourite (from 15-8), with Irish Derby fifth
Classic Cliche at 9-2 (from 7-1), the same price as Italian Derby winner
Luso (from 7-1).

GREG Norman, who recently accused Mark McCumber of ''cheating'' in the
World Series tournament in Ohio, is determined that the incident will
not be ''pushed into history.''
Norman said that McCumber had repaired a spike mark and refused to
sign his card at the end of the round. McCumber said that he was
removing an insect and was given the benefit of the doubt but his card
had to be signed by a US Tour official.
''I have written to the US Board members and the Policy Board because
I do not want to see the matter die. Technically it's history but I do
not want to see anything like this happen again. I do not want to see
this pushed into history.
''Nobody is above the game of golf. I have never seen anything so
blatant in my life. The officials had to give the player the benefit of
the doubt because it was my word against his. But I'm still mad about
this incident.''
* TWO more leading European golfers may be able to play up to 12
tournaments every year in America after the US PGA Tour approved a plan
to open up their events to foreigners.
The tour's tournament policy board has increased the number of annual
exemptions for non-members to seven, two more than at present.
* PAUL Alexander and Kenny Fairbairn were the only two Scots who made
the cut at the British assistants' championship at The Warwickshire
yesterday, finishing seven shots behind the winner, Ian Sparkes. Scores:
284 -- I Sparkes (Dudsbury) 74, 71, 71, 68. 285 -- J Cook (Leamington

ABERDEENSHIRE last night were found guilty by the Scottish Counties'
Cricket Board, after having received ''new evidence,'' of failing to
fulfil their fixture against West Lothian on August 12 -- a complete
reversal of an earlier meeting of the officials which had cleared the
Mannofield club of any impropriety under Clause 13 of the constitution.
West Lothian were awarded the match after the meeting at The Arns,
Alloa, last night, and almost ironically, it could mean the Boghall club
taking the title with the award of 25 points. It puts them just ahead of
the now second-placed Ayrshire, with Aberdeenshire down to fourth place.
The dispute centred round the fact that Aberdeenshire, with several
top players unavailable for the match at Boghall, turned up with only
seven. Four others -- later suspended by the club -- were said to be
stranded because their hired car broke down at Stonehaven.
Aberdeenshire skipper Colin Mitchell admitted he was ''shattered'' at
the outcome -- although not surprised.
He said: ''We as a club brought it upon ourselves through the
dishonesty of four of our members. It is an action which they now
regret.''
Board spokesman Tom Gibson, the secretary/treasurer, refused to say
what the ''new evidence'' was, but I understand that an employee of the
company who hired the car to the four players made a statement.
Meanwhile, on the playing front, debut man Drew Parsons hit a century
as Scotland B took command against the Yorkshire Cricket Academy in
Bradford yesterday.
The Ayrshire youngster rescued the Scots after a shaky start as Jim
Love's side went on to declare at 259 for seven. His dream day continued
with two catches, one a blinder in the gully to remove danger man James
Middlebrooke. Scores:
Scotland B 259 for seven decl (D Parsons 117, G Reifer 49, I Philip
35; R Robinson 6-53); Yorkshire C A 205 for four decl (N Russell 71, R
Robinson 63no; C Wright 3-42).

Brides may get a #1000 dress for #500, with the seller recouping some
of her initial outlay
AFTER the big day, what happens to the bridal gown? In the last couple
of years there has been a trend towards selling-on gowns by brides who
seem to value extra cash over sentimentality.
Classified ads fairly hum with the selection of dresses for sale, and
a few shops have popped up offering second-hand gowns of some
distinction to brides-to-be who perhaps cannot afford to buy new.
The wide-ranging array of designs available these days means that
second-hand gowns need not be dreary and cheap-looking, with many
exquisite silk dresses now appearing for a second or even third showing.
Prices for quality dresses in the second-hand sector may even be
comparable to new gowns at the cheaper end of the market, so brides may
get a #1000 dress for #500, with the seller recouping some of her
initial outlay.
Other brides are taking the practical route of re-using their dresses,
and so they tend to go for styles which can live to fight another day,
either shortened for occasional wear or dyed to emerge seductively as
evening wear.
The recent steady increase of straighter styles which lend themselves
well to being re-drafted for further use may not be just a fashion
dictate, but also a subtle pointer to the increasing awareness of brides
that such a special dress should have the potential for further use.
Traditional styles can, of course, also be made to go the extra mile
as evening dresses by the careful removal of overtly bridal touches.
Indeed many designers, particularly those creating specially-tailored
individual designs are often aware that the dress envisioned by the
bride-to-be will have more than one outing, even if this is never
stated.
Underskirts are put together robustly to be unveiled from under lace
tunics and bodices as attractive in their own right, and sleeves are
adroitly stitched on in a manner which is easy to unpick.
Bolero jackets can always be separated from a dress and dyed to
provide several options, while many of the recent styles with partial
overskirts can very easily ring the changes with little effort.
Reselling designer bridalwear makes perfect sense to Jane Anderson,
owner of the Blue Moon Dress Agency's first franchise operation in
Aberdeen.
The Agency name was established in Glasgow five years ago by June
Russell, who saw friends and family splashing out on designer bridal
wear only to look at it with a sigh afterwards.
Blue Moon has since gone from strength to strength, allowing former
brides to recoup some of their dress money and others the chance to
stride out in designer gowns at a more affordable price.
Its success has now spawned a franchise operation, only the second in
Scotland to be established by a woman.
According to June Russell, franchising Blue Moon was the obvious step
to take once the Glasgow operation was firmly established. She said:
''Blue Moon has all the essential features for a successful franchise; a
good business idea, relatively low start-up costs, and a strong brand.''
The Aberdeen operation will operate from spacious premises in the
city's Belmont Street. Owner Jane Anderson said: ''The Blue Moon concept
is perfectly pitched for the cost conscious 90s.
But then again, there are always the romantics who want to hold onto
their bridal gowns, perhaps to pass them on to another generation
unadulterated and unsullied by dye.
Nowadays these brides can do a bit better than a polythene bag stored
in the attic in which the dress can -- invariably -- rot away and be
revealed to the harsh light twenty years down the line as yellowing and
fragile.
The Empty Box Company, which is based in Surrey, offers an actual
Wedding Dress Box. Sceptics -- particularly men -- would probably argue
that any old box would do. But they would be wrong.
Most cardboard, wood or coloured materials contain some degree of acid
which will be taken up by the purer fabric of the dress and cause
staining and distress to the material over a period of time.
The Wedding Dress Box is not only beautifully presented, it is also
made from specially-milled cardboard which does not contain any of the
offending acid or alkali which can do the damage.
It has also been approved by the musuem established to commemorate
that most long-lasting of Royal marriages -- the Victoria &amp; Albert.

THE #150m Buchanan Galleries shopping scheme could significantly
weaken other Glasgow retail pitches. Union Street, Renfield Street,
Trongate and parts of Sauchiehall Street could all lose shoppers to the
new centre and to the established shopping areas of Argyle Street and
Buchanan Street.
Scheduled for completion in 1999, the much-delayed development next to
the Royal Concert Hall faces tough competition from the massive Braehead
out-of-town scheme. Glasgow's men and women of property are convinced
that both of these new retail schemes, one in the city centre and the
other on the outskirts, will succeed -- but at a cost.
Although their developers do not like to admit it, these two retail
giants will be slugging it out for the next three or four years in a bid
to attract retail tenants. Yet Glasgow is already almost unique in the
UK in having (in Argyle Street and Sauchiehall Street) two key shopping
pitches with many major retail chains represented on both. Where will
the retailers come from to fill the two new schemes?
It is known that a number of retailers from the south are keen to get
into Glasgow, but they won't be enough to fill both centres. The likely
answer is a weakening of marginal city-centre shopping pitches as
retailers head for the new centres.
Each can offer considerable drawing power. On its riverfront site near
Renfrew, Braehead will be anchored by the UK retail dream team of Marks
&amp; Spencer and Sainsbury. Planning restrictions could make it the last of
the big out of town schemes, so retailers seeking outlets in such
centres north of the Border might have to seize this opportunity of
representation.
Back on Buchanan Street, joint developers AMP Asset Management and
Slough Estates wheeled out their own big puncher last week -- a 300,000
sq ft anchor store to be occupied by the shoppers' darling, the John
Lewis Partnership. The scheme also plugs the biggest gap in Glasgow city
centre's main shopping pitches, the gulf between Sauchiehall Street and
the lower end of Buchanan Street -- with its direct access to Argyle
Street. By the end of the century Glasgow's two parallel shopping
streets will be locked into a new ''Z-shaped'' prime retail pitch, with
pedestrians flowing between Argyle Street and Sauchiehall Street via
Buchanan Street.
The losers could be Union Street and Renfield Street, while the ailing
western stretch of Sauchiehall Street beyond the pedestrianised zone
will be further weakened.
As shoppers concentrate on the new St Enoch Centre/Buchanan
Street/Sauchiehall Street axis, Trongate could see reduced trade.
''Buchanan Galleries is going to bring 1.2 million sq ft of new retail
floorspace into a city centre which has about six million sq ft already
-- an increase of around 15% to 20%, that's bound to have an impact on
the city centre,'' says Alan Macbeth, director of retail and leisure
with surveyors DTZ Debenham Thorpe. ''It will be difficult to get real
rental growth in Glasgow for several years because of the sheer level of
supply. But in the end, it's got to be good for the city.''
He says that he is ''90% certain'' that both Braehead and Buchanan
Galleries will be let, or even pre-let.
Retail specialist Fiona Hamilton of surveyors Hamilton Glen says that
while the John Lewis store brings a great asset to the city centre, it
is not the end of the story. ''They've brought a fantastic retailer to
Glasgow, but they've still got 50 or 60 shop units to fill although many
of the big multiples already have two outlets in the city -- and at a
time when groups like Burtons are cutting back. And some of the new
innovative retailers like Gap and Racing Green don't want to be in
shopping centres, they want to be out there on the street.''
Having brought a clutch of specialist retailers into Scotland, she is
not convinced that many of them are willing to pay the sort of prices
that Buchanan Galleries might require. ''There's rumours of rentals of
up to #100 per sq ft per annum, then you have to add in the service
charges and rates -- you could be talking #150 per sq ft or more.''
Speaking for the developers of Buchanan Galleries, John Hamilton of
Healey &amp; Baker, joint letting agents for Buchanan Galleries along with
Montagu Evans, says: ''We believe that these schemes are entirely
different from each other. It's fair to say that impact of the Buchanan
Galleries on the city centre will be fairly substantial.''

SHEER size and diversity make the renamed Rexam plc group an
international force to be reckoned with in almost any market terms.
It employs 28,000 people, has a current annual turnover of #2.2
billion and consists of l30 companies scattered over sixteen countries,
including over 50 companies in the United Kingdom.
Growth continues. What Rexam describes as ''a period of substantial
investment'' includes the construction of a new state-of-the-art plant
in the United States, the recent acquisition of a company in the
Netherlands and the setting up of a new joint venture in Asia.
Rexam chairman, Michael Woodhouse, says: ''Rexam as a new name for the
company is, I believe, both a symbol of what has been achieved and a
necessary step to enable the company to grow, capitalise on its newly
developed strengths, and compete to maximum effect in international
markets.
''We are investing heavily in our main international businesses -- the
four coated products businesses and medical and cosmetic packaging --
with the confidence that their medium to long-term prospects justify
increased development costs now.''
Rexam is first and foremost a packaging, print and coated products
group, particularly known for its skill in advanced design and
manufacture of components and for producing for its customers specialist
solutions which call on many technologies.
That is particularly illustrated by the spread of businesses within
the group, including engineered building products, and which it
describes as ''linked across the world by common or related technologies
or markets''. Glasgow's contribution to the overall scene is healthily
significant but only one corner of the whole.
In England, activities range from cheque book and security printing to
paperback book printing, making telephone cards, and the manufacture,
sale and installation of PVC-U windows and doors.
A Rexam company in the Czech Republic and another in Poland are
similarly involved in the making and installation of windows and doors.
Companies in Germany and Italy manufacture aerosol valves. A Canadian
company is one of several where metallised films and paper are produced.
Continuing to sample at random, Rexam companies in Puerto Rico produce
flexible medical packaging and printed folding cartons. A long list of
United States companies includes one which produces metal connector
plates for buildings and another which manufactures child-resistant
dispensing and standard screw closures.
''In fact, we now operate half of our business on a global basis,'' is
the comment from David Lyon, group chief executive. ''To do so properly
we must use a single name. The choice of Rexam plc for the group is a
timely and pragmatic decision.''
A group which less than ten years ago would probably have been rightly
described as an industrial holding company for a range of relatively
unconnected businesses has been carefully reshaped and reconstructed to
become a series of ''business clusters'', many of them linked by both
technology and customers.
There has been an increasing and deliberate bias towards products
which are difficult to make, at the same time as the development of a
common style of doing business.
''With every day that passes, our group business penetrates more
deeply into world-wide markets,'' says Bill Sinclair. ''Today we serve
global, national, regional and local customers. These customers want to
deal with fewer suppliers so that they can establish long-term
relationships. This is the way that all business is going.
''There can be no doubt that the ability to use one name and one
identity across all of our businesses worldwide is a competitive
advantage. The need for one presence with one set of values is the way
ahead.''

VERY sound commercial reasons lie behind the change of name, affecting
most companies throughout the group. The beginnings go back to l984 when
the Bowater Corporation was divided into two separate companies.
The newsprint, coated paper and pulp businesses in North America
became Bowater Inc., listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The rest of
the businesses throughout the world became Bowater Industries plc, known
as Bowater plc.
At that time Bowater Inc. assumed the exclusive right to use the name
Bowater in North and South America, while Bowater plc retained the right
to the name elsewhere.
Three years later the British-based Bowater plc acquired Rexham Inc in
the United States and began grouping its trading activities in North
America around that company.
''At the time of the demerger, the US interests of Bowater plc were
modest,'' said Bill Sinclair. ''The businesses that now make up Rexham
in the United States have sales of $l.2bn and represent 40% of Bowater's
turnover.''
Which in turn has caused problems from time to time as Bowater plc has
grown.
''Major multi-national customers have had to deal with the group as
Rexham in the North and South Americas and as Bowater elsewhere,'' said
Bill Sinclair. ''It is important to be able to talk to international
companies under one banner.''
''There is one aspect we call the Velcro factor,'' said Bill Sinclair.
''When any one company in the group is selling to a new customer then
that company will automatically suggest that another part of our group
might help in other areas.''
Tom Shand, sales director of the present John Horn Ltd, sees the
future as being ''a new name with a long tradition behind it and a
company that is well equipped, well invested, and with our people as our
most important asset.''
Alan Hair, sales director of McCorquodale (Scotland) Ltd, has at least
as much reason as his colleague to welcome the change to Rexam. In
recent years the Glasgow printing firm has taken a major stride in
servicing the electronics industry.
What began in the late 70s as a search for a new niche market suddenly
succeeded in the 80s when the computer firm Compaq, then recently
arrived at Erskine, gave the company a contract to produce documentation
for its products.
''It was a new, highly specialised market and we had a massive
learning curve to complete,'' said Alan Hair. ''They were the first,
others followed, including JVC, Panasonic, Grundig and Samsung. Anyone
who manufactures an electronic item, anything from a TV set to a
microwave, needs an instruction manual to accompany it wherever it may
go in the world.''
Today such manuals and documentation constitute 70% of McCorquodale's
turnover.

EUROPEAN proposals for tightening controls on the payment of Sheep
Annual Premium were criticised yesterday by Brian Pack, chief executive
of the ANM group, operator of Aberdeen and Northern Marts.
Mr Pack took the opportunity of a visit by the Earl of Lindsay,
Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, to voice his concerns about the
serious impact the proposals would have on the sheep industry. He said
later that he had had a sympathetic hearing from the Minister.
Speaking at Thainstone Agricultural Centre, Inverurie, Mr Pack said he
was surprised the Brussels plans had not stimulated more of an outcry
from the industry. There seemed to be a general feeling that the planned
changes were a fait accompli. ''That is a dangerous position to start
from,'' he warned.
Farmers' concerns are centred on proposals to abolish one of the two
retention periods during which a breeding ewe may not be sold after the
payment of SAP, currently worth about #21 per ewe.
A move to a single retention period, probably finishing in early May,
would limit the industry's options, he said. ''It would mean early lamb
production systems would be almost uneconomic. Everyone would be forced
into the same period for casting their ewes.''
At the moment one of the attractions of the early lambing system was
that producers taking that option could get their lambs away early and
into a different market.
The UK was definitely the sheep producer of Europe now and it was
important to maintain flexibility within the production system, he said.
The European proposals follow an audit of the way SAP is administered
in the UK. The double retention period was perceived to give opportunity
for fraud -- with the same animal being paid for twice if it changed
flocks between the two periods. Mr Pack emphasised that there was no
evidence of fraud but the present system was deemed to offer the
opportunity for it.
Having one retention period was, from an administrative point of view,
the easy solution, he admitted. It took no account of the impact on the
industry, however. The idea of individual identification of each animal,
which had also been proposed as an anti-fraud measure was totally
impractical, he added.
The main event at Thainstone yesterday was the annual ''spectacular''
-- a show and sale of calves and store cattle suitable for further
exhibition purposes.
Iain Clark, agricultural manager for the Clydesdale Bank, the show's
sponsor, took a bullish view of the industry. Beef producers were
enjoying a period of relative financial stability and could look forward
to returns continuing broadly in line with those achieved in the past
year. Any reductions in market prices were likely to be balanced by
increases in beef special premium and suckler cow premium payments, he
said.
''There is still enormous scope within our beef system for many
farmers to improve returns by maximising the number of cattle which are
produced at the top end of the quality spectrum,'' he said. ''Quality
stock of the type sold here today are still in short supply and, as a
consequence, attract considerably higher prices than are paid for more
average animals.
''Long-term prosperity will be achieved by those businesses which
produce consistently high quality beef at consistently low costs.''
Mr Clark said he did not foresee many livestock producers shifting the
emphasis of their operations into the arable sector. Most farmers
operated on a long-term basis. While harvest conditions had been first
class this year, it had to be remembered that in 1993 conditions had
been very poor, with some arable farmers still combining in November.
''People remember that and are less likely to swing the balance of
their enterprise too far in the direction of the arable sector.''

SCOTCH whisky exports rose more than 5% by volume during the first six
months of this year and exports by value rose even faster, setting the
stage for a record full-year performance, the Scotch Whisky Association
said yesterday. A spokesman for the association said the value of whisky
exports was rising even faster than volume because more and more whisky
was being bottled in Scotland instead of being shipped in bulk.
Whisky bottled in Scotland now accounts for 90% of the value of all
whisky sold overseas and 70% of the volume.
The value of whisky sold overseas climbed to an all-time high of
#2200m last year, despite a slight decline in the volume shipped to
252.2 million litres of pure alcohol equivalent (mlpa).
The spokesman declined to give forecasts for this year but said
exports were on track to exceed last year's figures.
The association said Customs and Excise figures showed that whisky
exports to countries outside the EU grew 6% by volume to 69.8 mlpa in
the first six months of this year.
But sales by value rose 13% to #630.5m, with emerging markets such as
India, China, Taiwan and Brazil showing the biggest percentage
increases.
Exports to the US, Scotch's largest single market, were flat at #116m,
but shipments of malt whisky were up 40%.
Official data on whisky exports to the EU during the first half of
this year is not yet available. But the Scotch Whisky Association said
its own figures showed exports to the EU rose nearly 5% by volume to
40.8 mlpa.
Exports to Greece showed a 3% decline and shipments to Germany were
flat, but there were healthy increases in deliveries to the other main
European markets, it said. France rose 5%, Spain was up 8% and Italy
took 13% more whisky than during the first six months of 1994.
Booming exports are helping offset a nosedive in domestic whisky
consumption following tax rises on spirits in the December mini Budget.
Releases of whisky from bonded warehouses for sale in the UK fell 22%
between January and May.

P&amp;O European Ferries, the largest ferry operator on the cross-Channel
route, was quick to refute claims made in Paris by Eurotunnel's
co-chairman, Patrick Ponsolle, yesterday that its Le Shuttle service had
held on to a lead in the Dover-Calais freight market and also had become
the leading transporter of cars.
Overall, P&amp;O European Ferries reckons to have carried about 170,000
cars on the Dover-Calais route in August. While the hot weather in
Britain and the strength of the French franc has hit cross-channel
business generally, P&amp;O regards it as inconceivable that Eurotunnel
could have done better unless it was relying on isolated daily
statistics, even allowing for the novelty impact of Le Shuttle.
Eurotunnel is expected to announce its August traffic figures early
next week but the company was tight-lipped on the Paris report. Whatever
the ins and outs of the cross-Channel trade and however crucial this may
be to the company's progress, the discussions in September with the
creditor banks are once again the focus of attention because another
refinancing package looks to be in prospect.
The leading banks have made clear they are prepared to continue to
support the company but, since the alternative would be receivership,
this is scarcely surprising.
Eurotunnel is also keeping mum about this but in his interview Mr
Ponsolle did say the first results of these talks would probably be
given at the start of October when the company publishes its first-half
results, though no definite date has yet been set. Eurotunnel has
already announced it is to issue a revised 1995 profits forecast along
with its interim figures and this has not added to confidence.
Certainly the Eurotunnel saga, which from the point of view of both
the long-suffering shareholders and the banks has been a fraught one,
looks set to continue as the company seems to stumble from one financial
crisis to another.
This could be compounded by a conflict of interests between the banks
and shareholders, who have seen the price fall from a high of 325p this
year to a low of 134p, though they have since recovered a little and
yesterday stood at 168p, down 1p. This is still less, though, than half
their level at the time of the rights issue in May 1994.
Most of Eurotunnel's small shareholders are based in France where they
control the majority of the equity, since right from the start the
project was probably regarded with much more patriotic fervour in France
than in the UK. But some of the company's UK-based private shareholders
announced recently that they were to set up an action group to represent
their interests ahead of the negotiations with the banks.
The main concern is that there could be a debt-for-equity swop which
would greatly dilute shareholders' interests. On the other hand, it
could also be argued it could at least prevent them being wiped out
altogether, which is another unpleasant possibility if no formula can be
agreed.
The basic problem for Eurotunnel, of course, is that it is so
debt-ridden, owing almost #8000m, that it needs to generate enormous
amounts of revenue merely to pay the annual interest costs of about
#650m. This means, too, that every little setback it suffers, even to
the extent of a delay on the Shuttle, receives considerable publicity
which does not help in the battle with the ferry companies for passenger
trade.
In its May 1994 rights issue prospectus, Eurotunnel predicted
full-year revenues of #525m but the figures are expected to fall well
below this, with estimates ranging from below #300m up to around #435m.
The current level of revenue, therefore, is not sufficient, which means
some form of refinancing or restructuring looks probable.
Access to the second tranche of #400m of credit available to the
company under its debt facility would help tide it over until next year
but then the same old problem would arise. Revenues are bound to grow
and Eurotunnel is taking market share from its ferry rivals, but it has
run up such a mountain of debt, it simply cannot catch up.
Short of some sort of state intervention, which in a crunch would
probably be more acceptable on the other side of the Channel than here,
swopping some debt for a form of equity might be the best solution from
Eurotunnel's point of view. Whether the banks would be amenable to this
is a moot point but at the end of the day even they may have little
choice.

WHEN the two long established and highly respected names --
McCorquodale (Scotland) Ltd and John Horn Ltd -- merge tomorrow under
their new banner of Rexam Cartons and Print Scotland Ltd, they will
acquire a new common telephone number, 0141-632-0999, and a FAX number
0141-632-8111.
What won't change is that behind the new international-style Rexam
name the same team as before will provide the same high quality of
service aimed at world-wide marketing.
For both, this is the latest chapter in long histories. In the case of
McCorquodale (Scotland) Ltd it is a story which goes back to 1846, when
George McCorquodale founded a printing company in Maxwell Street, close
to St Enoch railway station.
It was a shrewd choice. His firm made a speciality of printing railway
timetables and also carried out other railway-orientated work. As time
passed, it opened other branches serving English railway stations and
making a similar speciality of railway operational material.
But as the railway age of steam faded, the Maxwell Street firm became
more generalised in its approach. They turned from trains to buses, and
that continues today as a link. They print bus timetables for
Strathclyde and Stagecoach, despite their thriving and growing
specialist concentration on high-value products for the world-wide
electronics industry.
Their past history also includes a brief relationship with publisher
Robert Maxwell. For a spell he owned a 25% share of the company before
it was acquired by Norton Opax plc in l986. Three years later
McCorquodale was acquired again, this time by Bowater plc, and then in
l992 it left Maxwell Street to move in beside a fellow Bowater Group
company at Riverford Road, Pollokshaws.
Manufacturing activities, in addition to trail-blazing ISDN and Modem
facilities, range from digital artwork repro, Apple Mac and PC based, to
an extensive software library, sheet litho printing, foil blocking,
folding, saddle stitching, perfect and wiro binding.
Between them the two companies have a #20m a year turnover.
Printed carton manufacturers John Horn Ltd began as another Glasgow
family firm founded in l880 and for many years was located in Argyle
Street.
Becoming a limited company in l904, John Horn was acquired by
McCorquodale in l939 and then by Bowater in l989. Its spacious South
Side location has been steadily developed in terms of modern equipment
and plant, now CAD and CAG equipped. Horn products range from foil films
and exotic substrates to foil blockings, litho lam., cross lam., TM and
windowing and turnkey services.
A wide and prestigious variety of clients is led by distillery
companies from Allied Distillers, with printed carton runs measured in
tens of thousands.
A growing involvement in the chocolate and sugar confectionery market
includes Cadbury as a client. Other contracts range from Calvin Klein in
cosmetics to crystal and pottery packaging for Wedgwood, food cartons
for Premier Beverages and industrial clients include Compaq.
The carton team has a growing reputation for innovative solutions in
constructional design and the evaluation of cost and
performance-effective materials.
''The opportunity to access the Rexam portfolio is exciting,'' says
Tom Shand. ''The ability to offer the range of products from corrugate
to plastics is unique and means that we as Rexam can offer a
co-ordinated and effective total packaging solution.''
The two companies blend into their new joint identity with a total of
280 employees, many of whom already share parts of the combined factory
area and who, as a matter of routine, interchange activities as
required.
What's in a name? In the case of Rexam, the answer is about #2.5m
across the group. That is the estimated cost in requirements and
replacements, as the name Bowater fades from the scene. A deadly serious
marketing process is involved in the background starting tomorrow, when
all operating companies involved assume their new Rexam identity.
Everything within the group's activities will now carry one strictly
prepared visual and verbal style. Months of planning have gone into
ensuring that it will cover stationery and transport, packing, uniforms
and site signs, telephone directories, fax callbacks and telephone
answering machines will be similarly involved. Postal distribution,
franking machines and such items as flags and the varied needs of
international merchandising have all gone through a similar preparation
for the changeover.
Why Rexam? Selecting the new name to provide one global identity for
this #2.2bn group of companies was no easy matter. As chief executive
David Lyon said, it began with consultants being called in, committees
formed, and a process which led to a final meeting of senior executives
faced with a list of no less than 600 names.
First announced at a meeting in London in April of this year, the name
Rexam won shareholders' approval the following month, and Bowater
formally changed to Rexam in June.
David Lyon sums up the name change as: ''A way to bring us all
together under one common identity to take full advantage of future
opportunities, remembering that what we do well today we will be able to
do better tomorrow.''
One of the earlier actions once the change of name had been decided
was to explain exactly what was involved to all Bowater employees,
including its importance to long-term growth and security.
In Glasgow, that included a number of meetings with the combined
workforce, who had always maintained a friendly rivalry between the two
companies concerned.
Sales and development director Robert Hall was appointed co-ordinator
for the operation, backing explanations with a video presentation and
slide show.
At the same time all customers on McCorquodale and Horn lists were
advised by letter of what was to happen and the letter was backed by
explanatory brochures.
''Obviously there have been some expressions of regret that two very
old and very respected names are going,'' said managing director Bill
Sinclair. ''But for a long time our customers have been well aware that
we were already part of the Bowater group.''
''Already, particularly from some of our largest customers, there has
been a strong and genuine welcome for the new Rexam name for the group.
Of course, past names may linger in the memory. But we don't think it
will be very long before our new name of Rexam Cartons and Print
Scotland Limited and our unchanged high quality and service will be an
automatically recognised part of our customers' day-to-day routine.''

NORTH Sea oil production, which fell sharply in June, bounced back
strongly last month, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The bank's latest oil and gas index shows that oil output jumped by
30% in July to more than 2,500,000 barrels a day as planned maintenance
shutdowns came to an end.
Output, which was 6.5% higher than in July of last year, increased by
nearly 600,000 barrels a day and was over 140,000 barrels higher than in
May.
But it has still to recover to the record-breaking levels attained
between September of last year and April of this year. Output is
expected to have risen further this month.
This augurs well for national output figures. Lower oil output was a
factor in holding down growth in total gross domestic product to 0.5% in
the second quarter, compared with 0.7% in the first.
Gas output continued its seasonal slide in July and was 17% lower than
in June. However, the underlying trend was positive with output 5%
higher than a year ago.
The oil and gas index rose by more than 16% last month and was 6%
higher than in July of last year.
The surge in oil output boosted average daily oil and gas revenues by
9% to an estimated #32.6m. Oil revenues rose by 19.3% to a daily average
of #25.3m.
Brent crude averaged $15.83 a barrel last month, its lowest monthly
average this year. In June the average price was $17.29 after peaking at
$18.62 in April.
Mark Shea, the Royal Bank's energy economist, said: ''North Sea oil
output bounced back strongly in July, helping to offset the low price of
crude.''

Osaka, Wednesday -- Japan's financial system suffered a double blow
today when panicking depositors scrambled to pull their savings out of
the country's biggest credit union and a major regional bank collapsed.
It was the first Japanese bank collapse since the Second World War and
the trouble in the banking industry sent a shiver through financial
markets, pushing the dollar higher, as officials issued statements
saying they could handle the crisis.
In one of the darkest days in Japan's post-war financial history, the
Finance Ministry announced a scheme to liquidate 83-year-old Hyogo Bank
and fights broke out when depositors pulled money from credit union Kizu
Shinyo Kumiai.
Osaka's prefectural government ordered a partial suspension of Kizu
credit union, the largest of 400 such institutions that take deposits
from and lend money to corporate and individual members.
Banking analysts said Hyogo, a regional bank swamped by bad loans, was
Japan's first commercial bank to fold since the chaos at the end of the
Second World War.
Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura announced the establishment of a
new bank which will take over the business of Hyogo, based in
earthquake-devastated Kobe, and dispose of its debts over the next 10
years.
Earlier in the day, scuffles broke out as depositors rushed to
withdraw savings from the 27 branches of Osaka-based Kizu, which had
unrecoverable loans totalling around 600 billion yen at the end of July.
''There is absolutely no need for concern that the problems will
spread to other financial institutions and increase worries over the
credibility (of Japan's financial system),'' Bank of Japan (BoJ)
Governor Yasuo Matsushita told a news conference.
Takemura also played the down the risk of future collapses. ''I don't
think there will be any more major press conferences like today's where
a scheme to liquidate a big individual financial institution is
announced,'' he said.
He was speaking at a news conference where he said his Ministry and
the BoJ would protect Kizu and Hyogo depositors.
At Kizu branches, hundreds of people brandished deposit books and
swarmed round service counters and witnesses reported that one man was
taken to hospital after a fight.
Some walked away with fat wads of 10,000 yen notes. Others were given
notes promising payment tomorrow. The Jiji News Agency quoted Kizu
officials as saying that about 100 billion yen was withdrawn before the
credit union shut for the day.
''The inside of the main branch was almost in panic,'' said Sonoko
Nakemura, a housewife in her fifties, who had queued for an hour. ''I
barely managed to get my note.''
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said his priority was to maintain
public faith in financial institutions. ''More than anything else, it is
important to protect depositors and maintain order and public trust in
financial institutions,'' he said.
Hyogo and Kizu fell victim to the temptation to lend money to
property-related businesses during the so-called ''bubble economy'' of
inflated stock and assets prices in the late 1980s.
When the bubble burst in the early 1990s, credit unions like Kizu were
saddled with unredeemable loans and banks like Hyogo were unable to cope
with problem loans at affiliated non-bank lending institutions.
Kizu's partial suspension came just two months after that of another
credit union, Tokyo-based Cosmo Shinyo Kumiai, after a run on deposits
there.
The news jolted financial markets, sparking dollar-buying that took
the US currency abover 99 yen in early European trade. The bond market
saw the failure as a possible cue for credit easing and Japanese
government bond futures firmed.
Stockbrokers said the suspension had largely been expected and shares
were little affected. -- Reuter.

THE Bundesbank has let its key money-market repo rate fall from 4.39%
last week to 4.30% yesterday. Lower money market rates had been expected
after the German central bank cut its key discount and Lombard rates
after its council meeting on Thursday.
A similar fall in the repo rate last week alerted Bundesbank watchers
to the possibility of lower official rates which were duly delivered the
following day.
The discount rate was cut by 0.5% to 3.5% and the Lombard rate by the
same amount to 5.5%. The main reason for the rate reductions, which were
the first since March 31, was sluggish growth in the money supply.
The German economy has been slowing down, in part because of the
strength of the mark on foreign exchange markets.
It is not yet clear whether German interest rates have bottomed out.
Future monetary policy will be determined by money supply and inflation
data.
At this stage this week's fall in the repo rate has no significance
outside Germany.

SCOTTISHPOWER has extended its hostile #1000m bid for Manweb until
September 15 after buying or receiving acceptances for 19.9% of Manweb's
shares.
The Glasgow-based company said it had bought a 14.9% stake in Manweb
on the open market and had received shareholder acceptances for a
further 5.0% by the time its initial offer expired on Tuesday.
''This is the highest first offer acceptance rate in a hostile
takeover bid in Britain for the last five years,'' a ScottishPower
spokesman said.
He noted that Trafalgar House had received acceptances from 4.8% of
Northern Electric shareholders at the same stage of its failed bid for
that company in January.
More recently, the US Southern Company only managed to cajole
acceptances from 1.1% of South Western Electricity (Sweb) shareholders
before raising its offer price and securing the support of Sweb's board.
Manweb continued urging its 118,000 shareholders to reject
ScottishPower's bid and expressed satisfaction that fewer than 15,000
had so far accepted it.
''I am heartened that ScottishPower has registered such a low level of
acceptances for its offer,'' said Manweb chairman Bill Goodall. ''This
supports the board's view that its offer fundamentally undervalues
Manweb.''
But ScottishPower chief executive Ian Robinson said his company's
#1000m offer for Manweb represented ''full value for a small high-cost
REC (regional electricity company) which on its own has limited
potential''.
ScottishPower shares gained 4p yesterday, raising the value of its
shares-plus-cash offer to 980p per share. There is a cash-only
alternative of 915p.
Manweb shares fell 10p to 878p.
Andrew Wright, an electricity analyst with broker Smith New Court, saw
''virtually no significance'' in the 5% acceptance rate achieved by
ScottishPower so far.
''You wouldn't expect many people to make a decision yet until they
have seen Manweb's defence and a decision by the DTI,'' he said.
The Department of Trade and Industry is expected to say soon whether
or not it will refer the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
An announcement could come as early as tomorrow when Ian Lang, the
President of the Board of Trade, has to pronounce on the Southern bid
for Sweb.
The Southern bid was formally notified to the Government before it was
launched, so Mr Lang is legally obliged to say whether or not he is
referring it to the MMC within a period of 45 working days that expires
on Friday.
He may seize the opportunity to rule on ScottishPower's bid for Manweb
and the Hanson Group's bid for Eastern Electric at the same time.
The Government is not legally required to say whether or not it will
refer these two bids to the MMC by any fixed deadline. But it is being
urged to establish guidelines quickly for other bids that are expected
soon in the electricity sector.
The industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, submitted his
views on the ScottishPower bid to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) last
week and the latter delivered its advice to Mr Lang on Tuesday.
Manweb has until September 15 to spell out its defence strategy
against the ScottishPower bid. But the Chester-based company, which
distributes electricity in Merseyside and North Wales, is holding fire
until the Government spells out its position on MMC referral.
Manweb has so far only told shareholders that its defence package will
include unspecified cash payments and the company's holding in the
National Grid.
ScottishPower has the advantage of being able to fire the final shot
in the takeover battle since it can extend its takeover bid and even
improve its terms up to a final deadline of October 6.
Referral to the MMC would delay the outcome of the bid for at least
three months and might lead to special conditions being attached for it
to go ahead, even if it were approved in principle.
Professor Littlechild's Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer) is
understood to be seeking safeguards against too much concentration of
ownership in the electricity supply industry, where there are currently
15 companies with regional distribution franchises.
Offer is also believed to be demanding measures to prevent an
electricity generating company such as ScottishPower selling power to a
distribution only subsidiary at prices out of line with those of the UK
pool.
However, there will be a political outcry if the Government allows
foreign power companies such as Southern to buy UK electricity firms
while preventing domestic rivals like ScottishPower from doing the same.

EDINBURGH-based newspaper group Johnston Press is unlikely to bid for
Scotsman Publications and Aberdeen Journals, its executive chairman Fred
Johnston said yesterday.
Speaking after his company announced a 21.8% increase in interim
pre-tax profits to a record #8.12m, Mr Johnston said: ''We are unlikely
to be making an offer at this stage.
''I think these companies have been very well run in the past, with
high profit levels. Under our ownership, it would be hard to see where
immediate additional profitability could come from.''
Connecticut-based Thomson Corporation, which has sold its English
regional newspaper chain to Trinity, is seeking indicative offers for
its two Scottish companies, which publish The Scotsman and the Press &amp;
Journal, by today.
Meanwhile, Johnston Press has asked to see the books of Anglo-Dutch
publishing giant Reed Elsevier's Regional Newspapers operation, which
was put up for sale last month.
The company, now in a strong position to expand after digesting last
year's highly-successful #29.4m acquisition of Halifax Courier Holdings,
believes other newspaper publishing operations may come on the market
before long.
Given what has happened elsewhere in the industry, this could be a
reference to Pearson's Westminster Press division.
Johnston Press does not appear to be looking to add a Scottish daily
title to its portfolio.
The company currently has only one daily title in its 81-strong
portfolio of paid-for and free newspapers, the Halifax Evening Courier.
Mr Johnston said: ''Neither The Herald nor The Scotsman are the types
of newspapers -- because I regard both of them as quasi-national
newspapers -- in which we have developed our expertise and established a
record of success.''
Johnston Press, which raised its half-time dividend by 9.1% to 0.75p,
increased profits in the face of soaring newsprint costs and a small
reduction in advertising volumes at the majority of its publishing
centres.
Reed's Regional Newspapers, the biggest free-sheet publisher in
Britain, comprises four daily and 90 weekly newspapers.
Mr Johnston believes the titles can be divided into the three distinct
geographical areas of London and Essex, the West Midlands, and Yorkshire
and Lancashire.
He said the company was taking an intelligent interest in the sale and
added: ''Clearly the North of England, the Lancashire/Yorkshire area, is
one which has more synergy with our existing operations.''
Regional Newspapers' titles in the North of England include the Bolton
Evening News and Lancashire Evening Telegraph, as well as what Mr
Johnston considers a number of ''good'' paid-for weeklies, and some free
newspapers.
However, the figures for the Regional Newspapers operation have yet to
be released and Mr Johnston stressed that it would be wrong to assume
the company was absolutely committed to any particular course of action.
Mr Johnston attributed the record performance to ''good housekeeping''
and the strong market positions of the group's titles.
Measures to reduce newsprint consumption and waste reduced Johnston's
requirement for this by 5% during the six months to end-June.
Pre-exceptional profits, before a net charge of #684,000 in the latest
figures which primarily related to reorganisation at the Bury Times,
advanced 22.7% to #8.81m. Turnover was up 11.8% at #49.5m.
Shares in Johnston Press yesterday lost 2p to 159p.

ABTRUST's Latin American Investment Trust, which was launched just
before the Mexican peso crisis, suffered a 26% fall in net asset value
during its first nine months of existence.
The trust, which invests in Latin American equities, was launched with
#20m of shareholders' funds on November 4, 1994, a month before the
Mexican crisis caused stock markets to crash across the continent.
There has since been some recovery, but at the end of June the net
asset value per share still showed a fall from the launch price of 100p
to 73.62p.
The Aberdeen-based fund managers proposed a 1.0p special dividend,
which is only just covered by earnings per share of 1.12p per share.
The financial year of the trust will in future run from July 1 to June
30.

THE next time you are booked for speeding by a hidden camera on the
motorway you can blame Serco, a management contractor headed by
Linlithgow-born George Gray.
It has recently won a contract for all the roadside signalling
equipment including cameras for Scottish trunk roads and motorways.
Other work in Scotland includes managing various artillery ranges for
the Ministry of Defence.
The distinguishing feature of Serco's work is the wide variety of
contracts it handles. These range from running Hyde Park in London to
handling water and sewerage facilities in Perth, Australia, and managing
Bermuda airport. The factor common to all its projects is an ability to
organise a management structure and make it work.
The group is ideally placed to benefit from the trend towards
contracting out by government and the private sector. This has gained
prominence in recent years, but is not a new phenomenon. Back in the
1960s Serco cut its teeth managing the Flyingdales early warning radar
centre which demanded a high quality performance along with strict
security.
It has just won its biggest contract so far to run the National
Physical Laboratory whose main task is to maintain the weights and
measures standards against which instruments are calibrated. This will
last for five years generating revenue of #40m a year.
This compares with Serco's turnover of #150m in the first half of
1995, a rise of 25%. Profits advanced 22% to #7.4m and the interim
dividend is lifted by 16% to 1.45p.
Mr Gray, an engineer by training who worked for Pratt &amp; Whitney and
RCA in the US before joining Serco, believes the first-half trend will
continue in the rest of the year.

INCREASED car production in Continental Europe and North America
enabled T&amp;N, the international automotive components and engineering
group, to report sharply higher interim pre-tax profits of #73.2m, an
increase of 20%.
Profits would have been 33% higher were it not for asbestos-related
costs and financing costs associated with the acquisition of options in
Kolbenschmidt, the leading German piston manufacturer.
However, shareholders receive a much reduced dividend of 3.0p compared
with 7.5p previously. Unlike last year there is no enhanced scrip
alternative. The company announced in April that it would cut the
pay-out to offset the impact of last year's #100m provision to cover
asbestos claims in the US.
A further #25m was set aside in the first six months of this year, in
line with projections made at the end of 1994. Asbestos problems will
continue to leach the group of cash, up to #50m in each of the next two
years although thereafter a progressive decline in the cost of asbestos
claims is expected.
Executive chairman Colin Hope yesterday described the overall
performance as ''very satisfactory'' with both volumes and margins
improving. Margins in all three divisions grew to in excess of 10%. The
overall group margin was 11% and Mr Hope said further margin improvement
towards the group's 12.5% target should be achieved at the peak of the
cycle.
There was strong growth in the French and German markets and a good
recovery in Italy. The UK performance continued to be impressive with
exports up 21%.
The group's balance sheet was adversely affected by increased working
capital as certain stocks such as steel were built up to secure supplies
during raw material shortages earlier in the year. It is hoped that
working capital will reduce to a more comfortable level in the second
half.
Borrowings increased but interest cover is a healthy five times. T&amp;N
remains confident that it will be able to release #100m from the sale of
non-core businesses during the next two years. This together with the
improved working capital and organic cash generation should see as much
as 20% cut from the interim 78% gearing level. That still leaves gearing
too high but further improvements are expected in 1996.
Although the company saw some softening in demand in May and June for
new automotive components and continued weakness in the US aftermarket,
it is confident that further progress will be made in the second half.
Its wide geographic and product spread should enable it to withstand any
mild downturn in any one particular market.
In addition, T&amp;N is increasingly benefiting from the trend among
companies towards out-sourcing their component manufacture to get the
most up to date technology.
T&amp;N shares are unlikely to command a premium in view of its ongoing
asbestos liabilities but the underlying performance of the business is
impressive. However, they dropped 6[1/2]p to 187[1/2]p.

DESPITE intense competition in UK food retailing, cash-and-carry group
Nurdin &amp; Peacock, which serves the independent retail sector, managed to
improve sales and trading profits in the 26 weeks to June 30. It was
helped by initiatives taken last year including the introduction of
delivery services. Sales in continuing operations rose by 15% to #780m
with like-for-like sales, excluding inflation and increased selling
space, up 5.1%. This compares well with the major supermarket groups.
Profit excluding tax and interest payments grew by almost 10% to #9.5m.
The interim dividend is raised by 5% to 2.27p per share reflecting the
board's confidence. Richard Fulford, chairman of Nurdin &amp; Peacock, said
he was confident further progress would take place in the second half.
The balance sheet was strengthened by a significant reduction in
working capital and the proceeds from the sale of Cargo Club. Net
borrowings at December 30 of #116m were converted into cash and deposits
of #36m at the half-year-end.
Going forward, operating efficiencies will be enhanced by the
introduction of electronic scanning systems at the point of sale. The
integration of the M6 branches acquired last May is proceeding and
action is being taken to reduce its operating costs.
Nurdin &amp; Peacock shares were priced in the market at 187p, down 3p.

ECLIPSE Blinds yesterday confirmed its continuing recovery with the
announcement of a 53% rise in interim pre-tax profits, stripping out the
impact of exceptionals and profits from discontinued operations, to
#2.05m.
Gearing had been cut from more than 2000% at the beginning of last
year to 132% by end-June and Edinburgh-based broker Bell Lawrie White is
forecasting a level of 52% by the year-end.
The refocused window blinds company, which has been rescued from the
near-death experience it suffered in its former days as the Ashley Group
by part-time executive chairman Hamish Grossart, should be back to full
health by December.
When Mr Grossart outlined his rescue plan to the City at the beginning
of last year, it was anticipated financial recovery would take three
years.
However, Eclipse was able to achieve an earlier-than-expected
settlement of litigation relating to a disastrous foray into Spanish
food retailing under the company's previous management.
An agreement to pay #1m of the #8m claim, reached last month, enabled
the company to raise #4.2m in recent weeks through a placing and open
offer.
Eclipse, based at Inchinnan near Paisley, will return to the dividend
list in its current year.
Although overall turnover fell from #21.1m to #18.4m, sales from
continuing operations were up 4%, boosted by a good first quarter.
Reflecting on the turnaround in the company's fortunes, Mr Grossart
said: ''Here was this interesting Scottish company run by some faceless
people in some fancy head office in Mayfair and losing money.
''By being sensible and prudent and applying good housekeeping
principles, we have ended up with a nice tidy company of reasonable
size, based in Scotland.''

TO PAGANS like myself the spectacle of Christians throwing dirt at
Christians is one of life's great amusements. It is even better when
John Macleod enters the fight. His skills raise theological controversy
to the status of a great spectator sport. Onward Christian soldier! His
foe is always another Christian, but he is warmly satisfied that God is
on his side.
However, when Mr Macleod takes the long view of Scottish history he
squints a little. In a real sense the Roman Catholic Church was the
church of the poeple of Scotland. We would not have survived the Wars of
Independence if we had not had its full support, even when, for a whole
generation, it was under interdict from Rome.
The Reformed Church has never become a national church. It might have
been the saving of it if it did. The greatest triumph in the history of
English foreign policy was the Scottish Reformation. The greatest
failure of the Reformed Church in Scotland was its inability to produce
a Bible in the language of the people. Had we had a Bible in the vulgar
tongue, as the English had in the Authorised Version of 1611, we might
have had a Scottish Reformed Church worth the name. If a people are
going to speak to God they must do so in their own tongue. In Scotland
far more people worship Robert Burns than worship Jesus Christ. Burns
speaks in our own tongue and, through that language, directly to our
hearts. The pale Galilean speaks English, and a Southron English at
that.
It is the very Englishness of the Reformation that makes so many of us
Lowland Scots grue with shame. Before the Reformation there was wine and
wax and theatre-going and glee; after it a dull theocracy. I was brought
up to acknowledge my ancestors, with their traditions of worship at
conventicles among the moss hags of our native Lanarkshire. I
acknowledge that tradition. Unlike Macleod I do not regard it as a
particularly valuable birthright.
The Covenanters were attempting to introduce a theocracy as wild and
tyrannical as any royalist Government. On one view Montrose and
Claverhouse were restraining the excesses of religious zealots in the
interests of central government. There is not much to choose between
being shot for challenging the divine right of kings or the divine right
of ministers, which was what the killing times of the seventeenth
century were largely about. Mind you, it might be easier to escape from
a king than a kirk, but a plague on both their houses say I.
If people like Macleod go unanswered these times may return. As one
who is familiar with the Shorter Catechism, and had it by heart before I
was six years old, I am afraid of the bigoted assumptions made by those
who profess the faith contained in it. The Westminster Confession may be
known to few people today, but the pernicious effects of that pernicious
doctrine long made a misery of the lives of ordinary people. Authority,
like drink, should only be entrusted to those who can carry it. Since
the Revolutionary Settlement of 1689 we have had a Presbyterian Ministry
whose members have carried their substantial powers with all the
excesses of those drunk on authority and a wild sort of dogma. Has Mr
Macleod forgotten the battle cry of the Presbyterian ministers, ''Jesus
. . . and no quarter . . .''?
I have already mentioned Robert Burns, and we all know how the local
minister at Tarbolton humiliated him and made him do public penance for
fornication. This intrusion of ecclesiastical law into everyday life is
a tyranny we all fear, and with just cause. Witch-hunting was an
integral part of the dogma of the Scottish Reformed Church. Those
accused by the kirk were tortured into confession and then hanged. The
last such execution took place in 1727, little more than 20 years before
the birth of Burns. The personification of evil in the shape of the
Devil is still very much part of the teaching of the Reformed Church,
and the torture of those believed to be in contact with the Prince of
Darkness was for a good part of its history integral to its worship. Is
this part of the history of his religion that John Macleod is proud of?
There is in Mr Macleod's writings a stronger taste than mere egotism
and self-exaltation. It is his sheer lack of appreciation of other
people's points of view that is distasteful. There is more than a whiff
of racism about his doctrinaire attack on the Roman Catholic Church
''controlled largely by bishops of Irish name and descent''. I thought
we had grown out of such jibes.
This is no longer a Christian country, yet the sneers, distrust, and
sheer nastiness of Christians in conflict affect us all. I do not like
Christians. They adopt a pitying superiority to ordinary people like me.
It makes me feel small, yet I find their believes absurd, and rather
dull. Christians are no better and no worse citizens than
non-Christians, or so it is said. Yet when I see one sect condemn
another I begin to wonder. We pagans have less evil to answer for than
you Christians. You are a nasty aggressive lot.
I wish John Macleod would go away and read some pagan books. He should
try David Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature. It wouldn't make him a
better Christian, but it might make him a better man.

WHEN the Theatre Workshop Youth Theatre went to collaborate with the
Canadian Mermaid Youth Theatre they took themself as the subject of
their play. Scots-Canadian, Anglo-Scottish or Scotto-Irish: the problems
of being young and working out these identities led them to create Just
Another Tartan Moose.
This chequered moose becomes a symbol of cultural miscegenation. In
this case a mongrel cross-breed of North American and North British
kitsch but intended to represent the Moulinex blender of all cultures.
Fighting to preserve the purity of national ingredients against the
multi-cultural soup are the fascistic Culture Police.
In this humorous multimedia performance the two young companies lock
transatlantic antlers to protest against all purest patriotisms.

TEATR Provisorium here reprises a production it previously performed
in Edinburgh, a fusion of devised work, fragments of Homer's Odyssey and
texts from an array of authors including Samuel Beckett, Cyprian K
Norwid and Shakespeare. Through an artful sequence of highly detailed
scenes of the lives of two homeless men, it explores universal themes,
pinpointing poignant moments when compassion, a fragile flickering
candle, bravely flares in the face of a cold, unloving and unlovely
existence.
The men, a wandering actor Jacek Brzezinski and a solitary singer
Slawek Skopkena, ride on to the stage on comical bicycle carts which
house velvet-draped mini stages. A double-bass is strapped to
Brzezinski's cart, which he plucks with mordant gloom. Punctuated with
affecting moments, the piece is executed with a weary languor which robs
it of its potential to penetrate and makes it seem jaded and tired.

THE representatives of Bosnia's Serbs are repulsive and strange.
Having thrived on fantasy, like rot on a carcass, they can no longer
afford to recognise the truth. Delusion is their life; without it, they
are nothing; without it, the hallucination of Greater Serbia, ethnically
pure, Christian, and somehow redeemed after centuries of combat and
paranoia, is so much dust.
It was always a frangible thing. All nationalism lays claim to history
but the Serbian case is so tortuous, such a tangle of half-truths, blood
myths, and real suffering as to seem, even in this abattoir of a
century, like an atavism, less politics than vendetta, less ideology
than folk memory. History, in this tale of the tribe, is an insult to be
erased.
It may be that this is the great irony of the conflict. Sarajevo is
besieged but it is the Serbs who are prisoners, even if the trap is
psychological. They are said to be as weary of fighting as everyone
else, but what would peace, the compromise of an unresolved conflict,
say about them and everything they have done? They are addicted to
self-deceit. How to cure them? Perhaps it can't be done. The great risk
involved in Nato bombardments is precisely that they will become the
kind of negotiations the Serbs understand. They shell, talk a little
peace, and shell again. They agree a truce, break a truce -- and shell
again. In Serbian politics atrocities are held to concentrate the
Western mind and bargaining is only ever conducted from positions of
strength.
Thus it is that Nato's attacks are presented by the Serbs, for whom an
enemy is born every minute, as a plot. They claim the Bosnian government
murdered its own people in Sarajevo with the connivance of the West
simply to give the alliance an excuse to enter the war on Bosnia's side.
They even affect to believe the fantasy. So lies spin into madness.
But for that reason, if no other, the strategy Nato now adopts cannot
be allowed to resemble something the Serbs understand. If this is a
defining moment, as the UN claims, then the only useful thing it can
define is a real effort to enforce a peace once and for all while
bringing Bosnia's Serbs to what remains of their senses. Otherwise the
bloody gavotte goes on.
In any case, the aim is not to impose a wholly just solution -- the
restoration of pre-existing borders -- but simply to achieve the
compromise embodied in last year's Contact Group plan. This already
awards the Serbs 49% of Bosnia and does not pretend to settle all
claims. Only two things can be said for it: it does not require that the
bizarre Pale government should accept total defeat and it is, according
to the West, the best anyone can hope for.
It may be, of course, that the Bosnian Serbs are more vulnerable than
their apologists have led us to believe. Those who once warned us of a
European Vietnam are left to explain how the Croats rolled over the
Serbs of Krajina. Even if a deal was done -- and nothing is proven -- it
hardly points to an invincible force incapable of contemplating
surrender.
Nevertheless, it is hard to believe the army of Ratko Mladic, the war
criminal who likes to describe the shelling of civilians as ''shooting
the beef'', will simply fold up their tents and steal away. Nothing in
their record suggests it. If past experience is anything to go by they
will attempt to use negotiations as a delaying tactic until conditions
for another offensive are more propitious. In other words, the only
peace they will accept is the one that comes with victory. The world
knows what that means for those they hope to conquer.
After 41 months of bloodshed, Nato and the UN have reached only one of
the conclusions which were obvious from the start. This is the simple
fact that appeasement, rather than bringing peace, simply made matters
worse. Sooner or later, force had to be met with force if UN resolutions
were to mean anything, now or ever again.
But the risk remains that diplomats, being what they are, will imagine
they can hold peace talks before Nato finishes what it has begun.
Some have already said so, fearing aloud that the US-led peace
initiative will be ''undermined'' by air strikes. Yet that, inevitably,
will be the Serbs' first demand: halt the attacks or we will refuse to
negotiate. After the West's bombardments, there can be only one logical
answer: in the matter of the safe areas there is no more room for
negotiation.
Thus far that is the line being taken, but it awaits a coherent
Serbian response. The chances are they will attempt to wheedle another
round of talks, to promise what they do not mean to deliver, and to buy
time with the lies which are their tested weapons. Having shown its
military strength, the West will have wasted its efforts if it fails to
call every bluff offered.
All of which is to say that talks cannot begin until everyone
understands what is to be said. Some of the Serbs, their sense of
reality under siege, will interpret such a condition as a demand for
surrender.
Perhaps it is. But given that in pre-war Bosnia they accounted for 33%
of the population, at present occupy 70% of the land, and are being
offered 49%, their claim on anyone's sympathy is no greater than it ever
was.
The delusion must end. The belief that internationally recognised
borders can be overturned in the name of God and blood, that
humanitarian aid can be seized as a bargaining chip, that mass murder
and mass rape are diplomacy by other means, must be purged finally. The
Serbs too deserve their sanity.

YET another upheaval is under way in American television. Time-Warner,
the country's largest publisher, has made a $8000m bid for Turner
Broadcasting, the company that owns CNN.
Time already owns 18% of Turner. John Malone's TeleCommunications Inc
owns another 21%, and The Wall Street Journal reports today that Mr
Malone and Ted Turner himself both approve the deal, so on the face of
it the odds are strong that it will go through.
The possible snags are that either man might change his mind. It is
also possible that some other company might make a better offer for
Turner, one that might tempt Mr Malone and might even distract
Time-Warner. The two obvious candidates are Rupert Murdoch's News Corp
and General Electric, which owns NBC.
Ted Turner inherited a small outdoor advertising company in Atlanta
from his father, who committed suicide, and built it into a ''Super
Station'' (his term). He attained personal celebrity by winning the
America's Cup and marrying Jane Fonda.
He launched CNN as the world's first all-news cable channel, and it
became compulsive viewing all over the world, particularly in times of
crisis such as the Gulf War in 1991.
Turner Broadcasting owns several other cable channels. Time-Warner was
formed by a merger between Time-Life Inc, which publishes magazines
including Time, books and videos, and the Warner Brothers movie studio.
It is the country's leading music publisher and puts out a number of
cable channels, some of them in partnership with Mr Malone's TCI. If it
swallows Turner, it will surpass the recent merger between Disney and
ABC television to become the biggest media company in the world.
Turner is said to own the largest film library in the world, while
Warner owns the second biggest.
The other big TV deal announced recently was the proposed sale of CBS
to Westinghouse, the electrical company that also owns a major radio
network. Mr Turner has wanted to buy CBS for years and has perhaps
decided to sell out to Time-Warner after losing it.
The latest major TV deal was proposed after secret meetings between Mr
Turner and the head of Time-Warner, Gerald Levin. Mr Levin flew with his
wife to Montana on August 19, where Mr Turner has a ranch. They were met
at the airport by Jane Fonda, who drove them to the ranch house.
The boards of the two companies have been informed of the provisional
agreement. Now the details have to be worked out. The Journal observes
that many big media deals have fallen through when the exact terms had
to be settled. It is proposed that Mr Turner would become Mr Levin's
deputy.

serpents (August 29), and recall sitting in my favourite Arran pub
enjoying a quiet drink with my brother. During the evening we chatted to
another holidaymaker as follows:
''What does your father work at?'' ''He's retired.'' ''What did he do
when he was working?'' ''He was a minister.''
Then the conversation ended, our companion leaving our company
abruptly, never to speak to us again.
The standards by which clergy and their families are expected to live,
and others' perceptions of them, must make them among the loneliest
people in society. They are never off duty, even in their own homes, and
forming normal relationships is difficult because of ''the cloth''.
It is little wonder that some clergy, as in any profession, fall from
grace.
It is not the clergy who need a code of behaviour but rather the whole
of society. Perhaps the Ten Commandments would be useful?

I UNDERSTAND that following, the recent VJ-Day -- End of World War II
sermon which I preached in St Giles', Edinburgh on Sunday, August 20,
upset was caused to veterans of the ''forgotten war'' in the Far East.
I apologise sincerely to any who may have been upset -- certainly no
insult was intended to any veterans. But I would like to give some
background to my sermon.
When asked to preach at St Giles' I regarded this as a particular
honour, which it was. The official invitation card, from the Secretary
of State for Scotland, indicated that I was being invited to ''a service
of remembrance and commitment to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of
the Second World War''.
Consequently I believed that I was to speak, not only about VJ Day,
but also about the end of the Second World War in general. In fact,
about one quarter of my sermon was devoted to speaking of the evils
perpetrated against our forces by the Japanese: ''We focus, with regard
to the war in the Far East, on the living victims almost more than on
the dead, as the living seem to us to be symbols of how the human spirit
can never be broken''.
The service was one of remembrance and commitment. Consequently, as
well as remembering the dreadful deeds of 50 years ago perpetrated by
both sides in the conflict, I believed that it was incumbent on me to
speak also of our ongoing commitment to peace.
I was, of course, given no directives as to the line I should take in
my sermon by the Secretary of State for Scotland, the host on this
occasion.
Thus I followed my conscience, keeping in mind my basic belief from
the Ten Commandments: ''Thou shalt not kill''; and, what I see as its
extension: ''Thou shalt not threaten to kill, particularly with a
nuclear device'', keeping in mind the teachings of all the Churches with
regard to nuclear war.
The task of a preacher is never easy. St Paul reminds his disciple,
Timothy, to ''proclaim the message, welcome or unwelcome . . . refute
falsehood, correct error, call to obedience''.
And he further states in his letter to the Thessalonians: ''We have
not taken to preaching because we are deluded or immoral or trying to
deceive anyone; it was God who decided that we were fit to be entrusted
with the good news and when we are speaking we are not trying to please
men but God, who can read our inmost thoughts''.
As preacher, it is not my role to try to please anyone but to preach
the truth as I see it. I renew my appreciation of the valiant veterans
of the Second World War for all their efforts and my horror at the
thought of the suffering they endured.
As I indicated in my sermon: ''Those of us who did not suffer cannot
ignore or forget the cry of those whose memories are indelibly filled
with thoughts of horrors and evils which they can never forget''.

HE has it all: personal history, quirky family, past loves, and the
weather. This is stand-up comedy in stanza form.
Returning to a partnership formed at the Fringe in 1965, Roberts plays
his original guitar settings for McGough's sixties love sequence, and
provides backing lyrics for a new Chinese sequence. It is a combination
which works well.
But the hallmark of McGough's work and its beauty lies in its self
deprecation. McGough rejects the gimmicks of performance poetry. His
delivery is poker-face, his subject matter apparently so bare. But there
between those dry, everyday words, of spitting notices and Aunty Marge,
and poetry in education, there sparks McGough's own peculiar lyricism.
Poetry has descended from on high and found its everyman voice.

THE British Roads Federation report contains a number of glaring
inaccuracies (August 24). For example, it is stated that the start date
for the Lhanbryde by-pass on the A96 in Grampian has slipped back since
1993. It was in fact completed several weeks ago.
Such inaccuracy undermines the credibility of those local groups such
as my own who are actively campaigning for a much needed by-pass.

George Hume examines Scottish Office concern that the country's water
resources remain an unknown quantity
A GOVERNMENT report has revealed that Scottish local authorities are
unable to guarantee a reliable supply of water and have no means of
assessing drought risk. An investigation by the Scottish Office
discloses that no common system exists to enable a realistic and
consistent assessment of water yield across the country.
Now officials of the Environment Department of the Scottish Office are
demanding action and an urgent study is being carried out at Heriot-Watt
University to enable local authorities to determine exactly how much
water they can guarantee to supply and assess future need.
According to Professor Paul Jowitt of Heriot-Watt, overseeing the
study: ''There is no consistent system in Scotland. It is expensive to
assess risk and there has not been a perceived need.''
The disclosure of local government's failure to provide essential
information on just how much water can be delivered comes as the new
Scottish water authorities prepare to take control, warning of
substantial rises in water bills.
West of Scotland households face increased water bills of 15% next
year and a further 25% on average the following year. In the East the
new water authority is planning to fund a #300m spending gap for new
projects through private finance and increased charges.
According to Professor Jowitt, little historic data on yield and
demand exists on Scottish reservoirs and any system developed at
Heriot-Watt would almost certainly have to be extrapolated country-wide
from a narrow base.
The failure of Scottish local authorities to know what water they can
deliver, and when to impose restrictions on use in times of drought so
that an adequate supply can be maintained, is revealed in the Government
report Public Water Supplies in Scotland.
It makes clear that local government control of water in Scotland has
failed to address the fundamental issue of knowing how much water can be
gathered, how much is likely to be used, and how much can be delivered.
Although pipe leakage in Scotland is thought to be as high as that of
the privatised water companies south of the Border -- about 30% in all
from reservoirs, streams and boreholes -- reliable figures on water
yield, essential for investment decisions by the new water authorities,
just do not exist.
The report discloses that in the past it had been assumed that the
yields quoted in the Environment Department's annual survey were the
legal maximum allowed the local authorities and that these, in turn,
were based on hydrological assessments.
During an investigation, however, it became unclear what the reported
yields were based on. In order to clarify the issue, a list of the top
90 sources in Scotland in terms of their ''yield'' was issued to the
local authorities to comment on the basis of the figures quoted.
It was the local authorities' response to that document that alarmed
the Scottish Office. The report says: ''Many authorities quoted the
yield as being the 'hydrological yield', net of compensation flows, but
have given no indication as to the reliability of that yield.
''Indeed, in undertaking studies to determine the yield, current and
potential, of some or all of the sources under their control, some
authorities have been unable to provide the data necessary for
evaluation of total available yield.
''The remaining authorities did not provide any information on the
derivation of the figures they are using for the yield of their
sources.''
A computer system to monitor reservoir yield and assess demand has
been developed by Professor Jowitt for North West Water Ltd, which
serves about 7,000,000 customers.
Based on details collected at one reservoir in the company's area over
a period of 70 years -- and adapted to take in the other 80-plus water
sources in use by North West Water -- it gives an at-a-glance overview
of the total water picture, making it instantly clear where average
water levels should be at any given time of year, showing where they
currently stand, and what the position is likely to be in the months
ahead in the light of these figures.
Professor Jowitt says: ''Local authorities in Scotland cannot quantify
the level of risk (of drought) and we are looking now for a consistent
methodology to establish yield. A great deal of detail is needed and
there is not much available.''
The Scottish Office report on its assessment of demands and resources
remarks, with some irony in the light of its discoveries: ''Scotland has
always been thought of as a land of plenty with respect to its water
resources.
''Indeed, a quick calculation using long-term rainfall statistics of
the total resource available would tend to indicate that in an average
year the overall resource outstrips the demand for supply a hundredfold
. . . however, such an over-simplistic calculation does not give the
whole picture.''

YOUR recent report on the British Road Federation by-pass survey
suggested that some 41 schemes are planned to relieve some of Scotland's
small towns and villages (August 24). The true figure is somewhat
greater.
For instance, a number of long-standing trunk road schemes in
Strathclyde were omitted, such as the A77 Maybole by-pass and the A78
Ardrossan-Saltcoats-Stevenston by-pass. Other schemes, such as the A737
Dalry by-pass (all originally proposed in 1953), which would have been
undertaken by the regional council, were deleted from transport plans in
1993. There may be more cases like this.
Additionally, now that the Scottish Office has named new trunk roads,
of which the A737 is one, they must consider the implications. Will
they, like Strathclyde have had to, delay important by-passes for yet
more years?
Even if their answer is to spend more on public transport or traffic
calming, the problem of roadspace in small towns remains. You cannot
have bus lanes in narrow streets, or off-street parking when the houses
are right beside narrow pavements.
As so many small towns are being strangled by through traffic, the
answer in most cases is a by-pass. People have more space to walk
around, public transport has more space, it is safer to cross the road,
and easier to get on with life.

I WAS surprised that the article by James McKillop and Keith Sinclair

''offers the most authoritative account of the life of the greatest hero

With all due respect to Dr Tranter's book, it is a novel and as such
cannot be compared with such factual accounts as Andrew Fisher's William
Wallace (1986); D J Gray's William Wallace, the King's Enemy (1991); nor
indeed my own biography William Wallace, Brave Heart, published in April
by Mainstream, which you reviewed recently.

ONE cannot but admire the way that the self-appointees in the
so-called Constitutional Convention inexorably pursue their underlying
prime directive -- that, despite the occasional spat, they all
wholeheartedly endorse the notion that ''poor'' Scotland is limited to a
choice of block grant from Westminster or a top-up from Westminster.
They are delighted when asked to defend the begging-bowl format
crafted by Joel Barnett, the last Labour Treasury Chief Secretary.
They are delighted not because it is an equitable formula, rather
because it allows them to perform their historic role as Scotland's
political neuters, to peddle once again the fiction that statehood for
Scotland is not financially credible.
When this fiction is eventually exposed, they will lose all political
meaning.

THE PROLONGED spell of hot weather appears to have ended. This is
probably just as well because hot weather and the British people do not
seem to co-exist satisfactorily. It seems as soon as the sun shines for
more than a week we face a drought, despite the fact that we are an
island and supposedly have a world-competitive water industry.
To cope with the water shortage one of the privatised companies,
Yorkshire Water, has suggested that local businesses curb production,
extend staff holidays, or even move production outside certain areas.
This from a company which made a pre-tax profit of #142m last year,
despite losing 103 million gallons of water through leaks every day.
Although there is a general reluctance to embrace the European Social
Chapter, one custom which arguably would do much to restore the
collective national good humour and probably assist economic growth in
the process would be the adoption of an afternoon siesta. I am sure a
couple of hours' snooze would do the world of good for many people,
myself included.
Just think how much better a refreshed mind would be able to tackle
the workload. Such a nap would also enable the body to cool down and
hopefully with it some short tempers. Before I left to go to Tuscany on
holiday a fortnight ago the news was full of tales of road rage, with
some motorists resorting to physical violence for a number of what
appeared to me to be minor irritants. There was even one incidence
highlighted of trolley rage, with tempers flaring at a supermarket
checkout queue. All this rage cannot be good for a nation.
Although Italy was cooler than much of the UK, it was still hot. Its
summers are traditionally much hotter than in the UK but we saw no
evidence of any sort of rage, despite the fact that we might have given
cause for annoyance. I am sure that driving on the wrong side of the
road into the headlights of an oncoming car would be deemed suitable
grounds for road rage anywhere, but not a bit of it in Italy.
Our one experience of a supermarket was also aggro-free. Seeking
provisions for by the pool we ventured in search of a grocers. We could
not find one, but what we did come across was a Co-Op, not the familiar
blue and white Co-Op of the UK. Although aside from the corporate
colours it could have been the UK's Co-Op, no gleaming temple of
pre-packed groceries and ready meals here. Despite wandering aimlessly
up the aisles, along with the other Brits, in the opposite direction to
everyone else there were no raised voices.
Another way in which the continentals lead the way forward is in
summer dressing for work. Smart casual is the order of the day. No
steaming woollen suits and socks for the Italians and French in high
summer.
There seems to be the idea here in the UK that brains are somehow
associated with wearing a woollen suit and that it is impossible to be
taken seriously in business if you are not wearing one. The adoption of
more casual and comfortable clothing does not mean beachwear for the
office.
A large number of retailers in all price brackets have smart ranges of
more casual clothes such as linen suits which would be ideal.
There is probably a greater chance of the UK adopting
continental-style dress codes for the summer than a siesta. This is
partly because of the North American trend towards ''dress down'' days
on Fridays. Several American employers in the UK have introduced a
similar dress code, although client meetings, quite rightly, still
remain a cause for donning a suit.
Increased levels of self-employment and home working are enabling
greater numbers of people to have a more flexible, relaxed approach to
work which does not necessarily mean it is less productive labour.
Indeed during the hot weather, working early in the morning and in the
evenings when it is cooler would make far more sense.
A leisurely lunch followed perhaps by a couple of hours' snooze sounds
like an ideal recipe for summer working in the 1990s, at least for those
able to structure their working life in such a way. The technological
revolution is such that in the not too distant future many more of us
will be able to work in such a way.

In the feature, Who pays the piper (August 24), Alf Young makes a
wildly inaccurate point about Scotland's public sector finances.
He says that ''if a devolved Edinburgh parliament did raise all its
own taxes . . . total revenues would fall well short of the money which
currently passes annually to the Scottish Office in what is known as the
Scottish Block''.
Since the Scottish Office budget is some #15 billion, and total
revenue raised in Scotland this year is #27 billion, then the point is
patent nonsense.
Current Scottish Office spending could easily be covered by assigning
Scottish revenues, if there was the political will to do so. As well as
income tax and VAT, other taxes such as North Sea revenues, National
Insurance contributions, corporation tax, and excise duties could be
assigned -- if there was a genuine desire to give an assembly economic
teeth.
By ditching assigned revenues New Labour have shown that they have no
such desire. Labour's ''powerhouse parliament'' would be nothing more
than a Westminster poodle. After six years in the making, the Convention
scheme is concluding in financial farce.

LIKE many another impecunious Glaswegian student 35 years ago, I first
took advantage of the then Glasgow Herald introductory reduced-price
offer and have been an eager reader during all my teaching career.
But never have I been more surprised and delighted with the paper than
on Saturday when, on turning the pages of Weekender, I was confronted
with a photograph of myself on the back of an elephant at Calderpark Zoo
in 1948 when I was all of three years old!
That picture really made my weekend and that of my octogenarian
parent, who had proudly purchased a copy of the original photograph at

Just in case you are interested, I'm the one in the middle.

YOUR editorial, Dounreay reprocessing, totally misrepresents both the
radioactive waste shaft and the issue of consultation with and by
Highland Regional Council (August 26).
To my knowledge, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority has never
concealed the existence of the shaft, which was authorised by the
Scottish Office for radioactive waste disposal from 1958 to 1977. In
1977 the gas space above the waste in the shaft exploded; this incident
was reported to the then Secretary of State for Energy and widely
reported in the press.
A review of the shaft was prepared by independent consultants to the
Scottish Office and placed in the House of Commons library. The shaft
has been regularly exposed to public discussion since 1977 and a article
in The Herald on September 21, 1993, discusses the shaft in detail.
On consultation, Dounreay briefed HRC early in 1992 on the prospects
of major international reprocessing business. Following that, UK and
overseas MTR fuel was reprocessed at Dounreay during 1993/94. I made
reference to our pursuit of more such business at an open meeting in the
HRC chamber in Inverness earlier this year.
HRC and the public will be consulted on the Dounreay radioactive
discharge authorisations as they are considered by HMIPI. This process
had already started when I took over as Dounreay director last year.
It is also quite wrong to dismiss the very substantial contribution
which Dounreay has made to the North Highlands economy over the last 40
years with the words, ''Caithness, as a whole, has suffered for years
through over-reliance on the nuclear industry, stifling the possibility
of a diversity of interest''.
Many small and medium-sized local firms have successfully traded with
Dounreay over the years, for example through the provision of goods and
contractor services. Without Dounreay, some of these firms might not
have been established.
The wages of Dounreay staff and locally based contractors are #30m
annually and will accumulate to approximately #136m over the next five
years. Most, if not all, of this money will filter through the North
Highlands economy, as it has done for the last 40 years.

IN reply to Jim Wallace it should be pointed out that under
Westminster rule Scotland has not been able to stop expenditure on
Trident (August 21).
The Scottish Liberals had a long and honourable tradition of opposing
nuclear weapons. It is a shame that, because of electoral priorities
south of the Border, this position has been abandoned.
If Scotland chooses to let Westminster exercise sovereignty on matters
such as Trident, then we have no-one to blame but ourselves if the
consequences are resources being denied to more worthwhile means of
employment.
That is the crux of the SNP's position which Jim Wallace ignores.

THE message was strikingly simple; the voice said: ''Barry Goldwater
for President''. There was then a long pause, before a little snigger
gave birth to a guffaw which built into a choking laugh and finally a
burst of helpless mirth. It was the most effective party political
broadcast I have ever seen.
A close second was the Democratic slug at George Bush where a figure
was seen tramping through the snow. As he forged ahead it was noticeable
that he left no footprints. ''This is the impact Vice-President Bush has
made on US policy in the last four years.''
But British PPBs have hovered between the wretched and the
retch-making, the pits and the pitiful. When he was Prime Minister I
wrote to Edward Heath to suggest that, in the Tory slot, he should
simply play the piano for five minutes, undoubtedly making far more
people happy than by any of his utterances.
That plea fell on stony ground, as did my idea that John MacGregor,
who was a member of the Magic Circle, should come on and make something
disappear . . . like the trade deficit or John Selwyn Gummer perhaps.
Instead, in the early eighties, I was commanded to appear on one of the
ghastly episodes where I had to say a line like: ''Labour regions ruin
your budget plans, Conservatives mean your savings soar,'' or some such
inanity.
In the first two takes I managed to promise that the nation's soarings
would save and I never watch any of these ''Alright on the Night'' progs
in case I come on. Suffice to say I was never asked to appear again.
I tried to argue -- it must have been the drink -- with Mrs Thatcher
that PPBs actually lost, rather than gained, voters but was rewarded
with the withering glance I came to know and love. So we persevered and
had Mr Major rediscovering his Brixton roots as though he had spent the
intervening years on the Moon.
If anything, the Labour efforts have been even more
intelligence-insulting -- Gordon Brown doing his Sgt Fraser impression
from Dad's Army: ''We are all doomed, doomed, I tell you,'' or cretinous
cries from out-of-work actors of ''lies, lies, all Tory lies''.
The Kinnocks strolling hand-in-hand, eye-to-eye across the cliffs was
watch-worthy only in the hope one of them might repeat the real-life
trick of falling into the sea and, anyway, the Reagans did it so much
slicker.
No Lib-Dem broadcast has ever penetrated my consciousness, while all I
can recall about the Nats' efforts is dear old Sean muttering: ''It'sh
time'', which, as it turned out, it most certainly wasn't.
But hark! The bleat on the street, the whisper up the close, the news
from the screws is that PPBs may be coming to the end of their tether,
that they could be heading for Andy-Pandyland, finding a last resting
place somewhere between Simon Dee and the Epilogue.
Apparently some smart guy in Tory Central Office -- I'll re-phrase
that, the smart guy in Tory Central Office -- commissioned reaction
following the last party broadcast. Surprise, surprise, after watching
it fewer people said they were going to support the Government than
before it went out and about eight million kettles were boiled, thus
causing even more problems for the (English) privatised water companies.
The end could be nigh.
No-one will mourn their passing and democracy will not be harmed in
the slightest. It is manifest nonsense that political parties should be
able to commandeer the air waves to shovel out whatever drivel takes
their fancy.
Prime Ministers in time of war and leaders of Opposition to reply
might possibly be justified, though even then I would like some
questioning process. There are plenty of opportunities through the media
for politicians to put over their message -- they do not always accept
them because they do not wish to face cross-examination.
When last, for instance, did you hear or see a member of HM loyal
Opposition put themselves forward, not to attack the Government, but to
produce and defend a policy of their own? When last did you see or hear
a policy of their own? In place of party political broadcasts let us
have a series of interviews with the PM, Tony Blair, Paddy Ashdown, and
even Alex Salmond -- in the Gaelic, of course -- conducted by someone we
can all respect. No, not Chick Young, I was thinking more of that other
elder stateman of the tube, Sir Robin Day, ridiculously retired from the
chair of Question Time, which has never been the same since, and
apparently doing little else with his time except growing old.
How much better to employ his talents in this new, and expanded,
official role. Equal time could be offered to all the parties and, if
their leaders were too feartie, replacements like the great bear
Heseltine or the old salt Prescott could be fielded in their place.
''Fat chance,'' chorused Messrs Major and Blair, in unison.
At the end of each interview Sir Robin would ask several questions of
the viewers who would then phone in their answers. Have you believed a
word that was said? Would you buy a second-hand Trabant from this man?
Has anyone seen Tom Clarke? Non-controversial stuff like that, but
interesting.
My campaign to end political broadcasts, which is supported by Mary
Whitehouse, Paul Gascoigne, and Michael Barrymore, to name but a few, is
worthy of your support and I invite you to send donations to me, c/o The
Governor's Palace, Bermuda, The British Empire. I shall be there for the
next two weeks, celebrating the result of the recent referendum, and
will tell all when I return.
Three cheers for Her Majesty.

THE transformation from finger-wagging to bombing was abrupt and
surprising only because so many previous Bosnian Serb outrages had gone
unpunished. This time there was a framework which enshrined the
ultimatum presented to the Bosnian Serbs after the London conference in
July. That ultimatum allowed the bombing and shelling of yesterday to be
wrapped in the gravitas of diplomatic intent, yet the politicians, from
Clinton and Claes to Portillo and Major, failed to erase the impression
that policy was still being made on the hoof. The mortar attack on
Sarajevo on Monday which killed 37 men, women, and children and wounded
a further 85 was obviously the catalyst. Yet, with the cynicism which
this particular conflict has bred over the years, it is reasonable to
ask if the retaliatory action would have taken place if only seven had
been killed, or 17. Nevertheless, we must deal with facts as we have
them and the facts tell us that Nato and the United Nations have
embarked on a policy of extraordinary risk in that they have abandoned
an even-handed approach and, in a conflict which has seen abuses by all
sides, have seen fit to attack the worst offenders.
This undoubtedly gives a feeling of satisfaction. It is clear that
Nato soldiers on the ground, and probably in the air, are pleased to be
using their skills professionally and in a relatively unhaltered manner.
Nato and UN planners exhibit similar emotions and there is a general
sense that the Bosnian Serbs asked for such treatment and deserve a good
deal more of it. This may be so, and of course the London conference
agreement makes it legitimate. If successful it will also have the
desirable effect of removing the threat of mortars and shells from
Sarajevo and the other safe areas which yesterday saw bombing of the
Bosnian Serb artillery which surrounded them. Yet anything which is done
in former Yugoslavia must be judged against the yardstick of whether it
is likely to bring a wider peace, and on this question there is less
satisfaction.
Much will depend on the reaction of the Bosnian Serbs, and on the
first evidence it appears that the mood of the Bosnian Serb leaders is
defiant. This was expected. Nato and UN officials, while gratified that
at last they were allowed to do something about the murderous attacks on
civilians in Sarajevo, are just as obviously uncertain about what will
happen next. It has been made clear that the attacks on Bosnian Serb
heavy artillery will continue until it is either destroyed or removed
from the areas which it threatens. This could be a long process and
during it the Bosnian Serb military will emerge from the shock of
yesterday's attacks. It is then likely to be even more obdurate and only
too likely to begin guerrilla-style attacks against Nato and UN forces.
There is, however, a glimmer of hope that the process which has been set
in train will trigger another one inside the notoriously riven and
unstable Bosnian Serb leadership. The hope is that determined action
against them will force changes of attitude and, ideally, of personnel
at the top and that this might lead to more conciliatory behaviour and a
better attitude towards the peace process. This is very much a long-shot
and the best that the Bosnian Government can do in the situation is to
keep quiet and enjoy the recognition that the course of action they have
urged for so long is actually happening. The risks in all this, we
repeat, are high. Yet it was something which had to be tried, not just
for the suffering people of Sarajevo and the other safe areas, but for
the shredded credibility of the international institutions and for the
wider hope of civilised behaviour in Europe.

William Russell writes that while the tabloid press hounds Michael
Barrymore over his announcement that he is homosexual, his fans remain
loyal
SO Michael Barrymore is home and dry. Gay he may be, but it has not
upset his fans as his hat trick in the National Television Awards
apparently proves. He was named best presenter, his ITV series Barrymore
was voted best family programme and Strike It Lucky the best quiz show.
As the Sun, whose readers cast some of the votes, said: ''We're right
behind you Mike (but not too close).''
There is no reason for surprise either at the result, or the vulgarity
of the Sun. Barrymore is a consummate television performer and the
British public has never had any problems accepting gay comedians, while
it is the sort of macho, tasteless, saloon-bar remark Sun headline
writers specialise in.
Many gay funnymen have been taken to the British public's heart in the
past. Frankie Howerd, Danny La Rue and Kenneth Williams, although he was
also a gifted actor, are examples, while gay pop stars are a dime a
dozen.
Barrymore may not excel at anything in particular, but like other
versatile TV performers who have preceded him, he is very good at a lot
of things. He can dance, sing, tell jokes and people relate to him. We
like him, and while we have read all the stories about his battles with
drink and his marital problems, that liking has remained. He has also
conducted himself with dignity, and Cheryl, his wife and manager, has
stood by him, which helps.
But do these awards really mean anything? The Sun boasted that
thousands of its readers voted. But according to MCM, the company which
organised the poll, only about 30,000 people voted, and they were not
all Sun readers because the voting forms were also published in Inside
Soap magazine and it was possible to cast one's vote by phone throughout
the ITV network.
Even if each vote represents a household, it is still only a fraction
of the viewing audience. It is, of course, a large sample, larger than a
poll company would take, although it is not a scientific sample, its
composition being dictated by where the requests for votes were placed.
MCM said the awards -- this is the first year they have been held --
differed from anything held before in that this was the television
public speaking, not members of a peer group.
The BAFTA awards, for example, are voted for by members of the British
Academy of Film and Television Arts who are either in the film and
television industries or journalists.
Unfortunately, how many votes were cast for the winners and runners up
in the National Television Awards is confidential, according to MCM, so
Barrymore could have won on a minority of the votes cast in each of the
three categories, depending on how many entries there were and how the
votes were apportioned. We really do not know enough.
But MCM's reticence is understandable. Disclosure might just have the
effect of devaluing the results. On the other hand, to win in three
categories was a substantial achievement and lends credence to the view
that, even if Barrymore did not win hands down, he did win comfortably.
The other thing about the awards is that the awards programme,
commissioned by Grampian, was seen by millions of viewers. If they had
been outraged by the results they would have made it known. But there
were no protests. The audience shouted things like ''Michael, we love
you'', but it was a celebrity audience which does things like that, and
the real test of popularity will come when he stands up on stage in a
summer show somewhere like Blackpool.
As for the rest of the awards, they patently reflect the taste of only
a certain section of the viewing public.
The most popular talk show was Des O'Connor Tonight; the most popular
soap -- Coronation Street; the most popular comedy performer -- Brian
Conley; the most popular comedy programme -- Men Behaving Badly; the
most popular newcomer -- Angela Griffin who plays Fiona Middleton in
Coronation Street; the most popular actress -- Anna Friel who used to
play Beth Jordache in Brookside; the most popular drama -- Soldier,
Soldier; the most popular actor -- Robson Green from Soldier Soldier,
and the top young people's programme -- Top of the Pops.
Still it would be nice to believe Barrymore's success has meant that
the tabloids, particularly the Sun, which made much of his admission he
is homosexual, have got it wrong over how the public now feel about the
love that dare not speak its name.

THE pavements in this area were resurfaced a few months ago. Then came
Cabletel which dug them up again with trenches that wander side to side
along the pavements.
Cabletel have joined the gasman, BT, electricity, water, and sewage in
running services along our streets.
But now, if we are to believe the new set of pavement markings,
another company is about to repeat the exercise. The result will be that
little of Strathclyde's resurfacing will be left and the money spent
will have been wasted.
Could we not have some co-operation and co-ordination? It should save
the ratepayers and the service providers money and the residents the
mess and hassle.
Clearly power, gas, water, and sewage need to be placed into separate
conduits with separate access manholes. However there is no such need
for communications. A little forethought indicates that one conduit with
multiple bores would provide the needs of many more communications
companies than is anticipated.
One trench and one set of manholes requires only one disturbance of
the footpath and roadway and only one expenditure on trenching.
Why don't they (the communications companies and the roads authority)
get their acts together?

IN your feature on independent school results (August 25), you record
a large number of pupils who obtained Highers in the sixth year.
However, when later this year you come to publish the results of state
schools, Highers obtained in the sixth year will not feature since the
Scottish Office only takes account of Highers obtained in the fifth
year.
You also record the number of pupils who obtained Ds in their Highers,
as if a D was a pass. However, in tabulating the results of state
schools the Scottish Office regards a D as a failure.
Independent schools have always been good at presenting their
achievements in the best possible light. However I was disappointed to
see The Herald failing to issue a health warning to the effect that
these results cannot be compared to those issued by the Scottish Office
in relation to state schools.

THE Usher Hall in Edinburgh, tired of its image as just another
concert hall, has re-invented itself. The venerable domed building,
manager Moira McKenzie tells us, has an ''energetic, new look,
alive-and-kicking approach''.
Inevitably, this new look comes complete with a new logo (see below).
It is a curved line.
But not just any curved line. Moira adds: ''The new-look logo has a
story behind it. It represents a marriage of old and new, classic and
modern. Above an elegant typeface is a musical tie: its shape echoing
the Usher Hall's domed roof: its meaning -- to carry the note and let
the music play.'' (The use of colons is entirely the Usher Hall's own. A
musical tie is not an article of neckwear which bursts into tune but is
the curved line to be found on sheet music.)
The logo, or wee bendy line as we prefer to call it, reminds us more
of the kind of frothy head you might have got on a pint of ale as
dispensed by Andrew Usher, the brewing magnate who put up the cash for
the hall in the first place.
But anyway, full marks to Moira McKenzie for kicking the Usher Hall
into the 1990s. And we're not just saying that because she obviously
learnt well in her years at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. Nor even do
we say this in the hope of getting a free ticket or two for the Kenny
Rogers concert in the Usher Hall later this month.
Hair-brained
THE scene is the primary 1 class of Jordanhill School in the leafy
western suburbs of Glasgow. Teacher is giving a wee lesson on shops and
shopping.
What would you be doing if you were in a barber shop, she asks.
''Buying a waxed jacket,'' replies one of the pupils.
Cultural vein
THE tremendous input into Scotland's cultural life by Scottish
Television has become apparent over the Edinburgh Festival period. Or,
to put it another way, the world of the arts is fairly loupin' with high
heid yins who have one thing in common -- they are all members of the
board of directors of the Cowcaddens broadcasting company.
Recent recruit to the Scottish TV Elizabeth Smith, or Baroness Smith
of Gilmorehill as she is now called, is the new chairman of the
Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Managing director Gus Macdonald, or Angus as
he is now called, is chairman of the Edinburgh Film Festival as well as
being visiting professor of film and TV at Stirling.
Bill Brown, or William as he is sometimes known, is chairman of the
Scottish Arts Council. Angus Grossart, or Gus as he is rarely known, is
chairman of the board of trustees (not to be confused with trusties) of
the National Galleries of Scotland.
Allan Shiach, or Allan Scott as he is known when writing movie
scripts, is chairman of the Scottish Film Council. (Enough jobs for the
boys -- Ed.)
Censored
WE have reports of great intellectual debate at the Edinburgh
Television Festival. Well, not really, but we have some detail of a
final leave-them-with-a-laugh session conducted by Stuart Cosgrove, the
Channel 4 executive famous for putting filth on the telly and supporting
St Johnstone FC.
Stuart posed this situation to the collected captains of the TV
industry: ''You wake up hungover in the Stakis Grosvenor, realising you
should be in the Caledonian. On the pillow beside you is the face of the
researcher you were told to fire.'' He then gave three options as to how
to cope with this situation.
One Ms Debbie Mason of Kudos Productions opted for a fourth solution.
She wrote on her card, and Stuart read out loud: ''I would f*** him and
fire him.''
Stuart said of solutions which Debbie had suggested to further
hypothetical situations: ''Sorry, I couldn't possibly read that out in
public.'' Which gave pause to delegates as they recalled that Stu's most
frequently used words in the session had been shag, shagged, and
shaggable.
And all of this delivered beneath the cross in the church of St Andrew
and St George, the venue for which an earlier TV fest session, Beyond
the Pale, was pulled because, as chairperson Jane Root explained: ''It
was felt that a church would not be an appropriate place for showing
scenes of sex, violence, and drug-taking censored from various
productions.'' This session was called TV Scruples.

Anne Johnstone reports on the troubled career of Murray Easton in his
battle to keep Yarrow afloat
LIFE at Yarrow Shipbuilders was never going to be easy for Murray
Easton. He took over the hot seat in September 1991, one of the most
difficult moments in the Clyde yard's 88-year history. The end of the
Cold War had brought a peace dividend. For Britain's premier warship
builders that meant one thing: adapt or die. But, as with the high-speed
frigates they produce, the act of turning round and finding a new course
is easier said than done.
For most managing directors that would be quite enough to cope with.
Easton had another problem. His immediate predecessor was his own
father, the craggy living legend, Sir Robert Easton. The son never quite
escaped the father's tall shadow. Senior figures in the Clyde
shipbuilding establishment inevitably judged the son to be ''not a chip
off the old block''. The son lacks the father's bluff manner and his
presence.
Bob had gone to Yarrow as a manager in 1951, the year Murray was born.
By the time the son emerged from Bearsden Academy, dad was deputy
managing director. Throughout the young man's studies in mechanical
engineering and ship production at Paisley College of Technology and
Strathclyde University, he was a Yarrow-sponsored apprentice. By 1977
dad was managing director and son was an assistant manager, working on
Iranian support ships. The following year he took over co-ordination of
a prototype frigate project. However competent, with this kind of CV,
Easton the Younger was bound to be charged with hitching a ride on dad's
coat tails.
With this in mind perhaps, he moved south in 1982 to the Birkenhead
yard of Cammell Laird, as production director. There followed a
five-year stint on new and diversified projects for the yard, including
a Type 42 destroyer and a semi-submersible drilling platform. By 1987 he
was back at Scotstoun as operations director and from then on there
seemed little doubt that he would end up in the top job. In 1991, Sir
Robert celebrated his 40th year at Yarrow and his 70th birthday by
vacating the MD's chair for his son. The father remains chairman of GEC
Scotland (Manufacturing), a division of Yarrow's parent company.
At first things went reasonably well. In April 1992 Sir Bob travelled
to Malaysia to clinch a #400m order for two frigates. Two months earlier
there had been a life-saving order of the same magnitude from the Royal
Navy for three Type 23 frigates. But those five ships are now nearing
completion. Murray Easton has spent the past four years pounding the
pavements of the world in search of more work for the yard without
success.
One senior Yarrow executive said yesterday: ''He's gone everywhere --
South Africa, Brunei -- anywhere there was any possibility of work. The
only time he looked happy was when he came back from South Africa once
with what looked like good news but it hasn't produced anything.
Recently he has looked more and more haggard. His eyes are all sunken.
He looks like a man under pressure.'' He lists his hobbies as ice and
rock climbing and sailing but since 1991 he's had little time for
recreation.
Nevertheless, few of the workers had kind words for Easton this week
when the news of his resignation broke at the works like a shell in the
market-place. Many assumed they would be casualties soon in what looks
distinctly like a GEC-inspired attempt to put its mark on the company
which it has hitherto run on a long loose rein.
Yarrow seems more than likely to get the next Royal Navy order for
three Type 23s, due to be announced this November, but that isn't enough
to sustain the 3000-strong workforce and, besides, there are fears that
the timetable could slip again. Meanwhile, there isn't another order in
sight. Yarrow is thought to be an outsider in the running for an order
to supply the South African navy with four corvettes. So yesterday many
of the workers were wondering if soon they too would be going through
the gates ''to spend more time with the family'' (Easton's official
reason for going).
The atmosphere at the yard had changed abruptly with the appointment
two years ago of Keith Kirkpatrick as production manager. Easton had
worked with him at Cammel Laird where the ex-plater had risen through
the ranks and headhunted him to tackle the Clyde yard's abysmal
industrial-relations record and boost productivity. Kirkpatrick quickly
acquired the nickname ''Rottweiler'' among the workforce and his
aggressive management style caused widespread resentment. His arrival
was followed by the yard's first all-out strike in 20 years.
Now Easton himself appears to have fallen victim to the new management
style being imposed by GEC. July saw the arrival of Brian George,
brought in by the conglomerate as chief executive of GEC Marine to knit
together the operations at Yarrow and VSEL, the Barrow yard they bought
earlier this year. Yarrow has also recently appointed a GEC-approved
quality director, which is interpreted by many as a sure sign that the
parent company is proposing to go through the Clyde yard with a new
broom. This operation appears to have started at the top.
After the VSEL deal, GEC issued assurances that Yarrow would remain in
operation for at least seven years ''provided it remained profitable''.
Last year it made #11.6m on a turnover of #204m but given the state of
the order book this was unlikely to continue. Yarrow has considerable
strengths, particularly on the computer-aided design side, but the
facilities at the Barrow yard are more flexible and expandable. If it
came to a need for further rationalisation many fear the Clyde yard
would lose the contest.
Some of Yarrow's problems may be more psychological than technical.
The yard has been criticised for its ''ministry mentality'', always
expecting more manna from the Ministry of Defence, long after it should
have been looking to diversify into non-military areas.
Professor Douglas Faulkener, head of shipbuilding at Glasgow
University, said yesterday: ''I have a lot of respect for Yarrow, but if
the yard is to survive it needs to diversify. An obvious area would be
fast marine transport such as large Seacats for passengers and freight,
for which there is likely to be a growing market in both Europe and the
Far East.
''At first they would have to create partnerships with companies like
FBM Marine in the Isle of Wight but, given their design capabilities,
soon they could be coming up with their own designs. The Japanese are
putting six years of research into their 'techno superliner' so that
when this market emerges, they will be the market leaders. I'd feel
sorry if GEC missed out on such opportunities.''
Whoever takes over the helm at Yarrow from Murray Easton will have to
capitalise on the technical strengths of the yard by finding something
other than warships to build.

AUDREY SCOTT examines the evidence which suggests there may be a
connection between the measles vaccine and Crohn's disease
MEASLES is a common illness affecting mostly young children around
four years of age. Usually the infection is mild and lasts seven to 10
days.
The real problem with the disease is that complications can set in.
The older the child is, the more likely this will be. These range from
infections of the middle ear, to sinusitis and bronchitis. In severe
cases permanent hearing loss can occur.
The rarest but most dangerous complication is that the brain can
itself become infected with the measles virus.
This is called encephalitis -- and it can be fatal. Around one in
every 10,000 people who develop this will die from it. If a child
survives encephalitis he or she is likely to have sustained irreparable
brain damage.
The only real treatment for measles is bed rest, fluids and
paracetamol to tackle the pain and the high temperature. A vaccine
against the measles virus has been available since the 1960s. But its
use is controversial. The debate heightened recently with the
publication in the medical journal, The Lancet, of a paper by
researchers at London's Royal Free Hospital.
The report concerned the theory that the measles vaccine is involved
in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) -- the most
notable of these conditions being Crohn's disease.
The scientists at the Royal Free Hospital set out to investigate the
theory that the measles virus, when it has been altered to produce the
measles vaccine, causes IBD and in particular, Crohn's disease.
They compared the rates of IBD among 11,000 people of the same age who
have never received the measles vaccine. They found that measles virus
could be detected in the intestines of many people but especially those
with IBD.
In a separate study, incidence of Crohn's Disease was found to have
increased six times during the period from 1978-1988. The same time that
the measles vaccine had been in use in mass immunisation programmes. The
Royal Free Hospital group cited this as further evidence that the
measles vaccine causes IBD. The release of their report coincided with
the launch of a mass measles vaccination programme for five to
16-year-olds by the Government.
People were concerned about whether or not to allow their child to be
vaccinated against measles and possibly run the risk of them developing
IBD later in later life.
The work carried out by the researchers would appear, on the surface
at least, to strongly support the theory that the measles virus is
involved in some way in the development of IBD.
However, there is little evidence apart from the Royal Free study to
prove that the measles vaccine actually causes IBD.
Evidence of a link between IBD and the measles vaccine or virus is in
fact disputed by other scientists. Most notable in this respect has been
the work of two groups: one in London, and one in Perth.
These groups deny that the measles vaccine, or the virus itself, is in
any way responsible for IBD. Instead, their findings hint that it is a
bacterium that is involved.
They believe that Myco Bacterium Para TB (MTB) is really the cause of
IBD. Research carried out by the scientists in London and Perth showed
that all the Crohn's disease sufferers they studied had MTB present in
their intestines. This led them to conclude that MTB is the causative
agent of IBS -- Crohn's disease in particular.
MTB originates in digestive tracts of rabbits. Their droppings
contaminate grass. Cows eat the grass -- and the MTB, and so humans
become infected if they eat the contaminated beef.  Around 3% of beef in
the UK was found to have high levels of MTB in a recent test.
Such data although important, only serves to confuse the situation.
More research is needed to discover if there really is a link between
receiving the measles vaccine or infection with the MTB bacteria and the
development of IBD in adult life. It must never be forgotten how common
measles is and how serious the consequences of contracting measles can
be.
The Government has promised to look closely at the results of the
study at the Royal Free Hospital and any other new work that is carried
out on this subject.
In the meantime, the World Health Organisation, the Department of
Health, and nursing bodies all advise parents to have their children
vaccinated.
After all, the risk of developing IBD after a measles vaccination is
around one in one million. Compare this to the one-in-1500 chance of
developing measles encephalitis after infection with the measles virus
itself.

NOBODY ever claimed it was going to be easy, so it would be wrong to
despair on the first anniversary of the ceasefire that the peace process
in Ulster has hit fresh snags. At least it has held for a year in spite
of the fact that for every man of violence relishing his new-found role
of politician -- being a public figure appearing on television can be
heady -- there is one who longs for the authority he acquired from the
gun. Tribalism, with all the innate, blind, irrational hatred that
entails, is as prevalent in Ulster as in Rwanda or the former
Yugoslavia. There are, therefore, bound to be acts of violence while the
peace process makes its tortuous way towards its goal. What matters is
that these prove sporadic, not part of a new, sustained campaign of
atrocities by either side.
There is a tendency to blame any hitch on Westminster, the British
Government being the traditional scapegoat of Irish politics. But
Britain has moved. IRA prisoners have been transferred from British to
Northern Ireland jails, Sir Patrick Mayhew has talked to representatives
of Sinn Fein, and last week's package of proposals, once unthinkable, is
further evidence it is not we who are stuck in the mud. Sinn Fein may
have dismissed them as derisory and insulting, but that was probably
just a kneejerk reaction. Gerry Adams said at the weekend that his
representatives had remained in contact with ministers since the last
time he met Sir Patrick and his deputy, Mr Michael Ancram, in July and
he has been invited to new talks soon. A sign of movement from the IRA
on handing over weapons is what is needed. Progress on the handover, not
abandonment -- or at least not just yet since Sir Patrick has been
careful never to ask the impossible -- of weapons has to be made by the
IRA.
Mr Major will meet the Irish Prime Minister, Mr John Bruton, on
Wednesday in Dublin which is some light in the gloom because it had
looked as if the summit, planned for this weekend, might have had to be
delayed until later in the month because of the difficulties that have
arisen. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish Foreign Minister, said yesterday,
however, that the two governments were very close to arriving at
conclusions and it goes ahead. The Prime Minister's record on many areas
of policy may be poor, but on Northern Ireland he has shown a
determination to succeed that commands, indeed demands, respect, and he
can be expected to use the summit to the full. The line to the IRA runs
not just through Dublin, but the meeting is nevertheless important
because it provides another opportunity to show the two governments are
continuing to work in unison, not just harmony, a vital factor in the
whole process.
Another factor deciding the shape of things to come will be the result
of the election for the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party to be
held in 10 days' time. There are four possible candidates, of whom Mr
John Taylor, MP for Strangford, is the favourite. Their decisions will
be made known at tomorrow's meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council in
Belfast and the result of the leadership election will be awaited with
anxiety in both Westminster and Dublin. Mr James Molyneaux, who is what
is commonly called a downy old bird, understood the ways of Westminster
and was respected in Dublin. He is a hard act to follow and some of
those who would succeed are wilder men of less political sophistication.

DENNIS Potter's eye was so directed towards the television camera that
stage performance runs an automatic risk. This production of his story
of childhood in the Forest of Dean becomes enmeshed in the Potter snares
from its beginning and never climbs out of the bog.
The student actors do bring an added dimension to the
adult-playing-young-child set-up which Potter envisaged. But on the
whole, they try too hard to play their age down, and the result is
strained mimicry.
A more imaginative response to the staging problems and better
direction are needed to make this production move.

DEBBIE Horsfield's play, which revolves around the quest of four
female Manchester United supporters to watch their idols play in the Cup
Final, has been updated from its original eighties setting (before Man U
reached mega-being status) to 1995, with remarkable smoothness.
It's a funny and punchy script which depicts four strong female
characters, just on the right side of caricature. The slag, the tomboy,
the thicky, and the sensible one, are brought to life energetically and
convincingly in Virgo Intacta's well-cast production.
But the humour fades, things turning heavy and ugly, as a grim picture
of the girls' aspirations, the unglamorous reality of their lives,
emerges. Not really, after all, a play about football, but it could well
all be about goals, Bob.

SIPPING a cup of tea in a guest house in Killala, County Mayo, in the
west of Ireland on the eve of the first anniversary of the IRA
ceasefire, the country's former Prime Minister Albert Reynolds was asked
by a well-wisher what he would have expected the situation to be one
year on.
''To still be in office as Prime Minister,'' he laughed.
Though a back bencher since his fall from power last November over
unfounded allegations of a state cover-up to shield a paedophile priest
from extradition to Northern Ireland, Reynolds has continued to speak
out as the unofficial republican custodian of the peace process.
While this high-profile stance has made Reynolds the darling of Irish
nationalists, it has transformed him into the role of Downing Street's
bete noir.
His basic demand that talks -- without deadlines on decommissioning of
IRA arms or without predetermined solutions -- should start immediately
has attracted widespread applause in the Irish Republic and from Sinn
Fein and the SDLP.
But while Reynolds has made all the media running ahead of the
ceasefire anniversary, his successor, John Bruton, has remained
tight-lipped about his approach.
With a summit meeting with John Major still provisionally scheduled to
take place in Dublin next Wednesday, Bruton believes that secret
diplomacy with Britain should not be put at risk by media-driven
comments.
The welcome in Dublin last Friday for the speech by Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary -- announcing a 50% remission for
jailed paramilitaries and promising a White Paper on policing in the
province -- was notably lukewarm.
An insight into the Dublin Government's strategy was given on Sunday
by its Chief Whip, Jim Higgins. When addressing the Humbert School peace
forum in Killala on Sunday, he insisted that there will have to be a
decommissioning of all weapons. Behind the scenes the Irish Government
is pressing for the establishment of an international commission to
break the arms log-jam.
Yesterday Dick Spring, the Irish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister, confirmed that arrangements are still being made for next
week's summit, but he admitted that there was no agreement yet between
Dublin and London on decommissioning, policing and prisoners, and the
review of emergency legislation in Northern Ireland.
''It is important that both Governments drive forward the process,''
he said. ''There is a sense of frustration 12-months later that we are
no nearer to all-party talks. But in fairness, there are obstacles in
the way of these talks and we have to remove those obstacles.''
The yawning gulf between entrenched political ideologies over the
future status of Northern Ireland and the public desire for a permanent
peace has never been more acute than on the first anniversary of the IRA
ceasefire.
An attempt to provide a forum to express this public exasperation and
impatience at the immobility of the political system was provided at
Killala where about 1200 people listened carefully for three hours to
the principal architects on the Irish side of the ceasefire -- Hume,
Adams, and Reynolds.
But remarkably, the conference was also addressed by Dr John
Alderdice, the leader of the Alliance Party in Northern Ireland, while
the previous evening David Ervine, the spokesman for the Progressive
Unionist Party, became the first Ulster Loyalist to address a public
meeting in County Mayo since the partition of Ireland in 1922.
The annual Humbert peace prize was, remarkably, awarded to Major and
Adams, along with Hume and Reynolds.
And when the commendation was made on behalf of John Major, there was
not one hiss or walk-out; there was applause -- admittedly not as
enthusiastic as for Reynolds, Hume and Adams -- but applause none the
less.
This is an enormous psychological change in a part of Ireland renowned
for its entrenched republicanism. The Governments and political
commentators in Dublin and London need to take closer note of the new
mood in Mayo.

HIS perkily relentless charm allows Tim Vine to overcome two
unfortunate handicaps. First, Tim's flaxen hair and sharp features give
him a damning resemblance to Peter Davidson, justly derided as the small
screen's most ineffectual Dr Who. Secondly, there's Tim's material, a
ceaseless flood of tired puns and tatty music-hall one-liners.
Does this feast of bad gags indicate that Tim, the official Perrier
newcomer of '95, is deliberately acting as an ironic
comedy-deconstructionist? Dunno. I do know, however, that in the bygone
days of yore the Glasgow Empire would have killed him. Go along nowadays
and you'll groan indulgently more often than you'll laugh, but at least
you won't throw bricks. Social progress, if not great comedy.

TODAY we celebrate the anniversary of the terrorist ceasefire.
Tomorrow is another day in the peace process, but we now dare to hope
that, after 25 years, atrocity has been deinstitutionalised in Northern
Ireland.
Sir Patrick Barnabas Burke Mayhew -- named for two saints and the
celebrated political ancestor -- the man who has been at the heart of
this agonising enigma, is something of an enigma himself. Even now,
three years into the task of Northern Ireland Secretary and 66 next
month, people don't know quite what to make of him.
What is the true nature of this 6ft 4ins tall gentleman with colossal
accessories for feet whose mother's Protestant Ascendancy County Cork
blood rushes through him? Irish? English? Both?
He's a plummy Irishman, a contradiction in terms. Perhaps this is the
secret of his success in Ireland where there is an almighty passion for
conundrums. Success? Well, we have the retrospective luxury on August 31
of 365 days of merely sporadic and largely rogue violence in the north.
If all else fails, Paddy Mayhew seems set for his place in history,
along with John Major.
They stand together these two, the last grandee in Cabinet and the boy
from Brixton, an essential quotient in the politics of Ireland, north
and south. It is clear to all that they cannot be divided. They are not
only friends, but confidantes. As so often happens in politics, their
roles were once reversed and Mayhew was Major's boss.
''I want you for my PPS,'' says Paddy to John, (only three years an
MP) in 1981 when Mayhew became No. 2 at the Home Office. Eleven years
later, the parliamentary private secretary had become Prime Minister. He
elevated a somewhat reluctant Government legal officer (Attorney
General) into a uniquely eager Northern Ireland Secretary.
Most politicians regard Northern Ireland as the proverbial poisoned
chalice, but Mayhew regarded it as a positive boon. It brought him back
to politics for which he had discarded his career as a QC to become MP
for Tunbridge Wells in 1974. He grumbled when Thatcher made him
Solicitor General and then Attorney General, ''a bourn from which no
political traveller returns'' in 1987.
He was not quite ''One of Us'' as far as she was concerned, although
she admired him despite two blazing rows on trade union reform when he
was working with the ''wet'' Jim Prior at employment. She was not all
that keen on patrician Tories, although he has modelled himself on
Viscount Whitelaw, particularly in Northern Ireland. It was convenient
to give him four years as a legal officer, neither fish nor fowl in
political terms.
So when her successor took him out of the law office, Mayhew was
delighted. Their friendship has prospered into one of those happy
partnerships of straight-talking and mutual respect that can be the
harbinger of genuine political achievement.
Thus, last July, when the beleaguered Major was contemplating his bold
leadership re-election, it was Mayhew who urged him on with one of his
favourite phrases: ''It's shit-or-bust time.'' A value of Mayhew's
political advice to Major is that he has no other ambition other than to
continue what he is doing as long as he believes that his Irish ancestry
exploits a special insight.
The young Mayhew was sent to Tonbridge Public School and followed his
father to Balliol, Oxford where he gained an ''idle'' Third in Law, but
also, the Presidency of the Oxford Union. This cachet was not, however,
sufficient for his bar pupil chambers to accept him. So his father's
friend Lord Kilmuir helped him elsewhere. No doubt his Guardsman's
height helped him catch the eye for dock briefs as a fledgling
barrister, but it took him almost five years to pay off his debts.
He did his National Service and Army Emergency Reserve in the Royal
Dragoon Guards and maintained his family's love for horses and dogs --
and self-mockery. He joined the Beaufort Hunt: ''I always hunted in
two-horse country, but I could never afford a second one.'' By this time
he was also hunting a different quarry. It is a romantic tale of dogged
persistence on his part.
Jean Gurney, then a Cambridge student, came from a Suffolk Quaker
family and he proposed to her on their sixth date. She turned him down
again and again and again. But she found him loving and funny. She is
well to the left of his politics and heated debates ensued; at the
height of one of them, he scored a plaintive point: ''I'm asking you to
marry me, not vote for me.''
She relented and the couple left for Kenya, engaged, for a holiday
which she was to combine with trying to teach African women craft
skills. They fell out of love and into it again. A sea urchin saved the
romance by impregnating her foot with 30-odd of its spines. One by one
he painstakingly removed them and this ''tender loving care'' reinstated
the engagement.
Lady Mayhew is now the perfect consort for her husband whose dominion
in Northern Ireland entails a #7000m budget which the Treasury has only
recently sought to cap. Even so, once he has wrangled the money out of
them, he can spend it just as he likes. He has Hillsborough Castle as a
home and a stately one at that for official entertainment.
He likes to think of himself as a patrician with the common touch. He
believes that Northern Ireland's Protestant population trusts him,
although on one celebrated walkabout occasion an old lady would not
allow him to help her across the street with her bike. ''What, trust you
with my bike?'' she retorted. He tells this one against himself.
The Unionists, now sparring for the successorship to Jim Molyneaux,
are alternately beguiled by his charm and straight-talking and
profoundly suspicious. They believe that he is giving Gerry Adams, step
by step, what he wants. Mr Adams insists on calling him ''Mr'' Mayhew;
Mayhew, for his part, avoids calling him names of any kind. Their
meetings, as in Washington, are strictly formal.
His relationship with the Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, the
former rugby international and leader of the Labour Party, is of an
entirely different kind. Indeed, its continuity has been essential to
the joint Irish-UK peace initiative.
Mayhew has a temper which has been sorely tested, less by the Irish
than President Clinton in the White House. He has wrong-footed Mayhew
several times over the past year on the Adams issue, according the Sinn
Fein leader what he has always wanted, worldwide fame on the Yasser
Arafat scale.
Next week, Major and he are scheduled for another summit with the
Irish Premier Bruton and Dick Spring. The ''plummy Irishman' Paddy
Mayhew will be playing his intrinsic part in trying to stack the
Armalites for ever and providing, for good and all, the ballot box.

THE statement which the Irish Republican Army released a year ago gave
no hint of the months of secret talks and negotiations which led to its
historic decision to call a ceasefire.
Issued at 11am on August 31, 1994, it simply declared that the IRA
campaign would halt. Thus did 25 years of appalling violence come to an
end with no promise that the cessation was ''permanent'' and no sign
that the guns and explosives in the hands of the terrorists would be
handed over or destroyed.
In the 12-months since, the unwillingness of the IRA to go beyond that
initial simple statement has tempered the sense of elation and relief of
Protestants and Catholics alike. The ceasefire has meant not a total
peace but a qualified peace. Brutal punishment beatings continue. So,
too, does intimidation.
Sectarian violence, short of the use of guns and bombs, in the form of
arson attacks on churches and halls on both sides is a regular
occurrence. This summer has also brought bitter street clashes in
Belfast, Londonderry, Portadown and other centres as Orangemen insist on
mounting traditional parades in or near Catholic neighbourhoods.
Such incidents, and there have been many, confirm that the body
politic of Northern Ireland is still beset with a serious undercurrent
of violence.
That said, the ceasefire period has demonstrated an impressive degree
of self-discipline on the part of all the terrorist groupings. The most
serious IRA breach was the killing of a Post Office worker in Newry
during a robbery but, other than that, guns and bombs have become
yesterday's weapons. In their place, the more conventional weapons of
urban violence -- from broken paving-stones to petrol bombs hurled at
police, or cudgels used in punishment beatings, have become the tools of
those who still wish to keep the pot boiling.
It could be argued that such violence is an escape valve for
militants. The so-called ''volunteers'' in the republican and Loyalist
terror groups are occupied in this way or, as police suspect, in
continuing to gather information on possible targets in the event of the
ceasefire breaking down. As most people in the north, including police
and prison officers, drop their guard, and freedom of movement improves
in the absence of security checkpoints, so members of the IRA, UDA and
UVF do not have the same pressures of surveillance upon them, nor the
same risk of arrest as before.
The social impact of the past year of relative peace is evident
everywhere. As if overnight, security barriers in cities, towns, and
villages have come down. The border is now more open than at any time
since the partition of the island in 1920. The surfaces of minor roads
that were cratered by the security forces have been filled in and
re-opened. At major crossing points such as outside Newry on the main
Belfast-to-Dublin road, the Army's fortress-like checkpoint stands empty
and traffic flows freely through. It is the same story along the entire
meandering 300-mile length of the border.
Northern Ireland's economy has been both boosted and dented in the
past year. The tourists have returned in force from Britain and from the
Irish Republic.
However, the boom in tourism has brought its embarrassments. After so
many years of violence, hotel bedrooms are in short supply, a point
which will be underlined in December when President Clinton pays a
historic visit to the province. The absence of sufficient hotel
accommodation is given as the official reason why he and a vast
entourage of American officials and foreign journalists will not stay
overnight in Belfast.
Nevertheless, the prospect of a peaceful future is luring the big
hotel chains and plans are already in place for many new developments,
ranging from multi-storey hostelries in Belfast to smaller
moderately-priced motels.
In terms of investment, the biggest peace package has come from the
European Union. Its #250m will go towards rejuvenating troubled
neighbourhoods and even towards the rehabilitation of former terrorists
among the hundreds expected to be given early release from prison.
A year of peace is a start but not enough for potential foreign
investors. They prefer to adopt a wait-and-see policy which means any
benefit will be longer term.
In the meantime, there is a downside. Police officers have lost
lucrative overtime payments and may soon lose their jobs, if the peace
holds. Security personnel who once guarded virtually every business now
face unemployment.
Conversely, house prices in the province are up about 10% on last year
while unemployment, despite the lay-offs in security, has fallen by
10,000. With each passing day, Belfast develops a degree of normality
that its younger citizens have never known, even if IRA and Loyalist
murals on gable walls are a reminder that beneath the surface this is
not quite like any other British city.
The ceasefires provoke a different reaction among Protestant and
Catholic factions. The latter are more optimistic that peace will hold
and impatient for all-party political talks to begin. Another marked
difference lies in the Catholic willingness to embrace Sinn Fein as well
as hard-line Loyalists in future talks, and to press for early prison
releases of convicted terrorists on both sides. In constrast, many
mainstream Protestants show little enthusiasm for such moves.
Broadly speaking, the Protestant and Catholic communities seem
prepared to pay a different price for peace. No-one wants it to end but
Protestants show increasing signs of digging in for a long political
battle of wills with London and Dublin, while Catholics feel now is the
time for decisive action and a lasting settlement.
The past year has narrowed the gap in thinking between extreme and
moderate nationalists. The Unionists charge that this new liaison is a
''pan-nationalist front'' encompassing Ireland's Catholic primate,
Cardinal Cahal Daly, SDLP leader John Hume, former Irish Prime Minister
Albert Reynolds, and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams.
This formidable chorus of Catholic nationalist voices is in contrast
to the disillusionment and disjointedness inside the Unionist camp. One
leader, James Molyneaux, has just stood down and another, the Rev Ian
Paisley, rejects the peace process as a nationalist conspiracy to
disconnect Northern Ireland from the UK.
Both the British and Irish governments seem determined to press on
regardless of Paisley but taking more account of the sensitivities of
Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist Party which will elect a new leader next
week. But with Protestant opinion so split, the prospects for finding a
formula for all-party talks, never mind an eventual settlement, look
remote.
London and Dublin have yet to even agree on the ''decommissioning'' of
IRA weapons. At best, Prime Minister John Major and the Irish leader,
John Bruton, are likely to announce some form of international
commission when they meet for a September summit, and attempt to
kick-start the peace process.
Could violence return? The security forces are still guarded and do
not rule out an IRA split as the hard-liners in border counties of
Tyrone, Fermanagh and Armagh grow increasingly restless at what they see
as little return for the ceasefire.
Observers believe they can be kept in check by the Sinn Fein
leadership at least until 1996 and until after President Clinton's
visit. As that visit nears, so the pressure will increase on all sides
to move towards all-party talks and negotiations.
After a year of peace, Northern Ireland's political leaders face a
winter ahead which could have even more historic repercussions than the
ceasefires of 1994. Persuading the IRA to stop was one thing. Despite 12
months of cherished peace, finding a lasting political settlement will
be quite another.
Ceasefire statement
''Recognising the potential of the current situation and in order to
enhance the democratic process, and underlying our definitive commitment
to its success, the leadership of the IRA have decided that as of
midnight, August 31, there will be a complete cessation of military
operations. All our units have been instructed accordingly''

THE work of ''playwright'' Richard Foreman, if indeed the succession
of fragmented incidents, utterings, and characters which make up his
text can be described as a ''play'', is firmly rooted in the American
experimental theatre of the sixties, the breeding ground of such
post-modern performance luminaries as The Wooster Group.
Theatre Pur creates a theatrical playground; suggesting the druggy
Bohemian environment of a New York loft through a worrying predilection
for kitsch crochet, tassles, and primary-coloured spirals; in which to
act out Foreman's musings on the nature of language, identity and
experience, complete with a good dollop of late-sixties sexual
pre-occupation. Reasonably diverting and confidently handled though it
is, the piece remains something of a period curio.

KAY CARMICHAEL
looks at a
campaign to give
the disabled
more control over
their lives
JULIE was in her twenties, married, with three children under five.
Looking after them was not easy since she had a back problem. An
operation was suggested: ''it went wrong'' and she came out of hospital
knowing she would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair. That, she
says, was when the nightmare started.
Her husband, she was told, would have to give up his job to look after
her and the children. She rejected that out of hand. She knew such a
solution would be intolerable for both of them. Other options -- herself
going into residential care or the children being taken into care --
were delicately insinuated. She thought of slitting her wrists.
At that stage no-one told her that it would be possible to get grants
to employ people to work for her in her own home and to re-establish
some of the life she had lost. It was not the physical damage she had
suffered that had disabled her. It was the obstacles society put in her
way which prevented her continuing to contribute to her family and the
community.
Julie was lucky. She found an advocate who, using the experience and
knowledge of the Lothian Centre for Integrated Living, arranged a
financial package which enables her to have the help she needs to bring
up her children and, with her husband, live an independent life.
Recently she came to a conference to support the creation of a Glasgow
Centre for Independent Living. This will make available to disabled
people in Glasgow the information and support which she had needed.
No-one, she says, should have to experience what she did.
The conference was planned and organised in every detail by a small
group of disabled people representing nine organisations. It was the
first of its kind in Scotland. It was daunting. Try finding a venue that
can cope with 50 wheelchair-users all needing access to lavatories, to
the dining room, and to fire exits as well as to the conference room.
Think of organising a conference where, in addition to the delegates,
you need to have on hand 20 or so non-disabled people to act as legs and
hands for those people who don't have the use of their own.
But think also of the speakers who came to share their experiences.
Most were wheelchair-users but some had, in addition, other disabilities
of speech and movement. That did not prevent them from making powerful
contributions. One session, on helping people to understand the role
personal assistants (PAs) can play in making independent living
possible, was deeply enriched by the contribution of Monica Elder
Woodward.
In spite of being almost totally disabled physically (other than
marginally turn her head she cannot move without help, needs help with
eating and drinking, is unable to speak, and is registered blind) her
spirituality and intelligence strike you like a burning light. Through
the voice of her PA she described how she continues to live at home,
with her partner, Jim Elder Woodward, also disabled and a member of the
steering committee which set up the conference. He works with
Strathclyde region.
Using central and local government resources, Monica employs one
full-time worker and nine part-time workers. These are Monica's PAs whom
she interviews and hires to work for her. She communicates with them by
using an alphabet board, an effective but time-consuming exercise. She
proves, by the way she lives, that a disabled person does not need to be
a passive recipient of care. This year she gained a first-class honours
degree in mathematics from the Open University and plans to continue to
study mathematical biology.
Research has shown that disabled people using PAs have less need of
health services. This is not surprising. People who can make choices and
have some control over their lives are happier and healthier. They are
also more likely to find opportunities to work. The research also found
that, even when provided for 24-hours a day, PAs are cheaper than a
package of community services or an institution. A positive side-effect
is that this work creates jobs and recycles the money in the community.
Disabled people need no longer be dependent on volunteers to meet
their basic needs. Such dependency can destroy relationships with family
and friends. Many families break up under the pressure of constant care,
no matter how loving their original intentions. Much sentimental
nonsense has been talked by Government about family care when what is
needed is funding, controlled by the disabled themselves, to enable them
to live with dignity.
The movement for independent living began in the 60s in California,
where a paralysed young man, Ed Roberts, persuaded the University of
California to take him as a student. The only place he could live was in
the hospital. A few followed him and between them they created the first
centre for independent living. The idea mushroomed throughout the US at
the same time as the civil rights movement.
The courage shown by blacks and women fighting oppression and
discrimination for equality and social justice was shared by the
disabled.
Scotland has come late to the struggle. The first English centre was
set up in 1981 by Rachel Hurst, an upmarket, feisty wheelchair-user who
has engaged in direct action, sitting down in front of a lorry to draw
attention to the aims of the movement. There are now three centres in
England. Lothian's was set up in 1991, with Marnie Roadburg, formerly a
housing worker, as co-ordinator of a mixed disabled and non-disabled
staff. The Glasgow preference could be for a wholly disabled staff. All
they await now is the funding.

THE skirt in question is the voluminous one of the Portuguese painter
Paula Rego, whose life is the inspiration for this ingenious, witty
piece by Dog Theatre, a show whose charm builds stealthily over its
hour-long duration, leaving you quite enraptured by the end.
Director Anat Raphael has a great gift for visual flair, constantly
surprising and delighting her audience with striking tableaux and
setting the scenes which evoke Rego's life, dreams and paintings against
the backdrop of a screen awash with emotive colour, from sexy scarlet to
chilly blue.
While a few dance sequences were gauche, the company clearly have an
instinct for and command of physical theatre and the young cast --
Rebecca Manley, Peter Collins, Sophie Duval and Nicky Thornton -- give
winning, playful performances which are highly commendable.

FIRST, take the Juice Pigs' technical accomplishments. Guitar,
mandolin, keyboards, and fiddle come together with seriously inventive
vocal harmonies to produce a show which, if it wasn't an insane
triple-parody of pop cliche, audience responses and the trio themselves,
would still be a great gig.
They can simultaneously do the voices of Billy Bragg, Morrissey, and
the Proclaimers in one song and make it sound like a hit. Then there's
the lunacy. Phil ends up inside Greg's shirt to become a
sexually-rampant Siamese twin. Sean does a filthy Pope, a handless
child, and a ''little ducky'' before pursuing that truly
extra-terrestrial comic thought. Corky and the Juice Pigs string pearls
of chaos on a perfect thrill of skill and timing.

THIS is Rae's best show in ages. For a long time she had an
irresistible urge to obliterate her jewel colours with a big back brush.
The resulting murky mass of loose gestures were difficult to read and
her imagery, though rooted in landscape, became amorphous.
Now she returns to tactile surfaces alive with focus and incident
which still retain a spontaneous air. It takes consummate, professional
dare-devil expertise to orchestrate paintings like the powerfully
invigorating oil, Mull Ferry, its triangular pink sail in an intense
blue sea looking rather like an upturned ice-cream cone. I also enjoyed
Castelfiorentino, Black Venus Edinburgh, and Fading Sunset where Rae's
characteristic dark straggly branches frame an intense patchwork hill
field.
The etchings too are memorable: rare delights which not only translate
but transcend their original painted inspiration via embossed linear
calligraphy, as in Ploughmarks, or the burnished bronze of Monda Vine.

THE real meaning of Festival fever has become clear this week as
various members of our team, and of the casts we've been seeing, have
been succumbing to sore throats, upset stomachs, and the shakes:
obviously down to an insufficiency of germ-killing alchohol.
Maybe it's a coincidence, but the first symptoms began after
experiencing the Tap Dogs' show for the first time on Monday. The Tap
Dogs are a troupe of Australian male dancers who have undoubtedly been
the populist hit of the Festival. All over Edinburgh, ordinarily
respectable women are behaving as if they're on heat as they clamour for
tickets (yesterday black market tickets were a pinch at #100). Not a day
has passed without one or another of this paper's Tap Dog devotees
positively foaming at the mouth -- and all over our morning meeting. The
possibility of having T-shirts printed with the legend ''Tap Dogs: We
Want Your Puppies'' was even mooted.
Outside the Palladium on Monday there were packs of salivating
females. Some had dainty little signs asking for ''just one ticket'',
while others were forming orderly queues behind women who appeared to
have been stood up, and who might therefore have tickets to spare.
If you thought that tap dancing was for wimps and sophisticates --
forget it. More Cagney than Astaire, the Tap Dogs are swarthy, tough-guy
tappers dressed like construction workers. Although for the most part
they dance without musical accompaniment, what would be appropriate
would be a building-site variation on the classic title song from the
1935 dance extravaganza Top Hat -- I just got an invitation throught the
mail/Your presence requested this evening, informal, with hard hat,
ripped jeans and pail. Not only do the Tap Dogs tap, but they also sweat
buckets then pour them over strangely appreciative females in the front
row. And guess where The Herald party was sitting.
We had been warned: you'll get wet. But our boss is a Tap Bitch (in
the nicest possible way) who's seen the show at least five times. And
she wanted a good view.
She certainly got it; at least she did when she wasn't cowering under
a brolly along with yours truly and another Tap virgin. Thank God for
that umbrella: we were only inches from the Dogs' happy feet and when
they took to tapping in trays of water, there was more splashing than in
Singing In the Rain.
But there may be a safer way to enjoy the Tap Dogs: get a copy of the
video. Someone posing as a Herald photographer filmed the entire
performance, presumably with sales potential in mind. Either that or the
boss is about to find herself a victim of blackmail.
Tap Dogs: The Movie could well be at a coffee morning near you in
time to persuade you along to their imminent Glasgow debut.
Another dance company in town, as part of the official Festival, is
the Mark Morris Dance Group. Morris's The Hard Nut is an overtly camp,
updated version of The Nutcracker. Set in 1960s America, the characters
at the Christmas party wear Afro wigs while shimmying and shaking to
Tchaikovsky's music. In other words, not for the easily shocked. It
therefore came as somewhat of a surprise to learn that one of the first
eager ticket-buyers was the 80-odd-year-old great auntie of one of my
friends. Auntie Mary explained to my rather bewildered pal why she and
her chum had thought that The Hard Nut would be a nice night at the
ballet. My pal, in turn, had to point out that nice as it might be, what
The Hard Nut wasn't was The Nutcracker as performed by Morris dancers.
Walking back through the Grassmarket from fellow Festival flu-sufferer
Phil Kay's show at the Gilded Balloon last night brought back a memory
from the very first day of my Edinburgh stay (my Festival residency
outlasting anyone else's because the Jazz Festival runs through Week
Zero) -- the day of the Jazz Festival's stationary Mardi Gras.
It was a religious moment: my favourite band, The Hot Antics, were in
the middle of converting a crowd of passers-by, when (like Charlton
Heston's parting of the Red Sea), the congregation was parted in two by
one of the Grassmarket's residents. This black-faced, booze-guzzling
tramp -- who had presumably come along to check out exactly what it was
that had been disturbing his sleep -- stood entranced by the music.
Gradually, and with his bottle clutched to his chest, he began to sway
to it. What made this dervish-like dance so memorable was the
opportunity it provided for the Hot Antics' long-serving banjo player.
Jean-Pierre Dubois's Edinburgh party-piece for many years has been to
impress unsuspecting audiences with his command of Glaswegian slang. On
this particular day he finally found exactly the right circumstances in
which to yell (in heavily French accent): ''Gawn yersel Jimmy!''.

A GLASGOW man drove a leaking speedboat across Loch Lomond after he
had been drinking, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Colin Fleming had drunk ''possibly four pints'' before his boat was
damaged in a collision at Balmaha on the east bank of the loch, Stirling
Sheriff Court was told.
Without stopping to check for damage, Mr Fleming headed the boat
towards Luss on the opposite bank, where it sank 30 feet from the shore,
it was said.
Mr Fleming, 25, of Croftmoraig Avenue, Moodiesburn, Glasgow, denies
driving the boat culpably and recklessly near a jetty at Macfarlane's
boatyard, Balmaha, on July 9, 1994, causing it to collide with two other
boats moored there, and then driving the craft across the loch in a
damaged condition to the danger of his passenger, Mr Nicholas Ahrens.
He also denies a charge under the Merchant Shipping Act of failing to
keep a proper lookout.
His solicitor, Rick Ackland, gave notice that he would be asking the
sheriff to decide whether the loch counts as ''the high seas, or water
navigable by sea-going craft'' as defined in the Act.
Giving evidence, Mr Ahrens, 21, of Blairdenden Avenue, Moodiesburn,
Glasgow, said by the end of the night he was drunk but Mr Fleming had
drunk less than him -- possibily four pints.
Mr Ahrens estimated that the speedboat had been going at four or five
miles an hour when the collision occurred.
Earlier, vehicle examiner Mr Alexander Aitkenhead, 48, told the court
he was asleep in his cruiser, moored at Balmaha, when he was wakened by
heavy wash. He estimated it would have been generated by a speedboat
going at 25 knots.
He said he heard a bang and then a boat left the bay ''at great
speed''.
Owners of two boats which the prosecution claim were damaged estimated
damage at nearly #1600.
The trial was adjourned until October.

more than 40,000 spinal fractures each year.
Every three minutes someone in the UK suffers a broken bone due to
osteoporosis, yet the disease is largely preventable.
* Who is at risk of osteoporosis?
1 -- Women who are small-boned, take little exercise, smoke, drink and
have no dairy produce in their diet.
2 -- The earlier the menopause (natural or surgical) the greater the
risk of fractures and thinning of the bones.
3 -- Those who lack calcium in the diet, found mainly in milk and
cheese. The recommended daily intake is 500mg daily.
* Six tips to protect your bones *
1 -- Make certain young people get an adequate diet and exercise in
order to produce good bone mass.
2 -- Maintain exercise throughout adult life and make certain of an
adequate amount of calcium in diet.
3 -- Women should consider HRT around the menopause.
4 -- Maintain sensible body weight.
5 -- Make certain of getting daily exposure to sunlight, especially
elderly people.
6 -- Do not smoke and limit alcohol intake.

Ann Shaw explains why the fizzy drinks and crisps diet of many teenage
girls is turning them into 'time bombs' for future bone disease
FIONA watches her weight daily. She diets rigorously, eating nothing
until mid-morning then she drinks a can of diet cola. She's 14 and
wafer-thin. She never exercises, preferring instead to watch television
or listen to music.
Fiona looks healthy and that's how she perceives herself. But the
reality is different: the lack of calcium in her diet and exercise makes
her a prime candidate for thinning of the bones, or osteoporosis, in
later life.
She is typical of the girls interviewed for the Greater Glasgow Health
Board survey, Health Related Behaviour of Young People in Secondary
Schools, and it makes worrying reading.
It reveals that 20% of young girls do not take any milk, which means
they are almost certainly calcium deficient. Fewer than half take
regular exercise, and about 90% list their main activity as watching
television or listening to music.
Bone specialist Alistair McLellan at Glasgow Western Infirmary says
many fourth-year schoolgirls are already heading for problems: ''We
found that 20% had no milk in their diet. This will almost certainly
lead to calcium deficiency.''
While excessive drinking of diet cola drinks will not in itself lead
to calcium deficiency, it does have a negative influence since girls are
taking this in preference to more nourishing drinks.
Can excessive amounts of fizzy drinks be harmful? ''Most unlikely,''
says Dr Ian Coutts, endocrinologist at Glasgow University. ''You would
have to drink so much that you would develop side-effects and other
symptoms first.''
There is, however, clear evidence that soft drinks are bad for your
teeth.
On the surface, teenage girls appear to be more health-conscious than
boys, but that is due to their concern about weight: 60% of fourth-year
girls want to lose weight.
While breakfast is one meal of the day which is potentially easy to
make healthy, nearly a quarter of the girls in the survey had nothing to
eat or drink before leaving home. Yet cereals, toast, and fruit juices
make a good start to the day, offering a ready-made source of nutrients.
Most girls, suggests the survey, break their fast mid-morning with a
high-fat, or sugary snack, to keep them going until lunchtime. The
typical teenage diet of sweets, crisps, and fizzy drinks with little
fresh fruit and vegetables suggests they are laying down potential
''time bombs'' for the future, leading to the onset of irreversible
thinning of the bones, or osteoporosis, with stress fractures, crushed
vertebrae and endless pain.
The report highlights another problem: the lack of exercise undertaken
by young women. Yet regular exercise is essential for the development
and maintenance of bone mass.
A small minority of the population, the professional female athlete
and dancer, is at risk of fragile bone disease for the opposite reason:
they exercise too much and suffer from stress fractures.
''The big problem among the majority of young women is not that they
are over-exercising but not exercising enough,'' says Dr McLellan.
Another group at risk are those young women who diet excessively and
have eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. Such is the concern
among health professionals about the growing risk of osteoporosis in
young women that a conference will take place on September 25 in London
to discuss ways of tackling the problem. It is being organised by the
National Osteoporosis Society.
Linda Edwards, director of the NOS, says: ''Young women seemingly at
the peak of fitness may, in fact, have fragile bones equivalent to that
of a 60-year-old woman. Unless they protect their bones from
osteoporosis they run the risk of many years of pain and fractures in
later life.''
In severe cases, excessive exercise and low body-weight can lead to
the complete loss of periods and fit young women in their 20s and 30s
start developing osteoporosis. The problem is international. New
research from America shows that while adults are mostly getting enough
calcium, adolescent girls are receiving too little.
The diet cola generation of teenage girls runs the risk of becoming
tomorrow's stooped old women with brittle bones, says Dr Velimir
Matkovic, from Ohio University, an expert on mineral metabolism.
Weight-conscious girls who cut out milk and bread are depriving
themselves of calcium when their bodies need it most. Instead of
switching to skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, which have similar calcium
contents to whole milk, many youngsters were drinking synthetically
sweetened fizzy drinks. Yet milk and bread, both cheap and easily
available, are rich sources of calcium, vital for building strong bones.
The Department of Health recommends a daily intake of 625mg for girls
aged 11-14. Yet in a study of 60 11-year-olds over one third were found
to have less than 600mg of calcium per day.
Thinning bones offer no early warning signs for typical teenage girls
like Fiona. But the good news is that it's preventable. All a youngster
needs to protect her bones, is: a pint of milk, or a carton of yoghurt,
or two ounces of cheese daily.

William Russell finds a classy thriller, a heartwarming love story, an
insight into incest, and a tragic masterpiece at cinemas this week
NOT half as clever as it thinks it is, perhaps, but Bryan Singer's The
Usual Suspects is, nevertheless, one of the best thrillers in years with
a B-list cast of stars giving A-list performances. The problem, the
usual one with such stories, is that spotting the murderer, in this case
also the mysterious Mister Big, is merely a case of common sense.
Anyone who reads detective fiction will have no difficulty. The film,
in any case, hints at the truth because what we are seeing is not a
story unfolding as it happens, although the illusion is given that it
is, but a story someone is telling somebody else. Is it true? Is it
false? As one of the characters says -- ''The greatest trick the Devil
ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist'' -- a line, you
will recall, from a prose poem by Baudelaire.
Christopher McQuarrie's plot flits from the present to the past and
back again, leaving the audience bewildered, bemused and bedazzled. It
is a condition compounded by Singer whose style is baroque and flashy.
At the end all is explained. The film caters for the sort of people who
do crosswords and the kind who just like lots of killings because, as
well as having an intelligent script, it is very violent in the modern
manner.
A cargo ship explodes in San Pedro harbour, California, leaving 27
dead and two survivors, a badly burnt man in hospital who babbles about
a master criminal devil -- a Hungarian called Keyzer Soze -- and a lame,
small-time con man, ''Verbal'' Kint (Kevin Spacey). Kint is interrogated
by a US customs agent, Dave Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri). Kujan is
convinced the ship was being used to smuggle drugs and that the
mastermind, Soze, was former cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne).
Keaton and Kint, had been arrested some weeks earlier suspected of
organising a truck hijack in New York and the others in the line-up --
Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro, and Kevin Pollack, all excellent --
are among those who died in the ship explosion. Pete Postlethwaite,
sounding like Peter Sellers in The Millionairess, as a mysterious lawyer
called Kobayashi and employed by Soze, and Suzy Amis as Keaton's lawyer
girlfriend complicate matters further.
This is one of those rare films to see twice. The condundrum may have
been solved, but there is pleasure in watching how it -- and you -- are
set up, because it is giving nothing away. This is a set-up.
Romantic comedy is difficult these days to bring off. But Jon
Turteltaub's funny, sentimental and heartwarming film, While You Were
Sleeping, does the trick perfectly.
Lucy Moderatz (the enchanting Sandra Bullock) is a single girl, an
orphan, who works in a ticket booth on the Chicago elevated railway and
dreams of seeing the world. She has fallen in love with one of her
regular customers, a dishy but snotty lawyer called Peter Callaghan
(Peter Gallagher), who has not noticed her existence.
Over Christmas -- because she has no family she has been persuaded to
work -- he is mugged, falls from the platform on to the line and is
rescued from the path of an oncoming train by Lucy. He is taken to
hospital in a coma where Lucy is mistaken for his fiancee, a pretence
she has, for reasons that do not matter, to keep up when his family
arrive at his bedside.
Peter's brother Jack (Bill Pullman) is, however, puzzled by Lucy. Why
have they not heard of her. She is not Peter's type. But she is Jack's
type. What will happen when Peter wakes up? Will he blow the gaff? Will
he marry Lucy? Will Jack reveal he loves her? It is all very
far-fetched, but Daniel G Sullivan and Frederic Lebow's script manages
to provide plausible reasons for Lucy's deception. The film is pure
pleasure from start to finish.
Pullman and Bullock play off one another perfectly, while Glynis
Johns, as Grandma Callaghan, Peter Boyle as Father Callaghan, Nicole
Mercurio as Mother Callaghan, and Jack Warden as Saul, the Jewish
widower next door and old family friend who spots Lucy's deception early
on, provide the kind of immaculate comic support one used to get in the
great days of Capra.
Johns, twinkling brightly away, gets some cracking lines, which I
won't spoil by quoting, but look out for the way she refuses another
drink. You will hear it used again and again.
A dark comic tale about incest, Spanking the Monkey directed by David
O Russell delivers a body blow to the wholesome all-American family.
Incest is a tricky subject, but Russell, who also wrote the film,
handles it with tact, insight, and sympathy.
Jeremy Davies is Ray, a young medical student forced by his cheapskate
philandering father to spend a summer looking after his mother, Alberta
Watson, who is confined to bed with a broken leg. He is on heat -- the
title refers to a pastime young men indulge in -- and his possessive
mother, irked because he has met a nice girl, asserts her control over
him with disastrous results. The film, which is very funny, ends without
providing any answers to the terrible situation mother and son are in.
Nikita Mikhalkov's Burnt by the Sun was one of the highlights of the
Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival, which closed on Sunday. I called it a
masterpiece then, and I stand by the description. Set in 1936 it deals
with the events of a summer's day on the dacha belonging to a Hero of
the Revolution, played by Mikhalkov, which begins happily and ends in
tragedy as the reasons for the visit by the unexpected guest, Oleg
Menchikov, are revealed.

WILLIAM RUSSELL meets actor Bill Pullman whose latest romantic role
looks set to finally make him a household name
This is a test case of whether he can carry a film
YOU know the face, but the name? It is thingummyjig, you know, the one
who was in that movie playing somebody or other, can't somehow remember
his name, but it is on the tip of my tongue.
The history of cinema is littered with actors whose careers are spent
playing the hero's best friend who is usually destined to die in the
second-last reel, or the man who does not get the girl but is only there
so that she can throw him over for the hero, but we never know their
names.
This week, however, something unusual is about to happen. Old
Wotsisname will finally get the girl. In the comedy, While You Were
Sleeping, the female lead, Sandra Bullock, ends up not with the flashily
handsome Peter Gallagher but with his brother played by the aforesaid
Wotsisname.
A ticket clerk on the Chicago underground, Lucy Moderatz (Bullock) has
fallen for one of her regulars, a smart lawyer, Peter Callaghan
(Gallagher). After he is mugged, she rescues him, and at the hospital is
mistaken by his family for his fiancee. Wotsisname plays Gallagher's
brother, Jack, who soon realises, as does Lucy, that they were meant for
each other. Naturally there are complications. So what is Wotsisname
called?
The answer -- Bill Pullman. Remember him? He was the guy Meg Ryan,
showing remarkable lack of good sense, threw over for Tom Hanks in
Sleepless in Seattle. In Sommersby, the remake of The Return of Martin
Guerre, Jodie Foster's civil war widow was doing nicely, thank you, with
Pullman as manager of her Deep South estate until Richard Gere came back
from the battlefield claiming to be her missing husband. She, too,
ditched safety for danger.
In the thriller Malice he was the college professor who lost Nicole
Kidman to Alec Baldwin, although that was maybe no bad thing as Kidman
was not what she seemed, while in that superb film noir, The Last
Seduction, he played the husband the devious Linda Fiorentino trampled
into the ground.
Part of Pullman's problem is that, like Jeff Daniels, another
Wotsisname, he boasts a nice, clean-cut, handsome appearance without
actually being terribly sexy. He did get top billing playing a ghost
hunter in Casper, the frenetic comedy about the friendly ghost, released
this summer, but that was a children's film and his role as a bumbling
Dad was hardly likely to transform him from amiable, middle-aged nerd
into the new Keanu Reeves. While You Were Sleeping, however, is another
matter. It is a romantic comedy in which he gets the girl who drove the
bus in Speed alongside that teen-love object, Keanu.
Pullman's misfortune as far as Hollywood stardom is concerned is
arguably that his first big hit, his first film in fact, was Ruthless
People made in 1986. He played possibly the most stupid person on the
face of the earth, trying to relieve kidnapper Judge Rheinhold of ransom
cash in full view of hundreds of armed cops.
The role created a celluloid persona for him which his next film, Mel
Brooks's witless comedy, Spaceballs, did nothing to alter. Loads of work
followed, but he was repeatedly cast as a fall guy. Appearing with
Bullock is a test case because, after Speed, her career is on overdrive.
Together they could make box-office magic.
Pullman is 41, was born in Hornell, New Jersey, and set out to be a
builder. It was while he was at technical college that he became
interested in acting and switched courses, getting a bachelor's degree
in theatre arts. After that he studied directing at the University of
Massachusetts and landed a job at the University of Montana where he
taught theatre. By the age of 27 he was head of Montana's theatre
department.
Two years later he moved to New York to try the real thing, worked in
fringe theatre, at the Lincoln Centre and at the Folger Theatre in
Washington DC, building up a solid reputation for being a sound actor.
He was critically applauded for his role opposite Kathy Bates in an
off-Broadway revival of Sam Shepard's The Curse of the Starving Class,
and there he might have remained, a shining light of the fringe. But in
1985 he moved to Los Angeles. California is now his home.
A plaid shirt, sober, solid sort of a bloke, he is married to the
modern ballet dancer Tamara Hurwitz, and they have three children. His
hobby is growing trees. You name it -- cherry trees, apple trees, jojoba
trees -- Bill plants them, Bill nurtures them. ''There is something very
spiritual about fruit to me, it's like a faith planting something that
is going to bear something, that goes through your body,'' he told one
interviewer. He is a Californian New Age male.
So where does he go from here? His next screen role is as the
President of the United States in a science-fiction movie to be directed
by Roland Emmerich, who made Stargate. ''He's the President we have all
been waiting for,'' according to Pullman. Maybe. But is Pullman the star
we have been waiting for, because it is some time since a new male lead
emerged. Will it be Bill Pullman? Watch this space. Or will it be a case
of once a Wostisname, always one?

THE Baldwin brothers are a Hollywood phenomenon, four of them, all
actors. Alec, the eldest, was first on the scene and then suddenly he
was not alone, writes WILLIAM RUSSELL. Not that the brothers are blurred
carbon copies of each other. They have very distinct personalities.
Stephen, the next in line, is currently playing a psychopathic thug in
The Usual Suspects, but he could as easily have been America's second
Mario Lanza or its first Placido Domingo.
Just why these sons of a Long Island school teacher should have opted
for the stage is a mystery -- at least as far as Stephen is concerned.
So far laid back he is almost horizontal, he insisted it had seemed the
thing to do. The laid-back state, I suggest was due to jet lag, then
realised he had not come from America that day but from London where he
had been filming.
He said it was ''interview lag''.
Stephen Balwdin was 19 when he embarked on his acting career and has
done all the things struggling actors do, like making pizza on 80th
Street off Broadway. His big break came with a film called The Beast,
his first line was in a TV sit-com called Kate and Allie starring
Michael J Fox in which he played a high school jock who uttered the
immortal words -- ''Is this an open book test?'' He said he would never
forget the line.
But acting might not have grabbed him. He sang as a schoolboy,
appearing in high school productions of shows like Godspell, and won a
scholarship to the Juillard School of Music. ''I figured I had to get
serious or change direction,'' he said. ''I had had a lot of success
singing opera but it became very businesslike. I did not have the
discipline.''
He trained for a year at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New
York, got a manager and an agent, and his acting career was launched.
Will the four Baldwin brothers ever appear together? It would depend on
the right project coming along, he said.
In the meantime he is making a film in London, Crimetime, which will
reunite him with one of his Suspects co-stars, the British actor Pete
Postlethwaite. Crimetime is about an actor who lands a role in a TV
re-enactment about a serial killer, how the real serial killer
(Postlethwaite) identifies with the fame this brings, and how the actor
becomes obsessed with the idea of killing.
As for being part of a theatrical dynasty like the Barrymores, he said
the brothers are all just plugging away. ''You never know where you are
going next in this profession'' he added. ''I am a gipsy. It is the life
I have chosen.''

Tbilisi
WITHIN a day of surviving an assassination attempt, Georgian leader
Eduard Shevardnadze said he would run for president in November.
''God is with us, people are with us, the world is with us, and we
will win,'' the defiant 67-year-old former Soviet Foreign Minister told
4000 supporters in the capital, Tbilisi.
Shevardnadze, likely to be a strong candidate for the post, looked fit
although the cuts he sustained to his face in yesterday's car bomb
attack were still visible.
Hundreds of riot police stood guard at the rally and marksmen took up
positions on buildings in the capital.
Shevardnadze, who was on his way to sign a new constitution awarding
the future president strong powers, was leaving the inner courtyard of
the Georgian Parliament when a four-wheel-drive vehicle exploded nearby.
He was taken to hospital but released after treatment for minor
injuries.
''The aim was to get rid of one presidential candidate and disrupt the
pre-election campaign,'' he told the rally.
Earlier, officials said they had arrested 10 armed men who had plans
of Parliament and of Shevardnadze's residence.
Security Minister Igor Georgadze told an extraordinary session of
Parliament that his forces had detained the men, but MPs said it was too
little, too late.
Many blamed Georgadze for surging crime and a wave of political
terrorism. Some MPs want to bring in a state of emergency, at least in
the capital.
Georgadze said that only further investigation would show whether the
group arrested was linked to the assassination attempt.--Reuter/AP.

Srinagar
THE wife and girlfriend of two Britons held captive in Kashmir today
broke their silence to welcome proof that the hostages are alive.
The separatist Al-Faran group holding Keith Mangan and Paul Wells
yesterday gave Indian officials answers to detailed personal questions
which only the Britons could provide.
Similar answers were provided for the other hostages, American Donald
Hutchings and German Dirk Hasert.
A spokesman at the British High Commission in Delhi said the answers
were the first proof the hostages were alive since a photograph taken 12
days ago.
In their first public comment since the early days of the crisis, now
in its ninth week, Julie Mangan, Jane Hutchings, Anna-Katrin Hasert and
Mr Wells' girlfriend Catherine Moseley said: ''We, the relatives of Don,
Dirk, Keith, and Paul, welcome the news that all four are alive and
well.
''We're grateful to Al-Faran for this humanitarian gesture. It's
greatly relieved and comforted us.
''We now look forward to the speedy release of our loved ones.''
The four women are all currently staying at the High Commission in
Delhi.
The High Commission spokesman said of the women: ''They're still
keeping their heads down, but they felt that this would be something
they would want put out.''
The questions answered by the kidnappers were drawn up by the men's
relatives and included such details as family birthdays.
The kidnappers, who received the questions through an intermediary in
the Kashmiri capital Srinagar, used a radio supplied by the Indian
government to read out the hostages' answers, speaking on a special
frequency.
The news comes two days after the kidnappers allowed Indian
negotiators to talk to Mr Hutchings by radio -- the first direct contact
with the hostages.
Fears had been raised after repeated death threats and the murder of
Norwegian hostage Hans Ostroe, but Mr Hutchings said all four were in
good health.
''The mood is one of very cautious optimism,'' said an official with
the government of Jammu and Kashmir state.
''It is a matter of concern that the kidnappers are still holding the
hostages, but we are satisfied the abductors have not harmed the men
despite the killing of the Norwegian.''
India has refused to free the 15 militants whose release Al-Faran is
demanding.
Negotiators are pinning hopes on a deal which would involve the
release of the captive tourists as well as a number of jailed
separatists who might have been freed under the government's regular
review of their status.
''We must have unending patience and cannot get provoked,'' one
official said.
''We can hardly feel happy before the hostages come back and there can
always be a last-minute hitch,'' he added, ''but we are satisfied
Al-Faran is not playing tricks and it is a matter of some satisfaction
that the hostages are safe.''

IF anyone in this series was going to gang his or her ain gait, it was
Dick Gaughan. And if anyone was guaranteed to frighten the tourists, it
was the boay fae Leith. Frightened? Grey-haired wifies were vacating the
front row after one song. It was strong stuff, and so it (and the
exodus) continued: a bitter Flooers o' the Forest; Farewell to Sicily
taken at a stolid slow march, with his guitar in the lone piper role,
and in the face of much continental discussion; a fierce Erin Go Bragh
and an even fiercer No Gods.
The problem for the visitors was, they'd never heard anything like
this, or the savage put-downs of Bonnie Prince Charlie. The problem for
this native was, a stark, stunning encore of MacCrimman's Lament aside,
it was business as usual. I bow to no-one in my admiration for Gaughan's
performing power, be it rant, Burns song or ballad. But this, surely,
was an opportunity missed. Couldn't some pressure -- even pounds -- have
been applied to persuade him to raid Messrs Greig and Duncan's good
books and come up with some new arrangements? Few, if any, could do a
better job.

Moscow
POOR Russian flying maps may have contributed to the deaths of three
British air enthusiasts in a light aircraft crash near Moscow, it
emerged today.
Russell Bessey, David Stephens, and Anthony Naylor were killed along
with their Russian pilot when their single-engined four-seater YAK-18T
plane crashed in bad weather 25 miles south-west of the Russian capital.
Mr Stephens, 38, an aviation journalist from Pershore, Hereford and
Worcester; Mr Bessey, 37, from Woking, Surrey; and Mr Naylor, 30, from
West Yorkshire, were with a group of 39 aviation enthusiasts who had
flown out for the Moscow air show and were visiting the city's
Myatchkovo airport.
Travel agent George Pick, who organised the trip, said they were being
taken on a scenic flight by the airport chief, a senior colonel, when
the accident happened on Monday.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: ''They were hit by a severe weather
front which may have disorientated the pilot. That's something for the
investigators to find out.
''Another group had made a similar flight 30 minutes before and had
reported that all was well. It looks like the weather more than anything
caused the accident.''
Peter March, contributing editor to Air World International, said he
had heard that the plane had diverted to another airport and had hit
power lines as it tried to land.
''The pilot might have been flying lower than he should have been and
not been familiar with the area,'' he said.
''Russian flying maps are very, very inadequate. They have never
wanted to issue very detailed maps from a security point of view. Pilots
tend to use road maps. In Britain we have an annually updated flying
map.''
Ironically he had discussed the issue with Mr Stephens at the air show
over the previous two days, he said.
Mr March said the YAK-18T would have been no more than three years old
and was a very reliable plane. He understood the pilot was chairman of
Russia's Federation of Light Aviation, the Equivalent of the Royal Aero
Club.
Mr Pick, managing director of Leicester-based George Pick Travel and
himself an aviation enthusiast, said he had also been told the plane had
hit power cables.
He thought it was likely that the pilot would have diverted in order
to land as soon as possible after the bad weather hit.
But he added: ''He had 30 years of experience and had been head of the
airport for years. A person of that nature would know his area like the
back of his hand.''
Mr Pick said he would have had no worries about safety.
''All pilots in Russia are professionals. There are no amateurs,'' he
said, and added that he had flown in the YAK-18T before and considered
it safe.
Mr Stephens, a single man, was a freelance reporter and photographer
who had been covering the air show for Wingspan magazine.
Alan Forberg, editor and publisher of the monthly magazine, said: ''I
am in a state of shock over this and trying to digest it.
''I know he was very well thought of on the air show circuit and he
loved the aviation scene. I don't know what we will do without him.''
The remaining 36 members of the group are due to fly back to Britain
on Tuesday.

THE peerless wind band from the Chamber Orchestra of Europe yesterday
turned out a set of performances that were not only, in their own right,
an utter joy to hear, but also provided the exact antidote required to
the black nihilism generated the night before by the grotesque Zimmerman
Requiem.
The COE band bring new meaning to the word ensemble. Under direction
of Scots oboist Douglas Boyd, they don't just play together, they play
as one. Every nuance is meticulously crafted and shaped, without the
results ever sounding formalised. The crisp, bracing, and dazzlingly
articulate playing in Franz Krommer's Octet Partita leapt off the page
like an improvisation.
Where the Krommer sparkled, Dvorak's Serenade, in the second half of
the concert, brimmed with warmth. This was one of the classiest wind
band performances I have heard: robust, stylish, quicksilver playing,
and a performance (with the exception of a series of fluffs from the
principal horn) that was just about as flawless as you could expect.
But the core of this exceptional concert -- and a real revelation --
was the COE's extraordinary performance of Mozart's Serenade in D Minor.
The Serenade, traditionally, was a piece that might be expected to
function, in one or another, as background music. The mixture of
darkness and light, of wit and solemnity, that the COE revealed in the
first movement of this one, illuminated, as much as in any of the
recognised great works, what could happen when Mozart unleashed his
genius.
Similarly with the finale, where a quiet, stealthy, darkish opening
turned effortlessly, and by turns, into a strutting march, a warm
lyrical section with a soaring melody on clarinet, a return to
wistfulness, and an abrupt dispersal of the clouds in an ebullient
close. A masterly performance of an astonishing piece.

<HEADLINE>Indians block Delta Force. American rescue mission obstructed as relatives hail news from hostages.</HEADLINE>

INDIAN government authorities are blocking a rescue mission by the US
Army's Delta Force -- the American SAS -- to free four Western hostages
held by an alleged terrorist group in Kashmir, according to intelligence
sources.
A team from the elite commando unit arrived secretly in northern India
earlier this week to prepare for a smash-and-grab raid against the
mysterious and previously unknown Al-Faran militants who have been
holding Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, an American, and a German
for nine weeks.
However the US troopers' weapons and equipment were impounded by
Indian Customs officials on arrival, and it is understood that it took
the US State Department almost 24 hours to secure their release.
The red-tape wrangle continued when the Delta Force commander
requested detailed maps of the mountainous region where the four
Westerners are believed to be in captivity. The Americans were informed
that no such maps existed, as the area had never been surveyed in
detail.
When the US commander then produced high-altitude photographs of the
area taken by the Indian air force two years ago, the bureaucratic
barricades came down once more.
An inquiry has been launched into what the Indians describe as a
breach of their national security. Meanwhile, the Delta Force team is
still understood to be confined to a military airbase.
A source said yesterday: ''It is becoming increasingly clear that the
Indians do not want a quick-fix solution to the hostage crisis. The
latest episode has all the makings of a major diplomatic incident, but
it is unlikely to come to a public row between governments, given the
clandestine nature of the proposed operation.''
The Herald revealed exclusively last week that there is a growing
suspicion among Western intelligence agencies that Al-Faran may be part
of an Indian ''dirty tricks'' plot to discredit Kashmir militant groups
in the run-up to provincial elections in Jammu-Kashmir in November.
The other main separatist factions fighting for independence from
India are armed and funded by Pakistan. All of these have denounced
Al-Faran's hostage taking and its cold-blooded beheading of a Norwegian
captive two weeks ago.
British sources say Al-Faran may be led by Indian special forces or
Afghan mercenaries. Other members of the band may not even know who
their real paymasters are.
Concern is also growing that if Western commandos intervene in an
attempted rescue, the four remaining hostages will be killed out of
hand.
''Another alternative would be an Indian operation to eliminate the
entire group, including its own men and the hostages, to destroy any
evidence of Indian government collusion,'' a source added.
The Indian secret service, which is trained by Israel's Mossad, set up
a similar bogus terrorist organisation called Al Fatah in 1971 to
discredit Islamic separatists. That group, which has since ceased to
exist, hijacked an Indian airliner and blew it up on the runway at
Lahore.

NICHOLAS POWELL writes of mixed reactions to the Scottish theme at the
Douarnenez cinema festival
THE biggest festival of Scottish film, bringing together not only some
13,000 film buffs but also writers, directors and producers, politicians
and musicians such as SNP MP for Perth, Roseanna Cunningham, and the
Scottish Gas pipe band, has just been held -- abroad.
After Aborigines and the Irish, the Britanny port of Douarnenez,
devoted the theme of its annual summer cinema festival to the Scots.
Taking in some 50 Scottish films, debates, concerts, and small hours
of partying, the 18th Douarnenez Festival included home-made products
such as Peter Capaldi's Franz Kaska, It's A Wonderful Life, Danny
Boyle's Shallow Grave of 1994 (a great success in Paris last winter),
and In Cuba They're Still Dancing, Richard Downs's documentary about
rumba-loving socialist Agnes McLean.
But it also took in spray-on Scottish themes and big US finance, such
as Highlander, Rob Roy, and David Leland's The Big Man, based on the
novel by William McIlvanney.
Breton and French reactions were varied. Some were irritated by the
screening of well-worn commercial successes. The selection of Gaelic
films also got a mixed reception. Eric Tanguy, a commentator from the
Breton-speaking radio Bro Gwened enthused that Douglas McKinnon's An
Sealladh (The Vision) of 1993, a tale of crofters hit by potato blight
and Mike Alexander's Mairi Mhor of 1994, about the Skye-born singer and
political activist Mary Macpherson, corresponded to his Picture of
Scotland. But the critic from Le Monde, Christian Zimmer and some other
cinemagoers I spoke to, were actually repelled by the ''self-conscious
picture-postcard prettiness'' of so much Highland scenery.
Christian Zimmer was deeply impressed, on the other hand, by Peter
Watkins's Culloden of 1964 and The Fridge, a 20-minute short of
unremitting verbal and physical violence and pathetic tenderness, made
this year by Peter Mulan and produced by Frances Higson.
Judging by the applause, the public also appreciated David Halliday's
film about Gaelic song, Uamh an oir (Cave of Gold). Currently hunting
for European finance to make films about Celtic myths and legends, David
Halliday said he encountered a demand for similar treatment of Breton
songs in Douarnenez.
The festival saw the European premiere of Being Human, Bill Forsyth's
latest film starring Robin Williams. Warner Brothers, who spent $30m
making it, gave Being Human no promotion in the States and only released
it this year in Britain on video.
''They didn't release it. They left a studio door open and let it
escape,'' said Forsyth, who denies having gone AWOL in Hollywood.
''People ask when I'm coming back to Scotland. The truth is, I've
never been away. I went to Hollywood feeling I was going to rob a bank.
But my next film will be a UK or European production,'' said Forsyth,
who, seriously demoralised by the experience of Being Human, refused to
reveal what his plans are for the future.
As a breakfast-time debate with Forsyth, McIlvanney exposed his
theories of fundamental, Machiavellian division between Scotland's
working class and her ''bourgeoisie''. And on her first visit to
Britanny, Roseanna Cunningham, debating politics with Labour's George
Kerevan, said she was struck by the difference.
''I had felt Britanny would be like Scotland. But people are much less
categorical about nationalism, which is expressed not politically but
culturally, here.''
Two festivals of Scottish film are planned for the next few months in
Hungary and Poland, Kevin Cowle of the Scottish Film Council announced
in Douarnenez.

IN Bernhard Paumgartner's time, the Salzburg Camerata was the dullest
orchestra in Europe. Today, with a new generation of players, it seems
not much better, though at least it possesses a splendid figurehead in
the person of its 90-year-old conductor, Sandor Vegh.
Though his beat amounts to little more than an outstretched arm and a
waggle of the fingers, and though, from his seated position, much of
what he does must be no more communicative than what Klemperer once did,
he contrives to be the dynamo that controls such energy as the orchestra
produces.
What he is best at, however, is turning a Schubertian phrase, and
there were many such niceties in his conducting of the second and third
symphonies last night. True, you could not fail to wish he had woodwind
players more eloquent than, in particular, the first oboe, who may have
been off-form, though the clarinet at least rose to his solo in the slow
movement of the third symphony.
It did seem a pity, however, that two such similar symphonies were
included in the same programme, and in such thick-toned performances.
Haydn's 103rd, in comparison, proved much more luminous, with bassoons
properly prominent in the opening bars, and a real sense of line among
the strings.
The slow movement, admittedly, sounded more like an adagio than the
andante Haydn called for, but there was no doubt about its
expressiveness.
At the age of 90, you felt, the conductor was entitled to treat the
music lingeringly and lovingly.

Beijing
BEIJING'S Olympic Stadium rose en masse tonight to sing Auld Lang
Syne. In an emotional rendering of the Scots song, internationally
famous opera star Yao Hong had 30,000 women -- and a few men -- on their
feet singing alongside her.
All the small Scottish contingent could do was shed a tear at the
impact of the song at the end of a spectacular display of Chinese music
and dance by around 2000 performers.
The anthem was part of a glittering gala opening ceremony for the
United Nations Women's Forum, which starts tomorrow in earnest.
The ceremony allowed leading Chinese and UN dignitaries to extend an
official welcome to the women who have travelled from every country in
the world to do business in China's capital. Their business is to
persuade, lobby, and influence the outcome of the UN Fourth World
Conference on Women, which starts on Monday.
The 20,000 white doves released as Auld Lang Syne was sung will be
needed as a sign of peace, adding to the equality and development that
the women want action on.
The forum is a preliminary event for non-governmental organisations to
state their case and have their concerns integrated in the final
document produced by the Fourth World Conference. Issues of poverty,
violence, the girl child, and abortion are among the many which will be
the subject of intense scrutiny.
President of the All China Women's Federation, Chen Muhua -- who is
also vice-chair of the standing committee of China's National People's
Congress -- said the forum and the Fourth World Conference were China's
contribution to women and the world.
Convenor of the NGO forum, Khunying Supatra Masdit, said it had taken
two years to organise the event. ''We have marched a long way forward in
those two years. Now we expect action for a better world for all.''

FORMIDABLE. Formidable. Say it in French. Say it in English. Shout it
from the rooftops. This is breathtaking theatre, a visceral, brutal,
haunting, energising exploration by Odeon-Theatre de L'Europe of French
playwright Bernard-Marie Koltes's text. Two strangers cross paths in a
wasteground and one proposes a transaction to the other. The dealer
never clarifies what's on offer and the client never confirms an
interest; in the verbal badinage which follows Koltes allegorises states
of need and longing, suspicion and fear, dreadful cruelty. It is about
the way men deal with one another rather than any mythical deal.
Director Patrice Chereau, who also plays the dealer, does not recreate
a suitable space, he takes us to it, taking over the musty Drill Hall
and putting the initial proposed start time back an hour to nine
o'clock, to dusk, a moody time redolent with menace, when the play is
set. In fact the windows are blacked and the space is artificially lit
but the decision enhances the otherworldly mood.
The piece is a two-hander, the client played by Pascal Greggory, but
there is no doubt that what we are watching is not a dialogue but a
duel, with the audience arranged in two facing banks of seating the
gladiatorial symbolism of the performance cannot be ignored. During two
pauses following climactic moments Chereau and Greggory sit down among
us, sip water and flex muscles, boxers retiring to the ringside.
Chereau's direction is masterly, exercising consummate command of
space, the actors treading every available square inch as they range
around. The client constantly loops away from the dealer, disgusted by
his illicit air, yet always returns, lured not by the enigma of what is
on offer but by a curiosity as to how the dealer will attempt to induce
him, thrilling to the gratification of refusing these offers, that of
''letting you discover all the different ways there are of saying no''.
Koltes simultaneously grapples with abstract and fundamental themes,
with the ever-present chill of death in the air; metaphysical allusions
are rooted in mundane imagery, of waiters totting up bills, fat women
squeezing through tables in restaurants, and, again and again, of farm
animals, with constant comparisons between man and beast.
Stunningly performed, the rapturous applause for this outstanding
production was well deserved.

New York
THE New Testament will receive an overhaul next month with a new
English translation eliminating references to God the Father, turning
the Son of Man into ''the human one'', and removing accusations that
Jews killed Christ.
The new translation says children should not ''obey'' their parents
but heed them. Wives are no longer ''subject'' to their husbands but
committed to them. ''Darkness'' is no longer equated with evil because
of racist overtones and the Lord's Prayer now begins: ''Our
Father-Mother in heaven . . . ''
References to the right hand of God are also deleted, eliminating
possible embarrassment to left-handed people. It now becomes God's
mighty hand.
The translation takes pains to cut the number of times God is referred
to as Lord because lords as a ruling group are passe.
''The Lord God doesn't cut it these days because we don't have
lords,'' said Susan Thistlethwaite, one of six editors. ''I thought of
using the phrase 'The One to Whom You Swear Allegiance', but frankly
that was awkward. We often use the phrase 'Most High', because it is
more accurate.''
The editors of The New Testament and Psalms: An Inclusive Version deny
that they have spent the last five years producing a ''politically
correct'' Bible, but admit that a legion of traditionists are waiting to
''cast the first stone'' and begin one of the biggest biblical debates
in years.
Some critics have already charged that the editors have censored the
Bible in order to order to make it fit political trends.
However Thistlethwaite says: ''I think political correctness is a
perjorative term which is used by people who want the Bible to produce
obedience, not thoughtfulness.''--Reuter.

Defence Correspondent Ian Bruce outlines the strategic consequences of
Nato's new role.
THE United Nations came abruptly of age in the pre-dawn darkness of
Bosnia yesterday as waves of Nato fighter-bombers and a deluge of French
and British artillery shells transformed its role in that war-weary land
from feeble and failed peace-keeper to that of powerful peace-enforcer.
The strikes were long overdue in a country which has so far endured
three years of genocidal atrocity and the deaths of more than 200,000 of
its people. True to the nature of all civil conflicts, most of the
victims have been civilians with no direct involvement in the issues
which fanned the flames of ethnic hatred in the first place.
The attacking bombers have finally blasted open the first genuine
window of opportunity for a peaceful settlement of the crisis and, if
the protagonists have to be driven to the negotiating table at gunpoint,
at least they will go there with the clear understanding that no further
aggression will be tolerated.
Previous UN efforts, although well-meaning, have created a legacy of
broken promises piled almost as deeply as the broken bodies left in
their wake. This time, a definite line has been drawn. It may be
cattle-prod diplomacy but, if it works, then it will have been
justified.
The trick now is for the UN, with Nato as its sword arm, to keeps its
nerve and impose its will with unswerving resolution. The slightest
deviation from that track would lay the peace process open once more to
the men of violence on all sides.
There can be no turning back and no return to the ineffectual
brokering of a deal which was never going to be achieved. Nor can there
be the slightest hesitation in the ordering of further air raids or
artillery bombardments. The days of pussy-footing UN bureaucrats in New
York calling off the shots in the war zone must be consigned to history.
Nato is now in the military driving seat and that is as it should be
in the prevailing circumstances. It is an organisation trained,
equipped, and ready for decisive action. The time for UN diplomacy will
come when the warring sides realise that ethnic gun law has been
overtaken by events and overwhelming air power.
With perfect hindsight, former Canadian UN Commander in Sarajevo
Genera Lewis Mackenzie may yet be proved right. He maintained for the
start that the commitment of a single, division-sized force of western
troops -- about 15,000 men -- properly equipped with artillery and
backed by political will, might have prevented the outbreak of war in
1992.
A well-intentioned but innately naive UN instead sent in contingents
of ill-equipped troops from countries around the globe. Over the span of
the conflict, these have included a battalion of 400 Bangladeshi
infantry with fewer than 100 rifles between them, a Nigerian battalion
which was not quite sure of where it was, never mind why, and a Russian
unit which took to looting local inhabitants because its men had not
been paid for two months.
The Serbs have been hurt, physically and psychologically, but their
military machine has not yet been crippled beyond repair. In the spirit
of Balkan blood-feud, they will almost inevitably try for some
face-saving swipe at UN forces on the ground. When it comes, it must be
stamped on ruthlessly. The Serbs understand strength. They respect
nothing else.
Their leadership in Pale is already paranoid after the crushing defeat
of Serb forces by the Croats in the Krajina a few weeks ago and the
growing strength and military capability of the Bosnian government army.
They are over-stretched everywhere and feeling vulnerable. That makes
them truly dangerous.
The other danger is that, given the public split between their
military and political leadership, General Ratko Mladic, the architect
of ethnic cleansing, may seize his chance to attempt a coup and lead his
people to a final showdown with Nato which they would inevitably lose.
Before the dust of the bomb-bursts around the safe areas settles, it
must be made abundantly clear to both Muslims and Croats that Nato has
not launched its own attacks to pave the way for local ground offensives
against the beleaguered Serbs.
Harsh experience dictates that the UN must adapt rapidly to a policy
of heavy but even-handed justice. Any attempt by the other factions to
take military advantage of the air strikes would have to be met by
similar treatment.
With the arrival of the Anglo-French Rapid Reaction Force and the
political will to carry out co-ordinated, systematic and punishing
raids, the peace making potential has improved greatly. The withdrawal
of all but a couple of dozen potential UN hostages from the main
flashpoints also helps to narrow Serb options for retaliation.
But winter is approaching, and winter comes hard and fast in the
central highlands of Bosnia. The remaining UN garrisons will then be
isolated to a great extent and dependent on airlifts of ammunition and
supplies. The French and British gun batteries dug in on Mount Igman and
dominating the approaches to Sarajevo with their firepower may be left
particularly vulnerable. Their guns sent more than 600 shells crashing
down on Serb positions in only a few hours yesterday.
Artillery by its nature devours huge quantities of ammunition in a
protracted battle. The French heavy guns, self-propelled 155mm
howitzers, can fire up to 100 rounds an hour. The two batteries of
British light 105mm field guns backing them up can fire six shells a
minute.
When cloud and snow restrict aerial cover and re-supply, the gunners
manning positions above the besieged city will have their lifeline
reduced to a couple of vulnerable roads snaking through mountain passes
all the way back to the Croatian coast.
A smart Serb commander might bide his time. The heavy snows are less
than a month away. Then, if he drew the Allied batteries into a
protracted firefight, accepting that he would sustain heavy losses in
the process, he could deplete their ammunition within a day or two and
leave them exposed to infantry assault.
Protection of the vital roads would be an almost impossible task. It
would occupy all of the men of the RRF at the very least. The worst case
scenario drawn up by Nato planners earlier this year called for the
commitment of up to 20,000 additional ground troops to guarantee the
integrity of the routes through to next spring.
The Serbs may also have relearned painfully a fundamental lesson for
the conduct of offensive operations in their own country. Fixed
artillery positions are sitting ducks for Nato warplanes or
counter-battery fire from UN guns.
Since the Serbs have only a handful of out-classed ex-Soviet MiG 21
fighters, they are incapable of mounting a serious challenge in the air.
They are also up against Nato troops equipped with locating radar. These
devices plot the trajectory of incoming shell fire and calculate its
point of origin to the yard. Within seconds, a position under attack can
return rounds with pin-point accuracy. The French 155mms on Mount Igman
fire shells with a kill-zone of more than 200 yards in diameter.
Mortars are a different story. In fixed sites, they are equally
vulnerable. But they are also man-portable, quick to reassemble and
fire, deadly in effect and easily moved around the mountains. Experience
against the Germans taught that lesson to the fathers and grandfathers
of the current batch of Serb fighters during World War Two.
The prospect of an unrelenting and never-ending guerrilla campaign in
the mountains would be the one scenario Nato governments might balk at.
It is, however, the unpalatable option the enraged Serbs may well
contemplate.
The UN's best chance of capitalising on the shock effect of its
bombardment would be to issue an ultimatum to all sides to begin talks
immediately. It would also have to make crystal clear its intent to use
Nato's immense airpower over the next few weeks to ensure that result.
If the Serbs cannot be made to see sense before winter sets in, or if
they adopt their usual stalling tactics, then the full weight of that
airpower should be brought to bear on their military assets with the aim
of destroying their capacity to wage war. This would involve taking out
as much of their armour, artillery, and command and communication
capability as possible.
The UN is 50 in October. But not since the Korean conflict more than
40 years ago has it faced such a challenge to its integrity and future
credibility. It has enjoyed a long adolescence. It can only be hoped
that it has now at least stepped into the adult world of harsh realities
and even harsher practical decision making.

FOR the first time since the Korean War, their guns thundered out in
anger. The objective was to take out Bosnian Serb artillery positions
overlooking Sarajevo, the very ones responsible for Monday's market
massacre.
First reports were that it had been a remarkably successful operation.
The men of 19 Regiment Royal Artillery -- the Highland Gunners --
launched salvo after salvo from their 105mm field guns at targets
pinpointed by Nato intelligence, including information that had come in
from special forces. The SAS is very much involved in this theatre.
The attack by the Highland Gunners on Serb positions began exactly at
03.45 (British time) and it was relentless. In all, a dozen pieces were
firing shells at chosen targets.
Up to 200 rounds were fired in rapid sequence by the Highland Gunners
in a pre-dawn attack which also involved French and Dutch artillery.
This was the first British involvement in the Nato blitzkrieg on Serbian
positions.
After the London conference, the Bosnian Serbs were warned what was
likely to follow an attack on a safe area. That warning was principally
concerned with the Gorazde safe haven.
However, such was the horror world-wide after Monday's massacre in
Sarajevo that the Western alliance had little option other than to put
into operation the Nato plan to wipe out Bosnian Serb key positions and
ammunition dumps.
Last night, the operation was still in progress.
At the outset of the operation United Nations spokesman
Lieutenant-Colonel Pierre Briere said the targets were essentially heavy
weapons positions and ammunitions depots.
However, it was obvious that it went much further. Without doubt,
communications centres were being wiped out, too, as were key Serb
headquarters.
The Highland Gunners moved into prime positions on Mount Igman high
above Sarajevo earlier in the month. The 19th forms part of the Rapid
Reaction Force.
Until yesterday, everybody believed that they were there only to
protect UN forces. It was only when they opened up their bombardment
that the Bosnian Serbs discovered the reality of the situation.

Tom Gallagher, a lecturer in peace studies at Bradford University,
believes that Western resolve has finally numbered the days of the
leader of the self-styled Republic of Srpska
FOR the first time in 41 months, the besiegers of Sarajevo finally
received a taste of the deadly fire they have poured down on that
defenceless city.
It will long be argued if earlier use of Nato firepower at this level
might have saved the lives of thousands of civilians blown up or shot
since their city slipped off the map of normal Europe in April 1992.
On both sides of the Atlantic spokesmen, from General Colin Powell,
chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Mr Simon Jenkins, former
editor of The Times, have long argued that air strikes of the kind seen
across Bosnia last night would be of scant use. The rough terrain
favoured the rebel Serbs who could hide or move their guns. Besides, had
not blanket bombing failed in Vietnam, only hardening the enemy's
resolve?
The collapse of the Krajina Serbs suggests that comparing the rebel
Serbs, commanded by General Ratko Mladic, with the Vietcong or other
masters of irregular warfare, was rather fanciful. The initiative has
now passed to those analysts who insist that air strikes are capable of
destroying a large part of the rebel Serb war machine from the air.
American satellites and spy planes have located all the missile systems,
communication centres, as well as ammunition and fuel dumps that would
need to be targeted.
But the political will to use Nato firepower against the chief
aggressor in Bosnia only emerged this summer.
Two new developments were crucial. The arrival on the European stage
of France's new President, Jacques Chirac, the only Western leader with
no responsibility for the blundering on Yugoslavia seen since 1991. He
signalled his disgust with the UN's policy of neutrality to ''the
warring factions''. His influence helped ensure that UN civilian
bureaucrats have been eliminated from military decisions in Bosnia.
What will be the response of the poet-psychiatrist, and leader of the
self-styled Republic of Srpska, Radovan Karadzic, as the initiative
turns against rebel Serbs?
On the few past occasions when the West has threatened or carried out
aerial bombardment of his positions, rebel shelling of government
territory has ended suddenly. UN convoys were held up and plundered less
often. Then, when Western resolve vanished, as it did most notably after
the Sarajevo market massacre of January, 1994, the Serbs resumed their
bombing of civilians under the noses of the UN.
But unless Karadzic retires into a dream world where reality and
fantasy merge as one, he should realise that the days when he can dangle
Western emissaries like Lord Owen and Cyrus Vance on a piece of string
are virtually over.
Karadzic is no longer on the high road towards carving out a Greater
Serbia from the remnants of Yugoslavia. The fall of Krajina destroyed
the myth of Serb invincibility and is bound to have increased the sense
of war weariness among the 100,000 fighters controlling the 70% of
Bosnia run from Pale. Their lines of communication are badly stretched
and their morale is already low.
Part of the bad blood between Karadzic and General Mladic stems from
the fact that soldiers were receiving a meagre #10 a month in government
coupons and some were, until recently, owed huge arrears of back pay.
The rebel Serb soldiers were told by their leaders that all of Bosnia
would be at their feet by the first snows of 1993. Yet the poorly-armed
defenders of Sarajevo and other Bosnian towns held off the rebel Serbs
just as in Croatia, a year earlier, lightly-armed Croats had kept the
supposedly invincible Yugoslav army from seizing the coast and land
right up to the edge of Zagreb.
For another two years, Western leaders believed that there was little
point in stopping the Serbs in their tracks. The Balkans were a violent
land and the most violent of the combatants would triumph soon enough.
But Western statecraft and the resolve of Karadzic's men received a body
blow when thousands of forlorn Krajina Serbs of military age rushed
through Bosnia at the start of August to seek refuge in Serbia rather
than stand and fight on Karadzic's turf.
Karadzic has been ditched by his mentor in Belgrade, President
Milosevic, angry that his client refused to follow suit when the leader
of Serbia proper decided it was time to drop hardline nationalism.
Karadzic is not the only diehard in Pale. Rogue intellectuals, war
profiteers, and sundry bureaucrats will keep the Republic of Srpska on
the road as long as possible. With war crimes investigators hovering in
the distance, Karadzic is too notorious to sink into obscurity like his
Krajina counterparts.
Perhaps he goes in fear of the dagger from his own side. Outside the
ski resort of Pale, venue for the 1984 Winter Olympics, Karadzic and his
family enjoy little esteem. His son is exempt from military service
while Sonya, the republic's first lady and press officer, profits
handsomely from the money she can earn from issuing expensive permits to
foreign journalists.
Karadzic has preached bellicose nationalism to feed his ego and line
his pockets. In times of adversity, people who have been subject to
nationalist brainwashing can exact a mighty revenge when they realise
how far they have been duped.
The Sarajevo Government could hasten Karadzic's demise if it chose
this moment to promise all Bosnian Serbs, not directly implicated in his
killing machine, a rightful place in a reconstructed Bosnia. A
proclamation reaffirming Sarajevo's commitment to ethnic tolerance would
scotch rumours that Islamic radicalism is on the rise in government
circles.
But it would be ironic if, having been disowned by his controller in
Belgrade and snubbed by his military commander, Karadzic was extended a
lifeline by the Contact group of nations still searching for a
negotiated settlement.
US negotiator Richard Holbrooke's latest plan awards the rebel Serbs
51% of Bosnia, territory ''cleansed'' of hundreds of thousands of
Muslims. With this plan on the table, perhaps Karadzic feels he can
still have the last laugh on world opinion. When the dust settles after
the Nato mission, it will soon be clear whether there is still any
mileage in the discredited old policy of punishing the victim and
rewarding the aggressor.

Framingham
A MASSACHUSSETS man is suspected of hacking his wife to death with a
butcher knife in a fight about overcooked pasta.
Police say Richard Rosenthal cut her open from throat to navel and
impaled some of her organs on a stake in woods behind their stately
home.
Rosenthal, a senior financial officer in an insurance company, told
police he had fought with his wife about pasta.
Rosenthal, 40, who had his four-month-old daughter with him in his
car, was arrested about midnight yesterday.
A couple called police when he told them: ''I did something terrible.
I want a lawyer.''
Police followed a trail of blood from Rosenthal's suburban Boston home
to the woods and found the beaten, mutilated body of a woman. A butcher
knife was found in the house and a plastic bag full of bloodied men's
clothing was found in Rosenthal's car.
''Her face was bludgeoned. Her chest had been cut from her throat to
her navel. Her heart and lungs had been removed and impaled on a stake
and her body was hidden in bushes,'' said a legal spokesman.
The body has not been identified but Rosenthal's 34-year-old wife,
Laura Jean, had not been seen for at least a day.
Rosenthal denied murder and was ordered to a state mental hospital for
tests.--AP.

MOST trade unionists in Britain are now professionals, managers, and
service providers, with fewer than 40% employed on manual tasks,
according to a TUC report on the changing face of trade unions.
When trade union membership peaked in 1980, the bulk of the 12.2
million members would have been manual employees. However, the steady
decline in traditional industries and the growth in professions and
services have reversed that situation.
Today's Trade Unionists, published today by the TUC using figures
culled from the Government's Labour Force Survey of last autumn, shows
that 7.5 million or nearly one third of Britain's workforce are members
of trades unions or staff associations and that employers of 10.3
million, or virtually half the workforce, recognise trades unions.
Teachers, nurses, lawyers, and accountants are some of the
professional or associate professional workers who make up 28% of all
union members. Another 32% are clerical, personal, and craft workers.
Despite the run down in traditional industries, Wales the North of
England, and Scotland still retain higher levels of trade union
membership and union recognition than in the South.
In Wales 46% of workers belong to trade unions, with 58% of firms
recognising unions. The corresponding figures in the North of England
are 43% and 55%, in Scotland 39% and 55%, while in South-east England
and East Anglia the figures are 27% and 43%.
International comparisons are difficult to make because of differing
definitions. However, the latest OECD estimates from 1990 show that
within Europe there is a very wide range of unionisation, from 83% in
Sweden to 11% in Spain.
At that stage, Britain had a unionisation rate of 39% -- higher than
Germany, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Switzerland, but lower
than Austria, Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.
However, the coverage of collective bargaining tends to be more
extensive in most other EU states, usually with at least 70% of workers
covered by collective agreements, compared with less than 50% in the UK.

TIMBER and tourism are two industries set to benefit from a harbour
redevelopment in Argyll.
The plan to upgrade Ardrishaig harbour will allow greater use of its
facilities for sea-going commercial traffic and help the area attract
more visitors, according to enterprise company and council officials.
The British Waterways project, backed by European Commission funding,
will be one of the first to benefit from assistance through the recently
launched Enable scheme -- a joint initiative by Argyll and Bute District
Council and Argyll and the Islands Enterprise.
In the first phase of the project, which was launched yesterday, basic
improvements will be carried out to the harbour. By the end of the year,
larger vessels will be able to use the pier area, increasing freight
traffic, mainly in timber logs.
Early next year, the second stage of the project will concentrate on
improving facilities for leisure craft. More European funding will be
sought.

Colombo
SRI Lanka's Tamil guerrillas were today holding a state-run ferry
carrying 128 people, a day after they hijacked it in a ploy to attack
and sink two Sri Lankan navy boats.
Some 21 sailors were missing after the attacks and the fate of those
on board the ferry was not known, said military spokesman Brigadier
Sarath Munasinghe.
Sri Lankan air force planes were monitoring the movements of the ferry
Irish Mona off the eastern coastal army base of Mullaitivu, but navy
gunboats were keeping safe distance, fearing more attacks by the
guerrillas, he said.
The ferry, the Irish Mona, was hijacked by the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) yesterday.
''We don't know if the LTTE has taken the civilians and killed them or
whether they are holding them hostage,'' said Munasinghe.
The Navy had sent in two gunboats and Israeli-built Dvora-class
fast-attack craft to inspect the vessel which attacked one of the Dvoras
with what is thought to have been a rocket-propelled grenade, Munasinghe
said.
In another development, a police chief found that torture victims
whose bodies were dumped in lakes and waterways around Colombo were
strangled in a disused toilet in the headquarters of Sri Lanka's elite
police commandos.
Plastic handcuffs were tightened around the victims' necks, CID chief
T V Sumanasekera told reporters. They were left in the toilet for a
couple of hours and then taken away and dumped, he said.
Twenty-one bodies, 13 identified as Tamils, were pulled out of the
waterways between June and the middle this month.
Ten Special Task Force (STF) intelligence personnel, a serviceman, and
seven civilians have been detained on suspicion of involvement in the
case.--Reuter.

THE Government yesterday offered to renew talks in the long-running
National Health Service pay row in a bid to head off widespread
industrial action.
The move, forecast in The Herald yesterday, came as 30,000 NHS
therapists in PAMs (Professions Allied to Medicine) voted overwhelmingly
to take action next month in protest at local pay.
Nine out of 10 physiotherapists, chiropodists, dieticians, and eye
specialists backed a series of actions including the withdrawal of
unpaid overtime. Radiographers are also expected to be strongly opposed
to the move from national to localised bargaining.
A series of one-day strikes is likely to be triggered next week when
Unison, the biggest health union representing 450,000 health workers,
announces the results of its ballot on industrial action.
The NHS director of human resources, Mr Ken Jarrold, has invited all
health unions -- representing around 900,000 workers -- to resume talks
aimed at ending the dispute over the Government's refusal to increase a
1% national pay offer.
Local negotiations would offer the prospect of more pay increases,
some by up to 2%.
Health officials hope employers, unions, and the NHS Executive will be
able to meet on Monday. It is anticipated that discussions then would
centre on a compromise allowing local negotiations to top-up national
awards.
Mr Geoff Scaife, chief executive of the NHS in Scotland, said: ''We
believe the time is right to resume talks between the unions, NHS
executive, and colleagues from other parts of the UK.
''The Government's commitment to local pay is unchanged but the
executives are keen to take forward local pay in a manner which will
command the confidence of staff,'' Mr Scaife said.
Unison, which closed its ballot on strike action yesterday, said it
would arrange urgently a meeting of the unions involved.
Physiotherapists, dieticians, chiropodists, and eye specialists are
the first health professionals to vote for action in the dispute in a
ballot which is believed to have shown a record 74% turn-out. Their
action is due to start on September 21.
Therapists' spokeswoman Jocelyn Prudence said: ''These health
professionals have never considered taking action before.
''The fact they voted so overwhelmingly for it is a clear sign of
their opposition to the implementation of local pay in the NHS.''
Other action to be taken by the four professions will include refusing
to do paperwork not directly linked to patient care and taking full
lunch and tea breaks.
Unison members are understood to have voted overwhelmingly for a
national one-day strike which would be the first to hit the NHS since
the industrial unrest of the late Eighties.
The Scottish National Party said yesterday that the minuscule increase
in Scotland's health allocation for the current year, compared with
England and Wales, was leaving many hospital trusts struggling to meet
the 3% pay rise.
Dr Iain Glen, the party's health spokesman, said: ''The budgets for
hospital, community health, and cash-limited family health services is
4.55% down south compared to less than 0.01% here.
''The NHS Management Executive in Scotland do not appear to have been
aware of the extent of the problem. In areas like Glasgow, which are
facing claw-backs because of the revenue equalisation formula to match
falling populations, the problem is particularly acute.''

BOMBING raids by United States aircraft were at the core of the
strikes against the Serbs. However, yesterday afternoon, the RAF joined
in the orchestrated Nato attack -- the first serious operation mounted
by the alliance since it was founded at the end of the Second World War.
Harrier GR7s dropped 1000lb smart bombs on targets highlighted by
Jaguar aircraft.
A few weeks ago, on board HMS Glasgow in the Adriatic, I had witnessed
the RAF Harrier pilots, newly arrived in the war region, practising
their bombing skills. Yesterday, they put those very skills into effect
with a vengeance.
Other RAF aircraft involved in the continuing operation last night
included Tornados, a TriStar tanker, and an E-3 early warning plane.
The role call of RAF aircraft taking part in Operation Deny Flight,
set up by the Allies in April 1993 to monitor the UN no-fly zone over
Bosnia, is six F3 Tornados based at Gioia del Colle, Italy, six Harriers
at Gioia del Colle, two Harrier reconnaissance aircraft at Gioia del
Colle, six Sea Harrier dual-role aircraft on call on HMS Invincible when
the aircraft carrier is in the Adriatic, and two Tristar tankers at
Palermo, Sicily.
Nato aircraft flew more than 200 sorties in the first several hours of
the operation, by far the heaviest saturation of Western air power over
Bosnia.
A spokesman at Nato's southern command in Naples, said the 200-sortie
mark had been passed by mid-afternoon after 12 or 13 hours of action.
With the operation continuing as dusk fell, he said more than 200
aircraft from Nato nations were available for action in various roles
from bombing to surveillance and most were being used.
The alliance said after the first series of strikes that more than 60
had taken part.

<TEXT>
A PILOT project in Shetland will try to claw back the islands'
position as a major lobster producer by releasing 600 hand-reared baby
crustaceans that they hope will colonise the seabed off the village of
Scalloway.
''Six hundred baby lobsters may seem a drop in the ocean,'' said Mr
Morgan Goodlad, principal of the North Atlantic Fisheries College,
yesterday. ''But this is a pilot exercise to prove that lobster ranching
can work here. The plan is to scale up for possible release of 30,000
next year.''
Mr Leslie Watt, fisheries development officer at the Scalloway
college, said female lobsters could crawl around the Shetland coast for
up to nine months before finding water warm enough to hatch the
thousands of eggs clinging to their tail.
''The trick is to raise the temperature,'' Mr Watt explained in the
''maternity ward'' of the college, where lobster mothers-to-be sit in
individual tanks surrounded by sea water six degrees warmer than the
Atlantic outside.
Once hatched, the problem is to help the lobster larvae escape wild
predators. They eat each other and fish eat most of the survivors.
''Unfortunately, the best food for baby lobsters is baby lobsters,'' Mr
Watt said.
By feeding the babies mussel puree instead of their brothers and
sisters, the survival rate is increased dramatically.
Shetland's lobster stocks were seriously depleted due to over-fishing,
Mr Goodlad said. Only about 5000 a year were now being landed in
Shetland, compared with around 50,000 in the mid 1960s.

A WOMAN who picked up a knife in fear of her life as she faced up to
her brutal lover was yesterday found not guilty of murdering him.
A jury accepted that when Mrs Margaret McNab plunged the knife into
Alan Earl's chest she was acting in self defence.
As the jury -- who took only 45 minutes to reach the verdict --
cleared her, Mrs McNab, 37, collapsed in the dock at the High Court in
Glasgow.
Mrs McNab, only 4ft 10in tall, had been in custody since the night she
stabbed Mr Earl, 34, in their home at Shieldaig Drive, Rutherglen, on
May 5 this year.
In her evidence, she described how she was cornered in the kitchen,
with Earl bearing down on her.
She picked up a knife, meaning just to frighten away her lover but the
blade went into his chest.
A pathologist said only minimal force had been used to inflict the
six-inch deep wound.
Mrs McNab, a divorced mother of two children, said that Earl's
jealousy drove them apart after they had spent three years living
together.
Sobbing, she said that Earl, who was more than a foot taller, would
not let her out of his sight.
He had followed her to work, shadowed her round shops, and stood
nearby as she visited friends.
Mrs McNab told her defence counsel, Miss Ruth Anderson, that she was
frequently battered, kicked, and bruised by Earl. She claimed that
sometimes he had banged his head off walls in his rages.
She said she had pleaded with him to get medical help for his
obsession but he never did, even after promising that he would.
That night, she told him to get out after yet another argument but he
followed her into the kitchen and would not let her leave.
Mrs McNab said she felt something awful was going to happen to her and
picked up a knife to frighten him. She told the court she accepted that
she had killed him.
Even after being stabbed through the heart, the man kicked and smashed
a wall light as he left the house.
He collapsed in the street, with Mrs McNab sobbing beside him, patting
his head. Despite surgeons' efforts to save him, he died later in
hospital.
Mrs McNab told Miss Anderson that the reason she kept on being
reunited with Earl was her hope that he would change back to the loving
person she once knew.
Her sons Paul, 17, and Stephen, 13, said they had witnessed many
attacks by Earl on their mother. Several times when he saw his mother
being beaten up, Paul defended her and punched Earl off.
However, that night, when he had her trapped in the kitchen, Earl told
Mrs McNab: ''Your precious son is not here to protect you now.'' It was
then she stabbed him.
Her son Stephen told the court that he had often phoned the police to
get help for his mother.
That night, he sat on the stairs crying as he listened to their
quarrel.

EMPLOYERS who collude in benefit fraud with workers were warned
yesterday they will continue to be pursued.
Last year, the Employment Service referred 22 employers and 530
workers to the procurator-fiscal for such offences. Inspectors
discovered total fraud of #10.4m, with a net saving to taxpayers of
#7.2m.
Mr Alan Brown, director of the Employment Service in Scotland, said:
''Employers should be warned that if they cheat the taxpayers by
encouraging their workers to claim unemployment benefit, they will face
prosecution.''
He said the work of the fraud teams had led to 9190 people withdrawing
their benefit claims.
A campaign in Hamilton, Elgin, Drumchapel in Glasgow, and Dundee
stopped 354 claims, saving #347,000.
However, Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar, said the
claimed savings were dwarfed by the amount of unclaimed benefits.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Low Pay Unit said: ''A more positive
approach would be to try and make legitimate work worth doing.''

HIGHLAND Health Board is being sued for #40,000 by the husband of a
woman who drowned herself in September, 1992, when she was allowed out
unsupervised from an Inverness hospital where her suicidal tendencies
had already been noted.
Mr David Trice, from near Plockton, is appealing to the Court of
Session in the belief that the death of his wife, Mrs Mary Jean Trice,
48, an art teacher, could have been avoided.
He said yesterday: ''I only want to make those responsible
accountable, not to make money out of the action. No amount of money
will bring my wife back.''
His Court of Session submission argues that two named psychiatrists,
others unnamed, and psychologists at the hospital, should have diagnosed
his wife's condition, treated it with appropriate drugs, recognised the
increased risk of her committing suicide, and supervised her
accordingly.
In April 1991, Mrs Trice developed mental illness and was referred to
Craig Dunain Hospital by one of her GPs, who indicated she was suffering
from manic psychosis. From March 1992, Mrs Trice began to exhibit signs
of depression.
On July 17, Mrs Trice was again referred to Craig Dunain, this time by
another of her GPs, whose referral form stated she was a suicide risk.
She told the admitting doctor she had had suicidal thoughts the previous
night. He diagnosed her as suffering from agitated depression.
The summons continues: ''He indicated in the admission notes that she
'should be sectioned' if she tries to leave (ie formally detained). In
fact, she was discharged a few hours later. She was admitted as an
inpatient the following day and remained in Craig Dunan until July 20,
1992. . .
''The deceased was again admitted to Craig Dunain as an inpatient from
August 10, 1992, until her death on September 13. She was admitted after
she had attempted to commit suicide.''
0 The summons concludes: ''Between about 10am and 11am on Sunday,
September 13, 1992, the deceased was allowed out of Craig Dunain on her
own. Later, her body was recovered from the Caledonian Canal.''
A spokesman for Highland Health Board said yesterday: ''Following Mrs
Trice's death, an internal inquiry was conducted. The board's legal
advisers are dealing with the formal legal inquiries relating to this
action.''

FOR some fishermen the ultimate quarry may be a killer whale, for
others a Great White shark. But for years, stalwart members of Prince
Albert Sea Angling Club, at Macclesfield, Cheshire, have been journeying
north to Scotland to pursue their dreams of catching a giant halibut.
Angler Derek Martin, 56, hooked this 182lb monster of the deep off the
north of Scotland -- after 12 years of trying. Since he is a press
photographer, there was a camera to record the scene on the quay at
Lochinver, in Sutherland.
Mr Martin, of Wythenshaw, Manchester, fishing from Mr Willie MacLeod's
37ft boat, Fortitude, made his catch on an 80lb breaking-strain line
from waters 140ft beneath the surface of The Minch, near Stoer Point, in
north-west Sutherland. He set up his camera for his fellow club member,
Mr Malcolm Forster, to click the button.
Mr Martin, who has spent thousands of pounds hunting the elusive
halibut off Caithness, Orkney, and Sutherland, at least got some return
on his investment -- the halibut sold for #312 at the wholesale fish
auction at Lochinver.
Yesterday, he said: ''A feeling of pure elation came over me when I
realised there was a real monster on the end of my line. I have been
hooked on catching a big halibut for a dozen years. You could say that
it is a bit of an obsession with me and my colleagues in the Prince
Albert Club. Many of them have been making summer pilgrimages to the far
north of Scotland in quest of this quarry for many, many years.''
It took Mr Martin, chief photographer of a chain of weekly newspapers
in Cheshire and Lancashire, three-quarters-of-an-hour to play the fish
and reel it in.
The catch is the biggest of the yearbut fell short of the British
record, 234lb, taken from Scrabster, Caithness, in 1979. Now it is
heading for dinner plates at an exclusive London restaurant -- halibut
is prized for the fine texture and taste of its firm white flesh.
Mr Hardy was using a Hardy All-Roller 80lb rod, with a green marine
line and a whole 2lb mackerel as bait.
* Bird lover Robert Coote was fishing for carp at Withy Pool, in
Bedfordshire, when he saw a giant catfish emerge and swallow a duck.
Swearing revenge, he swapped to stronger tackle and caught the fish,
which weighed 57lb 8oz -- beating the 49lb 12oz record set in 1993.

CARDINAL Thomas Winning of Glasgow opened an all-faith prayer vigil
for the people of Bosnia with the warning that the recent intervention
by Nato forces in the conflict could lead to an escalation of the war.
As he led prayers for the innocent victims of the Bosnian conflict, he
told those gathered at the Glasgow -- City With A Conscience prayer
event that this was ''the bitter reality of war'' and that ''every war
is prone to descend into the mire of ever-worsening barbarism, which to
every person of goodwill must be unacceptable''.
Cardinal Winning said that he had heard the military engagement in
Bosnia, in retaliation for the Serb shelling of Sarajevo, variously
described as ''a high-risk venture, drastic measure, and as a defining
moment in the Bosnian War''.
''Whether we are at the threshold of the beginning of the end or have
reached the end of the beginning remains to be seen,'' he said.
''There is today a pressing need for prayer. Shared prayer such as
this is a valuable witness to this world that the different religions
can and do work for the common good,'' he said.
He added: ''The war in Bosnia also stands as a reproach to the
international community and, in saying that, I do not wish to point an
accusing finger at political leaders alone for what is undeniably a
terrible failure of dialogue and diplomacy.
''The fact of the matter is that for all too long we have all been
television spectators of mass slaughter and have been content to leave
the matter to others to solve.''
Cardinal Winning praised the work of the Scottish Catholic aid agency
SCIAF, and added: ''Many lorries of relief have travelled across Europe
for humanitarian assistance, which is in itself remarkable and a tribute
to that sense of compassion which has seen more Scots making the
ultimate sacrifice of their lives to try and serve their brothers and
sisters in need.''
After leading the prayers at the vigil in Glasgow District Council's
City Chambers, Cardinal Winning warned the action would probably mean
the loss of more life.
He added that there was also a high risk that the role of the United
Nations peacekeeping forces in Bosnia would be misinterpreted.
Cardinal Winning said: ''About five weeks ago, I sent a letter to the
Prime Minister and ambassadors in this country and to Mr Rifkind asking
them, for God's sake, to do something about this. You felt at the time
there was a terrible reluctance to do anything''.
The 12-hour vigil opened with a reading from the Koran. The president
of the Islamic Centre, Muhammad Tufail Shaheen, was one of the first
religious leaders to speak. He said: ''This is essentially a time for
prayers and not for speeches.''
Among the other religious leaders in Scotland who led prayers were
Imam Abdul Rehman Abid from the Islamic Centre, Glasgow, and the Rev
Sidney Coleman, moderator of the Glasgow Presbytery of the Church of
Scotland. Meanwhile, a leading European churchman yesterday expressed
concern over the situation in Bosnia, and nuclear weapons testing,
emphasising that there were many pressing reasons why churches must
continue their struggle for peace and justice throughout the world.
Dr Milan Opocensky, secretary of the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, was speaking in Edinburgh at a convention of the alliance.
A former professor of theology in Prague, Dr Opocensky referred to the
fact that France was continuing with nuclear testing in the Pacific and
that he had worries about similar testing in China.
Stating that there were pressing reasons for the churches to
intervene, he said: ''The immediate task is support of the comprehensive
test ban treaty.
''Human rights are being violated and the environment is in jeopardy.
The overall situation calls for demilitarisation of international
relations.''

A CLIMBER survived yesterday after falling 40ft from a pinnacle
alongside the Old Man of Storr, six miles north of Portree, in Skye.
After the accident occurred, a colleague of the injured man used a
mobile telephone to alert police at Portree.
Skye Mountain Rescue team was called out and a Coastguard helicopter
from Stornoway was scrambled.
Rescuers found that the man had not fallen from the Old Man -- a 160ft
rock-stack on the ridge of the 2359ft Storr Rock -- as had been thought.
He fell about 40ft from an adjoining vertical pinnacle alongside its
more famous neighbour, in the Trotternish area of the island.
The injured climber was taken to the MacKinnon Memorial Hospital.

A FOOD safety expert yesterday defended a cheese in court and
criticised the way it had been tested for bacteria.
Clydesdale district environmental health department is seeking an
order under the 1990 Food Act to destroy #27,000 worth of Lanark blue
cheese because it alleges it is heavily contaminated with the bacteria,
listeria monocytogenes.
Cheesemaker Humphrey Errington, of Walston Braehead farm, Dunsyre,
Lanarkshire, says the levels of listeria in his cheese are harmless.
At Lanark Sheriff Court, Dr Richard North, a food safety adviser who
has worked with a number of Government agencies, made a scathing attack
on the Scottish Agricultural College's method of testing cheese samples.
He said he had studied the farm cheese process and was confident it
was unlikely listeria monocytogenes could have survived in the process,
except in very small numbers.
He did not believe the germs could multiply in the farm's ripening
store because the temperature was too low.
He said: ''In short, the results do not make biological sense.''
He spoke of the lack of sterile controls and said that without them:
''I believe Dr James Bruce (head of SAC's food microbiology unit) is not
in a position to know whether the Lanark blue samples were
contaminated.''
He concluded that as forensic samples the laboratory work had ''little
merit and should be disregarded''.
Dr North was also highly critical of Clydesdale district, Dr Sayed
Ahmed (a public health consultant for Lanarkshire Health Board), and Dr
James McLauchlin, of the Public Health Laboratory Services, over the
acceptance of the laboratory results.
The witness said the strain of listeria discovered in the cheese was
in fact one never recorded as being harmful to humans.
The case was adjourned until September 27, when Dr North will continue
his evidence.

A BID by the new Labour-dominated Edinburgh City Council to take over
the giant Lothian bus operation serving the capital and many surrounding
towns and communities has shocked party colleagues in the three other
new councils in the region.
The move has set the Edinburgh council on a possible collision course
with neighbouring East Lothian and Midlothian councils -- both served by
the network -- that could prove embarrassingly divisive for Labour. The
lack of prior consultation has also angered councillors in West Lothian,
where services were withdrawn at the beginning of this year.
The issue is expected to cause conflict next Tuesday at a scheduled
meeting of the liaison committee, formed to discuss the running of
existing region-based operations once the new unitary authorities are in
power, next year.
On Tuesday, the Edinburgh council unanimously agreed to call on the
Scottish Office to give it control of Lothian Region Transport,
Scotland's only council-owned bus company.
Yesterday, Councillor Richard Small, Midlothian Labour group
secretary, accused the council of attempting to ''hijack'' the company.
''It is a very contentious move by Edinburgh. We are very concerned
about it. We want to continue to be represented on the board and be able
to protect the services that we enjoy,'' he said.
In East Lothian, Councillor Norman Murray, leader of the new council,
said: ''We shall certainly oppose the move.''

A VIDEO that simulates serious accidents and shows footage of
fire-raising and vandalism is to be distributed to all Scottish schools
as part of a national child travel safety campaign.
The Safe School Travel initiative, launched yesterday by the Scottish
School Boards Association, will provide a code of behaviour and
educational material for pupils, parents, and teachers. It hopes to
reduce Scotland's high rate of child casualties on school journeys.
The campaign follows the death of two boys in a school bus crash on
the B7016 near Biggar last February, and mounting unease over the
problem of bullying.
The video, shot by Strathclyde Regional Council, features footage shot
by hidden cameras on school buses in England.
Pupils are seen startinga fire in one vehicle, and on another journey,
children are attacked by pupils throwing bricks from outside the bus.
SSBA president Ms Ann Hill said the explicit nature of the film was
necessary because travel was ''the most important issue'' affecting
pupils' safety.

NATO airstrikes have dealt Russia's ambitions in former Yugoslavia a
bitter blow and left the Kremlin fuming on the sidelines, foreign policy
analysts said yesterday.
''Moscow is at a loss and its initial reaction to the raids shows that
it has no clear idea of what to do,'' Maxim Yusin, an observer for the
respected Izvestia newspaper, said.
''Russia has lost out in the latest round of Bosnian 'musical
chairs','' he said. ''Western states find it easier to co-ordinate
actions between themselves and they no longer need Russia's services.''
Russian officials said they had not been consulted on the raids and
President Boris Yeltsin condemned both the Nato and the Serb attacks.
The Russian Foreign Ministry accused both sides of escalating the
conflict. Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin, quoted by Interfax news
agency, implicitly accused the West of backing the Bosnian Muslims.
Karasin said Russia was considering ''active steps in connection with
the worsening situation in the Balkans''.
But Interfax quoted the head of the Foreign Ministry department in
charge of UN policy as saying that there were no legal grounds for
Moscow to protest against the Nato strike.
If the West does snub Yeltsin, his role in the crisis could be reduced
to a domestic one -- deciding whether or not to veto a law already
passed by parliament ordering Russia to withdraw unilaterally from UN
sanctions against rump Yugoslavia. -- Reuter

A CAMPAIGN to combat prejudice and discrimination was launched
yesterday against a Scottish backdrop that has seen a 25% increase in
racial incidents reported to the police since 1990.
Standing Together Against Racism (Star), which was unveiled in
Glasgow, grew out of Strathclyde Regional Council's racial equality
policy. A 1993 review recommended that there should be a campaign to
raise public awareness of the issues involved.
By the time its form had been agreed, however, the region's days were
numbered and it was felt that the campaign would be more effective if
local groups worked together to present a united stand against racism in
the West of Scotland.
A charter for action has been drawn up and individuals and
organisations have been asked to sign copies and display them. They can
also draw on other ideas to fight racism in a package aimed at
businesses, local authorities, and public companies.
Councillor Malcolm Green, chairman of the region's committee on race
equality, said: ''Developing and putting into practice a comprehensive
racial equality policy has been a major concern of the council in recent
years, so much so that the budget devoted to racial equality has grown
to #300,000.
''But money is, in the last resort, not what really matters. It is
attitudes and commitment that count. And the council can be successful
in helping to change attitudes only if we stand together with others
against the evil of racism and in favour of positive measures to promote
equality.
''We have launched this campaign to provide an opportunity for
everyone who wants to see Scotland become a truly harmonious,
multi-racial society to sign a charter of commitment to that ideal and
then to work to fulfil the ideal.''
The charter was welcomed by Mr Subhash Joshi, chairman of the Ethnic
Minorities Business Forum: ''It is simple and easily understood by
everyone. We hope it will present an opportunity to go forward.''
The charter recognises that racism is a threat to the safety, quality
of life, and stability of local communities. It pledges that together
people will:
* Work to break down barriers between people of different ethnic
origins.
* Share information to help eliminate racism.
* Provide practical support to victims of racial harassment.
* Strive for equality of opportunity for all sections of our local
community in the planning and delivery of services.
* Develop and monitor procedures to ensure racial equality in
recruitment, training, and progression of employees.

<HEADLINE>Council faces #6m housing budget crisis</HEADLINE>

GLASGOW council is #6m over budget in housing costs, five months into
the financial year.
The news broke at a private meeting of Labour councillors yesterdayand
the city's housing department immediately came under fire for a lack of
financial control.
Fearful that many projects in their wards would be shelved and
redundancies created, councillors agreed that the authority's repairs
and renewals fund be tapped to cover the #6m overspend.
However, that money will have to be repaid to the fund in the next
financial year and there are concerns that schemes like dampness
eradication, window replacement, and central-heating installation could
be curtailed.
Rent levels are likely to rise as a consequence.
Unlike other council departments, housingbuilds ''slippage'' into its
capital budget. Although resources for the current financial year were
estimated at #97m, the department planned a programme costing #111m to
allow for the possibility of additional resources being granted and
projects delayed.
However, the Government has not granted any additional capital
spending consent. In addition, sales of council houses and land, and
stock transfers are likely to be well below estimates.
Housing officials feel they can get the capital account back down to
its estimate of #97m by delaying existing projects and making no further
commitments to new ones.
Nevertheless, this does not address the shortfall in capital receipts
of #3m, plus the fact the demolition budget is #3m over due to speedy
progress in the recent fine weather.
Council sources admitted yesterday that the affair was embarrassing.
''We'll have to use a bit of creative accountancy to get us off the
hook on this one,'' a council insider said.
* Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth has been asked by a united front
of opposition councillors to investigate allegedly undemocratic
behaviour by Glasgow's Labour administration.
All four opposition parties -- Conservative, Liberal, Militant, and
SNP -- have signed a letter protesting that a Militant councillor, Mr
Charles Stevenson, was denied the right to ask questions when a council
committee was considering allegations of a #20,000 financial
irregularity in connection with a number of Easterhouse community
projects.
Labour leader, Councillor Patrick Lally, said it would be
inappropriate to comment as the matter had been referred to the police
and was, therefore, sub-judice.

AFTER 40 months of being easy prey to Serb gunners, Sarajevans
rejoiced yesterday at the sight of lethal Serb positions being pounded
by Nato bombs and British and French UN artillery shells.
''Beautiful. It was beautiful,'' said 54-year-old Kemal Koric of the
night attacks on Serb positions. ''I was wrapped in a blanket on my
balcony watching for hours. First you'd see a burst of fire on one side
and then on the other. It was fantastic.''
Earlier, Musrata Sabic grinned as she leaned out from her balcony for
a better view of the planes hitting Serb positions in the hills above
her city. Bright flashes of light were seen in the predawn darkness. An
enormous cloud, tinged with the red of flames, glowed over a hill that
forms the city's northern front line.
''I feel good, oh yes!'' Sabic said. ''I feel good, probably for the
first time in this war. It looks like they are skinning them alive!''
''It's funny,'' said Salih Daznlic, watching the action in front of
his house on a hill that gave him a good view of the whole city. ''We
are in the middle of heavy fighting, explosions are echoing and planes
are swooping overhead. But nobody is targeting us.
''Finally the wheel of fortune has turned and the hunter has become
the hunted,'' he said. ''And only yesterday I was scared even to peek
through the window because of Serb gunners.''
The first Nato war planes were audible around the Bosnian capital just
before 2am, after which detonations could be heard and flashes lit the
skies over Serb-held territory south and east of Sarajevo. Some 10,500
Sarajevo residents have been killed and 50,000 others wounded by Serb
mortars, rockets, and sniping into the city since April 1992 when the
war began.
Waves of Nato jets roared in high above the city and a single
propeller-driven plane could often be heard droning through the night.
Other than the thud of distant detonations, the city remained
extraordinarily quiet while the most intensive outside military
intervention in the Bosnia conflict unfolded.
A television crew in the west of the city could see anti-aircraft
tracer fire snaking into the night skies as Serb gunners tried to shoot
down attacking planes.
A huge secondary explosion and burst of flame north of the city was
believed to have come from a Nato bombing run on a Serb ammunition
factory in the suburb of Vogosca.
Government radio said that factory as well as an ammunition dump at
the Bosnian Serb army barracks in Lukavica, south-east of the city, had
been hit, as had key communications facilities on Jahorina mountain.
As Nato warplanes roared overhead a porter from the city's destroyed
Unys office towers scampered out to the middle of Sarajevo's notorious
sniper alley and dared Serb gunners on the hillside opposite to fire on
him.
''Why don't you come out now you Chetnik (Serb) bastards?'' the man
screamed, waving his hands in the air. ''Why don't you come out and
shoot at me now?''
Artillery from the UN Rapid Reaction Force on Mount Igman, west of the
city, opened up on Serb targets at about 4am in a stunning display of
firepower that rocked the capital.
UN guns, which include French 155mm howitzers and British 105mm light
artillery, pounded Serb positions in the Sarajevo suburbs of Ilidza and
Lukavica, where separatist forces maintain major military positions.
With the first light of dawn appearing over the city at about 5.30am
the Muslim call to prayer could be heard wafting from mosques even as UN
artillery rumbled to the west.
Skies, which had cleared on Tuesday evening after a day of rain just
in time for the Nato bombing runs, closed in again at dawn yesterday and
a few incoming artillery rounds could be heard landing in the fog-bound
capital. Bosnian Government radio advised residents in the city to clear
the streets and remain home for all but essential journeys.
The reception to the Nato attack could not have been more different in
Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold less than 10 miles from Sarajevo.
''Those bastards. Hope they rot in hell,'' said Serb soldier Mirko
Vasic, pointing at a jet streaking overhead. ''They'll never crush us.
Never.'' Pale residents shook their fists at the planes hitting targets
near the town. When the aircraft sent tracers down to the ground,
children cheered, thinking it was their fathers and brothers shooting
anti-aircraft rounds at the jets.
Bombs hit the army barracks in Pale, sending a huge plume of black
smoke into the air as the thud of anti-aircraft guns intensified. One
warplane, a French Mirage, took a hit and exploded as it crashed. Its
two crew members bailed out, their parachutes floating into the nearby
hills.
News of the hit brought Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic rushing
to the window of the television building, where he had been giving
interviews. ''Find the pilot, find the pilot,'' he shouted.

THERE have been large reductions in the number of domestic customers
disconnected by the two Scottish electricity companies.
The number of complaints has also dropped.
The figures have been revealed in a new report by the director general
of electricity supply, Professor Stephen Littlechild, who says he is
pleased at the continued improvement in most areas of performance.
Professor Littlechild, in his report on customer service for 1994-95,
says 13 of the 14 companies, which include ScottishPower and
Hydro-Electric, reported improved performance over the previous year in
meeting guaranteed service levels.
The number of domestic customers disconnected by ScottishPower dropped
from 936 in 1992-93 to 67 in 1993-94 and has now reduced to 27, the
latter being a fall of almost 60%.
The number in Hydro-Electric reduced from 471 three years ago to 227
in 1993-94. It has now dropped to 14, a 94% reduction between 1993-94
and l994-95.
His report, in addition to summarising performance, includes
statistics on customer complaints handled by the Office of Electricity
Regulation.
On customer complaints received by Offer and the Electricity
Consumers' Committees, ScottishPower had 615 in 1994-95 compared with
896 the previous year. Complaints about Hydro-Electric dropped to 370
from 463.

TWO areas of Scotland's civil justice system in need of attention were
highlighted yesterday by a senior member of the judiciary.
Lord Gill, Senator of the College of Justice, told the annual
conference of Citizens Advice Scotland that a major overhaul of the
system was required which would both ensure that access to justice was
not denied on the basis of cost but would also ensure that litigation
did not become a citizen's first, rather than last, resort.
He told delegates it had once been said the courts were open to all,
like the doors of the Ritz, but today the doors of the courts were open
only to those such as large companies and people on legal aid for whom
finance was not a major concern.
''The second area of deficiency is the question of access to legal
remedies for those who have problems which are minor in themselves but
are of vital importance to the person concerned.'' One argument was that
there should be more ready access to the courts by reducing the costs of
lawyers' bills, by simplifying procedures, and by increasing the number
of courts. He was not convinced that was a desirable way forward and
feared it could lead to a litigious society.
Lord Gill said: ''Where serious and substantial claims are made, there
has to be some deterrent to frivolity. There has to be some safeguard
against nuisance value litigation. Likewise, where serious and
substantial claims are concerned, I do not see why it should be thought
to be a priority to have cheap procedures by which such claims should be
tested or to have it done, if that were possible, at bargain rates.
''As the law now stands, there is a very wide overlap between the
jurisdictions of the Court of Session and the Sheriff Court to the
extent that for most litigations including family litigations it is to a
great extent at the option of the pursuer in which court he brings his
case. In these respects, few would deny that our system has scope for
progress.
''It cannot be right that by choosing the most expensive available
forums, especially with trade union or insurance company support or with
the benefit of legal aid, a pursuer can run his opponent into the
unnecessary risk of costs.
''This is particularly hard to the 'in-between' litigants -- the
litigant who is marginally too well off to qualify for legal aid but is
by no means well enough off to conduct litigation effectively at his own
expense.''
He suggested the introduction of the principle of subsidiarity by
which every litigation should be confined to the lowest level of the
system at which it may be competently conducted.
''Resources, whether judicial or administrative, would be directed
only to those litigations with which those resources are best equipped
to deal,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Staff groups say council changes put cash increases in question. Fears for funding of extra police</HEADLINE>

POLICE staff associations in Strathclyde expressed fears that funding
for extra officers announced yesterday would not be available due to the
reorganisation of local government.
The organisations failed to be reassured by Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, the Home Affairs Minister. This raises the spectre of
funding chaos next year, when Strathclyde Regional Council disappears
and the 12 new unitary authorities take over the police authority role.
It emerged yesterday, as Lord James announced the additional 400
police officers for Strathclyde, that the only hope the Government could
offer was that the new authorities would have the same set of
priorities.
There are, however, no guarantees that the councils making up the new
joint police board will follow the current expansionist line which has
led, courtesy of Chief Constable Leslie Sharp's special 90-day
operations, to falling crime throughout the region.
Lord James was asked where the new money would come from, at a time
when regional councils were spending #17m more on policing than the
level of grant-aided expenditure approved by the Government (#13m of
that by Strathclyde).
He said: ''I can only give you an assurance that the needs of the
police will be given very high priority and even if the next public
expenditure round is a tight one we will do our best to meet all the
operational needs concerned.''
As predicted in The Herald yesterday, Lord James formally announced
that the Scottish Office was approving the recruitment of another 258
officers and 181 civilians by Strathclyde Police.
The new recruits, who will finally bring the force up to a realistic
strength are to be paid for out of savings from the existing overtime
budget. What happens when the current overtime budget is exhausted is
the concern of the staff associations.
Mr Tom Rowatt, secretary of Strathclyde Police Federation, said: ''The
announcement by Lord James is pleasing but there should be no euphoria.
Strathclyde Police needs the additional officers, no doubt about that.
''But police overtime is not there to put more cash into officers'
pockets. It is structured to service the courts, provide cover at
football matches, demonstrations, and major police operations such as
murder inquiries.
''The financing of this increase will mean officers will be thinly
spread and their welfare could suffer. The police service in Scotland,
and Strathclyde in particular, requires a proper commitment from the
Government that the new local authorities receive sufficient funding.''
Chief Superintendent Jack Urquhart, president of the Scottish Police
Superintendents' Association said: ''The police service is facing
potentially a very serious funding crisis if the Government fails to
provide more financial resources in the years ahead.
''There is no point in approving increases in establishment if this is
not backed up with a guarantee that adequate grant will be provided.''
Any failure to sustain the required funding levels would render Lord
James's approval of the new staffing level as nothing more than a hollow
political gesture with the end result being cuts in existing police
strengths, he said.

A PREGNANT woman who helped save the lives of three foreign students
after their car ''took off'' from an East Lothian hump-backed bridge,
hit a tree, and crashed down an embankment, was honoured for her bravery
yesterday.
Mrs Veronica Hynd, who gave birth to Daniel within days of the rescue,
was accompanied at an awards ceremony by two men, Mr David Thomson and
Mr Robert White, who dragged the injured driver from the burning
vehicle.
The two male passengers in the car, which crashed on the
Ormiston-Tranent road, had managed to scramble clear.
Yesterday, Mrs Hynd, 27, said: ''I had to do it and I would do it
again.''
Lothian and Borders Police, paying tribute to the rescuers' courage
and tenacity, said that without their fast reactions and display of
bravery the victims of the crash may have died in the fire.
At the same ceremony, a man who chased two armed bank raiders, despite
being fired at with a sawn-off shotgun at close range, was also
honoured.
The raiders were eventually caught.
The incident happened last year at a bank in Edinburgh's Gorgie area
and five other men who helped 33-year-old sales representative Mr Brian
Malcolm also received awards.
Mr Malcolm, driving a truck, suspected the two were about to rob the
bank and reversed up to the front door.
The raiders, however, escaped and one fired the shotgun at him.
The men fled but were seen by Mr Charles Burnett, who alerted police.
Mr Malcolm meanwhile took up pursuit again, telling two others, Mr
Alan Blyth and Mr Fraser Boath, of the situation. At the same time, Mr
Edward Sinclair and Mr Gary Richards joined the chase.
In another awards ceremony yesterday, a police officer who was
confronted by a man pointing a double-barrelled shotgun at her was given
a top bravery award.
Paul Macklin held the weapon eight inches from the chest of
Policewoman Della Thom and shouted: ''Back off, back off, or I will blow
you away.''
She then helped chase Macklin and another man, Robert Cadiz, through
the streets of Aberdeen.
They were convicted of armed robbery and Macklin was sentenced to
eight years' imprisonment and Cadiz nine years.
Ms Thom, 26, said yesterday she had found the incident ''very scary''
but that she did not consider herself to be a heroine.
She was presented with the Queen's Commendation for Bravery by
Aberdeen's depute lieutenant, Mr Leslie Robertson.
Three of Ms Thom's colleagues who took part in the chase, Constables
Keith Knowles and Neil MacKenzie, and Sergeant James Bilsland, also
received the award.

RAILTRACK chief Robert Horton yesterday admitted that there was ''room
for improvement'' on safety issues in the wake of concerns including a
botched project in Scotland that led to 10 signalling failures.
Mr Horton insisted that safety achievements were adequate but added:
''I think we still have a way to go on safety and I am not complacent.''
His comments -- at a briefing of transport journalists -- cut no ice
with Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher, who declared: ''No
charm offensive by Railtrack's harassed senior managers can cover up
vital questions which must be fully and properly answered before
Railtrack is offered for sale.''
At the briefing in London, Mr Horton and Railtrack officials dealt
with two damaging leaked reports, including one from Mr Jack Rose,
safety manager, which spoke of flawed procedures within the company.
Mr Rose had warned it could be 18 months before full safety procedures
were in place and that there was a danger of ''another Clapham'' -- a
reference to the London rail disaster in which 35 people died in
December, 1988.
The other damaging report detailed a rewiring scheme on the
Glasgow-Stirling-Perth line in which signals gave the all-clear instead
of an automatic stop 10 times between October and March.
Such ''wrong-side failures'' are widely regarded as the ultimate
safety hazard and the report also disclosed recommendations following
inquiries into the Clapham and Newton disasters, in which 39 died, were
ignored.
Railtrack's safety director David Rayner admitted there would be
''some initial problems with contractors'' but measures were being taken
to ensure safety was built in to the conditions of all future
contracting jobs.
Mr Meacher yesterday wrote to Transport Secretary Sir George Young,
asking if the break-up of British Rail into 94 parts for privatisation
would affect safety.

A SURVEY of passengers on the London to Fort William sleeper service,
showing they spent nearly #500 each while at Lochaber, is further
evidence of the need to retain the route, say campaigners.
Travellers using the service spent an estimated #240,000 during a
three-week period.
The investigation of 500 passengers, carried out in May and June, was
commissioned by local enterprise company Lochaber Limited and action
group Friends of the West Highland Line.
It showed that visitors spent an average of nearly #500 on a typical
six-day stay.
The survey was carried out following legal action by Highland Regional
Council which ensured a temporary reprieve for the service.

AN MP was abused and punched in the face during a dispute on the
doorstep of his home, Kilmarnock Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
Mr Brian Donohoe, Labour MP for Cunninghame South, suffered bruising
to his eye during the incident in February of this year after he had
answered a call at his door from two youths.
The court heard that the youths, Gary Doherty and John Muldoon, had
called to discuss compensation for a door which had been damaged at the
home of Doherty's cousin some weeks previously.
Doherty, of Warrix Avenue, faced charges of assault and breach of the
peace, while his co-accused, of Adams Walk, Irvine, was accused of
breach of the peace.
Mr Donohoe, 46, of Greenfield Drive, Irvine, said he had declined to
discuss the matter with the pair, saying he wanted to discuss it with
the owner of the house directly.
He told Mr Will Andrew, procurator-fiscal depute, that Gary Doherty
had told him he was there to collect money on behalf of his cousin and
added: ''I told him that he had no locus in the matter and that if
anyone was to come to my door it was his cousin Brian Murray.''
Mr Donohoe added: ''He became aggressive towards me . . . he came
towards me then he hit out at me with his fist. He punched me on the
left eye.''
The MP agreed with Mr Andrew that he suffered a darkened or black eye
but that he decided not to seek medical attention.
He continued: ''The two youths left and stood on the garden wall with
Doherty shouting that he was going to murder me and my children.''
He said he had considered Muldoon to be a threat but agreed that, once
he had been struck, Muldoon had stepped in ''acting as a peacemaker''.
He denied he had been the aggressor during the incident, saying that
any physical contact he had with Doherty had been to defend himself.
Mr Graham Donohoe, 18, said he had seen both accused making Nazi-style
salutes on the garden wall and shouting abuse before leaving.
Gary Doherty told his agent Mr Irvine that he had gone to Mr Donohoe's
house to find out what was happening about compensation for a damaged
door at his cousin's house.
He said: ''He refused to talk about it . . . he was very aggressive
and poked me in the chest. I was on the step below him and he pushed me
down then made a move like he was going to punch me. I felt threatened,
then I hit him in the eye.''
The accused conceded that he had shouted and made rude gestures
because he was angry.
Sheriff David Smith found Doherty guilty on both charges but told
Muldoon: ''I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that you committed
a breach of the peace. I find you not guilty.''
He deferred sentence on Doherty, who is unemployed and has no previous
convictions, until September 19 for background reports.

AN entertainer appearing on the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was fined
#1000 for a breach of the peace yesterday.
Rhona Cameron shouted and swore when police officers told her to turn
her music down at 4.20am, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard.
When they decided to arrest her, she struggled with them.
Cameron, a comedian and a presenter on the BBC2 show Gaytime TV,
admitted a breach of the peace at the flat she was renting for the
festival in Leslie Place, Edinburgh, on August 18.
Sheriff Nigel Thomson decided on the figure of #1000 for the fine as
it represents a little more than a week's income for Cameron, who is
originally from Musselburgh but now lives in London. She was charged
under her real name, Campbell.
Depute fiscal Anne Keenan told Sheriff Thomson the police had received
a complaint about the noise from Cameron's flat at 4.20am.
When she answered the door, she told them she paid #1000 a month for
the flat so she could make as much noise as she wanted.
The officers warned her that unless she turned the music down they
would be back but she treated their warning as a joke.
She began to shout and swear, then struggled when she was arrested and
was handcuffed.
Solicitor John Keenan said Cameron, 29, was full of remorse and had
written to the police officers to apologise.
On the night of the incident, she had gone out drinking with friends
after her show at the Assembly Rooms.
They went back to the flat and were playing music with all the windows
open because of the hot weather.
None of the neighbours complained to her before calling the police and
Cameron took exception to the fact that the officers seemed to want to
come into the flat even though the music had already been turned off.
Cameron, with an income of #40,000 a year, was well able to pay a
fine, said Mr Keenan.
She was due to travel to Australia in the next week or so and wanted
to put the whole matter behind her.

SCOTS families face an extra ''tap tax'', averaging #230, on their
water bills to pay for windfall profits to private operators brought in
to build new pipelines and treatment plants, Labour claimed yesterday.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said Boo schemes --
''build-own-operate'' projects by private industry under the
Government's Private Finance Initiative -- amounted to
semi-privatisation which would cost Scottish taxpayers dear.
A Labour campaign in the autumn will seek to add to the Scottish
political lexicon, with poll tax and tartan tax being joined by tap tax.
Mr Robertson said: ''Thanks to Tory dogma, Scots will have to pay
dearly for Michael Forsyth's water quangos. The man who gave you the
poll tax now gives you the tap tax. Why won't Michael Forsyth admit that
private financing is the most costly option?''
He pointed to a report by the Chemical Bank, consultants commissioned
by Strathclyde region as part of its water referendum campaign which
produced a 97% vote against privatisation.
This study estimated that the cost of financing a single sewage
treatment plant would rise from #201m under conventional public-sector
financing to #337m under a Boo scheme bringing in the private sector.
From this, Labour has estimated a Scotland-wide figure putting #230 on
the average domestic annual bill. ''How can the Scottish Secretary
justify this extra burden?'' asked Mr Robertson.
Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch dismissed Labour's criticism,
saying: ''Of course costs will increase -- there is a massive investment
programme to finance. Indeed, water charges in Scotland have already
gone up 76% in the last six years whilst under local government control
as a part of this programme.''
He added: ''This Government is committed to giving the customer a
better deal and, far from being expensive, the use of private finance
can be a cost- effective option. Value for money is a key principle of
the Private Finance Initiative.
''Strathclyde's arguments on Boo costs were shot down months ago. A
Scottish Office response to the regional council's study was placed in
the House of Commons last November.
''Of course, the huge investment programme can be funded through
additional public expenditure and the value for money option of private
finance ignored. But this would inevitably mean cuts in other services
like health and education. This Government is not prepared to expose the
Scottish people to that sort of Russian roulette.''

<TEXT>
NEWS of an unexpected financial time bomb ticking away in the
background was revealed to Strathclyde councillors yesterday.
Finance committee chairman John Mullin explained that a test case
covering more than 600 regional education staff, effectively seeking
payment for working as principal teachers, had gone before an industrial
tribunal.
''We have lost nine out of 10 cases and, if our appeal is not upheld,
there could possibly be back-dating for two years, which means a cost of
about #9m,'' he said. ''If the cases are lost and are held to come under
EC legislation, that could mean back dating for five years and a
potential cost of #24m.''
While the region was doing all it could to cope with the situation, it
could obviously have an effect on the new unitary authorities.
He further pointed out that recruitment procedures adopted by some of
the new unitary authorities was threatening a #12m package of savings on
staff costs built into the regional council's fraught budget process.
He explained that, in recruiting regional council staff, some new
authorities were making appointments but giving very late starting
dates, in some cases as late as January. This meant they remained longer
on the regional council's payroll than anticipated.
Councillor Mullin said: ''That is grossly unfair, to everyone
concerned. We are not prepared in the region to have to consider any
cuts as a result of that kind of attitude. We will have a meeting next
month with leaders of the new authorities to see that some people don't
try to play silly buggers. It is important that the real cost of local
government re-organisation is fully known and understood.''
Councillors had one item of consolation. Director of finance Archie
Gillespie indicated that poll tax and council tax monies were coming in
steadily. There could be a possible saving for taxpayers in the future,
as a result.

Earlier, two boys aged nine and 10 were released without charge after
being questioned over the death of Mrs Edna Condie, 74.
Her skull was shattered by the slab outside Grayson Heights in
Kirkstall, Leeds, as she returned from a shopping trip with her husband
George, 76, and daughter Janet, 43.
Leeds council housing officials said they were investigating reports
that other heavy objects had been thrown from buildings in the area.
They also have promised to look at security .

<TEXT>
AN appeal has been lodged at the High Court in Edinburgh alleging that
a sheriff fell asleep on the bench during a trial.
Sheriff John Dean is alleged to have been snoozing during evidence in
a reckless driving case at Ayr Sheriff Court.
Yesterday, solicitor Gerry Tierney said his client Andrew Frew had
instructed him to lodge an appeal against his conviction on the grounds
that Sheriff Dean was ''manifestly asleep'' during the evidence.
After the trial, Sheriff Dean found Frew, 25, of Beechwood Avenue,
Auchinleck, guilty. He fined him #250 and banned him from driving for
one year.
However, it is being alleged that Sheriff Dean was asleep while Mr
Tierney was cross-examining one of the Crown witnesses.
During the trial, police said they had clocked Frew in Cumnock going
from 0-80mph in 0.2 miles. They were in an unmarked police car and when
they signalled Frew to stop he ignored them. The officers said that Frew
sped off through the streets of Cumnock and they did not catch him.
In his defence, Frew said his Vauxhall Nova was not capable of going
from 0-80mph in 0.2 miles. He said the officers were in plain clothes in
the unmarked car. He added that he had no intention of stopping in
Cumnock in the early hours of the morning for strangers in a strange
car.
Mr Tierney said yesterday he was asking for the conviction to be
quashed through a bill of suspension.
''A bill of suspension has been framed and is being lodged before the
High Court in Edinburgh on the grounds that the sheriff was manifestly
asleep during the trial.''
He added: ''This is an unusual legal step since normally an appeal
against conviction in a Sheriff Court is only by stated case but because
the sheriff was said to be asleep during the course of the trial and
therefore would not be in a position to put forward a full stated case,
counsel take the view that a bill of suspension should be framed and
lodged instead.''

<TEXT>
A GROUP of crofters wants the Scottish Office to take the
unprecedented step of allowing protected golden eagles to be shot.
They claim ''rogue'' eagles are ravaging their sheep flocks in the
Outer Hebrides.
The crofters' spokesman, Western Isles councillor Colin Campbell, said
yesterday: ''There is no other explanation than eagles for our massive
losses of lambs this year.
''We all know eagles are the cause. But the powers that be do not like
to acknowledge it. The green lobby is very strong.''
Mr Campbell, from Benbecula, is one of five crofters with ground at
distant Nunton Hill on the remote east side of the island who have
signed a letter to the Scottish Office's Department of Agriculture
asking for a shooting licence to be issued.
Failing that, they should be compensated for their losses. Copies of
the letter have been sent to the Crofters Commission and Scottish
Natural Heritage.
Councillor Campbell said he would have expected about 60 lambs from
his 80-85 ewes this year. Instead, only 15 have survived. His four
colleagues whose ground is also a considerable distance from their
homes, were in a similar plight.
He claimed there had been an increase in the golden eagle population
in the rugged east side of Benbecula.''This increase is in proportion to
the increase in our lamb losses,'' he said. ''They are large, powerful
birds easily able to carry off lambs.
Mr John Love, of the local Scottish Natural Heritage Office,
said:''It's far too easy for the crofters to lay the blame for their
lamb losses at the door of the eagles. It might be a rogue eagle or
equally a red herring.
''As far as I'm aware, a licence has never been issued to cull golden
eagles. There is not a particularly high density of them in Uist,
Benbecula, and Barra -- about 16 to 18 pairs.''
Mr Stuart Benn, of the RSPB office in Inverness, said: ''A few years
ago, the crofters in Glenelg near Skye came up with similar claims and
wanted eagles shot. But a closer examination showed that their lamb
losses could not all be explained away by blaming eagles.''
However, he added: ''Nobody is saying eagles never take lambs. But it
could well be weak ones which were going to die anyway from the cold or
whatever. And if an eagle has been seen feeding on one, it may have
already died from some other reason. There are a whole range of
possibilities.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said yesterday: ''We received this letter
from the crofters in the past day or two. We are offering them a meeting
with representatives from the Department of Agriculture and Scottish
Natural Heritage.''

TO the strains of You'll Never Walk Alone, Robbie Gee and Paul Barker,
the two Merseyside schoolboys who went on a fishing trip to a local
beauty spot and were later found stabbed to death, were taken to their
final resting places yesterday.
Gerry Marsden, who recorded the Liverpool football song, was among
those who sent wreaths to the funeral service at St David's Church in
the quiet little community of Eastham, just across the river from
Liverpool.
Robbie, in particular, was a Liverpool supporter and one of his
heroes, John Aldridge, was among the mourners. The number nine jersey of
another of his heroes, Ian Rush, was among the items which adorned the
altar, banked with orange, yellow and cream flowers.
Shops closed and crowds lined the streets as Robbie's cortege came
down from Darleydale Drive, towards Paul's home at Raeburn Avenue and
the two hearses came side by side as they approached the church. On the
way, they paused by South Wirral High School, where the boys should have
resumed their studies next week.
Lennie and Kathryn Gee came with the coffin of their only child.
Richard and Pat Barker comforted their 11-year-old daughter, Hannah, as
they all joined hands for the funeral of the inseparable friends.
It is hard to fit a tragedy which shocked the nation into the mundane
setting of a community which we would all recognise. Eastham, once a
picturesque village known for its ferry which plied across the Mersey to
Liverpool, is now an attractive surburban area. Avenues run into wooded
beauty spots like that where Robbie, 12, and Paul, 13, had gone that
last Saturday in July at the start of the school holidays.
They had set out on their mountain bikes for the kind of innocent
fishing trip which would reassure most parents at a time when the safety
of their youngsters has become the paramount consideration.
When they had not come home by teatime, their fathers began their own
search and then reported them missing. First the police found the boys'
fishing tackle, still set up by a pond. Early next morning they found
Robbie's body, with knife wounds, lying under some trees. That afternoon
they found Paul's body on the banks of another pond, about 500 yards
away.
Yesterday the minister of St David's United Reformed Church, Dr Peter
Foster, led the tributes to the two lads, along with Bishop Alan
Winstanley.
As they played a recording of Everyday by Phil Collins -- a favourite
of both boys -- Dr Foster recalled that Paul had been especially
thrilled to be at one of the star's recent concerts. He was an
easy-going lad whose best birthday present had been membership of the
fishing club. Paul was a keen member of the Boys' Brigade in the church.
Ironically, it was his grandfather, 77-year-old William Barker, who
introduced him to the sport he came to love so much -- the sport that
lead to his tragic end.
Robbie was the football enthusiast, supporting both Liverpool and
Tranmere Rovers. There were tales of pranks and good-natured mischief as
well as love and caring.
Bishop Winstanley said: ''Robbie and Paul had many happy times
together, they lived their lives together and lived them to the full.
They are still together.''
Dr Foster told the parents: ''In your very action of bringing your
boys together to this place, you are declaring to the communities of
Eastham and Bromborough, perhaps even to our nation, that the real
values in life lie in the mutual responsibility which they shared, in
the deep and lasting friendships which they forged along with others
present today, of life lived and enjoyed to the full in family and
community.
''Your vision of a place of safety and of beauty for the community and
for its children, to be enabled by the trust fund which you have asked
to be set up, will I believe be a sign of hope in our midst.''
In a highly-charged service a crowded congregation sang Oh Love That
Wilt Not Let Me Go before WPC Joanne Johnson, who counselled the
families, read the famous poem by Henry Scott Holland, about death
taking you merely into the next room.
A teenage girl, Rebecca Gentry, who lost a friend in another tragedy,
sent a poem, God Will Look After You, My Dear. The headmaster of the
boys' school, Mr Wynn Francis, read the 23rd Psalm, The Lord's My
Shepherd.
As the coffins emerged from the church to begin their separate
journeys, Kathryn Gee clutched a single red rose and little Hannah
Barker clung to her teddy bear.
Paul's cortege headed for private cremation at Blacon, while Robbie's
went along the road to Plymard Cemetery. As they lowered his coffin his
mother cast the single rose into the grave.
The wreaths which lay around included one from schoolfriends, two of
which were shaped as footballs and one in the form of a fish,
symbolising not only the boys' favourite pastime but Christianity
itself.
Now there was a weeping in the summer wind for two young lives, wasted
and gone forever. No sense in this. No logic, prompting thoughts of what
has gone wrong with the world. Just two small coffins -- and two
families soon to know the loneliness of an everlasting private grief
when public sympathy and concern have moved on to the next unthinkable
tragedy . . . and the next.
* Mr Steven Heaney, 36, of Sutherland Drive, Eastham, has been charged
with both murders. He was twice remanded and is due to appear in court
again on September 12.

LADY Jane Grosvenor, former wife of the Duke of Roxburghe, has sold
the Scottish estate she bought after her divorce and is moving south to
be nearer her children, who are at school in England.
Rangers footballer Paul Gascoigne was widely rumoured to be interested
in 534-acre Cherrytrees, near the Roxburghshire village of Yetholm,
earlier this summer at a price estimated at more than #2m.
However, yesterday the Edinburgh office of agent Knight Frank &amp; Rutley
said Cherrytrees had been sold to Mr Edward Devereux, a British-born
businessmen based in Asia whose mother's family originates from the
Borders.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley partner Mr Colin Strang-Steel said: ''I cannot
reveal the price -- that is a private matter. But Mr Devereux intends to
make Cherrytrees his family home and will take over early in the new
year.''
Lady Jane, sister of the Duke of Westminster, one of the wealthiest
men in Britain, has entertained members of the royal family at
Cherrytrees, including the Duke and Duchess of York.
The extensively restored Georgian Cherrytrees mansion has four
reception rooms, a billiards room, six bedrooms, and four bathrooms. The
estate includes a working farm, manager's bungalow, four cottages, and a
pheasant shoot.

ONE of the companies which advised Highland Health Board on building a
#2m headquarters in Inverness was receiving a retainer from Morrison
Construction Group until a few weeks before beginning work for the
board.
The chairman of Morrison, Mr Fraser Morrison, confirmed last night
that Neil Munro Property Consultancy of Glasgow had been paid for its
services in property development in the Central belt.
Mr Morrison insisted it was exclusively concerned with his company's
work in the Central area and the relationship had ended before there was
any involvement with the health board. ''I can't help or dictate who he
goes to work for next,'' Mr Morrison said.
Mr Munro confirmed this last night. He said Morrison's had terminated
his contract in April 1994.
A health board spokesman said: ''The firm had been sub-contracted to
advise the board on property disposal. They had been taken on by the
board's advisers, Faithful and Gould of Edinburgh, who were hired in May
1994. We were not aware that they had previously been in receipt of a
retainer from Morrison's.''
The Morrison Group and Highland Health Board categorically denied the
company had last summer received the specification for the board's #2m
headquarters in Inverness two weeks before competitors, a contract the
firm subsequently won.
The chairmen of both were the subject of a Scottish Office inquiry
last week. This cleared both Mr Morrison and Mr John Robertson, also
chairman of the North of Scotland Water Authority, following The
Herald's report that Morrison's had been given the specification and
lodged a planning application for the water authority's new HQ before
competitors had even seen the specification.
Mr Morrison is also chairman of Highlands and Islands Enterprise,
while Mr Robertson is an HIE board member as well as being chairman of
the health board.
Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch was convinced Morrison's had
not been given ''an inside track'' on the contract. Both Morrison's and
the health board insisted yesterday the same was true in the case of the
health board HQ.
Mr Morrison said: ''We can absolutely and categorically deny that we
ever received the specification documents before competitors. We have
checked this back and forward. We only received these on August 12 like
anybody else.''
Mr John Robertson also issued a statement in which he ''refuted that
Morrison's received any advance for information or preferential
treatment''.

BRITAIN and Ireland were still trying to reach agreement last night on
moves to set up an international commission to take charge of proposals
for IRA disarmament.
The Prime Minister and Irish Premier John Bruton will meet next
Wednesday, when they hope officials in London and Dublin will have
negotiated some sort of arrangement aimed at moving towards the start of
decommissioning.
With the first anniversary of the IRA ceasefire coming at midnight,
Downing Street is still resisting Sinn Fein pressure to allow republican
representatives into all-party negotiations ahead of any moves towards
the handing over of guns.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Sinn Fein president
Gerry Adams are expected to have talks within the next few days.
No date has been agreed but with Mr Martin McGuinness, a key member of
the party's negotiating team, due to leave for the United States next
Tuesday, both sides are anxious for a meeting before then.
Republican demands on Britain to fix a time for the start of all-party
talks will intensify over the next 24 hours, as thousands prepare to
take to the streets for a series of ceasefire anniversary demonstrations
and protest rallies.
The republic's Foreign Minister, Mr Dick Spring, confirmed in Dublin
yesterday that next Wednesday's summit will go ahead, after fears it
might have to be postponed because of a failure to reach agreement on
the disarmament commission.
According to Mr Spring, the two Governments are very close to arriving
at conclusions on their difficulties.
It is understood that Mr Major and Mr Bruton have spoken briefly on
the telephone as part of the preparations for that meeting and, although
no agreement has yet been reached on proposals for the independent
commission, the Prime Minister is likely to face fresh pressure from
Dublin to get the round-table negotiations on Northern Ireland's future
started as soon as possible.
Mr Adams has already warned of a potential crisis in the peace process
if, at their next meeting, Sir Patrick refuses Sinn Fein demands for the
start of inclusive dialogue.
Mr Spring yesterday spoke of the republic's frustration that all sides
were no closer to all- party talks.
However, he added: ''In fairness, there are obstacles to those talks
and we have to remove those obstacles.''
Mr Spring told Irish radio that the timing of the summit was important
because of the IRA ceasefire anniversary.
''From our point of view, we want to see the issues that are on the
table tackled,'' he said.
''There are many issues, such as decommissioning of weapons, the
prisoners, reform of police, and emergency legislation review. All of
these are on the agenda.''
He said much work had been done on the question of an international
commission to oversee the decommissioning of arms.
In the United States, President Clinton yesterday called on all
parties to the conflict in Northern Ireland to sit down for peace talks
and address the issue of decommissioning weapons.
''On this anniversary, I urge the parties to build on the important
work of the past year to secure a just and lasting settlement to a
conflict that has cost so many lives,'' he said.
The President, referring to his planned visit to Northern Ireland at
the end of November, said he hoped peace talks would start before then.
Meanwhile, it emerged that the battle for leadership of the Ulster
Unionist Party could be a five-cornered fight.
Upper Bann MP David Trimble confirmed yesterday that he was under
pressure to stand.
South Belfast MP, the Rev Martin Smyth, East Londonderry MP William
Ross, and Fermanagh/South-Tyrone MP Ken Maginnis already have started
their campaigns to take over the leadership following Mr James
Molyneaux's resignation.
Mr John Taylor, MP for Strangford, who is the favourite to win the
leadership, still has to confirm his candidacy.

A JUDGE has reluctantly accepted that he cannot force the Royal Bank
of Scotland to keep open a branch in Glasgow's Sauchiehall Centre,
although the bank is in breach of the terms of its lease.
Lord Coulsfield's decision could have far-reaching implications for
developers who fear the viability of shopping centres will be damaged by
businesses who pull out leaving behind ''black holes''.
The terms of yesterday's ruling seem to indicate that the courts have
very limited powers to stop this happening, even if the lease has been
breached.
Lord Coulsfield decided that he could not frame a court order specific
enough to be enforced by the owners of the Sauchiehall Centre, Retail
Parks Investments.
Retail Parks' only remaining remedy may be to sue the Royal Bank for
damages.
In a written judgment issued in the Court of Session, Lord Coulsfield
said the original lease for the premises to be used as bank offices was
entered into in August 1977 and ran until August 2002 at a rent of
#129,000 a year.
However, in March this year the bank decided that, although it would
still be liable for the rent, it no longer wished to occupy and use the
premises. It intended to open a new branch, about 500 yards from the
centre..
Two cash machines would stay open for customers at the Sauchiehall
Centre.
Retail Parks wanted the bank to keep the shopping centre branch open
and Lord Coulsfield said the question was whether the law enabled it to
achieve that.
The bank argued that, on a proper interpretation of the lease, the
move out of the centre did not amount to a breach of contract.
The requirement that the premises be kept open involved no more than
an obligation that business be transacted, and if business was
transacted by means of auto-tellers, that was enough.
Retail Parks argued that, even in this day and age, it would be
difficult to regard the term ''offices'' as applying to a place where
there were no members of staff.
Lord Coulsfield said he had little difficulty in rejecting the bank's
argument that the provision of two cash machines was sufficient to
comply with the terms of the lease.
However, he said that under Scots law it was a good objection to an
action of this kind that the court order sought could not possibly be
enforced.
Lord Coulsfield decided that the bank's argument must prevail.
He added: ''I reach this conclusion with some regret since I think
that this is a commercial contract in which the parties' intentions can
be ascertained with reasonable clarity.''

ARCHBISHOP Keith O'Brien, who offended war veterans during a VJ
service when he criticised some of the action of the allies and the
dropping of the atomic bomb, has apologised to them in an open letter to
The Herald.
The comments by Archbishop O'Brien which sparked the controversy were
made at the memorial service at St Giles in Edinburgh attended by the
Princess Royal and Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth 11 days ago.
During his sermon, Archbishop O'Brien, who is Catholic Archbishop of
St Andrews and Edinburgh, upset some of the congregation with his views
on the destruction of Dresden, the bombing of Tokyo, and the atomic bomb
attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
By stating that they were seen as ''dramatic examples of a readiness
to treat civilians as though they were enemy soldiers'' he provoked
fierce criticism from old soldiers who attended.
Even Mr Forsyth became involved when he told the veterans afterwards
that if the bomb had not been dropped many of the people represented at
VJ services up and down the country that day would have lost their
lives.
In his letter, Archbishop O'Brien apologised if he had upset anyone
but states later that, as a preacher, it was not his role to try to
please anyone but to preach the truth as he saw it.
He says he renewed his appreciation of the valiant veterans of the
Second World War for all their efforts and expressed his horror at the
thought of the suffering they endured.
He adds: ''I apologise sincerely to any who may have been upset --
certainly no insult was intended to any veterans . . .''
He said he had ''followed his conscience'' during his sermon, which he
now understood had upset veterans of the ''forgotten war'' in the Far
East.

FEARFUL workers at the Yarrow warship yard in Glasgow last night
likened the resignation of managing director Murray Easton to a captain
abandoning a sinking ship.
Mr Easton's announcement coincided with the most crucial period yet in
the 130-yearhistory of Yarrow, as the 3000workforce awaits a decision on
a multi-million pound bid to build three frigates for the Royal Navy.
Many homeward-bound workers were alarmed by Mr Easton's timing, on
grounds that he will know ''better than anyone else'' what the future
holds for one of Scotland's largest single manufacturing sites.
It would appear that the Type 23 orders will be won but that Yarrow
traditions, customs, and practices -- already the subject of industrial
strife in recent years -- face oblivion.
One favoured scenario for the departure of Mr Easton, who took over
from his father Sir Bob Easton in 1991, is that he is haunted by
personality clashes involving highly profit-motivated and tough managers
within the new parent company, GEC.
In June, he publicly signalled doubts by declaring that GEC's
subsequent takeover of Trident submarine builder VSEL was ''a point of
concern'' for Yarrow, especially if rationalisation followed.
However, last month's return to GEC of Mr Brian George to head up its
Yarrow and VSEL subsidiaries was perhaps even more significant.
Where before Mr Easton was directly responsible to the managing
director of GEC-Marconi, he now reports to Mr George, who oversaw
construction of the Sizewell B nuclear power station.
It is understood GEC is determined to overcome a perceived ''dripping
roast'' mentality at Yarrow, Scotland's only warship builder, and wants
to expand from defence contracts into other lucrative shipbuilding
areas.
Mr Easton declined to comment yesterday and a Yarrow spokesman said
there would be no statement on what was ''an internal, personal
matter''.
After meeting the board and local management, Mr Easton, 44, told
union officials he was resigning for strictly personal reasons. Married
with three children, he wanted to spend more time with his family after
years of trawling the world for orders.
That cut little ice with one Labour MP in the area, who suspected Mr
Easton was pushed out by owners who want a bigger share of non-military
work and are disillusioned by the yard's abysmal industrial relations in
recent years.
Mr Easton's departure, on a date to be determined, will end the Easton
dynasty at Yarrow, which dates back to the fifties.
It is understood Mr Easton already has job offers -- one, according to
insiders, with a water industry company based in Aberdeen and working
offshore, another with a developer who is aiming to build a major
shopping complex in the Glasgow area.
Although Mr Easton's travels to drum up business are widely
acknowledged by the workforce, many will not be sorry to see him go.
In 1993, changes in working practices by head-hunted managers led the
yard to its first all-out strike for 20 years.
No successor has been named but difficult times ahead are promised
regardless of who it is. Even if Yarrow wins the #200m frigates order in
November, it will not come in time to prevent workers being laid off
because of a work gap.
Mr Dougie Conroy, convener of shop stewards, warned that if the order
was not forthcoming then ''the writing is on the wall'' for Yarrow.
Hillhead MP George Galloway, whose constituency embraces the yard,
disagreed. He said: ''I am as surprised as anyone else at the
resignation but feel sure that the ship will sail on.''
Although nothing could be guaranteed in the current climate, Mr
Galloway was confident Yarrow would secure the frigates because of the
workforce's proven expertise and quality, equal to anything in the
world.
Mr Tony Worthington, MP for Clydebank and Milngavie, said: ''The
resignation is worrying at a time when all efforts have to go into
winning the orders, crucial to Yarrow's future. I hope GEC will ensure
everything remains in place to win.''
The yard is due to finish work on five ships next year. After that,
the order book is empty.
It is not known if Mr Easton will depart before November from Yarrow,
whose first ship was built on the Thames in 1865, before it moved to
Clydebank in 1907.

LORD Waldegrave, brother of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, was
arrested after his wife claimed he tried to kill her.
The 54-year-old farmer, who was has been released on bail, said
yesterday that his marriage was ''on the rocks''.
His sister, Lady Jane Howard, said he told police the allegation was
''complete bunkum'' after he voluntarily went for questioning on
Tuesday. She added: ''I can tell you the marriage is in fact ending. It
is very sad.''
Lord Waldegrave, whose brother, William, has a farmhouse near his
Somerset home, has been married to Lady Mary Waldegrave for nine years.
The couple spoke to reporters yesterday at the family seat of Chewton
House, Chewton Mendip.
They said they were seeking a permanent separation, as Lord Waldegrave
admitted: ''Our marriage is on the rocks.'' Nobody else was involved.
He said his wife's allegations of threats were denied but he declined
to talk in detail about the incident. ''I think you might find it was
something of a joke.''
Lady Waldegrave, who posed for photographs with sons Riversdale, six,
and Edward, eight, said: ''I would not have called the police out twice
if he was joking.''
She claimed her husband prevented her trying to leave with the
children for London. That was the first occasion she called the police,
she said.
Police were present on a later date when again she tried to leave, she
alleged.
Over the past few years, she and Lord Waldegrave increasingly had been
leading separate lives, she added. ''We are now seeking a permanent
separation.''
He said: ''We are having what you might call marital difficulties and
our marriage is in the hands of solicitors.''
He said he had told his younger brother of his arrest. Mr Waldegrave
recently returned to his farmhouse following a holiday in Spain.
Lord Waldegrave would not talk further to reporters, saying his mother
was seriously ill in Chewton House.
In the village of Chewton Mendip, a former tenant of Lord Waldegrave's
father described the present lord as a ''likeable landlord''.
Mr Arthur Green, who is in his 70s, passed his 400-acre holding on to
his son, who is a tenant of Lord Waldegrave. Mr Green said the arrest
''came as a shock, a real shock''.
He added: ''He is a very likeable person, very calm, and very
businesslike. Of course he spends some time down here and some time in
London, so we don't see a lot of him.
''He has always been a likeable potential landlord and landlord. He
has always fitted in very well in the village and he has been very well
liked.''
One member of the village community, who asked not to be named, said
he saw Lord Waldegrave driving with his children yesterday in an
open-topped car.
''He looked his normal self and quite happy. We see him around the
village a bit but generally he keeps himself to himself. This is a real
surprise.''

AN IRISH Army officer was missing last night as one of five European
Union observers feared killed during the Nato air strikes in Bosnia.
A spokesman at the Irish Defence Forces' headquarters in Dublin said:
''The location of all our personnel in the former Yugoslavia is being
checked.
''But we are seriously concerned about the safety of one of our
officers.''
A European Commission spokesman said the five missing personnel,
members of a monitoring mission delegation in Bosnia, were: Irishman
James Gibbon; Spanish charge d'affaires to Belgrade, Fernando Sanchez
Rau: his number two, Jose Luis Esponera; fellow Spaniard Zenon Luis
Crinfan; and Dutchman Peter Schoonenwolf.
However, the spokesman emphasised that while the five were missing he
could not confirm reports from EU sources in Croatia that they were
dead.
''We know they were in Bosnian Serb territory but we don't know why
they were there,'' he said.
Nineteen Irish Army personnel are serving in the former Yugoslavia
with a variety of international organisations.
EU sources in Zagreb said earlier that five officials had been killed
in Serb-held territory outside Sarajevo during the Nato air strikes.
External Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek said bodies that had
been found could not be identified at this stage.
''It is not clear how the bodies that have been found got where they
were,'' he said.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth is understood to be preparing an
approach to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a bid to gain tax breaks
for the Scottish -- and UK -- film industry.
Mr Forsyth, who will host a private dinner for Hollywood executives
and representatives of the Scottish film industry at Edinburgh Castle
this weekend, is keen to ensure that what happened with Braveheart --
where filming was moved from Scotland to Ireland because of tax
incentives offered by the Irish Government -- is never repeated.
Mel Gibson's historical epic about William Wallace receives its
European premiere at a star-studded event in Stirling on Sunday night.
Mr Forsyth has already expressed his desire to assist the country's
burgeoning movie business and encourage more film makers to use Scotland
as a location. The dinner is seen as his first tangible step in that
direction and he intends to use it as a chance to listen to the views of
industry chiefs.
Over the past year American film makers have been attracted to
Scotland with three big-budget movies. The Scottish Office, aware that
the movie business brings much-needed jobs to Scotland as well as giving
a boost to the tourism industry, is anxious to ensure that the window of
opportunity is not squandered.
However, it is not simply the occasional blockbuster that Mr Forsyth
wants to attract. It is understood that he wants to help local film
makers as much as possible.
Mr Forsyth is aware, however, that the Government's current tax laws
act as a barrier for major film companies, and that they are turning to
the less expensive and more user-friendly Irish Republic.
With this in mind he looks set to press the Government, in particular
Chancellor Kenneth Clark, to make the tax situation more attractive for
film makers.
Meanwhile Sunday's glittering premiere of Braveheart faces disruption
from angry locals who claim they have been snubbed.
Up to 700 celebrities and guests -- including Mel Gibson and other
members of the cast -- are expected to attend a party at Stirling Castle
after the screening.
But angry members of the local community are threatening to demand
entry to the party by invoking an ancient ''right of access'' law.
They claim the law -- thought to date back to the fifteenth century --
states that 'all sons and daughters born of Stirling rock' have the
right to enter the castle at any time.
Yesterday a spokesman for Historic Scotland -- castle custodians --
said: ''As far as we're concerned 20th Century-Fox have hired the castle
from us and what they do afterwards is entirely up to them.''
* TORIES sought to cast a cloud over SNP efforts to cash in on the
fervour surrounding Braveheart by claiming that party leader Alex
Salmond had made ''crass and irresponsible'' comments about
''decapitating'' Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Mr Salmond's jocular remarks came at last weekend's Wallace memorial
ceremony at Dunnottar Castle near Stonehaven, when he told nationalists:
''We shall being going to the premiere of Braveheart in Stirling. It
should be an interesting do, that. We are going to decapitate Michael
Forsyth at the intermission.''
However, his joke fell flat with Conservatives who heard it on TV, and
yesterday party president Sir Michael Hirst claimed Mr Salmond should
apologise for the remarks.

AS Nato warplanes and artillery pounded Serb targets across Bosnia
yesterday, the UN gave the Serbian military leader three demands before
the bombing could stop.
General Ratko Mladic was told he must withdraw his guns from a 12-mile
exclusion zone around Sarajevo, accept a ceasefire, and not attack the
Muslim enclaves of Gorazde and Tuzla, UN-declared safe areas.
The demands came from French General Bernard Janvier, the overall UN
commander.
The immediate reaction from General Mladic was one of rejection, at
least on his guns at Sarajevo. ''There can be no question about such
matters via fax messages. We shall remain in our positions.''
However, the pressure on Mladic could soon also come from his allies.
US assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke last night won support
for his peace plan from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Mr Milosevic said it ''creates a real perspective for peace, and has
all the elements that could guarantee peace and the protection of
interests of all the warring sides.''
His office last night issued a statement saying he and Bosnian Serb
leaders had agreed to ''harmonise completely their approach to the peace
process.'' Under pressure from Mr Milosevic, Bosnian Serb leaders have
''welcomed'' the US initiative, and named Mr Milosevic to negotiate on
their behalf with other warring leaders at any expected peace
conference.
Hoever, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was making an appearance
of defiance. He said his people would stand firm and would triumph in
the end.
''Find the pilots, find the pilots,'' he shouted from a window in the
TV station in Pale when he learned one of the aircraft, a French Mirage
2000N, had been shot down by a SAM-7 missile.
Despite his defiance, the reality was that his people were facing
Nato's most powerful ever military action.
The initial raids, according to the Pentagon, had hit the desired
targets. Deputy Defence Secretary John White said: ''We have preliminary
indications that a substantial number of targets were damaged, heavily
in many cases.''
A spokesman at Nato's southern command in Naples, nerve centre of the
operation which began shortly after midnight with a bombing raid around
the besieged capital of Sarajevo, said that by mid-afternoon more than
200 sorties had been flown.
Bombs and rockets rained down around the Serb stronghold of Pale in a
fourth wave of attacks in late afternoon as Nato redoubled efforts to
knock out air defences and destroy artillery that can target the four UN
safe areas of Bosnia.
The one setback was the downing of the French jet. Nato sources said
they were trying to establish if the two crew survived. US officials
said two parachutes were seen in the sky.
The Nato air attacks hit Serb-held radar, missile and communications
sites from near Tuzla in the north to around Mostar in the south in a
bid to cripple air defences.
British, French and Dutch artillery joined the assault around
Sarajevo, firing about 600 rounds against Bosnian Serb gun emplacements
and ammunition dumps.
A UN spokesman called it a ''truly defining moment'' for the UN
mission in Bosnia. The wholesale assault went vastly further than nine
previous ''pinprick'' bombing operations by the alliance.
General Janvier said the first attacks had significantly reduced the
threat Serb artillery posed to Sarajevo but the campaign would go on
until heavy weapons were forced out of range of the city.
Bosnian government leaders welcomed the Nato action as a step towards
peace and Western politicians deemed it an inevitable response after
Serbs were found guilty of firing a mortar round that killed 37 people
in Sarajevo on Monday.
''The Bosnian Serbs, especially after the events of the last 12 hours,
ought to have concluded that there is no military victory in sight for
them, the tide of the war has turned against them,'' US State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
''Their dream of a greater Serbia is no more, it's time to face the
responsibility of peace,'' he told CNN television.
However, Russian President Boris Yeltsin attacked the raids as a
''cruel bombardment''.
More than 60 aircraft operating from bases in Italy and the carrier
USS Theodore Roosevelt took part in the first two raids, which struck
near Sarajevo, Tuzla, Gorazde, and Mostar.
Flashes lit up the night sky behind the mountains from which Bosnian
Serb forces have ringed the Bosnian capital for the past 40 months,
shelling its people at will.
Residents of the city, who had long despaired of any decisive military
intervention to relieve their misery, watched the clouds of black smoke
rise over Pale with amazement.
Some staged an impromptu early morning carnival as news came through
on their radios that Nato had begun its attacks. By contrast, streets in
Pale were largely deserted as people stayed in shelters.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic praised the strikes. ''We see this
not as the beginning of war, but the beginning of peace,'' he said in
Paris, where he met with French leaders. ''The world has finally done
what it should have done a long, long time ago.''
British Ministers are braced for possible Serb retaliation on UN
troops. Defence Secretary Michael Portillo said: ''We have gone into
this with our eyes open.'' He admitted retaliation was a possibility,
but the UN and Nato were aware that if they did nothing ''the slaughter
of civilians in Sarajevo would continue.''
Labour left-wingers Tony Benn and Tam Dalyell have asked the Speaker,
Miss Betty Boothroyd, to recall Parliament, mainly because Britain and
the other Nato forces had not consulted the Russians.
