NOW that Parliament has decided that MPs must declare all their income
associated with their parliamentary duties, is it not time that the
Labour people who have promoted this in Parliament should be demanding
similar steps for local government?
For a number of councillors this is a bonanza year with allowances
from regional councils, new unitary authorities, greatly increased
special responsibility allowances from the new unitary authorities, and
with more than a fair sprinkling of income from quangos such as New Town
development corporations thrown in for good measure.
Many, of course, are teachers and social workers with a salary in
addition to their council incomes, allowances, and expenses.

RARELY if ever have I found myself so wholly in agreement as when I
read Michael Bernard's Herald Essay (November 4).
Here is an honest examination of our economic and employment problems;
a perfect analysis that takes account of the expansionism which
contributed to our bloody century. Here are humane, workable solutions
gleaned from Europe's industrial history and experience.
Here is a businessman with an honourable and unselfish vision of New
Europe, and indeed for the world, in the third millennium. Michael
Bernard's wise words should be prescribed reading for every politician.

<HEADLINE>Glass should be fit for Dons' trip to Ibrox. Aitken plans to halt Rangers' title charge</HEADLINE>

ROY Aitken believes Aberdeen can tomorrow put the brakes on Rangers'
runaway bid for their eight successive premier division title. The Ibrox
side, with 10 wins from their opening 12 games, have made their best
ever start to a championship campaign.
But the Dons beat Rangers in a Coca-Cola Cup semi-final last month and
Aitken is optmistic that his side can achieve another crucial result,
this time in the league, at Ibrox. They trail the champions by 12
points, but Aitken insists: ''There will be a lot of hype because we
played so well in beating them the last time we met. That result -- and
the fact that we have played some of our best football this season in
our meetings with Rangers -- means we can approach this trip in a
positive frame of mind.
''The match presents my players with another major challenge, but they
will get a lift out of the occasion. They prefer the bigger stages with
capacity crowds, and so do our supporters.''
But Aitken has injury problems for a game the Dons cannot afford to
lose. Teenager Stephen Glass was taken off at half-time in the midweek
win over Falkirk with a knee injury and striker Scott Booth was
sidelined with a calf strain.
Aitken added: ''We decided to rest Booth to try and clear up this
niggling injury, but it will be touch and go. Glass was replaced purely
as a precautionary measure, so that he could be treated immediately and
avoid unnecessary swelling in his knee. I believe he will be fit.
''However, we fell below our standards in beating Falkirk. If we are
to be successful it is important that we combine performances and
results.
''The only time we were threatened was through our own slackness. The
points were valuable, but we have played better and lost this season.''
Meanwhile, Aberdeen defender Brian Irvine continued his comeback
yesterday by scoring for the reserves in their 4-0 win over Hibs at
Easter Road.
Hibs defender Graham Mitchell and midfielder Mickey Weir both played
the full 90 minutes as they continued their bid for full fitness.
* KILMARNOCK'S Tom Brown, who limped off after just 26 minutes in the
2-0 midweek defeat by Rangers, will be sidelined for two weeks with a
calf injury.
Rugby Park manager Alex Totten said: ''It looks as though Tom will be
out for 10 to 14 days. It's a blow to us, because he has been in very
good form recently.''
Despite the disappointment of losing two late goals, Totten was
delighted with the performances of his young players.
''Colin Meldrum did very well in goal and thoroughly deserved all the
praise he received,'' said Totten. ''His handling was excellent, and
when we put Gary Holt on as a substitute, we had six players aged 23 or
under.
''People moan about Scottish football and how it doesn't let young
talent come through, but I think that match disproved it. Rangers also
had young Colin Scott in goal.
''We'll have Dragoje Lekovic back from suspension for tomorrow's game
at Hearts, but I'll wait until nearer the kick-off before making any
decision on who plays.''
* FALKIRK keeper Tony Parks last night described his performance
against Aberdeen as inexcusable.
The veteran gifted Dons striker Billy Dodds a goal after only three
minutes and things got worse for Parks and his team-mates when they went
on to lose 3-1, a result which leaves them bottom of the premer
division.
However, Parks, back after a four-match absence, did not look for
excuses. He said: ''I think I was trying too hard to impress after being
out so long with a hamstring injury.
''I just wanted to get a quiet start to the game, but I hurried my
clearance and it ended up in the net. It was completely unprofessional
and inexcusable.''
Parks insisted he would bounce back from his mistake, but admitted his
confidence took a bit of a bashing.
''It's not a nice feeling hearing 10,000 people shouting abuse at you.
But you can't let a setback like that affect you. I've made mistakes
before and I will make them again.''
* JOHN Colquhoun's move to Airdire has been put on hold. Hearts
manager Jim Jefferies accepted a bid by the first division side earlier
this week, but Airdrie's Alex McDonald said: ''There are a couple of
problems which we can't do much about.
''I can't say too much about the position, but I'm still hopeful John
will sign for us.''
* BERWICK Rangers, who have lost their last two matches, will be
forced to field a makeshift side for tomorrow's match against Clyde at
Shielfield.
With nine of his 11-strong first-team squad on the injured list,
manager Tom Hendrie admitted: ''It will have to be a patch-up job.

<HEADLINE>Ferguson's men told, says Farry. SFA's advice had no appeal</HEADLINE>

IF HIS advisers had followed the advice of the SFA, Duncan Ferguson
could have been playing again by Christmas, rather than having to wait
until late January, according to chief executive Jim Farry. ''There was
no guarantee, of course, but they were told that if the appeal had been
dropped when the player was sentenced in court, the likelihood is that
the disciplinary committee would have instituted the ban from the first
available date.''
That, in effect, would have meant the Everton striker missing seven
games during his term in Barlinnie. As he had already served one game of
the 12-match ban he would then have been left with four to miss when he
left jail later this month and, as he will certainly need time to
recover match fitness, the Scottish internationalist would have been
ready just about the same time as his football ban was completed.
''The player's advisors chose not to follow that counsel,'' said Farry
who was also anxious to point out that the appeals' tribunal, which
rejected his protest on Wednesday, is not an SFA body as such. ''This
was an independent tribunal set up by the association at the behest of
the clubs, among whom Rangers were a leading light. The decision is full
and binding upon all parties; there is no further appeal.''
The SFA leader also wished to make the point that the tribunal had, in
fact, reduced the original SFA sentence when they put the ban into
effect immediately, as two of Everton's games will be played while he is
still serving his spell in jail.
Farry concluded: ''The major lesson for everybody concerned is that
there is real need to heed the clear, unambiguous signals coming from
society. The onus is on professionals in the game to meet the exacting
standards of behaviour demanded on and off the field.
''They are ambassadors for our sport and they should know now that if
they transgress, there is no hiding place.''
Despite that viewpoint, the protests about the decision to turn down
his appeal have incensed Ferguson's club representatives, one of whom,
secretary Michael Dunford, said that Everton would probably now consider
going to the European Court of Human Rights. This may seem a laudable
course, but it is not the most practical suggestion as Duncan might well
be past his sell-by date as a player by the time a verdict was reached.
The Everton manager and chairman insisted again that they felt the
player was being punished twice. ''Not even muggers suffer that,'' said
chairman Peter Johnston who felt the decision was ''unfair and unjust.''
However, the truth is that the club and others who feel the same way
have ignored, or have chosen to ignore, the background to Ferguson's
jail sentence.
The former Rangers man was already on probation after previous
offences against the law, and the head-butt of John McStay in April,
1994, was seen by the court as a breach of that probation order. Whether
the procurator fiscal should be getting involved in these on-field
activities is part of a different debate but, once he did, the
likelihood was that the accumulation of misdemeanours would result in a
jail sentence.
The protest by Everton recalls similar rumblings from supporters of
Manchester United's Eric Cantona when they claimed that the Frenchman
had been punished four times, after having been fined by his club,
suspended by the FA, sentenced to community service, and stripped of his
international captaincy by the French.
In both cases, however, the football authorities have deemed it
sensible to act independently of any outside happenings and that would
seem the only proper course if they are to convince an increasingly
sceptical society that football can look after its own problems.
Meanwhile, Everton manager Joe Royle, whose club paid #4.3m for
Ferguson last December before he became the man in charge, continued to
voice his anger at the loss of his popular striker for another two
months. Royle refused to disclose what action, if any, Everton would be
taking as he flew out to Dublin with his side for tonight's friendly
against Irish League side Home Park.
''I'm bitterly disappointed by the decision, but I can't say that I'm
surprised,'' he said, ''Effectively, for an incident where nobody was
hurt and Duncan certainly was not booked or sent off, we're now going to
miss him for the best part of a quarter of a season.
''Both Duncan and Everton have now been punished twice -- and punished
over the top. It's very sad but I'm not surprised and Duncan has just
got to get on with it now.''
Everton are likely to try to buy a new striker during Ferguson's
continued absence. They recently called off a deal with Sheffield
Wednesday for David Hirst and have been linked this week with
Blackburn's Chris Sutton and Wimbledon's Dean Holdsworth.

THE Scottish Rugby Union has presented the case for the defence
following the criticisms made by its most recently retired captain,
Gavin Hastings, in The Herald this week. Hastings, who became the most
capped Scot in the history of the game before retiring after the World
Cup, declared that the Union was ''talking down'' its players in order
to get them on the cheap.
He fears that Scottish stars, who are on the brink of signing a
five-month, five-match contract worth #22,500, will be placed at a
severe disadvantage when confronted by Kiwi full-timers on about
#100,000-a-year when Scotland tour New Zealand next summer.
Hastings also maintains that the game has been thrown to the wolves by
the International Board which ushered in professionalism without setting
in place a Northern Hemisphere structure in which the professional game
could operate. He said, too, that the Murrayfield committee structure
should be streamlined to put it in better shape to run a professional
game.
Yesterday, in a statement, the SRU declared that Hastings' critical
analysis misses the bigger picture.
The Union, which says it has to balance its guardianship of the
national game and preparation of international sides with its commitment
to the clubs, stated: ''There is no doubt that the IRFB announcements on
professionalism in August have thrown up immense challenges within the
game.
''Let's not be under any illusions that there are quick or easy
answers, or forget that the SRU is only the tip of an iceberg that
encompasses thousands of players, officials, referees, and
administrators.''
The Union said that everyone involved in rugby should have a shared
vision for its successful development.
''At the highest level of achievement, the SRU recognises its
responsibilities to those players, as we also recognise the commitments
and hardships that have brought them to international recognition in the
first place.
''The SRU will provide for the country's top players in a way that is
prudent, recognising that the Union's resources are finite. That fact is
both self-evident and accepted by the players themselves, and forms the
basis of the negotiation of a contract.
''The contract will cover the period to the end of the Five Nations
championship, with a separate contract for the tour to New Zealand in
late spring 1996.''
''The SRU can only re-affirm its ultimate challenge -- to the
successful development of the game at all levels.''
Last night, Hastings said: ''My comments have only ever had one aim
and that is the continuing success of the Scottish national side. From
their statement, the SRU seem to be saying that this is their aim as
well, so we are in agreement on that and I am delighted.''
''The international side represents the shop window of the game. If
the shop window is attractive then the game prospers.''
And he added: ''My comments this week about the structure of the game
and player payments and the way in which the game is administered from
Murrayfield have all had one objective, and that is to ensure that
Scotland does not become a second-class rugby nation.''

FRANK Bruno's WBC heavyweight title defence against Mike Tyson was
given the go-ahead yesterday at the World Boxing Council's convention in
Chiang Mai, Thailand.
The official WBC sanctioning of Bruno-Tyson, following unsuccessful
legal moves by former champion Lennox Lewis to prevent the fight taking
place, sets up the rematch for Las Vegas. March 16 is the planned date.
Bruno's promoter Frank Warren said: ''This will be Frank's mandatory
defence. The winner will have to defend against the next mandatory
challenger by September next year.
''The date is still to be confirmed but March 16 is the one we are
looking at. I'm delighted, justice was seen to be done. The courts in
Britain had thrown out Lewis' action against Bruno and the WBC.
''They were told that any further legal action should be taken in
Dallas, Texas, but they completely disregarded that and have taken it to
New Jersey.
''Bruno will receive the biggest purse of any British fighter.''
Bruno could bank as much as #10m for tackling Tyson for a second time
with the roles reversed. Tyson was champion when Bruno was stopped in
five rounds at the Hilton Hotel, Las Vegas in February 1989.
That kind of mega-purse would substantially outstrip the previous
record of #6million-plus Lewis earned from his first defence of the WBC
crown against Tony Tucker, also in Las Vegas in May 1993.
Lewis's manager Frank Maloney and American fight agent Don Majeski
made representations on behalf of the former champion in Thailand. ''I'm
not very happy with the decision,'' retorted Maloney. ''It seems the WBC
make rules to suit the WBC -- they're making a person bigger than an
organisation, and that person is Mike Tyson.''
Bruno said in Chiang Mai: ''I'm entitled to fight whoever I want. I've
fulfilled all my obligations. I'm not worried about Tyson. He's no more
fearful than anyone else out there.''

NOT many sportsmen can get the jump on Walker Cup golfing giant Gordon
Sherry, but Britain's World Championship gymnast Steven Frew (above)
managed it yesterday at Gleneagles.
The pair were among a group of leading Scottish sportsmen and women
launching the Scottish Sport World-class Group, a new initiative
designed to improve Scotland's standing in the international arena.
The idea, in fact, is to prevent as many people as possible from
getting the jump on Scots.
International football team manager Craig Brown, Sherry, and
Commonwealth 10,000 metres champion Yvonne Murray are part of the team,
and were among the speakers at the Bell's Open Forum to launch the
project, which is run by the Scottish Sports Council.
The distillers are backing the scheme for three years by sponsoring
team meetings.
In the next six months, the team, which includes consultants from the
world of business, education, and local government, will help the SSC
establish performance and development centres and athlete support
programmes to give leading competitors the assistance they need.

SUCCESSFUL football managers are frequently described as ''great
motivators.'' This conjures up an image of the awe-struck players
listening to the great man utter, at 2.50pm on a Saturday, those special
words which turn lambs into lions ready to pulverise the opposition.
Well, I've spent 21 years looking for these magical phrases but,
sadly, have to confess that I have yet to find them. Experience has
taught me, however, about what does not work when it comes to motivating
players, and top of that list is punishment.
After a defeat it is now common for a manager to harangue his team for
up to an hour in the dressing room and then announce to the press that
the church choirs of Scotland are to be left short-handed because the
lot of them are to report for extra training on Sunday morning.
Running a team is a co-operative venture in which the 'us' concept is
all important. Once you start punishing people 'us' becomes replaced by
'us and them.' Managers should realise that punishing players for poor
performances might please bitterly disappointed fans and directors, but
it does nothing for team spirit.
The other great de-motivator for players is any lack of organisation
about the club, particularly with regard to training and tactics.
Training has to be varied and interesting, and players show no mercy to
a manager who is tactically not with it.
After defeats they have lengthy post-mortems and the target for blame
is always the poor manager. He picked the wrong players in the wrong
formation and he failed to change things at half-time. That is why the
successful managers pay great attention to detail when defining the
team's tactics.
It is important that the players do not blame a poor performance on
the deficiencies of the manager. If this happens, unity suffers and the
manager can quickly become one of 'them.'
What then can be done about motivation in a positive sense? Without
doubt money is a powerful tool. A healthy wage packet makes all of us
feel cared for and ready to do that little bit extra for our employer.
But, strangely enough, I have found that increasing the win bonus for a
particular game has little effect.
In the excitement before last Sunday's Challenge Cup final I forgot to
tell the Stenhousemuir players how much the bonus would be for winning.
None of them asked -- just being in a final was everything!
A trick Alex Ferguson has used successfully over the years is to find
for the team a common foe. Whilst at Aberdeen he worked hard at
convincing his players that there was a West of Scotland plot to prevent
them gaining success and at Manchester United he seems to have used the
Eric Cantona affair to paint the world outside Old Trafford as being
inhabited by people who want to see the club fall flat on its face.
With Stenhousemuir it is difficult to find a common enemy (what is
there to hate about Brechin City?), but I do, however, find myself
scouring the back pages hoping to discover that our next opponents have
said something less than complimentary about the Warriors. Up it goes on
the notice board and out runs the team, indignant to a man, and
determined to put to the sword those who have so greviously insulted us.
How about healthy competition for places as a means of getting the
best out of players? There is definitely something in this. Being an
automatic selection can breed complacency and yet most players give of
their best when they are secure in the knowledge that they will still be
in the team after a bad game. All great teams have had a consistency of
selection and personally, when I was a player, knowing that I was
playing for my place never failed to draw the strength from my legs.
How do you motivate? It's easy: don't punish; be organised; pay well;
find a common foe; look for insults; get a settled team; and lastly, but
most importantly, realise that motivation takes place not only on match
days but during every minute of every day that the club is open for
business.

Christian von Arnim argues that as Nigeria's military regime confirms
the death sentence for nine of its opponents the Commonwealth must stop
dithering.
NO MILITARY regimes are pleasant, but the Nigerian version is a
particularly unpleasant one. With impeccable timing, the military
leaders in Lagos have thrown down the gauntlet to the Commonwealth
leaders -- whose summit begins in New Zealand today -- with the
confirmation of the death sentences on the writer, environmentalist and
Ogoni activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of his fellow members of the
Movement for the Survival of Ogoni Peoples (MOSOP). Two of the men,
MOSOP president Saro-Wiwa himself and Dr Barinem Kiobel, are Amnesty
International prisoners of conscience.
Convicted of murder at the end of October in what Amnesty described as
''grossly unfair and politically motivated trials'' Nigeria's military
leader, General Abacha, has clearly used the cases as a way to try to
get rid of the thorn in his side which MOSOP and its president
represent.
Particularly galling for the government has been the organisation's
non-violent campaign against environmental damage caused by oil
exploitation in southern Nigeria and for more autonomy for the Ogoni
people in Rivers State in the south-eastern part of the country.
That in itself was dangerous enough for the regime. But the much
greater risk was that if MOSOP were to be successful in its campaign, it
would set a precedent for other minorities who are as much concerned as
the Ogoni about protecting the environment and traditional industries
such as fishing from the pollution brought by the oil companies, but who
have been more cautious in pursuing that cause.
The Ogoni have also been in the forefront of a campaign to force the
government to share out oil revenues more equitably.
As a result, the military has cracked down hard on the Ogoni. Amnesty
cites allegations of torture or ill-treatment not only against those on
trial, but extrajudicial executions and the destruction of villages and
homes in Ogoniland. Another human rights organisation Human Rights
Watch/Africa has presented evidence of soldiers shooting unarmed
villagers, raping women and burning homes.
The environmental organisation Greenpeace had sight of a Nigerian
government memo which summed the policy up in the clearest terms:
''Shell operations still impossible unless ruthless military operations
are undertaken for smooth economic activity to commence.''
Oil is one of the key elements in the equation. Nigeria has about one
per cent of the world's proven petroleum reserves and they are similar
in quality to North Sea oil. It is Nigeria's key export, accounting for
more than 80% of its foreign income.
The oil giant Shell, which produces half of the country's daily
output, has been a particular target of the campaign against the
environmental depredation caused by the exploitation of this valuable
resource. The oil companies stand accused of failing to clean up after
themselves.
Shell ceased operations in Ogoniland in 1993 after civil disturbances
there. Yet if the intention of the government crackdown was to pacify
the region and persuade Shell to return there, it has failed so far.
The oil company, which has added its voice to those who have spoken
out against the death sentence, has no plans to resume operations in
Ogoniland, according to the managing director of its Nigerian
subsidiary.
In a realistic assessment of the difficulties the company would
continue to face if it decided to go back without local consent, he said
yesterday: ''We can only go back there if all the communities want us
back and the area is still economically attractive.''
Shell International was quick to align itself with the ''quiet
diplomacy'' course being advocated by the South African President Nelson
Mandela rather than the calls for more drastic action such as expulsion
from the Commonwealth.
The Nigerian regime has shown itself immune to any pressure except
where it hurts: economic sanctions and international isolation. Last
month General Abacha commuted the death sentence on alleged coup
plotters after the threat of international sanctions and exclusion from
the Commonwealth summit. That, coupled with intercession by leading
international statesmen such as Nelson Mandela, brought results.
General Abacha also presented a timetable for the restoration of
democracy last month, which anyone who is aware of the abysmal record of
successive military governments in this respect will have regarded with
a great deal of scepticism.
Certainly, the internationally respected Nigerian writer and exile
Wole Soyinka has no doubts about what course to take: ''It is important
to take decisive action of a nature which will terminate this toying,
this sadistic cat-and-mouse game which Abacha is playing with the
Nigerian people, with the international community as audiences -- and
sometimes, I regret to say, as complacent collaborative audiences.''
Soyinka has precedent on his side in arguing for strong action to stop
what Ken Saro-Wiwa's son has described as the ''horrific inevitability''
of the events likely to end with the death of his father and the eight
other activists unless the international community intervenes.
An oil embargo would be a first step. The Commonwealth is divided over
what course to pursue, but if the international community dithers much
longer, it will be too late.
In Soyinka's words: ''Believe me, in another few weeks there will be
yet another atrocity committed by Abacha's regime, deliberately
manufactured, structured to obliterate the memory of Ken Saro-Wiwa, if
we do not wake up to his pattern of inhuman outrages.'' The Ogoni would
agreed.

NEWCASTLE winger David Ginola and Manchester United's Eric Cantona
have both been left out of the French squad for next week's vital
European Championship qualifier against Israel in Caen. Trainer Aime
Jacquet intends standing by the players who beat Romania 3-1 in
Bucharest last month.
But he did recall Paris St Germain striker Patrice Loko, two-goal
destroyer of Celtic in the Cup-winners' Cup last week, in place of the
injured Christophe Dugarry, a choice which may have the look of a snub,
especially to Ginola, who has been in excellent form with Newcastle.
''We built up something in our last match in Bucharest,'' said
Jacquet. ''I want all those who took part in it to stay together.''
Ginola was accused of undermining the French team's World Cup hopes
before the crucial qualifier with Bulgaria two years ago by making loud
demands through the media for a place in the team. In the match, he gave
away the ball in the last minute and Bulgaria cashed in to win 2-1, a
result which cost France a place in the World Cup finals.
Jacquet did wave an olive branch towards the wayward Cantona. ''He is
a special case,'' he said. ''But the team must be spared from surprises
just now. This is a match we have to win.''
* CHELSEA defender Dan Petrescu was yesterday named in Romania's squad
for their final qualifier against Slovakia in Kosice next Wednesday,
despite his recent lack of competitive football. Petrescu has not played
a match for a month, as his #2.3m move from Sheffield Wednesday was held
up by a medical hitch. He is now waiting for his work permit to be
renewed.
Group 1 leaders Romania, one point ahead of France, need to beat
Slovakia to be sure of qualifying for the finals.
* ARSENAL striker Dennis Bergkamp will spearhead the Holland attack in
their decisive Group 5 match against Norway next Wednesday.
Bergkamp replaces young Ajax striker Patrick Kluivert, who is banned
for one match. Lazio midfielder Aron Winter also returns after
suspension.
The Dutch must beat Norway in Rotterdam to qualify for the finals,
while Norway need at least a draw.
* VETERAN Wolves defender Eric Young has been called up into the Wales
squad for next week's championship match in Albania.

CALEDONIAN Thistle's prospects of staying in the Scottish League are
under threat after a new setback in their bid to build a #5.2m stadium
complex.
Thistle claim they require a #900,000 grant from Inverness District
Council towards the cost of their new home. If not, they will be unable
to meet the SFA's deadline of August, 1996, for the work to be
completed.
Club chairman Doug McGilvray believes the club would be forced to quit
the league if the council fail to come up with the funds. But a meeting
of councillors on Wednesday night deferred a decision until a full
council meeting next Tuesday amid claims that the club's business plan
was flawed.
The policy and resources committee cast doubts on claims that the
development could unlock a massive investment boom in the East Longman
industrial area of Inverness.
One councillor branded the business plan ''Alice in Wonderland
stuff,'' and suggested there was nothing to justify supplying public
money to a private club.
The business plan is believed to include a multi-million pound marina,
a ski slope, facilities for rugby, squash, archery, indoor and outdoor
tennis, and motor sport, conference facilities, offices, and an outdoor
music venue, plus picnic and dolphin watching facilities beside the
Moray Firth.
The business plan is also understood to claim that the new stadium and
the release of two football grounds formerly belonging to merger
partners Caledonian and Inverness Thistle would generate 200
construction jobs and 130 other full-time jobs.
But council chief executive Alan Imlah told members there were
''important omissions'' and said he would need to seek clarification
from the club.
Councillor Ron Lyon dismissed the club's proposals as a ''wish list,''
adding: ''There is not a single matter of substance or a single sentence
of substance in it all. It is Alice in Wonderland stuff.''
No-one at the club was available for comment yesterday.
The SFA's stadium deadline has already been extended by one year after
an appeal by the club. Ominously, a recent letter to the club from SFA
secretary Jim Farry warned: ''As you know, failure to ensure full
account is taken of the requirements of the body of which your club is
currently in associate membership, could lead to the association
refusing to make Caledonian Thistle a full member.''
Ironically, Caledonian Thistle are riding high in the third division
and have recorded the highest attendances in the division this season.
Tuesday's meeting should, one way or the other, clarify Thistle's
future.

KILMARNOCK venture into Europe for the first time tomorrow, when they
make their debut in the Confederation Cup against Luxembourg's Petange.
Bidding to become the first Scottish team ever to win a tie in Europe,
Kilmarnock player-coach Jim McKenna admitted: ''All we know about
Petange is that they finished fourth in their league last season and
that they have a Yugoslav and a Romanian in their squad.
''But I have played against the Luxembourg national side in the past
and I don't think they will be out of our reach. A lot depends on how
strong their foreign players are.''
Kilmarnock welcome back GB cap Paul Carruthers, who missed last
weekend's league defeat by Rucanor Jets. McKenna has yet to make a
decision on whether he plays himself or not. ''If the team is playing
well then there will not be any need for me to go on court,'' he said.

AT The Herald's Challenge of Change Conference in Edinburgh on
November 2, George Kynoch, Minister for Industry and Local Government,
stated that since 1987 employment in local government in Scotland has
increased by 7% while in England the statistics show a 7% decrease.
Mr Kynoch inferred from this statement that local government in
Scotland was inefficient because the number of jobs had increased.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Scottish local authorities have kept in-house over 97% of the value of
contracts tendered under CCT whereas in England and Wales this figure is
only 76%. Indeed, it is because Scottish local authorities have been so
successful in competing for contracts against the private sector that
our employment levels have not decreased, as has been the case in
England.
There are another two reasons why local government employment has not
fallen in Scotland.
Only one school in Scotland has opted out of local government control.
Scottish local authorities have been much more successful in
protecting pupil/teacher ratios. In England there are over one million
pupils in class sizes of over 30.
Michael Forsyth and his Ministers have made a number of
unsubstantiated allegations to attack local government which are devoid
of research and analysis. If we are going to have a debate on local
government surely the onus is on the Scottish Office to ensure it is an
informed debate.

<ARTICLETYPE>CORRESPONDENCE</ARTICLETYPE>
<RECORDNO>975454367</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MINOR row has emerged about the wisdom, or the folly, of the
Government's recent pronouncement regarding rail privatisation -- that
operators who run their trains late will be penalised.
The argument has focused on the effect this will have on connections.
There is nothing new here, as many rail travellers will have learned
from experience. On a journey from Edinburgh to Manchester recently,
with an advertised connection at Preston, the latter was not held even
for two minutes because of the late-running Edinburgh train.
The explanation given to me by the official on Preston station was,
''If InterCity cannot run their trains on time that is their problem''.
The effect on passengers never entered into their consideration.
The Government's pronouncement caused me to reflect on incidents which
have happened over the last few months. Travelling south a passenger was
taken ill on the train near Lockerbie with a suspected heart attack. The
paramedics at Carlisle station were waiting for the train to arrive but
they would not take him off the train until they had checked and
stabilised the passenger's condition.
The result was we ran 20 minutes late over the remainder of the
journey. Who would be responsible for the penalty? Could it be the
passenger who falls ill, thereby causing the train to run late?
On another occasion the train was delayed at Carlisle for almost an
hour because, so we were told by the senior conductor, a passenger in
the preceding train, finding that a travelling companion had been left
on the platform at Carlisle, had pulled the emergency handle.
The train had come to a halt about a quarter of a mile outside the
station. The train crew were unable to release the brakes. Several
Preston-bound trains behind us were delayed, as were several northbound
trains south of the incident as negotiations took place between the
various operators and Railtrack about how to get the trains past the
incident.
The affected train was still stuck there as we eventually passed it on
the down line. In such circumstances would the penalty for the late
runing of up to six trains, and the knock-on effect of the delays, be
passed on to the passenger who had pulled the emergency handle?
Buying a rail ticket may be equivalent to taking out a mortgage.
To be 15 minutes late at Preston with connections to catch can be
inconvenient even if the train arrives on time at Euston, thereby
avoiding a penalty at its destination. If, as a Government spokesman
maintained, the penalty rule is being brought into effect ''to improve
the quality of service for passengers, particularly by discouraging
late-running trains'', will the penalty be applied at every point where
a late-running train stops en-route?
Like most of the approach these questions will be shunted into the
siding along with all the other ''somebody else's problem -- nothing to
do with us'' policies of the present Government.
Where does the money for the penalties come from? Passengers' fares,
of course. The worse the level of punctuality the higher the fares to
pay for the penalties. But where does the money go, who benefits from
the money collected through the penalty system? I would like to know.

THE Skye Bridge has attracted much comment in your pages and those of
other journals. The charges have been controversial, but the press has
focused on the controversy rather than theachievement.
The new bridge is a magnificent engineering feat by world standards of
which Scotland should be proud. It is a reflection of the way things are
today that this has not been better recognised. In addition the builders
have broken new ground in environmental protection in their efforts to
protect otters in the area.
The bridge is cheaper and quicker than the ferry (this winter for a
car #4.30 compared with #5.40 last winter and #2.44 for those who are
regular users).
It should be remembered that this project simply would not have
happened within Government budgets, probably for a long time to come.
The private finance method has enabled the bridge to be built much
earlier.
We would encourage people to use the bridge as much as possible, so
that the loans can be paid off quickly. As soon as that is done the
bridge will be handed back to the Scottish Office so that it can become
free, which could be in 15-18 years according to current predictions.
We fully recognise the point of view of the protesters and their right
to express their views through peaceful protest. However, anyone who
does not pay should appreciate that others have to meet the shortfall
caused by non-payers in the long run, so that the bridge loans can be
paid off.
While we can sympathise with an island community which has little
other option but to use the bridge for access to the mainland, this was
ever the case with the ferry and the ferry was often subject to delay.
It was encouraging to notice that during the storms the other day when
the ferry would not, we belive, have been able to run, the bridge
remained open.
Two points to remember. While monopolies are a bad thing, if people
were to use an alternative ferry in competition with the bridge, the
tolls would last longer. Secondly if the Scottish Office were to find a
grant to pay off the loans, other urgent projects elsewhere in Scotland
or in Skye would presumably have to be delayed.

I REALLY must protest at the loaded way Murray Ritchie has reported on
the European Parliament's Register of Members' Interests (November 8).
I personally have not ''failed to disclose'' anything. Instead, I have
meticulously declared all the interests I have; academic, industrial,
and commercial, in all the detail that is required by the Parliament.
It is true that the amounts are not listed. It is also true that they
are not required at the present moment; therefore, I cannot possibly
have failed with all the innuendo of international deceit that the
report appears to suggest.
Murray Ritchie does not tell us that another Scottish MEP declares a
professional consultancy without listing the amount but of course, since
that MEP is not Labour, Mr Ritchie applies different standards.
So far as I am concerned, the European Parliament should require clear
statements of professional, commercial, academic, and political
interests of its members and these statements should be as freely
available as possible.
As one who has argued for maximum transparency in the Parliament for
many years, I might add that only when we get that will we be free of
the careless and sometimes mischievous reporting of our work.
Ken Collins, MEP,

<HEADLINE>Explore Libya's offer on trial</HEADLINE>

<ARTICLETYPE>CORRESPONDENCE</ARTICLETYPE>
<RECORDNO>975454370</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ON November 8 the Washington Post carried an advertisement apparently
placed by the Libyan regime, appealing to Lockerbie relatives to put
pressure on their governments to support the setting up of a trial in a
neutral country.
For several years the British group, UK Families-Flight 103, have been
doing that and also pressing the Lord Advocate to consider such a move.
It seems to us that the Libyan offer to allow the accused to attend for
trial at The Hague (or certain alternative venues), under a Scottish
judge offers the chance of a fair trial and should be explored.
It is patently obvious that they are not going to be released for
trial in the US, or, unfortunately, Scotland. Hitherto the Foreign
Office and Scottish Office have cited the difficulties of setting up
such a trial, and their belief that the Libyans would not honour their
promise, as reasons for not trying.
Perhaps now that there is a Scottish Foreign Secretary and a brand new
Lord Advocate there will be a change of direction.
If so it will be essential to address the exact nature of what is on
offer: the Libyans previously specified ''a panel of international
judges led by a Scottish judge''; now their advertisement talks of a
trial ''by Scottish judges under Scottish law''.
Neither phrase specifies a jury trial, and the exposure of the public
in the US/UK to media coverage of ''the evidence'' against the accused
is said to be one of the objections they have to trial here or in the US
under the jury system.
It would be tragic if an honest attempt to compromise were to be
ruined by any misunderstanding of what is actually on offer. A fair
''neutral country'' trial cannot be an impossible goal, remembering that
the UN currently supports a trial facility for alleged Bosnian war
criminals at The Hague, which it must believe would be fair.
It is to be expected and hoped that Scotland's new senior law officer
will look at the whole picture as a matter of the utmost urgency, and
make his decisions solely in the interests of truth and justice, and
that having done so he will receive what help he needs from the
Government.
After four years of waiting for a fair trial, we must give him time to
review the position urgently but thoroughly.

ON Wednesday the Nigerian military government confirmed the court
sentences of death by hanging on the accused members of the Movement for
the Survival of the Ongoni Peoples who were charged with the murder of
four pro-government chiefs. The accused men, who include Ken Saro-Wiwa,
the distinguished literary figure, were sentenced after a trial which
satisfied no outside observer as to its fairness. The government seems
firm because, as its spokesmen pointed out, it is a case of murder. All
the more reason for the trial to have been fair. Commonwealth countries,
meeting for their Heads of State conference in Auckland today, are
unconvinced of the fairness of the trial and would like clemency to
prevail. Their leaders were reassured by the Nigerian military's
willingness earlier this month to invoke clemency in another set of
political trials, but things could be different this time, partly
because the Commonwealth is divided on how best to respond to the
situation. Some countries are for sanctions against Nigeria, and can
even contemplate the threat of expulsion from the Commonwealth. Such an
extreme move would have the drawback of ending all ability to persuade
the Nigerians to other courses. It is, for example, opposed on that
ground by the President of South Africa, Mr Nelson Mandela, who is
instead all in favour of direct and personal negotiation.
If President Mandela could be charged with the responsibility for
direct negotiations there might be reason to hope for success. His is a
unique authority in Black Africa and indeed his reputation is worldwide
and transcends race and national identity in a way which is exceptional.
It still might not be enough to change the minds of military men, but it
would be reinforced by the mounting pressure of international diplomacy
which is now evident and still growing. Even that may not change
military minds: it would be better to threaten sanctions -- refusal to
buy Nigeria's oil, for example -- from the start. The military regime
has shown little sensitivity to mere diplomatic pressure before, and the
rumours which yesterday swept Lagos, the country's capital, to the
effect that the prisoners had been hanged, may suggest that proponents
of clemency should act urgently. The rumours were officially denied but
they could signal the Military Council's intention to act decisively and
speedily to dispel any suggestion of weakness following the earlier act
of clemency. The generals may conclude that if they give in to foreign
pressure twice in a single month their authority will evaporate.
It would be better if the Commnwealth heads could speak with one voice
to a Nigeria which remained within their ranks. They may, however, be
distracted by the other issue of their conference -- the French nuclear
tests and the willingness of Mr Major to support them, a stance which
again makes Britain unusual within the European Union. The French tests
are certainly a serious issue but it must seem as if there is nothing
the Commonwealth will be able to do collectively which would add to what
has been achieved by antipodean members, and other Pacific Rim
countries, individually -- sadly, nothing. In Nigeria, by contrast, a
united Commonwealth front might just affect the imaginations of military
men and substitute prison for execution. A refusal to buy Nigerian oil
might seem too blunt to affect any imaginations but it represents the
kind of language army officers should be able to appreciate. Oil is
Nigeria's one big foreign earner and it is vital to the economy.
Threatening to end its sales is, of course, crude blackmail, but more
considered and delicate strategies may get nowhere.

THE current land reform debate in The Herald seems to have forgotten
the crucial issue: the power of money to buy land. Land as a commodity
and the ability to own land as a function of the size of a person's bank
balance. Questions of landlord nationality and residence are of
secondary importance.
Bodies such as the John Muir Trust want us to move from absentee
landlords to absentee trustees while continuing the ''land as
commodity'' ethos which has produced severe social and environmental
disruption.

THE two-minute silence at 11am on November 11, this Saturday, has
already gained tremendous support.
The Royal British Legion has given our nation the first opportunity
for 50 years to show our gratitude on Armistice Day itself for the
sacrifice of those who gave their lives in two world wars and the 70
conflicts and actions since 1945, including the current peacekeeping
operations in former Yugoslavia.
Sixteen million men and women who served in the forces have a right to
call upon the legion for help if they, or their families, need it.
If the legion is to continue to help them from now well into the 21st
century, it is essential that everyone, and especially young people who
have been spared the need for military service, understand our work.
The two-minute silence will also do much to achieve that aim.
The Prime Minister, John Major, former Prime Minister Lord Callaghan,
House of Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd, and leading national figures
will observe the silence.
Tills in National Lottery outlets and many supermarkets and small
shops will close from 11 to 11.02am.
Many buses, taxis, lorries and cars will stop where it is safe to do
so.
The Royal British Legion hopes that everywhere in the country as many
people who can will observe the silence in order to reflect and remember
what we all owe to those men and women who served in our forces.
Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey Dalton,
National President,
The Royal British Legion.

<TEXT>
DISGRACED George Graham was effectively alleged to be a liar last
night when the Football Association lifted the lid on the inquiry which
led to the former Arsenal manager being banned from football for a year.
The FA released a ''Statement of Reasons'' produced by the three-man
disciplinary commission which considered allegations against Graham last
July.
It follows the release of Graham's book, The Glory and the Grief, and
a series of high-profile media opportunities by the man who took Arsenal
to two league titles and cup success at home and abroad.
''The Football Association has acted as a direct result of the
serialisation of a book by Mr Graham in a national newspaper last
week,'' said a statement. ''It was his choice to re-open public debate
on his case. As a private citizen outside football, he had a right to do
so.
''Equally, The Football Association has a right, and now a
responsibility, to set the record straight.''
The bulk of the case is well documented, although there remains a
difference of opinion over the nature of the payments totalling #425,500
made to Graham by now discredited agent Rune Hauge -- cash which was
later returned to Highbury -- involving transfers of Pal Lydersen from
IK Start and John Jensen from Brondby.
Graham maintains these were unsolicited gifts, but the FA's inquiry
team, headed by disciplinary chief Geoff Thompson, reasoned: ''As a
respected manager of a Premier League team and a senior figure in the
League Managers' Association, we find that he (Graham) must have known
just how serious a matter it was for him to be receiving this amount of
money from an agent.
''When it happened for a second time after the Jensen deal, this must
have struck him even more forcefully.''
It was after digesting the Statement of Reasons -- legal costs alone
amounted to more than #130,000 -- that Graham decided not to appeal
against his ban which expires on June 30 next year.
The statement continued: ''Mr Graham agreed in his evidence that it
would be wrong to accept money from an agent directly connected with any
Arsenal transfer.
''Mr Graham told us that he did not declare the payments to Arsenal
because he did not consider them to be connected to transfers. We do not
accept this.
''We should state that this judgment is based on the evidence which we
heard. We have placed no reliance on Mr Graham's allegedly inconsistent
answers to the FA-Premier League enquiry.
''Mr Graham's evidence that he made only brief enquiries as to the
reason for the payment and as to his satisfaction with the explanations
given to him by Mr Hauge is, we find, wholly unconvincing.
''When he received the bundles of cash in the Park Lane Hotel, he must
have reflected on the fact that he had only recently succeeded in
negotiating a cut for Mr Hauge in relation to the Lydersen deal.
''Similar thoughts must have occurred to him when he received another
payment so soon after the Jensen deal.
''Mr Hauge's explanation for the payments is impossible to accept. We
have no doubt, therefore, that when Mr Graham received each of the two
payments he knew the reason for the receipt, namely that they arose
directly out of or in connection with the two transfers.
''We are sure of this in relation to the Lydersen deal. It is equally
compelling in relation to the second payment.''
According to the FA's records, Graham did not tell anyone at Arsenal
about the payments until September 19, 1994, and less than three months
later the sum of #465,500 -- the money received from Hauge plus interest
-- was transferred to the club by him.
Meanwhile, on a happier note, former Arsenal and England striker Alan
Smith was rewarded with a near-#250,000 gate for his Highbury benefit
match last night against Italian side Sampdoria, which The Gunners won
2-0.
Smith, who won two League championship medals and scored 117 goals in
his eight-year Arsenal career including the European Cup Winners' Cup
decider against Parma 18 months ago, was paid an appropriate tribute by
17,145 fans.
Despite the knee injury which forced his retirement at the age of 32
in the summer, he played the first 14 minutes against Sampdoria. Ian
Wright and John Hartson got the goals. * KILMARNOCK'S Tom Brown, who
limped off after just 26 minutes in the 2-0 midweek defeat by Rangers,
will be sidelined for two weeks with a calf injury.
* JOHN Colquhoun's move to Airdire has been put on hold. Hearts
manager Jim Jefferies accepted a bid by the first division side earlier
this week, but Airdrie's Alex McDonald said: ''There are a couple of
problems which we can't do much about.''

DESPITE Drew McMaster's recent public admission that he used banned
anabolic steroids to fuel a sprint career which brought him several
Scottish titles and Commonwealth relay gold, the Scottish Athletic
Federation have decided to take no action.
The decision will cause despair among competitors and parents. Rightly
or wrongly, it will be interpreted as athletics turning a blind eye to
drug-taking -- precisely the charge laid at the door of senior officials
by McMaster in a Sunday newspaper article, allegations which are now the
subject of legal action.
In a statement issued yesterday, it emerged that all seven of the 10
eligible SAF council members present voted to back the following
statement:
''After discussion of all the evidence available, and subject to the
impending legal actions being brought about by Mr Frank Dick and Dr Jim
Ledingham, following accusations made against them by the former
athlete, Mr Drew McMaster, the SAF Council unanimously agreed that no
further action would be taken regarding the matter.
SAF secretary Bob Greenoak confirmed that this means no action
''irrespective of the outcome'' of any litigation.
''He has admitted using drugs, but we cannot prove it,'' said
Greenoak. ''Under Scots law, that does not mean anything.''
Wrong -- a confession is the most conclusive evidence of guilt.
This is the second piece of legal mumbo-jumbo which has been allowed
to divert Scottish athletics from the moral high ground. David Jenkins,
another member of the squad, admitted some years ago that he had used
drugs. The Scottish Amateur Athletic Association considered relieving
Jenkins of his individual national 400 metre record, but were advised
not to for fear of possible legal reprisals.
Legal advice available to The Herald suggests that Jenkins would have
found it almost impossible to pursue any claim.
Greenoak stated earlier that the relay team was tested at the time,
and therefore was clear of drugs when the record was set. One of the
quartet, Cameron Sharp, has since confirmed in The Herald that no tests
were done.
This latest decision will embarrass not only the Scottish Sports
Council, who fund the SAF and who are violently opposed to drug-taking,
but also within their own sport. The athletics sub-committee which
recommends ratification of records wants to strike from their lists the
national 4 x 100m time which won gold in Edmonton, and they have
recommended to the track and field commission that this be done.
''The SAAA had already set a precedent by allowing Jenkins' individual
400m and the relay record to stand,'' said Greenoak. ''We feel
McMaster's is the same story.''
The relay performance in question was then also a UK record, and the
yardstick by which subsequent Commonwealth Games candidates have been
judged. Now, like Jenkins' 400m mark, it taunts and tempts succeeding
generations.
SAF president Peter Carton insists this should not be interpreted as a
license to use drugs. ''We do not in any way encourage the use of drugs
in any way whatsoever,'' he said.
Applications for the post of manager for the 1998 Commonwealth games
team manager shlould be submitted by December 15. We think
self-confessed drug cheats may be ineligible. But don't bet on it.

THE welfare state requires modernisation, but if Labour thoughts on
that issue are accurately reflected by Mr Gordon Brown's plans for
jobless youth we may be in for a bumpy time. His proposals are
uncharacteristic in that they appear to be the product of some rather
hurried thinking. The political intent is obvious, indeed pronounced
quite clearly by Mr Brown. His policy on unemployment is aimed
deliberately at the anxious middle classes of southern England who fear
the rise of a hopeless class of young unemployed who will thereby turn
to crime. The plight of the young unemployed is not in doubt, but to
present policies for alleviating unemployment with the comment that they
represent the best anti-crime policies which the Labour Party could
deliver seems rather to miss the mark. Yes, unemployment leads to
despair and despair can lead to criminal behaviour but there are many
reasons for relieving social suffering other than a desire to lower the
rate of burglaries in Kent. There is an election to be won, of course,
but if we object to the packaging of these proposals, what can be made
of the detail?
Not a great deal. The desire to deal with the problem of unemployment
among the young is genuine but the methods proposed are unimpressive. An
obligation to take part in one of a number of work schemes is a solution
similar to that of the present Government, but the threat of removing
40% of income support for non-compliance is no more likely to work for
Labour than it does for the Tories. It is dangerous, because it could
significantly increase the number of homeless youths which is already a
scandal of national proportions. It is incompetent because there is no
proof that it works and considerable suspicion that it does not. The
unemployed are generally keen to work if only a decent opportunity could
be provided. In that respect coercion is an insulting irrelevancy. The
small minority who do not want to work are likely to display deep-seated
problems which will be utterly impervious to coercion. It is, therefore,
a stick with crude electoral appeal but little else to recommend it. Mr
Brown claims that his ideas do not represent work-fare because the
recipients will be working for a wage rather than benefit. This is true
in comparison with the unhappy American model, but they have compulsion
in common. It would be better to put in place sensible and attractive
work schemes and to monitor their takeup before deciding that a stick
should be added to the carrot.
The Shadow Chancellor's proposals have merit in that they might lead
to an improvement in the woeful standard of training available to young
people, but while this in itself might have a minor effect on the level
of unemployment it can never be the whole answer. It seems clear that
the key to solving unemployment is not training, work schemes, job
subsidies, or a mixture of all three. That approach has been tried in a
number of countries without noticeable success. We must understand,
absorb, and act on the fact that, while proposals of the sort put
forward by the Shadow Chancellor have a part to play in motivating and
training a future workforce (although without coercion), the real
solution to unemployment is the creation of jobs through sustained and
intelligent investment in and by industry. In this respect Britain's
record is poor. Mr Brown has plans to encourage investment in British
industry and we look forward to some understanding of them at an early
date. Without investment yesterday's proposals are peripheral to the
real problems. With investment, and the improved economy it will create,
proper training and work schemes could blossom.

THERE is nothing so old as yesterday's headlines and it is now a week
since Stephen Hendry woke up to find himself, for the first time in his
eventful young life, at the centre of political controversy.
However, it would scarcely do justice to the curious circumstances in
which that story arose if it disappeared without a small post-mortem.
For it is an episode which, apart from its modest political
ramifications, surely calls into question the right of any individual to
speak for another, and to be taken at face value when doing so.
By last Friday morning Stephen Hendry had been catapulted on to the
tabloid front pages by the expression of views which were not expressed
by him and which, by various reliable accounts, he does not hold. Whose
idea, I wonder, was that? Was his manager, Mr Ian Doyle, acting entirely
alone?
Stephen was given a hard time by the Daily Record, which was aghast at
''his'' threat to leave Scotland if a devolved parliament created by a
Labour government were to impose an additional level of taxation. The
Record opened its phone lines for a poll on whether or not readers
agreed with Stephen; irrespective of the fact that the lad hadn't opened
his mouth.
Meanwhile, in the eyes of the Daily Express and Sir Michael Hirst,
Stephen was a new popular hero; a Braveheart of the status quo. Sir
Michael opined: ''He (sic) is right to denounce this anti-Scottish tax
and it is public spirited of him (sic) to voice concern, which is shared
by a great many Scots.''
It remains unclear what qualifies the man who managed to lose Bearsden
for the Tories to speak for ''a great many Scots'' any more than for ''a
great many Martians''. But it is entirely clear that Stephen Hendry had
done nothing to earn Sir Michael's admiration, for he had said nothing
at all. Not one solitary word.
The one who had spoken was Doyle, the man in the camel-hair coat who
has doubtless helped make lots of money for Stephen Hendry but who has,
of course, also received a few bob in return due to the snooker player's
prowess on the green baize, rather than as a man of opinions.
Like so much that is tacky in Scottish politics, the elevation of
Stephen Hendry to the status of icon among Scottish Tories has strong
Stirling overtones. That is where Doyle, a wealthy wholesale ironmonger
before he even discovered snooker, is well known for his political
opinions.
Just a few days before crediting such dramatic views on Scotland's
constitutional future to his most distinguished client, Doyle had been
inveighing against Labour-controlled Stirling District Council for
failing to keep the streets clean.
The force of this assault was somewhat undermined when it emerged that
the streets of Stirling were awash with leaflets advertising Doyle's
snooker club, which had been placed on every windscreen in the town by
his son. Stirling District Council generously agreed not to press
charges.
The words actually attributed to Doyle were both garbled and highly
qualified. A decision by his client to leave Scotland was ''a long way
off'' and it wasn't just the tartan tax of Mr Forsyth's invention which
allegedly worried him, but also the level of ''top-rate taxes''.
We were left, however, with the firm impression that it was the
possibility of a particularly Scottish dimension to income tax which
most worried Doyle and, by extension, Stephen Hendry. ''The fact is,''
he (Doyle) was directly quoted as saying, ''why should the Scots
possibly be subjected to an extra tax over and above the UK?''
As students of grammar will have noted, that is not actually a fact
but a question. And it is one which Ian Doyle, as a Stirling Tory, is
both entitled and expected to ask. It is hardly surprising that he has
already ruled out the possibility of a Scottish parliament containing a
majority of his own political disposition which would, of course, have
an equal power to cut income tax.
But if he had asked the same question in his own name, it is doubtful
if it would have merited a paragraph in the Stirling Observer -- a fact
which could scarcely have been lost on Doyle, far less Sir Michael Hirst
or indeed the Honourable Member for Stirling and propagandist-in-chief,
Michael Forsyth.
By Saturday, as it became clear from sources close to him that Stephen
Hendry wanted nothing to do with the views attributed to him,
journalists seeking clarification of Doyle's comments discovered that
the man in question had departed for that centre of fiscal flexibility,
Jersey -- a suitable vantage point from which to contemplate the evils
of fair taxation.
Then Stephen's dad weighed in, accusing Doyle in the Sun of ''playing
politics'' with his son's name. He reassured the nation that Stephen
''loves Scotland and can never wait to get home after tournaments''. On
this occasion, I understand that the Sun had got it absolutely right. He
also loves Hearts and there are not many tax havens from which that
enthusiasm can be pursued.
It is unrealistic to expect Stephen Hendry to clarify precisely how
much or how little he knew of Doyle's expressions of opinion in his
name. I'm sure that by the time he took up his cue on Saturday in the
Skoda Grand Prix he had put aside all thought of comparative tax
regimes.
Scotland will not hold any of this against Stephen Hendry, who seems
like a nice guy and who said nothing to offend anyone. But equally, we
are entitled to form -- or indeed reinforce -- our opinions of Messrs
Doyle, Forsyth, and Hirst, three blues you would never get tired of
potting.

Silviu Purcarete's robust version of The Tempest storms into the
Tramway next week. Sara Villiers considers the director's methods
WHEN the British producers of Silviu Purcarete's production of The
Tempest heard that the acclaimed Romanian director planned to stage it
without a set they fairly rubbed their hands together at the thought of
the potential expense spared. ''We thought 'no set, well, that'll be
cheap','' comments Stuart Rodgers, the general manager of the Nottingham
Playhouse who are co-producers of the play with Theatre Clwyd.
Little did they know of Purcarete's intentions. ''Then he said --
'all, I want is a philharmonic orchestra','' adds Rodgers.
Unsurprisingly, this has not come to pass, the combined purse-strings of
Nottingham Playhouse and Theatre Clwyd not quite stretching to employing
a full orchestra. Instead, Purcarete's desire to explore the quote from
the play ''the isle is full of noises'' has been realised through the
spirits of the island appearing as a string quintet.
The quintet, dressed in 18th-century courtiers' garb and powdered
wigs, play a specially commissioned score for strings by Vasile Sirli, a
fellow Romanian who is currently head of music at Disneyland. The music
is only one element of a bewitching soundscape which also entails
computer-generated noise and the eerie whispers of an ethereal Ariel who
is never given form.
Purcarete believes that The Tempest is a ''mysterious, dark labyrinth
to which there are many entrances''. In this production he enters the
text through music and its essence and origins. Striking images include
a confusion of music stands scattered across the stage and a Caliban
burdened under the weight of an oversized cello case. Here Prospero's
wand is a baton. He is a conductor conjuring up music which entrances.
In a previous production of the play by Purcarete, for the National
Theatre of Portugal in Porto last year, the actual theatre itself, an
antiquated dusty place on the verge of renovation, became the door into
the production. Prospero moved around the building like a ghost and
hardly ever appeared on the stage himself.
The Porto production caused some alarm for the British producers who
had previously commissioned The Tempest from Purcarete, the former
artistic director of the National Theatre of Cralova, after seeing his
stunning version of Phaedra at Glasgow's Tramway. Their fears were
allayed when he assured them that the British production would have a
distinct identity.
Speaking before the opening night at Nottingham, Purcarete, an
imposing figure of a man with a walrus moustache and mournful eyes,
spelt out that while there are similarities between the two productions,
for instance they share the designer Jose Manuel Melo, there are as many
differences. ''This is sadder, much more melancholic,'' he says.
He emphasises that The Tempest is open to endless interpretation, and
his attraction to the play is based on the fact that he believes it's
spirit is so robust that any version will be successful. ''You cannot
create a perfect Tempest, and it's not worth looking for that, but it
will never be a total failure. There is something so strong, so powerful
and so magic about it. Adults need magic and ecstasy and art is made for
that.''
He describes the company as a ''wonderful team'' but his
carefully-worded response to what he thought of the production, that ''I
always take my work as an experience and enjoy it even when it fails,''
hints at misgivings. These sentiments were expressed more explicitly in
a pre-show discussion, when he discussed overcoming the problems of the
language difficulties and the tight rehearsal period.
Used to the lengthier preparation time of Eastern Europe he found the
three weeks rehearsal schedule, the norm in Britain, oppressively short.
''I think that it's only from now on that we could really begin working,
we've only just found a cohesive language.'' He shrugs his shoulders
philosophically. ''But it's too late because it's the opening night.''
Despite his qualms the show has been well received. It's a powerful,
visually striking production, with light streaming through wires which
are strung across the stage like music bars.
''I always start with a visual idea, I read a text in images. My first
approach is to turn it into images,'' says Pucarete. ''I need a designer
generous enough to listen to my 'visions', my dreams and yet creative
enough to do his own job. When I have such a precise idea then it is
useless to torture the designer and I do it myself.''
He has a huge admiration for Shakespeare, who is the most performed
playwright in Romania, but he is bemused by the British reverence for
the text and had to fight his cast's resistance to any cuts. He admits
that he hates sitting in the theatre for more than two hours and was
determined to find ways of making the play shorter.
''I'm not into worshipping the word,'' he says. ''In Britain there is
a worshipping of the professor who taught you the text. It comes from a
huge love of the poetry of the text but sometimes this huge love can
suffocate the baby. I hate the idea of analysing the text for 12 hours
and spending 12 minutes rehearsing it. The text is better revealed
through constant working on it.
''British actors come from this system of work where there is always
this pressure of money. It makes them very quick and they try to do
things in the most obvious way. They don't have time to explore new ways
of seeing things, they don't have the time to make mistakes. The
pressure makes them try to understand everything but instead, because of
it, they often don't understand.''
While he insists that his experience on The Tempest was a very
pleasant one he has no immediate plans for any future British
collaboration, as he is about to take up the post as director of the
Centre National Dramatique in Limoges in at the beginning of next year.
The Tempest at the Tramway, which has previously hosted Purcarete's
remarkable Decameron 645 . . . 46 . . . 47 as well as Phaedra, could
well be the last chance for some years to come for Scottish audiences to
see the work of this inventive, internationally respected director.
* The Tempest, Tramway, Glasgow, Tuesday to Saturday next week.

WHEN the surviving members of Little Feat reconvened to play a
dedication party for a Los Angeles rehearsal complex in 1987 they
thought it would be a one-off. The band had split eight years earlier
after first the departure then sudden death of their founder, singer,
songwriter and slide guitarist sans pareil, Lowell George.
In between times, the others, none of them the sort of musicians you
would turn away, had found gainful employment. Keyboards player Bill
Payne, for example, worked with Bob Seger's Silver Bullet Band, and
Richie Hayward, drummer and creator of the inimitable Feat shuffle,
toured with Joan Armatrading and, later, Eric Clapton.
That day in 1987, however, they realised that working for others was
no substitute for working for themselves, and that despite their
misgivings following after George's demise, there was still a definite
Little Feat sound.
Fred Tackett, who contributed songs and occasional guitar to Feat
albums, was George's best friend and was touring with him when he died.
''No-one misses Lowell more than we do,'' he says. ''So when people say:
'You can't do this, or Lowell wouldn't have done that', we have to say:
'Get a life.' ''
For Tackett, the Feat sound, an amalgamation of blues, rock, country,
cajun music and jazz, has always stemmed from the origins of the
musicians involved. ''Bill Payne comes from Texas, bassist Kenny Gradney
and percussionist Sam Clayton come from Louisiana, and I come from
Arkansas homesteader stock; and when we were growing up, certainly, all
these places had different musical accents.''
The most significant change in the band's sound has been in the vocal
department. On their latest album, Ain't Had Enough Fun, backing
vocalist Shaun Murphy took over from former Pure Prairie League singer
Craig Fuller.
Tackett has no qualms about being in an old-fashioned band. ''The 'old
fogeys shouldn't be on the road' argument doesn't wash with us -- or our
children. My son is 27 -- he plays in a band, too, and any time I say to
him, 'Maybe I should quit this lark,' he says: 'You dare'.''

Christian von Arnim argues that as Nigeria's military regime confirms
the death sentence for nine of its opponents the Commonwealth must stop
dithering
NO MILITARY regime is pleasant, but the Nigerian version is a
particularly unpleasant one. With impeccable timing, the military
leaders in Lagos have thrown down the gauntlet to the Commonwealth
leaders -- whose summit begins in New Zealand today -- with the
confirmation of the death sentences on the writer, environmentalist and
Ogoni activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of his fellow members of the
Movement for the Survival of Ogoni Peoples (MOSOP). Two of the men,
MOSOP president Saro-Wiwa himself and Dr Barinem Kiobel, are Amnesty
International prisoners of conscience.
Convicted of murder at the end of October in what Amnesty described as
''grossly unfair and politically motivated trials'' Nigeria's military
leader, General Abacha, has clearly used the cases as a way to try to
get rid of the thorn in his side which MOSOP and its president
represent.
Particularly galling for the government has been the organisation's
non-violent campaign against environmental damage caused by oil
exploitation in southern Nigeria and for more autonomy for the Ogoni
people in Rivers State in the south-eastern part of the country.
That in itself was dangerous enough for the regime. But the much
greater risk was that if MOSOP were to be successful in its campaign, it
would set a precedent for other minorities who are as much concerned as
the Ogoni about protecting the environment and traditional industries
such as fishing from the pollution brought by the oil companies, but who
have been more cautious in pursuing that cause.
The Ogoni have also been in the forefront of a campaign to force the
government to share out oil revenues more equitably.
As a result, the military has cracked down hard on the Ogoni. Amnesty
cites allegations of torture or ill-treatment not only against those on
trial, but extrajudicial executions and the destruction of villages and
homes in Ogoniland. Another human rights organisation Human Rights
Watch/Africa has presented evidence of soldiers shooting unarmed
villagers, raping women and burning homes.
The environmental organisation Greenpeace had sight of a Nigerian
government memo which summed the policy up in the clearest terms:
''Shell operations still impossible unless ruthless military operations
are undertaken for smooth economic activity to commence.''
Oil is one of the key elements in the equation. Nigeria has about one
per cent of the world's proven petroleum reserves and they are similar
in quality to North Sea oil. It is Nigeria's key export, accounting for
more than 80% of its foreign income.
The oil giant Shell, which produces half of the country's daily
output, has been a particular target of the campaign against the
environmental depredation caused by the exploitation of this valuable
resource. The oil companies stand accused of failing to clean up after
themselves.
Shell ceased operations in Ogoniland in 1993 after civil disturbances
there. Yet if the intention of the government crackdown was to pacify
the region and persuade Shell to return there, it has failed so far.
The oil company, which has added its voice to those who have spoken
out against the death sentence, has no plans to resume operations in
Ogoniland, according to the managing director of its Nigerian
subsidiary.
In a realistic assessment of the difficulties the company would
continue to face if it decided to go back without local consent, he said
yesterday: ''We can only go back there if all the communities want us
back and the area is still economically attractive.''
Shell International was quick to align itself with the ''quiet
diplomacy'' course being advocated by the South African President Nelson
Mandela rather than the calls for more drastic action such as expulsion
from the Commonwealth.
The Nigerian regime has shown itself immune to any pressure except
where it hurts: economic sanctions and international isolation. Last
month General Abacha commuted the death sentence on alleged coup
plotters after the threat of international sanctions and exclusion from
the Commonwealth summit. That, coupled with intercession by leading
international statesmen such as Nelson Mandela, brought results.
General Abacha also presented a timetable for the restoration of
democracy last month, which anyone who is aware of the abysmal record of
successive military governments in this respect will have regarded with
a great deal of scepticism.
Certainly, the internationally respected Nigerian writer and exile
Wole Soyinka has no doubts about what course to take: ''It is important
to take decisive action of a nature which will terminate this toying,
this sadistic cat-and-mouse game which Abacha is playing with the
Nigerian people, with the international community as audiences -- and
sometimes, I regret to say, as complacent collaborative audiences.''
Soyinka has precedent on his side in arguing for strong action to stop
what Ken Saro-Wiwa's son has described as the ''horrific inevitability''
of the events likely to end with the death of his father and the eight
other activists unless the international community intervenes.
An oil embargo would be a first step. The Commonwealth is divided over
what course to pursue, but if the international community dithers much
longer, it will be too late.
In Soyinka's words: ''Believe me, in another few weeks there will be
yet another atrocity committed by Abacha's regime, deliberately
manufactured, structured to obliterate the memory of Ken Saro-Wiwa, if
we do not wake up to his pattern of inhuman outrages.'' The Ogoni would
agreed.

AT the Scottish Motor Show, the most valuable car is not for sale, is
valued for insurance purposes at a derisory #3 million and, at auction,
would almost certainly set a world record price far above anything
offered in the boom years of the Eighties for such challengers as
Bugatti Royales. AX 201 is the original -- and only accurately titled --
Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost.
Three people contributed to the Rolls-Royce company name, one of them
only as a punctuation mark. The Hon Charles Rolls, whose mother was a
Maclean of Duart, was an aristocratic motor dealer through whose London
showrooms the cars were originally sold.
Henry Royce was a brilliant, pernickety engineer. Trained in the Great
Northern Railway workshops, he moved into electrical engineering and
then into motor-cars, completing the first 10hp Royce in 1904. Far from
enjoying the silver-spoon childhood of his eventual partner Rolls, Royce
had a miserable early life, his failed mill-owning father having died in
the poorhouse.
Claude Johnson -- ''the hyphen in Rolls-Royce'' -- had been the
founding secretary of the organisation which is now the RAC, and joined
Rolls's motor dealership. After Rolls met Royce, the former excitedly
describing the latter as ''the greatest engineer in the world''. Rolls,
Royce and Johnson decided to set up a manufacturing company.
Rolls-Royce Ltd was founded in March, 1906. Johnston was its managing
director and driving force until his death 20 years later.
Royce's 40/50hp design, which first appeared in 1907, was the best car
in the world at the time. AX 201 was the 13th of the line, allocated to
Johnston himself, and fitted with the magnificent Barker body it still
wears today, complete with eye-catching silver plate. Johnston
christened it ''The Silver Ghost''.
As well as using it for business journeys and holidays, he submitted
AX 201 to some gruelling tests. It performed well in the 1907 Scottish
Reliability Trial, and immediately after that in an RAC-observed
endurance trial of 14,371 miles, which ended only when the RAC called a
halt.
After Johnson stopped using AX 201, it was maintained as a
demonstrator, and later became the property of one of the company's
inspectors. Rolls-Royce bought it back in 1949. Still an effortless
performer, it is not only the most valuable, but probably also the most
famous car in the world.

QUALITY consciousness is never more crucial than in the field of
Scottish tourism and the hotel and restaurant trades.
Taste of Scotland has for close on a decade as a non-profit making
company dedicated itself to promoting the highest standards of
hospitality and cuisine in Scotland.
This has been based on a blend of the best modern and traditional
presentations of fresh Scots produce where quality is at the heart of
everything that has been achieved.
The Specal Merit Award for Achievement was given to Argyll's Loch Fyne
Oyster Bar of Cairndaw and co-run by Andrew Lane and John Noble.
Mr Noble said: ''We are very strict in our daily work. One can never
be complacent and quality only becomes routine after a lot of hard work
to get there.''
Every minute detail of hygiene and quality is strictly adhered to,
ensuring the product goes through the smokehouse on to dinner table and
tailormade for the industry, he added.
The initiative's chief inspector Ms Zandra Macpherson said their
ongoing work embraced the entire range of Investors in People, BS5750
and the ISO certificaton range.
''We like to see fresh local produce, good presentation and value for
money. Many people are waking up to the realisation that it is quality
that counts and in recent times Scotland has come far.''
Mr Alan Shiach, the Macallan chairman, said: ''Quality is no abstract.
It represents effort and diligence and what we do is measured against
others. This is how standards are raised.''
Meanwhile Mr Tony Mercer is responsible for quality assurance at the
Scottish Tourist Board, which has in operation a scheme following the
realisation that what the customer requires is objective and trustworthy
guidance for all aspects of a holiday.

FOR the past six months Derek and Ellen Jameson have presented their
late-night Radio 2 chat show from a Radio Scotland studio in Queen
Margaret Drive. The Jamesons were dispatched to Glasgow as part of a
drive to produce more BBC national programmes from regional centres.
Former Fleet Street editor Derek is the nation's best known Cockney.
Ellen was born in Dennistoun, but left as a child to travel the world
with her father, serving in the RAF. Here the husband-and-wife team give
their impressions of Glasgow
THE rocket came out of a clear blue sky and exploded with an almighty
bang at our feet. Mrs Jameson almost jumped out of her skin. I put on my
best English stiff-upper-lip expression and tried to look brave.
Two grinning schoolboys on the pavement outside the Botanic Gardens
gave the game away. Guy Fawkes Day fever. Enough said. Well, not quite.
There was a sudden intervention by a passer-by.
''I suppose you think that was ****** funny,'' he roared. ''I'll be
over there and knock your ****** heads together!''
Our champion, little older than the two pranksters shuffling away,
turned to us with a grin. ''Sorry about the swearie words. It's the only
language they understand.''
A minor incident, but it spells out the difference between Scotland
and the jaded south. Here people are involved in their surroundings.
They are saying This is MY city. They fiercely protect its image and
want you to think only the best of it.
Where I come from nobody gives a damn. Plant a rocket you-know-where
and they would probably look the other way.
When we told friends we were Glasgow-bound there were two distinct
responses. Those who had never been to the place groaned out loud. ''How
awful. We do feel for you.'' Others who knew the city were delighted for
us. ''It's marvellous,'' they said. ''You'll love it there.''
We had our doubts. The image persists of Glasgow as a grim place of
poverty and despair where gangs go around cutting up each other with
razors. In the event, we have never felt safer anywhere. Street violence
certainly exists, but it doesn't touch more than a handful of people.
Rab C Nesbitt says: ''Glasgow's a city that can be anything it chooses
to be. I wish it would choose to be Monte Carlo.''
Well, mate, we've got news for you. We're just back from holiday in
Monte Carlo and, believe it or not, the City of Culture really is miles
better. How they manage to pack so much into it never ceases to astonish
us.
There is much to do, to see and enjoy. More parks, more places to
visit, more restaurants and cafes, more theatres and cinemas, more
everything. Here are a few Glaswegian memories we'll carry with us
forever!
* Kibble Palace in the Botanic Gardens, aglow with bright lights at
the midnight hour. It looks like a flying saucer poised for take-off.
* Scotch broth and ploughman's lunch in the tropical garden at the
People's Palace. Herein lies the heart and soul of Glasgow.
* Dali's Christ of St John of the Cross at the St Mungo Museum. How
clever to put all the religions under one roof, a testament to peace and
harmony.
* The Barras in full cry -- and what joy to learn it's the local
equivalent of my own Cockney barrers. I began working life as a barrow
boy in London's East End.
* Splendid parks at every turn, tree-lined streets, elegant Victorian
terraces. Workers appear from nowhere to trim hedges and cut grass.
We've never seen anything like it.
Glasgow folk are as appealing as their city. Big-hearted, friendly and
so interested -- or could it be nosey? A little old lady came up to me
in Safeway on Byres Road the other day. Here we go, I thought. Do They
Mean Me! Mornin', mornin! Gotcha! which one will she choose? Not a bit
of it. ''Are those teeth your ain?'' she wanted to know.
These are get-up-and-go people. They love talking, laughing, shopping,
getting out and about. The girls are so pretty, stylish and feminine, a
million miles removed from their scruffy grunge sisters in London. There
they wear hobnail boots and pained expressions.
There is a downside to all this. Sadly life cannot be all sweetness
and light. Passions run high among the Celts and in Glasgow we do
occasionally come across conflict.
Like the day we met Dr Michael Kelly, the former Lord Provost, and
talked glowingly to him of his vision in regenerating Glasgow. He
brushed aside our compliments.
Minutes later we were in a taxi and the driver asked the inevitable
questions about how we were finding Glasgow. We told him about meeting
Dr Kelly.
''If I saw that man standing there, I'd run him down,'' said our
cabbie, no longer quite so friendly.
Something to do with football and religion. As a lifelong soccer fan
-- Spurs, of course -- it comes as a shock to find those whose support
depends on where they were baptised. Where I come from it's geography
that matters, which seems a far more sensible arrangement.
Then there is the delicate question of moving about the city. Since
Glasgow very much belongs to the people, why do they go to such lengths
to run them down? Has nobody heard of zebra crossings? True there are
controlled lights, but you could wait forever for that little green man.
Leapfrog across and you get caught halfway with the wife standing on
the pavement angrily wagging her finger. There's no mercy from the
drivers. They go like the clappers in this town. The 30mph speed limit
seems to have gone down the same hole as the zebra crossings.
Public transport services are a mystery. A wonderful Underground
system, but all too often trains are few and far between and limited to
three carriages. It's no great shakes being packed like sardines in one
of those little Noddy coaches. Never mind. There are buses by the score.
Would it be churlish to ask what happens to them after 7 o'clock at
night?
As for taxis -- why do they lock us up in those stuffy steel boxes
until they see the colour of our money? Elsewhere in the world business
with taxi drivers is conducted at the window and on the pavement.
For all that, it's a delight to be here. As they say, life's never
dull in Glasgow. Even the weather has shone down on us since our arrival
six months ago. Glaswegians deliver dire warnings that it cannae last
and, sure enough, it did come down stair-rods the other day.
As my barber Taylor Ferguson said, looking up at the grey skies: ''At
least it's warm rain.''
That's Glasgow. Never say die!

MANUFACTURING and service industries have a golden opportunity to show
the world they are achieving a consistency of quality in product
procedures through the achievement of ISO 9000 certification, fast
becoming the de facto requirement in the marketplace.
More companies are displaying this quality mark to indicate their
products or services have an extra degree of quality. However, ISO 9000
alone does not guarantee either a quality company or product. A whole
range of correct procedures and resources must be put in place to ensure
quality is maintained.
What certification does prove is that a series of specific
requirements have been put in place. ISO 9000 was developed in 1987 by
the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) in Geneva,
which broadly specifies quality procedures in corporate environments.
These procedures were developed as a direct result of the older
British Standard 5750 which also relates to quality. BS5750 was
submitted to ISO as the guideline for a world quality standard and was
adopted through time with just a few alterations.
Conveniently, the European Community standard EN29000 is exactly the
same which means that any organisation achieving the ISO standard range
can quote any or all three standards in their literature. This is worth
remembering.
Mr Glen Barton of Beckman Instruments UK, and the European product
manager for Beckman Laboratory Automation Operations Group, stressed
that ISO 9000 was not an end to itself.
''What it does provide is a living system which can change as a
company grows and changes, providing a continuous loop of re-evaluation
and refinement of procedures.''
After creation of the quality system an inspection agency must certify
that a system meets the standards set forth in ISO 9000. Certification
is not permanent for a company and is subject to periodical reinspection
to prove compliance.
There are, however, some misconceptions about a quality standard which
is considered a panacea to the quality problems which firms face daily.
First of all, the standard demands that a company develops and follows
documented procedures. Normally, a firm uses this development process as
an opportunity to review current business and production processes, with
an eye towards increasing quality.
What should be remembered is that ISO 9000 naturally only increases
consistency, although increased quality is a common result as well.
There is no guarantee that quality will increase.
Also, standardising and documenting quality procedures provides a good
opportunity for reviewing existing procedures to eliminate wasted
effort. Current procedures may include steps that have no effect on
maintaining quality and by removing them valuable time can be saved and
workload decreased.
ISO 9000 works towards increasing the consistency of quality which is
usually construed to mean an improvement in quality. Mr Barton said that
according to quality control legend, Dr WA Deming: ''Good quality does
not necessarily mean high quality.
''What it does mean is a predictable degree of uniformity and
dependability, at low cost, and with a quality suited to the market.''
Quality therefore should be appropriate because ironically, excessive
quality does not always provide benefit to a customer/client, when
balanced with price.
Furthermore, through the magic of quality procedures and standards,
product cost can actually decrease. After going through a total
re-evaluation of procedures, redundant or inefficient steps can be
eliminated.
Also, increasing quality means a decrease in the percentage of a
company's product returned. This is because defects which can directly
reduce product cost are eradicated.
It all adds up to ISO 9000 being just as easily applied to areas such
as product delivery, customer service and technical support. Each
represents a product in itself and is affected by the implementation of
a quality controlling procedure.
What must also be remembered is that today's customer/client often
takes for granted that a supplier is ISO 9000 certified.
To the supplier this means his or her competitive edge from
certification can fade. The standard becomes just the minimum
requirement towards doing business, rather than the differentiation
point.
So certification is still important but does not tell the entire story
and you have got to look behind ISO 9000 to see the real company.
While certification has certainly increased the consistency and
quality of operations in the majority of firms, other factors have to be
considered.
Following what is known as a quality plan on paper does not always
result in increased product quality. One should look behind the
certificate and examine actual procedures which are in place; together
with employees, infrastructure and past experience and success of a
company within its particular sector.
For example, it is important to get to know how well a firm follows up
on quality procedures and whether there are enough people in the
organisation to support a quality system.
Also, are procedures closely followed and proven by written
documentation. What is the company atmosphere like and does the facility
look organised and tidy. Are the people there informed, happy and
qualified?
What is beyond doubt is that ISO 9000 accreditation is a sure sign a
company is thinking quality. This represents a fundamental step giving a
firm that important competitive edge in the marketplace.
Certification is not permanent for a company and is subject to
periodical reinspection to prove compliance
Standardising and documenting quality procedures provides a good
opportunity for reviewing procedures to eliminate wasted effort

IAN CALLUM makes the point that British designers work for car
manufacturers and independent studios all over the world. In fact, we
produce more designers per head of population than any other; but, as
usual, we are feeble at publicising the fact.
Designing, he says, is a very sociable activity. Many of the people
involved have studied together or trained with the same companies.
They meet up at motor shows and discuss each other's work, with
varying degrees of directness. One thing they do not do is over-analyse
design, appreciating that such an approach can stifle it.
If the world motor industry is, as Ian Callum remarks, ''strewn with
British designers'', does that mean they will eventually develop a
British style? He thinks it might come, but from each separate
manufacturer looking for a family image, rather than from individual
designers or studios.
As he points out, ''there is a huge effort on the part of each
manufacturer to develop a philosophy, an ethos for the overall design of
its cars''. BMW is a striking example of this.
In these days of committees and inter-departmental rivalries, a
manufacturer's head of design must have a strong enough position to
fight his team's corner. Luckily for Ian Callum, that is a problem the
head of an independent studio does not have.

The designer's designer grabs motor-show attention again, reports Ross
Finlay
TWO years ago, at the last Scottish Motor Show, one of the stars was
the Aston Martin DB7. This time, there will be interest in the
Mitsubishi Carisma ''evolution'' car. The link between them is that, in
very different degrees, they are both products of the Oxfordshire-based
TWR Design studio headed by Ian Callum.
Born in Dumfries, a student at both the Glasgow School of Art and the
Royal College of Art in London, Ian Callum worked for 12 years with
Ford, latterly as manager of the Ghia design studio in Turin, before
being invited to set up TWR Design.
This is one of 40 and more companies within the TWR Group controlled
by another Scot, Tom Walkinshaw, who over the last 25 years has moved
from being a club racing driver to his present position as an
influential figure within the European motoring and motor-sport
industries.
Ian Callum was given a budget, and a free hand in hiring staff. There
is a network of designers around the world who know each other, and each
other's work, very well. Within a year he had exactly the people he
wanted working for him, and TWR Design -- fundamentally a styling
studio, often working in conjunction with TWR Engineering -- was fully
operational in designing the DB7's admired bodywork and interior.
Now, the studio has three designers, plus Callum himself as a hands-on
chief designer; ten permanent modelling staff and the administrative
back-up required. Several projects have been completed and more are
under way.
The biggest is design work on the Volvo coupe and convertible
scheduled for launch in 1997. This is not simply a job for TWR Design in
conjunction with Volvo. Many other companies within TWR are involved,
and the group has taken a shareholding in the Volvo factory at Uddevalla
in Sweden where the cars will eventually come down the production line.
In fact, this is effectively the pilot scheme for the TWR group's
ambition to become the world leader in the research, development and
actual production of ''niche'' models. It is certainly progressing
quickly, with Ian Callum's input assisted by regular visits to Sweden,
and consultations with Volvo's head of design, Peter Horbury, who
happens to be an old friend.
Other work, like the Mitsubishi Carisma evolution car, is taken on by
TWR Design, which is an autonomous element within the group, on an
independent basis. In that case, Colt Car Company, the Mitsubishi
importer for the UK, was conscious that the Carisma went on sale in
Europe some time before its scheduled appearance in British showrooms.
The link between Colt Car Company and TWR Design was, as it happens,
grand prix driver Martin Brundle, who owns a Mitsubishi dealership. When
Colt suggested that the Carisma needed something to spice up its launch
here -- perhaps a special model which implied a motor-racing connection
but also had street style -- Brundle put them in touch with Ian Callum.
Apart from Tom Walkinshaw himself, no one in the TWR group outside the
studio knew anything about the Carisma work, which was completed in a
swift seven weeks - ''a flier of a project'', as Callum describes it.
This is strictly a show-car exercise, although there are engineering
modifications as well as bodywork changes. A replica has already been
ordered, but if it were to be taken any further, the car would need to
be ''mellowed'' for production, made acceptable to customers and street
legal for the authorities.
Ian Callum is conscious that the studio's work represents a small part
of TWR's annual turnover, but also that it can lead to substantial
business for the group. If it attracts a major contract, the way may be
open for considerable input from the engineering and other subsidiaries.
The snag about design studios is that they are very rarely able to
publicise their work in progress. Much of it is confidential, and any
studio which ''leaked'' would soon find itself shunned by manufacturers.
There is also the problem that, as with authors or film producers,
public interest in a design team's finished work comes at the wrong
time. Ian Callum knows how well the DB7 is regarded. Among other
plaudits, it won him the Jim Clark Memorial Award of the Association of
Scottish Motoring Writers. But by the time it first appeared in public,
at the Geneva Show in 1993, he and his team were well away in other
directions. He realises the dangers in people dwelling on projects
already completed.
In a sentence that needs careful reading, he says: ''It's better doing
the work you're recognised for, than to be recognised for the work
you've done.''

HIGH Street sales have picked up sharply on an annual basis according
to the findings of the CBI Distributive Trends Survey for October, but
underlying sales are still considered to be below average for the time
of year.
October's increase is the largest since April and follows a flat
September although it is not as much as retailers had expected.
The survey shows that 44% of retailers believed sales volumes were up
on a year ago, whereas 28% reported them down, leaving a positive
balance of 16%. The three monthly trend now suggests underlying annual
sales have resumed a modestly upward path, albeit below expectations.
Further growth in retail trade is expected in November, but the CBI
points out that expectations have not been fully realised in nine out of
the last 12 months. Moreover, business for the time of year is expected
to remain below average, but to a lesser extent than in the previous six
months. Certainly there is little sign of real consumer enthusiasm as
yet.
The highest volumes increases compared with a year ago were reported
by booksellers and stationers, chemists, household durables sellers,
furniture and carpet stores, and confectionery, tobacco and newspaper
shops. The sharpest year-on-year falls were recorded by specialist food
shops and clothing, footwear and leather stores.
Commenting on the survey, Alastair Eperon, Chairman of the CBI's
Distributive Trades Panel said, ''The upturn in retail sales last month
is encouraging, particularly as it followed weak trade towards the end
of the summer. However, business still remains well below average and
some retail sectors still report volumes down on a year ago.''
He takes some confort, though, that underlying retail sales are once
again ''drifting up.'' It is to be hoped that the competitive trading
environment is now encouraging previously cautious consumers to step up
their spending in the critical pre-Christmas period, he says.
On the wholesaling side, volumes rose strongly on an annual basis in
October, although the increase was less than that recorded in the
previous two months. Sales for the time of year remained above average,
and orders placed with suppliers continued to grow more strongly than
expected, although again by less than in August and September. In
November, sales volumes are predicted to rise at the same rate as in the
year to October, but business for the time of year is expected to be
only average.
Motor traders experienced a sharp fall in October against the
expectation of a moderate reduction. This left trade well down for the
time of year.
The offical retail sales figures for October are due to be released by
the Central Statistical Office on Wednesday, November 15. These have
frequently diverged from the CBI findings in the past.

SHE was adored by Danes the moment she arrived, and now Alexandra
Manley is one of them. Parliament granted Danish citizenship today to
the British bride-to-be of Danish Prince Joachim.
Miss Manley and her fiance, second in line to the Danish throne, will
exchange vows on November 18 in the nation's first royal wedding in
nearly three decades.
Miss Manley renounced her British citizenship. The 29-year-old
commoner was born in Hong Kong to Richard and Christa Manley.
Last May, Joachim, 26, stunned Danes when he announced their
engagement after a secret romance. They had met in January 1994 in Hong
Kong, where Joachim -- second son of Queen Margrethe -- worked for a
shipping company.
Miss Manley, an economist in a mutual fund management company, left
her job and moved to Denmark this summer.
The wedding will feature royalty and dignitaries from around Europe at
Frederiksborg Castle church, in Hilleroed, north of Copenhagen.--AP.

Washington
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton was meeting his Cabinet today to review plans
to shut down the US Government next week as aides said the chances were
increasing of it defaulting on its debts.
''Default is increasingly likely,'' said White House Press Secretary
Mike McCurry. He noted that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin ''has some
tools that he can use for cash management
. . . but they are limited.''
The federal government faces defaulting on its debts unless Congress
approves raising the federal debt limit.
McCurry said Clinton and his Cabinet would discuss plans to shut down
the federal government next week if Congress does not send him a
temporary funding Bill to sign.
Asked if there was any chance of avoiding closing the government on
Tuesday, McCurry replied: ''There are no chances at this point.''
McCurry said it was unlikely that the looming fiscal crisis would
prevent Clinton from participating in the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation conference in Japan, which starts next week.
Budget brinkmanship is an old game in Washington, which has seen the
government shut down nine ties since 1981 when Congress and the
president each refused to blink in their budget battles.
Never, however, has the fight had such financial importance as for the
first time in its history, the US would not have the authority to borrow
money to pay its bills. A default could lead to lasting damage to US
ability to raise money by selling bonds, and to an increase in mortgage
and credit card rates.--Reuter.

Srinagar
GUERRILLAS holding four Westerners hostage in India's troubled Kashmir
region re-established contact with Indian authorities today after more
than two months of silence.
Officials said the captives had not been harmed.
They lost contact with the guerrillas after September 19, bringing the
crisis that began in early July to a stalemate. The fresh contact
signalled hope again for the captives, facing a freezing Himalayan
winter.
''All of them are safe but one British hostage and the US hostage are
sick,'' said K B Jandial, a spokesman for the government of the state of
Jammu and Kashmir.
''They are being treated well,'' Jandial said. He said the captors
spoke three times to officials by telephone and radio.
''We are treating this as a positive development,'' he said, adding
that the Indian Government hoped they would be freed soon.
Jandial did not say which of two Britons, Paul Wells or Keith Mangan,
was sick. American Don Hutchings and German Dirk Hasert are the other
two hostages who are being held by the Al-Faran group after being
abducted while trekking in the Himalayan region.
The decapitated body of a fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans Christian
Ostroe, was found on August 13 in a remote forest, with a message near
his body that threatened to kill the other captives if Al-Faran's
demands were not met.
Al-Faran, one of the many groups involved in a five-year separatist
uprising against New Delhi, says it will release the hostages in
exchange for India's release of 15 imprisoned militants, including three
Pakistanis.
India says it will not release foreigners but can free Kashmiris as
part of a routine review of their status.
Pakistan, which fought two of its three wars with India over Kashmir,
denies Indian charges that it is arming separatists in the valley. The
militants are fighting for independence or union with Pakistan.
New Delhi says it does not plan to carry out a raid to rescue the
kidnapped foreigners. Authorities say they have been able to keep close
track of the kidnappers and the hostages with the help of locals,
including shepherds.
Last month officials said Al-Faran had sought medical aid for the four
hostages and at least one of the captives was then believed to be
suffering from snow blindness.
Hasert was said to be suffering from chilblains, and Hutchings had
contracted conjunctivitis.
Of the surviving hostages, Keith Mangan, 33, comes from Middlesbrough;
Paul Wells, 23, from London; Hutchings, 42, from Spokane, Washington;
and Hasert, 26, from Erfurt, Manchester. Another American, John Childs,
escaped soon after the Britons and Hutchings were captured.
About 12,000 people have been killed in the Kashmir uprising which
seeks the Muslim-majority state's seccession from mainly-Hindu India.
Today India announced plans to proceed with elections in Kashmir
despite a boycott by its political parties.
Farook Abdullah, chairman of the state's largest party and a former
Chief Minister for the state, said: ''We believe that the situation is
not conducive for elections and the gun is still supreme.''--Reuter/AP.

PLO leader visits Leah Rabin to pay condolences.
l Aviv
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, making his first visit to Israel, paid a
surprise condolence call tonight at the Tel Aviv home of Yitzhak Rabin's
widow, Leah.
''He was a hero of peace, but he was also my personal friend,'' he
told her.
''My husband regarded you as his partner in peace,'' she replied.
Israeli officials had asked Arafat to stay away from the funeral of
the assassinated Prime Minister on Monday, saying they feared for his
safety.
An aide to Arafat said the PLO leader flew to Tel Aviv from Gaza and
spent 90 minutes with Mrs Rabin in her heavily-guarded duplex apartment
before returning to the self-rule enclave.
''It was the visit of a hero to the home of a hero,'' said aide Khaled
Salem. ''Although he was advised by Israelis not to attend the funeral
for security reasons, he insisted on personally paying his condolences
to Mrs Rabin.''
Arafat had never visited the Jewish state before, Salem added.
Earlier today, police said they had seized enough weapons at the home
of Rabin's assassin ''to make any terror group proud''.
Police told a Tel Aviv Magistrate Court that a search at confessed
killer Yigal Amir's house near Tel Aviv uncovered an arms stockpile that
included grenades, explosives, and fuses.
Meanwhile police announced the arrest of two more suspects, bringing
the total to five.
Police Minister Moshe Shahal said police believed that a group opposed
to Rabin's peace moves plotted the murder which Amir, a 25-year-old law
student, carried out when he gunned down Rabin at a peace rally on
Saturday.
''We think that there was a connection between a group of persons who
planned and arranged the assassination of the Prime Minister,'' he said.
He said those arrested were linked by university connections. All five
suspects are religious Jewish men. Four are in their 20s and four also
studied at Bar-Ilan, a Jewish religious university near Tel Aviv.
When Amir confessed on Monday, he said he acted alone, angry at
Rabin's policy of swopping occupied land for peace with Palestinians.
However Shahal said: ''Without the infrastructure supplied to him by
other persons, it would have been impossible to assassinate the Prime
Minister.''
Police told the court a search of Amir's house had turned up ''a
stockpile of arms to make any terror group proud: grenades, explosives,
delay mechanisms and fuses, an unprecedented amount,'' army radio
reported.
The assassination was the first of an Israeli leader in
security-conscious Israel's 47-year history.
In court today, the judge ordered Dror Adani, 26, and Ohad Skornik,
23, remanded in custody while police prepare charges.
Security men rushed the two into court. Adani sat in the courtroom and
prayed and Skornik covered his handcuffed wrists with his jacket,
witnesses said. Both denied any wrongdoing.
Earlier this week Yigal Amir was remanded in custody along with his
brother Hagai Amir, 27, and Avishai Raviv, head of a shadowy militant
group called Eyal.
Police suspect Adani, who met Amir at a religious seminary, of
complicity to murder and conspiracy to commit a felony.
They suspect Skornik, a Bar-Ilan law student, of failing to prevent a
felony and conspiring to commit a felony. Israel Radio said he was on
honeymoon in Israel at the time of the murder.
In Amman earlier today, visiting Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind
said the assassination might give Syria and Israel the chance to end a
deadlock in peace talks.
He told reporters on arrival from talks in the Gaza Strip with Arafat
that Israel and Syria, which he also visited, were committed to the
four-year-old Middle East peace process.
''There is a lot of misunderstanding and mistrust between Syria and
Israel, so inevitably progress will be slow, but it may be that some
opportunity has opened up and both countries might wish to take it,''
said Mr Rifkind, who pledged #7m in new aid to the
Palestinians.--Reuter.

'Scotland has been quick to realise the potential of the call-centre
industry' --Francis Shennan reports on an employment-boosting
phone-omenon.
IMAGINE a device that cancelled out Scotland's greatest business
disadvantage and allowed all its advantages as a place to work and
invest to come into play. Well, that device was invented more than a
century ago.
It can cancel out Scotland's distance from the main markets in the UK
and Europe and allow companies to take advantage of lower-cost office
space, the availability of high-quality workers, and the quality of life
and infrastructure here.
However, it has taken the development of software and computer systems
to allow the telephone to do all that; but now Scotland is gaining
rapidly from one of the fastest growing areas of employment in the 1990s
-- the telephone service centre.
These centres can be either call centres, selling to and handling
inquiries or requests from customers, or internal company service
centres, handling back-office functions. Both, though, tend to go under
the generic name of ''call centres''.
More than 10,000 people are already employed in call centres of
different types, according to figures from Scottish Enterprise. They
range in size from the dozen people employed at the Telecom Service
Centres on Bute to the 1000 at the Bank of Scotland's Management
Services Division in Edinburgh.
Their locations stretch from Hamilton to Thurso. The companies
concerned range from Registers of Scotland and the Student Loans Company
to Barclays Stockbrokers and Littlewoods Pools.
And the functions they carry out are just as varied. They enable
customers to do everything from paying their bills, and checking their
bank accounts to buying goods and services by phone.
Call centres can be used to handle satellite TV subscriptions, as in
BSkyB's centres in Livingston and Fife, which between them employ 1500
people. In Edinburgh, Adobe provides a computer program helpline, and
the Visa centre at Dunfermline handles credit card enquiries.
Glasgow alone has Direct Line Financial Services selling mortgages and
loans; Abbey National Direct selling mortgages and pensions; Stakis
plc's central reservation office for hotel bookings; the RAC's breakdown
recovery service; directory inquiry services for both BT and Mercury
Communications; Hambro's share-dealing service; a National Insurance
helpline for the Contributions Agency; and Great Universal Stores'
catalogue home shopline.
Microsoft, the world's largest software company, commissioned Teledata
Ltd to create a #500,000 dedicated telephone sales and information
centre based in Glasgow. At the start of this year the BBC set up its
helpline in the city to give advice and information to callers from
across the UK on issues raised by programmes on all its national radio
channels.
British Airways gained staff stability by having its 460-employee
Telephone Sales Centre in Glasgow. The staff turnover average is 3% to
4% compared to the 35% it was at Heathrow.
The TSB's #15m PhoneBank Centre in Glasgow, which Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth officially opened eight weeks ago, is the company's
largest single investment in Scotland, which was won by Locate in
Scotland working with Glasgow Development Agency.
''A skilled and flexible workforce, together with one of the most
advanced and comprehensive telecommunications networks anywhere in
Europe, has made Scotland the obvious choice for a number of prestigious
telemarketing and phone banking operations,'' said Mr Forsyth.
TSB's 24-hour telephone banking and mortgage service, based at
Atlantic Quay, deals with more than 500,000 customers. It began
operations in spring and employs 200 people, but that figure is expected
to rise to 950 and it is intended to be the largest telephone banking
and insurance operation in Europe.
Call-centre operators have to be skilled in selling the company's
portfolio of products or in providing customer service advice so that
the caller is dealt with efficiently and has his or her business dealt
as far as possible in one call.
''One of the major factors in the decision to locate in Glasgow was
that the city has the kind of high-quality workforce required to run
this kind of operation efficiently and effectively,'' says GDA chief
executive Stuart Gulliver.
''We now have programmes in place to ensure that there is a continuing
supply of people with the skills necessary for carrying out this kind of
valuable, job-creating operation in the city.''
By January a new #2.7m telesales centre for BT will be in operation in
Motherwell, creating 170 jobs. And call-centre jobs can be high value.
The staff at Motherwell, nearly all recruited locally, will earn between
#14,000 and #21,000 a year.
They will look after one million business customers throughout the UK,
providing information on BT products and services. Less than two years
ago BT chose Glasgow for a similar centre for residential customers,
which created 150 jobs.
Motherwell won the centre, with help from Locate in Scotland and the
Lanarkshire Development Agency, against competition from Preston, Milton
Keynes and existing BT centres at Skelmersdale in Lancashire and
Chiswick in London.
''We already have operators answering directory calls from London in
Stirling, Bathgate, Kirkcaldy and Inverness,'' says BT's National
Manager for Scotland, Bill Furness.
A recent survey by Corporate Locations magazine listed Scotland among
the top locations for call centres but the same technology that has
allowed it to take a lead can benefit rival locations too.
Scotland faces competition from countries such as Ireland, the
Netherlands and even Denmark, where standards among those speaking
English as a second language are high enough for them to compete with
native speakers. Customers of Hewlett Packard, for example, have a
telephone helpline in Amsterdam, although the company has a
manufacturing plant in West Lothian.
Telephone technology means that customers can be offered calls free or
at local rates, even if they are calling from another country.
To help Scotland maintain its lead, the Inaugural Scottish Call Centre
Conference, organised by the GDA and Aspen Consultancy, was held in
Glasgow in July when it attracted more than 200 executives from the
industry.
''Scotland has been quick to realise the potential of the call-centre
industry,'' says John McCann, of the GDA's Business Location Service.
''We can offer potential operators an established support structure with
a wealth of experience and expertise in the sector.''

PROGRAMMES from The Learning Zone may be recorded and used as
educational or training material only under a licence from the
Educational Recording Agency (ERA) or the Open University. These bodies
exist to protect copyright and to ensure recorded material is used
correctly.
ERA is made up from several organisations, including BBC Worldwide
Ltd, Channel Four Television Corporation, British Actors' Equity
Association and The Mechanical Copyright Protection Society Ltd. Once a
licence is granted, educational establishments can record any radio,
television or cable broadcast of ERA's members for educational purposes.
''Most schools and colleges are already licensed,'' says Bernadette
McCarrigle at the ERA. ''To get a licence you must have registered
students on the premises. Once you have obtained your licence you can
record and use anything you like, except Open University.''
The OU operates its own licensing procedures. Both educational and
non-educational institutions can use its material, provided they first
obtain a licence from Open University Educational Enterprises Ltd.
Organisations allowed to use recordings include Local Education
Authorities and any establishments covered by them, universities and
colleges, schools of nursing and certain vocational or professioal
training institutions, such as the Civil Service College or the Fire
Service College.
Training organisations are not allowed to use recordings for
commercial purposes. ''Training organisations are at liberty to record
the programmes as individuals but are not allowed to use them, unless
they can say they are linked to a college or university,'' says
Gerhardt.
There's no way to avoid the rules -- the ERA has a list of all
establishments without a licence and regularly contacts them. ''We write
or telephone, which is usually enough,'' says McGarrigle. ''The list is
decreasing all the time.''
* The ERA can be contacted on (0171) 436 4883.

BANK of Western Australia (BankWest), soon to be purchased by Bank of
Scotland, announced record profits yesterday, but these will be mostly
retained by its present owner, the state Government of Western
Australia.
BankWest boosted its net profit by 20% to $A99.2m (#47.2m) during the
year to September 30, successfully weathering a downturn in Australian
mortgage business because of its strength in business lending.
Stripping out exceptional items in 1994-95, the latest figures are
even more impressive, showing a 38% advance in net profits.
Bank of Scotland announced in September that it had agreed to buy
BankWest for #437m, with the aim of floating off a 49% stake for at
least #202m by the end of February.
It is due to formally assume control of BankWest, which controls
nearly a quarter of all lending and deposits in Western Australia, on
November 30.
Bank of Scotland said the excellent results of the Perth-based bank
were no surprise and the flotation should go ahead on schedule.
''They are in line with our expectations and we are continuing to
prepare the prospectus,'' said general manager Robin Browning.
BankWest managing director Warwick Kent said: ''BankWest is one of the
leading banks for the West Australian business sector and our leading
position in this market has insulated us from the slowdown in house
lending over the last year.''
''We are looking forward to the sale and the subsequent 49% public
share offer, which we anticipate will be finalised before February 29,
1996,'' added chairman Ian Mackenzie.
BankWest's entire second half profit of $49.5m (#23.6m) will be paid
to the Government of Western Australia, bringing its full-year dividend
from the bank to $A74.3m (#35.4m).
The City was sceptical when Bank of Scotland's announced its decision
to buy an Australian bank instead of going for a UK building society,
but banking analyst Mike Trippett at broker SBC Warburg said the
BankWest results showed it had been a good buy.
''The results support what everybody probably suspected, that it is a
very solid business, but for some people it still looks strategically
out. I'm not sure if its is going to change their perception of it,'' he
said.
Mr Trippett said many investors regarded Bank of Scotland as a UK
regional bank and were suspicious of any move by it into new areas.
''They want to think of Bank of Scotland as a Scottish clearing bank
and forget that 50% of its business comes from England and that it owns
a merchant bank,'' he said.
The record profits at BankWest should make it easier for Bank of
Scotland to realise its target of #202m when it floats off a minority
stake in the bank early next year.
Bank of Scotland needs this income to keep its ''tier 1'' capital
ratio, which dictates the amount it can lend, from falling below 6%.
However, should the flotation price fall below expectations, Bank of
Scotland has said it would be happy to continue owning more than 51% of
the BankWest.
Bank of Scotland already owns Countrywide Banking Corporation in New
Zealand. It hopes that the acquisition of BankWest will be a springboard
for further expansion into the ''young dragon'' economies of the Far
East.
Bank of Scotland shares closed down 1p at 251p.

WORLD CUP OF GOLF
SCOTLAND, bidding to add the #1m World Cup to the Alfred Dunhill Cup
title they captured at St Andrews last month, made a promising start to
their campaign in Shenzhen, China, yesterday.
Sam Torrance and Andrew Coltart, two of Scotland's Dunhill Cup heroes,
shot a combined six-under-par first-round total of 138 to lie joint
third, five behind leaders the United States in the 32-nation event.
Torrance, second in this season's European Order of Merit behind Colin
Montgomerie -- who is missing this event to play in Japan this week --
led the way with a four-under-par 68 while Coltart carded a 70.
''Even though the course is not that difficult you tend to play a bit
tentatively in the first round,'' said Torrance. ''We will really give
it a rip tomorrow.''
England, Wales, and Ireland all finished on 141, three shots behind
Scotland who head the home challenge. Each partnership recorded a 68 and
a 73 for their total.
Americans Fred Couples and Davis Love carried on their passionate
affair with the event as they set about landing their fourth successive
title.
But although Love shot a seven-under-par 65 and Couples a 68, the
Americans had to concede individual honours on the day to 30-year-old
Japanese professional Hisayuki Sasaki, who recorded a 10-under-par 62
for a World Cup record by one stroke.
The American pair took a three-shot lead over the Swedish duo of
Jesper Parnevik and Jarmo Sandelin.
Australia's Robert Allenby and Brett Ogle, and Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty
and Tony Johnstone were alongside Scotland, two shots further back.
Japan shared sixth place with Canada on 139 after Sasaki beat the
previous low score of 63 held jointly by Jack Nicklaus, Australia's
Roger McKay, Ulsterman David Feherty and Couples.
Sasaki, winner of this year's Japanese PGA title, had seven birdies on
the outward half for a 29 and came back in 33 thanks to four more
birdies. Unfortunately, his partner, Hiroshi Goda, had a 77.
Love also revelled in the benign conditions to reach the turn in
six-under-par 30 thanks to four birdies and an eagle 3 at the 531-yard
sixth. But a double bogey at the thirteenth, where he three-putted,
undid some of the good work although he managed three more birdies for
his 65.
''We kind of hit the wall at the eleventh when we realised how slowly
we were going. We stalled then but finished with some good birdies,''
said Love after their six-hour round.''
For Sweden, Parnevik, who shot 67, and Sandelin with 69 were pleased
with the way they combined over the 7102-yard Nicklaus-designed course.
European Tour Rookie of the Year Sandelin said: ''I was very relieved as
I left my driver on the bus four days ago,but got it back today.''
New Zealanders Frank Nobilo and Michael Campbell, the second
favourites, posted a two-under-par total of 142 to lie joint fourteenth.

SHARES in Dorling Kindersley, the CD-ROM and book publisher, were hard
hit by news that Microsoft plans to sell its 17.9% stake in the
business. Dorling's shares have been buoyed up in the past by
speculation that Microsoft might bid for the whole company. The sale, to
be handled by Goldman Sachs, is not expected to have much bearing on
Dorling's trading which is said to be in line with the board's

WORRIES about boardroom succession resurfaced at electronics giant GEC
yesterday. This followed the surprise resigantion of Richard Reynolds,
chairman of GPT, its telecommunications joint venture. GPT is 60% owned
by GEC and 40% owned by the German electronics giant Siemens.
Many large instutional investors in GEC would like to see greater
non-executive director involvement in decision-making at GEC which
remains firmly in the grip of Lord Weinstock who has been in charge for
33 years. City analysts are hoping to hear plans on future management in
about a month's time when GEC's results are published.

CLYDE Blowers, the Glasgow-based specialist engineering group which
has enjoyed a 23% increase in its share price during the last four days,
trebled annual pre-tax profits as a result of its recent move into
materials handling, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The company's shares, which had risen from a pre-weekend close of 158p
to 193p before yesterday's results, added another 2p to 195p, having
retreated from an intra-day high of 220p.
Shareholders were rewarded with a 33% rise in the total dividend for
the year to end-August to 6.0p, after a final payout of 4.0p.
Pre-tax profits leapt from #521,000 to #1.56m. At the operating level,
Clyde Blowers turned a #133,000 loss from continuing operations into a
#1.03m profit.
Turnover from continuing operations was up 60% at #27.7m. A net
exceptional gain of #448,000 compares with one of #603,000 the previous
year.
Clyde Blowers' recent move into the production of pneumatic conveying
equipment, which moves anything from grain to nuts and bolts, is paying
rich dividends.
Pneumatic conveying was the driving force behind the vast improvement
in Clyde Blowers' fortunes, with turnover on this side of the business
up 152%.
This was largely down to a full-year's contribution from
Doncaster-based Simon Macawber, which was acquired in May last year.
During the 12 months to end-August, the business of Clyde Blowers'
Sturtevant factory in Brighton was transferred to Doncaster.
Clyde Blowers, which has ambitions to move into other areas of
materials handling, is expected to announce the acquisition of
Nottingham-based batching and weighing equipment manufacturer Richard
Simon from Dobson Park Industries within the next couple of weeks. The
purchase, likely to cost about #2.5m, should be financed out of cash.
However, benefits from the closure of a manufacturing facility in
Belgium, and the resultant centralisation of Clyde Blowers' UK
soot-blowing business at its new head office site in Glasgow, are taking
longer to feed through than some had expected.
Clyde Blowers expects soot-blowing to contribute only modest operating
profits in the current year but envisages a significantly-improved
performance in the next two to three years.
Soot-blowing, until recently Clyde Blowers' sole business, now
accounts for only about one-quarter of turnover.
Its importance in the context of the company's overall operation is
likely to diminish further as Clyde Blowers attempts to increase its
share of the much larger materials handling market.
Chairman Jim McColl said: ''We are quite excited by the prospects. We
are looking forward to another really good year.''
The company, which makes 70% of its sales overseas, sees stable demand
for its product, helped by the advent of new industrial capacity in
developing Far Eastern countries.
Clyde Blowers, because it is a relatively small company, is off the
radar screens of many investors. However, in the run-up to its results,
a few of these investors would appear to have turned their attention to
it.
Even after this week's leap in its share price, Richard Andrews,
analyst at Edinburgh-based stockbroker Bell Lawrie White, is maintaining
his ''buy'' stance. He forecasts pre-tax profits of #2.3m in the current
12 months, rising to #2.7m the following year.

FIFE Flyers' move to bring forward Les Millie back to Kirkcaldy from
British champions Sheffield Steelers has hit a hitch.
The Scots are desperate to land the Great Britain youth international
before this weekend's crucial on-the-road premier division double-header
at Cardiff Devils tomorrow and Humberside Hawks on Sunday.
Talks started last weekend but last night Kirkcaldy rink manager John
Brady revealed: ''I have been unable to contact Sheffield's management
for three days and they haven't yet quoted me a transfer fee.
''We're keen to have him in our squad for this weekend's games, and
I'm trying to push this forward as fast as I can, but I just can't speak
to anyone. Until I do he remains a Sheffield player.''

BADMINTON
REIGNING All-England champion and world No.3 Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen
will play at the Scottish Open from November 22 to 26 at the Kelvin Hall
International Sports Arena in Glasgow.
The Danish star is one of 85 players who have entered the men's
singles, with only 24 places up for grabs.
Confirmation that Hoyer-Larsen will play comes hot on the heels of
revelations that BBC Scotland slammed the standard of the tournament
when they refused to cover the event.
Anne Smillie, chief executive of the SBU, also revealed that two more
sponsors have been courted on board in a bid to save the endangered
event, one of the top 12 tournaments in the world, from sliding out of
the IBF Grand Prix circuit. Irn Bru and Scottish Mutual have pledged
support worth #5000.

GOLF ROUND-UP
COLIN Montgomerie, who is missing this week's World Cup in China to
play in the #1m Taiheiyo Masters in Tokyo, opened his account with a
first-round 74. The Scot, who clinched his third successive European
Order of Merit title two weeks ago, recorded the same score as world
No.1 Greg Norman, of Australia.
Middlesex player Barry Lane, who finished joint second at the Kapalua
International in Hawaii last weekend, continued his good form by
shooting a 71 which left him three off the pace set by Japan's Toru
Suzuki.
* MASTERS champion Ben Crenshaw capped a ''magical year'' with victory
in the PGA Grand Slam of Golf when he sank a 50-yard chip for an eagle
at the final hole at Kauai, Hawaii to gave him a one-stroke victory in
the 36-hole event reserved for the winners of the year's four grand slam
tournaments.
Crenshaw picked up around #265,000 for a four-under-par total of 140.
Corey Pavin and Steve Elkington tied for second on 141, with John Daly
finishing eight off the pace.
* ENGLAND'S Caroline Hall heads the British challenge at the
Australian Women's Open in Melbourne. A four-under-par first round 69
left her two behind leader Liselotte Neumann, of Sweden.
Scotland's Dale Reid and Emma-Jane Smith of England both went round
the Yarra Yarra course in level par, along with Ireland's Maureen
Magill.
Neumann holds a one-shot lead over American Jane Geddes, with Hall
third. Neumann's compatriot Annika Sorenstam, the holder, is handily
placed on 70.
* BRITAIN'S Ben Jackson shot a 71 in the first round of the Singapore
Open to lie five behind Australian clubhouse leader Stephen Leaney. Play
was washed out with more than 50 players still to complete their opening
rounds.

HOCKEY:
CIBA Kelburne have been dealt a blow as they try to keep pace with the
contenders for the men's league title. Gordon Moore, the team captain
and the side's top scorer with nine goals in eight games, has dislocated
his right shoulder and will be sidelined until after the new year.
The Paisley men have only two matches to play before the mid-season
break, but one is tomorrow against Menzieshill, who are one point behind
leaders Grange -- who have a relatively easy fixture against Clydesdale.
Menzieshill player-coach Bruce Cuthill will have five youngsters in
the side, but are without suspended pair John Christie and Neil Divine.
The match at Auchenhowie between Western and Torbrex Wanderers could
also affect the destiny of the title.
* BONAGRASS Grove have encountered ''the voice of disapproval'' of the
women's competitions committee by declining to play in the national
league without two Great Britain stars Pauline Robertson and Susan
Fraser, who are in Cape Town, South Africa, for the Olympic qualifying
tournament.
The Dundonians are entitled to two postponements because they have two
players on international duty, but are contravening ''a ladies'
agreement'' made last year when it was decided that clubs would fulfil
their fixtures.
Charlotte Jones, Grove's match secretary, said: ''We were quite
prepared to fulfil the agreement until we heard that another club had
postponed their games.''
The most attractive match in the league tomorrow will be between
holders Western Klick Photopoint and Hyndland -- who are separating
Edinburgh Ladies and Western at the top of the table.
The men's competitions committee, meanwhile, have come under fire from
the organisers of the European Nations Indoor championship in Glasgow on
January 26 to 28 for scheduling indoor league matches that weekend.

GRAND PRIX
DAMON Hill hit back at reports of rising tension between him and his
Williams team yesterday as pressure mounted on him to finish a troubled
year on a high note. He is determined to end a run of six defeats when
he competes in the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide on Sunday.
''It's bloody annoying. It really is. It's non-stop. There is always
someone trying to pull the rug out or undermine you,'' Hill said when
asked to comment on reports of friction in the Williams camp.
But he added he would rather suffer a barb or two from journalists
than sit by the side of the track and not drive at all.
''I'm prepared to take the rough with the smooth. When you do well,
you pick up the papers and read and see how wonderful you are, and you
are quite happy to accept all that, so I think you have to take the
other half of it when it comes along,'' he said.
Hill, 35, also was not going to let the media get the better of him.
''I think it's a high profile sport and in a way it's great that you've
got a sport that provokes so much comment . . . the downside to that is
that you have to perform well otherwise you take a lot of the stick,''
he said. ''I'd rather be taking stick from not winning a Grand Prix than
not taking any stick, just standing on the side and watching it.''
Hill has been under the spotlight following several collisions and the
loss of the Formula One championship to Michael Schumacher, whose
Benetton car is considered inferior to Hill's Williams machine.
The 26-year-old German led Benetton to their first constructors' title
two weeks ago in the Japanese Grand Prix just seven days after landing
his second consecutive drivers' title at the Pacific Grand Prix at Aida,
Japan.
The back-to-back wins in Japan lifted him level with Nigel Mansell in
the record books with nine victories in a single season, a mark he hopes
to shatter in Australia.
But Hill's determination promises a tough battle.

We're simply trying to reconstruct everything
that commentators have deconstructed over the years
BOSS GROOVES
After the successes and disappointments of more than a decade, David
Belcher finds the Pastels at home with their 1995 contemporaries
YOU might imagine you know all you need to know about the Pastels.
After all, they've been around Glasgow long enough for opinions to have
formed, if not become fossilised. Is it 11 or 12 years since they came
into being? All three band-members claim to be unsure.
''Our actual date of birth isn't imprinted on my memory in flaming
numerals,'' says Stephen Pastel with trademark vagueness, absently
curling a lock of his hair round one finger. ''We're not that kind of
band. Things just stumble in at no fixed point.''
It's statements such as that which some Glasgow music-biz movers and
shakers find infuriating. They decry the Pastels for being studiedly
whimsical. For wilfully cultivating an air of adolescent disaffection.
For having claimed squatter's rights on the moral high ground in the
eternal pop debate between art and commerce.
Other folk would put it more simply: the Pastels? Canny sing. Nae
chunes.
Well, fie on such balloons and their tiny minds and their stopped-up
ears. Let them step into eternity accompanied by the straining strains
of Wee Wee Wee and Deacon Brodie.
The no-tunes allegation is the easiest one to dismiss. The Pastels'
current album, Mobile Safari (on the Domino label), has a stack of
inventive melodies. Neat songs about the joys of pop. Satirical attacks
on self-delusion. Guitar-y bits which overwhelm without being pompous.
Surprising trumpets. And one track, Worlds of Possibility, recorded with
One Dove groovemeister Ian Carmichael, is something that Everything But
The Girl would give their eye teeth for.
Granted, the album does feature occasional moments of
deliberately-atonal waywardness, but you'd have to be deaf not to
recognise Mobile Safari as the Scottish album of 1995.
That has certainly been obvious to more people round the world than
ever before, Mobile Safari having become the Pastels' all-time
best-seller. It reached number one in one Spanish national album chart.
''It was nice to see us ahead of Tricky and P J Harvey . . . although
I'm certain the chart wasn't based entirely on sales figures,'' Stephen
admits.
You didn't know any of that, did you? Aye, right now the Pastels'
career is on an upward curve, and there are many new and rather wondrous
facets to the Pastels.
For instance, Stephen Pastel has become a bona fide Japanese tourist
shrine. Or at least his daily non-Pastel workplace has, Stephen being
regularly visited by respectful groups at his post in the record
department of a Glasgow bookshop.
Big in Japan, the Pastels, you see. ''The shop has been entered on a
Japanese music magazine's UK tourist trail. They come in nervously, and
then look awed, shaken and astonished to see I'm actually there behind
the counter. After half an hour of agitated record-browsing, they manage
to compose themselves sufficiently to take pictures of each other
shaking my hand.
''I grin awkwardly and feel flustered. It's particularly embarrassing
when there are other customers who've nipped in for a classical CD. 'Why
has the assistant become involved in this bizarre ritual of
camera-flashes and frozen smiles?' ''.
There's an equally-bizarre ritual that the Pastels have avoided of
late: running away from success.
''We became really frustrated after the relative failure of the
Sittin' Pretty album because we knew that a lot of what had gone wrong
was our fault. Our previous LP, Up For A Bit, had been the record of the
moment . . . I remember buying the three music weeklies on the same day
and they all had over-the-top reviews and features. Weird.
''We should then have started to play live more often and reach more
people, do the normal things more career-minded bands do. Instead, we
went into hibernation. We didn't see what a golden opportunity it was.
''It was all a rehearsal for now.0 I think Glasgow has become a lot
more healthy. We've always had an affinity with Teenage Fanclub, and
their commercial successes have been encouraging. We feel a kinship with
newer bands such as Ganger and Telstar Ponies. And despite the fact that
One Dove and the Pastels are musically worlds apart, we felt we could
connect with Ian Carmichael because he's smart and he's open-minded, and
because we've all grown up in Glasgow under a similar set of
experiences.''
The Pastels yesterday set off for their second US visit of the year, a
nine-date tour which will take them from Chicago to New York via Canada,
supporting Yo La Tengo. Their van will be skilfully piloted by gritty
speedway ace David Walsh, the current captain of the Glasgow Tigers team
as well as a man whose motorcycling career has received sponsorship from
the Pastels.
His exploits at the wheel are unlikely to be as frightening as the
Pastels' experiences at the big College Music Journal conference earlier
in the summer in New York. The CMJ is America's largest talent-broking
shindig. In addition to performing there themselves, the Pastels saw
legendary troubled genius Brian Wilson play, which was good: ''he's
still eccentric, but without being either sad or mad'', and they met a
host of American music biz types. Which was less good.
''We went to a record-label party with Dean Wareham, who's now with
Luna and who used to be in Galaxie 500, ie, he's lived and worked in New
York for years. When we went in, there was a murmur of ''Pastels'', and
this woman rushed up to Dean and embraced him with the cry: 'I've loved
your work in the Pastels for years!' ''
In the immediate future, the Pastels plan to put another album
together quickly at the start of next year. ''The eighties was all about
complex masterplans entailing three years in a recording studio. Now
it's do it, get it out, move on . . . much healthier. Look at John
Coltrane, he could make five great records in a year.''
Do they have any grander conceptual plans? Stephen ponders. He beams
and chortles. ''We're simply trying to reconstruct everything that
Glasgow commentators such as Pat Kane have deconstructed over the
years.''
So now you know: Pastelism means you don't have to pretend to have
freshly re-invented the wheel as an object with four corners.
* The Pastels' next Scottish appearance is at Barrowland on December
1, supporting Teenage Fanclub.

<RECORDNO>975454424</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE building society movement has been a dwindling one in recent
years, reduced by takeovers and mergers, one major switch to plc status,
and more to come.
It has also brought benefits of one kind or another to those lucky or
shrewd enough to pick those societies likely themselves to be picked
off. Spot the next to go has become quite a game for some.
The present chairman of the Building Societies' Association, Ken
Culley, does not approve of a lot what is going on and expressed himself
quite forcibly at the Association's annual lunch yesterday.
He said the prospects of building societies changing their status have
led to ''windfall gains'' through cash bonuses or free shares. This runs
the risk of creating a ''jam today'' mentality which weighed against the
desirable long-term relationship between members and their society.
Mr Colley attacked what he calls short-term speculators making a
signifcant profit at the expense of genuine members who have built up
the reserves of the society over a long period. In particular, he said
the industry does not want to be hijacked by the bounty hunter, the
speculators, and the asset strippers. Strong stuff.
But of course we are already much of a ''jam today'' society. From the
National Lottery, through to scratch cards, horses, and share markets,
people are gambling away like mad. And the prospect of receiving a nice
bonus from a building society also has its attractions.
Mr Culley, whose own building society is the Portman -- one to watch,
perhaps -- said that despite the existence of legislation to ensure that
only members of at least two years standing should benefit from such
bonuses, recent court cases had highlighted inconsistencies and
loopholes in this two-year rule.
He wants the rules tightened up so that two years means precisely
that. It is probably the best he can hope for.
Looking good
AT some point the underperformance of BT shares will come to an end as
the market comes round to consider that it can cope with increasing
competition and a tough regulatory regime and still keep earnings at
least level-pegging.
There is little chance of the present formula for prices, which
specifies inflation minus 7[1/2]%, being changed until the next review
in July 1997 however much the group might complain. But competitors are
also finding it difficult to push profits ahead and there is a
reasonable chance of the cap being relaxed in 1997. This possibility
will begin to have a beneficial influence on the share price next year.
In addition, BT is one utility which stands positively to benefit from
a Labour election victory if the latter's plan to allow the group to
send entertainment programmes down its wires in exchange for
establishing an information ''superhighway'' is maintained.
If it can remain in Labour's good books, this promises to be a major
moneyspinner for BT. However, the regulator, Don Cruickshank, is known
not to be keen and so could be tougher in other areas.
For all the headlines of BT making 102p a second, the group has
generally managed to avoid the bad publicity which has hit other
utilities and on the whole has done a good job in balancing the needs of
shareholders and customers.
In this it has benefited from technology which is steadily cutting the
cost of telecommunications enabling manpower to be reduced, fortunately
on a voluntary basis.
BT's interim dividend is going up 5.7%, a little short of the 6% we
have been used to, but with a strong balance sheet this rate of increase
looks sustainable which makes an existing 6.2% yield even more
attractive. Purchases around the present share price are unlikely to
prove a bad investment.
Cautious chief
THERE can be no doubting the fact that Burton Group has travelled far
down the road to recovery. However, it still has some way to go to
emulate the performance of rivals such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Next.
From being a basket case on the High Street having almost constant
sales it has transformed itself into a group for which people are
increasingly prepared to pay full price. This is particularly the case
in its flagship, Debenhams.
The improvement at Debenhams has come about from a combination of
factors including improvements in the supply chain which have led to
better in-store stock availability and strong and growing own brands
such as, Trader jeanswear, Casual Club and J Taylor for women.
In teaming up with several well-known designers such as Lulu Guinness
and Ben de Lisi, J Taylor has succeeding in attracting in a new upmarket
clientele who, would not traditionally have shopped at Debenhams.
The lessons learned at Debenhams are steadily being implemented in the
multiples businesses which are all, to varying degrees, improving the
quality of their brands and the overall in-store shopping atmosphere.
Despite the group's strong sales growth in the first nine weeks of the
current financial year, chief executive John Hoerner is cautious.
He is probably right to be cautious given the fragile state of
consumer confidence even before we know the contents of the Budget.
There is a danger that any prolonged weakness in demand in the run-up to
Christmas, the most important trading period of the year, could prompt
some retailers to cut prices in order to boost trade.
Having spent so much time and effort getting customers to pay full
price for its merchandise Burton is understandably reluctant to get
involved in any price war which could damage its margins.
However, as a volume retailer with 135 of the UK clothing market it
can ill afford to stand aside and ignore the competition. The company is
due to publish a trading update at its annual meeting on January 25.
This will show whether Mr Hoerner was justified in his caution.

THE 6.75-litre V8 engine which has powered Rolls-Royce and Bentley
cars since the late Fifties is approaching the end of its production
life. While it can cope with short-term emission regulations, and in
turbocharged form gives these heavy cars tremendous straight-line
performance, the time has come for a change.
Until quite recently, Rolls-Royce was fairly snooty about power
outputs. ''Adequate'' was the response to any questions about them.
However, since power statistics had to be revealed in Germany, there was
no point in not fully informing the UK public any longer.
In fact, the turbocharged engine as fitted to the Bentley Turbo R,
Continental R and Azure Convertible peaks at 385bhp. And it produces an
almost unbelievable 553lb ft of torque.
Scare headlines that Rolls-Royce will eventually fit BMW engines
suggested that this was some kind of down-grading.
The reality is rather different. Teams from Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and
Cosworth Engineering -- both members of the Vickers group -- are already
working in conjunction with BMW designers. As matters stand at the
moment, there is likely to be a normally-aspirated V12 engine and a
higher performance turbocharged V8.
With those three companies all contributing their expertise,
Rolls-Royces and Bentleys built after the millennium should have engines
of a majestic specification which would have satisfied Royce himself.

CHECK-OUT
ONE of the Booker selections may be on your shopping list -- but you
could find more rewarding reading from another new title, that's
massively discounted. In fact, the Visa Delta Shopping Handbook is free
to Check-Out readers.
According to the UK's most widely-accepted debit card, the chapter and
verse in their guide is essential reading for Scots about to go on a
Christmas binge: in a survey for National Consumer Week, ending today,
half those questioned said they knew ''little or nothing at all'' about
their rights. One in six Scots even thought they could not get their
money back on a faulty item.
The Shopping Handbook shows how to avoid pitfalls, puts you straight
on your rights and even advises on beating stress while Christmas
shopping. For a copy phone 0171-231 5432.
Open money
IF you still prefer old-fashioned cash, be on the alert for dud notes:
a flood of seasonal money overwhelming tills and doubts about the
effectiveness of detector equipment are a gift to counterfeiters.
Police are reminding shopkeepers to be on guard against suspicious
notes, but how do their customers spot one? Check-Out has obtained a
copy of Lothian and Borders' guide for traders.
A genuine note will say ''yes'' to the following questions: does the
main printing feel raised -- can you see a bold and clear watermark when
it's held to the light -- is there a metallic strip or thread -- does
the note feel crisp -- is the print sharp and the colours clear and
distinct?
You may risk store rage holding up the queue while interrogating your
change, but at least you're less likely to be out of pocket . . .
Tin opener
CHECK-OUT offers an unrepeatable prize this week -- it may lack the
allure of a Caribbean holiday for two or a BMW but it is unique -- in
Scotland at least.
Our 23p tin of first-ever British baked beans from Sainsbury's is the
only one north of the Border (unless someone has smuggled in a can from
the half dozen stores in the south of England where they're on
restricted sale).
After we argued that Scots -- who are among the UK's biggest eaters of
baked beans -- should not be denied the opportunity of giving their
verdict, Sainsbury's despatched us a 420g tin.
According to the company, the British climate is one of the obstacles
to a larger crop -- this first trial harvest was developed with growers
in Cambridgeshire.
But Scots farmers acquainted for the first time yesterday with the
concept reckon the baked bean is a runner here, and could slice the
balance of payments by reducing American imports.
John MacNeill, Perthshire NFU area secretary, says: ''The fertile
Carses of Gowrie and Stirling already produce beans and peas for animal
feed. I am sure we could provide excellent beans for Sainsbury's, as
well.''
Our tin of baked beans will go to the first reader out of the can.

Mobile phones open up vital communication lines for businessmen and
families but, warns Jane Scott, there are hidden strings attached
Customers see #15 a month, they don't see 50p a minute
People can use these phones for a month to six weeks -- free
TEN years ago Nick East was a prophet in the wilderness. Halfway
through the ostentatious eighties he opened the first mobile phone shop
in Inverness. Today mobile phone maps detailing availability around the
country show England as a wash of colour, indicating that your phone
will pick up almost anything that moves. Outside the central belt,
however, Scotland is blotched with white, developing severe anaemia in
the North-west; 10 years ago coverage was even more limited.
And yet East's HSW Communications shop prospered. For years he sold
only to businesses -- boats have no problem picking up signals at sea --
but in recent months he has seen the national retailers like Curries and
Dixons muscling in on the action, with sales of mobiles in the Highlands
running up to 300 a month. The strangest phenomenon of all is people who
don't actually need these phones queueing up to buy them.
East says: ''They come in and they say, I want that phone, and I want
the low-user tariff because I'm not going to use it. Then you can see
them two weeks later wandering round the town yacking all the time and
they come in and say, 'Oh God, look at my bill!' They see #15 a month,
they don't see 50p a minute.''
The explosion in mobile phone use reflects the triumph of bold
marketing strategies brilliantly sold to a public more than willing to
kid itself that bargains, like the tooth fairy, really do exist.
Because what you can really expect from your mobile is a series of
costs confounding all expectation; a long and binding contract which
costs hundreds of pounds to break; the very real possibility of fraud
sending your bills up by thousands; and often indifferent or even
non-existent reception. It is not, by any means, a bargain.
That said, the mobile is here to stay, and even those owners who
loathe the things would not want to give them up.
By August this year, says the Department of Trade and Industry, there
were 4.5 million mobiles being used in the UK, providing as many as
50,000 jobs and contributing more than #1000m to the UK's Gross Domestic
Product in 1993. By the turn of the century, there will be more than 12
million phones in use, and the industry will employ 80,000.
It is the expectation of a bargain, deeply implanted by advertising
campaigns, which makes the drawbacks of the mobile phone -- almost
always financial -- so hard to swallow.
Which? magazine has found that a quarter of all mobile phone buyers
regret their choice, and is looking to new DTI regulations to protect
the consumer.
In the past few years, companies supplying the networks and the
handsets have focused on domestic customers, playing on society's fears
(the perceived danger to the lone woman driver who breaks down) and
desire for contact (the commuting husband talking to his pregnant wife).
As the market has grown, the price of handsets has genuinely
decreased, and a phone costing about #400 five years ago will be some
#125 today. But even this cost is concealed under cover of a contract.
In a typical deal from the high-profile, high street company Peoples
Phone, the best-selling Nokia 101 was advertised at #19.99, with line
rental at #12.77 a month.
The handset, a handsome, if hefty, device in purple plastic was
''discounted'' from #99.99. But the buyer must also pay a line-rental
fee for a minimum of 15 months; a year's contract plus three months'
notice period. It is this contract which recoups the true cost of the
handset and, in a further twist, costs #50 to break even after this
minimum period is up and the phone is, to all intents and purposes,
yours. (Clause 15 on the contract; ''An administration charge of #50 is
made in the event of the customer's line being disconnected from the
tariff chosen.'')
The line rental itself will be advertised at a low price; economy
tariff is #12.77 a month.
But you must add on VAT. Then there is insurance; household policies
do not usually cover the handsets, for which there is a thriving black
market (12,500 are stolen in the UK every month). Add on #5 (plus VAT).
Then there is itemised billing; #1.50 (plus VAT); very useful in
checking that your phone has not been ''cloned'' and used by someone
else. These last two are optional, but the cost of merely owning the
phone has leaped from the advertised #12.77 to #22.64. And that's not
counting the #20 (plus VAT) it costs to connect to the network in the
first place.
And now we come to the calls themselves.
Four companies provide the UK's six mobile telephone networks, using
radio signals to transmit calls. All four, Vodafone, Cellnet, Orange,
and Mercury have a digital network (computer coded for better security),
and Vodafone and Cellnet each run an analogue network -- the handsets
for this are cheaper, but people can eavesdrop or use your number to
make calls at your expense.
Not one covers the whole of the UK.
The second successful strategy in selling mobiles to families, after
discounting the handsets, was to introduce ''economy'' or ''low-user''
tariffs on the networks. Business customers pay a high monthly rental,
but they get cheaper calls.
Peak time BT calls cost a maximum of 9.8p per minute; mobile phone
economy calls will cost more than 40p (plus VAT, naturally). On top of
that, most networks charge in minutes or half-minutes, rather than for
the actual time spent talking.
Only Orange, now advertising heavily in Scotland, charges per second.
However, the company's network currently only covers the inner central
belt, and the Orange map fails to even show the top half of the country.
And if you think the calls are expensive, the extra services are a
killer.
Mobiles can be a useful answer phone service, but you must pay to
retrieve the messages people leave for you. Retrieving calls, or even
ringing up to check if you have any messages, means using the network --
and you will invariably be charged according to the tariff you use.
But changes are on their way. New regulations introduced by the DTI in
July will give customers more power to challenge unfair mobile phone
contracts in court, although no cases have so far been mounted.
Another DTI initiative, announced last month is a crackdown on mobile
phone fraud. The most worrying development in the mobile crime racket,
which costs the industry more than #100m a year, is phone cloning.
Dawn Fryer, 31, was given a phone by her father after she was stranded
late one night on the Cathkin Braes when her car broke down.
In the past three months, she has used the phone a handful of times.
But in September, the bill was #377. ''I was in a complete panic,'' she
said. ''I had never heard of phones being cloned, and my father said I
must have left the phone switched on after a call. I said I would pay
every penny of it, but I was sick with worry because I was due to go on
holiday, and I could see the holiday disappearing.''
In fact, Fryer's phone had been cloned. Every time a mobile makes a
call it sends out its own number (Mobile Identity Number -- MIN) and its
Electronic Serial Number (ESN). This information can be picked up on a
scanner or ''grabber'' and programmed into another phone. Every call
made on that phone will be charged to the original customer's bill.
East said: ''Airports and service stations are popular places because
everybody's using mobile phones there all the time.
''They (fraudsters) can sit there for a day and get maybe 100 numbers
and then go away to their dealerships, get a whole load of second-hand
phones that have got no numbers in and put these mobile and ESN numbers
in.
''People will buy these phones on the understanding that they can use
it for a month to six weeks -- free. There is a massive trade in it.''
Then the genuine owner's bill comes in, often run up by thousands of
pounds.
Fryer, reception manager at the David Lloyd club in Renfrew, has
challenged her bill, and is waiting to hear whether she must pay it.
The new DTI measures will put the onus on dealers to prove that the
equipment they buy and connect is not stolen; propose new criminal
offences and extended prison terms, and raise public awareness of the
problem.
But the main losers are, it seems, the service providers, who lose
some #40m a year to fraudsters and sham companies who buy the phones and
then leave the bills unpaid; rough justice, some might call it.
In terms of pure handset performance, Which? recommends the Peoples
Phone CTN 7000 and the Sanyo CMP 351E for the Vodafone and Cellnet
analogue networks, and the Sony CM-D200 for their digital networks. The
phones Which? tested for the Mercury and Orange networks were the
Mercury M150 and M400 and the Orange Motorola MR1, which ''all performed
reasonably''.

THE downturn in the insurance cycle is biting at Royal Insurance, with
third quarter profits well down, additionally impacted by the many
hurricanes which have hit the Caribbean, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
In the three months to September profits fell by 22% to #94m, which
left the shares 15p weaker at 374p, though the strong performance in the
first half still left the nine months' figure 8% ahead at #335m.
With past tax losses used, up the tax charge is rising so earnings per
share were a fraction lower.
With rates coming under pressure, the UK underwriting surplus fell by
a quarter to #70m in the three months. Personal line rates are down 6%
on last year but have not deteriorated since June.
Subsidence claims have doubled to #28m over the nine months and there
was a rise in large property claims.
Another factor was heavy rain in the North-west of England where Royal
has a major presence.
The three recent hurricanes cost Royal #27m, which knocked
international underwriting profits back from #37m to #22m. The third
quarter's series of major weather events was the worst for 30 years.
Certain other operations such as those in Asia and South America
performed strongly.
Third quarter results in the US showed unchanged profits but the trend
is in the right direction with the nine months moving from losses of
#14m to profits of #46m.
Most major lines made progress, reflecting Royal's tighter
underwriting approach and lower weather losses. Canada continued to make
good progress.
Worldwide life operations saw a two-thirds jump in profits over the
nine months to #48m, mostly due to recovery in the US following remedial
action. But UK premium income and new business is continuing to feel the
impact of low consumer confidence.
Single premium business is well down, though new annual premiums are
almost level-pegging. The estate agency losses are being contained
despite a 16% fall in house sales in the nine months.
Better investment conditions have given a strong boost to Royal's net
asset value which now stands at some 379p, up 32% on the start of the
year.

THE Western Samoa team to face Scotland A at Hawick on Sunday will
contain 10 capped players and 10 of the side which beat Edinburgh 35-22
at Inverleith on Wednesday. Of the 10 capped players, six appeared in
the Western Samoa team which defeated Scotland in Apia two years ago,
the last time the two countries met.
The implication of the selection is that the Samoans are using the
first two matches to give the bulk of their likely Test side adequate
preparation before the international with Scotland a week on Saturday.
Significantly, the Samoans are giving a successive outing to the back
row and behind the scrum all but the half-backs, suggesting the
importance of fielding these players together as units.
Moreover, the inclusion of hooker Tala Leiasamaivao and lock Potu
indicates that the Samoans want to improve further what was a useful
understanding between thrower and jumper on Wednesday.
Faitala Talapusi, the Western Samoa manager insisted: ''There are
still places to be played for on Tuesday night. We will make sure that
everyone in the party will have been given a game by the third match and
hence a chance to stake a claim for a test place.''
Commenting on the critical reports the Samoans received from some of
the press for their dangerous tackling against Edinburgh, Talapusi said
that he had discussed the matter with his players during the training
session at Riccarton yesterday. ''My players know that everyone here
will be watching them closely, but it does concern me that some sections
of the press appear to be concentrating on this and not on the more
positive aspects of our play.'' Team:
V Patu; B Lima, G Leaupepe, T Vaega, A Telea; D Kellet, J Filemu; M
Mika, T Leiasamaivao, P Fatialofa, L Falaniko, P Leavasa, S Kaleta, P
Lam (captain), S Vaifale. Replacements -- T Leota, G Latu, S Smith, M
Vaea, C Burnes, S Leaega.
* HERIOT'S FP prop Stuart Paul will face the Samoans twice within five
days after his selection yesterday for the Scotland A.
Paul is the immediate beneficiary of the re-shuffle caused by the
six-week ban imposed on Boroughmuir captain Peter Wright, whose place in
the Scotland side for the Murrayfield Test next Saturday has gone to A
team tight-head Paul Burnell, who will win his forty-first cap against
the Samoans.
* ANDRE Herrero is to quit as French manager following a player
protest just two days before the first Test against New Zealand.
Herrero said he made his decision to resign after a group of players
boycotted an official function hosted by the mayor of Toulouse and made
public a list of grievances instead.
Among their complaints were gripes about their pay and the number of
tickets allocated to each player.
Herero said his resignation would become effective immediately after
tomorrow's match against the All Blacks in Toulouse.
''I cannot accept that the players were attempting blackmail just
before a match,'' said Herrero. ''The players were demonstrating against
federation rules. I cannot accept this. It's unsportsmanlike.''

Given the way the world -- and America in particular -- treats its
leaders, and the nastiness of political in-fighting to become one in the
first place, Patrick Brogan reports from Washington that it is not so
surprising that General Colin Powell has decided the presidential
battleground is no place for a self-respecting soldier
COLIN POWELL will be missed. At his press conference on Wednesday
announcing that he would not run for President, he was eloquent, lucid,
calm, humorous and moderate. He obviously had the personality and the
charisma that the country wants in its leaders and that the present crop
of contenders all so conspicuously lack.
He said he was taking a pass because he had looked deep into his soul
and concluded that he lacked the ''passion and conviction'' needed for a
successful presidential campaign. Obviously, he is the best judge of
that, but equally obviously, it is our loss.
He said he understood and approved the ''down and dirty'' of
presidential politics, but then he deplored the ad hominem attacks
against politicians' characters that often pass for political debate. He
specifically meant American conservatives, who had some very nasty
things to say about him last week.
Nobody knows of any skeletons in his closet, apart from the fact that
his wife needs medication to cope with depression. All the same,
skeletons would have been made for him. Politics is a nasty business
here, and in other countries.
Consider the way the far right is treating President Clinton.
A member of the Mellon family who owns a small newspaper in Pittsburgh
has set up a media foundation whose only function is to spread grotesque
slanders about the President. It accuses him of having his lawyer, who
it says was Mrs Clinton's lover, murdered to cover up the Whitewater
affair. It says Clinton, as governor of Arkansas, was involved in drug
smuggling.
These slanders have been picked up by a reporter here writing for the
Sunday Telegraph in London and then by a former editor of The Times,
William Rees-Mogg. When reputable British newspapers and columnists
print this sort of thing, it is no wonder that lesser publications
wallow in sleaze.
The general was no doubt influenced by the physical dangers he might
face. Certainly his wife, Alma, thought about it. She said that she
feared there was a nut out there who might shoot her husband, as John
Hinckley shot President Reagan, or Lee Oswald shot John Kennedy.
She was asked on Wednesday whether the Rabin assassination had
influenced her, and replied: ''It's certainly something we ought to
consider; about the feeling that exists in the world against leaders and
people who are trying to accomplish something in the face of peace.''
In other words, the forces of envy and political extremism are always
out to destroy our leaders.
This is, fortunately, less the case in Britain than it is here. To put
it very charitably, the Republican candidates for the presidency, and
the present incumbent, do not inspire the sort of trust and affection
that the presidential system needs.
Since the Second World War only two Presidents have left office
peacefully with their popularity more or less intact. Truman and Johnson
were so unpopular they dared not run for re-election; Nixon was forced
to resign; Ford, Carter and Bush were defeated; and Kennedy was killed.
That leaves Eisenhower and Reagan, the only two-term Presidents.
This is not exactly new. There have not been very many successful
two-term Presidents in the past 160 years. The American system is
unforgiving, and disposes of its Presidents with callous regularity.
So do other countries, of course. Italy and Japan chew up their Prime
Ministers and spit them out with astonishing rapidity, so does Canada,
but more slowly, and the collapse of President Chirac's popularity is a
wonder to behold.
It makes the relative longevity of British Prime Ministers all the
more remarkable.
All the same, there is something special about the American
experience. The country always invests immense hopes in each new
President. Bill Clinton made it all explicit, campaigning in 1992 as
''The man from Hope'', meaning the village of that name where he was
born.
It was a new beginning, a new generation, and the parallels with the
Kennedy inauguration were not only emphasised by the Democrats, they
were really believed by the country at large, for a brief moment.
George Bush had been welcomed rather less effusively, but two years
after he reached the White House, at the conclusion of the Gulf war, his
popularity ratings were higher than those of any President on record.
Reagan came into office promising ''it's morning again in America'',
which sounded nice, even if it meant nothing very much, and he was
certainly hugely popular.
We build them up, and then we pull them down. Bush won a lower
percentage of votes than any President running for election since 1912.
Newt Gingrich is going through the same process. He offered himself as a
revolutionary, and Americans are already demanding to know why their pay
cheques are no bigger (actually, the average worker is slightly worse
off than he was a year ago).
Gingrich is blamed because he has not fulfilled all his promises and
brought prosperity and domestic peace in 12 months. He can hardly
complain, since he made the same charge against Clinton, after doing his
best to thwart everything the President tried for two years.
A more balanced political system would start with lower expectations.
If politicians were more honest about their limitations, the public
might be more forgiving.
The Republicans have been telling the country at least since Reagan's
1980 campaign that government is the problem. Everything would be fine
if only ''Washington'' vanished from the face of the earth.
They have been relentlessly attacking the government, blaming it for
everything, and the propaganda has had its effect. At the same time, as
every congressional, senate or presidential race gets nastier, more
personal, dirtier, the cumulative effect has been to reduce politicians'
status to the level of journalist or shyster lawyer.
No wonder people of the quality of Colin Powell have so little heart
for the fight. A number of prominent Democrats in Congress have
announced that they will not run for re-election next year, and the
party is having difficulty in finding respectable candidates to replace
them.
There doesn't seem to be any relief in sight. Clinton, who enrages the
far right, also dismays the liberals, who find his endless vacillations
a betrayal of all his promises. As for the Republican field, without the
general, it's a bunch of dull worthies and a couple of vicious bullies.
Lamentable prospect.

EVEN the most adventurous of investors should have a bedrock of assets
in risk-free investments which means straightforward deposits in one
form or another.
Clearly TESSAs are the first port of call because of their tax-free
status but for those who already have their fill, special offers do
arise from time to time from banks, building societies and life offices
which are particularly good value.
One such is available from today from Britannia Life, the
Glasgow-based company which is the life, investment and pensions arm of
Britannia Building Society. It is a 5[1/2]-year term guaranteed bond
paying 7% net of basic rate tax. At the end of the term the investor
will receive 145% of his original investment.
The minimum investment is #5000 and the maximum #500,000. A quarterly
income option is available, paying 1.65% every three months, equivalent
to 6.75% per annum. The limited offer will definitely close by December
16, but judging by the demand which Britannia is aware of already it may
well close before this date, though the maximum the company is prepared
to take in has yet to be fixed.
Higher rate payers will have to pay tax but at the end of the term
they can defer the liability by rolling sum on maturity into another
investment bond. Non-taxpayers will not be able to claim tax back.
The bond can be surrendered before the full term though the pro rata
return will be less.
The high return is possible because Britannia expects to take in a
substantial amount and its link with a building society is a major
advantage in maximising the return.
An alternative over four years is the ''Millenium Bond'' currently on
offer from Birmingham Midshires Building Society. This pays 7.75% gross
and so would be a better choice for non-taxpayers.
Monthly interest is available with a lower rate of 7.25%. Minimum
investment is #5000 and the bond may well also close before the official
December 30 limit. No withdrawals are allowed.
These rates are highly competitive, particularly as the next movement
in base rates is more likely to be down than up given the way the
economy is slowing.

SMALL businesses in Scotland are less concerned about environmental
issues than their counterparts in the rest of Britain, according to a
report from Imperial College, London.
A survey by Groundwork, an environmental partnership organisation,
shows that 58% of the Scottish companies questioned were concerned,
compared to a national average of 70%.
The report, Small Firms and the Environment, was based on research by
Ruth Hillary, at the college's Centre for Environmental Technology, and
included a Gallup survey of 300 small to medium-sized enterprises in the
UK -- 50% of them manufacturing and construction businesses, the rest
from the service sector.
It showed that only 15% of Scottish companies felt they made a ''quite
high'' or ''very high'' impact on the local environment.
Across Britain, however, most small businesses are unaware of their
impact on the environment and see few reasons to improve their
performance. And although 70% of small firms are concerned about the
environment, they are largely failing to respond.
The key findings show that small businesses are :
* Unaware of legislation -- 84% did not know of the 1991 Duty of Care
Requirements;
* Unconvinced of the potential savings and market opportunities; 24%
saw no benefit from environmental actions;
Bill Anderson, Scottish Secretary of the Federation of Small
Businesses, interpreted the fact that 15% of Scottish small business
felt they had a ''quite high'' or ''very high'' impact on the
environment as a sign of their awareness.
''The small business sector in Scotland is found far more in rural
areas,where a little bit of pollution goes a long way.''said Mr
Anderson.

GLASGOW, the sleeping giants of Scottish rugby, have set their sights
on conquering Europe, thanks to a #20,000 cash injection. City officials
yesterday unveiled a sponsorship package which they will plough into
preparation for the new age of continental competition.
Apart from having the financial security, they have already earmarked
the rest of the season as a dress rehearsal for the European Cup, which
Scotland's districts are set to play in next term.
In addition to facing South African side Griqualand West on Monday,
they have fixed up meetings with English champions Leicester, top New
Zealand province Canterbury, and Irish sides Ulster and Connaught. The
real continental touch will come in early summer when they visit Italy
to take on Turin and Milan.
Manager and chief selector Hamish Fyfe said: ''It looks pretty certain
that Scotland will be represented in Europe by the districts. We aim to
be ready for the challenge.''
The deal announced at Hughenden yesterday includes new backing from
law firm Dundas &amp; Wilson, along with contributions from members of
Glasgow's Business Patrons Association, including Marks &amp; Spencer,
Scottish Power, Slater Hogg and Howison, Rank Xerox, and InterCity East
Coast. There has also been pledged continued support by City of Glasgow
District, who are about to start work on converting Scotstoun Showground
into a rugby centre of excellence.
* GLASGOW, beaten 8-7 by South last month, have made three changes for
the Bank of Scotland schools district championship match against North
at New Anniesland on Monday (kick-off 2.30pm). Alan Jackson's
introduction on the right wing increases St Aloysius' complement to
four. Andrew Lees (Cumnock) and Iain Daly (Glasgow Academy) join the
pack. Team:
P Cumming (Kelvinside); A Jackson, M Loakman (both St Aloysius'), A
Gibbon (Hutchesons'), F McQuarrie; C Hodgkinson (both Glasgow HS), G
Clarke (Glasgow Academy); C di Ciacca (St Aloysius'), A Lawson (Eastwood
HS), A Lamont (St Aloysius'), I Daly (Glasgow Academy), T Boyd
(Hutchesons'), M Facenna (Glasgow HS), A Lees (Cumnock Academy), G
Howieson (Hutchesons'), captain. Replacements -- S Agnew (Glasgow HS), S
Gemmell (St Columba's), A Louden (Belmont Academy), C Sheridan (St
Aloysius'), S Byron (Glasgow HS), M McColl, D Borthwick (both
Kelvinside).

MIDLANDS Schools' game against Lothian at Goldenacre in the Bank of
Scotland schools under-18 inter district championship last week provided
an interesting comparison in the make-up of the teams.
Whereas Lothians drew from only three schools -- Heriot's, Watson's
and Stewart's-Melville -- Midlands cast the net wider, albeit that five
of the backs were provided by Dollar Academy. In all, seven schools were
represented in the winning Midlands team including, for the first time
in many years, Waid Academy in the East Neuk town of Anstruther.
Douglas Arneil, a technical administrator with the Scottish Rugby
Union whose brief is schools and youth development, said: ''In almost
every school there is a good player. It is important that the system
catches these players for the reason that they are good players and not
because of where they come from. It is important that they get the
chance to play at a higher level.''
Arneil believes that Midlands are particularly fortunate in having
youth development officers in Dunfermline, where Rowen Shepherd is
becoming an ever more influential figure, Kirkcaldy (Alec Carruthers)
and Perth (Ian Robertson).

ENGLAND captain Will Carling yesterday welcomed a huge new cash deal
which gives the international squad access to ''several millions'' over
four years.
Mobile phone firm Cellnet have become the ''elite sponsors'' of
England and will be handing over a ''six-figure sum each year'',
according to the company's managing director Howard Ford.
Cellnet have not revealed their exact contribution, although the
option of a fifth year should take the cash available for top players
and the grass roots game to #4m. But Cellnet's logo will not appear on
the England shirt -- only the training kit.
''It is great for the squad to have an elite sponsor. We have been
negotiating and there is general satisfaction in the squad,'' said
Carling. ''Everything is so new in the northern hemisphere that it is
still hard to know what the figures will be, but this is a good start.''
Cellnet were one of England's joint sponsors before becoming the sole
underwriters of the World Cup squad.
England's regular players will receive #15,000-plus and also will be
given a bonus from the Rugby Football Union for match appearances. ''I
think that more players will give up their jobs, even though I advised
them earlier in the season to stick with the day job,'' added Carling.
''The Rugby Union are unhappy about this because of the long-term
possible detriment to a career. But the players feel that if we are to
compete against the southern hemisphere, who are professionals, we need
to train and prepare without a full-time job. It is a personal choice.''
RFU treasurer David Robinson said that the decision not to have a logo
on the match shirt was decided last season, and Cellnet were quite happy
to restrict their player advertising to the training ground.
''We recently had a redesigned shirt and replicas were sold to the
public,'' said Robinson. ''In order not take advantage of the youngsters
we wanted to retain the same jersey design, but in the new open game
that could change, and Cellnet would have an option.
''Any move to put a logo on the match shirt would involve a new figure
being put on our deal.''
Ford emphasised that his mobile phone company wanted to support the
game at every level. ''We are more interested in spreading our exposure
rather than putting all our eggs in one basket. We will get exposure at
grass roots level,'' he said. ''Five years ago the average age of a
mobile phone buyer was 46. Now it is 23, so it is in our interests to
spread our money around the younger age groups. The emphasis was on the
training kit. The international shirt is like the crown jewels.''
RFU secretary Tony Hallett said: ''The sanctity of the England shirt
and the Rose emblem is part of England's policy, and it suited both of
us to omit it from any deal or jersey.''
England's agents are still negotiating with their previous sponsors
and Courage, who underwrite the leagues, will still be involved in
England players promoting the game.
England A players will also receive some of the vast amounts of cash
that are flowing into Twickenham.

David Ross reports that as Highland region fights a losing battle to
provide proper school accommodation, clusters of cabins are springing up
in playgrounds throughout the area
LAST WEEK more than 300 parents from the Black Isle packed into the
area's sole secondary school, Fortrose Academy, as part of the campaign
to persuade the authorities that a new extension for the school is a
priority.
They heard the facts of school life from rector Douglas Simpson: the
school's ''new building'' was constructed 25 years ago to cope with a
projected school role of 400; at the beginning of this session 681
pupils were enrolled, a 70% increase; one third of classrooms are in
temporary accommodation; the canteen can seat 60 yet 400 pupils take
lunch each day; the library can only accommodate half a class at a time.
The litany of problems continued.
The Fortrose cause received some publicity, not least because of
asbestos in the main building, which is safe as long as it isn't
disturbed. Sometime it will have to be, for rewiring. But the Black Isle
parents' concerns over accommodation are mirrored throughout the
Highlands, where the ''demountable'' cabin has almost become part of a
child's life in places like Ullapool where there are 20 temporary
classrooms, and in Portree there are 16.
Ullapool, Portree, Lochaber, Glen Urquhart high schools are all
clamouring for new schools, extensions or renovations. There is a new
school planned for Ardnamurchan; Culloden Academy looks as though it
will need an extension; and there are improvements needed at Inverness
Royal Academy and Millburn.
These are just the secondary schools which have been classified as A
or B priorities in Highland Regional Council's building programme. If
they were all tackled, it would cost the council about #34m, without
doing anything to ease the position in primaries, but in this current
year Highland will only be allowed allowed to spend #3.2m. Fortrose and
Ullapool are neck and neck at the top of the list this year, but work
couldn't begin on either because of lack of money.
The position is difficult throughout the rest of Scotland, but there
they face different problems; old inner-city schools having to close and
amalgamate as falling rolls make educational provision ever more
complicated.
Jim Stevenson, Highland's depute director of education, explains that
one of the problems in the Highlands is that school rolls are actually
increasing in some areas.
''We have real increases in school rolls in places like Skye, and
Ullapool. But also in the West we have the problem of parents no longer
being willing to accept their children staying away from home in hostel
acommodation in the east. So we have to provide for them, and what do
you do if you have no accommodation? You add temporary classrooms, often
on to an old junior secondary school that was probably built in the
1870s. This is the situation in Ullapool, where you could say most of
the education is actually done in temporary classrooms.
In addition, because of the geographical spread of our provision it
would be extremely difficult to embark on a programme of
rationalisation. Where it might be possible -- around the Moray Firth,
Inverness, Dingwall, Easter Ross, Nairn -- we have had large increases
in pupils staying on in school after leaving age, as we have had
elsewhere. I think it is largely because of poor employment prospects,
but it puts pressure on accommodation. We have also had to adapt to
cater for the changes in the curriculum and the rise of such subjects as
computer and technological studies.''
The Highland problem has also been rounded off by the number of
schools such as Portree, Lochaber, Fortrose, which were built in the
late 1960s with a flat roof, just about the least suitable design for
the Highland climate.
Obviously the solution to the Highland school building problem, as it
is in the rest of Scotland, is money. But unlike other local authority
difficulties they don't want more money from the Scottish Office, only
permission to borrow more themselves.
The convener of Highland Regional Council's finance committee is
Lochbroom councillor David Green. ''The position with our schools is
getting worse. Everywhere you go there is a campaign being launched by
parents. We were allowed to borrow #3.225m to spend on our schools this
year. The figure for the whole of Scotland, I think, is just #70m. We
could spend all that in Highland region and still have problems.
''Some say we should use the #13m that we spend on roads and
transport; transfer it for one year to deal with school building. That
would never be on because of the enormous problems we have with the
Highland road network, but if we did that the Scottish Office would very
quickly say we didn't need that level of borrowing on that budget and
trim it accordingly.
''The only way we can make any real progress is to win an increase to
our capital borrowing consents. At present the council services a
capital loan debt of #300m. If we were to increase our education
borrowing by #10m for school building in one year it wouldn't mean huge
increases in council tax bills at all, because of how the repayments are
structured.
''In addition, there could be very real revenue savings from the huge
costs of maintaining old school buildings or heating temporary
classrooms where the heat loss is enormous.''
Mr Green said that the danger now was that far from getting increased
capital consent, there could be a reduction as the Government appeared
determined to squeeze every corner of public life in order to pay for
pre-election tax cuts.
''You just wonder about their priorities. Just #70m for all Scotland's
school buildings, yet they will think nothing of #600m for a five-mile
stretch of motorway near Carlisle or somewhere.''
The ''demountable'' could be part of Highland life for a while yet.

BRITISH Telecom has seen the number of domestic phones connected to
its network fall for the first time since privatisation as cable
television companies tempt people away from the group.
The drop is a tiny 0.2% but is indicative of the greater competitive
pressure facing the market leader. Call charges have also come down
further in the past year under the price formula set by the regulator
Oftel. So second-quarter profits dipped 7% to #732m excluding
exceptionals, though at the operating level they still represented #102
per second. For the six months to September pre-tax profits were still
ahead.
The interim dividend is raised by 5.7% to 7.45p.
Turnover from inland calls in the second quarter was down 6.5% at
#1181m, though international calls were 3.1% up at #496m. The number of
business lines installed rose by 5%. Rentals were 7% up at #671m.
Cellnet mobile business continues its heady expansion, with turnover
rising 42% to #220m.
Chairman Sir Iain Vallance commented: ''Further progress has been made
in the half-year in developing new services and markets and in winning
contracts with major customers. These advances position BT well for the
future, although our progress is being inhibited by the harsh regulatory
regime in the UK.''
BT is compelled to reduce its prices by about 3[1/2]% a year at the
present inflation rate. Sir Iain remarked that customers had seen
reductions of over a third in the cost of national calls and over a
fifth in local ones in real terms in the past two years.
The Consumer Association criticised BT yesterday, with senior
researcher Colin Meek declaring: ''BT has consistently targeted its
price reductions where it faces most competition -- at business
customers.
''BT's monopoly of residential customers has only been dented. It
still commands over 90% of domestic business, and intense competition
for some large business users should not camouflage this.''
Pricing per second was introduced in June, when prices were cut by 3%.
Mr Meek pointed out that other companies charged substantially less than
BT.
However, Sir Iain said average call charges had fallen by 19% for
businesses and 16% for residential customers since November 1993, making
its charges ''among the lowest in the world''.
The group intends to extend an advertising campaign in Scotland,
highlighting the lower prices to the rest of the country. The campaign
complements the present ''It's good to talk'' advertising theme.
Cost-cutting has offset the steady reduction in prices, though
redundancy charges in the six months to Septmber were down from #151m to
#123m. The full year is expected to see 8000 jobs axed, with a further
7000 to go in 1996/97.
The Communications Workers Union said BT should stop its programme of
staff reductions because of developments on the information
superhighway.
''Now that BT is destined to play a major role in establishing the
UK's superhighway, it is illogical to get rid of the very people who
have the expertise to install it,'' said joint secretary Tony Young.
This refers to Labour's plan to give BT a licence to broadcast
entertainment through its network if it establishes an information
''superhighway''.
The latest results were in line with outside forecasts and BT shares
gained 7[1/2]p to 371[1/2]p. NatWest Securities analyst Mark Lambert
commented: ''The pressures that exist in the business are very evident
in these figures and areas of growth such as mobile services are strong
but not strong enough to drive the group forward.''

BETT Brothers, the Dundee-based builder, pub owner and property group
has suffered a fall in pre-tax profits due to setbacks in the volatile
area of investment property, writes KRISTY DORSEY.
Pre-tax profits fell to #5.57m from #5.93m during the year to August
31, but a good performance by the housebuilding and inns divisions
helped the group's shares add 1p to 167p.
Profits in the house-building division rose 12% to #3.7m, while
profits from the inns business increased 8% to #1.1m. Turnover was up
11% at #33.5m.
Bett Brothers chief executive Ronnie Hanna said, although overall
profits were slightly reduced, it was important to note that the losses
came in an area which was irregular and dependent on timing.
The 12-month profits from investment property, he added, were not a
complete measure of the performance of the division.
''What you have to look at is each individual area,'' he said. ''Two
businesses (home-building and inns) have done very well. Property is
very difficult right now and has a very lumpy pattern.''
In spite of a 47% increase in borrowings to #7.71m, Mr Hanna believed
Bett Brothers' gearing level of 35% was strong.
After a final dividend of 3.65p, Bett Brothers total payout was up 20%
at 5.4p. Headline earnings per share were 28.83p, down from 32.56p, but
Mr Hanna blamed this on the ''irregular profit pattern'' in property and
an increase in the effective rate of tax from 18% to 22%.
Analyst Graham Allan, at the Edinburgh offices of stockbroker Tilney,
said the company looked promising enough, although some areas of the
business warranted closer examination.
''The house-building side seemed satisfactory,'' he said, ''but there
must be something in the timing of the contracts they've entered into
that we haven't seen yet.
''We need to see those numbers, but on the face of it, it looks
good.''
All three Bett Brothers' divisions are operating in tough markets but
the company is ''cautiously optimistic'' about its future.
Mr Hanna pointed out that despite a difficult housing market, Bett
Brothers had managed to finish 24 more houses over the past year,
bringing the total to to 250.
In the inns division, Mr Hanna said the company intended to continue
focusing on food and a ''family atmosphere'', although competition in
this market had frustrated some of Bett Brothers' efforts.
''We expect to see steady growth there,'' Mr Hanna added, ''and we've
got some projects in the pipeline, but there are a lot of people chasing
the same deals.''
Bett Brothers' cash holdings dropped dramatically from #3.50m to
#843,000 as funds were poured into new investments.
The company said consumer confidence remained fragile and this was
continuing to hamper trading in the current financial year.

The #1.8bn train fleet sell-off is the latest disposal in the
accelerating BR privatisation process. Iain Wilson examines the disquiet
over secrecy surrounding the deals.
SLOWLY but surely British Rail has been selling off valuable assets to
the private sector -- at undisclosed prices -- with surprisingly little
political or public comment.
So far, all eyes on the privatisation programme have focused on the
impending sale of the first three train-operating franchises, and
Government efforts to dispose of Railtrack, responsible for
infrastructure, including stations and track.
But even before yesterday's rolling stock sell-off 18 businesses had
gone -- almost 20% of the principal operating companies or units listed
for disposal under the break-up of BR.
Some have been sold reputedly for a fraction of their true or
potential worth. Red Star Parcels, albeit loss-making, is said to have
changed hands for #1.
The new owners of formerly public assets include foreign interests,
management buy-out teams, and the likes of British Steel and the Phoenix
Timber Group.
Another 43 subsidiary companies or divisions have been advertised or
offered for sale. The remaining 36 on the principal list, likely to
expand as more businesses are established, are said to be ''preparing
for privatisation''.
These include ScotRail and InterCity West Coast, whose drives towards
the private sector have been dogged by chaos, confusion, and
politicking.
Despite perceptions that the programme remains a shambles, it is clear
that significant momentum has been built up this year.
The first loss to the public sector in 1994 was a quarry, Meldon, sold
to ECC Construction Materials Ltd.
But since April this year, 17 other businesses have gone -- usually
with no prices announced because the Government claims that would impact
on those yet to be disposed of. There have been three Scottish sales,
excluding Red Star interests:
* The maintenance workshops at Springburn, Glasgow, where more than
200 are employed -- bought by Railcare, a new company formed by
engineering giants Babcock International and German electronics group
Siemens.
* The Infrastructure Design Group, in Glasgow, involving about 60
staff, now under the wing of Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick, an international
firm of consulting engineers, transport planners and environmental

The Labour Party is gearing up for renewed protests over secrecy
surrounding the sale prices. It believes national assets are being lost
for a tiny proportion of their true value.
Red Star, a so-called non-core business which made an operating loss
of #7.5m last year on a turnover of #25m, is alleged to have attracted
an offer of #2m. But it was sold on September 5 -- for a reputed, token
#1 -- to a management buy-out team.
The deal will leave BR with a redundancy bill of up to #7m for an
estimated 600 people who will lose their jobs.
The first train-operating franchises -- Great Western Railways
(between London-Bristol-Wales); South West Trains
(Exeter-Southampton-London), and the London-Tilbury-Southend line -- are
expected to be awarded by the end of the year.
Bidders include BR management buy-out teams, shipping company Sea
Containers, and it is understood Perth-based bus giant Stagecoach is
shortlisted for all three franchises.
Stagecoach also looks set to bid for InterCity East Coast, Midland
Main Lines, and Gatwick Express, which have been named in the second
tranche for sale.
Such high-profile disposals are crucial to the Government's
privatisation programme, which aims to have sold 51% of UK passenger
services by April. They are also a matter for concern to the Opposition,
pledged to retake control of the railways if victorious at the next
General Election.
Such a task would be harder, and costlier, if many more parts are sold
off in the intervening period. It could be a close-run thing.
Of the four train operators running in Scotland, InterCity East Coast
appears the most likely to be in private hands this side of a General
Election, due by May, 1997.
Railtrack's flotation is due next April or May, but city estimates of
the company's value, once as high as #4bn, have since more than halved.

It's all change (subtly) for British beauties that cost up to
#215,000, says Ross Finlay
THE world's most prestigious car company is usually referred to as
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, but since 1931 it has also included Bentley
Motors Ltd. Bentley offers six catalogued models to Rolls-Royce's three,
and has been re-established as a sporting, high-performance luxury
marque.
The 1996 model-year cars feature all the recent improvements to
performance, economy and emission levels, as well as brand-new body and
interior modifications.
Some of the exterior changes are subtle ones to create the optical
illusion that the cars are lower. The grilles are smaller, and the
Rolls-Royce Flying Lady mascot has been reduced in size to suit.
Bentleys have their own very effective grille design, with the vertical
units now in acid-etched stainless steel.
Bentley prices range from #99,980 for the ''entry level'' Brooklands
to the #215,000 confidently asked for the magnificent Azure Convertible.
But through their Mulliner Park Ward coachbuilding division, both
Rolls-Royce and Bentley can provide almost bespoke car-building in the
old style, down to a special edition of one.
The Turbo R on show at the SECC costs #137,755, although there is an
extra charge of almost #13,000 for the long wheelbase version with as
much rear passenger legroom as you would expect in the first place.
Interior appointments, leather and woodwork are as lavish as ever. The
1996 fascia is revised, although the shallowness of the windscreen is
shown by the fact that the driver's-side wiper still needs to be mounted
on a pantagraph arm.
On the open road, the Turbo R does not feel particularly bulky,
although measured across the wing mirrors it is almost seven feet wide.
Despite having more sporting suspension settings than a Rolls-Royce,
this very heavy saloon can hardly be expected to be as agile on corners
as some hatchback GTi. The colossal straight-line performance, born of a
0-60mph time under six seconds and massive mid-range torque, means that
it has no need to be.
Normal considerations of value for money and fuel economy around 16mpg
hardly come into it. Flattered and cossetted by just driving one,
Bentley owners live in a world of their own.
Contrary to expectations, cars like the Turbo R do not seem extreme or
exotic from behind the wheel. They are expensive, powerful, mechanically
complex and beautifully built, but they are also naturally well
mannered. However, a clumsily driven Bentley will betray its driver's
gaucheness at the controls.
There are unexpected homely touches. The Turbo R I was driving creaked
as one item of leather roof lining graunched against another. It turns
out that there is a quick and easy cure.  Ah, said the Rolls-Royce man
-- Vaseline!

That other motor show: Ross Finlay looks at
the hall that keeps all our automotive yesterdays.
WHILE the SECC is the place to see the latest cars, at least for the
duration of the Scottish Motor Show, Glasgow's Kelvin Hall is where
their predecessors are on display.
In the same location where the motor show was held until 1983, the
Museum of Transport includes not only buses, trams, horse-drawn
carriages, trains and rolling stock, as well as what is probably the
world's finest collection of ship models, but also cars and commercial
vehicles going back to the 1890s.
Many of the makes mentioned elsewhere in this motoring section are
represented. Sir William Burrell's Phantom II Rolls-Royce, a beautiful
Bentley Sedanca Coupe, an Aston Martin DB6 and a Lagonda Tourer are just
some of the exhibits.
In fairly cramped conditions there is a remarkable spread of
Scottish-built cars, from Argylls, Albions and Arrol-Johnstons of the
pioneering days, to a Hillman Imp and Avenger from the false dawn of
Linwood.
Some lesser-known makes recall the geographical extent of the old
Scottish motor industry. The Galloway was built at Tongland and later at
Heathhall, base of the Arrol-Johnston company which creaked to a halt
with the Anglo-Scottish Arrol-Aster.
The Beardmore car came from Anniesland, while the Beardmore taxi was
built both at Anniesland and in Paisley, with a test route up the
Fereneze Hills. Before Linwood opened, it was this taxi design which
held the Scottish production record for numbers built, well ahead of any
of the private cars.
Look at the replica of Karl Benz's original car of 1885, then at the
1898 Benz Comfortable which was owned by the famous Glasgow outfitter
George Paisley. It is clear why Benz was criticised for his stone-wall
refusal to keep up with the times.
An imposing 1919 Stanley Steamer is an example of how American
manufacturers like Stanley and Doble persevered with steam power long
after Europe had decided petrol engines were the way to go.
Two inventive Scottish engineers are represented. The innovative
Anderson Special, built in Newton Mearns, is fitted with an
eight-cylinder engine formed from two four-cylinder Humber blocks. The
museum catalogue describes it as having been built f or hill-climb
races, a form of motorsport which has never actually existed.
In fact, it was a trials car, designed for storming up steep and
slippery hills. The photograph alongside does not show it at its best.
Taken during a 1936 event, it pictures the Anderson Special having
failed on a hill and about to be hauled to the top by a tractor.
Another exhibit is the Robertson V4 two-stroke engine designed by
James Robertson of Drymen. This is all that remains of the Cowal sports
car, road tested in The Glasgow Herald in 1934.
The car was built primarily to accommodate the engine, in which Robert
son tried to interest mainstream manufacturers. But none took it on, and
he dismantled the Cowal, leaving only the engine to be presented to the
museum.

Peter Phillips will know today if he has been picked for the Scottish
schools' rugby squad. William Russell reports on a royal in touch with
reality
AT LAST, an uncomplicated royal! Or that would be the case, were it
not that Peter Phillips is not strictly speaking royal, but a commoner,
the first commoner grandchild of a sovereign for 500 years.
The Queen's 17-year-old, rugby-playing grandson, who learns today
whether he has gained a place in the 22-strong Scottish schools squad,
was until yesterday one of the lesser-known members of the clan. His
appearance at the Murrayfield trials for the Scottish team, where he
scored an impressive try for his side, changed that.
How has he got this far without suffering the public exposure his
royal cousins have had to face? One reason is that the Princess Royal,
knowing full well the horrors of a royal childhood, was determined when
she married Captain Mark Phillips that their family should be brought up
with as little pomp and fuss as possible.
She resisted titles for her husband or their children, ensured their
commoner status, and defied convention by naming their son after his
paternal grandfather, not another member of the family Firm, and opting
for the unprecedented name of Zara for her daughter.
She ensured Peter's education -- he is currently at Gordonstoun -- was
conducted without frills or fuss. No boy with the Queen for grandmother
can be just another boy-next-door and it would be daft to suggest
otherwise, but Master Peter, as he was known at Gatcombe Park, was given
the same sort of upbringing as any other child in the well-heeled horsey
English county set which is his parents' natural milieu. It may be
privileged, but it is a world in touch with reality.
The Phillips children were brought up to do things for themselves, not
rely on a servant to run their bath or help them on with their clothes.
They made their own beds, tidied their rooms, and cared for their pets
like their less well-connected friends had to do.
Nor was their education provided by a governess or tutor. Peter was
sent first to a playschool in nearby Minchinhampton, then to the local
primary school, after which he disappeared into the anonymity of his
prep school, Port Regis in Dorset, where he captained the rugby team and
played hockey. Gordonstoun, the Morayshire home for outdoor hearties
proved a natural choice for an athletically talented boy, the sort of
teenager least likely to be found talking to plants.
He had other advantages. Knowing William and Harry could open doors in
later life. Peter Philips must make his own way in the world. Friendship
with him will not be a social open sesame, so he makes his friends on
his own recognisances.
Ninth in the line of succession, he is an ordinary, sports-mad
teenager, described as bright, gregarious and popular, among whose most
prized possessions is the shirt worn by Scotland captain David Sole
during the Grand Slam victory over England in 1990.
He is eligible to play for Scotland because his time at Gordonstoun
meets the required residence qualification. This is just as well because
he does not possess the necessary Scottish ancestry. His maternal
grandmother, as remote as the link can be, is not a Scot. Nor, contrary
to general belief, is his great grandmother, the Queen Mother. Happily
accepted as One of Us, Elizabeth Bowes Lyon although of Scots parentage,
was not born at Glamis but at the Strathmore family home in
Hertfordshire.
Given the Windsors' proven lack of talent through the generations for
rearing their offspring, how did Princess Anne, who has never evinced
any great fondness for children as a species, in spite of her work for
the Save the Children Fund, get it right?
It has been more because she got her own life style right than because
she designed one specially for her children. She has always drawn a firm
line between her public and private selves, refusing to be deflected by
such trivial things as personal popularity. ''You have to stay remote,
otherwise you'd crack up,'' she once said revealingly.
It has been by keeping their children in the wings of their own lives,
aided by the fact they were not preordained for a starring role in the
royal soap opera, that she and Captain Phillips were able to ensure they
grew up in the real world.
The status of of her children was summed up by their mother with the
memorable words -- ''They're not royal -- the Queen just happens to be
their grandmother.''

THE 1993 Geneva Motor Show saw the unveiling of the Aston Martin DB7
with which Scots designer Ian Callum (see the first page of this
section) was heavily involved. On the same day, and quite unexpectedly,
the Lagonda Vignale concept car designed by his brother Moray was also
revealed. Both cars had been commissioned independently by the same
client.
We tend to think of the DB7 company as Aston Martin, but it is
actually Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd. Separate until 1947, both firms were
bought in that year by the industrialist David Brown. They remain
together as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford.
Lagonda built some of the most distinguished British cars of the
1930s, and even the 1935 Le Mans winner. W O Bentley designed a splendid
V12 engine, but hopes of calling the car in which it was fitted the
Lagonda-Bentley were squashed by Rolls-Royce, which owned the commercial
rights to the Bentley name.
It is sometimes said that David Brown's merger of Lagonda with Aston
Martin saved the former firm. In fact, transplanting W O Bentley's
postwar Lagonda engine into Aston Martins transformed them.
Lagonda production, however, petered out in 1989. Then Moray Callum,
working at the Ghia studio in Turin -- another Ford subsidiary -- was
given the opportunity to style a brand-new Lagonda prototype. It took
the Vignale model name from Ghia's former production company.
Not much has been heard about the Vignale since 1993, but the project
is still very much alive. A second prototype has been built, with the
emphasis in the interior layout now more on the driver than on the
rear-seat passengers, who were the preoccupation of the original design.
What Aston Martin Lagonda has to do is convince Ford Motor Company
that the Vignale could be built and sold at a profit. There is no
enthusiasm within Ford for anything like a repeat of the modern Bugatti
fiasco. Work is going on to see if the Vignale can be productionised,
although Moray Callum has moved from Ghia to become design manager of a
Ford studio in Detroit.
The Vignale's Scottish connection is very appropriate. Lagonda was
founded by Wilbur Gunn, an American of Scots descent. Although he moved
to Britain to establish his  business at Staines in Middlesex, he named
it from the village where he grew up -- Lagonda, on Buck Creek near
Springfield, Ohio.

A COMBINATION of fewer markdowns and supply chain improvements helped
the Burton Group to report an impressive 140% jump in annual profits to
#98.6m. Sales, adjusted for the extra week last year, grew by 1%.
Retail profits doubled to #102.1m. Reflecting the strong performance
there is a final dividend of 1.2p making a total of 2.2p for the year, a
rise of 10%, the first increase in three years.
Trading in the second half of the year was better than the first with
the company benefiting from some early improvements in merchandising.
Once again Debenhams was the star performer although there were good
improvements in business throughout the group. Debenhams' profits rose
by #10.5m to #82m. Several new stores are due to open including sites at
Dublin and Brighton.
Evans, the womenswear range aimed at larger sizes, continued its
strong performance. Increased fashionability in the product range
boosted sales. Principles and Burton Menswear remained loss-making
although at a much lower level.
The menswear ranges are more focused on modern classics and
higher-priced formal merchandise has been introduced in some city centre
stores. Burton did much less business at reduced prices which helped to
rebuild the margins. The attractiveness of Principles has been enhanced
by the introduction of a childrenswear range last month. The initial
response is said to be encouraging.
Work is ongoing to reposition the Dorothy Perkins mid-market
womenswear business. Its trading performance improved in the second half
helped by improvements to the product range although profits declined
from #11.4m to #4.1m. Top Shop achieved a significant turnaround in
performance as a result of a change in product mix with less emphasis on
hyper trendy young fashions which alientated some of its older
customers. The division moved back into profit for the year of #8.5m
compared with a loss of #7.2m last year.
Capital expenditure was #120m in the year with 661 Multiple shops
modernised. Just over three-quarters of the Multiples shops are now
modernised in the latest formats. Despite the heavy investment
programme, the group's balance sheet is strong. Healthy operating
cashflow enabling year-end gearing to drop to just 2% from 10%.
Even taking into account the money involved in the recent decisions to
acquire the freeholds of two of its flagship stores, Debenhams and Top
Shop in London's Oxford Street, gearing would still be a comfortable
18%.
Current trading is said to be good with sales up 4.4% and margins 2.2%
ahead of last year. However, Mr Hoerner said he was ''very cautious''
about the group's prospects given the fragile state of the UK retail
market. In addition, costs are expected to increase at a slightly higher
rate than inflation in the current year, because of the group's
investment in systems and supply chain improvements.
The City was impressed with the group's trading performance and
dividend growth and the shares gained 5p to 110p where they yield 2.5%.

IT'S business as usual as far as Northumbrian Water is concerned
despite the unwelcome attention of French group Lyonnaise des Eaux,
writes NICOLA REEVES.
Interim profits were ahead of city expectations at #61.4m before tax,
an increase of 33%.
The interim dividend is raised by 17% to 11.0p. A scrip dividend
alternative is available.
The group's dividend cover could be sharply reduced in future
according to chairman Sir Frederick Holliday with benefits flowing to
shareholders in the form of dividends and to customers in the form of
reductions in their bills and/or extra investment expenditure.
Much of the strong performance came from the company's core water
supply and sewerage business, helped by a further 11% reduction in
operating costs. These were well below industry regulator Ofwat's target
of #55.9m.
The non-regulated businesses increased their profits by #600,000 to
#4.2m with turnover up 6%.
Positive cashflow, despite a strong capital programme reduced net debt
to #19m from #62.6m at the year-end.
Northumbrian is awaiting a bid from Lyonnaise following the UK
Government's decision on Wednesday to conditionally give the French firm
clearance to make a takeover bid.
As a condition, Lyonnaise will have to cut customers prices by 15%
over six years.
Additional efficiency benefits to shareholders and customers will form
part of Northumbrian's defence, if needed. Sir Frederick described the
half-year results an an ''outstanding performance'' and reiterated his
belief in ''Northumbrian's strong prospects as an independent company''
but it has agreed to meet with Lyonnaise.
With the City awaiting the bid, Northumbrian Water shares dropped 2p
to 1091p. The market is expecting any bid to be pitched at a price of
between #10 and #12 per share.
The Newcastle-based company also announced that it was injecting a
further #500,000 into what it calls a ''Kick Start'' fund devoted to the
environmental and economic regeneration of the local region.

A CALL for a radical restructuring of the Scottish seed potato
industry was made yesterday by Alistair Roy, director of Huntly-based
Gordon and Innes, one of the country's leading growers and exporters.
''What we need in Scotland is four or five very strong companies each
marketing 40,000-50,000 tonnes of seed a year. That would give us the
strength to compete with the Dutch and the Danes,'' he said.
Speaking at the Virus Tested Stem Cutting Growers' Association
conference at Aviemore, Mr Roy said the current growing base of the
industry was wrong.
Too many growers were not market-orientated. ''They grow what they
want --and not what they should be growing,'' he said.
There was a lack of trust between seed growers and merchants. Many
merchants were still operating a set-up dating back to the post-war era
-- ''working out a back shop with a telephone''.
Looking to the future, he suggested there was a need for a new body to
replace the Scottish Seed Potato Development Council. It might grow out
of the existing council, but whatever form it took it would have to be
adequately financed.
''If it doesn't have enough money, we have to find ways and means of
raising that money.'' he said.
The present council is funded by a growers' levy.
The most recent statistics did not suggest that the Scottish Seed
Potato Industry was in a healthy state, said Mr Roy. In 1980, 21,000
hectares had been grown in Scotland and that figure had now fallen to
14,000.
During the same period, Dutch growers had recorded an increase from
25,000 hectares to 37,000.
In Scotland there was a need for a more professional approach with
producers concentrating on growing and leaving marketing to specialist
groups, he suggested. ''We need a bigger variety base although we have
not marketed the varieties we do have properly.''
Mr Roy called for stricter control of the illegal smallware trade -- a
serious threat to seed growers. ''These people are total criminals and
should be subject to stricter penalties,'' he said.
''I have spent 10 years on a breeding programme and I am just getting
to the stage where I will have new varieties.
''I do not want other people saying they have the right to grow them.
I have the right to say who will grow them and how they will be
developed.''
Mr Roy's own firm of which he is marketing and development director,
currently produces 25,000 tonnes of seed a year and is a major exporter.
He hopes to double the business over the next three years.
He has identified 80 countries which import seed potatoes and this
year has spent 30 weeks abroad including visits to Indonesia, Thailand,
The Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand.
His company also grows seed in Spain and Estonia.

THIS year's Scottish National Winter Fair, to be held in the Perth
Agricultural Centre on Wednesday, November 22, is set to be the biggest
and most commercially-orientated in the 98-year history of the
organising body, the Scottish National Fatstock Club.
Speaking yesterday in Perth, Andy Hamilton, the president of the SNFC,
said: ''I believe we are set for a quite outstanding event with
increased entries in virtually every sector.
''All the trade stand space has been taken and there is already a
sense of anticipation about the Winter Fair.''
With the Smithfield Show now on a biannual basis, apart from the
livestock classes, the Winter Fair is fast assuming the role of the UK's
principal prime stock show.
This is especially true of the Scottish national premier meat
exhibition which combines live judging at the show followed by the
carcasses being judged at the Scotbeef plant at Bridge of Allan on the
following Saturday.
Entries for these classes, which are sponsored by Marks &amp; Spencer, in
the beef sector have soared to 212 with 187 sheep and 36 pigs.
Mr Hamilton said: ''Last year we were told by one of the judges from
France that it was probably the largest and best carcass show in
Europe.''
Ian Galloway, the managing director of Scotbeef, is convinced that
this aspect of the Winter Fair pays huge dividends for the Scottish
livestock industry.
He said: ''I think it lets our customers see the excellence of
Scottish meat and that is vital in these increasingly competitive
times.''
However, staging any show is an expensive business, as Mr Hamilton
freely acknowledged when he said: ''Without sponsorship and a lot of
hard work by our committee members it would be impossible.''
Mr Hamilton was particularly pleased to reveal that this year's Winter
Fair has attracted a total sponsorship package from a wide range of
sources totalling #30,000.
Meanwhile, he said it cost almost #50,000 to run the Winter Fair,
including a rental of #7000 to United Auctions for the use of their
premises.
Emphasising the growing educational role of all agricultural shows, Mr
Hamilton also announced that on the day prior to the show around 500
local schoolchildren will be conducted through the stock lines.

LEISURE AND HOTELS
LADBROKE said yesterday it had been a major loser on the National
Lottery.
It had had a far greater impact on the group's betting businesses than
had been anticipated, the company said.
The group's Vernons pools side had also suffered with a 27% fall in
turnover in the lottery's first nine months.
About 500 people have been made redundant in Vernons and Ladbroke
Racing this year because of reduced trading.
Ladbroke said the success of the lottery, in particular scratchcards,
had been exacerbated by exceptionally hot, dry weather, which had
reduced the performance of horseracing.
Profits in racing had been substantially reduced because of lower
turnover and higher operating costs due to extended evening hours and
the introduction of Sunday racing.
The bookmaking-to-hotels group warned that unless trading picked up in
the rest of this year profits would be reduced. In 1994, Ladbroke made
#128.5m before tax and the sale of the Texas DIY chain.
Ladbroke said it had put a strong case to Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to
reduce taxes on betting and football pools in the Budget and for gaming
machines to be allowed into betting shops without delay.
''This will at least allow us to compete with the lottery on more
equal terms,'' said chief executive Peter George.
While betting was in the doldrums, the Hilton International hotels
business continued to benefit from economic recovery around the world
with profits ahead of last year, said the group.

INVESTMENT TRUST
EDINBURGH Inca Trust, which invests in Latin American equities, was
knocked flat by the Mexican peso crisis in the year to September 30.
Net asset value slumped by by 43.3% after a run on the Mexican
currency last December sent stock markets crashing throughout the
region.
The trust fared much worse than its benchmark, the IFC Latin American
Investible (Total Return) Index which fell only 35.1% in sterling terms.
This was because of its statutory obligation to invest 25% of its
funds in smaller Latin American companies with a market capitalisation
of less than $500m. These were worse hit by the share crash than larger
firms.
The trust, launched by Edinburgh Fund Managers in April 1994, saw the
value of its investment portfolio slump to #25.8m from #45.6m during the
financial year just ended.
The only Latin American stock markets to fully recover from the
Mexican crisis by the end of September were Chile and Peru, but trust
chairman Donald MacDonald said he was optimistic that economic reforms
under way in Brazil would help the entire region to recover.
The trust has, therefore, boosted the weighting of Brazil in its
portfolio to 39% from 35% a year ago, while cutting back Mexico to 30%
from 43%.
Mr MacDonald warned that the immediate future for investment in Latin
America remains uncertain. ''The stockmarkets continue to trade on
historically low volumes and consequently volatility will remain an
influence in the short term,'' he said.
But Mr MacDonald was optimistic about the long-term outlook. He noted
that protected Latin American markets had opened up, inflation was under
control, economic growth remained strong and democracy was taking a
firmer hold.
Edinburgh Inca Trust, which aims for long-term capital growth, will
not pay any dividend for the year just ended, despite paying an
exceptional dividend of 0.04p in 1994 after a good performance before
the Mexican crash.

<FLAG>BUDGET COUNTDOWN</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>975454457</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Today, The Herald begins a series of occasional pre-budget articles
written by leading Scottish figures from commerce and industry. The
first of these is by David Smith, director and chief executive of the
Dunfermline Building Society.
THE Chancellor's first imperative is to do nothing which will tend to
suggest to the City or to international investors that the Government's
policy on maintaining a low-inflation, low-interest rate regime is under
threat.
If that is an economic imperative, his political imperative, with time
running out before the next election, is to do exactly the opposite, by
tax giveaways, anything which will help to re-create the ''feel-good''
factor.
Plainly for him, this will be one of the trickiest budgets ever, when
he knows he has to maintain the primary objective economically, but at
the same time must insert just enough encouragement for the voters to
help improve his party's fortunes.
That would suggest to me that he should leave the current rates of
income and corporation taxes undisturbed, but that he ought to restate
the Government's policy on resuming income tax cuts, in particular, when
he is finally convinced that inflation is well and truly out of the
system.
His main problem, particularly in the Tory heartlands of the south, is
the depressed housing market there, and to a lesser extent elsewhere in
the UK. Morale among prospective house-buyers has never been lower, and
there is great pressure for something to be done. What that something
might be is the real nub of this particular issue, with hardliners
arguing that he must do nothing, since there is no substantial evidence
that quick fixes ever produce long-term solutions. I have some sympathy
with that view.
Nevertheless, there are two measures which could be undertaken, which
might have a beneficial effect, both short term and long term.
Firstly, he could abolish stamp duty on property transactions. Given
the Government's desire to encourage home ownership, taxing housing
transactions is anachronistic, and cannot be supported. It has long been
suggested that its retention is because it is an exceptionally easy tax
to collect, and produces a useful #600m annually.
Its abolition, and not merely suspension, as was done two years ago,
would give some encouragement to those contemplating house purchases,
especially when profits on house transactions are no longer what they
were, and fees and charges therefore bear more heavily.
There is a more fundamental change which could be initiated, and that
relates to mortgage interest tax relief. At 15% relief on the first
#30,000, this tax is already withering on the vine, although available
to all house-buyers, and its value to all except the first-time buyer is
relatively insignificant.
For first-time buyers, however, any concession helps, and I would
suggest that it would be very effective to announce a withdrawal, in
phases, of relief for all but first-time buyers, and to concentrate
thereafter a maximum amount of relief on first-time buyers.
This would entail a substantial fiscal benefit on a one-time basis
only to the section of the house-buying public who not only need it, but
whose presence or otherwise makes or breaks the housing market. Unless
there are first-time buyers, markets inevitably stagnate. I would argue
that the announcement of such a measure, with details of its
implementation over a period of time, would be both welcome and fiscally
neutral.
On the savings side, it is quite beyond me why PEPS and TESSAs are
treated differently. The first is aimed at those who are prepared or can
afford to take some risk with their capital. The annual investment
entitlement is up to #9000 and the proceeds are totally tax exempt.
With a TESSA, which is a five-year savings contract, where the capital
is secure, invested generally in banks or building societies, the
maximum which can be accumulated is #9000 over that five years, for
re-investment into a new TESSA. None of the tax-exempt interest arising
during that period can be rolled over into a new tax-exempt status.
Why should there not be complete equality of treatment for investors
who do not wish to put their capital at risk, and who arguably, will
dominate among the small savers in the UK? An announcement about that
would be very welcome.
The last item relates to capital gains and inheritance taxes. Assets
held for more than three years should be exempt from capital gains,
regardless of amount, and inheritance tax should be abolished. The
latter especially is an iniquitous tax, since it will relate in normal
situations to assets which have been accumulated out of already taxed
income or capital.
People should be encouraged to save and to hand over to their families
on death, safe in the knowledge that the state will not be in there for
yet another share of hard-won wealth.
Because of cost it may be that these last two proposals could not be
implemented immediately. However, continuing to rigorously control and
reduce public expenditure would enable them to be looked at in the
future, and an announcement to that effect would be both popular,
necessary, and not damaging to the low-inflation objective.

AUTOMOBILES
Stuttgart (Germany), Thursday -- Legendary German sports carmaker
Porsche tody said it had edged back into profit for the first time in
three years.
Porsche, once a symbol of German dominance in luxury sports cars, said
group sales during the 1994/95 business year that ended on July 31
increased 11.6% to DM2600m.
The figures were the latest evidence that Porche's financial recovery,
masterminded by chairman Wendeln Wiedeking, was on track.
The company stood on the brink of collapse earlier this decade
following a plunge in the US sports car market in the late 1980s. It has
since made great strides to reduce costs.
Despite the better results, however, the company said it would not pay
a dividend for the third year running.
Porsche has suffered because the yuppie lifestyle image it epitomised
in the 1980s has fallen from favour and its cars have been criticised
for not providing good value for money.
Mr Wiedeking, who was brought in to rescue the carmarker, has said the
company would report a small profit again in the current year before
returning to solid profitability in 1996/97.
Analyst Edmund Chew of Auto Business in London said Porsche was among
the first of Germany's carmakers to slash costs and that is making its
cars competitive again.
''They have gone a long way toward getting costs down,'' he said. ''I
bet they will succeed.''
Porsche has also benefited from a growing market for luxury sports
cars and the troubles faced by Japanese competitors.
Porsche's recovery has been largely based on the success of its new
911 Carrera model launched last year to solid reviews from car critics.
In the future, Porsche will concentrate on a simpler, two-model line
of the new 996 and a new, lower-priced Boxster. It recently phased out
production of its 928 and 968 models.
Porsche has said it expects production and sales to surge from the
1996/97 business year when the Boxster is introduced. It aims to make
30,000 cars a year from the next business year compared to about 20,000
in 1994/95. -- Reuter

BANKING
ROYAL Bank of Scotland is building a #3.5m cash and cheque processing
centre at Salford, Greater Manchester, which it will share with Abbey
National.
The new building will be surrounded by tight security and will act as
a centre for distributing cash to banks branches and corporate clients
in the north of England.
It is due to open in the Spring of 1996 and will initially employ
about 55 Royal Bank staff, most of whom are transferring from smaller
premises in Manchester.
Abbey National will employ about 25 newly recruited staff at the
centre.
The two banks will operate separately inside the building, which is
owned by Royal Bank, but they will share its security system, conference
room and staff accommodation.
Royal Bank will use the centre to distribute cash on behalf of large
companies and building societies as well as its own branches. Abbey
National will use it to handle cash, cheques and travellers cheques for
its own branch network.

AMERICAN ECONOMY
Washington, Thursday -- Wholesale prices fell unexpectedly in October,
the Government said today, as food prices were steady, gasoline prices
slid and heating oil prices took their steepest plunge in almost four
years.
The Labour Department said its Producer Price Index fell 0.1% last
month after a 0.3% increase in September. It was the third drop in five
months and provided fresh evidence that inflation remains in check in
the final months of 1995.
Prices of a variety of goods fell, including tobacco, fish and
poultry. Vegetable prices showed the largest drop since January. Prices
of ''intermediate'' goods that require further processing -- such as
flour and synthetic fibers -- posted their largest drop in nearly two
years.
Prices of raw materials rose, but at a slower pace. Car prices also
increased.
After factoring out food and energy costs, which can fluctuate widely
month to month, the closely watched ''core'' PPI was steady last month
after rising 0.2%.
Economists had expected the PPI to be unchanged in November and the
core rate to fall 0.1%.
The report should give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest
rates another notch to shore up economic growth after cutting short-term
rates a quarter point in July.
The Fed's policy arm meets on Wednesday, although economists expect
the central bank will keep rates steady pending the outcome of budget
talks in Washington.
But economists expect the Fed will cut rates later this year, given
signs the economy is losing steam after racing ahead at a 4.2% annual
rate in the third quarter.
The PPI showed that energy prices tumbled 0.9% last month after
sliding 0.5% in September. Petrol prices fell 2.7% and heating oil
prices plunged 11.1%, the steepest fall since a 12.1% drop in January
1992.
Food prices were steady after rising 1.0%. Beef and veal prices rose
3.3%, but poultry prices slipped 1.4% and vegetable prices tumbled
19.1%. -- Reuter

A COUPLE of decades ago when I was writing for that blatt across the
other side of the country I was once described by a reader. She said I
looked horribly like the then Burt Reynolds. Well I did. I had black
curly hair, a jutting jaw, eyes like gimlets, and pectorals on me like
buttocks. Smaller, admittedly, but Burt to the life. Later I began to
resemble Angel out of the Rockford Files. But a year ago a young lady
told me I resembled a star of stage and screen. ''Burt Reynolds?'' I
suggested hopefully. She was scornful. ''Angel, out of the Rockford
Files?'' More Scorn. ''Naw'' said the young lady, ''Youse look like
Rumpole of the Bailey''. And I did.
I looked exactly like Rumpole of the Bailey. Leo McKern always looked
like Rumpole of the Bailey: he was born to it and I was not. McKern
looked like Rumpole the very moment he hit these shores from his
antipodean island, and I did not not. McKern was born fat with a
complexion which appeared to be straight off a crocodile handbag -- with
handles -- and I was sent into the world with a face which Max Factor
would have gone out of business with. My coupon was smoother than a line
from Nicholas Parsons, or any accountants if it comes to that. And
suddenly there was yer Urban V without smoothness at all. Rumpole
indeed.
Now as it happens I have found myself re-reading Rumpole. I urge you
all to do so yourselves because it is refreshing to encounter John
Mortimer in spate. At a time when political correctness is vilified and
made nonsense of while it is practically informing the legislature and
the political process, we could all do with a nice little burst of
Mortimer cynicism, and common sense, and, perhaps, a Rumpolian sense of
mischief. Just the other day we were exhorted to outlaw boxing and
smacking children. Not a word of sense in either. You can't outlaw
boxing anyway, and such a venture in law would lead to bear baiting for
heaven's sake.
And any sensible parent knows that the odd slap across a juvenile bum
is most judicious when it comes to two-year-olds expressing their
individuality by poking a fork into an electric wall socket, and
extraordinarily effective for getting an eight-year-old to recognise
that ''this is not a hotel and you are not paying any rent either''.
Rumpole -- Mortimer -- is an old friend, or is it the other way round?
What I do know is that the both of them are thoroughly decent chaps who
are not barking mad in their advocacy of a civilised life.
I have been re-reading Rumpole. There is a story in I think the first
volume about a new sort of chap, the sort of new sort of chap who has
been around since time began. Mark Antony is an early one: so is
Jeremiah. Stick in Judas Iscariot, and look how he turned out. Thousands
of years worth of history and we have never yet got rid of these fellows
and their ilk. Mr Mortimer's story concerns Rumpole and two new
barristers in his chambers -- one called Sam Ballard (the ageing and
cantakerous Rumpole calles him ''Bollards'') and a beavering new comet
called ''Heartstoke''. Rumpole, clad in the decay of civilisation,
frequently addresses this object as ''Hearthrug''. Rumpole has his hands
full and his work cut out destroying these two modernisers. As in all
the best fiction he bests them. Reality is not always thus.
We can go back a lot further. Thurber, I recollect, has his Mr Martin
besting a Ms Ulgine Barrows (in a splendid story called The Catbird
Seat), another moderniser, packed full of the sort of new ideas which
get rid of jobs, impoverish both language and economies, and set about
destroying what might pass for a tradition. Usually what goes along with
such birds of passage and their keen enthusiasm is a touch of morality,
even a spot of evangelistic puritanism. I encountered it many years ago
when I was a school teacher. There was ever some idjit thinking up mince
for everybody else to do while they got on to higher planes, and higher
salaries, and left the rest in the misery of keeping themselves going
till they got their early retirement.
I recollect a little further. Fielding had his Mr Bliffel, George
Eliot her Mr Causubon: we have had several centuries of writers kicking
shite out of the unctuous, the oleaginous, and the unco-guid. Satirists
have wrested manfully with the most dreadful of the human species, the
greedy, the silly, the mountebanks of mayhem who wish to impose order
upon the creative mind. Dear heavens, even this blatt has its horde of
them. All I can say is that it is bad enough having an accountant as wur
chief executive. It could be worse. It could be a lady accountant. Who's
vegetarian and teetotal.
It has been said by some of our new, modern, vegetarian, female, and
teetotal journos on this paper that I am none of the above and all the
worse for it. Certainly I have spent a lifetime defending sense against
absurdity, and never winning. No matter how much satire Mortimer,
Fielding, Alexander Pope, Thurber, or even my humble self can heap upon
the sanctimonious, we never win. It is a long and depressing struggle.
Our problem is that we can never quite relish victory over the
vanquished. Decency is quite expensive at that -- which is why there is
ever some appalling little grub emerging with a new notion of drivel.
There was one not far away from my desk the other day. Not a word of
what she had to say failed to stir my blood and I was forced out to the
pub to solace myself with a large goldie and three fags. I moaned
vibrantly upon the matter and caught my throat with a fag and a libation
and indeed my reflection in the mirror of Tom's Bar. I don't look
anything like Burt Reynolds anymore. But an awful lot like Rumpole. I
think he knows what I am talking about.

LABOUR'S prawn cocktail offensive in the City and among industrialists
is getting to the teasing stage. The crustacean's head is off. There is
some tentative prodding round the innards. But getting the shell off and
at the juicy tail meat is proving a more protractedly frustrating pas de
deux.
Adair Turner, the new director-general of the CBI, says business is
not in the business of distrusting Tony Blair or his Shadow Cabinet.
What business fears most from an incoming Labour government, he argues,
is a reversion to decade-old type under the pressures of office.
The Blair revolution, he argues, has been so dramatic that those in
the business community now being wooed so assiduously are ''bound to be
left with a slightly queasy feeling whether it is for real''.
In private, business leaders I run into are more blunt. Some fear tax
hikes and a public-spending explosion. Others shudder at complying with
the provisions of the Maastricht social chapter. But most lose most
sleep over a resurrected union dragon, red in tooth and claw,
voraciously bent on settling 16 years of old scores on the shop and
office floor.
''Blair may well mean it. But can he deliver his party and his
supporters?'' sums up the mood. In trying to convince business that he
can, the Labour leader is mounting this phase of his offensive -- CBI
national conference speech next Monday, gala business dinner in Glasgow
early next month -- at a tactically propitious time.
First, business confidence is back in the bathchair, breathless and
more than a trifle uncertain, after a period breathing deeply of the
intoxicating air of recovery. The patient's present symptoms are mixed
but are giving increasing cause for concern.
There is still growth in the economy, albeit at a slower rate than
before. Some sectors remain relatively bullish. Engineering in Scotland,
for example, has reported improved order intakes for six consecutive
quarters. But, even there, improved volume is not being matched by
enhanced margins.
This week the Scottish Office's own index of production reported
quarter-on-quarter growth of 1.5% between April and June, against a flat
UK performance. But on a year-on-year basis, growth in Scottish output
is now running at less than half the UK rate. And that Scottish growth
is still dominated disproportionately by output from the electronics
sector.
On the steeper downside, the Scottish Council's index of manufactured
exports has fallen, against expectations, for three consecutive
quarters. This week's CBI/Business Strategies regional trends survey
says production in Scotland has actually fallen since the summer. And,
to underline the pressure on margins, the whisky industry is back into
heavy discounting just to shift cases in the critical pre-Christmas
period.
Such conflicting straws of evidence are reflected in the more fragile
mood within the business community. Optimism is fading in most CBI
regions, with only Scotland, the North, and the South-west still holding
out. The Institute of Directors has reported the most serious slump in
confidence among its members since we departed the exchange rate
mechanism in September 1992.
For Tony Blair, trying to persuade business he and Labour can deliver
must be a more achievable challenge in the current climate than it would
have been had recovery not taken on such a jaded, sickly hue.
Secondly, Labour's timing is propitious because business is
increasingly irritated by the Tory party's hostile line on Europe.
Opinion poll evidence is beginning to substantiate that. For example,
the findings of the European Cross-Border Investment Survey suggest
that, over the next three years, the UK is set to drop from second to
seventh place among the most popular investment locations for European
middle market companies.
Do potential investors perceive the UK as anti-European and so are
they beginning to exclude it from their investment strategy?
That sense that Europe is another place is not the work of Little
Englander Tory politicians alone: the survey discovered that, while 71%
of German and Austrian companies saw Europe as one regional market, only
16% of UK businesses took the same view.
But the increasingly strident anti-Brussels tone of the Government
must be helpful to Blair as he tries to persuade business where its real
self-interest lies.
The Labour leader's third potential ace may fall from the Budget pack,
if Kenneth Clarke fails to mask the nakedly party political nature of
his tax-cutting mission and sends the markets into freefall. The
Chancellor has, as we've noted before now, a tightrope to walk. A false
move or two and the Blair business offensive will have another stout
target in its sights.
But none of that fancy footwork will pay off unless New Labour can
defuse business's ''red menace waiting in the wings'' fears. To date,
Labour's tactic on that front has been to be seen to talk tough to the
unions and put some clear space between the two historic wings of the
movement.
I wonder increasingly why Blair and his colleagues are not equally
forthright with those they encounter on the prawn cocktail circuit. In
large measure, the transformation in British industry in recent years
has been achieved by driving cost out of companies and boosting
productivity. Except where this country has benefited from the inward
investment of others, late eighties/early nineties Britain has not been
a global hothouse of leading-edge technology and product innovation.
I am no apostle of inefficiency or feather-bedding. But the price of
that cost-cutting drive has been the jobs of many and the job security
of countless thousands more. Most of the people I know are working
significantly harder than ever before. Many are putting in far more
hours of work for, in real terms, the same money they were earning three
or four years ago. Stress is rampant.
Many of these same people have watched their most senior executives
and directors double, triple, and quadruple their basic earnings in the
space of a few years. And then there are the share options, bonuses, and
the rolling contracts to reinforce the contrasting treatment.
The trite response is to call it envy. But too many British companies
are now actively fostering a climate in which a resurgent trade union
movement with the power to deliver would attract enthusiastic recruits.
As his soft wooing of the business community rolls on, Tony Blair needs
to tell businesses that they too have a crucial role to play in securing
a strife-free industrial future.

WHEN the adventurer and explorer Christina Dodwell last gave a talk in
Scotland she was a trifle dismayed to discover that the audience was
largely made up of little old ladies in their one-button coats, handbags
clenched firmly on tightly drawn knees.
As she talked about her exploits among the Swagap warriors of Papua
New Guinea they nodded politely and offered a stout round of vigorous
but restrained applause when she finished.
''It was incredible,'' she recalled later. ''During coffee at the end
they came up to me, these tiny elderly women, and asked things like:
'How did you enjoy the Wahgi River, Dear? I recall it was quite
monstrously hot when I was there in, now was it '23 or '24? I can't
quite remember.'''
Such doughty endeavours from a different age would not surprise the
outside world, you suspect, where Scotland still enjoys a soft-focus
reputation -- much polished by this year's Hollywood gloss -- as a
country peopled by a spirited breed; romantics, adventurers, pioneers,
and poets.
If only they could see us now. The vision of Wallace -- the real
Wallace --turned to flabby, apathetic flesh, a people for whom risk is
trying a different flavour of Pot Noodle, for whom excitement is the
Christmas bumper edition of EastEnders. These days, our spirit comes
from a bottle and we get our passion from the furtive couplings of our
soap stars.
It speaks volumes about us as a country that the one word that now
seems to define us, the one word that we actually choose to draw the
parameters of our lives is ''wee''. A wee cup of tea, a wee dram, a wee
holiday, a wee bit of this, a wee bit of that, a wee way of life.
You can see it on the roads -- car after car of '''wee'' drivers,
Sunday-polished and straight-faced, hands on the wheel, numbed by radio
chatter and the muffled grunts of companions, slack-jawed and sleeping
in the passenger seat.
You can see it in the street -- where they walk to a clipped but
careful pace, desperate not to trip, to fall, to stand out. When was the
last time they ran? Not for exercise, but just to stretch, to move, to
feel their lungs fill up with air, their hearts beat faster.
Why is there no Scottish Dream like there is the American Dream? Why
can't we ever think big? Big like Wallace. Big like Northern Ireland,
where their dreams are shaping a bold, uncertain future. Big like
Quebec, where passion and ire and a gut-gnawing desire for change roused
a province and a country.
But we don't think big, and we don't know what we want, and we piffle
on about a parliament, and we toy with independence, and we tut about
injustice, and we wrap our world tighter around us like a dull-hued
cardigan, watching those who shine and push and take the risk with
narrow suspicion and quiet envy.
It's just that somewhere along the line we seem to have lost our
spirit and our sense of self, and sacrificed real risk and real reward
for the plastic thrill of living vicariously through others; other
nations, other races, sports stars, soap stars, film stars.
Much was made this week of an apparent 7% slump in support for the
Scottish National Party, blamed on the waning of the Braveheart factor.
Mel had let us down, said the analysts. The passion inflamed by his
celluloid exploits had only been a temporary buzz.
That political heavyweights would give credence to such a view -- that
all it would take is a quick twist of history wrapped up in fancy
fiction to put fire in our bellies -- is bizarre, but depressingly
believable. We have become the wannabe nation, the understudy, the
viewer not the doer.
There are still some -- a few -- who manage to take off or stand out
and perpetuate the pioneering Scotch myth. You can find them in all
corners of the earth; doughty, resourceful, willing to risk, and willing
to try. And maybe back home we hear about them and frown disparagingly
at their antics, and in some strange way be satisfied that someone,
somewhere has added spirit to their lives.
But at a showing of Braveheart in Perth recently, the audience sat
quietly throughout the whole film with only the occasional ''bleuch'' at
the bloodier cuts and thrusts of the battle scenes. At the end, as the
credits rose and the aisles emptied, one small elderly woman stood her
ground. ''Oooh, it fair gets your dander up,'' she said to no-one in
particular. Then she picked up her coat and followed the rest of the
audience, filing out in slow lines, zipping their jackets tight about
them and turning their faces from the first fresh burst of air to whip
in from the world beyond the cinema doors.

THE news that BP is attempting to claim copyright over a certain shade
of green (Pantone 348C, to be exact) and that it is being seriously
considered by the Trade Marks Registry, gives food for thought. The new
Trade Marks Act also allows the trademarking of sounds and smells.
Where, we speculate, will it all end?
If the telecommunications company trademarks orange, will we then be
faced with the Larkhall Right Loyal That Colour That Comes Between Red
And Yellow Lodge, or be singing The Pantone 348C, Pantone 348C Grass Of
Home? At risk of litigation, will we be hearing I Can't Sing A Rainbow?
It has been said by American comedian Scott Capurro that if you are a
male who knows what colour taupe actually is, it is indisputable
evidence that you are gay. Who is going to make the claim to copyright
taupe? And what of all the other catalogue colours like Chutney, Rain
Drop, and Hunter, all shades available in the new Racing Green
catalogue. Dolphin and Crocodile are two more, though Dolphin is in fact
a kind of red/blue bumbee tartan. Anybody out there seen a checked
dolphin?
Comedy cutups
AND another John Wayne connection. Robin Williams has turned down what
he calls ''The very important part of John Wayne Bobbit'' in a
forthcoming movie featuring the temporary amputee. The reason, and we
swear these are his words exactly, is that ''It's a very small part and
anyway, I think it might be cut.''
Still on the subject of the Bobbits, it would appear that the ex-Mrs
Bobbit is not to be further charged with any crime, after having been
found not guilty of genital truncation. Plans to prosecute her for
dropping litter have been abandoned.
Three's company
THE Leopard Rock Hotel, one of the most prestigious golfing hotels in
the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe, is wise in the ways of men and women
the world over. For its Honeymoon Suite, the most expensive it has, it
offers prices for one, two or three occupants.
Wowing audiences
SEVERAL suggestions have swum across the Diary's ken for a new and
snappier title for the West End Festival being organised by Michael Dale
for next June. David Holladay suggests The Kelvin Sideshow or The G12
Festival, while Michael Munro betrays his South Side origins with Texi,
Follow That Trend! and the rather surreal Is This Friday Night Or Byres
Road?
Bob Nummey of Rutherglen recommends that the events be severly
curtailed and then called The Cottier's Saturday Night. He also tried
Dowanhill All The Way and may have discovered a winner with WOW!, which
stands for Way Out-West.
Worth the wait
ALL these stories about the inhabitants of Furryboots City being less
than profligate with a bawbee are mere calumnies, as the following
example demonstrates. Aberdeenshire Unitary Authority has been looking
for a new Head of Communications for some time. It advertised the job
earlier this year at a salary of #35,500 and the highly communicative
Gordon Casely, currently press officer with Grampian Regional Council,
reached the short list of three but didn't get the job.
Nobody did, in fact. The AUA redefined the position and added an extra
#5000 to the salary. They then spent an additional three months and
#11,000 on advertising the post nationwide. Then they gave Gordon the
job.
Signally wrong
WHISTLING insouciantly into the Research? What's That? department
steps Simon Mills, scribbler for BTL, aka Between The Lines, BR's
Midland's magazine for Intercity travellers. In the course of a
four-page piece on Patsy Kensit, actress and wife of Jim Kerr of Simple
Minds, we are told that ''Officially, she's a Glasgow Rangers fan like
her husband, with a particular passion for the team's flamboyant
centre-forward, Ally McCoist.''
This will be news to the Parkhead legions and to Jim, who is widely
rumoured to have buried an Irish tricolour under the centre spot at
Ibrox when the band played there and who is not renowned for his support
of the boys in blue.
More equal than others
DR HALL of Campbeltown whose initials, M D, suit him perfectly, has
written to point out a full-page advert run by Strathclyde Education
recently, with a nice big slogan saying proudly ''An Equal Opportunities
Authority''. The ad is for jobs in teaching and one of the attached
codes -- 0 -- states quite clearly: ''Roman Catholic applicants only''.
Bog standard
A FURTHER Izal legend, that of the motorway cafe toilet, one of the
earlier ones, on whose wooden dispensing box was not written but carved:
''This is the John Wayne of toilet paper. It's rough, it's tough, and it

Like Glasgow, Seville suffers from its peripheral position in Europe.
Like Glasgow, Seville pinned its hopes of urban regeneration on a
massive flagship event, Expo '92. But Glasgow's problems in revamping
the garden festival site are a minor embarrassment compared with the
fiasco of the Expo site, as Anne Johnstone explains
THERE'S a joke going round Seville at the moment which goes something
like this: ''In 1991 everyone in Seville was a construction worker; in
1992 everyone was a waiter; in 1993 everyone was unemployed.'' Some of
the locals don't find it very funny.
Andalucia has one of the most stubbornly high unemployment rates in
Europe: 39.6% at the last count. Expo '92 was meant to put an end to all
that. Those bidding to bring the event to this sleepy backwater of
southern Spain argued that it would act as a catalyst for the
regeneration of the entire region, the same argument used to win support
for Glasgow's bid for the 1988 garden festival and the European City of
Culture mantle in 1990.
On one level Expo '92 was successful beyond the wildest dreams of its
organisers. The first event of its kind in Europe since 1958, it
involved the construction of more than 100 pavilions by participating
countries, international organisations and the Spanish regions. The
world's leading architects competed to produce the most beautiful and
innovative structures.
Around #750m in public (mostly Spanish Government) and private
expenditure went on the site alone. Visitor numbers far exceeded the 18
million anticipated by the organisers and for its duration there was a
buzz about Seville that lasted round the clock.
Andalucia has Objective 1 status under the EU's structural funds and
managed to exploit its position to the full in the run-up to 1992. As a
result, the area now boasts a comprehensive regional roads network.
Most significant of all, the Ave, a high-speed train, cut the journey
time from Madrid to Seville from nearly six hours to barely two and a
half, at a stroke pulling Andalucia towards the heart of Europe. At the
time, critics charged Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez with
favouring his old home city and ignoring economic common sense which
dictated that if any area was to get a fast rail link, it should be
Barcelona.
The Government countered with the argument that the Seville link was
necessary to prevent the poor south becoming unhitched from the
prosperous north, as in Italy.
By contrast with Glasgow, where there was no specific plan for the
re-use of much of the garden festival site, Seville's plans for the
Island of Cartuja were very detailed indeed. The site would become a
hi-tech science park where companies and institutions would set up their
research and development facilities, feeding their technological knowhow
to companies throughout the region.
Today grass is growing in the car parks. Glasgow may have had to cover
its blushes for seven years while the weeds grew on the site and various
factions argued the case for a Tivoli Gardens style park or a commercial
office development but finally the future looks fixed. Miller
Developments have just won planning permission for the construction of a
high-class business park and hopes are high that before the end of the
year, the Millennium Fund will come up with #40m towards a national
science centre on the site.
By contrast, in Seville the dreams have turned to nightmares. Most of
the pavilions have been demolished. Others have a dilapidated air.
Visitors are assured that the fine layer of rust all over Cartuja's
half-empty World Trade Center is a deliberate part of the original
design, but it seems sadly symbolic. Across the vast Expo site barely
1000 people are employed by just over 30 companies. Big names which had
promised to come, including IBM and Fujitsu, failed to appear.
The official line from Cartuja '93, the public company which runs the
site, is that the project is progressing slowly and has yet to reach
critical mass. But ADP, the organisation representing the companies that
have stuck it out there, is highly critical of the whole Cartuja
project. ''We've paid for maintenance and there hasn't been any. Our
companies have invested #15m in this island but it's tatty. Companies
can't buy their own sites and they can't produce here so it's hard to
see how we can help the local economy. There isn't even a bus service,''
says spokesman Javier Blanco.
There have been technical problems with everything from the
fibre-optic cables to the sewers. ''Some managers here believe that
Cartuja '93 needs to disappear,'' says Blanco.
A 70-acre theme park, alongside the science park, closed after running
into financial problems. Now most hope is pinned on Seville University
which is converting the American Pavilion into its new engineering
school.
Expo '92 may have done wonders for Seville's image. After all, if
anyone had asked you five years ago what you knew about the ancient
capital of Andalucia, you'd probably have come up with ''marmalade
oranges and Carmen''. Score a bonus if you remembered that Columbus
sailed from there to discover the New World. But a smart modern image is
doing little to stimulate a regional economy which sunk to its knees
almost the moment Expo closed.
Today many in Seville, while recognising the value of the
infrastructure investment, believe the millions spent on the Cartuja
site should have been directed to helping the small and medium-sized
technologically underdeveloped, under-skilled companies that dominate
the local economy. Only seven of Spain's top 500 companies are based in
Seville.
''The companies here aren't specialised enough to benefit from the
research being done by the very hi-tech companies attracted to Cartuja.
The Expo didn't serve the objective of helping the whole region. Other
technical parks, such as the ones in Valencia and Malaga, work much
better,'' says Inmaculada Caravaca of the geography department of
Seville University.
She says the region is also dogged by a lack of entrepreneurial drive.
''There's a higher proportion of civil servants in Andalucia than
anywhere else and it brings with it a sort of 'begging-bowl mentality'.
People here expect the Government to do everything for them,'' says
Caravaca.
You don't need to be a specialist to see that Seville, despite its
sultry beauty and outlandish charm, is not well equipped to compete in
the new ''Europe of the Regions''. The city seemed more full of lovers
than businessmen. This intrepid lone explorer with a briefcase felt like
the gooseberry on a giant romantic film set, full of serenading
guitarists and throbbing tapas bars. Charming indeed except that it took
visits to four different banks to obtain cash on a credit card.
With its well-preserved medieval quarter, winding streets too narrow
for cars, smart shops, sizzling climate and vibrant street life, Seville
is a natural for tourism. But the year after Expo, hotel occupancy
barely cleared 50%. To improve on that Seville needs better marketing.
In the long run it will also have to deal with its water problem. The
area has suffered a series of crippling droughts which make our summer
this year look like a brief warm spell. In Seville it has hardly rained
since 1990! Yet around 35% of all supplies leak from the city's
crumbling mains between source and tap.
''I think the administration has been slow to take different
initiatives for saving water,'' says Raul Limon, of the newspaper El
Pais. ''The rich still water their lawns while tenant farmers have so
little that their olive trees are dying.''
Typical of European peripheral cities, Seville suffers from the branch
economy syndrome. Last year 250 jobs were lost when Gillette abruptly
closed its plant, transferring the work to plants in Isleworth and
Berlin. The move provoked similar bitter protests as Hoover's decision
to switch work from France to Scotland.
Feelings were already running high in Andalucia over 600 job cuts at
Santana, a Suzuki subsidiary.
Each package of redundancies further erodes Andalucia's already
pathetically small employment base. Official unemployment is nearly 40%
and youth unemplyment well over 50%, though there is a thriving black
economy: witness the vast army of young street sellers and squeegee
wielders.
Though the birthrate has fallen sharply in the past decade, the
demographic profile of Andalucia is still youthful because of a high
birthrate in previous decades. The biggest age group is 25 to
30-year-olds. Many have never worked.
Their lack of hope is palpable in areas like the one known
colloquially as 3000 Viviendas (the 3000 households). It's like
Easterhouse with sun, except that even fewer here work. We go in along a
street lined with bright murals of Miro paintings but turn into the
scheme and recognise immediately that menacing blend of unremitting
drabness and smouldering anger: the broken glass, the empty streets, the
graffiti, the sense of people watching you and waiting.
We run straight into a drugs bust. An emaciated youth is spread-eagled
across the bonnet of a police car. This is an area where people perish
or survive on their wits. One local landed in court recently after the
city council discovered he had sold his council flat for half a million
pesetas (about #2750).
With Felipe Gonzalez out of office and in disgrace, Seville no longer
enjoys the political favour of central government. Despite all the new
roads, trains and bridges and about the best phone system in Spain,
Seville is faltering.
''In 1992 unemployment was below 30%. We thought we'd cracked it,''
says Limon of El Pais. ''After 1992 the crisis took us by surprise. It
was so big that it's made people afraid of the future. That's why the
property market is dead and nobody is buying anything. Now some believe
we're about to slide into a really deep economic crisis.''
I wouldn't disagree with them.

Ethiopian hijacker overpowered by special police unit as he calls his
own 'news conference'.
hens
GREEK police today overpowered a hijacker who held a knife to the
throat of an Olympic Airways stewardess. She was rescued unhurt.
A special unit rushed the man, dressed in a suit and tie, as he spoke
to reporters who were crowded in the doorway of the hijacked Boeing 747
at Athens international airport.
The man was at first thought to be called Kabret Shamsu, but later
identified himself as Melaku Mekebei, 32, an Ethiopian.
He had demanded to speak to the media and a UN official just before
the flight from Australia, with 119 passengers, landed at Athens
airport. He then demanded political asylum.
As he spoke to the press, several plain-clothes policemen suddenly
pushed through the reporters, snatched the flight attendant, Sofia
Mastelou, safely from Mekebei's grip and then wrestled him to the floor.
He had told reporters: ''There is no democracy in Ethiopia. Two
hundred journalists are detained for no reason.''
A Greek passenger said that while landing cards were being handed out
Mekebei started demanding to see an official.
He then pulled a knife and grabbed the flight attendant, who called
for help. The passenger said the flight attendant was pregnant.
Mekebei told police he hijacked the plane because he did not want to
go back to Ethiopia.
''He said he served six months in jail in Ethiopia in 1994 for
anti-government articles he wrote,'' police chief Christos Keramidas
said.
Mekebei served three months in an Australian jail for entering the
country illegally from Greece. After serving the sentence, he was put on
a plane back to Athens, police said.
Meanwhile a Jordanian airliner made an emergency landing at Keflavik
airport, Iceland, after a bomb threat. It was en route from Amsterdam to
Chicago with 224 passengers on board.
Three passengers, two women and a man, were detained for questioning,
but no suspicious objects were found.
On Tuesday a Jordanian jet flying from Amsterdam to Amman made an
emergency landing in Vienna after a bomb threat.--Reuter

PARIS: A Frenchwoman seeking a birth certificate discovered she had
spent four years married to a man she never met. Corinne Lefevre, 22,
was shown records of her 1991 wedding to a 31-year-old Moroccan from
Casablanca when she recently visited the City Hall in La Rochelle.
Her new-found marital state was brief, as she received a letter a few
days later from the City Hall saying a Paris court had divorced the
couple in May.
Lefevre's identity card was stolen four years ago. ''I think my card
has been forged to allow a false marriage so that my so-called husband
could get French nationality,'' she said. ''Once he'd got citizenship,
the marriage had no more point.''--Reuter.

From PATRICK BROGAN
Washington, Thursday
THE Bosnian peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, have achieved their first
success. The presidents of Bosnia and Croatia have agreed on ways of
improving the relations between Muslims and Croats in Bosnia, and
restoring the ancient and divided city of Mostar.
This success does not affect the continuing impasse over the future of
Bosnian-Serb relations and war criminals. At best, the better
understanding between two old enemies may make the third party more
amenable, because its hopes that Croats and Muslims might start fighting
again are fading.
President Franjo Tudjman, of Croatia, initialled the agreement with
President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia today. A formal treaty will be
signed tomorrow in the presence of the American secretary of state,
Warren Christopher, who is returning to Dayton for the occasion.
The agreement, which has been produced in two weeks' private
negotiations, provides for ways of strengthening the federation between
Croats and Muslims in Bosnia, for the return of refugees, and a
''unifying mechanism'' for Mostar.
The federation was the first achievement of American diplomacy. It was
agreed 18 months ago, and ended the tense stand-off between the two
sides, which had followed a vicious civil war.
In that war, a large part of Mostar, especially the Muslim sector, was
destroyed. The collapse of the magnificent Turkish bridge across the
river in Mostar was symbolic of the destruction of Bosnia, and the
continuing division of the city was symbolic of the hollowness of the
federation.
Croats had also engaged in ethnic cleansing during the war, driving
Muslims out of their homes in areas under Croat control. The new
agreement provides that they may now return.
This is a vital issue. Although Muslims and Croats have collaborated
against the Serbs on the battlefield, they continue to distrust one
another. Muslim refugees have not been allowed to return to their homes
in areas captured from the Serbs by the Croats. This agreement
presumably deals with that vexatious issue.
President Tudjman has been subjected to fierce pressure by the
Americans and by the EU. He has been told that there can be no question
of Croatia being admitted to the Union unless it settles the Bosnian
question on terms that Europe would approve.
The question of the Serbs remains as intransigent as ever. Mr Tudjman
has repeatedly said that if the question of Eastern Slavonia is not
settled by the end of this month, he will liberate it by force.
The Americans are equally adamant on the question of war crimes. The
Hague tribunal has today indicted three more Serbian officers for war
crimes, and President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has been told
that he must find a way of disposing of them, especially the two chief
Bosnian Serb leaders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, before any
settlement can be reached.
In another development, Russian President Boris Yeltsin today vetoed a
law calling for Russia unilaterally to lift sanctions against rump
Yugoslavia.
Russian MPs had passed the law in anger at Nato air strikes against
the Bosnian Serbs in August.
Yeltsin, who is recovering in hospital after a heart attack, told the
State Duma that the law would violate the constitution and break
Russia's international commitments.
Yeltsin's illness has dealt a blow to Moscow's efforts to boost its
profile in the Balkan peace process by forcing the cancellation of a
planned Moscow summit with the Balkan leaders.

New York
COLIN POWELL'S decision not to run for the US presidency makes
Republican Senator Bob Dole the odds-on favourite to face Bill Clinton
in the fight for the White House next year.
However, the day after Powell declared himself out of the contest,
voters seemed dissatisfied with the remaining field.
Snap polls showed a nation disappointed at the loss of Powell, a
Republican black with strong white support, as a potential alternative
to a Republican field led by Dole and to Clinton, never a great
favourite with the public.
An ABC television poll conducted after Powell's announcement showed
Powell would have beaten Clinton by 10 points, 52-42%. It also showed
Clinton had opened up a 10-point lead over Dole.
Powell, a retired four-star general and former chairman of the US
Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced yesterday that he lacked the passion or
commitment to make a run for president, a run in which the pundits and
polls said he had a good chance of winning.
Polls now show Dole, the Senate majority leader, an overwhelming
favourite to win the Republican nomination to contest Clinton in the
November 1996 election.
There might also be third-party bids by Texas billionaire Ross Perot,
who won nearly 20% of the vote in 1992 and helped Clinton oust
then-President George Bush, and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who
won most of the black vote during bids for the Democratic nomination in
1984 and 1988.
However a USA Today/CNN/
Gallup poll found half the voters want someone other than the known
quantities to jump in, and only 38% satisfied with those already
entered.
At his news conference, Powell said he had just joined the Republican
party and would try to influence the increasingly conservative party to
move back toward the centre.
Ex-President Bush, a moderate Republican, was clearly disappointed.
''Had he chosen to run, our nation would have been very well served,
but I respect his decision,'' said Bush, who had appointed Powell to the
Joint Chiefs leadership and relied heavily on his counsel during the
Gulf War.
''I only hope that in the future General Powell decides to participate
actively in the political process. We need such good men,'' Bush said in
a statement from his Houston home.--Reuter.

THE row over French nuclear testing in the South Pacific moved into
top gear as Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating repeated his
opposition to Britain's support for President Jacques Chirac.
The development at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in
Auckland follows John Major's robust defence of his stand backing
France's need to test its nuclear weapons. Both Mr Keating and New
Zealand's Prime Minister, Jim Bolger, are angry at the way France has
ignored the pleas of sections of the international community to halt
underground explosions.
The rift with Britain on the issue looks set to widen as Mr Keating
was reported to have said he had no intention of changing his mind at
the summit.
In an interview on Australian radio, he said no amount of
''post-decision rationalisation'' could make nuclear testing defensible.
He went on: ''There's no doubt the French will be calling up favours
all round the world among Commonwealth countries and it won't be
changing Australia's position. We will secure all we can from the
process, but our position will be crystal clear right through.''
Mr Keating said he wanted a clear condemnation of France in the final
communique.
Mr Major, though, has rejected any criticisms and said attacking
France would have been hypocritical for a nuclear power like Britain.
In an interview today with a New Zealand newspaper, he says: ''There
is no reason why Britain should be harangued for it. I have no intention
of changing my view on this matter.''
The Prime Minister was asked about the criticism of France's
resumption of nuclear weapons testing. He said nuclear deterrence had
played a vital role in the preservation of peace over the last 50 years.
''It still has an important role to play. Powers with nuclear weapons
have a responsibility to ensure that they are safe and reliable.
''Difficult decisions sometimes cannot be avoided and we have
expressed this view honestly from the beginning. There is no reason why
Britain should be harangued for it.''
* Greenpeace activists scaled a multi-storey insurance building in
Auckland to unfurl a nuclear protest banner opposite the conference
centre hours before the official opening ceremony.
The banner hanging from the 13th floor had the words: ''Major
disgrace'' and featured a picture of a Union Jack with President
Chirac's face in the middle.
Greenpeace campaigner Stephanie Mills said: ''We want to give John
Major a strong message that the New Zealand government and the
Commonwealth governments are outraged at his support of nuclear testing
and his failure to commit to any kind of nuclear disarmament for
Britain.''
PARIS: The Norwegian town of Sandnes has broken with a long tradition
of sending the Paris district of Montmartre a towering pine tree this
Christmas in protest at France's resumption of nuclear weapons tests.

Auckland
COMMONWEALTH leaders were tonight at the focus of world efforts to
secure the lifting of the death sentences imposed on the Nigerian human
rights campaigner Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists.
The heads of government, gathered in the New Zealand capital Auckland,
were facing demands for sanctions against the Nigerian regime, or for it
to be expelled from the Commonwealth altogether, unless a reprieve is
granted.
The issue overshadowed even the controversy over Britain's support for
French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, with the assembled leaders
divided on how best to proceed.
The growing pressure followed the confirmation by the Nigerian
Government that it would carry out the death sentence imposed on
54-year-old Mr Saro-Wiwa and his supporters from the country's minority
Ogoni people.
John Major said he believed the men sentenced to die by a military
tribunal had been convicted by a ''flawed judicial procedure'' and urged
the Nigerians to grant a reprieve.
''The sentences are not just,'' he said. ''I very much hope they will
exercise clemency and I would be very surprised if that was not a
general view among colleagues in the Commonwealth.''
Overseas Development Minister Baroness Chalker, also in Auckland, gave
a further demonstration of British support, meeting for 20 minutes with
Mr Saro-Wiwa's son, Ken Wiwa.
In London, the Foreign Office summoned Nigeria's acting high
commissioner Mr T Sodip for a meeting with officials to press for the
death sentences to be lifted.
A petition signed by more than 200 writers, including playwright
Harold Pinter, poet and Nobel prizewinner Seamus Heaney, and novelists
Norman Mailer, Margaret Atwood, and Isabel Allende, was organised by
International PEN.
Mr Saro-Wiwa's supporters were pinning their hopes on South African
President Nelson Mandela, attending his first Commonwealth summit, but
he said he favoured dialogue with the Nigerian regime rather than
sanctions.
''My own approach is to be in direct contact with them because I'm
interested in solving the matter and I will select that option which in
my view will be the most effective to address the problem,'' Mr Mandela
said.
He backed the appeals for clemency but declined to be drawn on what
should be done if persuasion failed.
''I would like to cross that bridge when I reach it. What we in South
Africa have been doing is to try and persuade the Nigerians to respond
to the international pressure and I would like to continue with that.''
That drew criticism from his friend and colleague Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, who criticised him for failing to take a firm enough stance.
He said that the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa had
consistently criticised the American policy of ''constructive
engagement'' towards the old Pretoria regime and said a similar policy
towards Nigeria now should be subject to the same criticism.
''We were scathing of President Reagan's constructive engagement
policy and said it would not achieve,'' he told BBC radio.
''It seems that anything similar to that is probably doomed to failure
and our approach has been doomed to failure. I told the President we
could not let this go on.''
Another black African leader, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe,
indicated his support for Nigeria's expulsion from the Commonwealth if
necessary.
''It is necessary to do everything in our power to impress on the
regime that clemency is the best thing for Nigeria to do, rather than
hang this individual.''
Nigerian Foreign Minister Chief Tom Ikimi said only that ''we're here
to discuss this issue. The issue is still under discussion''.
Mr Saro-Wiwa has campaigned on behalf of the 500,000 Ogoni people who
live in Nigeria's oil-rich south and say oil industry pollution is
destroying their land and water.
He and the eight other condemned men were found guilty early last week
of participating in the killings of four men during a political rally in
May last year.
In Lagos, the wives of the condemned men made a passionate apeal to
military leader General Sani Abacha to spare their husbands.
''We want to appeal to you as the last repository of justice in this
matter to temper justice with mercy and save the lives of our
husbands,'' they said in a statement in the oil city of Port Harcourt,
where the nine men are held.
It was signed by, among others, Ken Saro-Wiwa's wife Hauwa.
A Nigerian Government official denied rumours circulating overseas
that the nine were hanged early today. ''It is not true at all,'' said
the official.
However Nigerian human rights groups urged the West to act quickly.
''The haste with which the sentences were passed shows they are
determined to shed blood,'' the national president of the Civil
Liberties Organisation, Ayo Obe, said of the country's military rulers.
Brigadier-General Sam Malu, commander of the Nigerian army's 82nd
division, who announced the confirmation of the execution orders on last
night, ruled out any further hope of clemency.
The Committee for the Defence of Human Rights said in a statement:
''The government is more interested in blood-letting. There is no doubt
this is another dark hour for all.''

AN accountant with the Child Support Agency was caught by Customs
officers trying to smuggle almost 20,000 cigarettes through Glasgow
Airport.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard how Nicola Haslam, 20, of Logie Drive,
Larbert, had two suitcases containing 19,600 cigarettes when she was
stopped in the ''nothing to declare'' channel in April.
Customs officers said the total excise duty and VAT payable would have
been #2400.
Haslam, an operational accountant with the CSA, admitted she had
bought the cigarettes for #650 at a cash-and-carry warehouse in the
Canary Islands while on holiday.
She denied knowingly attempting to avoid duty by concealing them with
intent to defraud Her Majesty's Government, but was found guilty after
trial.
Haslam said she had understood the duty free barriers had been relaxed
and that the same EU regulations which applied across Europe also
applied to the Canaries.
Holidaymakers are permitted to bring only 200 cigarettes into the UK
from the Canaries.
When stopped and questioned on arrival at Glasgow, Haslam said she had
nothing to declare.
One suitcase was opened and found to contain 10,200 king size filter
cigarettes. The remainder were spread between another suitcase and a
holdall.
Haslam claimed that half of the cigarettes belonged to her boyfriend
and half were hers.
She intended to give some of the cigarettes to relatives and friends.
Some had given her money before she went on holiday to purchase
cigarettes for them.
Sheriff James Spy deferred sentence until November 30 after he was
told she might now lose her job.
He warned he was intending to impose a fine but stressed the scale of
the financial penalty would be governed by her ability to pay, and
continued the case for confirmation that she was to be dismissed as a
result of the conviction.

A COUNCIL member of the National Trust for Scotland yesterday called
on the organisation's 250,000 membership to demand a reversal of the
decision allowing Fife Hunt to cross trust land at Hill of Tarvit.
The Rev Archibald Black said from his Inverness home that the decision
went against the otherwise excellent work the trust carried out in
conserving places of historic interest or natural beauty for the nation.
The Church of Scotland minister warned of demonstrations and ugly
scenes if the hunt was allowed to go ahead and he critised the trust for
reversing withdrawal of consent, approved at its annual meeting in Troon
last February.
Mr Black said: ''Hill of Tarvit as trust property is open to the
public every day of the year and if the hunt comes through then there is
nothing but trouble in store.''
A 2000-signature members' petition could force an extraordinary
general meeting of the trust to further debate the issue, and he
therefore urged the membership to act on the issue.
''The reason for the original withdrawal of consent was because fox
hunting is highly contentious and divisive,'' he said. ''It damages the
trust's image in the public mind and weakens the body's ability to
fulfil the purposes for which it was founded.''
Mr Black said the task of the National Trust was to unite its members
behind agreed policies of conservation and the Hill of Tarvit decision
went directly against this ongoing policy.
''The trust is simply caving in to the pro-hunt lobby,'' he said.
''As a parish minister, it has been very difficult for me to give over
the time required to spend on this issue on behalf of ordinary people
but it is worth it.
''If this hunt goes ahead, it will do the trust an awful lot of harm
in the public's mind.
''It is not as if this organisation is short of land to hunt on.''

ILLEGAL immigrants in Scotland are being exploited by unscrupulous
employers who are packing them into overcrowded slums and paying them
only #80 for working a six-day week.
In some cases their own countrymen are extorting money from them in
return for not reporting them to the police or immigration officials,
according to Glasgow lawyer Dilip Deb, who specialises in immigration
law.
Mr Deb claims that illegal immigrants who have lived in the country
for more than five years and are self-sufficient should be given an
amnesty by the Government and allowed to remain officially.
He says such an amnesty would halt the exploitation of such people.
The lawyer estimated that there are 150 to 200 such illegal immigrants
in Scotland, often working in restaurants. ''They are low paid and
exploited by their employers due to their immigration status. They are
generally single and live three to four persons in a room supplied by
the employers,'' he said.
An amnesty would also cut down on the tension caused in ethnic
minority communities, according to Mr Deb, by dawn raids by police and
immigration officials looking for illegal immigrants.
There is also concern among Asians about the growing practice of
keeping political asylum seekers in prison in Scotland.
''An increasing number are being detained in Scottish prisons, where
they are confined to their cells for most of the day and have no
practical alternative but to eat Western food that they are not
accustomed to,'' said Mr Deb.
The Government is expected to introduce a Bill in the next session of
Parliament which would tackle illegal immigration. One suggestion is
that employers would be prosecuted if they were found to be employing
people who did not have proper status.
Such a suggestion has been criticised by employers' organisations, who
say it would be too heavy a burden for them to become unofficial
immigration officers.

Emissary's bid to save Maxwell group.
HIGH-ranking Israeli diplomat told the Old Bailey yesterday how he
tried to arrange a #400m rescue bid for the Maxwell group because he
felt indebted to Robert Maxwell.
However, Dr David Kimche said neither of the Maxwell brothers, Kevin
and Ian, told him about the huge pension fund liabilities and when he
learned about them from press reports he wanted nothing more to do with
the deal.
Dr Kimche, the retired director general of the Israeli foreign
ministry and a roving ambassador at large, said he knew that after
Robert Maxwell's sudden death at sea, the shares in his group plunged
and that his sons urgently needed cash in a bid to prop up the ailing
empire.
He met them in London to see if he could find someone willing to
invest in the group. ''I didn't do it for a fee or for a cut. I was
doing it as a favour,'' he told the court.
He felt indebted to Robert Maxwell because of the help he had given
him through his Russian contacts in enabling Russian Jews to leave for
Israel.
Dr Kimche said he immediately thought of his friend Roger Tamraz as a
possible investor because he knew he was very wealthy, a brilliant
businessman, and had extensive contacts with the Arab Gulf states.
Describing how he first met Mr Tamraz, he revealed that the
businessman had been a secret emissary from the Lebanese Government to
the Israeli Government in the 1980s, when the two countries were
fighting.
Mr Tamraz followed Dr Kimche into the witness box on the 100th day of
the Maxwell brothers' trial.
Cross-examined by Mr Richard Lissack QC, for the prosecution, Dr
Kimche said he believed the reason the rescue bid failed was because
time ran out.
He added that he had come to court voluntarily to give evidence
despite personal difficulties over events in Israel in the past few
days.
Dr Kimche described Mr Tamraz as the richest man in the Lebanon.
Mr Tamraz then told the court he was the president and chief executive
of Oil Capital Inc, a private company dealing with ''project
financing''.
He said he believed the injection of #400m would have saved the
Maxwell empire and the deal was a realistic proposition which would have
saved it.
He agreed when cross-examined by Mr Lissack that an arrest warrant had
been issued for him by a Lebanese court accusing him of a $200m fraud,
that he had been jailed for two years in his absence in Jordan, and had
been ordered by a Paris court to pay $56m to a French bank.
However, he was not guilty of any fraud and the accusations were part
of a plot to stop him from running for the presidency of the Lebanon.
''That's politics in the Middle East.''
He added that in Lebanon he had been kidnapped and tortured.
Mr Tamraz, who studied economics at Cambridge and Harvard
universities, said his financing projects included the Caspian oil
pipeline, luxury hotels in Paris, and the Lockheed aircraft company.
He said he had never met Robert Maxwell and only met his sons once, in
the Maxwell penthouse suite when they discussed the investment. He said
the Maxwells were in a hurry -- ''they wanted the money yesterday''.
He was aware there were inter-company debts and not sure if the
pension fund debts had been mentioned.
Mr Tamraz said he was attracted to the group, which ''had taken 30
years to build up and could be bought in three months'', because of its
media interests which he thought would be attractive to Arab investors
keen to get into international communications.
He said he was not there to save the Maxwells but was interested in
the company. He was ''interested in a good deal''. Commenting on his
presence in court, he said he had come at his own expense ''to give the
facts''.
He said the deal fell through because the Maxwells lost control of
MCC. Even then, he was still prepared to invest and had backers in mind
but nobody contacted him about it. He had read about the pension fund in
the press after the deal was off.
The trial continues.

Love them or hate them, you just can't ignore the neighbours. Two
conferences look at either end of the spectrum.
RGET the Aussies. When it comes to good neighbours Scotland is streets
ahead of the rest of the UK.
The finding, from the General Accident Good Neighbours survey, is just
one of the startling differences between the neighbourliness shown by
people living in different parts of Britain.
On the eve of the fourth National Neighbourhood Watch Conference, the
survey reveals that neighbourliness in Britain is alive and well, but
more could be done to make this friendliness with people next door a
more positive force within local communities.
Nine out of 10 people interviewed (90%) said their neighbours were
pleasant, friendly people who keep their property in good order. The
Scots score here is 93%.
Almost as many (81%) rate the people next door as considerate
neighbours who keep their gardens neat and tidy. Scots score 88%.
Overall, 69% said their neighbours were good. In Scotland the figure is
80%.
However, despite this generally positive picture there is evidence in
the poll that neighbourly relations in Britain tend to be superficial
rather than mutually supportive.
In terms of trust, only 56% claimed to completely trust the people
next door. Scots here score 66%.
Asked about Britain's most unpopular neighbours, people plumped for
drug abusers (87%), heavy drinkers (61%), and people with criminal
records (50%).
The benefits of neighbourhood watch are emphasised with 61% of people
living in these areas showing complete trust in their neighbours
compared with 54% of those living in other areas.
A Scot who symbolises good neighbourly qualities will tomorrow be
presented with the Neighbourhood Watch Medal for Scotland.
Mr James Sime, from Falkirk, will receive his medal from Home
Secretary Michael Howard at the NNWC conference in London.
Mr Sime has been involved with Neighbourhood Watch for almost a decade
and has established local schemes as well as a district forum to
exchange good practice and ideas.
Mr Nigel Whiskin, chief executive of Crime Concern, said: ''Mr Sime is
a credit to his community. As this year's medal winners demonstrate,
vigilance and information gathering is just part of the grass roots
activities intended to protect the vulnerable, strengthen the community
and enhance the quality of life for everyone.''

DISPUTES between neighbours are causing some people so much despair
they are being driven to suicide or murder, a conference in Aberdeen
heard yesterday.
Aberdeen District Council is the first city council to introduce a
helpline to try to ensure that complaints and disputes never reach such
proportions.
Mr Mike Robbins, an independent housing consultant from Cathedral
Housing Ltd in Stirling, told the conference on tackling neighbour
problems that there were cases where disputes had become so serious that
people ''have either physically thrown themselves from the top of large
buildings or have been physically attacked and that has resulted in
death''.
He said that, although he was unaware of any such cases in Scotland,
there were three or four on record in England last year. Disputes could
cause tremendous tension.
''The stress is generated by the dispute because people become so
entrenched in their positions they become hostile and react physically
to each other,'' he said.
Mr Mike Scott, Aberdeen City Housing Officer, said people were
suffering severe medical problems because of friction with neighbours.
''They are regularly suffering ill health as a result of neighbourhood
disputes. It can be repeated noise, people feeling they are being spied
upon, people feeling their property is being destroyed by a specific
person, even if it is not that person.''
He said the council was receiving between 15 and 20 complaints a day
about anti-social behaviour by neighbours and on average it was dealing
with 13 to 14 severe cases a month.
''We have 13 cases that are causing continual difficulty and are tying
up a fair degree of our resources and time,'' he said. ''Probably half
are related to noise.''
The six-month pilot scheme will enable council tenants to get advice,
counselling, and impartial support outwith office hours. Staff will be
on duty until 1.30am Monday to Friday and from 6pm to 2.30am on
Saturdays and Sundays.
''Most neighbour problems occur outwith normal working hours and we
believe tenants who are continually subjected to distress due to a
neighbouring tenant late in the evenings or the weekend require
support,'' said Mr Craig Stirrat, the council's principal housing
officer.
Staff will explain to callers what the tenants can do, what the
council can do, and how to contact other agencies such as the police or
environmental development department who may be able to deal with the
problem.
Where applicable, the staff, who will work in pairs, will have access
to cameras and video equipment which they could use during a visit to
corroborate and record evidence of anti-social behaviour.
However, Mr Stirrat said: ''It is not a snoop squad. Staff are there
to try to act as good neighbours to try to provide a pro-active service
and help resolve the problem.''

THREE prison officers from Barlinnie in Glasgow are expected to appear
at Glasgow Sheriff Court within the next few days in relation to
incidents involving prisoners at the jail.
The allegations were first made in a BBC Scotland television programme
a month ago. The three officers were suspended from duties by the
Scottish Prison Service earlier this week.
The men are expected to appear on petition before a sheriff in the
first instance. The Crown Office confirmed that Glasgow's procurator
fiscal had started proceedings.
At the time of the disclosures an attempt by the Scottish Prison
Officers' Association, the main prisons union, to have the programme
stopped by interdict was rejected at the Court of Session by Lord
Kirkwood, who said he was not persuaded that the screening would
prejudice the rights of the officers to a fair trial.

A CAITHNESS offshore engineering firm was awarded a #30m North Sea
pipeline contract yesterday.
The deal means around 100 jobs will be created at the Rockwater yard,
10 miles south of John O'Groats.
The subsea contract -- placed by the Italian state-owned oil-company
Agip -- also means work for Barmac's yard at Nigg on the Cromarty Firth,
where heavy equipment needed to tie in the pipes to wellheads will be
made.
In the past, union representatives at the Barmac yards at Nigg and
Ardersier have been critical of the Italians, accusing them of using
subsidies to undercut bids by Scots yards for major oil-rig contracts in
the North Sea.
The pipelines are technically known as ''flow-line bundles'' -- a
Scottish concept developed at the Wester Yard near Wick, where 25 have
been manufactured over the last 16 years on a specially-built
railway-track laid five miles inland from the fabrication workshop.
The two ''bundles'' up to four miles long and each consisting of a
several smaller pipelines inside an outer protected steel cover, will be
towed to the Thelma Field next May for installation.
This is the first time Agip has used this technology, which has added
up to 20% to the world's recoverable reserves of offshore oil and gas.
Other companies in the Highlands are expected to get sub-contracts
from the Italian order, which has been obtained by the three companies
which are part of the Aberdeen-based Rockwater group, owned by the
Halliburton Corporation of Houston, Texas.

A COUPLE posing as police officers tried to abduct a 20-year-old
woman, detectives said yesterday.
The incident happened at 4am on Wednesday in Carrick Street, Glasgow.
The woman and a male friend were walking home when they were challenged
near the Montrose Bar by the couple who got out of a burgundy car.
They claimed to be plain-clothes police officers then ''arrested'' the
woman and put her in the car. Her friend was allowed to go. The woman
became suspicious and after a struggle managed to escape, uninjured.
Detective Sergeant John Ferguson at Cranstonhill police station
appealed last night for help in catching the impostors.
The man was 28 to 30-years-old, with short dirty-fair hair, clean
shaven, and of broad build.
The woman was 28 to 30-years-old, had dark brown shoulder-length hair
tied back, a round face, small button nose, was about 5ft 7ins tall, and
was wearing denim trousers, a patterned white jumper, dark blue jacket,
and grey earrings.

THREE people in Lothian became ill after drinking flavoured milk made
by a Manchester firm whose products were being withdrawn from shop
counters yesterday.
The three, one in Edinburgh and two in West Lothian, complained of a
burning sensation after drinking the milk, from Lancashire Dairies. They
were among 30 people in Britain affected.
An Edinburgh District Council spokeswoman said bottles with a
best-before date before March 17, 1996, had been withdrawn. The 500ml
plastic bottles had a sealed foil cap covered by a plastic screw cap.
She said there was concern that bottles might still be on sale at small
distributors. Bottles might also be stored in homes because of their
six-month shelf-life.
''It is important people do not drink the contents and should return
the bottles to the shops where they were bought,'' she said. Council
staff were checking all retail outlets, she added.
A Scottish Office spokesman said that although the bottles might not
leak, bacteria could have entered and caused souring at some point after
sterilisation.
Some affected bottles fizzed, could froth on opening, and had an
acidic taste or chemical smell, he said.

of her son Craig -- dubbed the ''timeshare tot'' by the tabloid press.
Sheriff Grant McCulloch at Falkirk told McKie that he owed so much in
fines, he had considered a jail sentence, a decision supported by
background reports. However Sheriff McCulloch added: ''I don't want to
have an unwitting part in resolving a custody dispute in which you
appear to have some peripheral involvement,'' and deferred sentence for
six months.
McKie's lawyer, Mr Andy Bryson, had told the court McKie had
previously had a drink and drugs problem.
He said McKie, who is unemployed, had resolved his drugs problem and
given up drink. He hoped to finish his apprenticeship as a panel beater
with his father, who planned to set up a car-repair business.
Mr Bryson said McKie was in a relationship with Elaine Maxwell ''who
is involved in a very nasty dispute with her parents''.
The lawyer added: ''Her parents snatched her child from her.'' He said
the harrowing tug-of-love was a ''very long and bitter dispute''.
He continued: ''Mr McKie is taking a great part in that dispute. He is
standing by her and wants to act as the child's father.''
He added: ''He is very concerned that if the court imprisons him
today, it will give the other side a lot of ammunition because they are
already accusing him of being a drug addict.''
In a civil court hearing earlier this week, the toddler's grandparents
Richard and Helen Maxwell branded McKie ''an alcohol and drugs abuser
with four pages of previous criminal convictions''.
The hearing was told that the Maxwells removed Craig from the home
Elaine shared with McKie because they were frightened for his safety.
Sheriff Albert Sheehan ordered an investigation into the custody
battle and ruled that Ms Maxwell would have Craig from 9am to 5pm each
day. She would then hand Craig over to her parents Richard, 52, and
Helen, 51, who live round the corner from her.
The ''timeshare'' arrangement lasts until next week, when it will be
reviewed. A full custody hearing will be held later this month.
As he left court yesterday, McKie said: ''I can't thank the sheriff
enough for giving me this chance. I'm determined to make the most of it
because I want to act as a proper father to Craig.
''I was terrified I would go to jail. I don't want to do anything that
would affect Elaine's chances of having Craig at home full-time.''
Ms Maxwell said: ''I'm truly grateful to the sheriff for giving Roy --
and Craig and me -- this chance.''

<HEADLINE>Court told of Fife family's ordeal at gunpoint on Guy Fawkes Night</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975454488</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A BOOKMAKER told yesterday how he left his sobbing little girls in the
family home as his wife waited outside in a car with a gunman.
Mr Joseph Campbell, 36, said he was ''covered in blood'' from an
earlier injury inflicted by Mr Brian Martin when he came face to face
with his daughters, aged eight and 11, early in the morning.
''Both were standing in the hallway crying. I told them not to worry
and to telephone next door to their aunt,'' he told the High Court in
Edinburgh.
He then went out to where his wife was waiting with Mr Martin, who had
a sawn-off shotgun, to drive to his business and get money for the
gunman.
Mr Campbell said the family's ordeal began after midnight on November
6 when he got up to answer a knock at the door of their home in
Lochleven Road, Lochore, in Fife. He and his wife, Catherine, and their
children had gone to bed after setting off fireworks on Guy Fawkes
Night.
''I realised who it was before I opened the door,'' he said.
He identified the caller as Mr Brian Martin, 38, who is on trial after
denying a series of armed raids and police assault.
Mr Campbell said Mr Martin pushed past him into the hallway and he saw
he was armed with a sawn-off shotgun: ''I heard words like: 'You grassed
on me. Why did you grass on me?' The gun was pointed under my chin.''
Mr Martin asked where his wife was and he indicated upstairs. ''He
asked me to call her down. I tried but I could hardly speak because this
gun was pushed into my throat.''
Mr Martin then asked where the safe was. ''I tried to calm him down a
bit and tell him there was no safe in the house,'' he said.
Mr Campbell said his wife was screaming. Mr Martin lifted the gun and
tried to strike him on the face with it and he was hit a ''severe blow''
on the arm by the weapon as he attempted to fend off the blow.
Mr Campbell said that eventually he persuaded the gunman that there
was no cash in the family home.
''He then said, 'We will have to go where the money is.' I had
probably said the only money would be in the safe in the shop,'' he
said.
The court earlier heard that Mr Campbell owned a betting shop, Top
Sport Bookmakers, and a licensed grocers within yards of each other in
Martin Crescent, in Ballingry, Fife.
As Mr Campbell put on his shoes, he told the court that Mr Martin
said: ''I have got a good mind to blow your head off.'' Mr Martin, he
said, pushed the barrels of the gun into his face.
''I felt the blood running down my shoulders and chest. The blow had
burst open my face,'' he said.
Mr Martin told the couple that they were going to the shop to get
money. The Campbells got into the front of their Mercedes with Mr Martin
in the rear.
As Mr Campbell drove to the shop, he realised he had forgotten the
keys to the premises.
He told Mr Martin he would have to go back for them. Mr Martin agreed
but added: ''I hope this isn't a trick.''
Back at the family home, Mr Martin told him to go in alone and come
right back after he collected the keys, he said.
''My daughters were both standing in the hallway crying,'' he said. He
told them not to worry and to phone an aunt.
He returned to the car and drove to the store in Ballingry, getting
two days' takings, between #1500 and #2000, from the safe.
''He took the cash from the bags, looked at it and asked where the
rest was. I told him that was all there was. He said something to the
effect that there must be more than this,'' said Mr Campbell.
The father-of-two said the only other cash he had would be in the
nearby betting office. He said Mr Martin told him to get it and that his
wife would stay in the shop with him.
Mr Campbell said he went to the betting office and found only about
#400. He added: ''I didn't think another #400 was what he expected. I
started to think to myself, what's going to happen?''
He decided to call the police. While he was on the phone to them, he
realised from the ''call waiting'' system that someone was trying to get
through to him.
Mr Martin came on the line and asked why he was taking so long. ''He
put my wife on. By this time she was screaming hysterically for me to
hurry up,'' said Mr Campbell.
Mr Campbell said he was still in the betting office when he heard a
crash from outside and the sound of breaking glass followed by his wife
screaming. He ran out to see his wife running towards a police van.
Mr Martin, described as a prisoner, has denied assaulting Mr and Mrs
Campbell, abducting them and robbing them of #2000.
He has also denied taking part in an armed #8500 raid at Glencraig in
Fife in 1992 and robbing a building society in Oban of #4639 last
November and of menacing two police officers with a sawn-off shotgun in
Ballingry on October 29 last year.
The trial continues.

SCOTTISH Natural Heritage, the Government's conservation agency, said
yesterday it had reached agreement with the developers of a proposed
landfill site near Falkirk which will protect the few remaining ancient
semi-natural gorge woodlands in the district.
Historic Scotland has already said it is opposing the development by
Scotia Environmental Services because it would obliterate the remains of
three Roman camps and breach the Antonine Wall. The landfill tip is
planned for a 100-acre site at Inveravon Farm, beside the Avon Gorge,
which is itself a Site of Special Scientific Interest.
However, yesterday, a spokeswoman for SNH said that planning
conditions had been agreed at the current public local inquiry which
overcame the agency's concerns about the development's impact on the
SSSI.
Original plans for the landfill would have involved cutting a corridor
of mature trees through the site. In addition, water flowing under the
landfill site and into the gorge would have created a risk of pollution.
However, the new conditions include diverting both a power line and
the watercourse away from the SSSI.
Mr Richard Ferguson, regional planner for SNH, said: ''We are
satisfied that, should the development proceed, the agreed conditions
present the optimum means of protection for the SSSI.''

FORTY-TWO female machine workers were taken to hospital for emergency
treatment for respiratory problems and skin rashes after a chemical
scare at a clothing factory yesterday.
Around 1000 workers at the Daks-Simpson clothing plant in Larkhall,
Lanarkshire, were sent home following the alert and manufacturing
operations were suspended.
Several of the affected workers were taken from the factory in a state
of collapse and more than 20 of them received injections from paramedics
to dilate their lungs and aid breathing.
All were suffering from the effects of inhaling fumes which created
rashes on exposed areas of skin.
The workers were taken to three hospitals in Lanarkshire. Two were
still being detained last night in Monklands Hospital, Airdrie, one
suffering from chest pains.
The outbreak follows a similar scare on Wednesday and takes the number
to become ill among the factory's 1700 workforce to 58, all of them
women, since the first were affected on November 2.
Following the original scare, the company were advised by
dermatologists at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and employed specialists to
clean ventilation ducts and affected work areas.
However, last night, Daks-Simpson, the sixth largest manufacturing
employer in Scotland, confirmed that workers were being asked to report
for duty today and that the decision as to whether to continue the
suspension of operations had not yet been taken.
Scotland managing director Kevin Johnson said: ''The problem appeared
last week when several workers complained of skin irritation.
''As soon as that outbreak occurred, we brought in dermatologists to
inspect the factory, talked to workers, and took advice from the health
and safety executive.
''Since then complaints continued to drop until today. Obviously our
original action was not robust enough.''
He added: ''Everyone who has required treatment has been taken to
hospital and we are contiuning to work with the HSE until the cause of
the problem has been found.''
DAKS chief executive Jeremy Franks, who flew up from London earlier in
the week, admitted the company were no nearer to discovering what had
triggered the outbreak.
''The problem is that we are fighting a hidden enemy,'' he said.
''There have been girls for whom it has gone practically as soon as it
has come. It is difficult to say what is wrong when the experts are
searching for the problem.''
Fire crews and police evacuated parts of the factory where employees
had been affected and cordoned it off from the public yesterday shortly
after noon.
Firemen took air samples to discover the cause of the attack.
A spokesman for the ambulance service described workers ailments as an
''allergic chemical reaction''.
Machinist Lizzie Grenfell, 24, who was taken from the plant by
stretcher yesterday, said: ''I was sewing away and talking to the woman
next to me when I felt my heart start beating really fast.
''I started to feel really dizzy and found that I couldn't move my
legs.
''Then I found that I was breaking out in a rash. I put my head down
and then the next thing I knew I was in hospital. It's been horrific in
the factory.''
Mrs Eileen Oliphant, 26, who has been off work since Monday after
suffering skin irritation and swelling said: ''The company has not said
anything about it to the workforce which, is unusual. Normally the
management are very good at telling us things.
''Some of the girls said they thought it was something to do with the
fabrics used or the ventilation system but no-one knows.''

BBC Scotland's Outside Broadcast Unit, threatened earlier this year
with closure, has been saved.
After a four-month strategic review of resources, local management has
emerged not only with the key department intact but also with an extra
#750,000 to improve equipment.
A senior official said that all 38 jobs in the OB Unit, without which
both the current affairs and sports departments could not function, were
secure.
The main mobile scanner in Scotland would be upgraded and, for the
first time in three years, a second scanner would be made available to
Queen Margaret Drive. It too would be crewed by Scottish personnal.
Earlier this year, and only days after the closure announcement of the
design and costume departments with the loss of 100 jobs, it was
disclosed that the OB Unit was being put out to tender and that an
English independent company was in line to get the contract.
But BBC Scotland management, in the face of strong criticism, then
halted the tendering process and announced its intention to hold a
wide-ranging resources review instead.
The review's conclusions, announced to staff yesterday, stresses the
importance of the integrated planning and operation of Scottish studios
and OB Units.
A year ago Queen Margaret Drive's biggest studio, Studio A, together
with Radio Studio One in Edinburgh, were considered under threat because
management reckoned there was insufficient projected programme income to
meet their total costs.
However, according to the review, a significant increase in network
commissions -- #24m last year and expected to rise this year -- has
ensured that Studio A is now regarded as an important strategic asset
for programme making.
As a result, an additional #600,000 is to be invested in upgrading the
equipment and refurbishing the studio.
The future of the Edinburgh radio studio is slightly more tentative.
Radio Scotland does not require it on a full-time basis, but it will be
kept in part-time use.
A further #445,000 is to be invested in resources for Radio Scotland.

A PLEDGE that the new Edinburgh City Council would invest #300,000 in
facilities for cycling in its first year was given yesterday.
Councillor David Begg, chairman of the transportation committee of the
outgoing Lothian Regional Council, said it was crucial that current
transport plans for the whole of Lothian were continued after local
government reorganisation.
As well as committing #300,000 to cycling, the new council would have
at least one dedicated cycle officer, would maintain cycleways
regularly, and would set up a Lothian cycle network working group, he
said.
Mr Begg, who was addressing the cycling group, Spokes, said the new
authority would aim to increase the number of journeys to work by
bicycle in Edinburgh from 2% in 1991 to 4% in 2000 and up to 10% by
2010.

IMPASSIONED pleas for investment in higher education were made
yesterday by the Principals of two of Scotland's new universities.
Professor Bernard King, Principal of Abertay University in Dundee,
warned that the economy faced the bleakest of prospects unless more
resources were put into higher education.
And his counterpart at Paisley University, Professor Richard Shaw,
said institutions were finding it more difficult to make savings and
maintain standards.
Student funding had been reduced by about 25% and was projected to
fall by as much as another 10%.
Yet the care and attention of lecturers towards students -- frequently
commented upon in teaching assessments -- were being put at risk because
fewer staff were having to take on more undergraduates.
Professor Shaw was addressing a ceremony for graduates of the
university's Cats programme, which gives mostly-employed people
opportunities to study at their convenience for nationally-recognised
awards.
Professor King told an Abertay graduation ceremony that funding was
the biggest challenge.
Without investment Britain's ''knowledge industry'' would go the same
way as many of the economic giants of the past.
Scottish universities had improved their productivity by 40% in a few
years, an achievement which would have been rewarded with further
investment in industry.
But, said Professor King: ''University communities are faced with
over-used and increasingly dilapitated premises, greater student
hardship, and stagnant academic pay.
''Is it any wonder that the efficiency and effectiveness of our
university sector should now be threatened?'' he asked.
Without investment, there loomed the unthinkable spectre of ''an
uncultured industrial and commercial wasteland bereft of quality of life
and incapable of supporting a modern technological society.''
Receiving honorary degrees from the University of Abertay yesterday
were comedian Rikki Fulton and veteran BBC newsreader John Humphrys.
Honourary degrees were also conferred on artist Dr James McIntosh
Patrick and scientist Professor David Telford.
Paisley University awarded an honorary doctorate to Nurse Sheila
Wilson, from the town, who has risked her life helping victims in the
world's famine and war zones.
She has worked in trouble-stricken countries like Ethiopia, Somalia,
Uganda and Afghanistan.
In the Queen's Birthday honours earlier this year she was awarded the
Meritorious Service Cross for her work with the Red Cross in Tanzania.
* The former Principal of Glasgow University, Sir William Fraser, is
to chair the group given the task of setting up a new agency responsible
for quality and standards in higher education.

Brussels
THE European Commission last night was preparing to protect salmon
farmers in Scotland after renewed complaints that the Norwegians were
dumping stocks throughout the European Union.
Officials in Brussels said they were stepping up the monitoring of
production and supply levels after approaches from Scots producers.
The crisis in the Scottish salmon farming industry appears to be a
re-run of last year's events when the Norwegians were accused of dumping
180,000 tonnes of salmon in EU markets after taking unfair advantage of
massive government subsidies.
A year ago, the Commission intervened and increased the minimum import
price, a move which protected Scots and Irish producers from the worst
effects of Norwegian competition.
Mr William Crowe, chief executive of the Scottish Salmon Growers'
Association, said yesterday: ''We have written to the Commission and all
we need now is some action from the Scottish Office. It is not just us,
the Irish are screaming as well.''
Mr Crowe said the market had dropped 30% as Scots growers had
predicted it would. ''We must have a re-introduction of the minimum
import price as a temporary safeguard,'' he said.
He added that salmon prices had gone through the EU's floor to #2 a
kilo, delivered to the EU. ''We think the price should be #2.60 at
least. The Scots are being dragged down to #2.50 or #2.30 a kilo
delivered to the EU importers,'' he said.
A Commission official said: ''We will act when we have firm evidence
from the member states. Until then we cannot do anything except look
closely at the whole area and study what is happening. We have asked the
Scots, Irish, and French to provide evidence of dumping causing a
collapse of the market price. So far, no evidence has been received.''
Observers in Brussels calculated that the Norwegian threat could be
seen off if the Commission imposed a limit on imports. One theory was
that the limit would be based on average Norwegian exports to the EU
over the past three years. The effect of this would be to reduce current
imports by about 20%.
The Scottish Office has pledged to watch the EU salmon market ''very
closely''. Fisheries Minister Raymond Robertson returned last night from
talks with his opposite number in Norway, Jan Olsen.
Mr Robertson said there was concern at the drop in European market
prices and that the matter would be raised again at meetings in Oslo
next week.

<HEADLINE>Fisherman in #1m damages claim</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975454506</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FISHERMAN yesterday revealed that he is seeking #1m damages from
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Skipper Nigel Johnston, from the West Highlands, was forced to sell
his boat, the Moyallon, and quit the sea after the Government outlawed
his conservation-conscious method of netting big fish close to the
seabed.
However, the type of nets he used, which the Scottish Office claimed
could be used to poach salmon, have been used legally in Scottish waters
by a fleet of around 40 larger foreign boats, whose catch is estimated
to be worth #50m per year.
Now, just two days before his fishermen's association was to challenge
the rules outlawing single-strand ''tangle'' nets in Scotland's highest
court, the Government has announced that it is doing a U-turn and
changing the rules.
Parliament is to be asked to allow precisely the kind of fishing
methods pioneered off Scotland by Mr Johnston, 40, of Arisaig, near
Mallaig, Inverness-shire.
Last December, the Northern Ireland-born fisherman was forced to sell
the 40ft Moyallon because he could not keep up repayments on his
Highlands and Islands Enterprise loan. He was forbidden to use his
10in-mesh tangle nets and was therefore unable to make a living.
The skipper's troubles started shortly after his boat was built in
Girvan, Ayrshire, with the help of a Government grant and aid from the
European Union, as well as his loan from the old Highland Development
Board.
In 1992, Mr Johnston had to bring his nets ashore to have them
repaired. They were confiscated at Mallaig harbour, while he was charged
with operating illegally. Although he won his case, the Crown
successfully appealed against the Fort William Sheriff Court decision.
The upshot was that he was forced to sell his boat . . . ironically to
a skipper in East Yorkshire who now uses exactly the same method of
fishing but perfectly legally.
The Mallaig and North West Fishermen's Association, which represents
more than 100 boats working off the West Highlands, worked hard to try
and avoid the forced sale and to get Mr Johnston back to sea.
Yesterday, the association's full-time secretary, Mr Hugh Allen, said:
''Nigel was the victim of an injustice and our fight for him involved a
matter of principle. There was no possibility of his type of nets ever
catching a salmon. We welcome the Government's change of heart but will
reserve our detailed comments until we see the how the proposed law
change is drafted.''
In its expensive battle, the association has crucially won the support
of the EU's Fisheries Commissioner, Emma Bonito, from Italy.
Mr Johnston, who has a two-year-old daughter, said: ''I have issued a
writ against Mr Forsyth. I want #1m to cover the cost of loss of the
boat, which will cost #350,000 to replace, the loss of earnings from
being forced out of business, and for the hurt and hassle that I have
been put though, for a law that was always utterly pointless.''

<TEXT>
SLAUGHTERMEN were warned last night they faced prosecution if they
failed to ensure that cattle offal did not get into the food chain.
Offal has been linked to the transfer of ''mad cow'' disease.
Representatives of owners were summoned to a meeting with Agriculture
Minister Douglas Hogg following evidence that some carcasses could be
leaving abattoirs without all the offal removed.
Under new Ministry of Agriculture regulations, slaughterhouses are
required to remove and destroy all specified bovine offals (SBOs),
including the brain, spinal chord, spleen, tonsils and intestines. These
are thought to be capable of carrying bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE).
However, a recent survey by the State Veterinary Service found four
cases where small pieces of offal had remained attached to the carcass.
These finds prompted last night's meeting.
Afterwards, Mr Hogg said he had warned the industry representatives
that the rules must be properly complied with or they could face court
action.
''I expressed my concern that a number of failings had been found in
the handling of specified bovine offals in slaughterhouses and reminded
them of the importance of the SBO controls for the protection of public
and animal health,'' he said.
''I said that I would only be satisfied with 100% compliance with the
rules and informed them that the Meat Hygiene Service would enforce the
controls most rigorously.
''Where sufficient evidence is available prosecutions will be taken
and prosecutions are already under consideration in some cases.''

AN EXECUTIVE member of Glasgow University's Student Representative
Council has been thrown off the body in what is thought to be the first
removal of its kind in the SRC's 110-year history.
Vice president in charge of welfare, Ms Tamsin Mayberry, was voted off
the SRC at a meeting last night for breaching the student body's
constitution by acting in an ''inappropriate manner''.
It is understood that Ms Mayberry, a third-year science student and
one of nine executives, faced allegations of printing out computer
information when she worked at the University Court Office during the
summer.
There was some dispute over whether or not the documents, thought to
contain information on the university nursery, were confidential.
Ms Mayberry, who was accompanied by a representative, declined to
comment but she is known to have apologised at the council meeting,
although at one stage threatened to walk out.
The talks were described as ''reasonable'' by one member. Around 20
people spoke on the ''motion of removal'', most criticising her actions
though some spoke in her defence.
A vote was then taken among the 65 representatives, and the required
two-thirds majority was reached.
The SRC president, Mr Alberto Costa, explained later that Ms Mayberry
had admitted accessing the material. When discovered by staff, she first
said it had been a mistake, claiming she was not familiar with the
computer system.
She then said Mr Costa had asked for the information but later
retracted that claim, admitting his had been ''the first name that came
into her head''. Ms Mayberry then took two weeks to admit her ''error''.
Mr Costa said he was saddened that the affair had resulted in the
''historic'' removal of an executive member. She could also have been
censured or suspended under SRC rules.
He said: ''At this moment I feel very upset and angry that this
situation has come about. It has caused great embarrassment to myself
and every other member of the SRC.
''Thankfully she had the decency to accept that she had done something
wrong and did not carry on using my name once she was questioned.
''Tamsin was a valued executive member but the constitutional
committee and the council felt she had made errors of judgement. It was
not necessarily about punishing her, but action had to be taken. I
deeply regret what has happened but we have acted in a professional
manner.
''I am relieved that it is over and we will now try to make sure that
it doesn't happen again.''
He said members would be examining the circumstances surrounding the
incident in more detail over the coming weeks.
Mr Costa said he hoped students seeking employment within the
university would not be prejudiced by the case.
There will now be a by-election to replace Ms Mayberry. It is not yet
clear if she will be able to stand in that contest or in next year's
annual elections.

to figures published yesterday. Scottish Office statistics show that 37
new cases were reported during the quarter, 31 of them male. Eleven are
believed to have been infected through drug injection, 16 from
homosexual sex, and seven from heterosexual sex.
The number of Aids cases in Scotland now stands at 717 -- 580 male and
137 female. The figures also show that 40 new HIV-positive cases were

FUTURE generations will not forgive today's crofters if they turn
their backs on the opportunities to control their own destinies offered
by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and by other recent developments.
This was the clear message from the first and current presidents of
the Scottish Crofters' Union at the 10th annual conference in
Newtonmore, with the rider that the decision must come from the
croftersand not be imposed from above.
Delegates were considering the future following the Secretary of
State's recent proposals to transfer the control of Scottish
Office-owned crofting estates to the local communities and his call to
private owners to follow.
The SCU's acting president, Rogart crofter Alistair MacIver, was
convinced that crofters should act: ''We are very conscious of the fact
that when we come to the questions of land ownership and use we have to
try to change the culture of 250 years of dependence on others for
decisions affecting the land on which we live and work.
''We are aware that there will be those who are fearful of change and
it is right that we exercise caution but that is not a reason for doing
nothing. We have, I believe, an opportunity not likely to be repeated,
to seize the initiative, to take responsibility for our future and,
perhaps more importantly, the future of those who come after us.
''They will not thank us if we fail to recognise and take advantage of
the tide of support which is flowing for crofters and crofting. Be
assured that if we are seen to be unable or unwilling to utilise this
tide of support, it will very quickly ebb and our chance will be lost,
perhaps for ever.''
Mr MacIver said Mr Forsyth had put the issue of land tenure back on
the agenda and the SCU had already met him and would be pursuing it with
him. The union welcomed any move to give local people more control of
their own lives.
However, he warned: ''At the same time, we must recognise that any
such moves must come from within the crofting community; history shows
all too well that solutions imposed from on high are likely to result in
failure.
''We do not seek short-term solutions. Our objective is to secure the
long-term sustainable development of crofting communities in the
Highlands and Islands.''
The SCU's first president, Dr Frank Rennie, who combines crofting on
Lewis with lecturing at Lews Castle College in Stornoway, went
further:''Never within the lifetime of anyone here today has Scottish
land reform been such a topical issue which such a range of diverse
organisations are genuinely keen to progress.
''Some unlikely allies are being won over and we should be gracious
enough and wise enough to appreciate the shifting times.''

<HEADLINE>Forsyth's plan for Strathmashie seen as threat to commission. Forestry union warns on takeover</HEADLINE>

A SCOTTISH forestry union representative has warned that the decision
to let the people of Laggan take over the 3500-acre Strathmashie Forest
could sound the death knell for the Forestry Commission.
The warning from Mr Kenny Murray came as a Liberal Democrat MP, the
SNP's land spokesman, leading Highland campaigners and most of the
Scottish Crofters' Union annual conference threw their support behind
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's plans to allow the forest to be run
as Britain's first community forest.
Mr Murray said that the Laggan handover would prove the ''thin end of
the wedge'' and force Forest Enterprise to sell off some of its prime
areas of woodland to maintain its disposals programme.
The creation of a forestry stand-alone agency following the
Government's Forestry Review means that Forest Enterprise must break
even -- forcing disposals, according to Mr Murray.
''In the long term it will mean forestry jobs being lost. If these
areas are to be handed over at a knock-down price to local communities,
then the Forest Enterprise part of the Forestry Commission must go
elsewhere to sell land in order to achieve the Government's pre-set
target of breaking even,'' he said.
''Whichever way this is looked at, this is back-door privatisation.
The land is still being handed out of the public's hands to the hands of
one or two people.
''The feedback we have had throughout the last few years and on the
forestry review group is that local communities want to have more
involvement in the decision-making process with the Forestry Commission,
but they want Forestry Commission expertise to remain there at hand for
local people to use.
''Forestry needs long-term planning and not a quick fix that looks
attractive on the outside. I hope that the Secretary of State will take
a fresh look at this,'' said Mr Murray.
Local sources yesterday suggested that Strathmashie Forest is worth
closer to #2m than the #750,000 being talked about by backers of the
forest handover.
It is also understood that Mr Forsyth's backing for the scheme is at
odds with the thinking of his Forestry Minister, Lord Lindsay, who only
two months ago ruled out such a change in ownership.
At the Scottish Crofters' Union conference yesterday, a director of
the John Muir Trust, Mr Andy Wightman, said: ''I would make one
particular appeal today that we support the Scottish Office in this and
I would invite all politicians to take this offer up. Because Michael
Forsyth, for all I disagree with his politics, is engaged in a
substantial fight with the Forestry Commission.''
Highland historian Dr James Hunter said: ''If somebody had said to me
six months ago that I would come to this conference and ask you to send
a message of support to Michael Forsyth, I would not have thought it
very likely. But I think it is imperative. Whatever one thinks of the
politics of this initiative, here for the first time in 70 years we have
a Secretary of State prepared to move sympathetically on some of the
issues on which we have been pressing for action.
''I do hope this union and the local authorities who have been
supporting the Laggan people, will give Mr Forsyth some support on this
issue because I think he needs it.''
Argyll and Bute Liberal Democrat MP Ray Michie also moved support. ''I
think it absolutely essential that we do give backing to the bold
Forsyth in trying to get more of the forest into the hands of the
community.''
Councillor Rob Gibson, the SNP's land spokesman, said he would also
support Mr Forsyth because: ''In this case Mr Forsyth has accepted there
has to be intervention by the Government on behalf of the local
community.''
A spokesman for the Forestry Commission, however, said last night: ''I
don't know where The Herald story came from but the Forestry Commission
has sought the views of Ministers and is currently preparing a range of
options for their consideration. At present we have to seek and accept
the highest offer on the open market. That is unless there is a special
conservation, recreational or amenity value. But Strathmashie does not
come into that category.''
He said that the commission had a long and active involvement in
projects to see how local communities could benefit more from its
forests.

A BAIL application by Brixton prison escapers and IRA terrorism
suspects Nessan Quinlivan and Pearse McCauley was rejected by the Irish
High Court yesterday.
The two men, the subject of extradition warrants from Scotland Yard,
made their application three days after release from jail under Dublin's
response to the peace in Northern Ireland.
Quinlivan, 30, from Limerick, and McCauley, who was 31 yesterday and
comes from Strabane, County Tyrone, were freed from Portlaoise top
security prison on Monday but re-arrested over the extradition
application within minutes.
The two are accused of escaping from Brixton in 1991 while awaiting
trial on conspiracy to murder and cause explosion charges.
Scotland Yard anti-terrorist officer Detective Superintendent William
Emmerton told the court yesterday that they faced jail sentences of up
to 25 years if convicted in Britain.
Mr Justice Frank Murphy said the decisive factor in his rejection of
the bail applications was the escape from Brixton.
He agreed that both men were allowed temporary freedom from prison in
the Irish Republic in the weeks before they were released on Monday and
that neither had attempted to abscond although they knew the extradition
warrants against them were pending.
Bail was opposed by Detective Superintendent John McElligot of the
Irish police on the grounds that he believed Quinlivan and McCauley
would not attend the extradition hearing if allowed to leave the court.
He said he based that belief on their escape from Brixton and the
gravity of the charges they faced.
Before being set free earlier this week, Quinlivan and McCauley were
both serving sentences for firearms offences in the Irish Republic.
They were arrested separately in Dublin and County Tipperary in 1993
and jailed for possessing guns.
Their releases brought to 36 the number of people freed by the Dublin
Government since the start of the terrorists' ceasefires in Northern
Ireland more than a year ago.
Fewer than 20 IRA prisoners now remain in Irish jails.
Around 30 anti-extradition protesters demonstrated outside the Irish
High Court yesterday while the bail applications were made.

A #10,000 scratchcard win by a 15-year-old boy is to be investigated
by police called in by National Lottery organisers Camelot last night.
Clayton Beech bought his #1 ticket on Friday from a local newsagent
and returned next day to collect the winnings with his mother Prudence.
Mrs Beech, who says she asked her son to buy her the ticket, was
referred to a post office where she collected the winnings.
However, her son, of Scholar Green, near Congleton, Cheshire, was a
year too young to play and, under lottery rules, should not have been
sold the scratchcard.
Camelot said it was satisfied that the shop had been misled when
selling the ticket to the boy and has told retailers to ask for proof of
age if they are in any doubt when selling tickets.
A Camelot spokeswoman said: ''We are passing this matter to the police
for investigation and will be co-operating fully with them.
''We are not planning to take any further action at this stage,
pending the outcome of the police investigation.''
The incident has brought renewed calls from the National Council on
Gambling for the legal age for buying tickets to be raised from 16 to
18.

A TAX-CUTTING agenda giving incentives to hard work and investment was
part of the Tories' ''exciting agenda'', the Prime Minister said
yesterday.
Mr Major also claimed he had no doubt that the Government will win a
fifth term in office, despite the Labour lead in the opinion polls.
His optimism was revealed in an interview for the New Zealand Herald
during the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Auckland.
Mr Major said: ''There is only one poll that matters, the General
Election itself. And I'm in no doubt that at that election we will win
on our record and our policies for the future.''
He said that the Government's reforms to schools, hospitals and public
services had given taxpayers the choice they needed and the quality of
public services they deserved.
''We can only have top-class public services if we have a prosperous
economy.
''That's why I want to turn Britain into the unrivalled enterprise
centre of Europe.
''To do that we need to cut taxes as soon as we can safely do so, to
give people the incentive to work hard and to invest in our future.
''We will need to cut red tape, so that Government does not burden
business with unnecessary bureaucracy. And we need to ensure that every
child gets the best education possible, so that the workforce of the
future has the skills required in tomorrow's world.''
Mr Major said it was an exciting agenda that built on the Government's
achievements and laid the foundation for future growth and prosperity.
Only the Conservatives could offer that agenda and he was in no doubt
the British public would realise that and, come polling day, would vote
Conservative.

AN alcohol addiction specialist sacked by the Dumbarton Area Council
on Alcohol has received #10,000 in settlement of her unfair dismissal
claim.
Mrs Ingrid Curran, 45, of Glenpark Road, Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, is
also to be provided with a reference and a statement regarding her
dismissal.
The terms of the statement are to be agreed between the
representatives of both sides and disclosed to the Acas conciliation
officer.
The sacking sparked anger in the Dumbarton community, with members
threatening to boycott the Area Council on Alcohol, based at West
Bridgend Lodge, Dumbarton.
A petition protesting at the way she was treated was also presented to
committee members.
It was alleged that she had been dismissed instantly after a letter of
complaint had been written about her.
At the time of her sacking, Mrs Curran said her professional
reputation was in tatters after seven years as co-ordinator and nine
years as a counsellor with Dumbarton Area Council on Alochol.
Before an industrial tribunal hearing of her case got under way, the
council agreed to pay a cash sum of #10,000 in full and final settlement
of her complaint relating to her dismissal.

A PRO-cannabis campaigner last night described the Rosalind Henderson
court ruling as both unfortunate and a waste of taxpayers' money.
It coincided with a request by the Legalise Cannabis Campaign to
Scotland's 72 MPs for their views on the role of cannabis in society.
The body's spokesperson, Ms Linda Hendry, said of the court case: ''It
was not suggested she had been selling the drug.
''She needed it out of medical necessity for two complaints, being
both arthritic and partially sighted.
''I think it is very unfortunate but in the original trial she did not
bring in this medical necessity and it could therefore not really come
into the appeal hearing.
''It is, however, a waste of taxpayers' money that she is being locked
up.''
Ms Hendry, a mother-of-three who runs a weaving business and also acts
as a childminder, said international law was designed to stop
trafficking in cannabis.
However, she claimed Britain was behind the times by not allowing
people to grow a few plants in their own home.
The campaigners want to open up the cannabis debate and have
identified four possible options for change which could be introduced
quickly as pilot schemes.
''We wish to solicit opinions to determine which options, if any, are
the most appropriate for Scotland,'' Ms Hendry said.
The campaigners realised that most MPs would probably ignore the
request for comments. They had also written to MEPs, drug workers, chief
constables, and drug education chiefs.
The options are: the decriminalisation of possession of small
quantities of the drug; making tincture of cannabis available on
prescription; allowing growth of cannabis plants without licence as long
as an individual did not sell the drug; and permitting the sale of
cannabis in licensed members-only clubs.
Society was split, the campaign claims, between moralists who believed
the drug was evil and destroying society, and drug users who believed
cannabis to be a safe recreational and therapeutic drug.
On option one, both police and courts time would be saved and
resources freed to tackle serious crime.
Option two would see savings in health service budgets as cannabis
replaced expensive synthentic drugs.
Option three was similar to the situation where individuals produced
their own tobacco or alcohol. Here, the campaign said jobs would be
created in the horticultural industry. Also, young people would be
unlikely to have the patience, resources or specialist knowledge to grow
their own cannabis.
Under the fourth and final option, supply of the drug would be
regulated to ensure a pure supply whilst revenue was raised for the
Government. Since proof of age would be a requirement for membership,
minors would be unable to join and obtain cannabis. Also, any link with
hard drugs would be broken.
LCC hopes to convince various interested parties of the strength of
feeling and size of the pro-cannabis vote in the run up to the General
Election.

A TENANT of pop legend Sir Cliff Richard is to quit a country cottage
after being arrested on drugs charges yesterday.
Police are believed to have netted a large haul of cannabis plants in
a raid on the property.
Sir Cliff's business manager, Malcolm Smith, last night denied reports
that tenant Clive Williamson was being evicted from the cottage near
Snowdon, North Wales.
Detectives swooped on Mr Williamson's home, one of two adjoining
cottages owned by the singer on the outskirts of the village of
Dolwyddela, Gwynedd, at 3am on October 12.
Mr Williamson will face Llandudno Magistrates on November 22 charged
with six offences, including possession of cannabis with intent to
supply and the production of cannabis, police said.
However, officers say they have no plans to interview Sir Cliff, who
occasionally stays at the other cottage but has not visited it in more
than four years and has never met Mr Williamson.
He is currently touring Germany to promote his new album and knew
nothing of the drug squad raid.
Sir Cliff bought the double-fronted, L-shaped property many years ago.
There were reports yesterday that Mr Williamson was being evicted but
Sir Cliff's business manager Malcolm Smith said last night: ''The tenant
has told me he is planning to leave the cottage but he has not been
evicted. That is far from the truth.''

Rosalind Henderson speaks exclusively to Kirsty Scott about her life
after the police raid
HE'S now a minister, the man who first introduced Rosalind Henderson
to cannabis back in the 1970s. She was in her twenties and needed
something to relax her after a bad car smash, which had left her with
serious leg injuries and the use of only one eye.
Cannabis fitted the bill; she liked the way it made her feel, the way
it smoothed the edges. Seventeen years later that initial joint had
developed into a small personal indulgence.
It has seen her through the births of her three children and
eventually brought 25 policemen and a sniffer dog through the unlocked
door of her rural Perthshire home.
It is one of the blisteringly hot days of mid-summer and Rosalind is
lying out under a faded cloth umbrella on the front lawn of her home at
Brae of Monzie.
This is a completely secluded spot and that, more than anything else,
is what has shaken Mrs Henderson's faith in human nature after the
police burst in on the morning of May 31 last year. Someone, clearly
someone who had at some time made the long trek up the pitted, winding
track to their house, had tipped off the authorities.
From the outset, Mrs Henderson says, it was clear the police were
expecting to uncover a major operation and had even given the raid a
codename: Operation Justice.
The justice probably refers to Mrs Henderson's husband, Keith, a
prominent advocate, and she says she suspects the police thought they
were about to smash a major drugs operation, with links to the heart of
Scotland's legal establishment.
What they found in a small back bedroom were 13 mature cannabis plants
being grown under powerful horticultural lamps, 48 grammes of dried
cannabis leaves, and a propagating tray with scores of cannabis
seedlings. Mrs Henderson had been cultivating them for five months, the
first time, she says, she had tried growing her own.
They searched the rest of the house, keeping a Rizla paper with the
number of a bra company executive on it, and a sheaf of other documents.
It was her husband who bore the brunt of the Brae of Monzie raid,
being taken off to prison. However, he was later to be acquitted.
Mrs Henderson was on holiday in Rhodes and learned that the family's
lives had been turned upside down when she called her mother.
Shielding her eyes from the sun, Mrs Henderson lights up the first of
several cigarettes and stares out over the hills. ''She told me I would
be arrested when I arrived at Glasgow Airport and sure enough I was.''
Forewarned, Mrs Henderson was last off the plane and approached the
officers who were waiting for her. She was taken to Paisley police
station and then driven ''at 100 mph'' to Perth police station where she
was processed and sent to Cornton Vale women's prison.
She says that she finds it ironic that she was being taken into
custody for something she was doing in the privacy of her own home, and
was driven there by the police at 30mph more than the legal speed limit.
She was in Cornton Vale for six days.
Because she is an advocate's wife, the story had the necessary frisson
to propel it into the headlines, and she believes firmly that she was
made a scapegoat because of the connection.
However, she gets furious that people may have thought her husband was
involved. The cannabis was hers and hers alone, she says, and he had
nothing to do with it.
She's also frustrated at the ''idle rich'' nuances applied to her
case. The Brae of Monzie house is rented, ramshackle, and spartan and
the children, educated privately, are on an assisted-places scheme.
She was portrayed as the member of local Bible study group, who amused
herself making dried flower arrangements for the tweedy clients of
Edinburgh's department store Jenners.
In fact she joined the study group as a means of discussing faith. She
considers herself a deeply spiritual person with a high degree of
tolerance for the beliefs of others.
The dried flower arranging was actually a small business called
Caledonian Roots, which sold thick lumps of Caldeonian pine she found at
the back of the house and cleaned and varnished as decorations or
centrepieces.
When they realised they weren't dealing with your average Perthshire
matron, many of the chatterati turned on the fact that there were three
children in the house where the cannabis was being cultivated.
While she admits that the events of the past year have left the
children, aged 10, 14, and 15, bewildered, she insists that only the
eldest knew of the plants' existence.
In fact, it was cannabis that helped with the delivery of all three
children. ''I took it when I had my children and it was the only thing I
had, no drugs and no gas and air, and it worked out very well.''
It may have eased their entry into the world but the arrests and
jailing of both parents were deeply traumatic.
''I think it frightened them initially, but this time round it was not
as bad. Initially it had quite an effect on them. We spent the rest of
the year just trying to keep them together and sort it out.
''They're all right now. I was more upset than they were. I lost a lot
of weight last year. I wasn't very well, what with the stress. Just
crying a lot. Keith couldn't work in any responsible job because he was
awaiting trial in the High Court.
''He would not even be taken on as a shop assistant. We were stuck on
income support for a year.''
She does regret the impact on her family but not the cannabis use
itself. She was quite clear in court that she thought the drug should be
decriminalised and she's holding to that.
''I still feel the way I feel. I have not changed my mind about it . .
. I have had a lot of support, an awful lot and nothing adverse. People
have been very supportive, I think because the sentence was so
outrageous.''
She was contacted by the Legalise Cannabis movement while she was in
Cornton Vale, but is still not sure if she will become publicly involved
in the debate.
''I don't know. I don't know how I can help. If I thought it would do
any good I would go around Scotland getting up a petition . . . I really
do think it will be legalised one day.
''It seems to me they could make revenue from it. I think it's totally
hypocritical to allow people to go to the pub on Friday, Saturday and
every other day of the week and take a great whopping percentage in
tax.''
''I still feel the way I feel. I have not changed my mind about it.''

<HEADLINE>Labour bids to sell devolution to business community</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>BENEDICT BROGAN, POLITICAL REPORTER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
ONE of Labour's senior economic spokesman today will warn Scotland's
business community to stop complaining behind closed doors and start
explaining openly its fears of devolution.
In a tough speech before some of the country's leading businessmen, Mr
Alistair Darling will seek to reassure them that Labour's devolution
plans will boost the Scottish economy while keeping Scotland firmly in
the Union.
However, he also will tell them that business and industry have a role
to play in the debate. ''If you want politicians to understand your
business, then you have to tell them what you think,'' he will say.
His speech to the Walpole Committee in Glasgow marks the beginning of
a determined campaign by Labour designed to sell devolution to one of
its potentially harshest critics.
Labour's plans for a devolved parliament with tax-raising powers have
already led some industrialists to warn that it could frighten off
inward investment.
Mr Darling, Labour's City spokesman, will argue that a Scottish
parliament would give business a competitive edge in the British and
European single markets, while keeping Scotland within the United
Kingdom.
He will say: ''I believe that would be attractive to business because
business would be closer to government here in Scotland.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, who already has begun the
work of selling constitutional reform to industry, was consulted on the
speech, the first on the future of the Scottish economy since the
publication last month of the Constitutional Convention's proposals.
Mr Robertson will be closely involved in the campaign, which is due to
receive encouragement next month when Labour leader Tony Blair picks up
the theme during a visit to Scotland.
What is already being labelled ''the mission to explain'' was
described last night by Mr Darling as an attempt to counter ''Tory
scaremongering.''
He said: ''When you start to explain what you are, people realise that
the nonsense and scaremongering that Michael Forsyth is involved in has
nothing to do with reality and everything to do with reviving the
fortunes of the Government.''
Mr Darling said that the business community often complained that it
was misunderstood by politicians, yet failed to realise that politicians
merely reflected their constituents. ''Scottish business needs to do
more to explain its successes and its problems to the Scottish
population as a whole.''
In his speech, he will say: ''Stop anyone in the street and ask them
about Scottish industry, and the chances are they will recall the
shipyards of the Clyde, the coal mines of the Central Belt and the
steel-making in Motherwell. For many, Scottish industry is a heritage
trail.''
New high-technology industries and finance houses were not as visible
as Ravenscraig or John Brown's Shipbuilders. ''We need to do more to
educate the public and in that process, add to the sum of the knowledge
of politicians.''
Senior officials in Scottish Enterprise and CBI Scotland already have
warned of business unease at the prospect of a tax-raising assembly.
Mr Darling said last night: ''I know they've got concerns. If they do
have a message they should shout it from the rooftops, as opposed to
complaining about it behind closed doors.''
Mr Darling will tell his audience, which is due to include Mr Scott
Greer, head of Loganair, and Mr George Bennett, General Manager of
Motorola, that devolution involves no risks for the Scottish economy and
will leave the fundamentals of macro-economic policy in the hands of
Westminster.
''Because we believe in the British single market, let me make it
clear that there will be no separate corporate tax system, no separate
regulatory system. Matters relating to macro-economic policy, general
taxation, the functions discharged by the DTI, Department of Social
Security and foreign affairs, will all remain matters for the
Westminster Parliament.
''And we will continue to send 72 MPs there. We are not leaving
Britain. We are very much of it. We have a lot to contribute to Britain
and let's make no apology for it.
''The Scottish parliament will have the power to vary the basic rate
of income tax by 3p up or down. This is a power I am certain will not be
used without a great deal of prudence and caution,'' he will say.
WOMEN have an important role to play in the Scottish economy, Liberal
Democrat MP Charles Kennedy said yesterday, (writes Lynne Robertson).
Speaking in Edinburgh at the annual general meeting of the Scots
charity Training 2000 -- which promotes the training and development of
women -- the MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye said: ''If Scotland's
economy is to thrive into the next century we have to make the best use
of all our talents -- and that has to mean better harnessing the skills
of women.''

UNIONS representing the 5000 employees at the Rosyth and Devonport
royal naval dockyards yesterday called for an independent public inquiry
into the allocation of Trident submarine refit contracts, following the
disclosure that Devonport's #236m bid is unlikely to cover half the
costs of upgrading the Plymouth yard.
They have approached the National Audit Office and the House of
Commons Public Accounts Committee, urging inquiries, and challenged
former Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and his successor, Mr Michael
Portillo, to disclose all documents on the Devonport bid ''fiasco'',
which almost led to the closure of Rosyth, and give public evidence.
Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' and chairman of the dockyard union negotiators, said yesterday
that Devonport's private managers could not escape blame, although they
were also being ''fitted up by a guilty Government desparately seeking
an alibi''.
This time, the Government could not escape responsibility for a fiasco
that would cost both the taxpayer and the Navy dear.
Mr Dromey called on Mr Rifkind to admit he was warned in the summer of
1994 that the costs of the Devonport Trident complex (D154) were
escalating out of control. He challenged Mr Portillo to admit that he
had been told that the true costs of D154 would be at least double the
#236m winning bid from Devopnport managers DML.
The unions also wanted to know whether the extra funds would be met by
the taxpayer or through reduced Navy expenditure elsewhere.
Because of this delay, they expected the Government to reallocate to
Rosyth at least two additional nuclear submarine refits and between four
and six of Rosyth's surface fleet refit programme to be diverted to
Devonport.
However, the unions are particularly anxious that the Devonport
overspend problems should not reopen the previous threat to Rosyth's
future as the Ministry of Defence had made it clear to them that they
would proceed with D154 regardless.

managers, farmers and council workers.
Asked if this new part of the Government's War on Waste initiative
would result in job losses, he said: ''It's a question of

overall responsibility for the election manifesto and a strategic
overview of the party's parliamentary teams. Mr Alex Carlile, MP for
Montgomery, takes over most of Mr Beith's home affairs portfolio, while
Mr Beith retains responsibility for police, prison and security matters.
Mr Simon Hughes, the MP for Southwark and Bermondsey, moves from
education to health, while Mr Don Foster, MP for Bath, is promoted to
take charge of the education, housing and local government team. Mr
David Chidgey, victor of the Eastleigh by-election, takes over

GOVERNMENT Ministers must get themselves out of the Whitehall system
to set a new political agenda, Mr Hugh Colver claimed last night after
his sudden resignation as director of communications at Tory Central
Office.
Mr Colver, 50, who spent many years as a Whitehall civil servant, told
me: ''I have no doubt that on the face of it some of the things I have
said will not go down too well in the Tory Party.
''But there will be people in Central Office who recognise the truth.
Ministers have got to get themselves out of the bureaucratic system and
its way of thinking after so many years in government and start thinking
about setting a political agenda for a General Election.''
Mr Colver resigned because he believes that the Tories have not yet
wakened up to the fact that they face a survival General Election within
18 months, and probably next autumn.
He was hired six months ago before the new, abrasive Tory Party
chairman, Dr Brian Mawhinney, was appointed after Mr Major's leadership
election last summer.
He left Central Office without confronting Dr Mawhinney with his
doubts about the direction of the Tory Party, but he left without any
rows with the new party chairman, who has expressed his surprise on Mr
Colver's resignation.
His going highlights the Tory dilemma, not yet resolved -- how to
handle the new Tony Blair Labour Party.
Mr Colver's doubts are reflected by others in Whitehall whose job it
is to protect the Government's image. The key criticism is that
Ministers are not yet fighting for survival. Momentum has been lost
since Mr Major's re-election as leader.
Ministers counter that the new session of Parliament next week and the
Budget with their new programme of legislation will fill this vacuum.
However, Mr Colver did not have the stomach for the tough political
battle to come, involving more propaganda than rational argument.
Labour last night was quick to spot the damaging doubts that Mr Colver
cited yesterday in a series of broadcasts.
Its Treasury spokesman, Mr Andrew Smith, claimed: ''The Government has
no clear or coherent message. Ministers have no sense of direction. And
the Tory Party has lost faith in itself. No-one has the first idea how
to combat a new revitalised Labour Party. No wonder Hugh Colver walked
out.''
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister said yesterday that a tax-cutting agenda
giving incentives to hard work and investment was part of the Tories'
''exciting agenda'', the Prime Minister said yesterday.
In an interview for the New Zealand Herald during the Commonwealth
Heads of Government meeting in Auckland, Mr Major claimed he had no
doubt that the Government would win a fifth term in office, despite the
Labour lead in the opinion polls.
* Last night, Tory MP David Shaw (Dover) criticised Mr Colver, saying
he had no right to turn on his employers.
''Someone leaving such a job should have the trust of his employer and
not be bleating to the press at the first opportunity,'' he said.

restricting their outside earnings.
Following their meeting, Lord Nolan said the committee had decided to
wait for 12 months before carrying out the review, originally due this

He said the committee welcomed the Commons decision to require MPs to

TRUSTS, boards and opted-out schools would take the place of
democratic local government if Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth got
his way in the long term, a council leader claimed yesterday.
Councillor Keith Geddes, Labour vice-president of the Convention of
Scottish Local Authorities, warned that a Tory win at the next General
Election would mean more powers being taken to the centre and the
wholesale privatisation of any remaining local government services.
Taking part in a debate sponsored by The Herald at the annual
conference of the Society of Directors of Personnel in St Andrews,
Councillor Geddes claimed that current attacks by Ministers on councils
were designed to divert attention away from the fact that the council
tax would increase significantly next year as a result of cuts in
central government grant.
Councillor Geddes, who is the leader of the new City of Edinburgh
Council, was speaking on the eve of a pre-Budget meeting today in
Edinburgh between Cosla leaders and the Scottish Secretary to discuss
the grave financial problems councillors claim they face.
Councillor Brian Meek, chairman of the opposition Tory group in
Edinburgh, said the new one-tier system was here to stay and he
predicted no political party would ever return to the old region and
district arrangements.
He personally favoured the removal of Government capping powers over
council budgets and wanted to create a situation where councils could
raise more of their own finances.
In a letter to Mr Forsyth yesterday, Cosla president Rosemary McKenna
confirmed the Convention's committment to see capping ended.

ANGRY ex-servicemen in Scotland discovered yesterday that Royal
British Legion scratchcards were being sold north of the Border with all
the proceeds going to England.
A row broke out after senior Scottish members were asked to buy the
cards and discovered the scheme was organised by the English branch of
the Legion, which is not attached to the Scottish organisation.
Mr Alex Drummond, Glasgow area president of The Royal British Legion
Scotland, said his members were very unhappy about it.
The Earl Haig Fund in Edinburgh said they had received angry calls
from around Scotland and had made an official complaint to the British
Legion in London. ''We are currently in talks with London about getting
a percentage of takings for Scotland but there is no decision on that.''
A spokesman for the British Legion in London said the distributors of
the scratchcards had ''slipped over the Border without us being
warned''.

THE Scottish Office is seeking to abolish solicitors' monopoly over
conveyancing and wills. For the second time in five years, it is trying
to establish a regulatory body for new practitioners in these areas.
The Scottish Conveyancing and Executry Board, originally set up in
1990, was suspended in 1992 because of poor demand in the housing market
and problems in arranging adequate consumer protection at reasonable
cost. That two-year suspension was renewed last year.
Home Affairs Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said: ''The time is
now right to abolish the monopoly which the solicitor profession has at
present over elements of conveyancing and executry services and thus to
provide the customer with the benefit of increased competition and
choice.''
He said he expected the board to open for business by autumn next year
to register the first entrants to the new professions.
The day before the Scottish Office suspended the board three years
ago, the first batch of students had started on courses to become
licensed conveyancers. They graduated from Abertay University, Dundee,
this year with no jobs to go to.
Reaction to the announcement last night was split.
Hamilton estate agent May Storrie, president of the National
Association of Estate Agents, which campaigned for the change, said it
was an important decision which would give Scots the same opportunities
as those enjoyed in England and Wales.
''The solicitors' monopoly stands directly in the way of free
competition and consumer choice and will bring real benefits to
homeowners in Scotland,'' she said.
Mr Roy Slater, managing director of the Roy Slater Estate Agents
Group, said: ''I am very surprised but nevertheless delighted. It is a
very brave and bold move on the Conservatives' part and it comes as a
breath of fresh air.''
However, the Law Society of Scotland said the decision was unjustified
and did not make economic sense. President Alan Boyd said the society
had provided help and guidance when the board was set up and understood
the reasons for its suspension because of the sluggish property market.
''That situation has not changed. The housing market is still in the
doldrums,'' he said.
Solicitors' property centres in Glasgow and Edinburgh said the use of
the term ''monopoly'' was misleading since they represented more than
400 different firms, each with their own fees and rules.
GSPC director Michael Graham said: ''We have to be deeply concerned
that the consumer is properly protected under any new regime. This
announcement of a reinstatement of the board was unnecessary, will do
nothing for the housing market, and will undoubtedly surprise many.''
ESPC chairman George Clark said the board would yield nothing in
quality terms for the consumer. It was essential that new practitioners
were backed by full professional indemnity and contributed to a
guarantee fund, as was the case for solicitors.
''Anything else might seriously threaten to undermine Scotland's
accepted edge over others in terms of its legal system relating to
property,'' he added.
However, Mr David Alves, chairman of Registered Estate Agents Ltd
(REAL) said the move was long overdue.
''It has long been suspected there have been very powerful forces in
delaying the change until now. As estate agents now handle half of all
residential property sales in Scotland, we hope Lord James will review
the composition of the board and include at least one Scottish estate
agent among its members,'' he said.

GLASGOW City Vision -- a steering group involving opinion formers from
the private and public sectors -- is to ask the people of Glasgow how
the city should develop in the twenty-first century.
Citizens will be asked to help build frameworks for improvements over
the next 20 years in the categories of living, working, learning, and
playing in Glasgow.
Councillor Pat Lally, leader of the city council, said: ''I have
always been convinced that if a city is not on an upward trend, it will
be overtaken by its competitors. It is the determination to maintain
progress which makes city life fundamentally exciting and dynamic.
''No-one would deny over the past 15 years, Glasgow has been on an
upswing. During that time, the city has been transformed, even reborn.
''To sustain the positive trend, we now need to concentrate on the
challenge of the future. We will be most successful if we have a star to
follow in the form of a set of shared aspirations for our citizens, our
institutions and businesses. We must have a clear idea of the role of
the city within the UK, Scotland, and the region.''
Launching the consultative document, Councillor Lally referred to
Glasgow's past achievements -- civic achievements such as the Loch
Katrine water supply, the Glasgow municipal electric company, and an
advanced social and medical infrastructure.
More recent successes included the Miles Better campaign, the 1988
International Garden Festival, the 1990 European City of Culture, and
the award of 1999 UK City of Architecture and Design.
''These achievements -- new and old -- were made possible by the
breadth and depth of the various inputs for a common cause. This
consultative document asks the questions; we need your responses to help
shape those aspirations, and to keep the city on its upward curve into
the 21st century,''  he said.

A MAN who won a landmark damages case in September against Strathclyde
Police following a racist attack in 1991 by a constable is considering a
private prosecution against the officer, he announced yesterday.
Mr Aamer Anwar, 27, was speaking at a civil liberties press conference
to call for an independent police complaints commission in Scotland
after it emerged that the officer involved in the attack returned to
duty after being suspended for six weeks.
Mr Anwar was awarded #4200 compensation at Glasgow Sheriff court after
suing the chief constable in Scotland's first civil action alleging a
racist attack by an officer. This came after his formal complaint to the
police failed.
The ruling found that Constable Graham McKee, 35, had deliberately
assaulted Mr Anwar, a Glasgow University student activist at the time,
by slamming his face against the ground. He had chased Mr Anwar after
catching him bill-posting.
Sheriff Evans said that, during the attack, Mr McKee remarked: ''This
is what happens to black boys with big mouths.''
The officer was suspended on September 21 directly after the ruling
and returned to duty on October 30 after the prosecuting authorities
decided against further action.
In a statement yesterday, Strathclyde Police said: ''The
procurator-fiscal has since intimated that he is to take no proceedings.
The 35-year-old officer concerned has since been returned to duty and
the matter rests with the deputy chief constable.''
Mr Anwar said: ''My life has been made a misery and now when finally
the court finds in my favour the force closes ranks to protect one of
their own.''
Mr Anwar's solicitor confirmed that a private prosecution against Mr
McKee was under consideration. It would be only the third such case in
Scotland this century.

THE Queen Mother, supporting herself with two sticks, laid a cross on
a plinth in memory of Britain's war dead yesterday. It was her first
major public appearance since the summer.
She also used a golf buggy for a ''ride-about'' along a line of war
veterans.
The 95-year-old Queen Mother was determined to attend the annual Field
of Remembrance service outside St Margaret's Church, Westminster, which
she missed last year for the first time since the Second World War
because of a leg injury.
At times leaning heavily on the sticks, she still managed to smile at
those greeting her and walked nearly 100ft to the spot, near Westminster
Abbey, where the open-air service was held.
A row over a gay rights group's bid to pay tribute to gay men and
lesbians who had died during the Second World War threatened to cast a
shadow over yesterday's ceremony. The Royal British Legion accused
Outrage! of ''bad taste'' in trying to hijack Remembrance Sunday for
political ends.
Campaigner Peter Tatchell said the group had renamed this Sunday Queer
Remembrance Day.
A pink triangle would be laid at the Cenotaph in Whitehall by a
72-year-old Jewish lesbian who fled Germany in 1939 and whose uncle died
in a concentration camp after being arrested by the Gestapo in a gay
cabaret club.
But legion spokesman Jeremy Lillies said: ''As far as we are concerned
it is in extremely bad taste to make what is effectively a political
point at a time of remembrance, which is above politics, and
particularly at the memorial to those people who made it possible for
them to enjoy the freedoms they now enjoy.''
Mr Tatchell said around 500,000 gay men, lesbians and bisexuals had
served in the British armed forces in the Second World War.
Yesterday, several thousand ex-servicemen and women watched as the
Queen Mother laid her own personal small wooden cross, bearing a poppy,
on a 6ft cross-shaped plinth covered with the red flowers -- symbol of
remembrance since the First World War.
The Duke of York helped her make sure her cross was in the right
place. Moments before, the Queen Mother had stood erect and still during
a short service and two-minute silence.
She listened as Mrs Sarah Jones, widow of Falkland's hero Colonel 'H'
Jones, read the traditional words: ''They will not grow old as we that
are left grow old.''
Then the golf buggy was drawn up, bearing two large poppies on the
front. The Queen Mother got inside and drove along the line of veterans,
talking to them as she went.
A Royal British Legion spokesman said: ''We couldn't be certain that
the Queen Mother was coming right up until this morning, but we knew
this is one point in her calendar that she would never willingly miss.''
No announcement has yet been made on whether the Queen Mother will
join other members of the royal family at the Cenotaph on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Duke of York has backed a campaign to restore the
two-minute silence on Armistice Day.
''Fifty years is a long time; time to forget the horrors and
sacrifices of war. By taking the time to reflect it may, just may, be
the way to prolong peace,'' he said in response to a letter from legion
president Vice Admiral Sir Geoffrey Dalton.
Prince Andrew said: ''Today a great number of people have no
recollection of war and its consequences, but after 50 years of peace we
should not allow ourselves to become complacent.
''Should anyone wish to observe a two-minute silent reflection at the
eleventh hour on the eleventh day of the eleventh month they may,
perhaps, begin to understand the meaning of service, loyalty and freedom
which can, all too easily, be taken for granted.''

Alan MacDermid looks at the health effects of the drug
CONTROVERSY over cannabis is centred on the social effects of people
being ''stoned'' and the question of whether it causes cancer or
long-term brain damage.
In spite of the uncertainties Dr Iain Smith, a consultant psychiatrist
who treats people with drug problems at Gartnavel Royal Hospital in
Glasgow, is not in favour of it being legalised.
''From my point of view it is not a harmless drug -- possibly not as
harmful as alcohol or tobacco, but that isn't much of a
recommendation,'' he said.
''I see people who can't stop it, and they view it as a problem. They
are dependent on cannabis. They can't give it up. And they spend a lot
of money on it -- sometimes #15-#30 a week.
Trying to come off results in anxiety, irritability and insomnia,
although patients don't get the shakes characteristic of alcohol or
opiate withdrawal.
Dr Smith will often prescribe minor tranquilisers to bring them off,
and perhaps bring them into hospital.
''They are mainly young people,'' he pointed out. Drug use among young
people is becoming commonplace. It is pernicious.
''I am not sure it leads on to harder drugs, although most people I
see who have a heroin habit also have a cannabis habit. But I have
people whose problem is cannabis.
''I believe it is a biochemical addiction, though it doesn't happen as
often as with heroin, for example. It is physical in the sense that the
mind is physical, and you are altering your brain biochemistry with it.
''There has been debate in the scientific literature as to whether it
causes brain damage. Brain atrophy has been disputed or disproved, but
it has been blamed for something called amotivational syndrome, and is
supposed to be carcinogenic.''
Psychosis caused by cannabis is quite rare, said Dr Smith. But there
does seem to be wide consensus that where someone has an underlying
psychosis, cannabis may bring this to the surface.
Certainly the risk of death directly from consuming cannabis is
slight, but the social risks -- from driving for example -- apply as
they do to drink and it is much harder to detect in any relevant way.
He describes a test involving an airline pilot who took one or two
joints, and waited for eight hours before being put on a flight
simulator. His performance was markedly impaired.
''It is being commonly used within our society. If it was being made
even more widely available we would have more problems, and more
problems controlling it.''

EIGHT French naval vessels were set to sail up the Thames to London
early this morning, provoking outrage among environmentalists opposed to
France's nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
Greenpeace refused to say what action they would be taking in
connection with the visit while the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament is
to fly anti-nuclear banners from the dockside to ''welcome'' the ships.
CND spokesman Eddie Goncalves said: ''It will be the start of a
package of protests over the next week keeping the pressure up on the
French nuclear issue.''
Naval ships regularly make goodwill visits to friendly ports but
Scotland Yard has never had to deal with such a large party at such a
sensitive time and police are preparing for serious protests.
The ships, escorted by river police, were due to moor at West India
Dock from 3am.
None is nuclear-powered or nuclear weapons-capable but the welcome
extended to them at a time when France's nuclear tests are attracting
worldwide criticism has outraged protesters.
Greenpeace spokeswoman Kate Johnston said: ''Our feeling is that for
Britain to welcome any French military vessel at this time is a slap in
the face for the British public.''
She added: ''We think it is a pretty disgusting insult.''
Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark said: ''It is an inopportune
moment for the British Government to have invited French warships to
visit London. I think this is very insensitive indeed.''
Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said: ''In the
history of goodwill visits, this must be the worst-timed ever.''
''
The visit was described by sources at the Ministry of Defence and the
French Embassy as part of a routine training cruise during which
national service reserve officers will learn how to berth in ports.

MORE than half of British workers shrug off flu and continue to go in
to work, a survey has revealed.
Only 7% of those taking part in the poll said they would take time off
for a cold.
While 41% would stay at home with flu, the rest would carry on
regardless.
Not letting colleagues down and a sense of loyalty and duty were given
as the main reasons for ignoring illness. But for some, fear of the boss
was the overriding consideration.
The nationwide survey, on behalf of makers of a cold remedy, showed
that Scots were least likely to go to bed or call the doctor. The Welsh
were most likely to take time off.

<HEADLINE>Sell-off of BR leasing companies will raise #750m more than City observers anticipated. Runaway prices for rolling stock</HEADLINE>

THE Government will raise as much as #1800m from the sale of the three
passenger rolling-stock leasing companies which run British Rail's
11,000 locomotive and passenger fleet.
If the #800m to be paid in cash as dividends by the companies is
included, the sum rises above #2500m. This is about #750m more than had
been expected in the City and provides a much-needed boost to public
finances.
Announcing the terms yesterday, Transport Secretary Sir George Young
said it was Britain's largest-yet privatisation by direct sale.
However, the announcement of the deal, a major step in the
Government's increasingly controversial railway privatisation programme
and expected to be completed next month, brought immediate bitter
criticism from both Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
The three rolling-stock companies (Roscos) had been put up for auction
on a worldwide basis handled by Hambros merchant bank. In the event, two
of the companies sold, Eversholt Leasing and Porterbrook Leasing, have
gone to management teams backed by venture capital for #580m and #527m
respectively.
Backers for Eversholt include Cadover Partners, Electra Fleming,
Gartmore, and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Porterbook purchase is
financed by Charterhouse Development.
The third company, Angel Train Contracts, which is the biggest, has
been bought for #672.5m by a consortium made up of the US leasing group
Babcock &amp; Brown, the Japanese bank Nomura International, and Prideaux
and Associates. Dr Prideaux, who will be chairman, is a former managing
director of InterCity.
Sir George said the sale of the three companies attracted substantial
interest from international institutions from all major capital markets
in the UK, US, and Japan. He claimed it was clear that the Government's
plans for renewal of the country's rail industry were drawing wide
support from the business community.
The three Roscos will rent trains to the 25 rail service operators and
will be responsible for periodic heavy maintenance and overhauls.
Average age of the vehicles is 17 years and leasing contracts with the
train operators last an average of seven to nine years.
''The purchasers are demonstrating a strong commitment to the
development of a competitive market for passenger rolling stock. In
addition to taking over the existing train fleet and the Networker
Express currently on order, the new owners bring access to additional
funds to finance new trains and refurbish existing rolling stock,'' said
the Trade Secretary.
He claimed that leasing arrangements that had revolutionised airlines
would do the same for the railways.
Sir George said he hoped very much there would be new orders for
rolling stock within two years. ''The winners have an appetite for new
investment,'' he said.
However, Labour Shadow Transport Minister Brian Wilson lambasted the
sale. He said the announcement guaranteed the companies around #800m a
year and a surplus of #500m a year, all paid for by passenger fares. He
claimed rail users are getting no guarantee of investment in return.
''Given the huge asset base of more than #2000m and the eight-year
guaranteed revenue stream, it will be deplorable if these companies are
sold for anything less than #3000m,'' he said. Mr Wilson stressed that
Labour would bring these companies under the control of the rail
regulator to guarantee that the desperately needed investment in rolling
stock was actually delivered.
Liberal Democrat transport spokesman David Chidgey said it was an
outrage that such an important component of the rail service could be
sold off at a knockdown price. ''Even more scandalous is that the new
companies are under no obligation whatsoever to purchase new rolling
stock.''
.
Meanwhile, Railtrack Scotland was yesterday accused of refusing to
hand over copies of a structural report undertaken by British Rail on
the Forth Bridge in 1992.
The Labour MP for Cunninghame South, Mr Brian Donohoe, claimed
Railtrack Scotland director Paul Prescott had refused his request for a
copy of the report by letter on the grounds that the best assessment of
the state of the bridge would come in a full report currently being
prepared by the Health and Safety Executive.
Mr Donohoe said: ''I am very concerned by Mr Prescott's refusal to
respond to a very simple request for a copy of a report that has been
sitting on a shelf for the last three years.
''This is information which should rightly be in the public domain and
to refuse to supply it suggests that Railtrack has got something to
hide.''
However, a Railtrack Scotland spokeswoman stressed the company had
been happy to co-operate with the HSE. She said no structural report had
been made in 1992. The BR report had covered only assessment methods and
painting techniques, which were now out of date.

POLICE were called to Perth prison last night for a second time in 24
hours after a 22-year-old inmate was stabbed.
Michael Fettes, from Dundee, was taken to Perth Royal Infirmary
shortly after 7pm following an incident in the prison's C Hall -- the
scene of an earlier stabbing which resulted in a prisoner's death.
Fettes, serving a three-month sentence imposed at Dundee Sheriff Court
on October 31, was treated for stab wounds in his throat. Police from
Perth were carrying out an investigation inside the jail and were
waiting to interview Fettes in hospital late last night.
A man is due to appear in court today following the death of Robert
Watson in the prison in a separate incident. Watson, 23, of Edinburgh,
was serving four months for attempted housebreaking.
The death of Watson on Thursday has intensified fears that tension at
the prison is at boiling point. It came just hours after an anonymous
letter from a C Hall inmate, warning of trouble to come, was passed to
newspapers.
The letter stated: ''There is a lot of tension in C Hall and the word
is the prisoners on protection are going to get done in as the
mainstream prisoners are getting worked up to a riot and the protection
in this prison is virtually non-existent.''
The anonymous author accuses the prison authorities of ignoring the
plight of protected prisoners who have asked to be moved to the
protection units at Peterhead and Shotts.
Perth prison governor Mike Duffy said last night: ''I admit it has
been tense and it is tense from time to time. But C Hall is a very
stable hall which is why the protection prisoners are held there.
''From time to time, tension builds up when groupings are formed until
the situation is defused. Some people get more anxious than others about
it. I do not give this letter any credibility.''

AN advocate's wife who cultivated cannabis at her Perthshire home
failed yesterday in her appeal against an 18-month jail sentence.
Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, told Rosalind Henderson:
''Whatever views others may take about the purpose and nature of the
production of cannabis, the fact remains that it is an offence which has
been laid down by Parliament as punishable by a sentence of
imprisonment.
''The court's duty is to apply the law as it has been laid down for it
by Parliament.''
In June this year, Mrs Henderson, 44, admitted producing the drug
between February 1983 and May 31 last year at Brae of Monzie, near
Crieff.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard that when police raided the house
they found in a locked room 13 mature cannabis plants being grown by a
soil-less system using powerful lamps.
A propogating tray with 77 spaces for seedlings, most of which
contained a cannabis seedling, were found in a greenhouse.
Her husband, advocate Keith Henderson, 49, faced the same charge but a
jury returned a not proven verdict in his case.
A further accused, Robert Ford, 37, a family friend of the
Hendersons', admitted cultivating cannabis at West Mains Farm,
Tullibardine, Auchterarder, and was also jailed for 18 months. He has
not appealed.
Yesterday, at the Court of Criminal Appeal, Mr Andrew Hardie QC, Dean
of the Faculty of Advocates, for Mrs Henderson, argued the 18-month
sentence was excessive.
He said the plants had been for her own use. She had used cannabis for
many years and had been smoking 10 cigarettes a day.
Mr Hardie explained that as a young woman, she had lost an eye and
suffered facial disfigurement in a car crash.
This was not the sole reason for her smoking cannibis but it had
increased her consumption.
Mr Hardie submitted that temporary judge Robin McEwan QC appeared to
have been influenced by a belief she had intended to supply some of the
cannabis to others. That was not the case.
Mr McEwan had also found no reason to distinguish between Mrs
Henderson and Mr Ford.
However, Mr Hardie argued that Mr Ford's cultivation had been on a
greater scale and he had been the ''expert'' who provided Mrs Henderson
with the technical knowledge about growing the plants.
The Dean also suggested that the offence committed by Mrs Henderson
was the equivalent of simple possession and pointed out that the family
had already suffered a #5000 penalty while Mr Henderson had been
suspended from practice pending his trial.
Lord Hope, who heard the appeal with Lords Coulsfield and Allanbridge,
said it would have been wrong for the trial judge to pass a sentence on
the basis that Mrs Henderson had intended to deal in the drugs.
However, they did not read Mr McEwan's report to the appeal court in
that way. ''It appears he has sentenced her with regard to the scale of
production being carried on by her,'' said Lord Hope.
As far as the comparison with the co-accused was concerned, the appeal
judges said that in both cases there had been a deliberate and
carefully-planned scheme of production.
The plants and seedlings had been at different stages of cultivation
but it was not a fair criticism of the trial judge to say that he had
gone fundamentally wrong in describing the position of Mr Ford and Mrs
Henderson as very similar.
Lord Hope said it was also a misconception to treat the offence of
producing cannabis as the equivalent of simple possession. Production
involved a degree of planning with a conceived beginning and an end.

SCOTLAND appears to have succeeded in its bid to bring a Taiwanese TV
screen manufacturer, 3000 jobs and #750m of inward investment to
Lanarkshire.
It is understood that an announcement will be made next week
confirming the decision of the Chungwha Picture Tube Company, a
subsidiary of Tatung, to site its new plant in Mossend.
It will be the biggest inward investment in Scotland's history and a
major coup for development agency officials who have for months been
wooing Chungwha and the Taiwanese in the face of fierce competition.
No details of what incentives are being offered have been revealed but
it has been claimed that grants of around #90m were put on the table.
According to sources, a senior representative of Chungwha is expected
to sign final papers this week.
It is believed that the Taiwanese decision was influenced by the
country's long and successful history of investment in the UK and
support for the bid from the highest level in Scotland. Industry
Minister George Kynoch was involved in negotiations in Taiwan in August.
However, given the possibility of last-minute disasters, officials of
Locate in Scotland and the Lanarkshire Development Agency were reluctant
yesterday to talk about the deal or confirm that any decision had been
reached.
Dr John Reid, MP for Motherwell North, said: ''If we were to land
this, it would be a major boost to the area but we have lost out before
and I don't want to raise expectations.''
A spokesman for Locate in Scotland said: ''Discussions with the
company about their plans to set up a manufacturing facility in Europe
are ongoing and we expect the company to make a final decision on the
location for the project very soon.''

LABOUR called last night for an inquiry into ''falling levels of
service'' at British Gas after the company announced it was pulling out
of the Charter Mark, the Government-sponsored consumer service standard.
The move, which followed months of speculation that the Government was
poised to strip the company of the award, led the Consumers' Association
to accuse British Gas of running for cover now that the Charter Mark was
beginning to look seriously at performance.
However, chief executive Cedric Brown, who was ordered in April to
improve the company's service to customers or face losing the Charter
Mark, denied he was jumping before being pushed and said the award was
''no longer appropriate''.
The developments came against a background of increasing numbers of
complaints to the Gas Consumers Council, which reached 24,999 in the
first half of 1995 compared with 24,359 during the whole of 1994. In
Scotland, 1083 complaints were received in the first 10 months of 1994
compared with 2119 for the corresponding period this year -- a rise of
96%.
Mr Brown, who issued a public apology to his customers in September
over complaints about poor service, said the company had decided to
withdraw from the scheme, which it joined in 1993, because of the
shake-up in the gas industry.
As a result of the Gas Act, which received Royal Assent on Wednesday,
British Gas must separate its transportation and supply businesses and
face tougher competition.
Mr Brown said: ''We think it is appropriate, therefore, to review the
Charter Mark and we have decided we should say to Government that it no
longer meets the requirements of the business which was there when it
was awarded.''
Public Service Minister Roger Freeman said he ''regretted'' the
decision.
Calling for an inquiry into ''falling levels of service'' at British
Gas, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, Mr Nigel Griffiths, said: ''It
is hard to believe that safety standards are not falling when consumers
are complaining in record numbers.
''The Charter Mark scheme was John Major's flagship. It is supposed to
lead to better services. Ministers are walking away from the problems
consumers face with British Gas.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ''By withdrawing from the Charter Mark,
the fat cats in British Gas management are admitting what the public
have been saying all along. British Gas can't meet decent standards of
consumer satisfaction. This is a damning self-indictment by British Gas
management.''
Mr Colin Brown, deputy research director at the Consumers'
Association, said: ''The simple fact is that British Gas as a business
does not deserve the Charter Mark, as the increasing number of
complaints makes clear.
* British Gas is to stop funding a pensioners' Christmas party so it
can concentrate its resources on redundancy payments for 25,000 staff.

LABOUR launched its ''welfare to work'' plan for cutting unemployment
among young people to almost universal criticism yesterday.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown denied Labour's plan was a concealed
form of workfare, but there were warnings from some of its natural
supporters that elements of compulsion in the package would not work.
Mr Brown hoped it would succeed in getting a large portion of the
280,000 18 to 25-year-olds who have been jobless for more than six
months back to work.
The ''welfare to work'' plan, said Mr Brown, offered training. Young
unemployed people would be required to join the scheme or lose 40% of
their state benefit. Life on permanent benefit would no longer be an
option, he added.
However, trade unions, the homeless charity Shelter, and the Institute
for Public Policy Research, which is normally sympathetic to Labour
policy, joined other political parties in attacking Mr Brown's
proposals.
''It is a tragic irony on the very day Labour's Scottish housing
spokesman, John McAllion, blamed Government benefit cuts for the growing
number of young homeless Scots in London, the Shadow Chancellor should
be proposing further measures which would punish young people,'' said a
spokesman for Shelter, Scotland.
''If Mr Brown wants to force young people on to the streets this is
the right way to go about it.''
STUC assistant secretary Grahame Smith warned Mr Brown that attempts
to compel young people to join training schemes under the threat of
benefit sanctions had been tried in the past and had failed. They would
not succeed in the future, he said.
''The way to get young people off benefit and back to work is to offer
real jobs with training and a guaranteed national minimum wage, or
quality education and training opportunities and a realistic
allowance,'' he said.
His warning was echoed by Mr James McCormick, a research fellow for
the Institute for Public Policy Research.
He said: ''Today's announcement that such rights for under-25s would
be matched with obligations to participate after seven months of
unemployment sends the signal that Labour will be tough on long-term
benefit dependency.''
However, he warned that ''many of those who are unwilling or unable to
participate despite a cut in benefit will have problems of long-term
illness, drug dependency, have left care, experienced homelessness, or
be involved in crime. They cannot be lumped together. Penalties will do
nothing to address those problems.''
Mr Paul Convery, of the independent Employment Unit, said: ''The
evidence shows that coercing young people into training doesn't work.
The vast majority of them want to train provided they know that training
is going to lead to qualifications or to work.''
At the launch of the plan, Mr Brown said Labour's proposals would put
the responsibility firmly on young people to look for jobs and improve
their skills. ''If we do not act, a generation of young people will have
been abandoned with social division, crime, alienation, and all the
consequent problems for the next 40 years.''
The Shadow Employment and Education Secretary, Mr David Blunkett, said
the large number of young unemployed represented a ''ticking time bomb''
threatening the country's social fabric unless action was taken.
The proposals build on Mr Brown's promise at the party conference last
month to help the ''forgotten generation''.
They would cost #900,000 to run in the first year and be financed out
of part of the #3000m Labour expects to raise from a one-off windfall
tax on the profits of privatised utilities.
Those 18 to 25-year-olds unemployed longer than six months would be
given a month to accept a place with either a private employer, the
voluntary sector, a new environmental task force or full time education.
Anyone refusing would lose #14.72 out of their #36.80 benefit. This
was not workfare, said Mr Brown, as that required people to undertake
work in return for benefit.
The sanction is not as tough as will be introduced under the
Government's jobseekers allowance scheme whereby from November next year
someone on benefit refusing reasonable work or deemed not to be looking
hard enough for a job could lose benefit entitlement altogether.
Mr Brown said unemployment was costing the typical British family
about #20 a week in taxes.
Labour's political opponents were united in their condemnation of the
proposals, although offering different criticisms.
Ms Anne McNair, the SNP's employment spokesperson, said: ''No matter
how Gordon Brown tries to dress it up, this is a right-wing, Tory
policy. In the scrap for the votes of Middle England, New Labour are
pursuing a Tory agenda, based on Tory assumptions.''
For the Government, Economic Secretary Angela Knight said: ''Gordon
Brown's make-work schemes will not provide real jobs.

PLANS for a new party of the left in Britain attracted anger, scorn,
and a denial yesterday, with Scottish Militant Labour claiming much of
the credit for the proposals.
Miners' leader Arthur Scargill had presented to a meeting a nine-page
discussion document outlining plans to launch a new party, provisonally
called the Socialist Labour Party, a proposal revealed by The Herald.
The meeting in London involved left-wingers, called to discuss the
Labour Party's move to the right.
However, yesterday Mr Scargill appeared to be softening his approach.
A spokeswoman for the president of the National Union of Mineworkers
said: ''He has been presenting a debate, not a new political party.''
Ms Nel Myers added: ''Mr Scargill only discussed alternatives
following the modernisation of the party under Tony Blair.''
However, this hardly squares with the document written by Mr Scargill
which asks: ''Do we meekly accept 'New Labour'? Do we passively concede
that the party has abandoned socialism and any commitment to common
ownership?''
He then adds: ''Or: do we leave and start to build a Socialist Labour
Party that represents the principles, values, hopes and dreams which
gave birth nearly a century ago to what has, sadly, become New Labour?''
Elsewhere in the document, he states: ''I believe the case for a
Socialist Labour Party is now overwhelming,'' and he suggests an
inaugural conference on May Day next year.
He also claims, referring to the current policies advocated by Mr
Blair: ''In this situation, we do not have the luxury of time; sooner
rather than later a Socialist Labour Party will be born.''
Despite the apparent cooling down by Mr Scargill, there was an
enthusiastic reaction from Militant leader Tommy Sheridan.
Mr Sheridan said the plans appeared to be an attempt to create in
England the kind of radical, community-based organisation the poll tax
campaign had produced north of the Border.
While Labour MPs, particularly in the mining heartland of Yorkshire,
condemned Mr Scargill, other politicians were quick to exploit the
story. Labour ones were variously hostile and scornful, the Tories were
gleeful and the Liberal Democrats dismissive.
The SNP said the proposed breakaway highlighted Labour divisions.
''Labour have moved so far to the right that their traditional
constituency is unhappy,'' said SNP chief executive Michael Russell.
''In Scotland, many of their supporters are switching to the SNP, who
have held the middle ground at a time when in England it is much harder
to distinguish between the parties because the ground is so muddied.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson called Mr Scargill
''yesterday's man with yesterday's ideas'', adding: ''Any breakaway
party is doomed to failure and unlikely to attract anyone of any
consequence at all.''
Scottish Tory vice-chairwoman, Ms Annabel Goldie, said the miners'
leader had ''ripped away the veneer of Tony Blair's One Britain
approach''.
She said New Labour sound bites might appeal to a coterie in London
but they were offensive to others in the rest of the UK.
Scottish Liberal Democrats denied there was any connection between New
Labour and themselves.
''I think Mr Scargill would find that under the glitz of New Labour
real Labour still clings to its socialist ideals,'' said party chief
executive Andy Myles. ''Very few people are going to follow Arthur into
the wilderness.''
The Herald reported yesterday that Mr Scargill is advocating a new,
clearly defined socialist party, to be launched in time for May Day next
year and in a position to contest every constituency in Britain. The
mosthostile reaction came from Labour MPs in his own Yorkshire mining
heartland. Rother Valley MP Kevin Barron joined other MPs in the area in
condemning Mr Scargill as irresponsible and someone who wrecked
everything he touched.
At a time when Labour was attempting to win power and do good for
ordinary people, he said Mr Scargill was once again showing his
propensity to be a ''natural oppositionist''.
However, Scottish Militant Labour welcomed the idea of a new party of
the left. Mr Sheridan said they shared most of the views laid down in Mr
Scargill's political prospectus.
Agreeing that the document sounded like an identikit picture of his
own party, he said of the initial discussions: ''We didn't come in on
the ground floor -- we were already in at the basement.''
Mr Sheridan said Scottish Militant Labour had built strong links in
community organisations but lacked similar strength in the trade union
movement, which Mr Scargill's proposed new party might bring. If the new
party allowed affiliated or dual membership, SML would be keen to link
up with it, he said.
