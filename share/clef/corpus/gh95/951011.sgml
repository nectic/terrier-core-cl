A GAMEKEEPER accused of laying poisoned bait was charged under
wildlife and environmental regulations at Perth Sheriff Court yesterday.
James Lambie aged 24, of Lurgan Keepers Cottage, Aberfeldy is accused
of placing hens eggs containing the pesticide alpha-chloralose on ground
at Farleyer Estate, Aberfeldy. It's alleged that they were calculated to
harm any wild bird or animal which came in contact with them.
It's also alleged that by storing alpha-chloralose in a walking boot
in an unlocked shed in his cottage he failed to take all reasonable
precautions to safeguard the environment and to protect the health of
people, creatures and plants.
A further charge accuses him of improperly storing another pesticide
mevinphos in a Lea and Perrins sauce bottle in an unlocked Land Rover.
Lambie did not appear to answer the charges and the case was adjourned
without plea until October 31.

An 85-year-old recluse who lived in a one-bedroom flat has left #1.8
million in his will.
Bachelor Edmund White, of Southsea, Hampshire, instructed that #1.6
million should go to undisclosed charities, with the rest being given to
friends and relatives.
Mr White was born in Hong Kong, the son of an English father and a
Chinese mother. He qualified as an accountant and worked for a hotel
chain in the Far East before settling in Britain more than 20 years ago.
During the Second World War, he was interned in a Japanese camp in
Hong Kong with his sister.
Wally Kendrick, 70, who lived next to Mr White in Stafford Road,
Southsea, said he was a private man.
He added: ''I never realised he had that much money because he was so
unassuming and dressed like everyone else.''
Mr White's body was discovered by his friend Nancy Thompson, a retired
Wren who lives in the flat below, in April this year.
Miss Thompson said: ''He was not a great socialiser. I think he
preferred to read rather than go out.''
His estate totalled #1,866,094, with #209,000 going to friends and
relatives and the rest to charities.
A clause in Mr White's will prevents executors Midland Bank Trust Co
revealing which good causes will benefit.

Lucy Lockhart looks at the transformation of a small farming village
on the outskirts of Glasgow into Scotland's sixth-largest town.
IN 48 years East Kilbride has changed radically from a farming village
on Glasgow's doorstep to one of Scotland's most successful new towns,
with 70% of homes owner-occupied. Since 1947, when East Kilbride gained
development corporation status, it has become Scotland's sixth-largest
town, with a population of 70,300.
Today it is a bustling, burgeoning place which has mellowed into the
maturity which close on half-a-century of growth and development has
bestowed. Of major importance has been its economic success. The town
houses some 950 businesses which, between them, employ 34,000 people.
Alongside indigenous companies which have continued to grow and expand
stand multi-nationals such as Motorola, Avex, Fuji Electrics and JVC.
Add to this a welcome backdrop of greenness, the 450-acre Calderglen
Country Park and the soon-to-be-opened James Hamilton Heritage Park and
Loch, which has returned a 16-acre loch to the area it covered during
the eighteenth century and provided water sport facilities, along with
32 acres of parkland which will incorporate a nature reserve.
Shopping facilities in East Kilbride are both excellent and
comprehensive. The town centre itself is home to High Street names such
as Marks &amp; Spencer, BhS, Boots and Next, in addition to smaller shops
such as specialist boutiques. The Olympia, Europe's first combined
covered retail and leisure centre, which won international awards for
its design, has been hugely successful, attracting around 300,000
visitors each week.
The New Kingsgate retail park, commended by the British Council of
Shopping Centres, has Sainsbury's and Texas as its anchor stores, and is
another enviable asset. East Kilbride's leisure facilities are
first-class: an ice rink and nine-screen cinema in the town centre
complex; an Olympic-length newly refurbished swimming pool; a major
sports complex; five golf courses; a theatre and an Arts Centre;
GX-superbowl 10-pin bowling alley and local community centres and play
areas.
Just 10 miles away lies Glasgow, with Edinburgh a 40-mile drive. East
Kilbride's direct expressway links with the national motorway network,
taking in an excellent centre of communication.
Little wonder then that the town is viewed so favourably by those
wishing to buy a new home. Well served by 22 primary and six secondary
schools, a most impressive range of retail and leisure facilities, plus
the proximity of open countryside -- not too many towns can boast such a
comprehensive spread of amenities brought together in one convenient
package.
Another very appealing feature is the hi-tech traffic management
system. Linking all the town centre's car parks electronically, the idea
is to advise drivers of which car parks have spaces and which are full.
Stewartfield is East Kilbride's -- and indeed the West of Scotland's
-- largest private housing development. Started in 1986, it is certainly
one of the town's most sought-after housing areas, and is situated
conveniently close to the town centre. It is well placed to take
advantage of the new Heritage park and loch, and has a Safeway
superstore.
Its development is not yet complete, but so far two thousand houses
there reflect the different character and styles of more than 20
housebuilders, while the corporation, as pump primer and coordinator,
has invested #13.5m in the devlopment of the sector, from roads and
services through planning to landscaping and play areas.
Like all new town administrations, East Kilbride Development
Corporation was given a limited life back in 1947. It has used its time
judiciously. On December 30 this year, the development corporation will
be wound up, and its role will be filled by its successors, with East
Kilbride District Council in the forefront. Viva East Kilbride.

DEMAND for serviced flats in Scotland, specifically in Glasgow and
Aberdeen, is prompting growth in the market to rival London-style
provision. ''I would say the serviced flats are a key ingredient in our
own top-of-the-market provision,'' says Paul Mugnaioni of Quality
Street. ''Typically, you are dealing with mobile executives, and you are
operating in a high, value-added market.
''That, I would have to say, is an area which is much more quality
sensitive than price sensitive. You simply can't look to the old days of
'anything goes'. You must be ready to provide the best available
attributes of the private rented sector.
''When you are competing with hotels, you have to offer a service such
as housekeeping -- perhaps two hours in the morning, two in the
afternoon. People like the comfort of their own place, with service
available as well.
''To meet needs in cities like Glasgow and Aberdeen, with their
vibrant economies, we have to cater for incoming executives, people in
new business start-ups, and we have always been in that kind of
sector.''
Indeed there are indications that Quality Street is already actively
thinking of expanding in this up-market area.
That could mean the creation of a new-build project for a block of
flats, say around a #2m capital involvement, in a prime location in
Scotland, with southern-style servicing -- meaning availability of
24-hour staffing, business facilities, concierge, the lot.
The company already has properties throughout the UK, from Aberdeen
and Glasgow to Manchester, Bristol and London.
A total service approach has been built in from the beginning and is
clearly meeting a definite need, particularly among the business sector.
''Prospects in the letting market here are excellent,'' Paul readily
agrees. ''We already have some #42m of investment in Scotland. As
landlords to a large extent, we see the imperative need for letting to
be hassle-free for our clients.''
It also suggests an upsurge in confidence in at least one area of the
local letting market -- the company has recently extensively refurbished
its property on the popular Waterfront development in Glasgow.
The result is 50 flats with upgraded entrance area, kitchens and
general interior furnishings -- plus specially commissioned art work.
Maid service available. It also means rents just over the #1000 a month
mark.
The prospect of increased competition, however, does not unduly
trouble a major local player such as Countrywide Residential Lettings,
where John Harvey points out he is more in the traditional side of
managing on behalf of owners rather than being a landlord as such.
''We do, of course, look after various aspects like tidying gardens,
dealing with stairs and closes, and generally servicing blocks of
flats,'' he points out. That service is available, whereas people taking
over other property would look after things themselves.''

McLEAN Homes Scotland's development at East Kilbride is The Larches,
situated in the desirable Hairmyres area, just 20 minutes from Glasgow
by car.
On this site, prospective homebuyers will find what the company calls
its American range of houses: Arizona, a three-bedroom detached villa
with en-suite master bedroom; Delaware, Virginia, Carolina -- the
largest house on the site -- and the newly introduced split-level
Pennsylvania, all of which offer four-bedroom accommodation, again with
the master bedroom en-suite.
Each house is traditionally built and has gas-fired central heating,
and the double glazed UPVC windows have distinctive Georgian-style
astragals. A fireplace is fitted in every lounge as standard, complete
with gas fire; there is an oven, hob and hood; and homebuyers have a
choice of colours for kitchens and bathrooms, with matching tiling. All
the houses have single garages, with the exception of Carolina's which
is a double. Front gardens are turfed, while rear gardens are top
soiled.
The price range starts at #85,000 for the Arizona, rising to #115,000
for the Carolina, with the Pennsylvania, the new addition, priced at
#110,000. ''They are really super value,'' says Irene Hazlett, McLean's
Homes sales supervisor.
''We will have a total of 115 houses eventually at The Larches, she
goes on. ''At present, 50 have been completed and are being lived in,
and we have a continuous building programme.
''Our show houses have been opened for quite some time, and the sales
we have for 1996 are good. We are selling very well and in the present
market, we are most encouraged.''
All open spaces at The Larches will be landscaped.

CONSTRUCTION is now under way at Tay Homes' award-winning site, The
Crescents, at Stewartfield in East Kilbride, the largest private housing
development in the town and one of its most popular.
The first phase of 28 luxury villas of four or five bedrooms is due
for completion by the turn of the year, and a showhouse will be ready
for the grand opening of the site in January. The villas are priced from
#99,500 to #147,500, and already the company has either sold or reserved
a quarter of them, including the two largest properties.
''The Crescents was the last site left in Stewartfield, and the
Development Corporation put it out to a design competition which Tay
Homes won,'' says Iain Stewart, the sales director.
The external appearance of the houses is, he says, ''very attractive
with plenty of landscaping, and there are quite a number of mature trees
around the site. The designs of the houses are different from our
existing site in East Kilbride, although internally the designs are
similar to the previous development''.
A second phase at The Crescents will provide 30 luxury flats of two
and three bedrooms, with prices expected to be in the region of #80,000
to #95,000.
But to return to the present and the luxury villas now under
construction. ''These houses all have our up-market specification, so
they have a higher range of kitchen units than normal, with under-pelmet
lighting; one-and-a-half bowl sinks; integrated appliances --
fridge/freezer, cooker hood and hob, separate oven with microwave and a
dishwasher. Utility areas will have space for a washing maching and
tumble drier,'' says Stewart.
All master bedrooms will have an en-suite, some with both bath and
shower cabinet, and one house style has two of its bedrooms each with an
en-suite -- ideal for older families with teenagers who insist on
hogging the shower.
Master bedrooms and lounges have cornicing instead of coving, and a
choice of fireplace in the latter rooms will be offered, set off by a
living-flame fire.
''We are trying to give as much specification as possible,'' says
Stewart. ''Gone are the days, I think, when people were looking to buy a
house for investment purposes. Once they've got the location that they
want they are then looking at the product.''
The Crescents -- so called because of the shape of the two roads which
service the development and the curving design of one block of flats --
is well placed for the town centre and its sports facilities.

ANOTHER award-winning site, this time Redrow Homes (Scotland)'s
development at Kittoch Muir in East Kilbride's Castleglen, adjacent to
Stewartfield, has recently released its first properties to the market.
Situated on the north-west boundary of the town, it is well placed for
both the town centre and surrounding countryside.
The three and four bedroom-houses are offered at prices from #104,950
to #135,000, and two fully-furnished showhomes will be opened on
Saturday.
Each house on the development will have double glazing, gas central
heating, fitted kitchen with built-in oven, hob and cooker hood, master
bedroom with en-suite bath or shower room, downstairs cloakroom with WC
-- all sanitary ware is white, Victorian-style, with brass effect
fittings and antique pine or mahogany finish bath panel, loo seat and
dado rail. Each house will have either a single or double garage.
The larger homes have further features such as a utility room, study
and additional kitchen appliances, for example, a fridge/freezer and
dishwasher. Culross, the largest house style, has two en-suites in
addition to the family bathroom.
Redrow Homes (Scotland) is a subsidiary of the Welsh-based Redrow
Group, which was established 21 years ago. It acquired the Kittoch Muir
site towards the end of last year after winning a design competitition
run by East Kilbride Development Corporation.
Since this time, John Anderson, regional director of Glasgow-based
Redrow Homes (Scotland), said: ''Having introduced the Redrow name to
the Scottish housing scene, we have attracted a great deal of interest
from potential customers.
''Over the last few months, we have built up a long mailing list of
interested parties, and they have all been issued with our new brochure
of these first houses. We will be very surprised if reservations have
not been taken by the time the showhouses are unveiled.''
The company, Anderson explained, ''has taken our most popular Redrow
styles -- already highly acclaimed for their quality and attention to
detail -- and adapted them for the local market, with white render and
traditional slate-look roof finishes. We think that Scottish homebuyers
will be impressed with what they see.''
Considerable landscaping at the site will include ''a densely
tree-lined avenue leading to an existing motte which is set to become a
central feature of the development,'' adds John Anderson.

Stewart McIntosh reports on the renewed interest in a return to urban
living
A QUIET tide in the property market is transforming historic period
buildings in Edinburgh and Glasgow. The elegant townhouses of
Edinburgh's Georgian New Town and Glasgow's Park District, which became
popular as offices after the last war, are gradually returning to their
proper use -- as places in which to live.
In the biggest deal project of its type so far, property developer
Walker Group (Scotland) is poised to restore Edinburgh's prestigious
7-16 Rothesay Terrace into housing. The terrace served for many years as
the corporate HQ of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. Walker
Group has now gained planning consent for a #6m refurbishment programme
which will convert the property back from offices into flats and
townhouses. This reverses the long trend of similar housing being
converted to office use and puts the initiative under the scrutiny of
the property industry, especially since it is the largest reconversion
scheme yet to take place in the capital.
Prominently located at the north-west end of Edinburgh's New Town,
Rothesay Terrace was built in 1898 and offers outstanding views to the
north over Dean Village towards the Firth of Forth and Fife. Its
location on the fringe of the New Town means that it is particularly
attractive as a residential area, benefiting from its close proximity to
Princes Street, theatres, restaurants, and public transport.
Rothesay Terrace's character derives from two eras. Georgian formality
combined with rich Victorian detail provides a strong impression of the
prosperous security of late nineteenth century Edinburgh.
Ironically the lands were originally owned by the Walker Trust (no
relation to the Walker Group family business of builders) which was set
up on the death of Victorian developer Sir Patrick Walker.
''Our track record in refurbishment, commercial new build and quality
house building gave us the natural edge over many of our competitors to
acquire such a prestigious location,'' says Mike Walker, chairman of
Walker Group.
The restoration project comes 103 years after the original Walker
development was entrusted to a range of celebrated Edinburgh designers
and architects, including Peddie &amp; Kinnear.
The developer plans to convert the 10 interlinked houses into
residences which will incorporate the original features including
fireplaces, wood panelling, and cornices. All of the flats will be fully
refurbished with new electrics, heating, and fitted kitchens and
bathrooms. Most main bedroom will have en-suite facilities.
The majority of the flats will have two bedrooms, although a limited
number of studio and one-bedroom flats will be created -- along with a
number of four-bedroom flats. Some of the apartments will be serviced by
a lift.
All flats will have at least one car parking space in the secure
landscaped car park with discreet security lighting, and almost all can
be accessed from both this rear car park as well as the main Rothesay
Terrace entrances. Residents will have also the use of well maintained
private gardens adjacent to the Terrace.
Meanwhile, the return of Glasgow's Park district to residential use is
picking up in pace. As predicted in Scotland's Homes earlier this year a
slow, but remarkable, transition is taking place. Simon Homes, a small
specialist developer which converted numbers 19 and 20 Royal Terrace
into flats, has now purchased numbers 4 and 8 in the same terrace -- and
intends to give the redundant offices the same residential treatment.
''We've almost sold out at numbers 19 and 20 at prices between #80,000
and #125,000,'' says Tom Coakley of Simon Homes. ''So we've proved that
there is a demand for housing in this historic area overlooking
Kelvingrove Park. It's the park which is the great selling point, people
just love the outlook and there are plenty of pioneers prepared to move
into an area which has been dominated by offices for so long. It's a
feather in The Herald's cap for predicting this transition.''

WHEN the going gets tough, the tough get going. And they don't come
much tougher than Sir Lawrie Barratt. When his house-building firm
almost hit the rocks during the recession he came out of retirement,
took the helm, and steered the company back onto course. Now, when other
builders are throwing down their hods and scrapping their cement mixers,
Sir Lawrie is launching a #60m ''Festival of Housing''.
Undaunted by the clouds of doom and gloom which have sapped the
confidence of some of his rivals, he is releasing new house styles which
will cost between #195,000 and #450,000. And the hunt is on to find
sites in Scotland which can match the upmarket requirements of such
costly homes.
Unveiling his new proposals, Sir Lawrie bluntly dismissed those firms
which have had enough and are disposing of their house building
sections. He said: ''During the 1980s a number of contractors,
conglomerates, financial institutions and others entered the private
housing sector. But in today's tough conditions their lack of skill in
land development, product design, and sales and marketing have been
exposed. Already some have departed from the housing sector, some have
put their housing divisions up for sale, and others will most assuredly
follow.''
With wounded rivals limping from the field, he is confident that
Barratt can capture the high ground and build its market share. ''Unlike
much of the competition in the industry today, we have a real sense of
direction and we face the future with confidence.''
That confidence and sense of direction is being rigorously applied to
the Scottish market, where sales chief Christine Hill has no qualms
about the challenge of marketing houses that will cost more than
#200,000. She said: ''We're very keen to bring the new house styles to
Scotland, so we are searching for sites right now. These new houses are
very large and require secluded locations in prestigious residential
areas like Newton Mearns. As soon as we have found the sites, we'll be
building showhomes in Scotland to show off our new designs.''
Having watched the steady progress of upmarket builders such as CALA
and Bryant, both of which have been enjoying sales success at prices
over #150,000, she is convinced that Barratt can tap into the prestige
end of the market in Scotland.
''Sir Lawrie is demonstrating his great faith in the market. We've set
our stall out and we're saying that there is a market for quality houses
on good sites. Nobody is suggesting that it's easy to get sales in the
current market, but if you work hard there are profits to be made.''
The Festival of Housing was launched last week when Barratt unveiled a
flagship show village of seven top-of-the-range showhouses at
Collingtree Park, Northampton. These new luxury designs will be built at
selected developments around Britain, including Scotland, and Barratt
claims that they are ''the pinnacle'' of the company's new Premier
Collection.
As well as launching its new house styles, Barratt has created special
show areas at 200 developments throughought the UK where visitors can
view new cottage-style homes which have helped boost sales by 14% over
the past year. In addition, special events are planned with advice
available from solicitors, surveyors and financial advisers.
The firm estimates that the total value of its furnished showhouses on
display throughout the UK in the Festival of Housing is around #60m.

IS this the loveliest house in the Milngavie area? It is certainly one
of the most secluded. One neighbour admits that although he had walked
past the gates many times, he had not realised that Bankell House even
existed until he saw it advertised in The Herald -- such is its
cloistered location just off the Strathblane road, writes Stewart
McIntosh.
Privacy comes at a high price and Bankell House is no exception, but
those who can't afford the big house might find that the separate
gardener's cottage is a much more realistic way of digging themselves
into country living.
Designed about 90 years ago in an interesting mix of Scots Baronial
and Dutch styles, Bankell House is built of rough hewn and dressed
sandstone with feature turrets, crow-stepped gables and a
steeply-pitched grey-slate roof.
The accommodation comprises: turreted entrance vestibule, entrance
hall with feature inglenook, oriel windowed drawing room, sitting room,
formal dining room, full-sized billiard room, pantry, utility room,
kitchen and ancillary storage/utility rooms. There is a feature
staircase from the hall with stained glass window on the half landing.
On the first floor there are six double bedrooms, three bathrooms,
maid's room, three dressing rooms, and inbuilt storage space.
Selling agents Clyde Property say that although Bankell has been well
maintained, it now requires some upgrading and redecoration.
The house contains many period features which include: hardwood
floors, panelled doors, stained and leaded glass, natural stone window
surrounds, beamed ceilings, and timber fireplaces.
Bankell house gets its seclusion from the six acres of grounds which
surround it. A high stone wall and pillars give way to a sweeping
driveway which leads through mature woodland to the gravelled courtyard
in front of the house. To the front and side of the house are lawns with
shrubs, trees and bushes. To the side and rear of the house are
established fruit trees, a vegetable garden, and gravelled pathways with
flower borders. There is also a full-sized tennis court which is fenced,
but in a state of disrepair.
The gardens enjoy a bright southerly exposure, and high stone walls
and mature trees around the boundary offer plenty of privacy.
The two-storey gardener's cottage stands in the grounds, screened from
the main house. It has its own access onto a farm road which leads to
Strathblane Road. The cottage has a living room, kitchen, bathrom, and
two bedrooms. Attached to the gable wall of the cottage are two large
garages or store rooms which offer the potential to create a larger
home, if required.
The cottage, which has a courtyard to the front, may be sold as a
separate lot from Bankell House and its grounds.
Clyde Property is seeking offers over #475,000 for Bankell House and
cottage. Lot 1 Bankell House and grounds -- offers over #395,000. Lot 2,
the cottage, offers over #80,000.

THE Scottish League will almost certainly have to seek new sponsors
for the Coca-Cola Cup, originally known as the League Cup. It is
believed that the multi-national group, which also sponsors the same
competition in England, is unlikely to renew its arrangement once the
present deal runs out in 1997.
The world-wide American soft drink firm is understood to be switching
its interest to youth sport, where its marketing ambitions would be met
across the globe, although there was no official confirmation from the
company yesterday. A spokesman did admit that a ''strategic review'' was
to be undergone next year.
Scottish League spokesman David Thomson expressed surprise at the
suggestion the company would pull out. ''As far as we understand they
have been happy with the short, sharp competition that we have in
Scotland.''
The tournament, which was in danger of extinction until it was
revamped and backed by Alloa Brewers in 1985 and renamed the Skol Cup,
was without a sponsor for a year after the Skol support ended in 1993
but Coca-Cola stepped in with a #3m deal over four years.

CELTIC, who have been given only 3400 tickets for the away leg of
their European Cup-winners' Cup second-round tie against Paris
Saint-Germain, are hoping to keep their supporters happy by showing next
Thursday's match live on screens at Celtic Park.
The club believe they will be able to receive a signal from French
television and hope to be able to erect two large screens on their pitch
and give the next best thing to those fans who want to travel but can't.
Fergus McCann, the club's managing director, was questioned about the
ticket policy for the game in Paris, because there are fans who want to
travel but not with the agency who are acting as the club's sole agent
for this game. Disclosing the plan to have live pictures of the match
beamed into Celtic Park might appease some, but not those who are
determined to be in Paris.
They argue that Celtic's agency are charging more for a one-night stay
in Paris than another agency which has acted on behalf of Celtic
supporters for a long number of years. Hynds Travel, for instance, say
they can provide flight and accommodation packages -- and to the same
hotel -- for more than #100 less than the agency dealing with the
tickets.
Some shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting of Celtic plc were
unhappy with what they regard as a system which, they say, will cost
them extra, and it has been said fans will travel in any case. However,
that might cause problems with security, and McCann urged people not to
travel without tickets.
To get any of those allocated to the club, season ticket-holders must
register through Celtic's appointed agency.

In the next two or three years we hope to have the entire stadium
complete.
FERGUS McCANN
THERE was no fanfare and no triumphant procession into the developing
arena. Ostentatious Fergus McCann most certainly is not. The chairman of
Celtic plc and managing director of Celtic Football Club has no more
than a nodding association with flamboyance and is to be found only
occasionally under a fedora.
Yesterday, as he climbed the stairs leading to a makeshift platform on
the edge of the Celtic Park playing surface, he should have been wearing
a bowler hat. He spoke in the language of the businessman as he
addressed approximately 1100 of the club's 10,200 shareholders at the
annual meeting.
Celtic's lowest home attendance of the season huddled together under a
brooding black sky, but the portents were misleading. There was little
pessimism around and the club were confident enough that their year's
endeavour would be welcomed for the first time in Celtic's 107-year
history that the media were allowed to eavesdrop.
We all heard mainly good news as delivered by McCann and his team of
directors and advisers who sat with him on the platform. The past year,
he said, had been one of ''transition, rebuilding, and significant
progress.''
Before long the sun had broken through and shareholders were
applauding. One or two, in proposing or seconding a resolution -- or the
''revolution,'' as one man from the King's Park supporters' club said in
error -- thanked McCann for his work in dragging Celtic back to where
they belong.
The fans are encouraged by the Scottish Cup in the club's boardroom,
spending on new players, and the new north stand. Perhaps the truly hard
part will be in maintaining progress on all three fronts.
Celtic plc's annual report for the year ended June 1995 showed a
''dramatic improvement'' in its financial stability with a loss of
#401,000 compared to a #1,404,000 loss the previous year. McCann pointed
out that costs of #846,000 for having played a season at Hampden had the
effect of creating a loss, but the improved performance was helped by
the club's increase in turnover by 19% to #10.4m.
Season-ticket sales had risen from 7100 to just more than 26,000 in
two years and, naturally enough, the chairman, paid #36,000 last year
according to the report, was encouraged by the Scottish Cup succcess
last season. The public share offer, which increased the share capital
to #25.4m and raised #13.2m net of expenses, was also highly
encouraging.
With glad tidings being carried on the blustery wind, churlishness
would have been out of place especially as the audience were facing the
impressive new stand which was built and fitted out at a cost of just
more than #17m. The shareholders are rightly proud of the way Celtic
Park is emerging and when completed it will, indeed, be a splendid
theatre of sport and dreams.
So far, so good, then, with the north stand up and in use and Burns
able to spend #6.4m on players, but what next?
''We have to make sure our financial partners are in place and make
sure that we don't spend a great deal of money and go into further debt
at the expense of supporting the development of the playing staff,''
McCann said.
Nevertheless, the supporters were expecting to see the workmen move
from one job to another and apart from some activity behind the west
goal area where a temporary stand for 3000 is being built not a lot
appears to be happening on a grand scale.
The east end of the ground is where the next stand will be erected,
but no-one knows when. ''We may well be able to start shortly'' was
about as far as McCann could take that one and with regard to completion
of the full project he again was unable to be specific about starting
dates saying only that he hoped ''in the next two or three years to have
the entire stadium complete.''
He spoke, too, of including in the final building a museum, hall of
fame, leisure club, and hotel-type accommodation. There was talk of
being able to ''justify the finance'' to have another 13,000 seats in
place by next August.
It sounded good, but it was vague and, as he spoke, the thought
occurred that a previous Celtic board were pilloried for having been
vague. Celtic's fans and the media demanded answers and specifics and
they wanted their leaders to be fully accountable.
Since Burns has been able to sign six players, McCann obviously
realises the need to make finance available to keep the team in decent
shape, but it is reasonable to ask where the money for the remainder of
the building work can be found.
The shares issues were remarkably successful and McCann himself
invested about #10m of his own money, but there were other investors
also. There may have been a total fund nearing #30m, but the club's debt
of around #6m had to be cleared and if we also deduct the cost of the
new stand and Burns' shopping money, it becomes fairly clear there isn't
a lot of cash left to complete the rebuilding of a 60,000 seater
stadium.
The club have just more than 26,000 season ticket holders but the bulk
of that income may also have been swallowed up through construction and
general running costs which would include wages. ''There are players
here who are among the top paid in Britain,'' McCann said.
That is as it ought to be for a team with ambition, but it will be
interesting to see if Celtic can raise the rest of the money through
public and private funding. Asked how much more the manager would have
to spend on players, McCann replied: ''It is never a finite amount. It
depends on the circumstances and justification for the given deal. Right
now, we are still potentially in the transfer market for new players.''
If McCann secures the finance to complete the programme and meet all
objectives the next annual meeting will have to be held away from Celtic
Park. The applause would bring the new house down.

AIRDRIE, without a home to call their own, have turned to the local
community and local authorities to help secure the future of the
117-year-old club, which had to move from their Broomfield ground just
over a year ago.
Since then, Airdrie have been ''lodging'' with Clyde at Broadwood
Stadium in Cumbernauld, while at the same time exploring all avenues --
and almost every open space in Monklands. The first-division club was
stunned last week when the application for a 10,000 all-seated stadium
on the outskirts of the town was thrown out by Strathclyde Region
planning committee.
And yesterday Airdrie chairman George Peat and his board of directors
pleaded for help and understanding. Peat pointed out that now was the
time for the local people to show that they really wanted a senior club
in their area.
A statement from the directors said: ''We thought we were away ahead
of the majority of football clubs when in 1989 we started to investigate
the possibility of building a new stadium.''
But it was financially impossible to re-develop Broomfield, and
Airdrie sold it to Safeway.
The statement continued: ''Instead of being ahead, we still have no
home six years later, while clubs like St Johnstone, Clyde, Stirling
Albion, and now Livingston have sailed through planning applications.
''It took us to our fourth choice of site before we were successful
with Monklands District Council.
''When we first discussed the possibility of moving, we did not expect
to encounter so many obstacles. Neither did we believe there would be so
many people unwilling to help our cause.
''Most of the money we received from Safeway is still there, but that
fund is ebbing as the seasons go by. Time is running out on our
ambitions and we are calling on Monklands District Council, Strathclyde
Regional Council, and MP Helen Liddell to assist us in securing a decent
and promising future.''
Chairman George Peat added: ''The club belongs in its own district,
which is why Broadwood, which we much appreciate, is not ideal.
''Now is the time for the people of Airdrie to prove they really want
a football team.''

IF the Republic of Ireland do not beat Latvia in Dublin this evening
-- a not unthinkable option considering the home team's recent form --
one of the most controversial and charismatic managers in modern
football may take his final bow. Indeed if the Irish fail to make next
year's European Championship finals, Jack Charlton is likely to go in
any case.
He said as much when I bumped into him at York races earlier this
summer. ''There is only so much you can do with a small squad of
players,'' said Charlton. ''I've had a terrific time in Ireland and want
to get out before the supporters become disappointed in me.''
It was on February 7, 1986, that Charlton was appointed to the Irish
post -- a kind of minor miracle in itself. Big Jack, the former England
and Leeds centre half, had his player's medals all right but had only
recently departed in acrimonious manner as the manager of Newcastle
United.
Of the 18-man executive of the Football Association of Ireland given
the task of finding a new international manager, only three had Charlton
as first choice. Not that the post sounded all that rosy; the Republic
had been eliminated from the World Cup and the association was
practically broke.
They wanted to appoint Billy McNeill as a part-timer but the former
Celt, then manager of Manchester City, was refused permission to take
the job by his club. The next favourite was 65-year-old Bob Paisley,
ex-Liverpool, with Johnny Giles, Liam Tuohy, and Charlton making up the
list.
Paisley had nine votes on the first ballot. Charlton beat him by 10
votes to eight on the fourth. Though few would have predicted it at the
time, an Irish national hero, from England, had been born.
Under Jack, Ireland would cease to be one of football's laughing
stocks, would instead become the most successful international outfit in
the British Isles.
Charlton would steer his adopted lads into the 1988 European
Championship finals in Germany.
His next target was the World Cup in Italy two years later. They
qualified comfortably and it was here that his love affair with the
Irish fans flamed into life.
A penalty save by Packie Bonner in the game against Rumania brought
the country to a standstill, and Ireland only succumbed to Italy 1-0 in
the quarter-finals.
To this point Jack could do no wrong. But he did it his way.
Established Irish-born players like David O'Leary, Frank Stapleton,
and Liam Brady were discarded, into their places came men who would have
struggled to find Dublin on a map, ''mercenaries'' as the Northern
Ireland team-manager Billy Bingham dubbed them.
Charlton was unrepentant. ''They are here to play football, not to
sing the national anthem,'' he retorted.
Big Jack was a dictator, mostly a benevolent one but prepared to mug
anybody, player, official, or journalist who crossed him.
The 1994 World Cup was probably the beginning of the end of the
love-in. A goal 12 minutes from time against, of all people, the
Northern Irish, meant the Republic qualifying for the finals in America,
Charlton and Bingham exchanging insults en route. They began
magnificently, beating Italy 1-0. A 2-1 defeat by Mexico was made even
more agonising when Charlton was banished from the touchline for arguing
with a FIFA offical.
A draw against Norway meant they had to beat Holland. They couldn't --
not after Bonnar had allowed a straight shot to go through him.
Maybe Jack should have gone then, sometimes now he is inclined to
think so. But he was still massively popular and, anyway, who was
challenging him for the job?
He will get out now, however, or at least when the team finally fails
to qualify. His boys are men now, many on the wrong side of the hill.
The seemlingly inexhaustible supply of players with Irish grannies
appears to have temporarily dried up. Yet his contribution has been
immense.
Charlton owns a pub and has a share in a chip shop in the Republic.
''Ireland has the best fishing in the world. I will never leave it
completely.'' God help the guy who succeeds him.

Stockholm
SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown has decided that tonight will be the time
to throw sentiment aside as he builds a squad for the European
Championship finals in England next summer.
Brown will still not accept that he has taken the team to the finals
-- although that may be finalised this evening if Greece fail to win in
Russia -- but he recognised that he must plan ahead.
He said: ''We want to be in England and I think we will be there. But
there comes a time when you must look at the players available and make
up your mind who will go to the finals.
''We have used, I think, 28 players so far in the qualifying games. We
cannot take that number to the finals and, therefore, I must start to
look seriously at who will go and who will be left behind.
''Sentiment cannot come into it. I have to look at the players who
will be able to do a job for us. That's all that matters.''
Brown will not discard players who may lose form over the warm-up
games he has planned but he wants to see how others may perform and
tonight is a new beginning for his squad.
The manager believes that Sweden, despite their current problems, will
provide a serious test. He also believes that his own players must rise
to the occasion and prove to him that they have the qualities he
requires.
His team is along the lines one would expect, one he has chosen with
an eye to next summer. He will play Stewart McKimmie, a sweeper, behind
Colin Calderwood and Colin Hendry.
Alan McLaren will play in front of that trio, to curb the threat of
Parma striker Thomas Brolin, who is so effective for his country.
Brown maintains that, despite the number of defenders, that the team
he plays will be positive. He wants his midfield players to get forward
and support the two strikers he has chosen.
He will also utilise the other players he has with him. Billy
McKinlay, Blackburn's #1.8m target, and Eoin Jess, would seem likely to
appear for the second half.
Said Brown: ''We have the opportunity to use all five substitutes, but
we can use two of them at half-time and we will do that. We don't want
to interrupt the flow of the game but we want to see how some of our
players will react in this situation.
''Eoin will be used up front when he comes on. That is where I think
he could do a job at this level. He has skill and great ability and is
more than just a foot soldier. He has attributes other players
recognise. Just listen to what Gary McAllister says about him.''
We did that, and McAllister, who has shrugged off an ankle injury to
play, insisted: ''It is great to see Eoin back in the reckoning. He has
skills which we all want to see.
''After all, when we talk about the midfield and forwards, we are the
people who have let the country down during this campaign. The defence,
and the two goalkeepers, Jim Leighton and Andy Goram, have got us into a
qualifying position.
''For most of the matches they have carried us. Is is now down to the
midfield and the front men to get their acts together and show just what
we can do.
''Personally, I would like to score over here. The last goal I had was
in the European Championship finals in this country, a penalty against
the CIS when we won the game. It has been too long since then for a goal
to come.''
Brown, of course, will be looking towards the result in Russia as he
prepares his team for this warm-up game. He knows that Scotland's fate
could be determined by others.
If the Russians win, or draw, then Scotland will go through as the
second-placed team in the group.
Then Brown will have to look towards other sections. ''I have worked
it all out and I believe we will not be featuring in the play-off match
at Anfield in December.
''There are other groups where the qualification would suggest that we
will go through to the main draw without having to play another match.
''I think the Republic of Ireland will look at a play-off as their
best option now. There are other groups, too, to be looked at.
''Spain and Denmark is another match which could affect our situation.
But the main thing remains qualification and we will know the result in
Russia before we kick-off tonight.''  The team is:
Leighton (Hibernian), McKimmie (Aberdeen), Calderwood (Tottenhum
Hotspur), Hendry (Blackburn Rovers), McLaren (Rangers), Burley
(Chelsea), McAllister (Leeds United) captain, Collins (Celtic), Boyd
(Celtic), Roberton (Hearts), McGinlay (Bolton Wanderers).

Sweden B 1, Scotland B 2
KILMARNOCK striker Tom Brown, who was pulled into the Scotland set-up
just 12 hours before the squad left for Sweden, scored the goal which
gave the B team victory in Stockholm last night.
Brown replaced Scotland's other goal-scorer, their skipper Duncan
Shearer, in 78 minutes.
It was an inspired change because, just eight minutes later, it was
the Kilmarnock man who sent in a low shot which beat the Swedish keeper
and gave the Scottish shadow squad the victory they wanted.
Only 1232 fans -- including Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan, who made a
surprise appearance along with his club's commercial chief Freddie
Fletcher -- were in the Rasunda Stadium to see the game, but that will
not damage Brown's memory of his first goal at this level.
The front player, who not so long ago was starring in the Junior Cup
final, will relish this moment of fame.
Afterwards Scotland manager Craig Brown said: ''I was very pleased for
Tom Brown. He was hauled out of his house on Sunday night to join the
squad and here he is, in Stockholm, and scoring the winner.
''It was a typical strike from him and I think that we deserved to win
the game.''
The Scots had been in front after Duncan Shearer scored the opening
goal in 36 minutes. Rob McKinnon swung in a cross from the left and the
veteran Aberdeen hit man, captain for the night, sent a header beyond
the Swedish keeper Magnus Hedman to give the Scots a lead they deserved
at that stage of the match.
Beforehand, manager Brown had declared how much he would enjoy
watching the midfield which was paraded in this game. However, the men
he deployed in that area -- Paul Telfer, Alex Rae, Scott Gemmill, and
Paul Bernard -- did not show as much as the manager had hoped.
There were moments from all of them, but as a unit they did not excite
as much as Brown had predicted.
Telfer, playing wide on the right, and Gemmill, in the central area,
looked best. Both gave indications that they could step up to the full
side if required.
By half-time the Scots decided to change things. Bernard and Gerry
Creaney both went off to be replaced by Paul Lambert and Kevin Harper.
There were further changes from the management team of Tommy Burns and
Murdo MacLeod 13 minutes after the interval with Bryan Gunn and Colin
Cameron taking over from Nicky Walker and Rae.
By now the Scots had lost some of their earlier rhythm but in 68
minutes Harper moved on to a through ball from Steven Tweed, beat the
goalkeeper with his shot, only to see defender Andreas Jakobsson clear
his try just short of the line.
There were indications from the Swedes that they could produce
problems for the Scotland defence. In 75 minutes Bryan Gunn saved from
Andreas Andersson but two minutes later there was no way he could stop
the same player from equalising.
Mikael Hansson burst into the penalty box, sent the ball into the
heart of the penalty area and Andersson scored with a low shot.
It was then down to substitute Brown. He appeared in place of Shearer
12 minutes from the end, and eight minutes later he scored the goal
which will live in his memory.
Steve Tweed sent the ball forward, it broke from a defender, and there
was Brown to hit a low ball into the net. It was an opportunist's goal,
the kind of strike which has been the trademark of the Ayrshire front
man.
It was enough, in the end, to give Scotland a victory, enough to have
Craig Brown leaving this stadium with the boost he needed before
returning tonight with his full squad.
Said Brown: ''It is always good to get a win away from home. Any team
would be happy to do that.
''Paul Telfer did very well and I think, also, that Scott Gemmill
showed up very impressively in the middle of the park, while Kevin
Harper's pace was electrifying.
''There were many good things to be taken from this game. That is why
we wanted a B international, to see how certain players could perform at
this level.''
Scotland can be happy with the result. Perhaps the midfield did not
show the class Brown had hoped for, but his team were playing against a
nation who finished third in the last World Cup.
There were competent performances from the solid professionals such as
Brian Martin and Shearer. And there were bonuses from the younger
players such as Gemmill and Telfer. All of them looked as if they could
slot happily and comfortably into the first team.
Now Brown has to face the main Swedish side and look for a similar
performance, and hopefully, a similar result, in this same stadium
tonight.
Certainly the Scotland squad who watched the game will be heartened by
this victory.

HEARTS manager Jim Jefferies, who has been trying hard to arrange
transfer deals to freshen his squad, is expected to bring in two new
players today, with two leaving Tynecastle.
Former Rangers player David Hagen is to be swopped with Falkirk
midfielder and ex-Celtic man, Steve Fulton, as Jefferies goes back to
his former club to make his first move since taking charge at Tynecastle
at the start of the season.
It is also understood that another swop deal will be concluded within
the next 24 hours, when St Johnstone goalkeeper Andy Rhodes will join
Hearts in an exchange for John Millar. Jefferies has used three keepers
so far this season -- Henry Smith, Craig Nelson, and Gary O'Connor --
but it seems that Rhodes will become the fourth to try to give him
stability.
Falkirk manager John Lambie is still interested in striker Colin
Cramb, who is out of favour at Tynecastle under Jefferies -- who sold
him to Hearts for #50,000 from Brockville.
* DUNDEE United teenager Dale Gray broke a leg in a reserve game on
Monday, joining half a dozen Tannadice players already in plaster.
Manager Billy Kirkwood is expected to renew interest in Celtic striker
Willie Falconer now that the Tannadice move for Bolton's Owen Coyle has
fallen through. Coyle guested for Dumbarton last night as they lost 3-2
to Rangers in a testimonial for the Boghead kit man, Dick Jackson.
* LARS Bohinen has admitted that controversial agent Rune Hauge was
heavily involved in his recent cut-price move from Nottingham Forest to
Blackburn. However, the Norwegian claimed: ''There is nothing illegal or
anything for Blackburn to worry about.''
The English FA are preparing details of the transfer for FIFA's
inspection because of suggestions that Hauge, whose ''gifts'' brought
down Arsenal manager George Graham, has taken a cut from the #750,000
Ewood deal.
Bohinen said: ''It was natural for me to speak to him -- he's
Norwegian, he has done all the Norwegian transfers to English football
for the last 10 years, and he's very good at this game.''
His move, cashing in on a clause in his contract from his #400,000
move from Young Boys of Berne which put a ceiling on a future move of
#750,000, infuriated Forest manager Frank Clark. Bohinen insisted that
Clark declined ''several'' offers to buy out the clause.

RUGBY UNION
IRELAND have sounded out sacked Australian coach Bob Dwyer about
taking over their national side, but he said yesterday this would have
to fit in with his job with a French club.
''I have a commitment with Racing in Paris until the end of March but
how binding that commitment is, that's another question,'' Dwyer said.
''There is no possibility of taking on anything which would replace my
commitment to Racing. The only question is whether there is something
which could be dove-tailed.''
Tom Kiernan, chairman of the Irish Rugby Football Union election
sub-committee, said: ''We have spoken to Bob Dwyer as we have to other
people. While he said he would be interested in talking about the
situation, he has a lot of personal matters to look into.''
The IRFU could have difficulties in accommodating Dwyer as they search
for someone to lead Ireland towards the 1999 World Cup finals in Wales.
Current coach Gerry Murphy, in charge for this year's World Cup in South
Africa, is still in contention to keep the job.
Queensland's John Connolly, beaten by Greg Smith in the recent vote
for Dwyer's successor as Wallaby coach, informed Kiernan he would not be
available. ''I have given the matter great thought and discussed the
position with my wife and family. Domestic factors were a major
consideration,'' said Connolly.
He is due back in Brisbane on January 21 to honour a two-year
agreement with Queensland. Connolly has been coaching Irish Division 1
club Old Belvedere since the start of the Ireland league three weeks
ago.
Kiernan said his committee was moving as quickly as possible to fill
the Ireland post and would report to the Union on Friday.

BADMINTON
KIRSTEEN McEwan, of Bridge of Weir, is tipped to make it a hat trick
of junior titles this weekend at the Scottish under-21 championships at
Meadowbank in Edinburgh.
The No.1 seed and defending champion in the singles and doubles, where
she partners Pam Whiteford, of Airdrie, McEwan also is favourite in the
mixed where she lines up with Erskine's David Forbes.
Following her victories last year, McEwan vowed to earn a senior cap
within 12 months. Everything seems to be going according to plan for the
determined physiotherapy student, who first represented Scotland as a
12-year-old and played in the Scottish under-16 squad while just 14.
Meanwhile, Scottish senior champions Bruce Flockhart and Anne Gibson
will fly out to Denmark today to play in the Danish Open in Odense.
Flockhart meets Indonesia's Dwi Aryanto in the first round, while
Gibson will play world No.29 Christine Magnusson, of Sweden.
The Scottish Badminton Union also have announced that the remit for
the job of national director of coaching and development will stay the
same after the departure of Allan Campbell, but more emphasis will be
placed on performance and excellence duties. The SBU will soon the
advertising for Campbell's replacement. Scotland's under-18 team for the
Danish Junior Cup, Gentofte, 14-17 October is:
B Sutherland, K Graham (Fauldhouse), P Hardie (Duns), D Murray
(Strathaven), D Gibb (Polmont), K Threadgall (Linlithgow), K Sneddon
(Lochgelly), A Thain (Culloden).

SQUASH
WITH the World Open just four weeks away, Scotland's Peter Nicol is
hoping to get into winning ways at this week's Canadian Open.
The world No.4 has had a disappointing start to the season and is in
danger of dropping a couple of places in the next world rankings.
As a result, he decided to pull out of the defence of next week's US
Open, avoiding a possible clash with Jansher Khan, and opt for the
Canadian event in Toronto, where he is favourite to land the top prize.
''Peter hasn't won for a while, and if he does pull it off in Canada
it will be the perfect confidence booster before the World Open in
Cyprus,'' explained the Scot's London-based manager, Neil Harvey.
Nicol meets Finland's Juha Raumolin in the opening round and should
then come up against fellow-Scot, Martin Heath.
''It took Peter a while to recover from a tonsil operation in June,''
added Harvey. ''But I've been delighted with his recent work-rate, and a
fitness test last week was right off the scale.''
The junior game received a boost with the announcement that the Bank
of Scotland have signed a #10,000 deal to continue their sponsorship of
the Scottish Junior Open for another three years.
Australia's eight time British Open champion Geoff Hunt has confirmed
that he will be bringing a squad to this year's championships at
Colinton Castle from 28-31 December.

THE world's biggest rugby tournament is to be staged throughout
Scotland over a four-day period during Easter, 1997.
The International Festival of Youth Rugby, the brainchild of Glasgow
enthusiasts, Ronnie Graham and Peter Laverie, received the blessing of
the Scottish Rugby Union last week and the aim is to attract more than
10,000 participants from all over the globe.
The tournament, to be backed by The Herald, will take place from April
1 -- April 4, and the organisers hope that representatives from the four
home unions plus France, Italy, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia
will take part.
The invitation, from SRU president Ian Todd and director of rugby Jim
Telfer, declares: ''Our aim is to have youngeters share in a unique
event which promotes all that is good about our game.
''Rugby provides that magical combination of endeavour, skill,
friendship, and fun with which players can speak a ''common tongue'' and
be united across the globe.
''Our emphasis is on playing the game, and while there will be
eventual winners, everyone will have had a chance to play on tour and
there is nothing more enjoyable than a rugby tour. In addition to the
competition, we have organised an unforgettable concert and fireworks
display together with local leisure and recreation activities.''
Yesterday, Telfer said that the tournament would be staged at numerous
centres and the organisers would be soon circulating clubs with details.
''It will be played mainly in Glasgow and Edinburgh, but it also is
the intention to put on matches in the Borders, Dundee, and Perth.
''It will be open to players aged from 11-15 years,'' he said.

FELLOW-SCOTS Sam Torrance and Colin Montgomerie are in opposite halves
of the draw for the #650,000 Toyota World Matchplay Championship, made
yesterday at Wentworth, but both have intriguing encounters in
tomorrow's first round -- the former against Bernhard Langer, along with
Montgomerie a threat to Torrance's ambition to win the European order of
merit title, and the latter against David Duval, almost certain to be
the US Tour's 1995 Rookie of the Year.
Moreover, should Montgomerie win he would in the second round face
Australia's Steve Elkington, who beat him in a play-off for the US PGA
championship at the Riviera Country Club in August. If Torrance, the
other British representative, wins he would play the former Open and US
PGA champion, Nick Price, the No.2 in the Sony world rankings and one of
the four players to be seeded.
The other two to have been given byes are the holder, South Africa's
Ernie Els, who awaits the winner of the match between US Players'
champion Lee Janzen and Japan's matchplay champion, Katsuyoshi Tomori,
and US Masters champion Ben Crenshaw, who will meet the survivor of the
battle between Costantino Rocca, a newcomer who won three points in the
Ryder Cup match, and Vijay Singh, who is playing for the third time.
Torrance, who is making his first appearance in the event, now in its
thirty-second year, for a decade has not advanced beyond the first round
in two previous attempts. On both occasions he lost to a Japanese -- by
2 and 1 to Toro Nakamura in 1985 and by 6 and 5 to Tommy Nakajima the
following year. Whether or not he can overcome a more obvious peril
remains to be seen.
''It was always going to be tough but Langer is definitely a tough
one,'' said Torrance after practising with Ryder Cup captain Bernard
Gallacher yesterday.
''His strength is his mind. He is very determined, very steely, and
has a great will to win. And he has an incredible short game.''
Torrance at the weekend regained first place on the merit table from
Montgomerie, who had to withdraw from the German Masters because of a
damaged hand, but Langer's second-place finish in Berlin after his
victory the previous week in the European Open in Ireland enabled him to
draw up to third place, well within striking distance of the two others.
The issue will only be resolved in the final counting tournament, the
Volvo Masters in two weeks' time at Valderrama. Before then Torrance,
who knew he would be playing this week less than a fortnight ago, when
Severiano Ballesteros declared his self-imposed five-month exile from
the competitive game, and Montgomerie have the more strenuous programme.
Whereas both will play for Scotland in next week's Dunhill Cup at St
Andrews, Langer, as he almost always does, will not represent Germany in
a tournament in which players take part in a minimum of three rounds.
Instead, Langer will have a week's rest as preparation for the final
fray in the tournament which he himself won last year.
Ballesteros, who shares with Gary Player the record of five victories
in the event, is an absentee for the first time since he made his
initial appearance, in 1976, and so also are Nick Faldo, twice the
winner, and Ian Woosnam, who in 1987 became the first British
professional to take the title after five of them, including Sandy Lyle
three times, had been beaten in the final.
Thus Els, who last year beat Ballesteros, Jose-Maria Olazabal, and
Montgomerie on the way to the third of his five victories worldwide last
year, is the only previous winner among the 12-strong field, vying for
the first prize of #170,000, an increase of #10,000 on last year. Even
the disappointment of a first-round defeat will be soothed by the
substantial consolation of a #30,000 cheque.
Apart from Montgomerie, however, three former beaten finalists are
taking part -- Price, Langer, and Crenshaw, all of whom, as it happens,
were among Ballesteros' victims. And only four of those competing are
not among the leading 20 in the world rankings -- Crenshaw, who is
No.25, Rocca, a place further behind, Duval, No.39, and Tomori, who
rarely ventures beyond Japan and occupies by far the humblest position,
108th.

TENNIS
DAVID Lloyd, Britain's Davis Cup captain, was in confident mood
yesterday after having heard the draw for next year's competition.
Britain, in the Euro-African Zone Group Two -- in effect, the third
division -- will play Slovenia at home from May 3-5 and, if successful,
will then probably play against Ghana away from July 12-14 and then
Egypt at home from September 20-22.
''I like our draw very much,'' said Lloyd. ''If all goes well, there
is no reason why we should not go up next year. On paper, we have a team
that can win promotion. Greg Rusedski has just gone up to No.35 in the
world rankings, his highest-ever, and Tim Henman and Mark Petchey are
doing well.''
Slovenia's top two players, Iztok Bozic and Jaka Bozic, are ranked 401
and 989 respectively and should cause Britain little trouble. However,
Lloyd sounds a note of caution. ''We should beat Slovenia but sometimes
you don't know what these teams can do if you have not seen them or they
do not play on the circuit.''
Next year's cup competition has drawn a record entry of 124 nations,
nine more than the previous record set last year. Draw:
Euro-African Group 2 -- Gt Britain v Slovenia, Ghana v Malta, Egypt v
Macedonia, Latvia v Ivory Coast, Poland v Nigeria, Luxenbourg v Belarus,
Yugoslavia v Slovak Republic, Algeria v Portugal.
World Group (first round) -- Italy v Russia, S Africa v Austria,
Switzerland v Germany, France v Denmark, India v Holland, Sweden v
Belgium, Czech Republic v Hungary, USA v Mexico.

GOLF ROUND-UP
STEVE Elkington, the US PGA champion, will have a new Scottish fan
club following his bid tomorrow for the world matchplay title at
Wentworth.
The Australian proved popular when he met up with 12 young golfers
from Grampian last week. The group were on a trip to Houston in the USA
as part of a sponsored deal to further their golfing careers.
Elkington, based in Houston, passed on the chance to earn #40,000 so
that he could provide them with a coaching clinic. On top of that he
then took them to his house for dinner.
Now one of the youngsters, one-handicapper Claire Hunter, 17, looks
certain to be offered a golfing scholarship at Texas A and M College.
Bruce Davidson, head professional at Aberdeen's Kings Links who
organised the tour, said yesterday: ''I have been a friend of Steve's
since our university days in Houston. Some time ago he promised he would
give the party a day to remember, but that was before he won the US PGA
title.
''I could have understood if he had pulled out because demands on his
time are enormous now that he has a major title to his credit. He can
make #40,000 from a company day but was determined to fulfil his
promise.
''Steve is a man of the people and this is why we will all be rooting
for him at Wentworth.''
* COLIN Ferguson qualified for the Mt Ellen Assistants event which
tees off today with an excellent six-under-par round yesterday in
pre-qualifying.
He headed Jim MacKinnon by three strokes into the tournament which is
the final counting event towards the Scottish PGA Assistants' Order of
Merit. Leading qualifiers:
62 -- C Ferguson (Royal Troon). 65 -- J MacKinnon (Braid Hills). 67 --
G Clark (Auchterarder). 69 -- B Dempsey (Crieff). 70 -- G Wheelaghan
(unatt), N Sneddon (Murrayshall), F Hall (Helensburgh), D Drysdale
(Dunbar), S Greig (Crail). 71 -- D McCallum (Paisley), R Brian
(Baberton), C Munro (Ranfurly Castle), J McKie (Ayr Belleisle), J
Fiddler (Longniddry).
* AYRSHIRE women's meeting (Irvine Ravenspark). Scratch: 85 -- K
Paterson (Prestwick St. Nicholas). Silver handicap: 74 -- A Gray
(Prestwick St. Nicholas, 15). 76 -- I Smith (Kilmarnock Barassie, 13).

ROWING
THE recent club-level coaching camp at Pitlochry was a success, giving
rise to the thought as to why the sport's governing body does not carry
out more.
It has been suggested that the rowing association is devoting too much
time to preparing for next year's World Rowing Championships and, in the
process, is allowing club-level work to be neglected.
It is true that this year's regatta season has been thin, with few
clubs running events and fewer crews taking part in the regattas that
are staged. It also now appears that one of the traditional recruitment
beds for the sport -- Glasgow Schools Rowing Club -- has breathed its
last, and its decline over the past decade is now being reflected in the
relative weakness of the senior Glasgow clubs.
There are more examples of the poor health of club-level rowing
throughout Scotland, but it is not all bad news. New centres of
strength, such as Aberdeen and Inverness, are building, and some
established clubs are flourishing.
The key aspect for the Scottish governing body to recognise is that
some clubs have found enterprising new solutions that have helped them
grow.
It is the job of the national association to spread this good practice
further and assist growth in those parts of the country that are weak,
rather than concentrating too much on the glamourous international side
of the sport.

BOXING:
JIM Murray, the 25-year-old from Newmains who challenges fellow-Scot
Drew Docherty for the British bantamweight title in Glasgow on Friday
night, was yesterday given the best possible incentive for success -- a
chance to meet World Boxing Organisation champion Alfred ''The Cobra''
Kotey for the world crown.
Kotey, from Ghana, is, of course, the man who beat Docherty inside
four rounds at Cumbernauld last February in what was the British
champion's last ring appearance. Now, Murray is aiming to go one better.
Andy Ayling, an associate of Londoner Frank Warren who co-promotes
Friday's show with Katherine Morrison, gave Murray the news yesterday
when he came face-to-face with Docherty at a reception given by
Glasgow's Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall in the City Chambers.
Ayling also revealed that a Kotey-Murray match could be part of a
double header featuring ''Prince'' Naseem Hamed, the youngster from
Sheffield who recently won the WBO featherweight title by stopping Steve
Robinson in Cardiff. Hamed will have a fight at an English venue --
possibly for another world title --in December then he will head back to
Scotland where he has built up a huge following.
Said Ayling: ''Naz has specifically asked Frank Warren to get him
another fight in Glasgow. He loves the place and wants to keep going
back. We are talking about a date around March and the venue would be
the SECC. If Murray wins on Friday, then he would join Naz on the bill,
probably against Kotey.''
Said Murray, who has lost just one of his 17 professional contests:
''It's certainly a great incentive and I mean to take my chance. I have
enjoyed fighting on the big bills and this is a crossroads in my career.
Failure would put me back to being just a stand-in boxer, but I won't
fail.''
The Lanarkshire man also revealed that this was a sort of grudge match
against the champion. ''I want revenge on Drew,'' he said. ''In our
amateur days, he stopped me in the third round at the semi-finals of the
Scottish championships. In my next fight Davie Armour, who is now the
European and Commonwealth bantamweight champion stopped me in two
rounds.
''Before they beat me I had only five amateur fights -- I was just a
raw kid. I know I would beat Armour now without any sweat and I'm
confident about the job against Drew on Friday. He hasn't looked too
impressive in his last two fights, while I'm getting better all the
time.
''I've got a good, strong chin and I have never been dropped as an
amateur or as a professional. I don't aim to start now.''
Murray's trainer Davie Douglas said: ''Docherty took a hammering
against Kotey. He's a good, clever boxer, but Jim can box too, and,
unlike Docherty, he can also punch. I think it will go six or seven
rounds and Jim will either stop him or knock him out.''
Docherty, the quiet man of the ring, gave a little smile and said:
''Everything has gone well in training for the fight and I've been
sparring with heavy punchers. This is a big one for me and I feel as
good as I have ever felt.
''I respect Murray, as I do all my opponents, and I know he will be
pumped up for this one.''
Friday will also see former world light heavyweight champion Dennis
Andries back in action in Glasgow. Both he and current British
light-heavy champion Maurice Core, of Manchester, will meet American
opponents. Other Scots on the bill will be Alan McDowall, Craig Lynch,
and Scott Dickson, while Australian super-middleweight John McAlpine,
who is now based in Glasgow, will make his Scottish debut.

ATHLETICS
GLASGOW has been rescued at the eleventh hour as an international
venue.
Only yesterday, less than 48 hours before the world fixture congress
in Paris, where meetings for the next 12 months will be resolved, did
Glasgow agree to accept a match against France at the Kelvin Hall on
February 24.
The British Athletics Federation had already booked Birmingham,
fearing Glasgow would opt out, confirmed spokesman, Tony Ward: ''We are
delighted, otherwise there would have been four meetings in five weeks
at Birmingham.''
That would have been a marketing disaster following the axing of the
UK v USA match at Meadowbank, after Edinburgh District Council ran into
financial problems.
''We did look at other options, but with the popularity of the Kelvin
Hall, this was not possible,'' said a Glasgow council spokesman.
These included taking a match against Russia, but their national
championships are that weekend. The Kelvin Hall is due to host a
European hockey event on January 27 -- the day Russia meets Britain in
Birmingham.
* NOTICE of Linford Christie's abdication has been posted, but the
greatest championship athlete, Carl Lewis, yesterday proclaimed his
intention to prolong his reign.
The American, owner of nine Olympic golds, wants to contest the 200
metres and long jump in Atlanta.
The IAAF have confirmed that they had received a letter from Santa
Monica Track Club, signed by Lewis's manager, Joe Douglas, seeking
redrafting of the Atlanta Olympic schedule.
The approach is prompted by an attempt by world 200 and 400m champion
Michael Johnson to have the programme amended in favour of him tackling
those events.
Douglas asks that Lewis's interests be born in mind. ''As the schedule
stands, the 200 metres and long jump are to take place simultaneously. I
would request that the 100 meters, 200 meters, and long jump be
separated,'' writes Douglas. ''. . . Carl is training well and looking
forward to Atlanta.''
* THE verdict of a British Athletic Federation appeals hearing, which
cleared Diane Modahl of any doping offence, will be challenged by the
IAAF, the world governing body's doping commission decided yesterday at
a meeting in Paris. The case should be sent to their arbitration panel
next month.
The IAAF say the panel's ruling is binding, but if unfavourable,
Modahl, who gave birth to a daughter at the weekend, would almost
certainly challenge it in the UK courts.
Her solicitor, and an expert who gave evidence at her appeal, will
attend an IAAF anti-doping seminar today in Paris, where one issue to be
debated is the degradation of urine samples -- a central theme of
Modahl's case.
* THE 14-year-old South African, Lisa de Villiers, youngest athlete
banned for a doping offence (the steroid, nandrolone) has again tested
positive for the same substance. Suspended athletes must be available
for out-of-season tests.

RACING UPDATE
WHO said fairytales do not come true? Certainly not jockey Declan
Murphy who made a winning return to the saddle at Chepstow yesterday
following an 17-month lay-off due to serious injury.
Many observers feared the worst after the Irishman was involed in a
terrible fall at Haydock, but he received a hero's reception yesterday
after having led from start to finish on Jibereen -- backed from 11-2 to
3-1 -- to win the challenge race.
The success now has given Murphy the confidence to pick up his jumping
career again, probably at Kempton on Saturday.
''Words cannot describe how I feel,'' said Murphy. ''I've never
thought there was a feeling like this in my life. I just don't want to
get off the cloud I'm on.
''I've achieved some good things in my life but never something that
means as much as this. Riding 500 winners in a season wouldn't mean what
this has. What's felt like a dream for 17 months has just become
reality.''
On a bank holiday last year Murphy was knocked into a coma after a
crashing fall from Arcot. He had a blood clot removed from his brain,
his skull was fractured in several places, and his jaw broken.
However, that was forgotten yesterday. ''I felt wonderful and
extremely fit. I think I have come up to the test,'' said the jockey.
* LAMMTARRA, winner of the Derby, King George, and Prix de l'Arc de
Triomphe, has been retired to Dalham Hall Stud.
It was thought that the unbeaten son of Nijinsky would run in the
Breeders' Cup Turf in the USA, but a spokesman for the colt's owners,
Goldolphin, said yesterday: ''Lammtarra has been retired. He had a hard
race in the ''Arc'' and we think that the Breeders' Cup will come too
soon.
''He had no more to prove having won the three best races in the
world.''
* RICHARD Dunwoody, the champion National Hunt jockey, is the man
tipped to step into the breach as Norman Williamson sits out the next
few months of the season with a broken leg.
Dunwoody was a 33-1 shot to retain the riders' title after his split
with trainer Martin Pipe, but he has been cut to 14-1, having been
booked to ride for Kim Bailey at the end of the week.

Ross Finlay reflects on an eventful century for a company which has
emerged with the last laugh
SKODA is on rather shaky historical ground in celebrating a centenary
right now, since the parent company was founded as long ago as 1859, and
this year marks the 100th anniversary of the first bicycle produced by
what was eventually the motor manufacturing firm of Laurin and Klement,
which it bought over in the mid 1920s.
However, there is a great deal of goodwill towards Skoda, which
suffered like the rest of Czechoslovakia, under first of all Nazi and
then Soviet domination between 1938 and the Velvet Revolution in 1989.
Some of the cruder vehicles the company produced in those years gave it
a reputation at odds with its own history, as the industrial powerhouse
of a country which, 60 years ago, had the highest per capita GDP in
continental Europe.
While Skoda -- pronounced Shkoda in its homeland, and taking its name
which translates as ''it's a pity'' from Emil Skoda who founded it --
developed as a massive armaments, military vehicle, locomotive and
aircraft engine combine, Laurin and Klement moved from bicycles to
motorcycles and then to cars which had a fine European reputation in
races, reliability trials and speed hill climbs.
Even before the Laurin and Klement takeover, Skoda had been building
vehicles by agreement with their original manufacturers elsewhere. There
was a Skoda Hispano-Suiza and, as happens so often with engineering
companies, a tenuous Scottish link. For a while, Skoda built steam
lorries under licence from Sentinel of Shrewsbury, the company which was
originally Alley and MacLellan of London Road, Glasgow, and later
Polmadie.
When Skoda really got down to business with car production on its own
account, although some of the models were quite humble affairs, others
were grander designs, and there was a strong sporting element. Skodas
did well in events like the Monte Carlo Rally, beginning a tradition
which continues to the present day.
The company has a well-regarded competitions department, right now
engaged in the San Remo Rally in Italy, which finishes this afternoon. A
three-car team will be entered in next month's RAC Rally, an event in
which Skoda has a remarkable record of class wins. Some of its rally and
racing cars, as well as examples of the production range through the
decades, are on show at the factory museum in Mlada Boleslav, which
opened to the public last month.
Skoda's fortunes improved when it discarded rear-engined designs in
favour of the front-engined Favorit and, now, the improved and smarter
Felicia. Being taken under Volkswagen's wing gave it access to far
better funding and technical development than was available to it
before.
The advantage to the Volkswagen group, as well as the obvious widening
of its market, is the low-cost nature of the Czech Republic's economy.
Just how long the Czech factory workers will tolerate wage rates
one-tenth of what is paid to their counterparts in Germany is, of
course, another matter.
Skoda will be expanding its Felicia range considerably within the next
few months. An estate version -- longer, wider and higher than the
Favorit estate which is holding the fort till then -- will be launched
in the UK before the end of the year.
At first, the Felicia estate will be available with Skoda's own
1.3-litre engine, trim levels starting at LXi Plus, and a target price
around #8000. Early in 1996 the long-promised VW-engined versions will
arrive, using the German 1.6-litre petrol and 1.9-litre diesel units.
At around the same time Skoda will bring in a limited-edition Felicia
which gives the nod to the company whose first bicycle inspired the
centenary celebrations. The Laurin and Klement, in 1.3-litre hatchback
and 1.6-litre estate forms, will have alloy wheels, a sunroof, central
locking and -- for the first time in any Skoda product seen in this
country -- full leather trim. It will be sold in quite small numbers,
but its arrival is just part of the biggest sales push Skoda will ever
have mounted here.

SCOTTISH grain producers have been reminded of the need to achieve top
marketable quality if they are to secure home markets and prevent
imports filling any supply gaps.
Reviewing the 1995 harvest, Willie Ferguson, regional general manager
of Dalgety Agriculture, said that considering the volatility of world
grain markets the importance of quality would be paramount.
''The Scottish Quality Grain Assurance Scheme is very important to us.
It is also critical to the maltsters who are actively driving the
scheme,'' he said.
His company has set a target of 750 farm members by 1998 and at
present has 220. Livestock farmers, as well as maltsters, were aware of
the need for quality assurance and the end users, the supermarkets, were
continually raising their quality standards, he said.
''It will become an order qualifier, rather than an order winner with
a premium.
''The Scottish label is universally acknowledged as a benchmark of
quality, a unique selling advantage linked with beef, lamb, salmon,
potatoes and whisky. We must uphold this quality image. Cereal growers
can grab the benefit through the quality assurance scheme, and lock out
growers from other countries who cannot meet the quality demands,'' Mr
Ferguson added.
But cereal growers were warned that the EU export restitution system
had already seen export potential to Africa lost to non-EU countries
such as Hungary.
On harvest prospects, crop marketing manager Edward Rust said that
wheat yields were put at 8.1 tonnes per hectare (t/ha) but crops
harvested after the early September rains were only around 6t/ha with
the North-east worst hit. He said the estimated percentages of the total
Scottish crop affected by severe weather were 20% of wheat, 15% spring
barley and 33% of oats.
''Good demand from the Scottish and European maltsters, coupled with
the loss of a lot of North-east malting barley, has kept the market
firm. But there is clearly a notable surplus of Scottish feed barley
that will need to be exported -- providing sufficient restitutions are
granted by the Commission.''
Milling oats supply and demand is expected to be finely balanced with
milling premiums holding, but much of that harvested after September 1
is greatly deteriorated and being downgraded as feed with a differential
of as much as #25 a tonne.
* PROVISIONAL estimates from the Ministry of Agriculture for England
and Wales cereal production puts wheat at 7.63t/ha (7.35t/ha last year),
winter barley at 6.19t/ha (5.78t/ha), spring barley at 4.89t/ha
(4.69t/ha) and oats at 5.75t/ha (5.83t/ha).
Production yields are estimated at wheat 14.2m tonnes, winter barley
4.3m tonnes, spring barley 2.6m tonnes and oats and other cereals
700,000 tonnes.

<TEXT>
PROTESTORS against livestock exports have done far less damage to the
beef industry than seemed likely a year ago, writes MIKE INGRAM.
It is almost certain there will be no flood of cattle to weaken the
1996 market as a consequence of forced retentions of bull calves that
would otherwise have gone to the Continent.
Near conclusive proof comes from French Customs' statistics reported
by the Meat and Livestock Commission. They show that imports of calves
from the UK in the first half of this year were actually higher than in
January-June 1994, at more than 92,000 head.
As France takes nearly half the British calf export total, it will
clearly be impossible for the trade upheaval to result in the 100,000
tonne boost to 1996 UK domestic market beef supplies which had seemed
conceivable when the protests were at their peak at the beginning of the
year.
Even more encouraging, there is confirmation from the same source that
the French are taking far more carcase beef out of the British market.
Their imports from this country were running more than 25% higher in
January-June this year than in the first half of 1994.
This is in line with trade surveys at the time by the MLC, suggesting
that its more recent estimates of a further increases in the sale of
beef to France since mid-year will also prove accurate.
One cloud on the horizon, however, is the spate of rumours of a
possible devaluation of the French currency, which might take some steam
out of the trade for a while. Interest rates were raised in France this
week in an attempt to shore up the franc. A collapse in its value could
weaken the attraction of British livestock and meat to French buyers.

EDINBURGH Oil and Gas is heading for full-year profits of almost
#600,000 following yesterday's announcement that the West Frisby
on-shore field in Lincolnshire is expected to produce a natural flow of
426 barrels per day.
Edinburgh owns 46.66% of the field it shares with Irish-based Tullow
Oil, which holds 53.34%, and hopes to increase production to around 700
bpd once the well has been put on pump. Its share will average 20% of
the output, 140 bpd, currently selling at #10 a barrel.
And there could be a pre-Christmas bonus for the company which is
hopeful of a 100 output from its wholly-owned Crosby Warren field near
Scunthorpe, where it will start drilling operations next week.

<HEADLINE>Gas and oil bonanza untapped in North Sea field. Golden Block has added sparkle</HEADLINE>

THREE years from now the first gas is due to flow from the second
floor of a UK ''multi-storey'' oil and gas development 130 miles
north-east of Aberdeen.
The Golden Block is the popular name for block 16/26 which has on its
top floor, 6000ft below the seabed, the pioneering Alba Field which went
into production last year.
A further 7000ft down is the middle floor, the giant Britannia Gas
Field, which is the biggest undeveloped gas discovery in the UK sector
of the North Sea. It extends across five blocks and is being developed
at a cost of #1500m.
Even further down at 15,000ft is the Helvellyn Field whose wealth has
yet to be uncovered, but it is believed to be a large gas reservoir
which could put added sparkle into the Golden Block for Chevron and
Conoco.
There may be one further surprise and in the years to come the Energy
Minister may have to give the go-ahead to Parliament -- the name given
to a prospect three miles north of Alba which could contain up to 30
million barrels of good quality oil that could be developed as a
satellite.
Although the Britannia field was discovered in the mid-seventies it
was not until 1987 that its commercial potential was confirmed. However,
even three years ago, the field was not considered viable.
The initial development cost was to be #1800m but the partners decided
it was not economic at that figure. The project went back to the drawing
board and after a #300m cost reduction they approved it and last
December it was also given approval by the Energy Minister, Tim Eggar.
Even as the development work is carried out it is constantly being
reassessed and the joint operators are hopeful that a further cost
reductions will be made from the total by the time gas starts to flow in
October 1998. It is expected to continue flowing from the 20-mile by
six-mile field for 30 years.
When production starts it will meet about 8% of the UK's daily gas
demand.
A major factor behind the cost savings was drilling the required wells
from just two centres rather than four, made possible by ''extended
reach drilling''.
Eighteen of these wells will be drilled before the first gas flows and
one third are now complete, all having so far exceeded expectations.
One of the significant cost reductions in the project was achieved by
the use of ''slim hole well technology'' which was developed by Chevron
and can save around #1m a well. It allows faster drilling but involves
the use of narrower casing which is less expensive.
The two rigs which are drilling the Britannia wells, the Sedco 711 and
the Sovereign Explorer, underwent upgrades costing almost #2m in total
before starting to allow them to work more efficiently and in heavier
weather.
Throughout the project Conoco and Chevron have challenged the norm to
determine if boundaries can safely be extended. They have also ensured
that all their equipment is fit for its purpose and carries no ''bells
and whistles''.
The gas from Britannia is the first from a major reserve to be sold
entirely to the independent market and agreements have been reached with
four purchasers -- Kinetica, Mobil Gas Marketing (UK), National Power
and Total Oil Marine.
Gas and gas liquids will be transported to and processed at the SAGE
(Scottish Area Gas Evacuation) terminal at St Fergus between Peterhead
and Fraserburgh.

JJB Sports is continuing the rapid growth which has spurred its shares
to rise sharply since going public nearly a year ago, reporting profits
89% higher at #4.82m for the six months to July, writes CHRISTOPHER
SIMS.
The result brought a 11p jump in the shares to 419p, which compares
with the 215p flotation price.
JJB is the largest independent sports goods chain in the UK with 139
outlets, including 24 in Scotland. Chairman David Whelan is busily
opening new shops, with the first three out-of-town superstores opening
in the summer.
He founded the business in 1980 after he had built up a chain of small
supermarkets and sold out to Wm Morrison for #1m. This money did not
keep him in style for long so he began the sports goods chain by
acquiring an existing single shop in Wigan.
About 30% of JJB's sales are in replica football kits which is fitting
given that Mr Whelan was a professional player until he broke a leg in
the 1960 FA Cup Final between Blackburn Rovers and Wolverhampton
Wanderers effectively ending his career. He used his compensation money
to start a market stall which marked the beginning of his business
career.
JJB still has plenty of scope to develop its network, though Mr Whelan
is not keen to expand into the M25 area in and around London because
rents are too high. Further afield, he has opened up in Northern Ireland
and in Spain.
* THE Index mail order catalogue, owned by the private Littlewoods
organisation, is set to create 560 new jobs in the north-west of England
through opening three new stores and a distribution centre.
Costing some #29m altogether the new outlets will open later this
month, while the distribution centre will follow next June.

HOT weather is not good news for confectionery sales and so not
surprisingly Thorntons suffered in the prolonged hot summer weather.
Ice-cream sales were insufficient to make up the shortfall in
chocolate demand consequently chairman John Thornton said that there was
''sales and momentum to catch up over the autumn and Christmas period''.
About a third of the group's sales are in December and the company is
confident that improved advertising and new gift selections such as a
Continental ''French'' dark chocolate selection and a Continental
''Belgian'' milk and white chocolate selection, will boost demand.
As well as the hot weather Thorntons, along with other High Street
retailers, suffered from a range of negative factors including fragile
consumer confidence, the move to out-of-town retailing and Sunday
opening south of the Border.
Twenty new shops opened during the year, nine of which were
concessions in out-of-town supermarkets.
In the current year, more new openings are planned including the
group's first unit at Heathrow Airport in Terminal Three.
Sales from its 21 French shops were slightly ahead of last year at
#4.6m. However, a weak pound coupled wuth some sluggish sales periods
led to an increased loss of #395,000.
Within the commercial business, sales rose to #17.2m from #16.9m last
year with higher sales to Marks &amp; Spencer, Boots and mail order.
The management structure of the group has been overhauled with the
appointment of a marketing director.
In addition, the group is on the verge of appointing a chief
executive. As a result, David Mitchell, UK managing director, has left
the business.
Thorntons' shares were 4p softer at 149p.

THE Thornton's results coincides with Scottish chocolate manufacturer
Clarke's of Loch Ewe announcing it has now put in place a new
refinancing strategy for long-term growth, writes BILL MAGEE.
The Coldstream-based company, famous for its range of luxury giant
chocolates containing the likes of whisky and champagne, has enjoyed a
10-fold rise in overall sales since Adrian Smith took over the family
firm in 1991.
Now he and business partner, Stephen Nutt, have secured new funding to
enable Clarke's to restructure and expand its Borders town converted
school operations.
Edinburgh-based small company finance specialist Equitas was called in
last spring to produce an independent report on how the firm should
refinance. That review was jointly funded by Scottish Borders
Enterprise.
The package involves a combination of additional family share and
private subscriptions, with the LEC also taking an active part
financially.
Clarke's said it continued to receive the support of the Bank of
Scotland and actual overall funding costs involved could not be revealed
due to commercial confidentiality.
Mr Smith, who represents the third generation of the family-run
company said: ''When we took over sales were miniscule but we have since
doubled them each year, to currently stand well into six figures.''
In the first month of this year alone, the firm sold four times as
much as the previous January, he added. Major airlines are included in a
varied customer base.
Clarke's was set up after the Great War as a family kitchen company
and it moved from the shores of Loch Ewe to Coldstream eight years ago.

<TEXT>
WHY do men turn to pornography? The answer is in the glossy pages of
the same magazines that pose the question. It's simple. Masturbation.
But not every man uses pornography. It just seems that way. Pornography
follows the communist ideal -- it belongs to no-one.
Magazine stacks, videos, and now computer disks always belong to
someone else's mate. So why do so many men use them? The desire for
sexual release is the obvious answer, but it can cover up a multitude of
deeper, more complex reasons.
Peter Baker, a counsellor for men who use pornography, believes:
''This is rarely pointed out, but the reason men buy magazines or phone
sex lines is that they want something to masturbate over. They start
with anticipation and excitement.
''They convince themselves that this issue will have better pictures,
or this time they will get the one line that isn't censored. They are
almost always disappointed afterwards, but disappointment is quickly
forgotten.''
It is a view backed by Glasgow University lecturer David Evans, author
of Sexual Citizenship, who said: ''Most people would not accept that it
is a safety valve, but it is. It's a tool for wanking. It's a release.
Men buy pornography to provide themselves with visual stimulation. They
generate fantasies and then they masturbate. It is orgasm-centred . . .
it leaves the user overwhelmed and pacified.''
It is a depressing truth that a primary source of sex education for
young men is not their parents or school but the crumpled pages of a
men's magazine, either found outside while at play, or at home in their
father's room. Initial feelings of discomfort are replaced by interest
in their naughty, inaccessible find.
In an essay Peter Barker wrote, entitled Maintaining Male Power: Why
Heterosexual Men Use Pornography, he explained that for many men the
discovery of pornography was a rite-of-passage into adulthood, sometimes
initiated by their father or an older relative who bequeathed them their
magazine stack. Yet it was also the beginning of a false relationship
based on power.
He argued that men were inherently isolated, even from other men, and
unable to display signs of intimacy and closeness. Society, he said, had
conditioned men to view women as the weaker gender. The use of
pornography is a subconscious attempt to make this social idea a true
reality, and of course the magazines offer them what they want.
Pornography panders to the male fantasy that women are nymphomaniacs;
that emotional conduct, conversation, all the social skills they lack,
are unnecessary. That men are actually giving women what they want.
Doing them a favour, in effect. Pornography offers a way out of the
isolation many men feel, which is why most men indulge in pornography
when they feel depressed, even though they know its use will make them
feel worse. It is a vicious circle. ''There is something very sad and
desperate about men's use of pornography as a substitute for real human
contact,'' writes Peter Barker.
Phillip, 26, is a father of two young boys who lives in Edinburgh. He
first found a supply of hard-core magazines in his father's study when
he was eight years old. He would flick through them with a group of
friends, then return to them when they had left.
Today he views his use of pornography as a problem. ''I feel it's
unhealthy as I get a real thrill when a pal passes me on a porno-tape. I
can't wait 'til my wife is out. Then afterwards, it's the same feelings
of sleaze and shame. I have been thinking about quitting watching
them.''
The only way porn will disappear is if men decide to give it up. Even
today the lines are blurred as to what is, and what is not, pornography.
The lingerie section of Kay's catalogue can fill such a role for many
men. Yet there are signs of change. Recently men have begun to show
concern about their behaviour. This is caused by changes in society.
The decline of heavy industry has resulted in a break-up in the
traditional notions of masculinity and women are becoming increasingly
resistant to men's behaviour regarding pornography. The increasing
number of couples who through mutual agreement use pornography can be
seen as positive. Couples involving some degree of communication.
But many more are no longer thrilled. Those who need help are seeking
out groups and phone-lines. Scotland's first meeting of Sex Addicts
Anonymous opened recently in Glasgow to cope with people whose sexual
behaviour, whether in casual sex or masturbation, had become a problem.
In all, it adds a slightly different slant to Woody Allen's one-liner:
''Don't knock masturbation, it's sex with someone I love.''

CURMUDGEONLY music critics would doubtless wish to invest an
emblematic quality to Arthur Garfunkel's first non-musical public
performance alongside Paul Simon all of 42 years ago. As 12-year-old New
York classmates, the duo shared the stage in a school production of
Alice Through The Looking Glass. Paul played the White Rabbit; Art
played the Cheshire Cat.
There's an aptness in this casting, critics feel, because Art seems to
have been wearing the same infuriating, self-congratulatory little smirk
on his face ever since -- and what has Art Garfunkel ever created to be
so pleased with himself about?
It's on this point that critics and public are in the greatest
disagreement. To the public, particularly the British public, Art
Garfunkel will forever be the pure, angelic voice of the song they have
consistently chosen in radio polls as the greatest song of all time,
Bridge Over Troubled Water.
Folk can't get enough of it. In 1990, 20 years after its first release
as a single, Bridge Over Troubled Water was saluted at an American music
publishers' awards ceremony for having become one of the most performed
songs of the previous half-century, having notched up 4m performances
around the world. For the record, three other Simon and Garfunkel songs
were in the top 20: Mrs Robinson had also scored 4m times, with
Scarborough Fair and Sounds of Silence both on 3m.
Sure, Art's fans will probably admit that his six-album solo career
hasn't come anywhere near the heights scaled by his erstwhile partner,
Paul Simon. Nevertheless they simply can't forget his contribution to
Bridge Over Troubled Water. Indeed, such is the enduring depth of their
feeling that Art Garfunkel, who hasn't released an all-new album for
seven years, is currently staging a brief UK tour, visiting Glasgow's
Royal Concert Hall tonight. So as far as Art's fans are concerned, pesky
critics can jolly well bog off and think what they like.
They will. They do. And what do they say about Art, for art's sake?
The Guinness Encyclopaedia of Popular Music restricts itself to a
neutral summation of Art Garfunkel's worth, citing him as ''the
possessor of one of the most pitch-perfect voices in popular music''.
Other verdicts are much less positive.
Rolling Stone magazine's Album Guide, a critical survey of more than
12,000 LPs, offers the most balanced evaluation. ''On his own, Garfunkel
exhibits many of the same strengths that marked his work with Paul
Simon: an angelic tenor, a fine sense of subtlety, and a genius for
harmony vocals. Unfortunately, that's not enough to support a solo
career, and without a strong creative voice to play off, Garfunkel's
albums end up as empty as they are pretty.''
Watermark, recorded 17 years ago and featuring songs by master
tunesmith Jimmy Webb, is singled out as the highlight of Garfunkel's
solo career. ''The album's combination of innocence and loss makes it
the perfect vehicle for Garfunkel's voice.''
Another critic isn't so kind. Dave Marsh, latterly one of Rolling
Stone's senior editors, compiled his idiosyncratic book, The Heart of
Rock and Soul, as a guide to the 1001 top singles of all time. Bridge
Over Troubled Water qualifies for inclusion, but Marsh isn't blinded to
its faults.
He notes that Paul Simon was moved to write it by listening to Oh Mary
Don't You Weep, an emotional ballad recorded by gospel legends the Swan
Silvertones. Compared to its inspiration, Bridge Over Troubled Water is
''oversung . . . Art Garfunkel's weightless, trembly tenor removes all
trace of Pentecostal testifying, lending the record an Anglican choirboy
purity that explains much about why it became the biggest-selling record
in UK history.''
And Marsh isn't finished with Art yet. ''The vast, eerie wimpiness of
Art Garfunkel's singing . . . the product of a man who never understood
that 'choirboy purity' becomes anachronistic around the time the
hairline begins to recede.''
Cutting. There are more tangible, less personal criticisms to be made
of Art Garfunkel. Who, for instance, can look upon Art's
legendarily-painstaking 800-hour-long recording of his vocals for Bridge
Over Troubled Water without misgivings? Recording each note of the song
individually . . . doesn't that lead to a bloodless over-perfection?
Why did he insert that meaningless bit about the silver bird sailing
on by? Wasn't Art the guiltier party in the break-up of Simon and
Garfunkel? Didn't he bask o'erlong in Simon's greater musical abilities?
Why did Art object all those years ago to Simon going mildly political
with a song called Cuba Si, Nixon No?
It's probably best to draw a discreet veil over Art's film career.
Wooden, wimpoid, and self-regarding, Art is a man gazing into the camera
lens as lovingly as if it was his bathroom mirror. Heck, he makes Kirsty
Young look like a self-effacing screen presence . . . he makes King Kong
look like a self-effacing screen presence.
But then I would say that because I'm a critic. Just as I'd say that I
find Art's big UK No. 1 hit, Bright Eyes, the syrupy theme tune to
Watership Down, an everyday story of cosy bunnies, the aural equivalent
of myximatosis. But then what do critics ever know?

Michael Tumelty considers a brace of works recounting romance and
sacrifice
CLARA Schumann was one of the most remarkable women artists of the
last century. Born in 1819, she was rigorously groomed as a musician by
her father, who subjected her to a planned programme of work that
dominated her every waking hour.
Her domineering father boasted that she was never allowed, because of
her musical studies, to play with dolls or other children. Even her
personal diary was not her own: until Clara was 18 every entry was
written or supervised by her father.
She went on to become one of the great pianists of the 19th century.
Her career spanned over 60 years. Touring Europe, feted everywhere, she
was idolised by an adoring public and press.
Clara was a composer of dozens of works, mostly forgotten today,
though the Chamber Group of Scotland, in Mayfest this year, paid tribute
to this aspect of her career, and those of other women composers, in a
programme, with a text by Janice Galloway, called Singing Outside Heaven
(being repeated this weekend).
Ironically, with such a glittering career in her time, Clara (nee
Wieck) is best remembered today as the wife of the composer Robert
Schumann. Theirs was an astonishing romance. They had met when she was
very young (Robert was a boarder in the Wieck household), had resisted
fierce opposition by her father to their developing love, and married
the day before her 21st birthday.
It was considered an idyllic marriage. She had eight children,
sustained Schumann tirelessly through his work, and supported him
through his disintegrating mental health and attempted suicide.
Despite their genuinely loving marriage, there was a restless,
suppressed side to Clara. Her husband wanted a domesticated Hausfrau to
bring up the children and let him get on with composing. She wasn't
allowed to play the piano and had to be ''silent and invisible'' while
he was working.
On the one hand, she felt shut out of his creative life. And on the
other, she was deprived of her own. And this was a lady used to fame and
widespread admiration.
She recorded her feelings of frustration in her diary: ''My piano
playing is falling behind. This always happens when Robert is composing.
There is not even one little hour in the whole day for myself.''
That contrast between the public and private aspects of Clara's life
was one of two stimuli in the creation of a new vocal work, a
collaboration between two of today's most important women artists -- the
writer Janice Galloway and the composer Sally Beamish -- which will be
premiered tomorrow at Adelaide's in Glasgow as part of National Poetry
Day.
The other, and related, trigger in the conception of the new work,
entitled Clara, was Robert Schumann's great song cycle, Frauenliebe und
Leben, a passionate cycle of eight songs following the progress of a
woman's life and love, through her childhood, first love, motherhood,
and bereavement. The title of the cycle also gives its name to the
concert.
The original idea, says Sally Beamish, was to produce a companion to
Schumann's idealised portrait of love, using the facts of Clara's own
life. ''Janice produced a parallel text for each song in the Schumann
cycle; but it was far too long and would have needed a 45-minute piece
of music.''
So, using highly compressed and concrete imagery, Galloway
concentrated the text down to 20 minutes. Beamish set the resultant poem
to music as a continuous whole.
''It's a very beautiful and poignant poem,'' says Beamish, ''which
follows Clara's life as if she's looking back.'' And where the text uses
some of Clara's own words, Beamish has paralleled those with quotes from
Schumann's song cycle, ''fragments of melody and rhythm, and one flash
of pure Schumann''.
Clara, the new work, has a particular ethos, says Sally Beamish.
''It's very reflective, not militant in any way. It's about what
happened to these two, about how difficult things were for them. And,
throughout, there's a very strong sense of how much they loved each
other.''
The work, which will be performed by mezzo soprano Sandra Porter and
pianist Graeme McNaught, and will be coupled tomorrow night with a
performance of Schumann's original cycle, has strong personal resonances
for both Galloway and Beamish.
Janice Galloway dedicated the text to McNaught, who introduced her to
the Schumann cycle and who is also the father of her son. Beamish's
dedication of the music is to her husband, the cellist Robert Irvine,
who supported her when she gave up her career as a top violist to
concentrate on composition.
Her dedication reads: ''In recognition of a marriage which stifles
neither's creativity''. Clara Schumann would have appreciated that.

POOR Galina Brezhnev. According to this version by young writer
Nicholas McInerny, Brezhnev's elder daughter had a tough time when the
wealth, privilege and power she'd accrued under her beloved Papa gave
way to Gorbachev's perestroika and she fell from grace. Already a
notorious boozer, collector of jewels and husbands, in domestic exile,
she hit the bottle hard, persecuted those around her mercilessly and
became a thoroughly monstrous incarnation. Not a pretty sight.
Galina's other great love, however, was the Moscow Circus, and when
its director comes to inveigle cash out of Galina for its survival,
their encounter, in McInerny's hands, becomes a startling physical and
philosophical metaphor for the corrupted dream that was Russian
communism and the idea that feeds any revolution. For what McInerny
articulates with unusual force and which Jonathan Holloway, in one of
his most imaginative productions for some gives flesh to is the
evanescent emotion of belief. Holloway's production, in best Red Shift
tradition, acquires tremendous theatrical drive out of the most meagre
of resources. Even with a sacrificial lamb at its core, Red Princess is
a play of hope. As the young trapeze artist turning his back on the past
Rhydian Jones glows with the zeal of the annointed while Fiz Marcus
makes a worthy stab at the drunken, unsympathetic figure that was the
president's daughter.
Red Princess is at the Croydon Warehouse to Sunday then on tour.

MARY BRENNAN looks at a play which cites tenderness as man's Achilles
heel
DURING a stay in hospital -- his Achilles tendon had snapped and
grisly complications set in -- Lloyd Newson found himself wondering why
his male friends didn't visit. When he was home and hobbling, round they
came -- full of ''lets do this 'n' that'' camaraderie.
Newson, typically, couldn't ignore this. He is insatiably curious
about human behaviour, social rituals, and gender politics. His work for
DV8, the physical theatre company he founded some 10 years ago, has been
powered by explorations of the darker sides of human nature.
So, mused Newson, why was it that his women friends -- who had
automatically shifted into Florence Nightingale mode -- were able,
indeed willing to talk about the emotional sub-text of being in
hospital, while male friends couldn't even get to the bedside, let alone
address the sudden sense of mortality and human frailty that strikes
when -- as in Newson's case -- this is your first brush with serious,
incapacitating injury.
Enter Achilles is a reflection of what Newson uncovered once he
started looking closely at what characters masculinity. ''Masculinity is
defined in 'Dont's,' '' he says briskly.
''Essentially it's about men oppressing men. Because whatever men feel
they can't express themselves, they won't allow in others. So, men can't
be tender, sensitive, childish, soft -- really, they can't have the same
range of emotions women have. What you're left with is a sense of humour
and anger. So you can have a joke with your mates and you can get into a
fight. But you can't put your arms round them, say you love them, or
that you know you're feeling lonely, isolated. Isn't that ridiculous, I
mean -- why not?''
Months of research led him to set the piece in a pub, the traditional
bastion of all things laddish, including the male obsession with size
which extends to drink: real men drink pints. The only ''female'' who
appears is an inflatable doll . . . ''I see it as another way of
revealing the male fear of failure,'' says Newson.
''The doll won't ever criticise or reject.'' But even the doll, and
its fond owner fall foul of the rule that tenderness is a weakness that
is not allowed. ''It's the real Achilles heel for men,'' concludes
Newson. ''The notion that they can have a soft, vulnerable spot anywhere
-- particularly one they can't see or protect with the usual behavioural
armour.''
Newson, as ever, has found the vital chink and scoured it into an
explosive and revealing piece of dance theatre.
* Enter Achilles is at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre on Friday and
Saturday at 8pm.

WHAT would Ibsen say to this wicked send-up of his works by Volcano,
the young, physical performance company from Wales. After all, erotic
tangos, masturbatory incitements, and rubber-doll hurling wouldn't seem
on the face of it to have a hell of a lot to do with the father of
naturalism.
I suspect the old radical might have rather appreciated a group
patently committed to finding new forms and smashing old idols. Volcano
have drawn liberally on the Ibsen canon from Hedda Gabler to the lesser
known When We Dead Awaken, creating with their adaptor and director, the
ex-DV8er Nigel Charnock, a helter-skelter, comically burlesque style
that often, and very funnily, exploits the breathy intensity, and
melodrama that ''Ibsenesque'' has come to acquire in our time.
What gives this show its special edge is not only the dynamism of its
four performers, but the original, self-mocking way they weave in their
own sexual and present day personas among the Ibsen tracts.
Despite all the joshing at Ibsen's expense, the torments of his
dualities, and his all-too-obvious sub-Freudian sexual symbolism,
Volcano also pay him the compliment of a sombre final word. Not so much
a travesty after all but a kind of homage.

IN J B Priestley's An Inspector Calls the ruling class is up for
questioning. And in Stephen Daldry's inspired production it's not going
to rest easy in the dock.
Since opening at the National Theatre in 1992, Daldry's interpretation
of Priestley's 1945 socialist melodrama has raked in the awards and made
a rapturously received circuit of the country. Out again, it is fielding
an up-to-the-mark cast (no good-enough-for-the-regions outfit here) with
no corners cut on Ian MacNeil's simply exceptional set.
MacNeil's creation is not only stunning but a real player in the
dramatic impact. Pulling off a bewildering trick of perspective that
makes the King's stage appear to extend to somewhere in the middle of
the Meadows, his sodden, cobbled floor, pock-marked with the bombs of
the Second World War, is torn apart by a toppling undersized town house.
The distorted shapes of its well-to-do occupants not only draw out the
production's theme of disorientation but also the play's theme of the
indignity of our us-and-them social structure.
And just as Priestley takes the playful whodunnit conventions of his
day, turns them on their heads, and spices them up with humanitarian
polemic (still pointedly relevant since Margaret Thatcher denied the
existence of society), so Daldry takes the creakier mechanics of
Priestley's play, explodes them across a non-naturalistic stage and
fires them off with something akin to expressionism.

Dance
SLITHERING and squirming within the one stretchy sheath of hot-red
material -- two forms: one male, one female, each taking it in turn to
come to the fore. From this starting point of shifting ambiguity,
Motionhouse set out to explore the gender shadings in our identity --
how male, how female are we? -- and our willingness to alter the ratio
if the occasion, or the lover, demands it.
''Do you like me like this or like that?'' says a little voice, edging
through the nervy twanging noises of sampled Japanese instruments on the
sound score. The words repeat and repeat.
On stage the dancers shimmy in and out of various costumes, various
sexual roles -- men slip into skimpy little frocks in intense colours, a
woman in shirt and trousers sports a moustache and goatee beard. It's
like the identity equivalent of design your own pizza. Individuals
customising themselves to match the requirements of someone they want to
captivate.
And when the efforts fail -- there's always comfort eating. A huge,
monolithic fridge -- vastly oversized, like the chaise longue and the
screen that comprised the set -- feeds disappointment and self-loathing
with cream cakes and basins of ice cream before the dancers throw
themselves back into the business of reinventing themselves yet again.
As a theme it's both fascinating and relevant -- society is currently
obsessed with appearance, and gender has rarely seemed more flexible,
more a matter of choice and clothing. Visually it's very sharp, very
striking -- the frocks especially -- and some sequences are brilliantly
conceived.
The ''personal ads'' -- where dates are set up in a flurry of
self-promoting hopeful adjectives, while in the background one partner
dances out the fantasy meeting -- are spot on in the evocation of
yearning and fiction.

Music
REMEMBER how Elkie used to be Manchester's answer to Tina Turner with
thigh-high split skirts? That was before she became Pearl, the Queen of
MOR. Well, Tina may still be strutting but Elkie today is a strut-free
zone.
She wears a drab trouser suit and long cardie and she has two
gestures, arm straight out and for maximum thrills, both arms out
together. Sometimes, like the Queen Mum, she gives a little wave. She is
genial but subdued. The communication comes from the voice, with its
irritating bluesy grace notes, and a top band working their hearts out.
Together they highlight the dullness of her back catalogue. Apart from
the Hibernian-tinged Gasoline Alley this is music for lifts, forcing you
to do your heart some good and take the stairs instead. Her job may be
entertainin' folks, but it seems that Elkie herself may be unmoved by
this stuff.
But the interval works its amber magic and things become slightly
strange and much, much better. Back come the boys in (Yo!) kilts and
herself in dark plaid.
There's blues and boogie (providing some wee turns around the stage) a
heartfelt No More the Fool, a melodramatic Lilic Wine and a daft and
dizzy Nights in White Satin. Moral: Forget you're imagined obligations
and do what makes you feel good. Sinful isn't it?

THE sudden meltdown in UK share markets yesterday was largely
influenced by overseas falls, mainly Wall Street. The Dow was adversely
affected by selling of high-technology stocks triggered by Motorola's
disappointing third-quarter earnings. But it was by no means the only
factor. And while any rally in Wall Street is also likely to be mirrored
at home and elsewhere overseas, share markets generally look vulnerable.
The continuing uncertainty in foreign exchange markets with the franc
in particular under the spotlight as the Gaullist Prime Minister Alain
Juppe struggles to impose a pay restraint policy against a background of
strikes, is one factor.
The French are not as amenable to such policies as much as their
British counterparts appear to be and the lifting of short-term interest
rates in France may yet prove insufficient to successfully halt
speculation against the franc for any length of time. If further
increases in French interest rates are necessary, this will inhibit
economic growth and also prolong the difficulties being experienced in
the EMU despite soothing noises emanating from the G7 meeting in
Washington.
But in the UK, markets also have to contend with the possibility of a
general election which could take place sooner rather than later. True,
they have been living with the possibility, not to say probability, of a
Labour Government for some time so a lot has been discounted but there
are also doubts about economic growth and about the likely direction of
interest rates.
The Chancellor's Budget on November 28 with the suggestion that there
could be tax cuts after all, accompanied by a substantial pruning of
welfare benefits inevitably adds to the tensions in financial and
currency markets, as does the fiercely differing views within the Tory
party on the future of Europe. It all adds up to further squalls on the
horizon of which yesterday's market slump could be just a foretaste.
Water watch
A SUGGESTION from water regulator Ian Byatt that quoted water
companies should explain their dividend policies in more detail is
unlikely to find much favour but it would be in their long-term interest
to take it seriously.
The regulated activities have to be kept strictly separate in
accounting terms from the diversified interests which means that a water
subsidiary has to pay a dividend to the group which then declares the
dividend for shareholders.
Mr Byatt is urging the companies to explain publicly the basis in
which dividends are paid by the subsidiary to the group. He will be
watching how many follow his suggestion when the interim reporting
season for water comapnies begins next month.
He considers that the companies should explain to their customers and
the public generally what returns they have made in their regulated
water businesses and what they intend to do with them. They should use
their regulatory accounts to explain to customers and shareholders how
well they perform.
The principal difference between the published accounts and the
regulatory accounts is that the latter are drawn up on a current cost
basis. Such accounts give a more accurate picture of the financial
performance of a long-term capital intensive business.
As non-regulated activities develop, water companies will have the
opportunity in their published accounts to disguise the water
businesses' performance. Yet in time diversified activities may make a
significant contribution to profits and therefore dividends for
shareholders and it will be vital for this to be fully explained if
customers are not to be antagonised.
In the meanwhile, greater clarification would stimulate debate on the
profits made in the water business, the trends in costs and financial
returns, which would possibly mitigate the inevitable denunciations of
the seemingly generous dividend increases by consumer interests.
Lottery toll
THE roll call of companies hit by the phenomenal success of the
National Lottery grows ever longer.
Lloyds Chemists is the latest to add its name to a list that includes
retailer WH Smith, the pools operators, betting shop chains and bingo
halls. Real incomes have been under pressure in recent years with few
pay rises but rising bills.
There is only so much discretionary income around and currently about
#100m a week is spent on lottery tickets and Instants. That sum is equal
to about one and a half times the UK's drug bill.
Lloyds Chemists has noticed a particular marked downturn in certain
parts of Scotland in roll-over weeks when the jackpot rises to around
#20m.
Added to Lloyds Chemists' woes is the deregulation of Sunday trading
south of the Border which has seen much of the household products
business in its drugstores migrate to the large out-of-town shopping
centres which are open on Sunday.
The sheer scale of the superstores' buying power is such that smaller
High Street outlets find it hard to compete unless they are genuine
discount operators.
It is still not a year since the lottery was launched and yet it has
become an integral part of life for half the population.
Retailers have little choice but to accept that fact and change their
businesses accordingly, as Lloyds Chemists is currently doing with the
conversion of its drugstores into health and beauty outlets.

THE issue of standards in public life was well to the fore in the
summer amid allegations of sleaze involving Tory MPs. This resulted in a
code of conduct being put forward by the Nolan Commitee.
But it's not just politicians who have to keep an eye on public
opinion and act accordingly, businesses and their leaders also have a
duty to act responsibly.
The privatised utility bosses have largely lost the support of the
general public because of their perceived irresponsibility in the area
of executive pay and perks.
Closer examination of the facts reveals them to be not as alarming as
they originally seemed, but it is too late as the damage is done. It
takes ages to build up a good reputation but it can be swept away in an
instant.
The vast majority of businesses and their leaders do act responsibly.
Of course, this will vary according to sector with defence and
construction likely to be among the worst performers.
The subject of business ethics is moving up the agenda with business
schools increasingly adding it to their syllabuses. The whole issue of
how to achieve and promote ethical behavior within companies occupies
the Institute of Business Ethics (IBE).
The IBE, which is keen to attract more corporate members, seeks to
clarify ethical issues in business and to propose positive solutions to
problems. On Monday it launched the publication Applying Codes of
Business Ethics.
This includes useful information on implementing a code and corporate
examples of their use. A key steps towards establishing such a code is
to have it endorsed by the chairman and chief executive, and all staff
should be given an opportunity to respond to its content.
Regular review and updating is vital if it is to remain relevant to
changing times and circumstances. Businesses that have overseas
subsidiaries are urged to ensure it is translated for use in places
where English is not the principal language.
Body Shop has blazed a trail on the issue of corporate responsibility
and ethical behaviour, with a high profile taken by founder and chief
executive Anita Roddick. It was one of the first companies to publish an
environmental statement and has campaigned vigorously on a range of
social issues both at home and abroad.
While it would be unrealistic to expect many other companies to mirror
its actions, there is an increasing awareness among companies of the
need to be socially responsible, whether in environmental areas,
employment practices or equal opportunites.
Esso is among the larger companies trying to take the issue of ethics
seriously, and is one of the examples cited in the IBE report. It has
had a business ethics policy in written form since 1975.
Chairman Keith Taylor says the company's key objective is to achieve
the best operating and financial results possible, ''but the way in
which we achieve them is as important as the results themselves if we
are to sustain that success in the long term''.
He emphasises that the group's core values such as integrity, honesty,
fairness and individual responsibility -- often beyond simply complying
with the law -- are the cornerstones of its business.
All new employees are given a copy of its Standards of Business
Conduct. Each year they are required to sign statements to confirm their
acceptance of the company's conflicts of interest and business ethics
policies.
Having a code and applying business ethics makes not just social but
business sense. The growing customer numbers and increasing
profitability of the likes of Body Shop and Co-op Bank are testament to
that.

COACHBUILDING
SCOTTISH coachbuilder Walter Alexander has been boosted by #9m of
export orders from Ireland and Hong Kong over the last week.
The Falkirk-based company has sold 50 hi-tech double-decker buses to
Hong Kong for #5m, within days of clinching a #4m order for 70
double-decker bus bodies from Dublin Bus in Ireland.
Dublin Bus already operates a fleet of 250 Alexander buses and the
latest additions to its fleet will be built at the latter's Belfast
factory.
All the buses for the Hong Kong order will be built in Scotland
''because the customer insisted he wanted Scots expertise'', the firm
said.
They will offer airline-style first-class luxury, with air
conditioning.
Lyndon Rees, Hong Kong Citybus managing director, said: ''Passenger
expectations are higher than they used to be. People are leading more
comfortable lives and expect to maintain that level of comfort when they
travel by bus.''
Some 80% of the company's 500-strong fleet were built by Walter
Alexander.
Hong Kong Citybus is pioneering the introduction of smart-card
technology to create an integrated payment system covering ferries,
underground trains and other modes of transport using a single card.
Ian Galloway, chief executive of Walter Alexander, which was acquired
by the Mayflower Corporation in August, said: ''This is a prestige order
from a prestige client, and winning it is a testament to the quality of
our product and the skill of our workforce.''
The picture shows (from left) Samuel Cheng of Hong Kong Citybus,

FOOD RETAILING
SAFEWAY yesterday announced the extension of its ABC loyalty card
scheme to all its 365 stores on October 23. The move comes just two
weeks after Tesco announced a rise in interim profits of 16%, with its
Clubcard scheme taking a lot of the credit.
The new ABC card will give customers one point for each pound they
spend. These points can either be redeemed for a straightforward 1%
discount, or for special offers such as free luxury items, free Safeway
dry cleaning or car washes, or money-off vouchers for days out, holidays
and cinema tickets.
The launch is costing #7m and Safeway will need a 2%-3% rise in sales
to cover its investment.
Safeway's old ABC scheme was a basic points-for-discount card,
available in 130 stores on a selective marketing basis. The new, complex
scheme has been shaped by extensive market research, where customers
stated they wanted to choose how to use their points.
The type of incentives on offer -- Mr Blobby cakes, cartoon videos --
is in line with Safeway's desire to target families with young children,
a high-spending group of customers. Harry, Safeway's cute kid consumer,
will be advertising the expanded scheme.
Tesco, which has 14% of the Scottish grocery market, launched its
Clubcard in February, offering a straightforward 1% discount, with a
minimum spend of #10. Since taking over Wm Low it has achieved
remarkable growth, likely to be 19% this year.
Safeway, which, including its Presto stores, has 22.1% of the Scottish
market, is counting on this more sophisticated card system to maintain
and improve its market share.
Asda is testing a variety of different loyalty cards in 16 Scottish
branches, with no immediate plans for a nationwide scheme. Sainsbury,
with only four stores in Scotland, is assessing a Saver Card is on a
six-month test in 112 of its 356 English stores.

MEDIA
NEWS Corporation should maintain profit levels for this financial year
despite big increases in newsprint costs, chairman and chief executive
Rupert Murdoch said yesterday.
However, he forecast a loss of about #50m for his media empire's
pan-Asian satellite broadcast service Star TV, reports the Associated
Press.
Mr Murdoch made the comments at an annual meeting of shareholders of
the newspaper, film, television and publishing conglomerate in Adelaide,
Australia, where he started his worldwide group in the 1950s.
''We believe our profit levels will be at least maintained,'' Mr
Murdoch said of the current year to June 30, 1996.
News Corp earned a profit after tax of #638m in the year which ended
on June 30, 1995.
''We expect to see at least another 10% increase in paper costs over
the next 12 months,'' said Mr Murdoch, whose UK interests include The
Sun, The Times, the News of the World and a major stake in Sky TV.
''Paper costs are a worry and it is going to be some time before this
turns around, I believe. Advertising is strong and everywhere we're on
budget or ahead.''
Despite rising production costs, he said News Corp's newspapers in
Britain should boost earnings for the group given the company's focus on
costs and increasing competitiveness.
''We have great faith in our newspaper position in Britain. We see
growing profits in Britain if we increase our share of the market and
manage to get even more competitive and even more efficient,'' he said.
Mr Murdoch defended the performance of Star TV, which beams into Asian
countries, many with booming economies and a fast growing number of
middle-class consumers.
''We don't call them losses, we call them investments,'' he said. ''We
see this as a major development and the only question I've had from
investment managers is that we're not going fast enough.''
Mr Murdoch said he had no immediate plans for a further increase in
the cover price at The Times following a 5p lift to 25p in late June.
''We hope not to raise it further for some time,'' he said.
He added that he had no plans to acquire more papers. ''I don't see us
buying more newspapers,'' he told reporters after the shareholders'
meeting. ''That's not to say we won't, but I don't see it.''
Although cautioning that ''no-one has yet worked out how to make any
profits'' from delivering news through on-line computer services, he
said all of News Corp newspapers would be available to Internet users
next year.
''I expect that by this time next year all our newspapers, and
certainly all their classified advertising, will be on-line to anybody
with a computer and available through the Internet.''
His British newspaper titles were ''thriving,'' he said, with daily
circulation at The Times at 700,000 copies and The Sun four million, at
least 1.5 million ahead of its nearest rival.
Circulation at The Sunday Times stood between 1.27 million and 1.35
million a week and was ''totally dominant in its market''.

BSkyB chief executive Sam Chisholm received a pay package totalling
#4,716,000 last year compared with #665,000 in the year to June 1994.
The latest payment includes a bonus of #2.7m for bringing the formerly
Murdoch controlled broadcaster to the market last December at a price of
264p per share.
Mr Chisholm also has rights to just over 3.31 million shares which
would now yield him a profit of #1.62m based on last night's closing
price of 383[1/2]p.

SHARE prices on the UK stock market tumbled yesterday, initially on
early expectations that Wall Street would suffer after technology group
Motorola reported poor results and later when this proved to be the case
as US technology shares, the driving force behind the US equities
market, slumped.
But the UK slide, which sliced about #13bn off market values at one
stage and left the FTSE-100 Share Index down 50.2 at 3460.1, its largest
drop since November 1994, was largely on futures selling.
Most world stock markets retreated and although Wall Street had
recovered some ground later on and the UK was just off its bottom mark,
market tensions continue.
In the UK, additional factors at work included political jitters and
attendant economic worries. In currency markets the problems of the
French franc continued to be at the forefront, although activity was
quieter yesterday after Paris raised short-term interest rate.
Share markets at home have been boosted for some time by major bids
which have kept prices on the boil and a lack of any news on this front
may also have had something to do with the decline. Most traders were
keeping calm about the situation and endeavouring not to overdo
comparisons with previous years when share prices had suffered
substantial drops.
At one time Wall Street was down around 60 points before bouncing back
to show a fall of 34 points when the UK market closed.
Some analysts feel that the UK market is heading for further falls
with equities having become overvalued compared to government
securities. It is suggested that shares have too much built into them in
terms of expectations of growth, inflation, profits, and dividends.
Aside from nervousness about Wall Street's ability to come to terms
with the number of less than encouraging earnings data released
recently, domestic political considerations are playing an increasing
influence in market thinking.
This is scarcely surprising given the reduced majority of the
Government and the divisions within the Conservative Party. But doubts
about in which direction the economy is going also play a part.
Today could see shares on a recovery tack as is often the case after a
market plunge. But there are so many imponderables ahead that unless a
further spate of utility takeovers take up the slack, shares are likely
to stay volatile.

<HEADLINE>Takeover speculation rife in banking sector. Scots independents in spotlight</HEADLINE>

LLOYDS Bank's proposed merger with the TSB has raised question marks
over the future of Scotland's two remaining independent banks.
The shares of Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland both rose
yesterday in a falling market on speculation they could be next in line
for a friendly takeover.
But last night HSBC, the parent of Midland bank, denied persistent
rumours that it was about to spring a proposal.
''We would like to say formally no and we wish the two banks well in
their respective business,'' an HSBC spokeswoman said after the stock
market closed.
City analysts had seen HSBC as the most likely bank to bid for a
Scottish partner.
But they did not rule out friendly offers from Barclays or Natwest as
the drive towards consolidation in the UK banking industry intensifies.
Royal Bank of Scotland, with a market capitalisation of #3900m, is
seen as the most vulnerable to takeover. Its shares rose 9p to 493p
yesterday on bid speculation.
Bank of Scotland, with a market capitalisation of #2800m, is often
regarded as less vulnerable, mainly because Standard Life holds a 33%
blocking stake.
But analysts said either bank could fall into the embrace of a
friendly bid from a larger partner if the price was right.
Reflecting this sentiment, Bank of Scotland shares rose 3p to
243[1/2]p.
Scotland's third bank, Clydesdale, is already spoken for. It was
gobbled up by Midland Bank years ago and was sold on to National
Australia Bank, its present owner, in 1987.
Only an agreed bid for a Scottish bank could be successful since there
is no history of successful hostile bids in the banking sector. But
no-one is predicting any immediate developments.
''I think we could be talking about some time in the next year, not in
the next couple of months,'' said one London-based banking analyst who
asked not to be named.
Royal Bank of Scotland remains publicly hostile to the idea of any
merger which would see control pass out of its headquarters in St Andrew
Square in Edinburgh.
''Our board has always taken the view that we are best served by
remaining an independent financial services group managed from
Scotland,'' a spokesman said yesterday.
Privately, Royal Bank officials say the institution's strategic
alliance with Spain's Banco Santander would make an approach by any
other party very difficult.
Banco Santander, which is Spain's largest bank, owns 9.99% of the
Royal.
''It's a very strong alliance with one of Europe's largest banks and
we are very happy with that relationship,'' a Royal Bank official said.
Bank of Scotland is coy about its own attitude towards a potential
merger. ''We have no comment to make on the matter,'' a spokeswoman
said.
Richard Andrews at Bell Lawrie White in Edinburgh was sceptical about
the chances of a successful bid for either bank.
''Neither of them are lame ducks, whereas TSB had been seen as a
potential bid target for years,'' he noted.
Political factors might also deter a potential bidder. The tartan
lobby would protest loudly at any takeover of a Scottish bedrock
institution, raising concern across party lines.
And there is a very real threat of veto by the competition authorities
in London and Brussels. The European Commission blocked an attempt by
HSBC to buy Royal Bank back in 1981.
If Royal Bank and Bank of Scotland do remain independent with about 5%
of the UK market each, they may try to consolidate their position by
devouring smaller fry.
Both have expressed interest in acquiring a building society.
Foreign ventures are another way to seek growth outside the intensely
competitive UK banking market.
Royal Bank is well pleased with the performance of its Citizens
Financial Group in the US, where profits rose 80% to #49m in the first
half of this year.
Bank of Scotland is, meanwhile, in the process of acquiring 51% of
Australia's BankWest for #235m with a view to developing new business in
the emerging economies of the Pacific Rim.

GARDEN supplies group William Sinclair increased full-year taxable
profits by 13.4% to #4.73m on turnover 7.7% greater at #44.4m.
The results were helped by a better than expected contribution fromth
Zeneca peat business and the horticultural division now has the

The dividend total has been raised 6.3% to 7.6p.

THE popularity of the National Lottery coupled with the deregulation
of Sunday shopping in England and Wales had an adverse effect on the
sales and profitability of Lloyds Chemists' drugstore division.
This dragged down the performance of the group as a whole, forcing
annual profits 27.6% lower than last year at #42.2m before tax. However,
the dividend was raised for the ninth consecutive year.
The drugstore business made a loss of #3.7m, mostly in the second
half, on 7% lower sales of #83.3m. It is currently being reorganised at
an exceptional cost of #13.4m. Of the 308 units in the group, 133 have
been earmarked for closure with the loss of around 550 jobs.
Of these outlets, 25 have reopened under the Holland &amp; Barrett
healthfood logo, 75 have been taken by other tenants with 35 awaiting
disposal. The remaining 175 stores are to be remodelled as more upmarket
health and beauty stores. There are currently 20 of these open and
although it is early days yet the signs are said to be ''reasonably
encouraging''. It is expected to be 18 months before the programme is
completed.
Jonathan Fellows, finance director, emphasised that the drugstores
business was ''the only problem area'' in the group and it is being
tackled. Indeed, aside from the drugstore division, Lloyds Chemists'
other activities made record profits and are thought to possess growth
potential.
Holland &amp; Barrett occupies a specialist niche and has been largely
spared from the effects of the National Lottery, which has drawn money
away from some businesses. Holland's sales grew 7.3% on an underlying
basis with profits at a record #7.3m, up 43%. The business is the
subject of an intensive marketing campaign to raise brand awareness.
Lloyds Chemists intends to continue opening 50 shops a year to get to
its target of 500 Holland &amp; Barrett stores.
Lloyds Chemists' pharmaceutical wholesale business is number two to
Unichem. The acquisition of Daniel Pharmaceuticals in June last year
helped the division's profits to rise 24% to #16m.
The chemists shops continue to prosper reflecting higher NHS sales,
mirroring the growth in the overall healthcare sector. Over-the-counter
sales were static. Profits rose by 4.6% to #45.1m. The company itself
would admit that it still has a way to go to match the margins and
ambience of Boots the Chemists. The veterinary division, already the
market leader, increased profits by #400,000 to #3.9m.
The City is wary of retailers bearing bad news so Lloyds Chemists
shares were marked down 12p to 230p.

consider the defection in relation to Tony Blair's New Labour Party was
a curious one.
Was not this the same Jimmy Reid who earned ''loadsafmoney'' when
writing for an English-based tabloid with a Tory bias more ''blue'' than
that of Conservative Central Office?
Yet here he was on October 9 apparently defecting back to a more
left-wing cause. New Labour? New Jimmy Reid?

AS a brainless twit who had the honour to hold a commission in the
Black Watch during the Second World War, I enjoyed reading Jimy Reid's
article (October 9).
By coincidence, on that same day, I was glancing through an annotated
hide-bound copy of Etude sur la Psychologie de la Troupe et du
Commandment which is destined for the Black Watch museum in Perth in so
far as it was once the possession of Field Marshal Lord Wavell, Viceroy
of India, himself a Black Watch officer.
On page 93 the author, Commandant Gaucher, writing of junior officers,
remarks that they are often ''trop preoccupes du culte de leur moi'' --
too puffed up with their own self-importance.

<ARTICLETYPE>CORRESPONDENCE</ARTICLETYPE>
<RECORDNO>975945919</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
YOUR front-page article on October 10 about the Highlands and Islands
Enterprise Board is misleading in three material respects.
First, the STUC General Council did not ''block Mr Christie's
acceptance of the place on the HIE Board''. They did not do so because
there was no acceptance for them to block.
What they did do, as a General Council, was to decide that it would
not be appropriate for such an offer to be accepted if the offer was
made and that this message should be conveyed to the Secretary of State.
Secondly there is the suggestion in the article that I would have been
prepared to accept the position on the HIE board if that was the only
way to get a trade unionist on the board. That does not accurately
represent my position.
Trade unionists should be involved in public bodies because of the
day-to-day workplace experience they can bring to bear in dealing with
issues which come before the board. That experience does not rest
exclusively, or even mainly, with full-time or national trade-union
staff. Therefore simply appointing a national official to a board does
not meet the aspirations of the trade-union movement in respect of input
to these important decision-making bodies
Thirdly, I did not say that ''I put the issue to the General Council
in a neutral way''. I did not say that because I did not put anything on
this subject to the General Council. The issue was reported to the
General Council by the Chairperson who promised the Scottish Office he
would do so after a meeting with them earlier this week.
He was clear, as I was, that the Scottish Office suggestion raised
important issues for the STUC. It was therefore for the General Council
to determine a position -- not him, and not me.
The accurate position is:
(1) In early September, at the request of the Scottish Office, I
suggested some trade-union nominees from the Highlands for consideration
for membership of the HIE Board.
(2) The Secretary of State did not accept my suggestions and, in late
September, the Scottish Office indicated, if I would accept appointment,
an offer would be made.
(3) I said that for a number of reasons I did not think that it would
be appropriate for me to accept.
(4) The Scottish Office then wrote to me and said they would like to
discuss the position of trade-unions and public appointments, including
the HIE position, with the senior officer of the STUC.
(5) The Chairperson and myself met a senior Scottish Office official a
few days before our General Council meeting on October 4 and the
Chairperson agreed to report on the position to the General Council.
(6) The Chairperson reported to the General Council and the council
decided that for reasons of pressure of time, and for reasons of
principle, it would not be appropriate for the Secretary of State to
make the offer he had proposed. They also decided we should press for
the involvement, on the HIE Board, of a local trade-union person.
The issues involved in this case are important for the trade-union
movement and it is a pity that, because of the inaccuracies, the report
may have left the impression that I was in some way at odds with the
General Council. This is not the case. I was aware of what was at stake
and that is why I made it clear from the outset that it was a matter for
the General Council to decide.

I WAS interested to read your report about the Government-produced
statistic that the Scottish non-oil fiscal deficit for 1993-94 was
#8.1bn (October 10).
The Government claims to manage the economy. We have had Conservative
Governments for 33 years out of the last 50 and, of course, for all of
the last 16 years. I take it, therefore, that having produced this
figure, the Conservative Government is also prepared to take
responsibility for it.
It would appear that the production of the figure is intended to
frighten the electorate about any prospect of devolution, let alone
independence. The figure also, however, appears to justify a charge of
very serious economic mismanagement.
Are the people of Scotland, as equal partners in the UK, not entitled
to expect a better level of economic management than the Government
figure implies? The Conservative Government remains in power. What steps
will it take to improve a position which looks to be a serious
embarrassment to Scotland?

I REFER to your report on the possible merger of the TSB Group and
Lloyds Bank (October 10).
Because of the relative weakness of the TSB in England it was always a
possibility that the Chairman, Sir Nicholas Goodison, and his group
board would seek such a merger. TSB Scotland was a reluctant partner in
the group, because in Scotland the bank had built up a strong and
identifiable place in personal banking in which London and the
South-east was weak.
I write as the last General Manager of the West of Scotland TSB to
report that over four years I have challenged the TSB Group Chairman in
public at annual general meetings and in private by exchange of letters
on the danger of mergers especially as they would almost certainly be
detrimental to Scotland, even although they might strengthen England.
Sir Nicholas Goodison has consistently said that ''he begs to
differ''.
The board of TSB Scotland and its Chairman, Gordon Anderson, had also
received my proposals to quit the group and operate independently as TSB
Scotland with the return of its reserves and branches.
The loss of experienced managers and staff induced to accept
redundancy together with the loss of the unique Scottish on-line
computer system (replaced from England) will take time to make good but
it can be done, led by the Scottish chief executive.
My appeals to Ian Lang when Scottish Secretary were brushed aside.
Through all this The Herald has sensed the dangers to Scottish
banking.
Perhaps it is not too late for the Scottish board to resist any
further merger talks.

JIMMY Reid is wrong when he calls Tony Blair a Tory (October 9). If
Jimmy Reid, or anyone else, needs convincing just watch this week's Tory
conference to see the clear blue water that separates Tony Blair's
Labour Party from John Major's Conservative Party.
While the Tories praise Major for keeping Britain out of the European
Social Chapter, Labour is committed to its introduction and to
guaranteeing democratic rights in the workplace, including the
restoration of trade-union rights at GCHQ.
In all probability the Tories will link Labour's position of Europe to
our restated commitment to introduce a national minimum wage. The Tories
claim that both measures will make Britain uncompetitive; Labour
believes that they are essential to ending the scandal of poverty pay,
and to ensuring social and industrial democracy.
That chasm in analysis will be reflected in debates on education,
housing and the National Health Service. Then last, but by no means
least, there is the question of Scotland's parliament.
As a former General Secretary of the Scottish miners I am proud of the
NUM's consistent support for that key national and democratic reform. I
am prouder still, however, that it is now the overriding priority of a
united Scottish Labour movement, and that the next Prime Minister of
Britain, the much-maligned, Tony Blair, has repeatedly stated his
commitment to leglislating for a Scottish parliament within one year of
winning the General Election.
I don't know about Jimmy Reid, but I always thought that the purpose
of democratic politics was to persuade people, ie to make political
conversions. That is why I welcome Alan Howarth's decision to cross the
floor. Just as I welcomed another defection to Labour more than 20 years
ago when the lifelong communist Jimmy Reid joined the party.
Changing parties can never be an easy business, and I well remember
the first Scottish conference of the Labour Party following Jimmy Reid's
defection when I went out of my way to make him as welcome as I possibly
could in his new political home.
Sadly, that was not to be Jimmy Reid's last defection. It was followed
some years later by the abandonment of the ranks of the trade-union
movement for the blandishments of tabloid journalism. I will never
forget the Sun article in which he denounced the miners and their union
at a critical moment during the 1984/95 strike.
The Sun of all newspapers, the very same publication that walked all
over the printworkers. The newspaper with the twin-track, anti-Labour
editorial policy, supporting the Tories in the South and the SNP in
Scotland.
It is the homeless, the poor, the unemployed, the disabled, the old
and the ordinary that want Labour to win at the next General Election.
As former miners' leader representing a former mining area I want
justice for those former underground workers suffering from industrial
diseases. I also want to see justice for those former shipyard workers
suffering from asbestosis.
I well remember going to support shipyard workers back in those heady
days of the early 1970s and the historic UCS work-in. Almost quarter of
a century on and where are we now? I am flattered that Sammy Gilmour,
another of the UCS leaders, including my own name in the ranks of those
still in the trenches fighting for justice and democracy. But what about
the name of Jimmy Reid?
I defend the right of anyone in the Labour Party and wider movement to
be critical, as long as they are constructive with it. In his Herald
article on October 9, as on other occasions, Jimmy Reid went far beyond
such boundaries.

THE Howarth affair clearly illustrates that there are conviction
politicians and career politicians. Howarth falls into the latter
category, as a study of his career from his university days shows.
His comments about education policies are merely the smokescreen he
uses as the pretext of his reason to change to Labour. As Tony Benn
rightly pointed out, the honourable thing to do would have been to
resign his seat, otherwise, to use a good old Glasgow term, he is
nothing more than a ''chancer''.

MR Alan Howarth's defection to the Labour Party would not have been so
worrying a situation had he resigned.
By remaining in Parliament as a Labour MP, Mr Howarth is cheating his
22,000 electors. This surely is dishonest. How can Mr Howarth ever be
trusted again?
What is even more distressing for British politics is that Mr Blair,
along with his colleagues, is so willing to accept such a person into
his fold.

THE conservation movement is not as divided over the need to address
the control of ruddy ducks in the UK as Iain Gibson would have your
readers believe (October 2).
Ruddy ducks, introduced to waterfowl collections in the UK, escaped in
the 1950s and established a feral breeding population. Emigration from
Britain to continental Europe has led to colonisation of other
countries, including Spain, part of the range of the globally threatened
white-headed duck.
White-headed ducks have declined in number from over 100,000
individuals at the turn of the century to around 19,000 now. An
intensive and successful conservation programme has been implemented to
halt this decline by protecting white-headed duck habitat, stopping
hunting, and through re-introduction.
In the process, the white-headed duck has gained the kind of following
that osprey enjoys in Scotland as a symbol of conservation success.
This success is now at risk. Emigration of the introduced ruddy duck
from Britain has brought it into contact with white-headed duck. They
have inter-bred and produced fertile hybrids which the Spanish
authorities are now controlling.
Iain Gibson suggested that it was better to allow hybridisation to
continue unabated: the development of a super-species that was part
ruddy duck, part white-headed duck would result. But this is unlikely to
be the case.
Research into the interactions between the two species suggests that
ruddy duck, in time, will absorb the native white-headed duck
population, such that only ruddy duck remain.
This problem is not unique: in New Zealand, over a 20-year period,
introduced mallard have absorbed much of the native New Zealand grey
duck population through hybridisation.
So the basic question is clear: should be intervene to permit a
globally threatened species -- the white-headed duck -- to survive? The
RSPB believes the answer is yes, in common with the other 11
organisations of the UK ruddy duck working group.
If we do not seek to control the source of ruddy duck in the UK
control in Europe will soon cease to be feasible. Extinction of the
white-headed duck will follow.
Against the background, we have sought to explain to both public and
our membership why we believe it is necessary to test the feasibility of
ruddy duck control in the UK. Feedback suggests we have achieved wide
understanding of our position.

EX-TORY MP Alan Howarth's defection to Labour surely says it all about
Tony Blair and New Labour. How any self-respecting socialist can stay in
a party which so openly welcomes such an acknowledged right-winger, is
beyond me.
Yet what is not surprising is the glee with which the Labour
leadership greeted Mr Howarth's decision. After all, since becoming
Labour leader Tony Blair has diligently worked on out-Torying the
Tories, exorcising the very spirit of socialism from his New Labour
Party.
Labour activists in Scotland, if they still go by the name of
socialist, have now no other option but to join me and the thousands of
socialists like me in the ranks of the SNP.
British Labourism is dead, sacrificed on the altar of capitalism in an
attempt to woo the votes of ''Essex Man''. I appeal to the thousands of
genuine socialists in the Scottish Labour Party who must be gutted by
their leadership's betrayal, to join with their comrades in the SNP and
together let us build a Scotland we can be proud of.

Like a frenzy of basqueing sharks, the pornographers are fighting each
other for a share huge profits. Stephen McGinty looks at the likely
winners.
THE perceived wardrobe of pornographers remains the dirty mac. A
flasher's coat for the captains of a basement industry whose sleazy
publications are tucked on the top shelf. Yet at the launch last month
of Television X: The Fantasy Channel, executives of Portland Publishing
strolled round the conference suite at Bafta in finely cut suits and
leather loafers. The men from Penthouse, Asian Babes and Reader's Wives
smiled broadly at the girls.
The girls were squeezed into baby-doll basques, gold bikinis, tight
leather shorts, they were frequently topless. The arrival of Divine
Brown, the Hollywood prostitute arrested with Hugh Grant generated a
blizzard of newsprint publicity for the channel, available on cable this
month. It was also the first stiletto stab in a battle for the British
male viewer, branded the porn wars.
In November Playboy TV launches in Britain. Like The Fantasy Channel,
the signals will be encrypted, requiring users to purchase the necessary
smart cards which will allow them access to four hours' ''adult
entertainment'' from midnight until 4am. David Sullivan, the man behind
Sunday Sport, is to launch Babylon Blue in the near future in a bid to
catch the high ground and as many viewers as possible.
Virginia Bottomley has already threatened to ban smart-card sales
which allow viewers access to TV Erotica which still advertises itself
as ''Europe's hottest adult movie channel''. A similar ban was
successfully achieved during 1994 with Red Hot television which
consisted exclusively of hard-core porno-graphy. Yet the British-based
programmers have said they will abide by the ITC guidelines.
For the companies involved it is a further expansion in an industry
whose scale is staggering. Currently there are about 500 top-shelf
titles printed each month in Britain alone. Circulation is difficult to
gauge as few titles release figures, but in 1991 Paul Raymond's titles
Club International, Escort and Men Only were each selling more than
200,000 copies, with Mayfair selling 330,000. It is known that figures
have since dropped sharply.
Yet riches remain to be made. Paul Raymond was named Britain's richest
man after research revealed the true extent of his profits from
pornography and Soho property. David Sullivan's salary in 1990 was
#1,100,720. In comparison, Lord Raynor of Marks and Spencers earned
#620,000 in the same year. Money has always earned respectability. Paul
Raymond, in the past, has attended a Downing Street drinks party.
Her Royal Highness, Princess Anne, opened the Docklands headquarters
of Northern &amp; Shell -- the parent company of Portland Publishing
responsible for Penthouse, Forum etc. But the profits from pornography
trickle down to hundreds of other less visible companies. Hunterprint in
Northhampton have printed Paul Raymond's magazines and also Mizz and
Rupert Murdoch's New Woman. Raymond titles have been distributed by
COMAG, a subsidiary of Conde Nast and National Magazine, who publish
titles such as Vogue, Tatler and Cosmopolitan.
An estimated 2.25m copies of top-shelf magazines are sold every month
with industry profits pushing #20m a year. The reason for porn's
profitability is the distinct lack of production values. Editors will
quibble about it being described as ''nasty'' but it is certainly cheap.
Models are paid surprisingly little.
Deric Botham, managing editor of Penthouse, Black and Blue and Asian
Babes, said: ''Of the last 30 girls we used, only five were in full-time
employment. Fifteen were long-term unemployed. Three were single parents
and the remaining seven were in the low-wage category. Don't get me
wrong. I'm delighted at the situation. I hated having to worry about
finding enough material to fill a magazine.''
In his London flat, Sam, a photographer with experience in the
industry, said girls received #100 to #150 per day. The photographers
pay for studio time and processing, receiving about #1000 for each set
of prints. The shoot is often organised in stages with harder shots
organised for the markets in America and Europe. Some girls take an
ecstasy tab before filming, but many are exhibitionists, he feels, with
disturbed pasts.
Flicking through the pages of an American edition of Club
International to illustrate his work, he said: ''I'd say about 85% of
the women you find modelling in porno mags were abused when they were
children. Some don't actually have sex. They're too screwed up. The
average girl in the street is probably a lot sexier.''
As sales of men's magazines are beginning to drop with the rise in
sales of soft-core videos and more raunchy Hollywood movies such as
Basic Instinct and Showgirls, top-shelf magazines have become harder in
content. Newsagent chains such as W H Smith and John Menzies now refuse
to stock the extreme material featuring couples.
There has also been a backlash against heavy-handed distributers who
were threatened with court action by Egyptian newsagent Hamdy Shahein
after they continued to send top-shelf material after he had refused to
sell it. He has since formed an association of porn-free newsagents.
There is only one Scottish member.
When the phone-sex market collapsed in 1994 it was under the weight of
Government legislation which prohibited lines from being advertised in
tabloid newspapers and restricted them to top-shelf publications. Before
this, business was booming. Forty-five million calls were made each
year, with customers spending an estimated #35m.
However, since July 1994 when BT required an opt-in service and the
use of a pin-number to access such lines, calls have dropped from 61,000
a day prior to the action to just 2000 a day. Yet there remains 650
lines available, the majority of which are owned by magazine companies.
Stronger lines continue to evade ICSTIS control, running from Chile and
Hong Kong at standard international rates.
The backers of the new adult entertainment stations say terrestrial
broadcasting has paved the way for stronger material. Programme slots
such as The Red Light Zone are held as evidence, plus the popularity of
tapes such as The Lover's Guide. It remains to be seen how many will
tune in.
Geoff Baines, of What Satellite, said: ''There is a market for
pornography in Europe and in the UK and as long as there is a market
there will be channels trying to satisfy that market and the only thing
the UK Government can do is scratch the surface. The technology has
moved on and the law is left behind as is so often the case.''

ANVAR KHAN meets a hardcore performer and speaks to an ordinary man
who uses pornographic material.
THERE is nothing remarkable about Suzanne Sun's life, except that she
sleeps with a few men, at the same time, for money, in front of a
camera. She is not a prostitute, but could be by the nature of what she
does. For if there can be some kind of hierarchy among those who devote
their lives to the servicing of someone else's, even if only for a few
minutes, often for only a few minutes, the porn star is on top.
Porn stars take themselves very seriously. They do not align their job
with that of a street-working girl. She gets Aids. They diet and work
out. She sleeps with ugly strangers. They have sex with Baywatch extras.
Where's the comparison?
''You don't make that much money taking your clothes off for the
camera,'' Ms Sun, 34, says over the phone. ''And you only work maybe two
days a week at the beginning. But then someone might see your work and
offer you other parts in films abroad, which is what happened to me.
''Models can't get work in Britain because there is no industry. I
basically work between Holland and Germany. At first I was paid maybe
#200 per day of filming. It's exhausting work. Now I get #500 a shoot
and can work four days a week.''
It's not easy interviewing a Hard Core Porn Queen. I find myself
asking her how much she spends on moisturiser rather than how she can
live with herself. (She doesn't know how much she spends on beauty
treatments.)
Suzanne Sun is married. Her husband is a barrister. Her social circle,
made up of professional men and their wives, thinks that what she does
is ''a hoot''. But if two day's work is exhausting, how's four?
''I keep fit, I go to the gym, I take saunas and go to aerobic
classes. Models must feel 100% or they don't work. You might give
someone the flu or be carrying another non-sexual infection which might
put them out of work too.
''Porn stars look after their bodies, more so than most other women.
It is your body which is always on show. It is your body men, or other
women, fantasise about. You can't let yourself go.''
Beautiful or not, any body is more a prefab than a temple. Like a porn
career, it's not built to last. In Suzanne's continent, sex is an
adult's means of showing off and having fun. Once sex is no longer
understood as a precious romantic expression, it's not so much a
commodity as an acting part.
It is difficult to say what quality of relationship a man and a woman
can have, based on this dynamic. It would be fair to say that love
doesn't come into it. I've never met a guy, hypocrite or not, who, if he
cared about a girl, could stand any other man even trying to touch her.
''My husband and I have always had a sex life where we experiment,''
Suzanne says. ''I saw pictures of women in my husband's pornographic
magazines and thought, 'I could do that'.
''I enjoy my work. I've met so many different people and I've
travelled. The money also gives me independence. My husband is rather
proud of what I do. He doesn't mind the fact that I have sexual
intercourse with other men. I think he gets quite a kick out of it.''
Colin Franks talks about the effects of porn on his life.
THE first time Colin Franks watched a pornographic video he was 15, at
a party and tanked up with Martini Cinzano. His host had secretly
''borrowed'' the tape from his father.
''The sex was as we'd imagined it, with women being available and
willing, and guys being able to have who they wanted and when,'' he
says. Colin, now 28, became an accountant, got married and had two kids.
He is now divorced. He used pornography throughout the demise of his
relationship.
''I used to sit up watching the porn channel on Sky TV when she went
to bed,'' he said. ''We never had a good sex life. My ex-wife was very
inhibited, and we couldn't talk about our problems.
''I never played around during our marriage. I don't know why, and I
hesitate to say that my access to porn had something to do with that. I
actually never looked at other women. There's no point in having
affairs. I never met anyone I wanted to have one with anyway.
''My wife didn't like me watching pornography. She'd make comments
about the women having silicon injections to make their breasts bigger,
as if I didn't know that the whole scenario was a fantasy, that it
wasn't real. She thought any sex on TV was 'disgusting'. To tell you the
truth, I used to put it on to annoy her.''
Documentaries, soap-operas, even pornography gets boring to watch
after a while. The point about sex is that it's supposed to be more fun
taking part.
But not everyone has that option. ''I got my kicks, so to speak, from
porn at that time. Basically, I went to bed thinking about someone else,
a situation other than the one I was in. It aroused me, but porn is no
real substitute for desiring someone.''
Pornography doesn't seem to affect how men see women, but merely
reinforces what they think they like.
''American or Swedish women in porn movies are more natural-looking
and tanned, more healthy. More clean,'' Colin said.
''The women in pornographic magazines are usually dressed up in
bog-standard stockings and suspenders, with heavy make-up. They look a
bit desperate. Like tarts. And they have strange expressions on their
faces, like they're trying to fake pleasure. I like a bit of action, a
storyline. It's more fun watching people actually doing it.
''I'm not a sicko, I'm just an ordinary man. If I took a load of
videos or magazines into work, my colleagues would all want to see them
for a laugh. But men know the difference between a female porn star and
an ordinary woman.
''They may not like it, but they do.''
Names have been changed.

BOSSES at Hydro-Electric were delighted yesterday to have won a
prestigious #6m contract from ScottishPower, writes LACHIE KENNEDY.
Perth-based Hydro-Electric captured three of Scotland's prime tourist
sites -- Edinburgh and Stirling castles and Holyrood Palace.
It also took hundreds of prisoners in the power battle, clinching
contracts to supply electricity to Glasgow's Barlinnie and Edinburgh's
Saughton prisons.
Other public buildings which are now being powered by HE include
courts, museums, registrar's offices and the Scottish Records Office.
The new deal, which came into operation at the beginning of this
month, was won in the battlefield of tendering.
ScottishPower yesterday adopted a nonchalant attitude to the defeat. A
spokesman said: ''We are disappointed. But this is what competition is
all about. It is a question of some you win, some you lose.''
He added: ''Despite this disappointment we are still maintaining 95%
of our contracts.''
Richard Seddon, Hydro-Electric's energy sales manager, said: ''We are
immensely proud to have gained such high calibre customers. Our
reputation for excellent customer service, and our ability to tailor
contracts which suit customers at competitive prices, is attracting
companies nationwide.''
Customers who use in excess of 100 kilowatts can now shop around for
the best deal possible.

One of Glasgow's great controversies may be resolved today when the
city council holds a planning hearing on proposals for the M74
extension. At the centre of the row is Strathclyde roads and
transportation chairman, Councillor Charles Gordon. John MacCalman,
Municipal Correspondent, profiles the man whose revolutionary philosophy
of his youth has been transformed into a mature pragmatism.
STRATHCLYDE region's roads and transportation chairman, Mr Charles
Gordon, is painfully aware of the fact that stunts can often rebound.
However, the 44-year-old Drumchapel councillor, well used to being the
recipient of abusive telephone calls from the strident anti-roads lobby,
was utterly dismayed when a stunt created by a public relations
consultant, in which he wore a cowboy hat and six-guns, impinged upon
his family.
Earlier this year, he had opened part of the Goodyear site in his
Drumchapel ward, called the Great Western Retail Park, wearing said hat
and guns and was duly photographed.
Two days before polling day in the unitary elections last April, M77
protesters came over to Drumchapel from the Pollok Estate site during
the night and fixed posters featuring the ''Wild West'' picture on every
lamp-post in the ward.
The fun picture was accompanied by various unflattering captions,
including: ''Charlie Gordon is a rootin', tootin', pollutin' cowboy.''
Another questioned the councillor's truthfulness.
What was particularly upsetting was that the posters were on the route
taken by his two sons to school.
Councillor Gordon said: ''My sons were pretty upset about that. I'm in
public life. I'm there to be shot at. But the fact that my two sons were
upset made me bloody angry.''
It was a time of tremendous pressure for Mr Gordon. Hardly a day
passed but he received hostile letters and telephone calls about the
M77.
Even in his social life he could not go anywhere without people
asking: ''What about this M77 then?''
Such are the burdens of office for a roads and transportation chairman
whose council is pressing ahead not only with the M77 Ayr Road route but
with the equally controversial M74 extension which will provide the
final #250m link in Glasgow's motorway system.
A planning inquiry into the M74 extension takes place in the City
Halls today.
The project illustrates Mr Gordon's pragmatic approach to major issues
-- a pragmatism which flowered despite the revolutionary ferment of his
early years in the sixties when a large section of British youth were
attempting to reform the world order.
In other words, Mr Gordon, like many of his generation, has taken a
political journey.
Ironically, that journey brought him into early contact with the M74
project when, as a Gorbals councillor in the late eighties, he managed
to get the line of the route changed to prevent the loss of many
residential properties.
Indeed, the line he managed to have established -- running adjacent to
the railway -- is the line which applies today.
He explained: ''I came to the view that if I just argued against the
fundamental principle, I might not be able to influence events. At a
very early stage, I settled into the profile of pragmatically trying to
deliver for my constituents, whether or not it was regarded as
ideologically sound.''
That was his first brush with transport issues and it was then he
found his niche. He was doing a job he enjoyed and one in which he felt
he could be effective.
However, his sense of having found his calling came after much turmoil
in his early life when far-left politics were his passion and formal
education seemed to get in the way.
He was born and brought up in Partick, the youngest of a family of
seven sons. Early promise led to a place at St Mungo's Academy, regarded
by some as the cadet club of the Glasgow establishment, where he
developed a strong interest in debating.
However, the St Mungo years were not happy ones. Coming from a modest
social background, he felt that he never quite fitted in with the
school's ethos and left at the age of fifteen.
It was while taking a pre-apprenticeship course at Anniesland College
that he got his hands on a copy of Tariq Ali's newspaper, The Black
Dwarf, and quickly became involved in far-left politics, mainly with the
International Marxist Group.
He disclosed: ''I think a lot of people of my generation thought the
revolution was just around the corner.
''We were disgusted by the Labour Government's support for the
Americans in Vietnam and also by the industrial relations policy, In
Place of Strife.''
The new social scene whetted his appetite for education and after
gaining the requisite Ordinary and Higher Grades at Langside College and
nightschool he entered the University of Strathclyde in 1972, taking a
course covering sociology, economic history, politics, philosphy, and
pure economics.
Not surprisingly, he became involved in left-wing politics on the
campus, joining the Socialist Society.
At the end of his first year, although he had achieved distinction in
economic history, he found himself carrying two re-sits in philosophy
and economics. This, combined with falling in love, led to him quitting
university.
Joining the railway as a ticket collector/booking clerk opened up
opportunities for political activity in the NUR. In fact, he led two
unofficial strikes in the early eighties, one issue being station
de-staffing which had been instigated by Strathclyde Region.
After a flirtation with Mr Jim Sillars's Scottish Labour Party, he
finally joined the Labour Party in the late seventies, becoming involved
with the Bennites and the Labour Co-ordinating Committee.
However, he quickly concluded that the chronic problem with the
British left was factionalism. He was dismayed that they put more energy
into fighting each other than in trying to change society.
At the suggestion of friends, he decided to become involved in local
government and was elected to a Gorbals ward in 1987.
Promotion came quickly for the erstwhile revolutionary. In 1990, he
was made vice-chairman of roads and transport under the redoubtable Mr
Malcolm Waugh, the man he was to depose four years later.
Councillor Gordon and his colleagues were forced to recognise it was
no longer tenable to cope with the rise in car ownership with
ever-increasing supply of road space. Car travel had to be managed.
He said: ''What we decided to do was re-evaluate all of the road
schemes to see how many of them were justified. And we've found, more so
than ever that the M74 extension is needed.''
He argued: ''Look at the motorway map and you can see the missing link
that has to be done. If the M74 link-up is completed, then I would argue
that a lot of the traffic doesn't need to come into the north- east of
Glasgow to cross the river. They could cross the river further out, with
less impact on the city centre.''
What does a former revolutionary think of the methods used by the
modern anti-roads protester?
He said: ''You've got to be very careful about people who say they are
going to take direct action to stop a council implementing a decison
that was agreed through the ballot box. That's very dangerous. Where do
you draw the line?''
He confessed: ''When I was a young man, I wanted to change the world.
Now I have lowered my sights. I want to makes things better for people.
''When we of the far left were rampaging about the streets, I wonder
whether we were all that interested in helping people?
''I think the ideas attracted us. Lenin found this. The people that
helped make the Russian Revolution were people who were hopeless at
running Russia as a country.''
Councillor Gordon has made his long march from flower power to the
realities of power.
Certainly, no-one can doubt he is living in the real world these days.

''I AM disappointed,'' wrote the Secretary of State for Scotland to
his Prime Minister, ''that both you and the Chancellor have reservations
about publishing the booklet I have had prepared and printed setting out
details of the Government's revenue and expenditure in Scotland.''
This leaked letter from March 3, 1992, did not make it clear what
reservations John and Norman actually had about Ian Lang's pre-election
wheeze. One hopes that they might have been troubled by the probity of
using Scottish Office resources to pump-prime a Tory propaganda
exercise.
However, what was devastatingly clear from the Lang letter was that
the operation was carried out at his explicit instruction and order and
for entirely political motives.
Thus Michael Forsyth's declaration that he had nothing to do with
Monday's latest dubious demarche from the Scottish Office Statistics
Department is more stomach-churning than mind-changing.
Meanwhile Doctor Rigg of the Scottish Office should reflect on the
contents of that leaked Lang letter before offering us any further pious
protestations that he and his colleagues had not been dragooned into
using public resources for political purposes.
I'm rather sad about it all. Not because of the contents of the
Scottish Office paper, which on close analysis cause problems for the
Tories, but because of this process of compromising Scottish Office
civil servants. My former colleagues now risk being held in the same
disrepute as those other impartial civil servants who have ''adjusted''
the unemployment figures 20 times over at ministerial behest.
What gives the propaganda game away is not just the timing of the
Scottish Office paper but its presentation. As a headline total an
estimate of Scottish borrowing of #8000m in 1993/1994 is presented
without adding oil revenues or privatisation receipts and without being
placed in its proper context of a United Kingdom deficit for the same
year which on the same basis was well over #50bn.
This invites comment such as from the Tories yesterday suggesting
there was a ''black hole'' in Scottish finances which would have to be
filled by the taxpayer given constitutional change.
The Hirst suggestion, if applied by Kenneth Clarke to the United
Kingdom deficit, would imply the equivalent of a basic income tax rise
of up to 30 pence in the pound.
Instead, the last two chancellors have raised taxes 20 times by the
equivalent of almost 10 pence on the basic rate. That is 20 tartan tax
rises over the period and every one of them supported by Michael Forsyth
and the rest of Scotland's Tory MPs. These tax rises, of course, have
had the effect of sharply reducing both the United Kingdom and the
Scottish borrowing requirements since 1993/94.
The Scottish Office figures for that year compare with an SNP estimate
for the current year of a #200m surplus for Scotland relative to the
rest of the United Kingdom. Remarkable as it seems, it is not difficult
to reconcile these two figures.
First, we can safely assume that the Chancellor will not be excluding
either oil revenues or privatisation proceeds from his Budget
presentation this November. Including them in the Scottish total takes
the deficit down to #6300m.
If you look hard enough at the Scottish Office document you will find
on page 29 the admission that the inclusion of oil takes the fiscal
deficit to 9.75% of Scottish Gross Domestic Product compared with 8.5%
for the UK as a whole, a comparison which hardly supports the headline
contention of a particular structural deficit problem in Scotland.
A few moments more work and the intimidating headline deficit figure
can be made to disappear altogether. Since the whole point of this
exercise is to work out who is subsidising whom, we should properly
remove the #4000m Scottish share of UK borrowing from the total leaving
but #2300m.
In addition the Scottish Office estimates are two years out of date
and since then oil revenues have again been on the increase, yielding
another #1000m into Scottish receipts for the current year, and us with
only #1300m to find to balance the Scottish books.
Here we come to the only points of disagreement of fact between the
Scottish Office and the SNP as opposed to arguments about presentation.
On the expenditure side the Scottish Office refuses to concede the
importance of ''unidentified spending'' which all research has
consistently shown to be dominated by the South-east of England.
For example the Scottish Office statisticians think we should be
charged our share of things like the #3500m of Foreign Office spending,
despite the fact that just about the only Foreign Office staffer in
Scotland is Malcolm Rifkind's chauffeur!
On the income side the Scottish Office relies on a ropey sample survey
to establish Scottish income tax revenues. Without any question this
presents a figure much smaller than would be justified by the empirical
evidence.
Take these points into account and the Scottish Office fiddle starts
to play a very different tune and the nasty #8000m deficit of two years
ago is transformed into a nice identifiable surplus for this year.
There is a funny side to the Scottish Office calculations. On a number
of issues they unwittingly shoot some favourite Tory foxes. For example,
for the first time we have official confirmation that Scots pay more per
capita in taxation than the rest of the United Kingdom.
This is something Scots businesses struggling with higher rate bills
and householders with council tax bandings have suspected for some
considerable time. Nevertheless, it is always useful to have
confirmation of the old adage that there are lies, damn lies, and Tory
statistics, even if you and I had to pay for the exercise which found it
out.

Dull and dangerous.
BILLED as the cleverest man to address the Conservative Party
conference this week, Mr Malcolm Rifkind began with a rather elementary
error. At some time in his legal or political career he must have been
told never to offer up hostages to fortune. Ignoring this wise advice he
referred to Harold Macmillan's judgment that Foreign Secretaries have a
difficult task with conference speeches in that they turn out to be
either dull or dangerous. Mr Rifkind duly provided the dull speech and
Mr Portillo, as we shall see later, contrived to be both dull and
dangerous. Mr Rifkind has been seeking an antidote to overzealous
propagation of things European, not that there is much danger of that in
the modern Tory party. His solution is to adopt the brainchild of
Euro-Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and to opt for a revived
transatlantic trade partnership. This has significant attractions for
both men. Sir Leon, whose remit is external economic relations, has
assembled a package of some 200 specific measures for strengthening ties
between the US and the EU. A number of European partners are deeply
suspicious. They might see Mr Rifkind as President Clinton's message
boy, and although this is unfair it is unfortunate that Mr Rifkind's
desire to reinforce our transatlantic links may leave his motives open
to question.
While a transatlantic free-trade area is an intriguing idea, although
hardly as attainable as Mr Rifkind appears to believe, those who have
laboured long and hard for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt) since 1947 might justifiably ask what it might achieve that they
have not achieved in the task of promoting free trade around the world.
It should also be remembered that as members of the EU we already belong
to the biggest trading block in the world and that these benefits might
more usefully be consolidated before a leap across the Atlantic is
proposed. On reflection, Mr Rifkind's espousal of a transatlantic
free-trade area should be seen for what it is at the moment; that is, an
elegant distraction from pressing but contentious European issues. On
Nato and its important role in our future it is difficult to fault the
Foreign Secretary. Blessedly, he did not resort to waving the
increasingly implausible ''special relationship'' with the United
States.
For sheer implausibility, with an unfortunately abusive edge, we had
to wait for Mr Portillo. His speech was eagerly awaited by those who had
voted him the darling of the conference last year. His friends who had
promoted it as a slashing rebuttal of Mr Blair, and his claque dotted
about the conference hall were determined to make it a success. It was,
if measured in minutes of standing applause, but in terms of content it
was not impressive and the delivery was strangely inept. His
announcement of a rapid long-range reaction force is difficult to assess
without concrete details, but his treatment of Europe was unfortunate in
the extreme. His message was that Europe will never control British
forces or tell us when to fight or not to fight. Well, there never was
any danger of that happening, even if the sensible plans for limited
pooling of European forces in certain limited circumstances are examined
minutely. British troops serving in Bosnia have already been led by
foreign officers. Is this so deplorable? It was his insulting, abusive
edge which grated most; details of the jibes can be read elsewhere in
this newspaper. He ended with a tasteless appropriation of the SAS
slogan for party political purposes. ''We dare, we will win.'' This was
neither decent knockabout nor serious policy. The Conservative Party
deserved better.

DOES John Major have a favourite poem, do we think? His predecessor
enjoyed a drop of Kipling, in part because the gaudier verses
invigorated her misconceptions concerning patriotism (''If you can keep
your job when all about you/ Are losing theirs and blaming it on you . .
.''); partly, you suspect, because her only other concession to
literature was Lord Archer, who is to spondees what Alan Howarth is to
spotting the obvious.
But Major? Does he turn to the Downing Street copy of Palgrave's
Treasury in the dark, small hours, muttering of cabbages and kings? It
is hard to believe. A literary bent (unlike every other variety) does
not distinguish our political class. If Major has a poem by heart,
chances are it is something profound by Pam Ayres.
Tony Blair, meanwhile, probably isn't as well up on revolutionary
verses honouring Nicaraguan desalination plants as once he was. Equally,
clauses concerning ''The banner bright, the symbol plain/ Of human right
and human gain'' have doubtless been revised by a party task force
delegated to find rhymes for ''sensible'' and ''conditions permitting''.
The Prince of Wales is keen on proper English, extolling it as a
priceless heritage item, like architraves and a job for life, mainly
because so few of his tribe actually speak the language. He thinks well
of Shakespeare, who thought well of kings (generally while bumping them
off) but the truth is that royals rarely inspire great poetry -- as Ted
Hughes, the Laureate, has demonstrated conclusively.
In fact, the best this column could come up with after extensive
research into poems about kings named Charles was Rochester's Impromptu
on Charles II: ''God bless our good and gracious King,/ Whose promise
none relies on;/ Who never said a foolish thing,/ Nor ever did a wise
one.''
Hardly the stuff for National Poetry Day.
Then again, just what is the stuff for National Poetry Day? Anyone
irritated by BBC announcers reciting doggerel in an effort to summon up
excitement for tomorrow's event can be forgiven for wondering. Is it
important for the nation, variously defined, to know what its favourite
poems are? If so, will the nation be able to stand the embarrassment
when it is realised that large numbers still think Roger McGough is a
poet?
BUT who gives a triolet? After the announcement of his Nobel Prize for
Literature Seamus Heaney was quoted to the effect that poetry is a moral
force, a kind of purgative for language, and hence for the mind. This is
true enough -- bigots seldom write great verses, and fascist poets can
be counted on the knuckles of one fist -- but it also explains why a
solitary art is no vehicle for a jamboree.
Poetry's intensity, verbal or emotional, makes for poor family
entertainment. Equally, it has no obvious practical use, even if you are
Michael Forsyth contemplating your majority ('For mony a heart thou hast
made sair/ That ne'er did wrang to thine or thee.'') Armies of
performing poets might be to hand -- stand-up comedy with couplets --
but that won't prevent National Poetry Day becoming another risible
heritage joke, another bit of Britishness to be embalmed.
''We'' are supposed to be good at literature, you see, though as with
football ''we'' look a sight less impressive when the Scots, Welsh, and
Irish are withdrawn from the side. The American imperium has spread the
word and the language, this mongrel English, is held to be our unique
selling point.
Foreigners may ignore us, but at least they understand what they are
ignoring.
Hence the lip service paid to lip music, and to literature in general.
It is a kind of dumb and literally ignorant patriotism, the sort that
produces recurring rows, in England at least, over the school curriculum
and ''our island story''. Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, Wordsworth,
Tennyson: without these, somehow, the young will fail to be properly
British, meaning properly English. It is language as a state of mind.
This makes life tough for real poets, most of whom enjoy tinkering
with words, some of whom have no useful contribution to make to the
preservation of English or England. What is national, on one day or all
days, about Sorley Maclean writing in Gaelic of ''Cornford and Julian
Bell/ and Garcia Lorca/ dead in Spain in the sacred cause . . .''; or
Linton Kwesi Johnson recording, in the voice of an old immigrant, that
''Inglan is a bitch''?
Even at its gentlest, poetry is adversarial, recalcitrant, and
dissident. It grows, as the Ulsterman Louis MacNeice wrote, from ''the
drunkenness of things being various''. Dead or dying it may be -- isn't
it always? -- but the last thing it needs is a chart show and a place in
the museum of Britain's unnatural history.

Malaga
DRIVER Roy Clarke, cleared of drug charges by a court in Malaga at the
weekend, faces parking charges of up to #10,000 for his lorry while he
spent 20 months in a Spanish prison awaiting trial.
Mr Clarke, 47, from Ewell, Surrey, was cleared of smuggling 2.5 tonnes
of hashish resin worth #35m hidden in drilling pipes he had been
contracted to take to Britain.
The bill shock came as Mr Clarke relaxed with his wife Virginia, 45,
in Marbella awaiting his official freedom.
His lawyer, Angel Llera, said: ''After Roy's arrest in February last
year the vehicle was taken to an official pound. The bill has mounted
daily -- possibly up to #10,000 or more.
''Much depends on the judges' formal written verdict, which we don't
expect for several days. This bill is monstrous in view of the fact that
Roy is not guilty.
''But one thing is certain, the officials at the pound will not let it
go until the matter is settled.''
Mr Clarke is still on provisional liberty until the official verdict.
He cannot leave Spain and has to report to the police twice a month.
The lawyer, who proved in court that Mr Clarke was the innocent victim
of a British drug gang, is to claim damages for the months spent in
custody.
The usual rate of compensation in Spain for false arrest is #50 a day.
That could mean a pay-out approaching #30,000 for Mr Clarke.

<HEADLINE>Case for priming the pump. Lack of confidence undermines construction industry</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WORRIES that the economic recovery remains as patchy as ever would
seem to be justified; and to the extent that that is so, the possibility
of a double dip in some sectors cannot be dismissed automatically. The
construction industry is a case in point since many participants, and
not just in house building, are encountering a lack of confidence which
is leading to continuing hesitancy in placing new orders. In
construction generally orders fell by 3% in the quarter which ended in
August. According to the Halifax building society there was another fall
in house prices during the same quarter, a movement which also affected
Scotland which has been remarkably resilient in avoiding the sort of
slump endured in the south. Groups directly affected have been putting
back their own estimates of an eventual recovery by as much as another
year. The lobbying at the Tory party conference for some sort of
governmental remedial action is intense. The question is to what extent
it should be heard?
The Government can do several things, modest enough in themselves but
capable of delivering a stimulus to the construction industry sufficient
to lift it, provided there is a concomitant improvement in public
confidence. This elusive element is as vital to construction as it is to
the retail trade, but is especially important in housing. There, even a
modest stimulus might do the trick but there seems little point in
recommending any return to more mortgage interest relief, or indeed
anything which would renew house-price inflation. A stable rather than
fast-growing housing market remains attractive and that would be
perfectly compatible with the withdrawal of the last remnant of stamp
duty on housing sales. At one stage the Government suspended the
operation of that tax and it did help the housing market. A permanent
change would not involve a great deal of lost revenue but it might just
deliver a timely push. So might a move to re-vitalise local authority
house building for rent, but especially the refurbishment of that part
of the municipally owned housing stock which is empty but unattractive
to would-be users because of its poor physical condition. The money for
that departure could come from the funds already possessed by local
authorities from privatised housing sales, but which are not considered
available for ordinary expenditure; an appropriate proportion could be
released.
Civil engineering project opportunities might seem harder to identify
but, if no new major road works should be attempted, there is a case for
upgrading single-track roads in areas of tourist attraction like the
West Highlands. That sort of project would be individually modest but
were the Government not enmeshed in toils of its own creation on the
railways it could also initiate the modernisation of the west coast line
and the electrification of many other Scottish routes which would
benefit from such improvement. Such projects need not be expected to be
completed in a single spasm but could be spread over a number of years,
which would if anything increase their appeal to the construction
industry which is used to thinking long term. The difficulty in
financing such projects is obvious when the Government feels constrained
by present levels of spending, never mind adding more. The fact remains
that these suggestions add up to pump priming and need not prove too
costly in any one financial year. The alternative seems to amount to
doing nothing. There is a risk that any new spending will add to a boost
already on its way from other sources, but the evidence for that is
still slight enough to be disregarded.

Paris
A ONE-DAY strike by five million French public sector workers today
brought railways, buses, underground trains, schools, post offices, and
state-owned firms to a near-standstill.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators took part in France's biggest
strike in almost a decade, in protest against the conservative
government's refusal to boost civil service pay next year.
In Paris, millions of commuters were forced to walk or cycle to work,
or spend hours in traffic jams, as public transport was cut to a
skeleton service. Swarms of young Parisians took to their roller-skates.
Traffic jams snarled up the morning rush-hour, with motorways into the
city clogged for up to nine miles. Four of the 15 Metro underground
lines in the capital were closed. Rubbish piled up on pavements as
dustmen joined the strike.
The ''Black Tuesday'' walkout was intended to challenge the austerity
policies of Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who has already been buffeted by
a falling franc, plummeting popularity, and a housing scandal.
Across France an average of 70% of teachers stayed away from schools.
In Brittany up to 90% of teachers joined the strike, as did
three-quarters of railway staff.
''Today is a warning shot,'' said Nicole Notat, leader of the CFDT
union, as she joined a Paris march.
Asked whether unions would hold more strikes in the coming months, she
said they would be ''vigilant'' and might take to the streets in protest
against a planned overhaul of the welfare state, another important plank
in Juppe's austerity platform.
Demonstrations also took place in more than 80 other towns. In Juppe's
adopted base at Bordeaux, about 8000 demonstrators marched past his
mayoral office.
Rail travellers were among the hardest hit. The SNCF railway network
said one out of four trains were cancelled on the high-speed TGV service
and two out of three cancelled on other main lines.
Seven out of 10 Eurostar Paris-London trains were running but
cross-Channel and Marseilles-Corsica ferries were disrupted.
Dozens of international and domestic flights were cancelled as air
traffic controllers in Provence joined the strike.
The state gas and electricity company, car maker Renault, France
Telecom, the Post Office, and social security offices were also hit and
hospitals provided only a minimum service.
Juppe, whose government refuses to compromise, is keen to show unions
and financial markets that he is determined to cut the public sector
deficit and rein in government spending.--Reuter.

Rabat
A MOROCCAN policeman who murdered two British tourists in Tangier
killed himself as police prepared to storm his hideout, the British
Embassy in Rabat confirmed today.
Mustapha Hamouch, 37, had been in a drug den six miles from Tangier
surrounded by police since Sunday. The cocaine-using killer was with
friends from the local drugs mafia.
He had run amok in the Hotel Tarik in Tangier after shooting his wife.
He killed Martin and Margaret Gower, of Ruislip, west London, and
wounded several other tourists.
Police traced him on Sunday night. Squads of officers surrounded the
building and requested private ambulances for any casualties.
Shortly after 11pm yesterday the siege commander ordered smoke and CS
grenades to be fired into the building. Minutes later, they heard a shot
and burst in to find Hamouch dead.
Local sources said the policeman believed his wife had gone to the
Hotel Tarik to pick up men. After killing her, he went to the hotel with
his pistol and opened fire on tourist customers.
Searches at Hamouch's home revealed he had begun writing a book about
his life in which he said his wife was a prostitute and referring to the
disgrace he felt.
The officer is also known to have been an occasional cocaine user with
contacts among local drug barons. His own brother worked with the gangs
as a torturer and it was to the underworld he ran after the killings.
Mr and Mrs Gower were celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary when
they were gunned down. As Hamouch moved through the hotel, he shot
Charlene Barker, a 12-year-old Norfolk girl, in the hand. She played
dead and Hamouch moved on to attack others.
Charlene, who said she was ''really lucky'' to be alive, is due to
return home with her family tomorrow.
Mrs Patricia Sharratt, who was hit twice in the back during the
shooting, is serious but stable in a British hospital.

Frances Horsburgh considers the fears of the new unitary councils as
the Scots Secretary weighs expenditure options
THE turbulent transitional year of local government reorganisation is
half-way over. We've had ''Tory wipe-out at local elections'',
''Bogeyman Forsyth takes over at the Scottish Office'' and then ''Jobs
for the boys rows rock new councils''.
Recently we reported that the uneasy truce between the new Scottish
Secretary and council leaders appeared to be over. Battle was to
recommence. And now all eyes and minds are turning to the Budget, and
the warnings of impending financial disaster from council finance chiefs
have begun.
The Herald's Challenge of Change conference on November 2 in Edinburgh
is being staged less than a month before the new unitary councils learn
their financial fate for 1996-97. The first keynote speaker will be
Scottish Industry and Local Government Minister George Kynoch.
Some of the questions to be discussed at the conference will be: have
the transitional arrangements to the new unitary structure been fair and
equitable or are there outstanding problems which the new councils will
carry into their first year of existence, and how will they cope?
In the eyes of his political opponents the outcome of the Budget
process is a major test for the new Scottish Secretary.
Mark Irvine, head of local government in Scotland of the public
services union Unison, asks: ''Where does Michael Forsyth stand on the
question of resources? Are services to be sacrificed in a desperate
attempt to bring in Tory tax cuts before the next election?
''This year's Budget settlement is the real test. If Michael Forsyth
puts tax cuts before essential services the people we represent will be
the victims.''
In fact, it will be the whole Cabinet's final decisions on Budget
strategy which will initially affect the fortunes of the new councils.
Along with announcements about taxes and duty on spirits and tobacco,
the Chancellor's speech on November 28 will give an overall figure for
the level the Government believes councils in the UK should be spending
next year.
Scottish expenditure in all areas is calculated using the 10.66%
formula which Kenneth Clarke recently promised to honour. This amount
becomes the Scottish block which Forsyth can allocate according to need.
The slightest sign of any reductions in spending for such high-profile
areas as health and local government will be seized on by his political
enemies.
Last year, the then Scottish Secretary Ian Lang described a settlement
of more than #5300m in Government support for council spending as
''tight but realistic'' particularly in view of low levels of inflation.
The onus, he said, was now on local authorities to act sensibly in
setting their budgets and council tax levels. In the event, council tax
rose by an average of 7.5% to 8% and despite the usual dire warnings,
local services did not grind to a halt.
It was a vital local election year, however, and councils had a
special spur to keep the rises to a minimum. As a result, a total of
#140m of balances and reserves were used to keep bills down and to
balance the books and won't be available to the new authorities.
According to Cosla's depute secretary and finance expert, Albert Tait,
Government projections allow for a fall of about 1% in grant for next
year. This loss of grant is the equivalent of an 8% rise on the council
tax.
The Government is also insisting that for the third year in succession
councils will have to fund staff pay rises from ''efficiency savings''.
Cosla and the trade unions have fiercely attacked the policy, claiming
it will cost councils #216m during the period.
The convention's Labour president, Rosemary McKenna, puts it this way:
''We can't go on paring here, paring there. Local government is like a
plant. If you pare too much you kill it, but perhaps that is just what
this Government wants.''
In the months before the Budget a further problem of ''mismatchs'' has
been thrown up as a result of reorganisation. The mismatchs are the
differences between what is being spent on services in the areas of the
new councils and the amount of spending the Scottish Office believes
should qualify for grant support.
Larger city councils like Glasgow and Dundee have warned of the impact
on council tax levels and services of such shortfalls. But some smaller
councils have appeared unwilling to give up any monetary advantage they
may have gained to help the others.
There is also the on-going dispute between the Scottish Office and
Cosla over a call by councils for #10m to #15m in addition to the money
already allocated to pay for the transitional costs of reorganisation
this year.
In recent weeks Forsyth and his junior minister, Kynoch, have become
increasingly cool about such demands and have linked them to calls for
councils to behave more responsibly over job appointments and the
allocation of larger councillors' allowances.
In a recent letter to Ayr's Tory MP, Phil Gallie, the Scottish
Secretary suggested some of the new councils were appointing too many
highly-paid officials and said he was not prepared to make extra money
available until he was sure that it was fully justified.
And the next big financial row, it is being predicted, will be over
the Scottish Office demand that the new councils produce #30m of net
savings from reorganisation and, in particular, the merging of
administrative staffs. This week Cosla insisted such savings would be
non-existent.

ROBERT LUCAS of the United States won the 1995 Nobel economics prize
today for deciphering how people's expectations of the future effect
economies.
''Robert Lucas is the economist who has had the greatest influence on
macro-economic research since 1970,'' said the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences, citing his work on how ''rational expectations'' transform
economic analysis.
Lucas is the eighth Nobel economics laureate from the University of
Chicago, which has had more winners of the prize than any other
university in the world.
The Americans have produced 23 of 37 winners of the prize. Britain, in
second place, trails behind with six winners.--AP.

Allan Laing previews the opening episode of the latest series of
Cracker. You will not enjoy it, he promises, but you will watch it to
the end.
ON Monday night 15 million people, maybe more, will sit in front of
their television sets and watch the first episode of the last series of
an ITV drama -- and they won't know what has hit them. Cracker is back
with a vengeance.
The word ''controversial'' is a cliche over-used by every newspaper
which has ever passed judgment on plays, on films, and on books. But
Jimmy McGovern's series, built round Robbie Coltrane's desperately
flawed psychologist character Fitz, lives up to the name. Before the
credits roll on Monday's opening episode the complaints will cascade
down Granada Television's telephone lines. And among them will be the
Catholic church. For this is a tale which highlights religious
hypocrisy.
You want controversial? Even the scheduling of Monday's show is
controversial. For the first time ever an ITV drama series has forced
News At Ten back 15 minutes in order to accommodate this remarkable
opening episode. And, by so doing, it has incurred the wrath of the
Independent Television Commission. Cracker is out there on the
razor-sharp cutting edge -- and this time it has carved itself a
precedent.
Liverpool playwright McGovern, a nice man who clearly loves his
mother, has a heart as black as anthracite. How else could he produce a
storyline as warped and wonderful as this? It is designed to smack gobs.
He touches the deepest, darkest regions of our souls. It is no
coincidence that the entire drama is played out in the dead of night
with not a hint of daylight.
At the end of the last series Detective Sergeant Penhaligan (Geraldine
Somerville) had been brutally raped. The man she believed to have
committed the crime was her colleague, Jimmy Beck (Lorcan Cranitch). It
ended with the victim placing a pistol in the mouth of the villain. Was
the trigger pulled?
No! The new series opens four months on with Beck in a mental
hospital, recovering from a nervous breakdown. Penhaligan is back on
duty and Beck, her perceived nemesis, is ready to return to work. With
Fitz, they must investigate the awful bloody murder of a prostitute. A
man, a devout Catholic with a dutiful wife and four children, is placed
firmly in the frame.
But while the suspect is in custody identical crimes are committed.
When it is discovered that the DNA samples are the same, the finger of
suspicion turns to the man's brother, a Catholic priest. But the
dreadful truth is bizarre, so bizarre that McGovern is able to turn our
whole conception of the ''serial killer'' on its head.
The writer has declared that this story, entitled Brotherly Love, is
the last Cracker he will ever write. Another two stories will follow in
the series, written by other hands. It is a stunning exit, a profoundly
violent and genuinely terrifying thriller which plumbs the depths of
man's depravity.
Entertainment? No. It is more than that and different from that. You
will watch it compulsively. But enjoy it? That is not the word to use.
And, at the heart of this matter, stands Robbie Coltrane. Once famous
for being a comedian; now famous for being quite the opposite. Is this
the last we will see of Fitz?
Speaking in London yesterday, he said: ''Well, my commitment was
always to three series and that would be it. Each series does take up a
year of your life.''
So that is it? Fitz is dead? ''No. He's too good a character to kill
off. I'm quite happy to think about doing the occasional special. We
have discussed it and we are going to do one which is set in Hong Kong.
That is a very exciting place and it may not be possible to make films
there forever. We might do other specials as and when there is a time
window -- and a good story.
Brotherly Love does touch deeply -- and uncomfortably -- upon
Catholicism. At one point, for example, Fitz suggests that a Catholic
would find more guilt in the sin of being with a prostitute than he
would in the sin of taking another human's life. McGovern, of course, is
no stranger to the subject of religion, having scripted the movie
Priest, which also fell foul of the Catholic church.
Does Coltrane think that Cracker is anti-Catholic? ''I wouldn't say it
is particularly anti-Catholic, but like a lot of Jimmy's work it does go
in and out of confession and the trust you place in priests. But I think
the Catholic church has enough going on in real life without worrying
about a TV show.''
Mary Whitehouse, however, is another matter altogether. There seems
little doubt that Brotherly Love is the most shocking Cracker to date.
So would Coltrane be surprised if Mary Whitehouse wasn't on the phone
after episode one?
''I think Mary would be quite unhappy if she didn't have something to
do on the telephone every day. Now, if she took up motor racing -- that
would be surprising,'' he adds.
Cracker, which has received no less than 26 prestigous awards
including a barrowload of BAFTAS, has a reputation for violence. Does
Coltrane accept that it is sometimes too much for common decency and
good taste?
''I am quite prepared to address criticism because, if it's valid, it
has to be addressed. But the bottom line is do people watch the violence
and think 'That's a good idea; I'll have to go out and hit someone with
a brick.' But they don't. We do discuss this kind of thing at great
length. It doesn't just happen,'' he explained.
Coltrane has been genuinely surprised by the scale of the series's
success, and also admits candidly that, now that it's over, it will
leave an enormous gap in his life.
And what of the character Fitz? How does Coltrane regard him? ''Well,
I think most people find him interesting but they wouldn't want to share
a caravan with him. When I was known for comedy, people came up and
slapped me on the back and said 'How you doing'. But now they keep away
because they think I would pin them against the wall and analyse them. I
certainly get a quieter time in Sainsbury's.''
Will it be difficult for the actor to shed Fitz's skin? ''It's
possible,'' he admitted. ''But I don't know. I might do some comedy or I
might do something where I play a short, blond person. But I think the
public are pretty sharp and I don't think they really believe I am like
Fitz.
''It is the most constructive job I've ever done. It has taught me
more about acting than anything else I've been involved in. It has given
me a lot of media attention and, in terms of being taken seriously as an
actor, it has done more than anything.''
His final words on Cracker echoed the remarks he made last year when
he picked up his BAFTA award for the role. ''There is a huge hunger for
honest, intelligent drama which some people in the programmes department
would deny. They would rather have Celebrity Underpants or something.
And (Cracker's success) is good because there it is on paper that
viewers do watch things that people spend time and money on.''

Philadelphia
A TODDLER who crawled out of a third-floor window was caught by a
passer-by who seems to make a habit of being in the right place at the
right time.
Michael Springer, 45, broke Dante Barkley's fall seconds after turning
a Philadelphia street corner and looking up to see the 17-month-old
toddler dangling from the window, whimpering. The boy fell into
Springer's arms.
''It was all marble steps beneath the window. I can't imagine what
would have happened to him,'' Springer said.
In 1980, he comforted a man who was shot in a pool hall until
paramedics arrived. In 1989, he ran to a shooting victim's aid and held
the man until an ambulance arrived.
And when another man got stabbed last June, Springer said he placed a
cloth over the man's wound and kept him conscious until police came. All
three earlier victims also survived.
Police say Dante scaled the steps to the third floor of his parents'
house and climbed from a bed out of the open window. His parents,
Evaina, 23, and David, 25, each thought the other was watching the baby.
''We had just gone downstairs to watch television,'' said David.
''Then I heard someone hollering right outside our front door. He was
hollering, 'Baby, what are you doing? Baby, don't'.''
At first they thought was someone having a lovers' quarrel.
Dante was examined at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, but doctors
could not find a mark on him.--AP.

Srinagar
BRITISH hostages Keith Mangan and Paul Wells will mark their 100th day
in the hands of Kashmiri separatists tomorrow, as the approach of winter
pushes the deadlocked crisis into a new phase.
The hard-line Muslim Al-Faran group, which wants a Kashmiri state
independent of India and is demanding the release of jailed extremists,
has held the two Britons, an American, and a German in high mountain
pastures throughout the summer.
However, the nights are getting colder and Indian government sources
believe this will force the kidnappers to move their camp to a lower
altitude.
The health of the hostages is deteriorating under pressure from the
cold, a poor diet, unhygienic conditions, and the mental strain of their
ordeal, according to Indian police.
A source closely involved in the crisis said: ''The weather will force
them down into the areas where there is more population and military
activity, which will make it more difficult for them to continue with
this.
''Whether it will bring about a denouement we can't tell.''

OUR DIRECT transatlantic links have thinned of late, but one good
thing about the remaining service by British Airways from Glasgow to New
York is that it can almost get you to Manhattan for lunch. If they would
take off just half an hour earlier, you might be sure of starting to
nibble your arugula along with the locals.
In the event, I only just made it when I flew over last week, delayed
besides by the tail-end of Hurricane Opal. I had to rely on the good
graces of Sir Jack Shaw of the Bank of Scotland, whom I met on board on
his way to the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in
Washington. He offered me a lift to Fifth Avenue, which was frightfully
decent of him. He is far too nice to be a banker.
His driver turned out, like many drivers in New York, to be a Russian,
Yuri. He was also a fan of James Boswell, and had Boswell for the
Defence, a volume from Yale University Press's edition of the papers,
lying beside him. He was glad to hear we had just come from Scotland
because one thing puzzled him: was this the same Boswell as had married
Mary Queen of Scots and, if so, when would she appear in the book? I
dare say these nuances can elude someone used to Cyrillic transcription.
Discussion was cut short by the awesome spectacle as we crossed the
Queensboro Bridge over the East River. Dark, weeping clouds swirled
round the skyscrapers, which soared heavenwards to be lost from view
within them. It reminded me most of a storm in Glencoe, and it was
sobering to reflect that this sight was half made by Mammon, not solely
by God. New York, New York, it's a wonderful town.
By the time I reached my midtown hotel, it was the back of two. I had
been on the move for 12 hours and had expected to feel exhausted.
Instead I felt ravenous. My rule with jet lag is to do what my body
tells me to do. I know a little restaurant over on 62nd Street, the
Arcadia, run by a famous American cook, Anne Rosenzweig. There, through
the rain, I set out to eat.
But I had got no further than Park Avenue when I was halted. Six
ladies, dressed to kill in the usual Manhattanite fashion, pasted with
make-up, dripping with jewels, stood screaming at two policemen,
Officers O'Shaughnessy and Bernardini by their badges. They stared back,
impassive except for chomping jaws, from behind a barrier which blocked
the way over the road.
''My husband is dying on 59th Street, and these assholes won't let me
through,'' keened one of the harridans.
''Lady, da Pope'll be right along, any minute,'' was O'Shaughnessy's
amazing reply.
Yet it was true. I had arrived amid John Paul II's visit, and crossed
his path back from a suburban mass to the papal legation on the Upper
West Side. Swarms of outriders appeared, with the lads from NYPD, all
good Catholics, revving up their enormous motorbikes. Limo after
stretch-limo swept past, smoked-glass windows shut tight, though from
one a pudgy hand protruded sporting a huge episcopal ring. Suddenly came
another car bearing Old Glory and the Vatican flag, but it was gone
before you could even try to focus on what lurked inside.
''Guess dat was da Pope,'' ventured Bernardini, and O'Shaughnessy
wordlessly nodded. They drew back the barrier to let the women go. One
continued to rage at them. ''Lady, have a nice day,'' said
O'Shaughnessy. It's a wonderful town.
By now it was after 2.30. When I reached the Arcadia I had to raise my
voice and utter a few connected sentences: in this part of Manhattan a
British accent goes a long way. ''Of course, Sir,'' said the head
waiter, and led me to a table.
In fact other British accents seemed to be rising round me. To my left
an elderly gent was using one, phoney I soon decided, to work his evil
way with a young girl. To my right some swarthy creature opined: ''In
London even sons of good families go into business.'' What a meathead
(an insult I had just picked up on Park Avenue). It was more interesting
to watch an attractive but skinny lady religiously remove the croutons
from among her arugula.
American dietary habits were anyway not going to stop me. After a
plate of fried oysters, followed by one of monkfish, lentils, beetroot,
and sprouts, then by peach tart, all washed down with a bottle of Philip
Togni's Californian white, I was feeling, despite the large bill, quite
at home again in New York.
So, with the rain easing, a stroll down Madison Avenue seemed in
order. At 60th Street, in the sensation of the season, Calvin Klein has
just opened his main store. It is a dramatic if minimal edifice, rooms
20ft high, blank white walls, echoing sandstone floors. There appears to
be just one of each item, and none has a price tag. The semiotics of
this only came home to me later: if you have to ask the price, you
should not be here.
I picked out a couple of sports shirts, which surely could not be too
expensive. When I got the bill to sign they came to four times the most
outrageous price I had previously dared to imagine. If I had been a New
Yorker, I would have said at this point, ''No deal, buster''. But I am
polite and British, and could not bring my country into contempt. I
signed.
As I walked away, I pondered the fact that within three hours of
landing at JFK I had, if through a glass darkly, seen the Pope and, on
lunch and two sports shirts, spent somewhat more than the cost of my
return flight across the Atlantic. But what else is New York for? It's a
wonderful town.

Gaza
SCORES of Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails kissed the
ground today as they returned home to a tearful welcome.
At the same time, however, the PLO accused Israel of breaking a key
peace deal promise.
''This is a beautiful moment and a product of peace. I will never go
back to prison,'' said one man from Bethlehem as he was freed after 29
months in a prison in the West Bank city of Nablus.
Israeli police spokesman Eric Bar-Chen said that of more than 5000
prisoners held by Israel, 960 were being set free in a
confidence-building measure as part of the Palestinian self-rule deal
signed last month.
However the PLO said many political prisoners were refusing to go and
accused Israel of having broken a promise to free all the women being
held.
Those released said there were talks about whether or not the
political prisoners would agree to leave jail because Israel would not
free five women who, it says, have ''Jewish blood on their hands''.
''I am very happy to be released, but the slate is not cleared as long
as some of our brothers remain in jail,'' said a 26-year-old man who
kissed the ground as he crossed over the border into Gaza.
The atmosphere was less jubilant than 18 months ago, during the last
big prisoner release. This time many waiting Palestinians were not sure
their relatives would be freed from prison.
''I feel that something must be done for our brothers who were in the
same trench hole and fought for the same goals,'' said one ex-prisoner.
Meanwhile, Israel began its West Bank pullback, with Israeli officials
handing over a military occupation office to the PLO in the village of
Salfit in a token first step towards the army's redeployment after 28
years of occupation.
Hundreds of Palestinians chanted ''PLO -- Israel no'' and waved
Palestinian flags outside the civil administration building in the
village, 30 miles north of Jerusalem, while Israeli and PLO
representatives completed the handover inside.
''During eight years of intifada we waited for this day when we will
be rid of the soldiers,'' said a villager named Latif.
Under the accord, signed in Washington last month, Israel will pull
out troops from six West Bank cities and part of a seventh, and transfer
civilian authority in 450 villages, towns, and refugee camps to widen
Palestinian self-rule.
''I am happy the civil administration will leave Salfit on a one-way
ticket. I hope it will be a step forward for the implementation (of the
agreement),'' said Ahmed Fares, who signed for PLO head Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
David Barel, who as deputy head of the civil administration in the
West Bank signed for Israel, said: ''It's the beginning of the
redeployment of the civil administration in the West Bank.''

THE joint was brighter than I had imagined, even almost dinky in a
colourful Toys R Us kind of way, although its maze of red, blue, and
yellow corridors was lit by co-ordinating weak wattage bulbs which gave
off a dim, fuzzy light that pained the eyes. It was ruthlessly clean,
walls, banquettes, and staff all looked well scrubbed. But yet it had a
low-life atmosphere, an impression exacerbated by the fact that it was
situated in the very bowels of the city, reached only by a lift which
disgorged us at Basement Level 2.
The cashier greeted us in listless Cantonese and, quickly tiring of
our awkward pantomime, waved us off down the corridor, where a lackey
listened to our embarrassed garbling with similar incomprehension. We
bristled with prurient curiosity as we were led through corridors of
booths, their doors tightly closed against intrusion.
Furtive glances through the small windows in these doors brought
furious glares from the Chinese couples huddled inside, bathed in the
seedy glow of the red light. Our escort failed to conceal a slight
sneer, obviously contemptuous of our naivety. Our embarrassment
increased and we considered bolting for the lift, but he had already
directed us, via curt body language, to our own private booth in the
yellow corridor.
Whipping out a pad, he impatiently awaited our order. Vague
gesticulations towards a beer mat for San Miguel and much waving of two
fingers eventually satisfied him and sent him on his way, whereupon we
took in our surroundings and promptly collapsed in a giggling heap.
The discreetest of inquiries had furnished us with the address of this
establishment. It had taken us a little while to find it as it wasn't
signposted on the street outside, strange in a city where every business
wears its enticements on huge neon signs which punctuate the drab
multi-storey buildings like so many garish exclamation marks. But this
place was cloaked in a privacy which lent it an irresistible air of
mystique. Nothing illegal was taking place but the clients all had a
guarded quality which suggested illicit activity, but then they take
their karaoke pretty seriously in Hong Kong.
I was there for a dare, and Sandra, my companion in crime, had been
dragged along for moral support. ''I'm not singing,'' she had warned me,
''definitely not.'' I wasn't too keen on tickling the tonsils either but
I was committed to the endeavour. A gauntlet had been laid down when my
friend Karin had heard I was passing through Hong Kong on my way to and
from Australia.
''You've got to go to a karaoke bar when you're there,'' she had
insisted firmly.
''Not bloody likely,'' I retorted, the phrase ''ritual humiliation''
ringing in my ears.
''No, just think, it's a perfect opportunity to have a go at it. You
could go to a bar full of strangers. It wouldn't be embarrassing because
no-one would know you.''
I was still dubious until Karin announced that she would try out
karaoke during a business trip to Hong Kong in November. Who was I to
duck such a challenge? I cringed inwardly as I heard myself announce I'd
do it first.
I had put off the awful moment on the way to Sydney and had
prevaricated for a day and a night on the return trip. Finally, there
was only a few hours until checking-in time at the airport, and so a
blood-stirring shopping frenzy was interrupted and we arrived at the
California Red Karaoke Box, open from 12pm to 6am. Its warren of private
booths wasn't exactly what I had expected and I wasn't too sure that it
was all quite Marquis of Queensberry rules with regards to Karin's dare.
After all, not only would no-one I knew hear me, strangers wouldn't
either. In fact no-one would hear me. Except a sympathetic Sandra. Well,
she had been sympathetic: as I eyed the microphone nervously and
whispered ''testing, testing'', she began sniggering helplessly. By the
time I was cautiously crooning along to kd lang's plaintive Constant
Craving, Sandra had slithered off her banquette, tears streaming down
her face. Her gasps of laughter were just a little bit disconcerting. I
was having enough trouble keeping the tune trying to follow the words
lit up on the television monitor.
''That one was a bit slow,'' I muttered by way of excuse for a truly
awful performance, pushing the code for Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weenie Yellow
Polkadot Bikini into the remote control gadget. By the time the chap
showed up with the San Miguels Sandra looked like she was more in need
of a quick gulp of oxygen, so advanced was her hysteria.
Struggling unsuccessfully to keep a straight face, Sandra suggested
Silence is Golden, but I plumped for Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep for the
nostalgic reason that it was the first single I had ever bought. I sang
with increasing gusto. This karaoke business was surprisingly addictive.
Indeed, by the second chorus of Where's Your Mama Gone Sandra had
stopped laughing, was humming along, and was surreptitiously tugging the
second microphone towards her.
We debated the next number, ''Let's live dangerously'', cueing the
Banana Boat Song. As we tried out various styles, from Roy Orbison's
Pretty Woman to Summer Nights -- me singing John Travolta and Sandra as
Olivia Newton John -- I began to feel a little guilty about all the time
I had sat in bars in Glasgow and snickered at those who had strut their
karaoke thang. But only a little.
OUR version of Delilah was quite magnificent, with anquished
intonation and an appropriate melodramatic flourish on ''I Felt the
Knife/ And she laughed no more'' but it truly was the moment I felt I
needed to share with a wider audience. As we got into a muddle over the
fast tempo of Jolene we agreed we had succumbed to temporary insanity.
Suddenly we noticed with alarm the red light on the record button on the
elaborate panel. Attempts to illicit information on this new development
from the non-English speaking staff proved fruitless.
Feeling slightly grubby I paid the cashier at her tinted window glass
and we left feeling uneasy. A burst of laughter behind us increased my
paranoia. The thought that there is a pirate tape of my version of Like
a Virgin, circulating around Hong Kong now haunts my dreams. But I
shouldn't imagine that Madonna is losing any sleep over it.

BOMBAY: Customs officials in India have ordered distributors not to
supply bookshops with SalmanRushdie's latest novel, The Moor's Last
Sigh, while they re-examine the contents. Some politicians say it
parodies right-wing Hindu political leader Bal Thackeray, but even if
most Indians are not able to read the book, Prime Minister P V Narasimha
Rao is receiving an autographed copy.

WASHINGTON: President Clinton yesterday denounced the sabotage of the
Amtrak passenger train derailed in the Arizona desert on Monday as an
act of cowardice, and said he was ''profoundly outraged''.
As investigators swarmed over the wreckage of the crash, in which one
crewman died, the president said: ''I want to make it clear we will do
everything we can to catch whoever is responsible.'' However a computer
search has failed to come up with any group known as ''Sons of the
Gestapo'', who left signed notes near the scene.

Margaret Vaughan examines the dilemma facing civil servants who are
anxious to preserve their political neutrality
IN ANOTHER political life, a callow young minister held a hat-trick of
posts. Sitting MP, Government Minister, and party chairman rolled into
one.
No-one was ever sure when the resources of an impartial Scottish
Office Civil Service were being used on Government business or if they
were being suborned to further party interests. The lines were blurred
and even the minister seemed, sometimes, bewildered. Partisan politics
surfaced in areas where they had no business to be.
The crunch came with an edict that all key St Andrew's House documents
must be passed to Michael Forsyth -- in his earlier incarnation as
Thatcherite brawler-in-chief of the Scottish Conservatives.
Concern centred on a memo written by then Scottish Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind's private secretary to all departments, stating that all
ministerial papers were to be circulated to Forsyth ''in the light of
his appointment as chairman of the Scottish Conservative party''.
It was seen as a major departure from accepted practice, a threat to
the political neutrality of the Civil Service. Angry civil servants
rumbled and grumbled and considered a legal challenge. Then it was
forgotten because Forsyth went away.
That was in May, 1990. Now, as we all know, because we keep being
told, Forsyth is a politician reborn. The old wily Bad Lad of Scottish
mythology has evolved to become the new, open People's Friend: soothing,
listening, emollience personified.
Still, the fact that Forsyth could so easily swop hats and forget
which he was wearing when, in the bad old bogeyman days, may lie behind
the suspicion which attaches to the timing of a new analysis of
expenditure and revenue published by the Scottish Office.
Drawn up by economists and statisticians at the Scottish Office, the
analysis showed that Scotland was far better off within the UK. And,
fortuitously, it was published in Scotland on the opening day of the
Conservative Party Conference.
The Scottish Office rejected SNP claims that civil servants had been
''dragooned'' or ''prostituted themselves'' in the service of Forsyth.
''Ministers were not involved in drawing up the content of the
document,'' a spokesman said. Well no, of course not. Isn't it the
timing of the release that is the crucial factor?
Memories were rekindled too by Forsyth's use of a Scottish Office fax
for what was described as ''party political propaganda'' by Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson. A Scottish Office spokesman
insisted a ''trifling'' sum was involved, adding: ''This is part of
ongoing business of government.'' Really? A letter to Tony Blair during
the Labour Conference about Labour policy? Confusing!
Yesterday it emerged that Michael Heseltine's dual responsibility as
co-ordinator of both Tory Party and Government policy presentations has
led to anxiety among civil servants. They say staff from Tory Party
Central Office have attended meetings with civil servants.
Now Sir Robin Butler, the Cabinet Secretary and head of the Home Civil
Service, is reportedly drawing up new guidelines on the activities of
civil servants. He has asked Whitehall's permanent secretaries to
monitor Ministers' instructions to civil servants to attend, or speak
at, meetings of political pressure groups.
This, it's alleged by fed-up civil servants, follows instructions that
they should address conferences organised by the right-wing Adam Smith
Institute, which promotes privatisation and the free market. Officials
were told to speak at two seminars organised by the group.
The mandarins' union, the First Division Association, believes it is
exactly this sort of thing which is making it hard for those within the
service who believe that it ought to remain politically neutral to
persuade others that this is so.
Scotland's permanent under-secretary, Sir Russell Hillhouse, yesterday
redirected our inquiries about Civil Service neutrality to the Cabinet
Secretary. The Cabinet Secretary's spokeswoman insisted that Sir Robin
was merely issuing guidance to departments which had been in preparation
for some time.
''There's been a growth of various political pressure organisations
and a proliferation of invitations to civil servants. This is the kind
of advice put out from time to time,'' she explained.
But why should it be necessary? A new code of ethics for civil
servants was, after all, unveiled by the Government in January of this
year. Its aim was to head off complaints that during more than 15 years
in office it has politicised the Civil Service and jeopardised its
supposed political neutrality.
The code, issued to each of the country's 500,000 civil servants, said
officials should act with ''integrity, impartiality and honesty'' in
their dealings with Ministers. It binds them not to act in a way that is
''illegal, improper, unethical, or in breach of constitutional
convention''.
Oddly, then, Sir Robin Butler maintained that such a code was
unnecessary because civil servants' responsibilities were already
clearly defined. Something must have made him change his mind.
Most senior civil servants will concede that it is extremely difficult
always to draw the line between explaining policy and advocating the
same. The distinction between what is in the interests of party and
state can become blurred.
John Moffat, who is the Civil and Public Service Association
representative at the Scottish Office says there is real concern about
erosion of neutrality: ''Being able to prove it is slightly difficult.
But manipulating civil servants for a party political end happens. And
there are instances where we have felt it was getting too close to the
knuckle.''

THE Diary has never counted Lord Jenkins of Hillhead as a sex symbol
but we have been proved wrong by a newly-published biography of Lee
Bouvier Radziwill, younger sister of Jaqueline Kennedy-Onassis.
Roy Jenkins, as he then was, occupies two brief but interesting pages
of the book In Her Sister's Shadow. The lady in question was married to
a Polish royal person, Prince Stanislas Radziwill but was having
something of a fling with Roy.
We take up the story on page 207: ''Lee's primary amorous
entertainment those days was the politician Roy Jenkins, who was
Chancellor of the Exchequer in Harold Wilson's Labour government. 'I
wouldn't call it a big affair,' said a mutual friend of theirs. 'There
again, Lee wouldn't have slept with Roy if he hadn't been Chancellor of
the Exchequer. Like lots of people, Roy liked talking to Lee -- he
enjoyed her funny little breathy voice and her very pretty face. But
don't misunderstand, the heart was not engaged. Lee was a starfucker
(author Diana Dubois's unfortunate sweary word, not ours) and Roy was a
considerable star in those days.''
Princess Radziwill was into power and regarded Jenkins as a future
Prime Minister. As Truman Capote was quoted as saying some years later:
''She was involved with some old fellow in England who was going to be
Prime Minister. Jackie kept urging her to marry him. Then when he didn't
get to be Prime Minister, they dropped him.''
We are treated to a pen portrait of the former MP for Glasgow
Hillhead: ''Literate, bookish, a prolific diarist and writer (notably of
political biographies), Roy Jenkins was the darling of the
intellectuals, yet many people remained leery of him, even inside his
own party. They accused him of the vice of aristocracy.''
Lord Jenkins receives a further less then complimentary testimonial in
the book from a London socialite chappie by the name of Taki
Theodoracopulos: ''He came from a working-class background but affected
upper-class mannerisms. He was a climber . . . He's reached the top now,
he's become a lord, but I would have much more respect for him if he
wasn't such a snob. You can't compare Roy Jenkins to a bunch of buffoon
dukes who know nothing except how to fart loudly in public and shoot.
He's a much better person, but in one respect, he's a worse person
because he's such a snob.'' And, it appears, a bit of shagger in his
day.
All Greek
A FORM for parents interested in becoming a member of a school board
has a section aimed at establishing details of ethnic origin. We hear of
one parent who rather missed the point. Beside the request for
information on ''first language'' the proud mother wrote: ''He said
'mammy' when he was six months old.''
Hopeless case
PASTOR Jack Glass has always had a way with words but we think he has
excelled himself with the front-page heading in the current issue of his
propaganda sheet, the Scottish Protestant View. The article, dealing
with the Vatican's plans for unity among the Christian churches, carries
the banner headline: ''Better a popeless hope than a hopeless Pope.''
This is very much in the tradition of the banners which Jack and
followers brandished in St Peter's Square with the words ''No Pope
here''.
Full steam ahead
READERS with long memories may recall our stories about the cappuccino
wars between the Glasgow licensing board and Mark Norris who wanted to
keep his Insomnia cafe in Woodlands Road open 24 hours a day.
No you can't, the board said, because you need a special licence to
sell coffee after 11pm at night. OK then, said Mr Norris, I'll put in
coffee vending machines for which you do not need a licence.
The good news is that common sense has prevailed and Insomnia has been
given permission by the city fathers to go wild and, what the heck, sell
coffee and snacks round the clock.
The board was won over by letters from far and wide -- from visiting
New Yorkers who were relieved to find a place to go in Glasgow in the
wee small hours and even from Insomnia's upstair neighbours.
When Insomnia opens its doors as usual at 8.30am next Wednesday, they
hope henceforth to have the proud boast: ''We never closed.''
Amazing Graces
''LOOKING for that elusive Christmas present?'' asks the National
Galleries of Scotland brochure, perhaps a little prematurely. Well, help
is at hand, for at each National Gallery shop you will find a new range
of ''beautiful, unusual, and amusing gifts'' for the more erudite
shopper.
As might be expected from such institutes of culture, the collection
is suitably refined, including the tasteful bahookies of the Three
Graces T-shirt. And a range of recycled belts, badges, and Filofaxes
made from old USA car number plates. As the brochure says, ''What more
could a Christmas shopper ask for?'' Indeed.
* FOR the man who has everything except a brain, may we recommend the
Top Gear Full Metal Racket 2 tape. The cassette, produced by the BBC Top
Gear motoring team features ''88 of the world's greatest racing cars
recorded in razor-sharp digital stereo''. The racing cars were recorded
at the Goodwood Festival of Speed and include the deafening racket of
the Maserati, Bentley, Ferrari, and a Spitfire.
All yours for #4.99. Aspirin for the sore heid is extra.
Bargain break
ONE of the saddest aspects of the new Tory Britain is that health care
has become a commodity. Thus we find a leaflet for the Park Nursing Home
in Glasgow trumpeting: ''We have extended our three weeks' respite care
for the price of two due to popular demand. Nursing care at a price
everyone can afford.''
Good news, Granny, you can live for an extra week.

Stuart Trotter writes: Labour's ''right to roam'' policy came under
fire from Environment Secretary John Gummer.
He told the conference: ''Any party which can make the main plank in
its rural policy the right to roam regardless of what local people want
is a 'We know best' party.''
It was a small policy but it was typical of Labour's desire to impose
one rule on everyone.
Mr Gummer, who is to present a rural White Paper to Parliament next
week indicated that it would contain proposals to help walkers.
Although the Minister said he agreed with those who did not want new
supermarkets built at the expense of the centre of towns where they
opened, he omitted a sentence in his text promising that supermarkets
would be built in town centres in future rather than on greenfield sites
on the outskirts.

Party urged to unite for victory.
TORY chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney yesterday gave a broad hint that
taxes will be cut in next month's Budget, despite the reservations which
have been voiced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke.
He told the conference it had been right, if politically painful, for
the Government, to raise taxes to help the country out of recession.
Dr Mawhinney was careful to talk about tax policy ''over the next few
years'' and insisted that the Government always would be prudent.
However, he added: ''This party chairman confirms again that our
instinct, our goal, is to reduce tax. It always has been and will be --
so watch this space.''
He launched an attack on the BBC's Today programme which, he said,
though not officially an Opposition party, had a political philosophy.
''It believes strongly that there is no problem which cannot be solved
by more public spending.''
In one week, when he heard the programme monitored, he said, it gave
air time to people calling on the Government to increase spending by
almsot #8 bn. Over 52 weeks, that amounted to #412 bn or #62 per working
person per day.
Dr Mawhinney added: ''Let me remind the BBC that this Government does
not govern because it has won some broadcasting award. It has a mandate.
The Today programme only has a licence.'' He said he would continue
monitoring Today.
He received a standing ovation for a fighting speech designed to
hearten the party faithful who, he acknowledged, had experienced
difficult times in the last three years.
In a reference to the fierce internal rows over Europe, he said:
''There is no shame in honest dispute. But I don't like friendly fire.''
He set out the formula with which the Tories are likely to fight the
next election. For a federal Europe, vote Liberal Democrat; for a
centralised Europe run from Brussels, vote Labour; for a Europe of
nation states with the major decisions affecting Britain taken in
Britain, vote Conservative.
He said that by re-electing John Major as leader earlier this year,
the Tories had chosen to ''unite, look to the future and to fight to
win'' instead of heading for Opposition.
Dr Mawhinney said: ''Conference, our winning formula is nearly
complete.
''Remind the people of what we have achieved. Tell them how we will
build on that achievement through into the next century. And help them
to understand the alternatives.''
Dr Mawhinney gave strong support to the tough line on crime taken by
Home Secretary Michael Howard. He said: ''People know that low incomes,
unemployment and broken homes are serious issues which need to be
addressed seriously; but they don't cause crime.
''Criminals cause crime. To argue otherwise is to undermine and
slander many good, law-abiding people. Our sympathies lie with the
victims of crime, not the perpetrators.''
He was loudly applauded when he added: ''People are outraged -- and so
am I --when someone who is only trying to defend himself or his property
winds up being prosecuted while the attacker gets off with slapped
wrist.''
He made no mention of defecting MP Alan Howarth, but he admitted:
''Until July, we spent too long highlighting differences within our own
ranks.
''Now we will show the world that that is in the past and that the
real division lies between us and the other parties.''
He warned that a Labour Government would ''bankrupt Britain'' and only
Tory policies would deliver long-term economic growth, jobs and
prosperity.
''The message to our opponents is uncompromising. For the sake of our
country, get out of our way -- we're on our way to victory,'' he said.
Seizing on recent reports of a leaked memo by one of Mr Blair's
advisers, he said it showed that Labour's self-assessment was that they
were not fit to govern and led the conference in a chorus of ''Not fit
to govern.''

SUPPORT for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and measures to
free farmers from the burdens of red tape will be at the centre of the
Government's White Paper on agriculture to be published when Parliament
returns next week.
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg told the conference that he would
fight for British interests in Europe, but warned against knee-jerk
unilateral action to defend UK farming and fishing.
''The countryside is a national asset. We have a duty to maintain a
green and pleasant land. But the countryside is not a museum; it is and
always will be a place where millions live and work. Reconciling these
two objectives lies at the heart of this Government's rural policy,'' he
said.
The White Paper would enshrine two Government objectives; greater
liberalisation of markets, and increased transparency of European
subsidy payments.
''Within a reformed agricultural policy there will be support for
farmers, but the objectives of that support will be more clearly stated,
not primarily linked to production, and funded by the taxpayer and not
by the consumer,'' he said.
On the fishing industry, he said international agreement was the best
way of protecting stocks. Britain would work to enforce the Common
Fisheries Policy.
His speech, which did not earn a standing ovation, included an attack
on his Labour counterpart, Edinburgh East MP Gavin Strang.
''I find it strange that a party which is bent on devolution should
suppose it proper that policies of such vital importance to the English
countryside should be determined by one who represents the built-up
areas of a Scottish city,'' he said.
''No wonder Gavin Strang's only policy for the countryside is a right
to trespass. He seems to think that marching across private farmland is
the same as roaming down Edinburgh's Princes Street.''
Mr Hogg also attacked animal rights activists, accusing them of
intolerance and muddled thinking.

MR John Redwood brought his right-wing and firmly Unionist message to
the Tory conference in Blackpool yesterday, with a vigorous attack on
Labour's plans for Scottish devolution.
Mr Redwood, who has established himself as the standard-bearer of the
Euro-sceptic Tory right since his unsuccessful attempt to unseat Mr
Major earlier this year, made two appearances on the conference fringe
that attracted capacity crowds to hear his alternative to Government
policy.
Labour, he said, was prepared to throw away the country in a fit of
absent mindedness, while the Tories were the party of the Union: ''The
next election is not just a battle over who rules Britain. It will be a
battle over whether there is a Britain left to rule.''
Applying his faith in low taxation to Scotland's future, Mr Redwood
took up Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's attack on Labour's plans
for a tax-raising Scottish parliament.
''I never did understand the attraction to anyone, let alone a Scot,
of the idea that anywhere getting devolution would have the privilege of
paying more tax. A tartan tax for the privilege of being Scottish?
Taking all the whisky out of the bars of Glasgow would prove more
popular,'' he said.
He also offered a corollary to the West Lothian question, by
complaining that Scottish MPs at Westminster, rather than voting on
purely English matters, would be powerless to do anything for their
constituents on housing, education, law and order, or economic
development.
''What would be the point of being an MP in such circumstances? Why
would we want to pay for them? And why should they help decide all those
things for England when they don't decide them for Scotland?'' he asked.
He said: ''A Scottish parliament is a step on the road to breaking the
kingdom. It undemines the truly British institutions. the United Kingdom
of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland is one country united
with a single Parliament, a single currency, a single language, and one
monarch. Never let them be shattered by needless constitutional
experiment.''
Meanwhile, also on the fringe trail last night, Home Secretary Michael
Howard was warning against a breach of the Union, when he claimed that
British nationhood faced a threat from devolution.
He said that a Scottish parliament would lead to the break-up of
Britain, explaining: ''It would be used as a springboard for
independence by the SNP. It has made that perfectly clear.
''As people in Scotland began to realise they were paying higher
income tax than the English, simply for the privilege of paying yet more
politicians, they would be very angry. The SNP would seek to cash in on
this by urging them to go the whole hog.''
He added: ''A Scottish parliament would be a disaster. It would cause
bitter discontent on both sides of the Border. It would cause grave
damage to the Scottish economy as higher taxes undermined its
competitiveness. It would indeed lead to the break-up of Britain.''

ALMOST 70% of Scottish voters would prefer extra Government money to
be spent on education services rather than on providing tax cuts,
according to a poll commissioned by the public services union Unison.
The survey carried out by System Three found remarkably similar views
on this issue among supporters of all political parties. Sixty-five
percent of Tory and SNP voters preferred more spending on education
while 73% of Labour voters and 70% of Liberal Democrats felt the same
way.
Shadow Scottish Education Minister Maria Fyffe said money spent on
education benefited the individual and society.
Mr Matt Smith, Scottish Secretary of Unison, who announced the poll
findings at a press conference in Stirling, said they went straight to
the heart of the union's ''Public Service not Private Sleaze'' campaign.
''We are saying that the Government should increase spending on
services like education and ignore the Hard Right calls for more tax
cuts,'' Mr Smith said.
''It seems that is what the Scottish people and even Scottish Tory
supporters are also saying.''
System Three interviewed 1045 Scots between August 24 and 29.
Unison's campaign, which aims to defend and promote publicly
controlled services, continues with a demonstration in London on October
21.

THE blanket ban on homosexuals and lesbians serving in the armed
forces is justified because of the risk they pose to the morale and
effectiveness of the services, the Court of Appeal was told yesterday.
It was a rational judgment ''born of experience'' which was not open
to legal challenge, said Mr Stephen Richards, appearing for Defence
Secretary Michael Portillo.
Four dismissed service personnel, three men and a woman -- former RAF
nurse Jeanette Smith, 28, from Edinburgh -- are fighting a test case to
overturn the policy on the grounds that it breaches the European
Convention on Human Rights and European Union equal treatment
directives.
In June, two High Court judges ruled that the ban was lawful, although
one thought the policy was wrong and doomed as ''the tide of history''
was against the MoD.
The four are asking appeal judges to rule that the High Court was
wrong in law and to order it to be scrapped.
On the second day of the hearing, Mr Richards said the problem of
homosexuals in the services had been vigorously debated ''across the
world''.
He said that details of the policy had received careful and repeated
examination by successive Ministers and Parliamentary select committees
over a number of years.
Mr Richards told the court that if there was evidence that problems
could arrive which could put military effectiveness at risk ''then that
is a sufficient foundation for the policy''.
The hearing continues.

ROCK singer Sting happily agreed to sign what amounted to a blank
cheque to save his accountant from bankruptcy, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Keith Moore, 51, who is accused of stealing #6m from the singer and
actor, said the performer never asked him how much was needed or whether
his now-defunct company was solvent.
As far as he was concerned, Sting was simply ''glad'' to help him.
The financial adviser, who was spending a second day in the witness
box, also told Southwark Crown Court in London that the former Police
lead singer still owed him #1m in ''undercharged'' fees. Office
''inefficiency'' was the only reason he had never been billed.
Mr Moore, of Fulham, denies 15 sample charges of theft between August
1988 and July 1992. The Crown claims the accountant syphoned off
millions from Sting's accounts at Coutts &amp; Co and ''shunted'' the money
into a Bank of Scotland account before transferring it to an investment
company.
The money was then ploughed into a series of largely unsuccessful
ventures, including the conversion of Russian military aircraft into
''super jumbos'' and an international chain of Indian restaurants.
Around #1.3m was also used to stave off bankruptcy twice.
Mr Moore, who told the jury Sting and he ''trusted'' each other, has
insisted the chart-topping performer knew about the general principles
of the investment strategy but had not been told of the details.
He said the first time he used the star's cash to save himself from
bankruptcy involved a #691,000 unpaid tax bill.
The financial adviser said the money would be effectively repaid out
of a 5% fee on a $24m saving he had secured for Sting following royalty
negotiations.
However, Sting told the jury last week his accountant was never paid
on a percentage basis and had never taken part in the royalty
negotiations with his record company. The trial continues.

The movers and shakers of the fashion world are in Milan to see what's
in store for the spring -- and, John Davidson is sorry to report, we're
all due a short shift in the 60s and 70s time warp.
THERE is not a room to be had in any hotel. You can't get a table at
Le Lange, Bice or La Briciola -- no, not even if you pledge to bring
along your own chairs and eat quickly. And it really must be easier to
pass through the eye of a needle than to enter the ultra-chic Prada
store on St Andrea -- constantly besieged by anxious young things
clamouring for some multi-million-lira mythical must-have bag, belts or
shoes.
Milan is under occupation this week by a vast army of fashion pros.
These people are the arbiters of style responsible for what appears in
fashion-store windows or finds its way on to a glossy magazine cover:
buyers, stylists, photographers -- the movers, shakers, liggers and
copyists of the multi-billion-dollar business which is fashion. And me.
This is the first of four weeks of fashion frenzy, in which the ragbag
band of pros will travel the Western world viewing designer collections
for next spring. It's a moveable feast at which the meaty main course
will be served up next week in Paris. Then sorbet? London promises to
cleanse jaded fashion palates with a string of funky shows from fresh
young design talent. Finally we should be saving room for a slice of Big
Apple pie, courtesy of New York's fashion elite -- Calvin, Donna and
Ralph. Milan, meanwhile, provides an appetiser -- the first glimpse of
how designers see fashion shaping up for next spring.
So far the season looks like following a mish-mash of 60s and 70s
ideas. Short shift dresses, oh so Jackie O, appear in every collection.
Hipsters and low-rise skirtsare universal. Frightened? There is much
worse to come. Kaftans short as a shirt, with a drawstring right under
the bust; in pinstripe or show-your-knickers lace, these were a major
statement at Gucci. This show was well received, although the clothes
were only a background for the wonderful accessories such as low-slung
squelchy bags in dyed monkey fur or snakeskin and the signature
bamboo-handled handbag, now available in peacock plumes.
Sleeveless tunics worn with trousers have emerged as an important
idea. Executed straightforwardly at MaxMara in white double-knit jersey,
they were the stars of a collection which successfully fused perfectly
commercial fashion with a frisson of fashion fizz. At Callaghan, British
designer Scott Crolla gave his version of the tunic -- a zipper
fastening and a low-slung self belt. This was a collection where the
strength of ideas and ingenuity outshone the finesse of their execution.
To pure, brilliant white (certainly a must for next summer) Lawrence
Steele added sunshine yellow for cute daisy-spattered shift dresses. His
style references (tie belts and pocket flaps for a hint of safari --
even that daisy motif) and choice of fabrics (slub silk and oiled satin)
were what has been seen everywhere else this week. Yet Steele handled
them with exceptional charm and a skill which belied his relative youth.
But fashion pros know that the Milan shows have much more to do with
commercial muscle than true creativity. And true to form, there have
been more new hairstyles than fresh ideas on the runways here. Some
hairdressers should urgently seek artistic asylum in some far-off corner
of the world. Linda Evangelista opened the Dolce &amp; Gabbana show with her
particularly horrible new hairdo safely tucked inside the hood section
of an ankle-length sleeveless black dress. Renowned for dramatic changes
in coiffeur, the big E's latest experiment displays unprecedented
indecision. The front is blonde; the back, brunette. Perhaps it's
intended as a swatch for the range of hair colour products she now
endorses.
The show itself covered territory familiar to devotees: Sicily -- the
designers' reminiscences of the island in times past offered up with wit
and aplomb for women of today. This translated into shapely suits and
tie-belted coats in slub silk, sleeveless crepe tunics -- slashed to the
waist for a glimpse of matching bikini bottoms -- and pearly white
cocktail dresses delicately beaded with traceries of pastel flowers, all
wrapped up in squirrel stoles.
But although this season's plethora of animal print really should have
rendered it extinct, big cat spots and stripes survive at Dolce &amp;
Gabbana. Tigers stalked the runway as a trilby hat for Linda, leopards
were tamed into a flowing djellaba for Nadja and an A-line tunic for
little Kate Moss. A skin-tight sheer leopard shirt over matching bikini
must be the perfect outfit for popping down to the shops on a summer's
day. Just add a roomy basket, Naomi Campbell's pneumatic black body, and
shake very gently.

Ruth Wishart hits back at the notion that lack of ambition rather than
prejudice is what prevents women from becoming MPs
IN THE normal course of events I view the practice of one columnist
commenting on another's work as a particularly self-indulgent form of
incest. For John MacLeod it is finally necessary to make an exception.
Misogyny has long been one of his specialist subjects, but yesterday's
offering berating the move towards gender parity in a Scottish
parliament qualified more as rant than rational argument.
It may be that when you are an adherent of a church whose joie de
vivre is less than legendary and choose to spend much of your life
living in semi-solitary confinement on the islands, then a rant is the
nearest thing to fun available.
But so much of the text was unadjacent to the truth that it demands a
response.
The fact that women are desperately under-represented in the
Westminster parliament, he would have you believe, is mere happenstance.
There has been no conspiracy, no enshrined prejudice; it's just that
women don't much go in for that sort of thing, and when they do, lack
ambition.
Now, he says, they are looking for a free leg-up, proof positive of
their weakness and their inability to win in free and fair competition.
When Mr MacLeod next descends from the planet Zog he might like to
consider some of the following. Far from there being no prejudice it has
been endemic. Across the party lines many women have found it impossible
even to make short-lists let alone be selected on winnable territory.
But for the laws of libel, I could cite two dozen examples where Ms
Bright Hope has been eclipsed by Councillor Buggins or Mr Deadbeat
because the selection, not to put too fine a point on it, has been
stitched up by the boys.
As for women being less active, let's look at that again in terms of
logistics. Women, literally, left holding the baby are less likely to
make meetings carefully scheduled for the wean's bedtime or the family
tea, that is true. They are less likely to be able to consider a
Westminster career when that effectively takes them out of the domestic
equation for half the week. More might come forward, of course, if more
male legislators looked on child care as a priority, and more husbands
and columnists did not persist in supposing children to be the product
of virgin births.
One of the other important aspects of getting the first Scottish
parliament right is that it is envisaged there will be civilised hours,
peripatetic committees, and proper account taken of school holidays. All
ways of making it more accessible, more all embracing, and less like a
drinking den with a vote or two thrown in.
MacLeod as much as acknowledges these difficulties with the current
parliamentary set up by supposing that few of these women will be
mothers, fewer than average will be married, and a disproportionate
number will be aggressive feminists. The proposed restructuring is
specifically geared to the opposite -- to more mothers and married
women. As for the feminists, they will come with an aggressive feminist
agenda pursuing policies on abortion, censorship, child care and
education, criminology and so on.
Dead right, John! Just as soon as I get the dungarees back from the
cleaners I'll be cheering on any candidate of any persuasion who
champions equality of opportunity, better nursery provision, freedom to
plan families, and the eschewing of racist, sexist, homophobic
fundamentalism.
Most breathtaking of all, your man then alleges that to tinker with
the institutions of democracy to achieve such a social or cultural aim
is to attack democracy itself. Words fail me. Almost! Without tinkering,
people who didn't own houses wouldn't have had the vote. Neither would
people under 30. Or women. Universal franchise is the product of the
most gloriously essential tinkering.
Of course, it would be better if we could achieve fairness by natural
means.
Life hasn't been like that. The 1945 election produced 24 women MPs.
By 1970 this had shot up to 26. It actually fell back to 19 in 1979, and
now we have a record number. A whole 60 -- or less than 10%.
It's not hard to find a chauvinist, bigoted logic behind the drive for
parity, he concludes. Right again, sunbeam!
What do we want -- an even playing field.
When do we want it -- NOW!

STUC general secretary Campbell Christie last night won support from
probably where he least wanted it -- with Secretary of State Michael
Forsyth leaping to his defence, writes Robbie Dinwoodie.
As revealed in The Herald yesterday, the STUC general council voted to
reject a place on the board of Highlands and Islands Enterprise because
the Scottish Office was insisting that it was only on offer to Mr
Christie, and not to any other nominee.
The move was made for practical reasons, in that Mr Campbell would
have difficulty devoting time to the post, and on principle because the
STUC's suggested nominees had been rejected.
There was a perception by some in the STUC that the Secretary of State
was trying to use Mr Christie as a way of splitting the Labour movement.
Mr Forsyth took the opportunity last night to drive the wedge in
further. ''I am sorry Campbell Christie is being lambasted by the hard
left,'' he said.
He added that Mr Christie's sin seemed to be that he was a friend of
the Secretary of State, whereas in fact he was ''a friend of Scotland,
someone interested in what is good for his country''.
He said of the criticisms: ''I regret that -- it is pretty
disgraceful, some of the comments of people attacking him for trying to
do his best for Scotland.''
Before leaving for a visit to Europe yesterday, Mr Christie made clear
that he had at no point agreed with the Scottish Office to accept the
HIE post and it was therefore wrong to suggest that an appointment had
been blocked.
He also pointed out that he personally had not raised the issue at the
general council meeting and he agreed with the decision that the STUC
should not accept the nomination in the circumstances.
Meanwhile, Mr Forsyth issued a challenge to Labour authorities and to
organisations such as the STUC to put more people forward for public
appointments and insisted that if the right calibre of candidates came
forward he would be happy to appoint them.

THE brothers of a murdered Leith prostitute, who yesterday made an
emotional plea for help in tracking her killer, also criticised the lack
of ''safe houses'' for women working the streets.
Andrew and Gordon Donald said they and their family did not know their
40-year-old sister, battered to death at the weekend, was a prostitute,
and urged the public not to make judgments about her lifestyle.
Mr Andrew Donald, 32, who broke down during the press conference at
Leith police station, said they were ''totally devastated'', adding: ''I
feel like a part of my soul has been ripped away.
''The Government talks about the year 2000 and its forward thinking,
yet we are one of the only countries in Europe that does not have safe
houses for these girls.
''If they must work like that let it be safe, in brothels. They should
not be out on the streets.''
His brother Gordon, 30, seated beside Detective Chief Inspector Ian
Jackson, who is heading the hunt for the killer of Mrs Christine Dinnie,
a mother of four, said much had been said about his sister's lifestyle.
''Irrespective of what Christine did, she was my sister. She was also
a very good mother to her four children, and a very loving grandmother.
She was also a human being.''
Mrs Dinnie, from Edinburgh's Craigmillar area, was found dead with
severe head injuries on Saturday morning, on a footway in West Bowling
Street.
Mr Gordon Donald, who said the family did not want anyone else to
suffer as they had, added: ''Whoever this person is cannot be acting
normally and I'm sure someone will know more about this.''
He said the last time he had seen her she had looked ''brilliant'' and
he was proud of her. ''She was always laughing and smiling. She had a
big heart.''
Mr Jackson said the police were following a number of lines of
inquiry, including the possibility the killer was among her clientele,
and were working closely with prostitutes' welfare groups.
He said Mrs Dinnie had frequented the Leith area on and off since
1985, and had friends there. He said a number of clients had come
forward but not in the numbers the police would like.
Police are advising prostitutes to work at least in pairs and to take
car registration numbers.

The world of unidentified flying objects draws its share of cranks and
charlatans, but John Linklater discovers many anxious people simply need
explanations
THE conspiracy theory on Government witholding UFO documentation has
been launched with a vengeance. Operation Right to Know demonstrated
outside the Commons yesterday, demanding the release of X-files. And on
Monday night, 700 people attended a meeting in Falkirk Town Hall to hear
American ufologist Phyllis Schelemmer deliver a message direct from the
Council of Nine, alleged guardians of the cosmos: ''You are not alone
and there is no death.'' What is going on?
Ever since Orson Welles produced mass hysteria throughout the United
States on Halloween, 1938, with his radio dramatisation of The War of
The Worlds, which featured a documentary-style presentation and up-date
bulletins to alert the nation to an onslaught by aliens, there has been
a collective paranoia on both sides of the Atlantic over imagined
suppression of UFO data to avoid public alarm.
The theory has an obvious practical appeal, since it puts the onus of
proof on the very official agencies who deny the existence of
extraterrestrial phenomena. It gains ground, particularly in America,
because the Freedom of Information Act has released thousands of pages
of material which demonstrate that whatever else they might say,
Government agencies have investigated claims of sightings and
abductions.
The National Security Agency's 21-page affidavit, arguing why further
material should continue to be witheld, was itself classified as
''beyond top secret''. This does little to help.
It is no coincidence that Operation Right to Know is an organisation
which originated in America, where 57% of the population accept that
there are UFOs and aliens.
But the clamour for answers is disconcerting when it comes from closer
to home. There may be some who enjoy Bonnybridge's lately established
status as the UFO capital of Great Britain, but there has been a
persistent failure to account satisfactorily for some 250 sightings
which cannot be dismissed as weather conditions, ball lightning, lack of
oxygen to the brain or rampant schizophrenia.
Monday night's meeting did little to satisfy its audience. Half had
travelled from beyond the immediate Falkirk catchment, and half claimed
to have sighted UFOs. Among the anoraks, the trainspotters, the
phenomenology tourists, alien freakshow punters (hoping to witness the
falsely heralded appearance of the alien Zal-us) and earnest seekers
after new truths, there was a core of Bonnybridge folk who simply wanted
answers and support.
Their exasperation with messages from Mrs Schelemmer's Council of Nine
and other exotic mysticism from the panel threatened to have the meeting
break up in chaos, in a chorus of angry barracking from the gallery and
impassioned pleas for sensible contributions from the floor.
The much-ridiculed Councillor Billy Buchanan managed to restore order,
and the meeting closed hastily. But not before Mrs Schelemmer, an
American who claimed her introduction to the Council of Nine had come
through the late Dr Andrija Puharich, who discovered Uri Geller and
acted as a psychic for the Reagans when they were in the White House,
attempted to offer solidarity with her claims to have ''experienced''
UFOs regularly since her first sighting of a 25-foot alien craft from
the balcony of her high-rise home in New Jersey in the early morning of
December 31, 1952.
Whatever comfort this might have lent her audience was undermined by
her unfortunate reference to the people of ''Bonnybrook, Falkirk''. Her
geographical precision was not as impressive as the UFOs' which are
claimed to have made the Stirlingshire village a magnet for operations
over the past two years.
Councillor Buchanan's campaign for a full-scale military and
scientific investigation into the ''Bonnybridge phenomonen'', supported
by Falkirk West MP Dennis Canavan, is not as risible as it might appear,
given the genuine disquiet among the constituents they represent.
If there are rational explanations, let them be given the benefit of
them. Otherwise, what is the justification for the Air Staff 2a Office,
with its own secretariat at the Ministry of Defence, in common parlance,
its UFO Desk? It is hardly satisfatory for the MoD to affect disinterest
because ''there are no national security implications'', as the
Bonnybridge campaign has been told and Operation Right to Know is sick
of hearing. What is this, anyway? An admission that extraterrestrial
beings exist, but there's no alarm because they come with benign intent?
UFOs are apparently one MoD embarrassment that will not go away,
sighted or unsighted. At least one former air minister of the 1950s,
George Ward, is believed to have been privately convinced of the
existence of UFOs but resolutely declined to go public, and a former
chief of the defence staff, Lord Hill-Norton, writes forewords for new
books on the subject.
Operation Right to Know would like to make public the data that
evidently convinced those two gentlemen. If they're all barking mad in
there, perhaps we should be allowed to judge for ourselves.

ENVIRONMENTAL health inspectors discovered strains of the E-coli
bacteria in an Indian take-away restaurant in one of the most serious
cases they had dealt with.
Yesterday, Mr Mohammed Iqbal, 35, the owner of the Ashoka Tandoori
Restaurant, Livingston, West Lothian, admitted 17 offences under the
Food Health Regulations and the Food Safety Act.
He said he had hired Rentokill to clean the restaurant after the raid
in September of last year.
An environmental health spokesman said: ''This was one of the most
serious cases we have ever been involved in.''
Procurator-fiscal Linda Ruxton told Linlithgow Sheriff Court ofmouldy
yoghurt, filthy wash-hand basins, aprons which were contaminated with
old food and grease, and microwave ovens, fridges, and freezers which
were rusty or encrusted with old food.
She said: ''Flies were landing on exposed food and there were no
methods of reducing the presence of insects.
''High-risk food, pakora, poppadoms, sauces, salad, cooked slices of
lamb, rice, and chicken, were being stored at the wrong temperature.''
She described how a frozen chicken was being defrosted in warm water
in a sink used for washing dirty dishes.
Samples taken from rice and cooked vegetables revealed the presence of
E-Coli bacteria.
Defence solicitor Stuart Peebles told how Iqbal had re-opened the
restaurant in November last year.
It had been inspected three times since then by environmental health
officials who had no further complaints.
He added: ''At the time of these offences, my client had been running
back and forward between Livingston and Glasgow because both his parents
were ill.''
The sheriff deferred sentence until November 7.

FOR a moment it seemed revolt might be in the air. At the end of the
first conference debate, two representatives defiantly held up their
orange cards against the motion.
As this urged the Government to continue its policies on agriculture,
fisheries and food, it was difficult to know what their stand was, but
the great sea of unanimity on which the conference platform likes to
sail had been at once turned from calm to a slight swell. Was worse to
come?
Well, no -- in terms of votes at least. This debate and the next on
rural affairs gave the conference the chance to express its view on
right-to-ramblers. Farmers who set the dogs on the more assertive ones
would not be without champions.
However, Europe was the touchstone and here the conference showed
restraint. Just as far more of the Labour conference believe in far more
socialism than Mr Blair, so far more of the Tory one favour far more
scepticism than does Mr Major whose lingering desire to be at the heart
of Europe indicates an existing state of schizophrenia between his head
and heart.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind produced a new vision -- an Atlantic community
uniting North America and Europe and perhaps diluting Europe, though he
did not say that. On Europe itself he walked as delicately as Agag. He
produced a passage which looked like a rejection of a single European
nation state although, put under the microscope by Mr Bill Cash, it
might be thought to flatter to deceive.
The Foreign Secretary is a splendid extemporary speaker but is less
happy with a text on which he feels obliged to play variations as he
goes along, usually ending up with a worse speech than he started out
with.
A rather intricate section boiled down -- and the Euro-sceptics are
devoted boilers-down -- to the proposition that if further integration
was not to Britain's advantage the Government would say no; if it was,
they would say yes.
The sceptics can think of no ways in which further integration could
be to our benefit so Mr Rifkind's ''cool assessment'' was coolly
received.
A planned motion was passed without protest and he received a
reluctant standing ovation apparently on the basis that for the
conference not to give a Foreign Secretary one might damage our standing
in the world.
Real enthusiasm only appeared at the end of the speech in which Mr
Michael Portillo showed that, had he chosen instead to tread the boards,
we would have had the best Henry V since Olivier.
No, we wouldn't join a single European army; no, the European Court of
Justice, which would stop encouraging terrorists, were not going to stop
us fighting if we wanted to fight.
He even managed to make defence procurement exciting. The Tomahawk
missile could be fired down a single chimney from a submarine a thousand
miles away. Central Office apparently has thoughts of testing one on a
certain Stratford-on-Avon farm chimney.
Blair and Co. had no right to change their minds and decide they
wanted to defend Britain after all, he roared in a not totally logical
but impressive bit of aggression.
After a side swipe at ''the wishy-washy sociological flim-flam that
passes for history in many of our schools today'' he swept on to invoke
Nelson, Wellington, Churchill, though not, as this is a unity
conference, Thatcher. ''Pride, honour, valour, glory,'' he declaimed.
How could he top that? ''This day is called the feast of Crispian''? No.
He made do with the SAS motto instead.
Unlike Mr Rifkind he looked as if he thoroughly enjoyed making his
speech and the bit, he must have liked most of all was that Mr Major had
to stand applauding him for about five minutes.

A MOTHER whose teenage son died after injecting heroin made a
passionate plea for tougher sentences for drug dealers yesterday.
Keen boxer and keep-fit fanatic Mark McLeod, 18, died from morphine
poisoning.
His mother Margaret yesterday told her story to an anti-drugs
conference, Our Children -- Their Future, organised by Tayside Police in
Dundee.
A 25% rise in recorded drugs offences in the region in the first six
months of this year, compared to the same period in 1994, prompted the
Tayside force to organise the conference.
Since her only son's death, Mrs McLeod, 58, of Springburn, Glasgow,
has formed a support group for parents of drugs victims and abusers.
''My son was murdered and the dealers got away with it,'' she told the
conference yesterday.
''The courts need to do more against them, they are just making a
living on somebody else's misery.''
Mrs McLeod, a retired auxiliary nurse with four daughters, explained
how she had coped in the 11 years since her son died.
''When Mark first died, I felt it was only my pain,'' she said. ''I
was devastated but I'm a strong woman or I wouldn't have got this far.
''I had to tell Mark's story to show how easily this can happen. He
was a great boy but he just started taking cannabis with his friends.''
The day-long conference was also addressed by Special Agent George
Murphy of the US Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

The Hague
Serb brutality gave harrowing accounts of routine beatings, torture,
and deaths at a prison camp in Bosnia, at UN criminal tribunal hearings
for the former Yugoslavia today.
A factory worker told how he saw two fellow Muslims die after being
tortured by a Bosnian Serb prison camp commander who described himself
as God to terrified inmates.
Ibro Osmanovic, 30, described hearing the screams of the men who were
taken out of the detention room at the Susica camp and beaten senseless
at the orders of camp commander Dragan Nikolic.
He said Asim Zildzic was unable to walk or speak when he was brought
back in. ''He could not speak, he just kept sobbing. He died after about
15 or 20 minutes.''
The next morning Nikolic approached Durmo Handzic, who had been unable
to sleep after his beatings, to question him.
''Durmo responded: 'Let me see the sun once more' . . . Durmo started
walking towards the door . . . and after several metres he fell down and
died,'' Osmanovic said.
''Durmo could not sleep. He was such a broken man,'' Redjo Cakisic,
38, a former forestry worker, told the tribunal.
Cakisic, also a prisoner at Susica, said Nikolic ignored Handzic's
pleas to be put out of his misery, taunting: ''A bullet costs a German
mark. You're not worth a cigarette butt.''
Osmanovic, Cakisic and Amir Berbic, a third Muslim held at Susica,
near Vlasenica in north-east Bosnia, were giving evidence on the second
day of public hearings in the Nikolic case.
Nikolic has been at large in Serb-held territory in Bosnia since being
charged in November 1994 with killing and torturing prisoners at the
camp, which was established shortly after rebel Serbs seized Vlasenica
on April 21, 1992.
Prosecutors allege that in the summer of 1992 Nikolic was in charge at
Susica where up to 8000 Muslims may have been held.
Osmanovic said he was taken to the camp on June 18, 1992, and held
with more than 500 other Muslims in cold, cramped conditions and fed a
child's rations once a day.
He told the three judges that Nikolic, always heavily armed, shot over
prisoners' heads to intimidate them and proclaimed: ''Here I am God, the
stick and the law''.
On one occasion Nikolic forced a bayonet into the mouth of a Muslim
prisoner, who spat blood when it was removed. At other times he would
point a pistol at people, cock it and pull the trigger, although there
were no bullets in it.
Osmanovic also said that Nikolic forced him to sit in water for 40
hours and described how the prisoners dreaded night time.
''During the nights everyone waited for the day to come,'' Osmanovic
said. ''The night was the time of horror. Everyone who was taken out and
never returned was taken at night.''
Cakisic, who told the tribunal he had been at school with Nikolic,
said the camp commander had once taken him out of the detention room and
handed him over to two soldiers, saying: ''Here young men, here's your
supper tonight''.
''I was kicked and beaten with rifle butts. When I fell down, they
started walking on me. It took me seven days to get well.''
He said he and other inmates were ordered to pick up the
bullet-riddled bodies of three Muslims from a rain-filled ditch at the
camp and bury them.
The tribunal has so far charged 43 suspected war criminals, including
Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, but has
taken custody of just one, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic whose trial is
expected to start next month.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
A NURSING sister begged doctors not to let her die after she was
stabbed 41 times in her own ward, the High Court in Glasgow heard
yesterday.
However, despite desperate efforts to save her, Ms Irene Duffy, 32,
later died in Glasgow's Stobhill Hospital.
Former boyfriend, Mr Steven McGowan, 30, denies stabbing and murdering
Ms Duffy, of Glenacre Raod, Cumbernauld, on June 18, and of threatening
her previously.
The court was told that Mr McGowan told police: ''She wouldn't let me
see our wee boy and it's Father's Day. I stabbed her.''
Police also claimed Mr McGowan, the hospital electrician, told them:
''When I saw her in the ward I couldn't take it any more. She has a new
boyfriend.
''I only get to see my son every alternate weekend. He never wants to
go back, you can ask anyone.''
Staff nurse Patrick Gordon, 34, of Irvine, Ayrshire, who had been Ms
Duffy's new boyfriend, said in court that Mr McGowan did not know of his
relationship with Ms Duffy after she left the accused to live with her
parents.
He told Advocate-depute Ronald Clancy, prosecuting, how Mr McGowan had
later fought with him when he found out Ms Duffy had stayed overnight
with him in the nurses' home.
He said Mr McGowan subjected Irene to threats and she was angry
initially at the amount of access granted by a court to Mr McGowan for
his son, Christopher.
Nurse Margaret Lang, 35, said Mr McGowan telephoned Ms Duffy up to 20
times a night at her ward.
She said he also threatened her by drawing his finger across his
throat in a cutting gesture when he passed her in the hospital corridor.
Ms Duffy died of massive blood loss after being knifed through the
heart, liver, lungs, and spleen.
Pathologist Dr Marie Cassidy said Ms Duffy also had many cuts and
stabs to her arms where she tried in vain to defend herself. She had
also been stabbed in the head and face, chest and back, arms and legs,
and both lungs had collapsed.
One wound went through her chest to the back of her throat, said Dr
Cassidy.
Earlier, the court heard how Mr McGowan allegedly walked into Ward 2A
on a Sunday evening while visitors were still there and carried out the
attack.
Dr Lech Rymaszewski told Mr Clancy he heard nurses screaming and ran
to help.
He said: ''I found Irene lying in a pool of blood behind the desk of
the nursing station. I felt her pulse and her eyes rolled back and I
thought she was dead and I pressed on her heart to try to revive her.''
The doctor told how Ms Duffy was taken to the intensive care unit
where consultant surgeon John Smith and doctors and nurses began an
on-the-spot operation to try to stem the bleeding.
Minutes earlier, Dr Rymaszewski told how Ms Duffy came round and
started to struggle.
He said: ''She said she was sore and then said: 'I am not going to
die. Please don't let me die'.''
She told another nurse hours before she was killed that she had
forgotten to give the couple's three-year-old son to Mr McGowan for
Father's Day.
The trial continues.

Bihac
BOSNIANS are going bananas about bananas. In spite of many
deprivations, the once-forgotten yellow fruit symbolising pre-war luxury
is making a comeback as the hottest-selling commodity.
Suddenly bananas are everywhere in this north Bosnian town which broke
out of a three-and-a-half-year Serb siege in August.
''It's because we've had no bananas for three years and we loved them
before,'' said a seller at the main market. She said the banana had
recently taken on a cult status in Bihac.
After years of siege and utter deprivation, worrying about what to eat
to survive, or who got killed and what would happen tomorrow, the
inhabitants of Bihac buy bananas with abandon.
''We are selling two boxes a day,'' said a woman in a kiosk next to
the busiest of Bihac's three hotels.
She is one in a line of hawkers selling Marlborough cigarettes,
Coca-Cola in large plastic bottles, cans of Austrian beer, and lots of
big fat bananas.
In the market, they fetch 1.5 marks a kilo (40p per pound). Fresh,
hard, shiny yellow bananas without a single blemish sell for up to two
marks (80p).
Everybody seems to be eating them. A girl strolls down a gravel path
in a city park on the bank of the Una River, enjoying a tasty bite on a
sunny afternoon.
A bunch of soldiers in a frontline town crowd around an improvised
store with nothing but bananas on display. Tough men in uniform armed to
their teeth peel and chew them with religious devotion.
Next minute they are on a bus and off to the front line, leaving a
pile of banana skins on the sidewalk.
A tall, skinny soldier with a killer's face under a red beret stuffs
his mouth with a banana.
Edin Besic, a Bosnian army soldier in his early thirties, thinks there
is a political reason for the banana bonanza.
During the siege, the people of this mainly-Muslim enclave fought
Bosnian Serbs, as well as Serbs from the neighbouring Krajina region of
Croatia, and renegade Moslems loyal to the maverick former chieftain of
a nearby town, Fikret Abdic.
Of the three enemies, the people of Bihac most detested Abdic's
break-away state in Velika Kladusa, which they dubbed Autonomija
(Autonomy).
''During the Autonomy, their Radio Velkaton would tease us all the
time by saying 'You have nothing and we have plenty of bananas','' said
Besic, a machinegun mechanic.
''But the 'Autonomy' has fallen and we are here, and we have bananas
now and they don't,'' he said, smiling triumphantly.--Reuter.

Sarajevo
THE lights came on in many parts of the city as night fell and people
were overcome with joy at what others in the rest of Europe take for
granted.
''This is madness, this is beautiful,'' said Mirsada Burazerovic, 31,
after gas and electricity flowed into the besieged Bosnian capital after
a seven-month blockade.
''I've been washing childen and myself, I've been washing clothes,
I've been cooking, I've been ironing and I've been vacuum cleaning.
''For the first time we are able to heat up the house properly because
we were saving the firewood for cooking. I'm in a hurry to finish
dusting so I can relax,'' she said.
Utilities were restored to Sarajevo under the ceasefire accord reached
last week between the Muslim-led government and the separatist Serb
forces surrounding the city.
They arrived just too late for the truce to be implemented this
morning but the two sides look ready to announce a ceasefire from
tomorrow morning at one minute past midnight.
Sarajevans have been without most basic utilities for most of the
42-month war. They have endured three bitter, miserable winters having
to chop up furniture for firewood and brave snipers to fetch water.
It could be several days before water starts running through
everybody's household taps again, UN officials said.
This afternoon, people were still queuing up at UN tankers for water.

LABOUR councils will be warned by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
today to put their house in order or face the consequences.
He is due to deliver his condemnation of excesses by Labour-controlled
local authorities at a fringe meeting at the Tory conference today but
last night he took the unusual step of issuing the text in advance and
adding hard-hitting, off-the-cuff comments.
He has argued in the three months since he took over as Scottish
Secretary that the Government is prepared to devolve power down to local
authorities provided that they accept responsibility for their
activities. ''Judging by the rhetoric of the party leadership, it is a
deal New Labour should have no difficulty in grasping but many in Old
Labour will find it difficult to take.''
His speech today outlines a catalogue of excess:
* In the new Dundee unitary authority 36 councillors will run up a
bill of #441,000 in allowances -- a 54% increase on the old council.
* Inverclyde will spend almost #1m on the salaries of 20 executives --
almost one official for every councillor.
* Other widespread practices such as partisan packing of council
committees by ruling groups and manipulation of standing orders.
''Such conduct cannot be tolerated,'' he will claim today. ''It is a
cancer at the heart of democracy. It is precisely because I value local
government, because I recognise its crucial contribution to our
communities, and because I desperately want to see it play a flagship
role in the devolving of power to our people that I so utterly deplore
its abuses.''
He said that if Labour councillors were sincere in their complaints
about having insufficient powers, they must seize this, the most
significant opportunity for local government in decades, and ''must
reform themselves, quickly and thoroughly''. He made clear if Cosla or
the councils themselves did not act he was prepared to act unilaterally.
Questioned last night on just what these powers were, he said that one
complaint, relating to the appointment of a senior official in the new
North Lanarkshire authority, already was being investigated.
Meanwhile, the war of words over the state of the Scottish economy
escalated yesterday after Tory chairman Sir Michael Hirst claimed that
the Government had transformed it into the leading part of the United
Kingdom.
His claim that Tory policies had revitalised the Scottish economy to a
state ''unthinkable 25 years ago'' brought an angry response from
Opposition parties who contrasted this with the Government statistics
released on Monday indicating that without subsidies from the Exchequer
Scotland would be #8000m in the red.
Speaking in advance of today's debate on education and employment, Sir
Michael told the press in Blackpool: ''Under the Conservatives,
Scotland's economy has been transformed and revitalised. We are now in
an economic position which would have been unthinkable 25 years ago.''

Last Serb-held town in north-west Bosnia captured as foes capitalise
on truce plans.
Zagreb
BOSNIAN Croat troops captured the last Serb-held town along a
strategic road in the north-west of Bosnia today, Croatian state radio
and television said.
Mrkonjic Grad, just 25 miles south of the Bosnian Serb stronghold of
Banja Luka, fell in the afternoon after a two-week siege by Bosnian
government and Croat forces, the broadcasts claimed.
''Sources at the Bosnian Croat defence ministry stated that Croat
forces took control of Mrkonjic Grad and its wider area,'' the radio
said. The televison's main evening news programme showed Croatian
soldiers and tanks from the 4th Split Brigade in the town.
The Bosnian Serb army admitted that Mrkonjic Grad had fallen and
blamed the regular Croatian army for the seizure of the key town in
western Bosnia.
''Our army has withdrawn from Mrkonjic Grad this morning after
incessant bombardment and it was a ghost town until this afternoon when
the regular Croatian army entered it,'' said a source close to the BSA
command.
The source said fighting was also raging around Sanski Most: ''Reports
from the battlefield are contradictory, but it appears that pitched
battles are being fought as close as three miles from the town centre.''
The source added that Croatian artillery was shelling Krupa on Vrbas,
some 18 miles south-west of Banja Luka.
The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported more than 40 people,
including an entire surgical team in the town hospital, killed in the
shelling of Mrkonjic Grad. It blamed Croatian artillery.
SRNA also said two civilians were killed and four wounded in a Muslim
artillery attack on Sanski Most today.
European Union and UN sources in the north-west Bosnian city of Bihac
said earlier that the Bosnian Government Army was pressing on with a
last-minute land-grab in north-west Bosnia ahead of a US-brokered
ceasefire due to start at midnight.
Bosnian Croats and Croatian army troops are allied with the government
forces against the Serbs, who lost large swathes of territory in western
Bosnia in the last month.
''Croatia is not a signatory of the ceasefire deal and is taking
maximal advantage of the fact,'' said a UN source. The United States has
said it was confident that Croatia would abide by the ceasefire
agreement due to take effect within hours.
Mrkonjic Grad was the last town in Serb hands straddling a vital road
linking Bihac with central Bosnia. Other towns -- Donji Vakuf, Jajce,
Kljuc, and Bosanski Petrovac -- were seized in a stunning offensive by
the mainly-Muslim government army and by Croat forces last month.
Western military observers, whose movements were restricted because of
fighting, said government troops could still meet strong Serb resistance
around Sanski Most.
Few government soldiers believed the war could turn against them now
but optimism about their advance was still reserved.
''The Serbs are in disarray, but we know we can't liberate everything
before the ceasefire. This is just the first step, the ceasefire will
come and then we'll see,'' a soldier said.
UNITED NATIONS: Yasushi Akashi, the chief UN civilian representative
in the former Yugoslavia, is leaving his post at the end of the month at
his own request.
The Japanese diplomat, who has been in the Balkans for nearly two
years, will be replaced temporarily by Kofi Annan, the Ghanaian
undersecretary-general in charge of peacekeeping.--Reuter.

Brussels
NATO is expected to approve a plan to send up to 60,000 troops into
Bosnia to enforce any peace that emerges from a planned ceasefire,
Alliance sources said today.
The plan, being drawn up by the Alliance's military committee, will be
passed to Nato's policy-making Council of Ambassadors.
''It is a concept of operations,'' an Alliance source said. ''It is
not a complete plan down to the finest details but a general
framework.''
''There is obviously a lot of urgency now,'' the source explained,
saying the plan would set the duration of the operation, composition,
and size of the proposed force and its command structure. It would also
detail five main points of entry into the region.
''The military will recommend a robust approach. The temptation is to
send in a lot of troops quickly on the grounds that it may cost less in
the long run than some sort of creeping incremental approach,'' the
source said.
Three of the five main points of entry in the plan are Zagreb, Split
and Ploce in Croatia. At least one of the others is through Serbia,
Alliance sources said.
If the plan is accepted, General George Joulwan, Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe, will formally approach contributing countries --

of troops.
An Alliance source stressed that, although Mr Joulwan had already made
informal approaches, he now needed formal authority on use of troops and
use of Croatian and Serbian territory.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Employers warn of construction industry slump while survey shows house prices falling. Deeper recession risks 20,000 jobs</HEADLINE>

THE construction industry is slumping into an even deeper recession
and 20,000 jobs could disappear in the next six months, employers warned
yesterday.
Underlining the crisis, a leading building society's survey showed
house prices falling almost everywhere in the UK in the past quarter.
In a third development, the Construction Industry Training Board
announced it is slashing its intake because of builders' dwindling
workload.
The bad news was accompanied by calls for urgent Government action,
adding to the pressure on Ministers addressing the Tories' conference at
Blackpool this week.
According to the Building Employers' Confederation, as many as 20,000
construction jobs could be lost in Britain between now and next Spring,
taking the total number which have gone since 1990 to more than 500,000.
Chairman Paul Shepherd said the results of the confederation's latest
quarterly survey showed that the industry was continuing to deteriorate
and that there was no expectation of any early improvement.
''Unless early action is taken to boost construction, then 1996 is
likely to see the industry in continuing recession and it does not need
me to spell out the political implications of this. The forthcoming
Budget provides a last opportunity to stimulate construction activity.
It is essential that this is seized.''
The Scottish Building Employers' Federation, whose own surveys are
incorporated in the confederation's reports, said the last two quarters
had shown falls in output, work in hand, and inquiries.
Director Bob Campbell said: ''These results are extremely
disappointing. We had thought we were over the worst of the downturn
and, although there was no sign of a major recovery, we had hoped things
would not get any worse.
''We are now looking at the bleak prospect of a further shedding of
labour by builders of all sizes.''
He estimated possible job losses of between 1000 and 3000 in Scotland
in the next few months.
The most disturbing feature was that the dearth of inquiries appeared
to have hit all areas of activity, he said. Even the building of houses
for sale, previously more buoyant than in the rest of the UK, was
showing signs of slowing down.
With no shortage of mortgage finance and house prices holding steady,
there had never been a better time to buy. The one thing that appeared
to be missing was public confidence in the economic future.
Specific measures his organisation want the Government to take
includes improved mortgage interest tax relief for first-time buyers, to
help kick-start the housing market.
On public expenditure, Mr Campbell warned that any further cuts in
capital programmes would be ''fatal''.
Meanwhile, figures published yesterday by the Halifax Building Society
show average house prices in Scotland fell by 2.2% between the second
and third quarter of this year and by 1.4% between the third quarter of
last year and the same period this year.
The UK as a whole saw a quarter-on-quarter drop of 1% and a
year-on-year reduction of 2.6%. Across the UK, only three out of 12
''regions'' showed a quarter-on-quarter increase, and only Northern
Ireland enjoyed a year-on-year rise.
Mr John Donaldson, regional general manager for Scotland, said prices
had held up well north of the Border over the past three or four years,
in contrast to what had been happening elsewhere.
He said: ''While it is disappointing to see a fall recorded in house
prices this quarter, we are confident prices in Scotland will remain
stable over the year. Consumer confidence is essential for a healthy
housing market and lenders have played their part by reducing interest
rates.
''It is to be hoped the Government will also respond, by introducing
some positive measures in the Budget to help restore confidence.''
The Halifax is urging the Government to scrap stamp duty and replace
mortgage interest tax relief with a once-only home-buyer's grant.
In another development, the Construction Industry Training Board
yesterday announced that it has revised its target intakes for 1996-97
and 1997-98. Instead of budgeting for 15,000 entrants in each of the two
years, as recommended in a strategic review carried out in December last
year, the board will be looking to recruit no more than 10,500 a year.
Chairman Sir Clifford Chetwood said original targets had been based on
assumptions of an increasing industry workload. Work prospects had
reduced significantly since the beginning of this year and 1996 offered
no hint of improvement.
The decision comes just days after Sir Clifford warned that the
industry was in serious decline and accused the Government of having
done little to help it in six years of recession.

A COOK who claimed she was made redundant from her job after only two
months because she was pregnant has been awarded #2690 compensation.
Miss Angela Bryce claimed the reason for her dismissal from Kalooki's,
of Carlisle Road, Airdrie, was her pregnancy but owner Fred Burton said
she was made redundant because of a downturn in business and denied sex
discrimination.
Miss Bryce, of Kennedy Drive, Airdrie, told a Glasgow industrial
tribunal she was kept on permanently after a week's trial.
However, less than two weeks later, she found out she was pregnant.
She told her manager, Miss Jean Burton, explaining she would need time
off to attend ante-natal clinics.
Miss Burton said this would give some difficulty in relation to her
working hours at the bar/diner. She was given time off for one clinic
but had to make up the hours by working late.
She suffered from morning sickness and headaches at work and went off
sick after she was involved in a car accident. Her doctor gave her a
two-week sick line.
On the same day her line was received, her P45 and a week's pay were
delivered to her father's house. She was given no reason for her
dismissal.
The tribunal said it was of the view that, as a probability, the true
reason for her dismissal was her pregnancy. Mr Burton could offer no
explanation whatsoever for the strange and unexpected downturn in this
apparently well planned and at first successful new business.

RYANAIR has been threatened with legal action by British Midland, two
weeks before it launches its low-price air service between Prestwick and
Stansted Airport.
The UK's second largest domestic carrier has warned that, if the Irish
airline does not stop using the designation Glasgow Prestwick in its
promotional material, it will report it to the Director General of Fair
Trading and the Advertising Standards Authority.
British Midland's solicitor has also said that it may go to the High
Court to seek damages for any loss which may arise.
In a second move, which industry observers see as the first salvoes in
what may become a price war, British Midland has announced that it will
match Ryanair's #59 fare on its route from Glasgow to London Heathrow.
Midland competes directly with British Airways on the Heathrow service.
The UK subsidiary of Ryanair announced last month that, after several
delays cause by regulatory difficulties, it was to introduce a low-cost,
no-frills service between Prestwick and Stansted from October 26. Fares
will range from #59 to #99 return, with free rail travel to and from
Prestwick and a cheap link at the other end with Liverpool Street
station.
At first British Midland welcomed the new competition, but now its
solicitor, Mr Kevin Bodley, has contacted Ryanair with a clear warning.
He writes: ''Whilst your flights are scheduled from Stansted to
Prestwick, your advertising campaign description is 'Glasgow to London'.
This gives the clear impression that the flight is to be from Glasgow
Airport, whilst Prestwick is some 35 miles away. British Midland form
the view that such claims are clearly misleading in breach of, inter
alia, the Control of Misleading Advertising Regulations 1988, Article 2
(2).''
The lawyer gives Ryanair an ultimatum, which has just passed, and says
that, after that, a report will be made ''and further action
considered''.
Mr Tim Jeans, chief executive of Ryanair UK, has responded by saying
that his company remains comfortable with the advertising campaign,
which was cleared by the CAA in advance, and that he would welcome the
opportunity to make a submission to the Director General of Fair
Trading.
He said last night: ''I was astonished to read the letter from British
Midland as I had always considered them to be the great champions of
competition in the airline business.
''I have made it clear to Mr Bodley that Prestwick is one of the two
designated Glasgow airports under IATA regulations and we have no
hesitation in using that designation in our literature, just as our
sister company has done for over a year on the Dublin routes.''
Mr Jeans disclosed that over 5000 bookings had been taken already for
the new service.

A ''DANGEROUS'' 16-year-old joyrider who stole a powerful jeep, drove
it at two policemen, then careered through busy streets at speeds of up
to 80mph was ordered to be detained for seven years yesterday.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, told Stephen McGuire, who committed
the offences when he was just 15, that the public must be protected from
his ''quite intolerable'' behaviour.
McGuire was convicted of two sets of offences, both involving stolen
vehicles.
Mr Iain Bonomy QC, Advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh,
that McGuire, of Linthaugh Road, Pollok, Glasgow, reset a Rover which
had been stolen in Glasgow in December 1993.
A 42-year-old company director, Mr Donald Findlay, returned to his
parked car in Kensington Gate, Glasgow, to find McGuire sitting in the
driver's seat.
He was with another juvenile whom Mr Findlay grabbed by the scruff of
the neck. As McGuire got out of the car and into the Rover the juvenile
called out to him to ''cosh'' Mr Findlay.
McGuire drove the Rover towards Mr Findlay, pinning him by the legs to
the side of his own car.
Mr Findlay was taken to hospital suffering from extensive bruising and
ligament damage to both knees and was on crutches for two weeks.
Mr Bonomy said the second set of offences involved the accused's
23-year-old cousin, James McGuire, of Fernbank Street, Springburn,
Glasgow.
A Mitsubishi Shogun four-wheel-drivewas stolen on May 25 this year and
was seen on the M8 motorway the following evening.
Miss Sarah Osborne, 22, was driving near the Hillington slipway when
the Shogun pulled alongside her with Stephen at the wheel.
James was in the front passenger seat and leaned out of the window
brandishing a metal bar. He also pulled his finger across his throat in
a threatening gesture.
The Shogun carried on to a McDonald's drive-through restaurant in
Springburn Road, where two teenagers in the car park had taken an
interest in the vehicle.
James leaped out and chased one of them with an axe he had taken from
the Shogun. While the youth sheltered in the doorway of the restaurant,
James got back into the vehicle and Stephen drove off at high speed.
Police traced the Shogun, later that night, to a disused farm at
Robroyston.
Two constables, Patrick Cloherty and Brian Gallagher, got out of their
car and walked towards the vehicle. They were about 10 feet away when it
accelerated towards them.
Mr Bonomy said both officers had to jump out of the way.
A high-speed chase followed in which Stephen McGuire drove through
busy streets at up to 80 mph, through red lights, on the wrong side of
the road, round roundabouts the wrong way, weaving in and out of traffic
and causing other cars to swerve to avoid being hit.
The sheriff who had remitted the case to the High Court because he
felt his maximum sentencing power of three years was inadequate had seen
the high-speed chase on a police video and described the driving as
''horrifying''.
Mr William Thom, defence counsel for Stephen McGuire, said his client
was a young man with a very unhappy background.
He described the ''sad state of affairs'' in which McGuire had been
known to the social work department from the age of eight and offending
since 1992 when he had been generally out of control.
Mr Paul Burns, solicitor advocate, for James, said his client played
the minor role in the incidents involving the Shogun.
Lord Ross sentenced Stephen McGuire to seven years' detention and
banned him from driving for 10 years.
The judge jailed James for nine months.

THE BBC's new charter will require the corporation to observe the same
standards of taste, decency and impartiality which now apply to
independent broadcasters.
Announcing this at the Conservative conference yesterday, Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, Heritage Secretary, said the BBC was deservidly praised
throughout the world for the quality of its programmes.
''But the excellent standing abroad must never be compromised by bias
or distortion at home,'' she added.
After her speech, she denied that the move was a sign of ministerial
annoyance about anti-Government bias in some BBC programmes. She said it
was right that the same standards should apply to all broadcasters.
Mrs Bottomley said the freedom the media enjoyed ''must never be a
licence to distort with propaganda or pollute with smut and gratuitous
violence''.
Meanwhile, the BBC was at the centre of a new political row yesterday
after a key news bulletin was delayed by 11 minutes to continue live
coverage of a party conference speech by Tory chairman Dr Brian
Mawhinney.
Labour reacted with fury to the ''unprecedented and unacceptable''
decision to put back the time of the television One O'Clock News and
accused the corporation of caving in to Tory pressure.
Deputy Labour leader John Prescott wrote to BBC director-general John
Birt demanding an explanation for its treatment of the speech on the
opening day of the conference.
The row followed an attempt last week by Mr Alastair Campbell, press
secretary to Mr Tony Blair, to put pressure on both the BBC and ITN to
lead bulletins with reports of the Labour leader's speech on the day of
the O J Simpson trial verdict.
The BBC on that occasion led its programmes with the Blair speech --
but fiercely denied it had bowed to pressure.
Mr Prescott said yesterday: ''I am writing to John Birt for an
explanation of the extraordinary decision by the BBC to delay the One
O'Clock news so that Brian Mawhinney's speech to the Tory conference
could be broadcast in full.
''This is unprecedented and totally unacceptable and further proof
that the BBC caves in to Tory pressure.''
He said the reputation of the BBC had been damaged by the decision.
BBC insiders later said the organisation twice had scrapped news
bulletins altogether during last week's Labour conference -- for
speeches by Mr Prescott and Mr Blair.
An official statement said: ''The BBC is committed to extensive live
coverage of the main party conferences as part of its public service
role.
''The decision to delay the start of the One O'Clock News by a few
minutes was made when Dr Mawhinney's keynote speech as party chairman
overran because of an earlier technical problem in the conference hall.
''The decision was made on editorial grounds. It was an entirely
reasonable one in the circumstances and was made by the BBC alone.
''No representations were made by the Conservative Party about the
scheduling of the One O'Clock News.''

THE Government is to seek the creation of a huge Atlantic Free Trade
Community uniting the European Union and the North American Free Trade
Area of the US, Canada and Mexico.
This was announced by Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind to the Tory
conference yesterday. It is an initiative which the Prime Minister sees
as a way of broadening the debate on Europe in a way that could help
relieve tensions within his party on European integration.
However, the foreign affairs debate was dominated by Euro-sceptics,
who demanded that the Government reject a single European currency and
the transfer of any further powers to Brussels.
Mr Rifkind won most applause when he proclaimed: ''Britain is an
Atlantic nation as well as a European nation.''
He admitted that it would be difficult to achieve complete free trade
between the two huge continental economies which already have $400bn
invested in each other's economy, creating three million jobs on each
side of the ocean.
Mr Rifkind warned that there were strong protectionist tendencies
within both the EU and the US and it would be essential that the reform
of the European Common Agricultural Policy became an even greater
priority.
However, he added: ''The rewards of success will be enormous in terms
of jobs, trade and prosperity.''
He said there was strong support for the policy from some of Britain's
European partners and interests in the US. ''Atlantic Free Trade will be
a major objective of this Government and our party.''
Mr Rifkind pleased the sceptics by saying there was no logic in the
proposition that to protect the benefits of European co-operation the
nation states of Europe must go down a path of ever closer union until
they became the nation state of Europe.
However, he pleased them less when he argued that proposals for
further integration should be judged by ''a cool assessment of where the
balance of British interest is to be found''.
Integration could go ahead he said, if, as in the case of the single
market, the Government decided that the benefits to the prosperity,
security or quality of life of the British people justified the loss of
national control over decision making.
However, if there would be no such benefits, as with the Social
Chapter or the abolition of frontier controls, the Government would say
no.
Pressure for a stronger Euro-sceptic line came from several speakers
from the floor.
Sir Robert Morland (Greater London) said: ''The move for a common
currency is being driven by a political not an economic gender. I think
it is time for us to make clear that there is no way we can remain a
sovereign state in a Europe with a common currency.''
Dumfries prospective candidate Struan Stevenson bucked the trend by
saying he would be willing to accept a common foreign policy and
scrapping the national veto in return for a strong subsidiarity policy,
thorough reform of the CAP, and a serious attack on Community fraud.
However, Mr Michael Kenyon (London North-East) called on the
Government to demand an end to growth in the EU budget and that all
European laws should be applied evenly to every member state. They
should also say no to economic and monetary union.
Mr Nicholas Cambrook, prospective candidate for Yeovil, said only the
Conservative Party was prepared to debate Europe.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats were ''keeping their heads down,
hoping the public won't ask them what they believe in.''
Mr Matthew Jeffrey (Tonbridge and Malling) said a single currency
leading to a single central bank, a single finance minister, and a
single government, was ''a road we don't want to take''. He called for
the issue to be put to a referendum.
He said it was time to echo Lady Thatcher and say ''no,'' to any
further expansion of European powers.
The representatives approved a motion calling on the Government to aim
at building ''an open, flexible, free trading and decentralised European
Union.''

AN English property group yesterday began a bid to develop Kilbowie
Park, home of Clydebank Football Club.
Vico Property Company is applying for permission to establish a retail
and leisure complex at the ground.
The Clydebank club are proposing to move to a new stadium on a
greenfield site near Great Western Road Boulevard following the sale of
Kilbowie, believed to be for #2m.
Yesterday's meeting of Clydebank District Council's planning committee
was held in private but councillors continued the matter in order to
make an inspection of the site.
Councillors are understood to be sympathetic to the application,
although nearby residents are concerned it will generate more traffic.
The council is anxious to attract more investment to jobs-starved
Clydebank, especially since two of the town's biggest retailers have
revealed plans to move to Glasgow's new shopping development at the
former Goodyear tyre factory site at Drumchapel.
DIY operators B&amp;Q and Cantors, the furniture store, are closing their
operations at the Clyde Shopping Centre, adjacent to Kilbowie Park.
The application submitted by Vico involves the construction of four
outlets ranging from 25,000sq ft to 7500sq ft, with parking for 289
vehicles.
The new stadium for Clydebank FC, planned to be all-seater, might be
named after the late soccer player Davie Cooper, who died earlier this
year after collapsing with a brain haemorrhage.

DEFENCE Secretary Michael Portillo yesterday disclosed that he will
announce details of a new rapid deployment force next week.
The group of 20,000 will be capable of speedy and long-range
deployment to meet new threats outside Western Europe.
The move follows the 1994 Front Line First review that first outlined
plans for a new tri-Service strike force.
It will combine the fighting strengths of units such as the Royal
Marines, the Parachute Regiment and 24 Airmobile Brigade, which is in
the process of returning from the former Yugoslavia.
Recent procurement decisions significantly will increase the force's
military might.
The airmobile brigade will receive the Apache attack helicopter from
1998.
The Marines' amphibious operations will be substantially enhanced with
the arrival of the helicopter assault ship HMS Ocean, which will be
launched today.
The force will include RAF warplanes, escort frigates and destroyers
and submarines to be equipped ultimately with Tomahawk cruise missiles.
LORD Home of The Hirsel will be buried on Saturday in a private
ceremony, his family said yesterday. The Conservative Prime Minister
from 1963 to 1964 died on Monday, aged 92. He will be laid to rest
alongside his wife Elizabeth, who died in 1990. Lord Home's father is
also buried in the family plot at the Lennel churchyard in Coldstream,
Berwickshire.
MEMBERS of the Government were urged at the conference yesterday to
keep their trousers on. Mr Matthew Jeffery, from Gravesham, Kent, said:
''I hope members of the Government use their intelligence in the run-up
to the election, and keep their belt buckles fastened and their zips up.
Please, no more sleaze, no more scandals. ''You're there to represent
the people, not take advantage of them.'' He said the media's portrayal
of the Conservative Party made him ''sad''.
A SCHOOLBOY aged 14 who wants to be Prime Minister and is said to be
''more right-wing than Margaret Thatcher'', is set to make a
barnstorming speech to the conference today. Justin Hinchcliffe, from
north London, has a tough agenda -- including more hospital closures and
no increases in state benefits for the sick and elderly -- which will
anger the Tory left. If he is called to speak, he will beat the record
set by William Hague, now Welsh Secretary, who won Baroness Thatcher's
approval with his conference speech when he was 16.
TORY Party members cheered as one speaker hailed the supremacy of
pints, pounds and acres over ''Euro-metrification''. The enthusiastic
reception given to Mr Nick Herbert's remarks was typical of that
accorded to any criticism of Brussels red tape in yesterday's debates.
Mr Herbert is prospective parliamentary candidate for
Berwick-upon-Tweed.
MOST Scots -- and most Scottish Tories -- would prefer money to be
spent on education instead of tax cuts, an opinion poll suggested
yesterday. The preference runs straight across party lines, according to
the public sector union Unison, which commissioned the System Three
poll. Asked what money should be spent on if more resources were
available, 69% of those questioned opted for investment in education and
only 28% for tax cuts.

THE deadline on bids for Rosyth naval base closed yesterday, leaving
the Government to choose between four consortia.
All four were asked to resubmit offers after the inital selection
process had reduced the number from six. They are believed to be
Clydeport, a Saudi Arabian investment company and port operator, a
British property company, and Rosyth 2000, a local consortium headed by
Sir Bob Reid.
The 355-acre site, the largest industrial property to come on the
market in Scotland for years and expected to raise more than #15m, will
become vacant next April when the Royal Navy pulls out, retaining only a
minor presence.
Defence Procurement Minister James Arbuthnot has indicated that a
decision on the bids would be announced by the end of next week.

Last night, Tory Euro-MPs reacted by complaining officially to the
Prime Minister over what they considered were unhelpful remarks by Mr
Portillo, which they claimed contradicted official Government policy.
Some MPs on the pro-European wing of the party expressed reservations
over the tone of Mr Portillo's speech, which drew an extended standing
ovation and repeated interruptions for applause from conference
delegates.
Mr Portillo roamed far from his brief to attack moves to greater
European integration.
However, he kept his Euro-scepticism within the bounds of Cabinet
loyalty: ''While John Major is Prime Minister, Malcolm Rifkind is at the
Foreign Office, and I am Secretary of State for Defence, the foreign and
defence policies of this country will not be dictated to us by a
majority vote of a Council of Ministers. Would it have given Britain
permission to retake the Falkland Islands? No way.''
He raised the prospect of the European Commission attempting to
harmonise uniforms and cap badges across Europe and of the European
Court trying to limit British soldiers to fighting just 40 hours a week.
Although tongue-in-cheek, his remarks drew cheers from delegates.
''There are those, in the Labour Party and across Europe, sleep
walking their way along the dreamy road to a European superstate. We
will not allow Brussels to control our defence policy. Britain will not
be told when to fight and when not to fight,'' he said.
Afterwards, angry Euro-MPs pointed out that the Maastricht Treaty
specifically excluded defence and foreign policy from the European
Commission's competence, and suggested that Mr Portillo was exaggerating
the situation to pander to Tory party prejudices.
Mr Portillo accused Labour of being weak on defence and said: ''The
defence of Britain is something you either feel in your heart, in your
bones, in your gut, or you don't. The Labour Party doesn't. Mr Blair
doesn't. But the British people do''
Shadow Defence Secretary David Clark said: ''It is a disgrace for
Michael Portillo to suggest that to be a patriot, you have to be a Tory.
Many thousands of people who are not Tories have fought and died for
this country.''
Mr Blair said in a statement: ''Many Tories are seriously suggesting
that Britain pulls out of Europe altogether.
''That would be bad for British jobs and bad for British business.
Speech after speech will pander to anti-European sentiment, ignoring the
effect it will have on this country.
''Nothing showed that more clearly than Mr Portillo's extreme,
juvenile and ill-informed anti-European tirade, which showed a complete
ignorance of Britain's defence history and defence needs.''
Meanwhile, former Chancellor Norman Lamont told a conference fringe
meeting that the argument against a European single currency was gaining
ground in the party and the country.
He predicted the shift in opinion would continue for the rest of the
decade.
Mr Lamont, who stunned last year's Tory Party conference with a call
to consider withdrawal from the EU, yesterday claimed the time would
come ''when you won't find a single person in favour of single European
currency or a federal Europe -- they are vanishing as fast as the snow
with the coming spring''.
Lord Tebbit yesterday told a meeting organised by the deeply
Euro-sceptic European Foundation group that the Tory Party was uniting
behind Euro-sceptic policies.
Only ''a few extremist'' Euro-enthusiasts now were failing to fall in
with the party's mainstream policies on Europe, he said.

AN MP has asked Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to force a health
board to clean up its act after it lost actions against a nursing home
in both civil and criminal courts.
The Labour MP for Renfrew West and Inverclyde, Mr Tommy Graham, is
demanding to know why the litigation costs were paid out of funds set
aside for patient care in his constituency. It is believed the costs
exceed #100,000.
The nursing home in question, Ardgryffe Manor, in Houston,
Renfrewshire, is run by Mr Michael Milton and his wife Gillian. They
suspect ''vindictive and mischievous'' litigation by the health board.
Mr Graham said yesterday: ''There was no need for this legal debacle.
I made every effort as an MP and as somebody with a background in social
work to arbitrate in a problem which could have been sorted out around a
table over a cup of tea and a biscuit.
''The fact that the whole nonsense was paid for out of funds set aside
for the care of the sick is appalling. I hope the Minister acts in this.
I intend to raise this matter at the highest level again.
''It is a tragedy that never should have happened. There is no
question where the money came from. I asked them more than once and the
chairman of the board admitted, 'out of patient care funds'.''
Mr Graham said he had visited the nursing home which employs a lot of
local women as nurses and care staff a number of times. ''I never ever
gave any warning. I just popped in. It was always superbly run with a
great enthusiastic staff and happy old folk.
''As far as I am concerned, this health board has been engaged in a
needless attack on my elderly constituents, threatening the security of
what is, after all, their home. They have caused terrible anxiety to
relatives as well as the workforce. This is a case of functionaries
running out of control.''
Mr Graham said: ''I am going to do all I can to have a proper
arbitration panel set up to stop this sort of scandalous waste of public
funds.''
Last night, a spokesman for the health board said: ''It has nothing to
do with the MP in question. These were matters of internal detail.''
He said that, as far as he knew, no action was being considered by his
board against officials responsible for pursuing the lengthy and costly
litigation against Mr Milton and his wife.
A spokesman at the Scottish Office said: ''The Minister will obviously
be looking into this matter raised by the MP and the people involved. He
will respond in due course.''
Mr Milton said yesterday that he had also written to Mr Forsyth to
complain.
A parallel inquiry carried out by the Scottish National Health Service
criticised the board's behaviour and reported to the then Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang.

GLASGOW District Council leader Pat Lally yesterday made light of the
latest troubles involving murals at the city's Royal Concert Hall.
He dismissed the fact that one artist had painted a mural the wrong
way up as ''just one of those things''.
The unveiling of three murals in a ceremony at the hall yesterday was
preceded by the introduction of a space where a fourth mural by artist
Peter Howson should have been. The picture was absent because Mr Howson
had painted it horizontally while those of his three colleagues were
correctly painted vertically.
''The first one we are going to unveil is probably the most
controversial of all the murals,'' said Mr Lally as the curtain was
drawn, revealing no more than a space on the wall of the main foyer.
''This is a minimalist painting,'' he joked, ''by a famous Glasgow
artist called How Soon. And the question is how soon will Peter Howson's
painting arrive in Glasgow so that we can put it on display?''
Mr Howson, who did not attend the ceremony, was said to be unavailable
for comment at the Flowers East gallery in London where he works but, in
answer to Mr Lally's question, it is believed he will complete a new
vertical mural by the end of the year and may sell the first, which
depicts three drummers.
The concert hall murals first ran into trouble five years ago when
works by Ian McCulloch, commissioned by Strathclyde Regional Council to
symbolise its involvement in the #34m venue, were taken down on the
instructions of Mr Lally and re-hung at the city's Tramway Theatre.
Peter Howson was then approached to fill the void left by McCulloch
but later pulled out of a #50,000 commission, citing moral concern and
fears his work would be watered down.
Mr Lally, who is chairman of the concert hall's board, said that, when
Mr Howson's mural arrived, the works would be a lasting tribute to four
of the city's finest artists and would be seen by future generations as
symbol's of the city's renaissance on the eve of the millenium.
He added that the four so-called New Glasgow Boys -- Howson, Adrian
Wiszniewski, Ken Currie, and Steven Campbell -- were each given details
of the scale of the murals and told they should be vertical but,
defending Mr Howson, ''it was some time ago and, I'm quite sure, like
any of us, you lose track of detail''.
Commissioned at a total cost of #45,000 by Glasgow Cultural
Enterprises Ltd, owners of the concert hall, the murals were sold by the
artists at lower than market prices.
Ken Currie's painting is of a choir and Adrian Wiszniewski's depicts a
string quartet, while Steven Campbell's is described as a fanciful
portrait of opera singer Joan Sutherland.

THE SNP yesterday named its national secretary as its candidate to
contest the marginal seat of former Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, at the
next General Election.
Mr Alasdair Morgan requires a swing of less than 3% to unseat the
President of the Board of Trade in Galloway and Upper Nithsdale.
It is a seat the SNP came close to winning in 1992 and was the party's
closest challenge to a sitting Conservative MP.
Mr Morgan, a close ally of leader Alex Salmond, is a long-serving
member of the party's chief executive and has held several senior posts.
The party is confident he can attain the 2.8% swing necessary to
defeat Mr Lang, who confounded several poll projections by retaining his
seat in 1992.
Yesterday, Mr Morgan said: ''Ian Lang held on to this seat by the skin
of his teeth in 1992 and Tory support is only half now what it was then.
''The two messages of my campaign will be the need to restore power to
Scotland through an independent parliament and to provide a strong and
effective voice for the constituency's interests.''
An SNP spokesman added: ''The electorate of Galloway and Upper
Nithsdale will no doubt relish the chance to take the scalp of Ian Lang
and kick out such a high-profile Tory.''
Mr Morgan, 49, from Aberfeldy, is a local government computer project
manager. He unsuccessfully challenged Ms Roseanna Cunningham for the
Perth and Kinross SNP candidacy in March.
The result for the constituency in April 1992, was: Con 42%, SNP
36.4%, Labour 13.0%, and Lib Dem 8.6%.

CASH from the National Lottery will not be used to replace Government
spending, Chief Secretary to the Treasury William Waldegrave pledged
yesterday.
The promise came after a newspaper published a leaked letter which
showed that National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley has rejected
a Treasury suggestion that cash from the lottery should be used to pay
for her department's #300m arts programme.
Mr Waldegrave said: ''Lottery funds will not be used to replace
ordinary Government spending.
''I can make it absolutely clear now that there is no question
whatsoever of breaking that pledge,'' he said on BBC Radio 4.
Mrs Bottomley warned Mr Waldegrave in the leaked letter, published in
yesterday's Guardian, that using lottery cash to replace Government
spending ''would represent the clearest possible broken promise''.
Ministers, including the Prime Minister, have pledged repeatedly that
the National Lottery would never be used to fund existing government
programmes.
In her letter, written three weeks ago, Mrs Bottomley rejected Mr
Waldegrave's suggestion that ''endowments be given to major arts
organisations in substitution for the revenue funding they receive from
the Arts Council''.
She told him: ''This option is not a runner. It would contradict the
many assurances we have given that lottery money would not be used to
relieve the government of its existing obligations.
''This commitment has been repeatedly given by members of the
Government from the Prime Minister downwards. The Opposition would milk
the broken promises theme for everything they can get.''
Mr Waldegrave had suggested that lottery cash should be used to set up
endowments from which annual interest could be used to fund arts
programmes which currently receive Government help.
Shadow National Heritage Secretary Chris Smith, who first received the
leaked letter, said: ''There is a secret agenda at work in the Treasury.
At the conference yesterday, Mrs Bottomley, in her speech, steered
clear of the row and instead gave an upbeat assessment of the lottery,
insisting it was ''the most successful in the world''.
She told representatives that the lottery was ''an unbeatable way of
raising extra cash to help good causes -- sport and the arts, the caring
charities and heritage, and to celebrate the millennium''.
Mrs Bottomley said: ''Well over an incredible #1 billion has now been
raised for the Good Causes Fund.
Questioned by journalists later on the lottery row, Mrs Bottomley
said: ''This is the time of year when affectionate correspondence
between Ministers and Treasury Ministers frequently takes place.
''The position is, as it was, that the lottery money is extra money.''
Pressed further, she would say only: ''I deplore leaks -- I don't
comment on leaks.''

THE leaders of Scotland's new councils have claimed financial disaster
is approaching if the Scottish Office does not take account of their
budget forecasts.
They have warned that 1996-97, the first year of the new single-tier
councils, promises to be the most difficult yet for local government.
The warnings come in the run-up to the November 28 Budget, in which
the Government is expected to cut public spending and reduce council
grant.
Cosla's Labour president, Councillor Rosemary McKenna, said yesterday
that the authorities faced a number of ''serious difficulties'' and
unless there was a major rethink by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth,
services would inevitably suffer.
For a start, Mrs McKenna said some of the new councils would inherit
deficits from the outgoing regional and district councils.
The Government's stated intention to reduce grant support for next
year, meant councils were already looking at an 8% rise in council tax.
Other factors -- including savings Ministers claimed could be made
from reorganisation but which Cosla believe are non existent -- meant
that increases would be even higher, she explained.
Mrs McKenna also attacked the Government's determination that, for the
third year running, staff pay awards must be funded from efficiency
savings.
''Unions have agreed below-inflation awards over the past two years
and we must expect them to seek to redress that this year.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said Ministers were aware of a number of
difficulties that would face local authorities as a result of
reorganisation. Discussions were under way with Cosla as to how best
these could be addressed.

ANTI-SOCIAL tenants in Scotland are to be banned from buying their own
home while in the process of being evicted, Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth announced last night.
Mr Forsyth said tenants who caused ''untold misery and distress to
their neighbours'' should not have the right to buy under such
circumstances.
''As things now stand, tenants can exercise their statutory right to
buy at any time up until they are evicted from the property and are no
longer entitled to live in it,'' Mr Forsyth said.
''I believe that there are now strong grounds to change that. I plan
to suspend a tenant's right to buy while eviction proceedings are taking
place.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night that if the tenants moved
on and behaved themselves, there would be nothing to stop them buying
that one at a later date.

Expert calls purchase 'scandalous'.
BRITAIN has bought millions of faulty Portuguese rifle bullets which
could put the lives of Servicemen at risk in places such as Bosnia, a
leading Scottish firearms expert claimed last night.
Mr Charles Young, a consultant to the National Rifle Association, said
the accuracy of the supposedly top-quality ammunition was
''disastrous'', and its purchase for use on active service ''utterly
scandalous''.
''British snipers would probably not survive if they had to use it in
a life-or-death situation. Its high failure rate and unreliability at
longer ranges would put these men's lives at risk,'' he said.
Earlier this year, the Ministry of Defence signed a two-year deal with
INDEP, a state-owned firm which uses low-paid Portuguese army conscripts
in its armaments plant to supply ''sniper-quality'' rounds for military
use at ranges of between 600 and 1200 metres.
The ammunition was intended for use by Army and Royal Marines
marksmen. Each sniper is equipped with individually tailored weapons
which cost #2000 apiece and are designed to pick off key targets at
extreme range.
INDEP reportedly undercut the UK's last remaining small arms
ammunition manufacturer, the Royal Ordnance factory at Radway Green,
Cheshire, by 30% to win the contract.
However, when a batch of the Portuguese rounds was supplied for use by
the National Rifle Association at the world-famous Bisley ranges in
July, hundreds of bullets failed to fire at all and the rest were
classified as unreliable.
The NRA appealed to Radway Green for help three days before the start
of its Imperial shooting competition. The UK company turned out
high-quality rounds for target shooting to allow the contest to go
ahead. Now the NRA is facing a bill for #100,000.
Mr Young, a leading critic of ammunition procurement policy for a
number of years, said: ''The Defence Ministry refused, unusually, to
allow NRA participation in the testing of the Portuguese ammunition at
the Pendine ranges in Wales earlier this year.
''They also failed to publish details of the performance trials,
saying simply that the ammunition met required criteria.
''However, the Ministry supplies the NRA with about 200,000 rounds of
sniper-quality ammunition each year in return for free use of the Bisley
ranges. Some of this was used at the traditional Commonwealth Rifle Club
open meeting in July in advance of the main Imperial competition.
''The results were catastrophic. The accuracy of the rounds at longer
ranges was disastrous.
''Worse, an enormous quantity simply failed to fire at all. Bearing in
mind the quantities purchased by MoD, and described by it as being 'of
superior quality', the matter is utterly scandalous.''
In contrast, the emergency batch turned out by Royal Ordnance to allow
the Bisley contest to go ahead produced scoring at record levels and no
misfires.
Radway Green, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, assembles rifle and
machine-gun ammunition for the British forces.
However, since 1993, the propellant powder for all UK bullets has been
supplied by a Dutch company, Muiden Chemie. The last British
manufacturer of the crucial propellant, the ICI plant at Powfoot, closed
the same year.
The all-party Commons Defence Select Committee report on the lessons
of the Gulf War had scathing criticism for the Government's ''market
force'' brand of defence procurement.
Its conclusions included a warning that it would be ''unwise'' to rely
on foreign sources for supplies of basic strategic materials.
No-one was available at the Defence Ministry last night for comment on
the allegations about the Portuguese ammuntion.

DOUNREAY yesterday confirmed that a further eight radioactive ''hot
spots'' had been found around the plant, making a total of 29 discovered
since the Atomic Energy Authority began its sweep of the site in July.
Meanwhile, Western Isles Labour MP Calum Macdonald has called on the
Scottish Office to investigate why a ship carrying plutonium nitrate
from the Caithness plant set sail for Sellafield at the weekend via the
Minch, which was being lashed by gales.
The most recent metallic particles found at Dounreay, similar to those
found on the foreshore, have now been removed by the team conducting the
sweep. About 85 patches of lightly contaminated ground have also been
discovered.
Some have been cleaned up but the majority have not and they have been
fenced off. The latest monitoring also detected a spot of low-level
contamination on the seat of a general purpose van.
According to Mr Ian Shepherd, AEA spokesman at Dounreay, none of this
radioactive pollution endangered either the workforce or the public. He
said the hot-spots were believed to have originated from defective
containers which had been used to take material from Dounreay's
reprocessing complex to the waste shaft for storage in the 1960s and
early 1970s.
''These latest finds are consistent with that theory. The survey work
has been delayed because of the recent wet period but it should be
completed by Christmas. After it is completed, the results will be
analysed and a programme drawn up for removing all the contamination
which has not already been cleaned up.''
The fresh finds have renewed the calls from anti-nuclear campaigners
for the site to be closed down until the clean-up is completed. Mrs
Lorraine Mann, of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping said Dounreay was
trying to play down the danger.
''If you remember, Dr Tom Wheldon of the Committee on Medical Aspects
of Radiation in the Environment said of the particles on the foreshore
that, if you ingested one and it moved to your gut, you would probably
be dead within a week of gastro-intestinal burns.'' She said there had
to be concerns that some of the contamination had been taken off site.
Meanwhile, Mr Macdonald has written to Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth complaining about the cargo of plutonium nitrate.
Mr Macdonald tells Mr Forsyth: ''Such shipments are of concern at even
the best of times because of the potential for environmental disaster
should any accident occur. To send a relatively small vessel, carrying
such a sensitive cargo, in such atrocious conditions was grossly
irresponsible and must not be allowed to happen again.
''I ask, therefore, that this incident is thoroughly investigated and
that you put in place a co-ordination with the relevant departments, new
procedures which will prevent repetition.
''I suggest that all such shipments from Dounreay, and I am told there
are three or four a year, be notified to HM Coastguard so that they can
offer advice on weather and sailing conditions. Indeed, that would be a
sensible precaution in the case of any sensitive cargo going through the
Minches.''
Mr Shepherd said, however: ''Dounreay has been involved in nuclear
transport for more than 30 years and in that time nothing has happened
to cause any danger to any member of the public. These transports are
controlled by international agreements which are carefully monitored.
''In addition, I would stress that there is no pressure of deadlines
for these cargoes so it is open to the master of the vessel to delay
departure or take whatever measures he believes necessary to ensure the
safety of his vessel. The coastguard are automatically informed of such
shipments.''

LABOUR has discussed the possibility with independent schools of local
authorities buying places in the fee-paying sector, Shadow Education
Secretary David Blunkett said yesterday.
However, he stressed these would not be for children selected for
academic ability but those with special needs and aptitudes, like music
and drama.
Labour remained committed to the abolition of the Assisted Places
Scheme, which subsidises places for the bright children of less well off
families, and plans to use the money to cut class sizes.
The disclosure came as leading independent heads urged the Government
to expand the Assisted Places Scheme.
Independent heads want the Government to act because they believe the
scheme -- which costs #110m -- could put ''clear blue water'' between it
and Labour at the next election.
Speaking in Dublin yesterday, they said they would talk to politicians
of any party about how to ensure wider access to their education.
The chairman of the headmasters' annual conference, Mr Hugh Wright,
told delegates the message to all parties was that they needed
independent schools.
To the Government, the message was that the Assisted Places Scheme was
good value.
To Labour, the message was that the independent sector was prepared to
talk about alternatives.
Labour has no plans to abolish fee-paying schools but is still
threatening their charitable status.
Mr Blunkett has said that will be reviewed, against the willingness of
independent schools to allow wider use of their facilities. Mr Wright
urged his members to do just that.
Mr Wright told journalists later that this idea had been discussed
with Labour.
''We are aware that the Assisted Places Scheme is under threat if
there is a change of Government,'' he said.
''We say to the Labour Party, if you take away the Assisted Places
Scheme, we would like to explore with you ways in which other bridges
could be built.''
However, Mr Blunkett poured cold water on hopes of an Assisted Places
Scheme by other means to benefit an academically selected minority of
children.
''We are not talking about reinventing the Assisted Places Scheme. We
are talking about providing opportunity for people who might be denied
it,'' he said.
Mr Blunkett said there was already scope for children with needs that
could not be met in the state sector to be provided for at fee-paying
schools.
''We are happy to continue to discuss ways in which the needs of
individual children can be met where there is not appropriate provision
in the state sector, for example children with special educational
needs, choir schools or ballet,'' he said.

TELEVISION's favourite church is facing a bill more than double that
first estimated to carry out essential repairs.
Luss Parish Church -- a regular backdrop for Scottish Television's
High Road soap and the scene of several showbusiness weddings -- needs
#560,000 for the work.
It was originally thought it would cost around #220,000 but further
inspections by surveyers have revealed the final cost will much greater.
The majority of the money is needed to replace a rotting wall plate --
the wooden framework that supports the 120-year-old roof. Rotting
plaster casts need to be renewed throughout the category-B listed
building and toilets installed.
Applications are being submitted to various funds and trusts including
Historic Scotland. Dumbarton Presbytery's buildings and missions
committee is examining the merits of the church's case before applying
to the Church of Scotland's general trustees.
A gala dinner with High Road actors has already been scheduled for
nearby Cameron House next month.
The Rev Ewen Nicol, minister at Arrochar and Luss, said he was still
optimistic about raising the money.
Local councillor Francis Meechan said it was not council policy to
intervene in such matters. He said: ''There are so many churches in need
of money in the area that we could not consider getting involved.

IT was a case of physician heal thyself when the laboratory housing
Strathclyde's regional chemist started producing acid rain.
The acid droplets fell on the cars of laboratory staff, seriously
damaging paintwork, to the extent that the council has had to stump up
#27,000 in compensation to car owners whose vehicles had either to be
resprayed or touched up.
However, a spokesman for the regional chemist emphasised that there
had been no threat to the health of laboratory staff or members of the
public in the surrounding residential area.
Faulty operation of three acid extraction units on the roof of the
laboratory block in Everard Drive, Colston, Glasgow, has been
established as the cause -- deeply embarrassing to a department whose
extensive remit includes the monitoring of atmospheric and environmental
pollution.
Councillors endorsed the #27,000 overspend in the regional chemist's
budget at a meeting of the general purposes committee after being told
that action had been taken to ensure the acid rain problem did not
recur.
Dr Charles McDonald, depute regional chemist and himself one of the
claimants, explained that the three acid scrubbing units, which extract
acid from laboratory fumes, had initially been operated without the
necessary running water.
But he emphasised that the department had no complaints against the
scrubbing units themselves. The fact was they were not operated as they
should have been.
Dr McDonald explained: ''Part of the problem is that this is the
biggest local authority laboratory in the United Kingdom.
''Prior to moving in here three years ago we were in smaller
laboratories where we knew how the building plant worked. When we moved
in here we were engineeringly ignorant.''

A 21-YEAR-OLD striker with St Mirren yesterday became the first
Scottish footballer to fail a drugs test since the SFA launched its
anti-drugs crusade in 1989.
The Paisley club confirmed that Barry Lavety, who has been capped for
Scotland at under-21 level, had been caught during a random drug test
operated by the club.
The club's management said Lavety, who had been left out of Saints'
side for the past three weeks, was now receiving treatment at a
rehabilitation hospital after testing positive for a ''social drug''.
Mr Jimmy Bone, manager of the first divison team, said: ''We are not
condoning, nor are we condemning, the boy. Our sole aim is to help him
and to see him return and lead a useful life. We don't want this to
undermine his whole future.''
The club's decision to hold its own drug tests was a direct result of
the way Mr Bone found foreign clubs had dealt with the problem.
He said: ''Because of my experience when I was managing in Africa, I
decided that this should be carried out here. This is the first time in
two-and-a-half years that anyone has been found to be positive.
''But I would emphasise that Barry, like all the players, has been
tested during that time without any hint of a problem. This is a one-off
incident but it was important that we acted quickly and got him all the
help he needed.''
The club's chief executive, Mr Bob Earlie, said: ''As part of the
club's policy, any player returning a positive test is required to
undertake further medical assessment to determine and ensure if the
result was an isolated occurrence.''
He added that Lavety, a local boy who joined Saints from Gleniffer
Thistle four years ago, was ''at present undergoing these assessments
and the club are awaiting the results of these procedures before
determining the extent of any action that may be considered
appropriate''.
Mr Jim Farry, SFA chief executive, said St Mirren had not brought the
matter to the SFA's attention. He said: ''It is a private
employer/employee matter and it is not part of the ongoing doping
control programme and was not an official test sanctioned by the SFA in
terms of our doping procedure.''
Mr Tony Higgins, secretary of the Professional Footballers'
Association, said: ''Drugs have never been a problem in Scotland but we
are conscious and accept that a lot of young players will come into
contact with social drugs and they have to be aware of the dangers.''
Mr Higgins said they were producing a video about the dangers of
drugs.
A police spokesman said last night: ''We have no involvement in this
case.''

CAMPAIGNERS yesterday criticised the Government for not devoting
enough money to fund a new scheme to encourage breast-feeding.
Breast-feeding among Scottish mothers is the second lowest in Europe
behind Eire, and well behind the rest of the UK. Latest figures indicate
it is declining further.
Surveys of maternity units show fewer than 30% of babies born last
winter were still being breast-fed at six weeks, a 2% fall since the
summer of 1994.
Announcing the new Scottish Breast-feeding Group with an annual budget
of #25,000, Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said: ''The
Government remains fully committed to the promotion of breast-feeding in
Scotland.''
However, Mrs Kathy McGlew, administrator for the National Childbirth
Trust in Edinburgh, said: ''It is ridiculous. Although I am pleased that
the group is being established, the funding is really a drop in the
ocean compared to what could be done with an intensive campaign.''
Mrs Frankie Taylor, an NCT counsellor, said: ''I think the group could
actually do with #250,000 rather than #25,000. Formula milk companies
spend #12m a year in the UK promoting their products.''
The new group takes over from the Scottish Joint Breast-feeding
Initiative, which has been running for the last four years. Its
co-ordinator, Mrs Jenny Warren, has been appointed national
breast-feeding adviser.

A BRITON arrested as he apparently headed for tonight's football match
between England and Norway is believed to have links with the far-right
group Combat 18, police said yesterday.
The man, along with eight other Britons and a Dane are being held by
police after they were taken from a Denmark train at Sarpsborg, Norway.
Combat 18 is believed to have organised much of the violence which
caused the abandonment of England's last away match -- against the
Republic of Ireland in Dublin in February.
Oslo assistant police chief Oeystein Berger said he expected one or
more of the group would be sent home.
This evening, the centre of Oslo was quiet with police in vans and on
horseback keeping a careful eye on the few England fans.
Mr Berger said another Briton, known to police for violence at
football matches, had been arrested and, along with two detained earlier
for allegedly stealing from a shop, this took the number in custody to
14.

A STUDENT running against Prince Edward in the election for Stirling
University's honorary president, yesterday said he feared for his
family's safety after being revealed as a ''tartan terrorist'' informer.
Last night, however, the man he helped convict, Mr Thomas Kelly,
claimed his fears were ''ridiculous''.
Mr Ben Goodwin, 36, a former member of the Scottish National
Liberation Army and Scottish Republican Socialist Party, befriended Mr
Kelly and informed Strathclyde Police about the groups' activities.
Mr Kelly was jailed for 10 years in 1984, for sending a letter bomb to
the then Trade and Industry Secretary Norman Tebbit.
Following the trial, Mr Goodwin, a father of six and former police
cadet and psychiatric nurse, received death threats and was moved to
London by the police to begin a new life.
He spent eight years there before returning to Scotland after his
marriage collapsed. He later remarried and lives in Tullibody,
Clackmannanshire. He is a third year sociology student at Stirling --
where he is campaigning on a Scottish nationalist platform and is the
prince's only challenger.
Mr Goodwin's past was revealed after extracts of the book Britain's
Secret War, detailing the Kelly trial, were circulated on campus.
He said: ''Now all this is out in the open again, there might be some
trouble. I'm not worried for myself, it's my family I'm worried about.
I'm big enough to look after myself and I know what to look out for, but
the kids don't.
''When I gave evidence, I stopped people being hurt or killed and
Tommy Kelly got 10 years. But I'm serving the life sentence.''
However, Mr Kelly, 40, now an SNP election agent in Glasgow, said: ''I
am not in the least bit interested in Bernard Goodwin. I don't want to
know about him. But I don't wish him any harm.
''I have never wished anyone any harm. What I did was so out of
character it is unreal. My conviction was the only time in my life that
I was even involved with the police.''
He said claims that Scottish terrorist groups were still pursuing Mr
Goodwin were ''ridiculous'', adding: ''I don't know anybody or any
organisation who would be interested in him.
''There never was an orchestrated terrorist campaign or an organised
group of people, just a few lumps of wood like me, who were daft enough
at the time to get caught up with the ideas of extremists.
''I hope nobody would use me as an excuse to do anything to the
bloke.''
Last night, Mr Goodwin said he had decided to make his concerns public
after he became aware of campus rumours surrounding his past.
He added: ''When I agreed to stand against Prince Edward, I rather
optimistically thought I could just sail through this without my past
coming up.''

TWO policewomen who admitted possessing and supplying drugs were
yesterday jailed for 12 months.
Constables Elizabeth Hartley and Lisa Wilkinson, both 25, bowed their
heads and fought back tears as Recorder of Liverpool Judge William
Wickham sent them to prison.
Passing sentence at Liverpool Crown Court, he said: ''Your counsel
submits that your occupation as police officers is not an aggravating
feature of the crimes to which you have pleaded guilty.
''The crimes themselves are no worse but police officers are trusted
by the community not to deliberately flout the law as you did,
deliberately taking prohibited drugs and, though this is not a case of
commercial supply, you deliberately supplied drugs to a girl you had met
on holiday.
''As police officers you knew, both of you, full well that what you
were doing was illegal, was wrong in every way, and potentially harmful
to your customer. These drugs are potentially harmful to those who take
them.''
The court heard how amphetamines, cannabis, and ecstasy were found in
the flat the two officers shared with John Roberts, 25, in Albert Road,
Colne, Lancashire.
Both women pleaded guilty to possessing cannabis, possessing
amphetamines, possessing the two drugs with intent to supply, and
supplying the two drugs.
Hartley also admitted possessing ecstasy. Wilkinson's plea of not
guilty to that charge was accepted by the Crown.
Roberts had admitted possessing and supplying Ecstasy at an earlier
hearing and was sentenced yesterday to 240 hours' community service.
Hartley's former boyfriend Andrew Howarth, 29, of Church Lane, Read,
Burnley, and Wilkinson's former boyfriend Jason Heath, 23, of Higham,
near Padiham, Burnley, were both jailed for three years on drugs
offences at an earlier hearing.
Two other men were fined for possessing cannabis.
Mr Guy Gozem, prosecuting, told the court that, in August 1994,
Lancashire police drug squad were observing a number of individuals
including Howarth and Heath.
Howarth was seen early on the evening of August 25 delivering
amphetamines and cannabis to the flat shared by the three.
Later that evening, he went back to the flat and posted seven tablets
of ecstasy through the letterbox. Roberts later took them away from the
premises.
Howarth was followed and arrested and police returned to the flat and
searched it.
They recovered 22 grammes of cannabis, worth #66, more than five
grammes of amphetamine, worth #50, and two ecstasy tablets, worth #10
each.
The majority of the drugs were found in Hartley's room, which was used
for visitors to the flat to congregate.
Lancashire Police announced in a statement late yesterday that both
officers had resigned from the force.

EXCLUSIVE
A 48-HOUR Cabinet fight over Home Secretary Michael Howard's
announcements tomorrow on law and order was resolved in Blackpool
yesterday. His original proposals for stiffer sentencing, parole, and
immigration control have been modified.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth is to issue a separate statement
tomorrow afternoon in Edinburgh on his proposals for the new session of
parliament next month. These have caused no problem with his Cabinet
colleagues.
However, at a meeting of the Cabinet's home affairs sub-committee in
Downing Street on Monday, several members remonstrated that Mr Howard's
planned announcements to the Tory conference tomorrow on the key issue
of law and order were going a bit too far.
Some of them said they felt they were being ''bounced'' into decisions
for the Blackpool conference which would make difficulties in all sorts
of other areas.
The prolonged meeting was heated as Mr Howard defended his conference
announcements, while his colleagues protested that they were being
consulted only at the eleventh hour.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, chairing the Monday meeting
in Mr Major's absence, took final decisions forward to another early
morning meeting at the Imperial Hotel in Blackpool yesterday.
By this time, the Prime Minister had been made aware of the
difficulties but his tendency was to back his Home Secretary in what he
considered to be a key policy area for the next General Election.
Yesterday, Mr Howard was persuaded to modify his announcements which
were designed to reassure the embattled Tories that the Government was
making a big swing in its legislation against the perpetrators of crime
and for the victims of crime.
New stringent measures to control immigration across the Channel from
Europe have also been slightly toned down and, with Mr Major's backing,
the main thrusts of the Home Secretary's speech to conference have been
agreed by his Cabinet colleagues. However, to achieve this there has
been considerable argument behind the scenes.
Tory chairman Brian Mawhinney, in his conference speech yesterday,
signalled that Mr Howard would be announcing new legal protections south
of the Border for those who have been prosecuted for defending
themselves or their property.
The Tories roared their approval at this prospect. Significantly, the
party chairman picked out the Home Secretary for praise from all his
Cabinet colleagues.
''Thank you Michael Howard for standing up to the liberal lobby, for
toughening our law and order system, and showing that we can turn the
tide of crime.''
Mr Howard had lost some of his arguments in the home affairs committee
meeting that morning in the Imperial Hotel.
However, a new problem arose for the Prime Minister yesterday when
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo used his conference speech to parade
his highly Euro-sceptic views. ''Brussels -- you knew I'd mention it,''
he said.
''The European Commission might want to harmonise uniforms and cap
badges or even to metricate them. The European Court would probably want
to stop our men fighting for more than 40 hours a week. They would send
half of them home on paternity leave.''
He went on: ''We will not allow Brussels to control our defence
policy. With a Conservative Government, Britain will not join a single
European army.''
Pro-European Tory MPs and members of the Strasbourg parliament were
outraged by what they saw as an attempt by the Defence Secretary to
curry favour with the Tory party in an irresponsible manner.

Post office move.
PLANS to house a new National Gallery of Scottish Art in Glasgow's
George Square post office building have been thrown into confusion,
following claims that the property is likely to be sold to a private
developer.
The news emerged last night after a meeting between Post Office
leaders and the heads of Glasgow District Council, Glasgow Development
Agency (GDA), and the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland.
Council chief executive Tom Monaghan, GDA chairman Michael Lunn, and
trustees chairman Angus Grossart said their understanding of the meeting
was the property would be sold to private developers for a speculative
commercial scheme. They could not provide any details of the developers
or the selling price.
However, the Royal Mail emphatically denied any decision had been made
and said a final decison may not be taken until the end of the week.
Mr Grossart said last night: ''It looks as though a decision has
probably been taken in London. It appears that a speculative commercial
offer is conditional on obtaining planning permission.
''But I would think it inconceivable that Glasgow (District Council)
would permit a commercial development on the post office building in
preference to the proposals we are putting forward, which would achieve
so much for Glasgow and Scotland.''
He said it was not certain if a final decison had been made but added
that was the understanding of the gallery supporters at the meeting.
He said it appeared the decision-making process was at an ''advanced
stage'', but added the door was open for Post Office leaders to change
their minds.
He said there were no contingency plans and the trustees were
committed to keeping the gallery in Glasgow.
Glasgow City Council leader Pat Lally said: ''I am very much angered
by this decision to sell to a private interest when there was clear
public support for the property to be used as the location for the
extension to the National Gallery.''
Mr Lunn said: ''We understand from information we have received that
the Post Office Board in London will consider offers for the George
Square building today.
''The GDA has sent a fax to the Chief Executive of the Post Office, Mr
Bill Cockburn, at his London offices requesting that, if our information
is correct, his board reconsider our offer and this public listed
building be made available to the trustees of the National Gallery for
this exciting and unique project for the art world.''
A Royal Mail spokeswoman said it was certain no decision had been made
and added that further talks were being sought with the GDA, the
council, and the trustees.
She added the decision would normally be taken at Scottish divisional
level and the evaluation process had not even been completed at that
level.
She said: ''My understanding is that we have received a number of bids
and we are still considering them.''
She confirmed that there had been a meeting yesterday, attended by
representatives from the Royal Mail, Royal Mail Property Holdings, and
the chairman of the Scottish Post Office board.

Strasbourg
The European Commission has decided to investigate unstable wartime
explosives being washed up on beaches in West and South-west Scotland.
The inquiry will also cover claims that radioactive nuclear waste was
dumped secretly in the area of Beaufort's Dyke and could now be leaking.
The investigation was announced by Mrs Ritt Bjerregaard, environmental
Commissioner in the European Parliament, after complaints made under
emergency procedures by Mr Alex Smith, Labour Euro-MP for South of
Scotland.
The legal base for the inquiry will be the Euratom Treaty which the
Commission is also invoking in its possible legal challenge to the
French Government's nuclear testing programme in the Pacific.
Mr Smith told the assembly that an ''environmental time bomb'' was
ticking away in the Irish Sea. He argued that, under Article 35 of the
treaty, EU member states had a duty continuously to monitor
radioactivity in the air, water, and soil.
''The Commission is entitled to take action to verify this monitoring
is being carried out properly,'' he said.
''It is incumbent on the Commission to come forward with some
proposals for urgent action before some child or other innocent person
is injured by these devices on our beaches.''
Mrs Bjerregaard responded that an inquiry would be made on the basis
of worries about radioactivity in the area.
Beaufort's Dyke, half a mile deep in the North Channel of the Irish
Sea, is Western Europe's biggest ammunition dump. After two world wars,
it is home to two million tonnes of mines, bombs, depth charges, shells,
and ammunition. In the past few weeks, many dangerous devices have been
washed up.
Labour's Mr Ken Collins, the Strathclyde East Euro-MP who is also
chairman of the Parliament's powerful environmental committee, told BBC
Radio Scotland last night: ''Fifty years ago, the dumping of these
munitions was thought to be safe -- but all this time later these things
are coming up to the shore. Once they are dumped down there, you cannot
control them.''
Mr Collins said lessons should be learned from this whole episode and
that the Government should mount its own investigation: ''If they cannot
reclaim these munitions and make them safe, what can they do to make
sure we don't suffer the consequences?
It would be quite terrible if British Gas, for example, had to stop
work there but it would be even more terrible if there was a serious
accident.''
British Gas has been laying pipe in the area.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, and his
Labour colleague, Mr Brian Wilson, MP for Cunninghame South, are seeking
a halt to all undersea operations in the area. They are seeking a
meeting with Defence Secretary Michael Portillo.

THE TSB formally agreed last night that it was prepared to be taken

The full details will be announced to the Stock Exchange as soon as it
opens this morning. Sir Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds, will
argue that the takeover is an essential move in the restructuring of the
financial services market in Britain.
Earlier this year, Sir Brian, who is generally regarded as the most
dynamic and far seeing of the banking community, warned that 75,000 jobs
would have to disappear in the banking industry over the next five
years.
Both Lloyds and the TSB have been shedding employees at a rate of
about 2000 annually from the respective branch networks.
TSB has around seven million customers in Scotland, the North of
England, and the Midlands, but with a fairly small representation in the
South of England which is the Lloyds bastion.
The two banks have some 3100 branches between them. That number will
drop by possibly 500 if the merger is completed and anything between
5000 and 10,000 jobs will be lost.
The TSB decision that it is prepared to be taken over will only
intensify speculation that other British retail banks such as the Royal
Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland will have their independence
severely threatened.

EUROPE faces trade wars, protectionism, deflation, and possibly
depression unless all EU member states move to a single currency
together, German President Roman Herzog warned yesterday.
He told Euro-MPs in Strasbourg: ''The days of the national economy are
long over.''
Germans afraid of losing their strong mark under economic and monetary
union had a point, he conceded, but he said its strength no longer
rested solely with the Bundesbank. It also depended on foreign markets
and the scale of EU economic integration.
It was no longer possible to define national economic interests
reliably, and the best monetary policy for the future of Europe as a
whole was via the single currency.
''If we don't follow this course together there will be competitive
devaluation of currencies, trade wars, protectionism, the
renationalisation of economic policy, and deflation -- if not
depression,'' said the president, adding: ''That would be a throwback to
the thirties.''
Mr Herzog also insisted that Britain had no need to be afraid of
federalism: ''I, naturally, support a political system that begins with
the letter F, but which of late has become taboo in European debate. I
still consider that system to be the best history has had to offer.
''Federalism -- there I've gone and said it -- is, after all, the
opposite of centralism. It can almost be said to be a method of
decentralisation. For this reason our Anglo Saxon Europeans need not be
afraid of it.''

A BOSNIA ceasefire will not take effect today as expected because of
Serb rejection, a senior UN official said.
''There is no ceasefire tonight,'' said Antonio Pedauye, head of the
UN Bosnia mission. The Bosnian Government said it was ready for a
ceasefire but the Serbs said they did not have the authority to accept
it, he added.
The Bosnian side proposed that the ceasefire should start one minute
after midnight on Wednesday but the Serbs said they did not have the
authority to accept that. They said they would inform Unprofor of their
decision by 7pm today, Padauye said.
The Bosnian Government had said earlier on Tuesday it was ready for a
ceasefire with the Serb as the blockade was lifted and gas and
electricity supplies flowed into Sarajevo.
The UN said it was satisfied utilities to the besieged Bosnian capital
had been restored. ''As far as we are concerned, the facilities are
restored. It is now up to the parties,'' said UN spokeswoman Major
Myriam Sochacki.
The ceasefire, a prelude to peace talks, which will start in the
United States on October 31, had already been delayed for 24 hours.
Bosnian Serbs had said they were also impatient to start the ceasefire
after heavy fighting in north and west Bosnia and a Nato air strike
against a Bosnian Serb army command bunker.
The ceasefire should have begun 24 hours earlier but was held up
because gas exports to Sarajevo from Russia had not resumed.
Fighting raged between government forces and the Serbs in northwestern
Bosnia on Monday as both sides tried to grab land before a ceasefire
freeze on frontlines was implemented.
* THE Government is to convene a peace implementation conference in
London before the Bosnian peace agreement is finally signed, Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind announced to the Conservative Party conference
yesterday.
He said it would bring together most of the nations which would be
helping Bosnia to rebuild.
He added: ''This will ensure that when the ink dries on the peace
treaty the peace implementation force, the reconstruction agencies, and
those who will supervise the elections can get on with their work
immediately.''

A COLLEGE in Lanarkshire which is to pay its principal #92,000 this
year, last night defended his salary in the wake of an anonymous
disclosure that he had been given a #38,000 rise.
The salary of Mr John Reid, principal of Bell College of Technology,
Hamilton, came under fire in a letter to the media stating: ''This rise
is totally insensitive considering college staff were offered
two-and-a-half per cent, then 5% with strings.''
A spokesman for the college confirmed that Mr Reid would be paid
#92,000 this year, compared with the #50,000 he earned last year,
excluding #4000 for pension rights.
However, explaining the real annual salary for Mr Reid was #68,000 a
year, not #92,000, he said: ''The payment shown for 1995 for Mr Reid
includes both back pay and a one-off payment made in respect of the
heavy workload involved in the transition of Bell College from the
jurisdiction of Strathclyde region to that of an autonomous college
between 1993 and 1994.
''The principal's salary and that of the vice-principal are set by the
remuneration committee of the board of management.''
The spokesman said Mr Reid's pay for this year was therefore made up
from a salary of #64,000, benefits of #4000, back-pay of #17,000, and
employer's pension contribution of #7000.
''Mr Reid's starting point for next year will be #68,000, or in that
region, not #92,000,'' he added.
Last night, Mr Reid said the letter had been sent by ''some anonymous
idiot''. He believed his real salary was moderate. ''There is nothing
extortionate in it,'' he added.
Bell College received #5.3m from Scottish Office funding this year --
about 65% of its operating costs. The remainder is made up from charges
for course fees.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman said the college was run by its own
board of management, despite being largely financed by Government money.

Fred said he would keep me in
the cellar . . . When they were finished with me they would bury me
under the paving stones of Gloucester. He said there were already
hundreds of people there
Caroline Owens
A WOMAN yesterday re-lived a 22-year-old nightmare during which she
was abducted by Rosemary and Frederick West, bound, gagged, and
physically and sexually tortured.
She was knocked unconscious during her ordeal and awoke to find her
hands tied behind her back with her own scarf and Fred West winding tape
all over her face -- over her eyes, her ears, and at the back of her
hair.
''I didn't think I was going home again,'' Mrs Caroline Owens told a
hushed Winchester Crown Court at the trial of Rosemary West, who pleads
not guilty to 10 counts of murder.
At the time of her ordeal, Mrs Owens was not quite 17.
As the attack on her began, she said she was in a state of terror and
panic. It was to last all night.
Mrs Owens, 39, who was dressed in a black suit with an open-necked
white blouse, gave her evidence in a confident voice.
She described how, as a 16-year-old, she regularly hitch-hiked between
her home at Cindiford and Tewkesbury to meet her boyfriend, Tony.
It was on one of these occasions that she was picked up by the Wests.
Amazingly, within a short time of offering her a lift, they suggested
to the young girl that shework with them as a nanny.
''I was a bit surprised,'' said Mrs Owens. ''I always wanted to be a
nanny but I said my parents would have to meet them first.''
The encounter which led to the job offer saw her move to 25 Cromwell
Street, Gloucester, as a child-minder on #3 a week.
She described how, on a couple of occasions when she was taking a
bath, Rosemary West would come into the bathroom.
She described other occasions when she and Rosemary West were alone.
''She would play with my hair saying -- 'Oh, you have lovely hair',''
said Mrs Owens.
She also told her how lovely she was.
''I was a bit embarrassed really, a bit uncomfortable.''
Fred was a bit of a braggart.
He said he could do operations on women and that he performed
operations, she told the jury of eight men and four women.
''When he was speaking about the operations, I thought he was just
showing off. I didn't think that he had done it.''
She stayed there for only five to six weeks before returning home. She
didn't like Fred and the parting was mutual.
Some weeks later, she was again hitching home from Tewkesbury when the
Wests pulled up and offered her a lift home. She accepted.
She sat in the back of the two-door Ford Popular car and Rosemary West
joined her, saying that she would like a chat.
The conversation began normally with the Wests saying how much they
missed her as did the children. However, as they passed through
Gloucester, the Wests starting speaking to her in a smutty manner.
''Fred asked if I had had sex with Tony that night,'' said Mrs Owens.
''I was embarrassed and said no.
''Rosemary had her arm around me and she started touching my breasts
over my clothes.''
The witness gesticulated to show how she tried to push Mrs West's arm
away.
It was, she said, at this stage that Fred asked what her breasts were
like.
Mrs West literally grabbed her and got hold of her. She was grinning
and laughing. ''It was not a nice laugh,'' said Mrs Owens.
''She was grabbing my chest and tried to grab me between my legs.
''I was struggling with her. It was getting a bit out of hand. I was
panicking. She was laughing.
''They were saying things to each other. It was just smutty talk about
me . . . about my body.''
She described how Mr West pulled the vehicle on to a grass verge near
the gate leading into a field.
Mrs West was still attempting to touch her.
Mr West turned round and started punching her around the head and
calling her names -- such things as ''bitch''.
Mrs Owens said that it was at this stage she was knocked out.
When she recovered consciousness, she found she was bound and gagged
by the tape -- it was brownish and very gummy, she said.
''Rose was holding me and Fred was putting tape around my face.''
Mrs West pushed her down on the back seat and sat on top of her as Mr
West drove towards Gloucester.
''They were talking and laughing,'' said Mrs Owens. ''She grabbed me
between the legs.''
When they arrived at 25 Cromwell Street, Mrs Owens said she was led
into the house by the arms.
''I was taken upstairs into the first-floor front room,'' she said.
There was a sofa and a double bed, a double mattress on the floor, she
told the court. It was opposite the room which she had previously
occupied when she was a nanny.
''I was still bound,'' she told the court. ''Fred told me to keep
quiet and said if I was good he would take the tape off.''
He sliced it with a knife but at the same time he cut her face. He
apologised.
She was made to sit on the sofa and Mrs West began to kiss her. At the
same time, she was touching her breasts over her clothes.
Despite her protestations, Mrs West continued the assault until she
left to make tea.
Mrs Owens described how she was then undressed by both Wests.
''They tied my hands back up again and gagged me with cotton wool,''
she said. ''They put me on this mattress or bed and blindfolded me.
''Mrs West got undressed. It was like being examined in the genital
area. Both of them were doing it.
Mrs Owens described how Rosemary West held her legs apart as her
husband beat her between the legs with a belt.
She said Mrs West performed oral sex on her with Mr West watching.
Eventually, he took his clothes off and went behind his wife and started
having sex with her at the same time. The witness's arms were still tied
behind her.
''I felt sick and scared. You can't believe this was happening,'' she
told the jury.
Mr West later had intercourse with her.
Both Wests then went to sleep. Mrs Owens described how she tried to
get to a window and open it. She could reach the window but not lift it.
In the early hours of the morning, at around 6am, there was a knock on
the door downstairs.
Mr West dressed and went to answer it. Mrs Owens said that she tried
to make a noise to attract the attention of the man whose voice she
could hear but Mrs West put a pillow over her head to stifle her.
Mrs Owens said her attempt to attract attention angered the couple.
''Fred said he would keep me in the cellar and let his black friends
use me. When they were finished with me, they would bury me under the
paving stones of Gloucester. He said there were already hundreds of
people there.''
She continued: ''I was scared to death. I just kept thinking about my
mum.''
Throughout her ordeal, she was offered more than one cup of tea and
was raped by Mr West. He apologised for hurting her.
''They asked me to go back and live with them,'' said Caroline. ''I
was amazed. I thought this would be my chance to get away from them. I
said: 'yes'.''
She insisted she would have to go home first to get her belongings.
Fred said that she was there for ''Rosie's pleasure''.
She was warned not to tell anyone of what had happened that evening.
She had two baths but still could not get the gum from the tape out of
her hair.
She helped dress the children before she and Rosemary West went to a
laundrette.
''Fred dropped us off,'' she said.
Mrs Owens continued: ''I was with Rose at the laundrette and I saw a
man. I just walked out. I just kept walking.
''I walked through Gloucester and met a friend's brother who gave me a
lift first to a friend's house and then to my home.''
The witness said she told her friend about the ordeal but no-one else.
''I was too ashamed,'' she said.
Eventually, her mother was informed and the police became involved --
although her stepfather didn't want them informed.
Mr Brian Leveson, QC, prosecuting, asked a final question of the day:
''Earlier this year, your mum unfortunately died?'' -- ''Yes.''
Although Mrs Owens had given her evidence in a confident manner, this
final question brought tears to her eyes as she left the witness box.
She will continue her evidence today.

<HEADLINE>Wife helped in hunt for virgins, neighbour tells court</HEADLINE>

ROSEMARY and Frederick West openly discussed how they went out
driving, hoping to pick up young virgins who were hitch-hiking,
Winchester Crown Court heard yesterday, writes James McKillop.
A former neighbour told the jury Fred West insisted it was better he
took Rosemary with him on these cruising journeys because she instilled
confidence.
''Fred said that having a woman in the car made it easier to pick up
young girls. They thought it was safe,'' said Mrs Elizabeth Agius, a
former neighbour of the Wests.
Mr West said that if the girls were aged between 15 and 17, they were
more likely to be virgins, she said.
''He could get more money if they were virgins. They had the
opportunity to go home with them and could go on the game if they wanted
to,'' said Mrs Agius, who now lives in Malta.
He preferred young runaways because they had nowhere to go, she told
the court.
The witness alleged the disclosures were made by Mr West in front of
his wife when they returned to their then-flat at 25 Midlands Road,
Gloucester, where she had been babysitting for them.
The events, she said, took place in 1971.
According to the witness, the couple travelled as far as London in the
search for young girls. However, according to Mr West, the best place to
pick up young girls was around Bristol, the witness said.
At the time, Mrs Agius was living next door to the Wests with her two
young children and her husband was working abroad.
According to the witness, Rosemary West once asked if ''I would do a
three-in-a-bed with her''.
She continued: ''She would have liked me to have gone to bed with them
but no way.''
Rosemary West was heavily pregnant at the time.
''She approached me a couple of times and asked if I wanted to go to
bed with Fred. He really wanted to go to bed with me,'' Mrs Agius said.
''I told her: 'If you want to keep my friendship, don't ever ask that
of me again'.''
At one time, Rosemary West had said she was a prostitute, Mrs Agius
said. ''Fred didn't seem to mind one bit,'' she said.
Indeed, he liked to listen and watch -- he wanted to know everything
Rosemary did. There was a hole in the wall through which he spied his
wife's activities. If he wasn't there, she would tell him exactly what
had happened.
Mrs Agius described how when her husband returned to the UK, she
invited the Wests to her flat to meet him.
It was not a success.
After her husband had put his arms around her, Fred West stood up and
stamped into the kitchen. A short time later, the Wests left.
Mrs Agius said she visited the Wests two days later to see if they
were all right.
''Fred said my husband should be six feet firmly under there. He
pointed to the floor,'' Mrs Agius said.
Frederick West would often attempt to persuade Mrs Agius into bed, the
witness said.
''He said he would tie me up and do all sorts of things to me,'' the
witness continued. ''If I wanted to, I could tie him up and do what I
wanted to.''
She insisted the subject did not progress beyond talk. She never had
sexual intercourse with Frederick West nor had she ever been involved in
a three-in-a bed session.
Later, when the Wests moved house, she paid a visit to 25 Cromwell
Street, where the remains of nine victims were later uncovered.
There she saw a cellar with a trap door. Mr West said it could be
turned into a playroom for the children. According to Mrs Agius, he then
added: ''Or I could make this my torture room.''
The remains of five young women were recovered from under the cellar,
the jury has been told.
''They were such a nice couple,'' said Mrs Agius. ''They were really
close.
''They were the type of people who did not hide anything from one
another.''
Under persistent cross-examination from Mr Richard Ferguson QC,
defending Mrs West, Mrs Agius emphatically denied that she had had
sexual intercourse with Mr West.
It was totally untrue to suggest that when Mrs West came home early
from hospital after giving birth to her daughter, May, she found her
husband in Mrs Agius's bedroom, she told the court.
She also denied that she had told a police officer that if she was
asked whether she had sexual intercourse with Mr West she would deny it
in court.
''I have never been to bed with Fred or had sexual intercourse with
him,'' she said. Nor had she had three-in-a-bed sex: ''I'm not that type
of person''.
After the witness left the box, Mr Leveson said the Crown would make
an admission and a document was handed to Mr Justice Mantell.
This concerned the alleged statement made to a police constable.
The judge wondered whether, when there was a conflict between two
witnesses called on behalf of the Crown, there should be an admission.
The judge suggested it should be a matter for the jury.
Mr Ferguson rose to his feet and said: ''If there is not going to be
an admission . . .''
The judge intervened and said if there was going to be a discussion it
should be carried out in the absence of the jury.
The jury were then asked to retire.
