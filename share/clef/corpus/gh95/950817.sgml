MR Bryan Gould, former member of the Shadow Cabinet, has denied he was
the author of a highly-critical article about Mr Tony Blair's
leadership.
Mr Gould, now vice-Chancellor of Waikato University in New Zealand,
said he was considering legal action and a protest to the Press
Complaints Commission over the feature in the London Evening Standard on
Monday.
The report took Mr Blair to task for giving up on socialist ideals,
and not having an ideology, seeking only to please the public.
Mr Gould protested: ''There is not a single word that I wrote. I did
write an article for them, which I faxed to them at their request. It
was a measured article and expresses a measured view about Tony Blair's
leadership and the troubles he is facing.''
He added: ''The article is a total fabrication, written by somebody
else.'' His article stated Mr ''Blair has had a brilliant first year''.
There was no comment last night from the Evening Standard about the
allegations.

TONY Blair's New Labour strategy came under fresh attack yesterday as
Tory Party chairman Brian Mawhinney took his campaign to expose ''loony
left'' councils to the north-east of England.
Dr Mawhinney used criticisms of Mr Blair's leadership style from
Labour MPs, councillors, and the unions in his latest onslaught at the
start of a two-day tour of Newcastle on Tyne.
Labour's strategy was ''starting to unravel'', he warned. ''The
violent language used against the Labour leadership from within the
party easily outguns anything that I have said about the Labour
leader.''
He added: ''We can examine what Labour do when they get power. Across
the country, as well as in the North-east, they present the public with
high council taxes, they pursue politically correct schemes, and they
build up high debt.''
He said Labour-controlled authorities in the North-east set some of
the highest council taxes in the country.
Labour's Shadow Environment Secretary, Mr Frank Dobson, defended the
councils' spending record, stating they ''have built houses, they have
built roads, they have built schools, they have built swimming pools,
they have built libraries -- all things that the people in the
North-east wanted.''

MANCHESTER United yesterday called off the #5m transfer of Andrei
Kanchelskis to Premiership rivals Everton.
Old Trafford chairman Martin Edwards issued a statement confirming the
on-going transfer wrangle between the two clubs had failed to be
resolved and Kanchelskis would stay registered as a United player.
The move broke down over demands from the Ukrainian winger's previous
club, Shakter Donetsk, for a #1.1m cut of the fee and United hoped the
huge stumbling block could be overcome.
But UEFA's refusal to extend the European Cup-winners' Cup
registration deadline in order to allow Kanchelskis to play in the
opening rounds of the competition further angered Everton.
Ironically, Kanchelskis is now registered with United for the opening
rounds of the UEFA Cup -- although his public bust-up with manager Alex
Ferguson would appear to have ruled out a return to the Red Devils'
line-up.
Everton refused to comment, although it is understood they may pursue
the possibility of legal action for an alleged breach of contract. The
club have already sold 21,000 season tickets and fans reacted with
disbelief to the news.

MOSES Kiptanui set one world record and lost another in a sensational
athletics grand prix last night in Zurich. The Swiss Weltklasse
(Worldclass) meeting lived up to its reputation as Kiptanui became the
first man to break eight minutes for the 3000 metres steeplechase, yet
was completely upstaged by Haile Gebreselassie.
The Ethiopian was timed at 12min 44.39sec, slicing almost 11 seconds
from the world 5000m record which Kiptanui had set only in June. To find
a comparable performance to Gebreselassie, you have to go back to 1932,
when Lauri Lehtinen reduced fellow Finn Paavo Nurmi's mark by 11.2
seconds.
The African pair, both world title winners in Gothenburg last week,
collected $50,000 and a one-kilo gold ingot each in addition to their
appearance fee, which was in excess of $50,000.
Kiptanui, just 22, but already three-times world steeplechase
champion, scorned pacemakers to clock 7-59.18, almost three seconds
inside his own previous mark. He now holds the four best times ever.
Linford Christie came back with a 100m victory in which he eclipsed
all three world championship medallists; Colin Jackson beat all three
hurdles medal-winners from Sweden; Michael Johnson extended his
five-year unbeaten run at 400m; and Noureddine Morceli ran the second
fastest mile ever.

THE news from Helsinki had been encouraging. Russia, who are clearly
warming to their task, had gone there last night and beat up on Finland.
Finally, the real powers of Group 8 were making their presence felt with
a stunning 6-0 win.
An hour or so later in Glasgow, with the evening sun spreading a
warming glow over Hampden, the supporters were in place and in the mood.
They were there, all 35,000 of them, to see Scotland enforce a claim to
a place in the European Championship finals, and all the team had to do
was follow Russia's lead and take care of Greece, another of the
pretenders.
It was something of a revenge mission since the Greeks were the only
side to have beaten Craig Brown's team in seven previous group matches.
Yet, a couple of game plans had been ruined by injuries to key
personnel, especially in defence, when first Colin Hendry and then Alan
McLaren were declared unfit.
The situation was so bad Tosh McKinlay had to be summoned only the
night before the game and told he would be making his international
debut, and a couple of days earlier, Ally McCoist was recalled even
though he hadn't played in the international arena for 28 months.
His last appearance for Scotland was in the 5-0 humiliation by
Portugal, a game in which he broke a leg.
The Rangers striker strolled out on to the Hampden surface before the
match and, looking up to the press box, spread his arms: ''Who would
have thought it, who would have thought I'd be back here after all this
time?'' he asked. ''But watch, just you watch me.''
We did, we did, and we saw, but we still don't believe what he did.
Neither do the Greeks, who must have thought McCoist was all washed up
and just making up the numbers. They should have had someone listening
to the striker because as time passed and Scotland struggled, miserably
at times, to break down the opposition's defensive forces, it began to
look like a job for someone special, a super-hero.
He didn't exactly slip into a phone box to change, but in 71 minutes,
Super Ally appeared.
A minute later he nodded his head and the ball was in Ilias
Atmatzidis's net. First touch on the leather orb. No problem.
The schoolchildren who were out in force at the national stadium had
cheered everytime McCoist had appeared out of the dugout to warm up, and
each time they were left subdued as he was recalled. With the ball in
the net, McCoist and his sixth form chums rejoiced in wonderful,
over-the-top style.
Our hero grinned that cheesy grin of his as though he had never been
away, and even though he will probably be 65 by the time the finals come
around next summer, who would dare bet against him not being part of the
show. Irrepressible. Put him in the SFA Hall of Fame now. We owe him.
Without McCoist's head Scotland would have had to settle for a draw,
and the game against Finland, also at Hampden, next month would have
been a greater problem. Now, joint top of the group on 17 points with
Russia, Brown's squad looks certain to qualify.
Greece, on 12 points from seven games, and Finland (15 from eight)
have still to play in Moscow and it would appear their challenges have
expired. Even a draw against the Finns would suffice since Scotland's
last group match is at home to San Marino, and 21 points look like being
enough.
Hopefully, by the time we get to England, flair will have been
re-introduced to the team which last night was devoid of creativity and
panache. McCoist's dramatic contribution deflected attention from the
unwelcome truth, which declared that Scotland were well short when it
came to intelligent play.
Of course Gary McAllister and John Collins were marked, but that's no
excuse. More was expected of them, although too often when they found
themselves clear of the midfield traffic -- Scotland, playing with three
men, Colin Calderwood, Tommy Boyd, and Stewart McKimmie, in defence, had
five in midfield -- they looked up and saw vast empty spaces before
them.
There was no cohesion, no link between midfield and forward line,
where Darren Jackson and Duncan Shearer were detached, and runs had to
be checked because there was no-one to whom the ball could be passed on.
It was all too frenetic and untidy as the Scots continued their dull and
lifeless treck towards the finals.
The Greeks, in fact, looked much more accomplished than us and created
better chances, some of which would have gone in had it not been for bad
luck and Jim Leighton having his head perfectly focused on his work. He
played a vital part in securing a win which was not thoroughly deserved.
The fans played their parts to the full also, and although they were
given effort in abundance, they would have preferred in return a touch
of subtlety at the sharp end. Their presence made the hairs on the backs
of necks bristle and one or two of the ancient tribal chants were
offered up.
''We hate Jimmy Hill, he's a poof,'' and ''Gerrintaerem.'' It was very
much like old times . . . until the game started and we discovered
creativity was absent. Ah well, you can't have everything.
The winners of the eight groups qualify along with the six
highest-placed runners-up, and the two remaining second-placed teams
play off for fifteenth place in England, with the hosts qualifying
automatically.

FERRARI yesterday confirmed they had persuaded defending world
champion Michael Schumacher to join them -- a salary believed to be in
the vicinity of #25m for two years might have helped him make up his
mind.
But the Italians will have to wait a while yet before they will know
for certain which of the other drivers will team up with the German, who
leads the current drivers' championship in his Bennetton Renault by 11
points from Damon Hill.
The Williams Renault driver yesterday pledged himself to the team for
another season after this one and he will be paid #6m.
Hill will be partnered next year by the 24-year-old French-Canadian
Jacques Villeneuve, who will replace David Coulthard. The Scot, who is
wanted by Ferrari and McLaren Merecedes, will not be rushed to make a
decision.
Doubts over Coulthard's continuation with Williams arose after
Villeneuve had tested sucessfully just before the British Grand Prix in
the middle of last month. Villeneve became the first Canadian to win the
Indianapolis 500 this year and Williams clearly see him as a better
prospect than Coulthard.
While disappointed to have lost Schumacher, Benetton announced
Ferrari's French driver, Jean Alesi, will drive for them for the next
two seasons.

Scotland 1, Greece 0
(Attendance -- 34,910)
SCOTLAND moved ever closer to a place in the European Championship
finals in England next summer with one of the most incredible goals
Hampden has celebrated.
There have been few occasions when the old Glasgow ground has welcomed
back one of its scoring heroes in such a dramatic fashion. It could, of
course, only happen to Ally McCoist.
He returned from the shadows of injury which have lasted more than two
years, moved from the substitutes' bench in 71 minutes, and scored the
goal which defeated Greece just a minute later with his first touch of
the match.
But even more amazing, McCoist scored with a header, a long, looping
header which dropped beyond the Greek keeper and just inside the far
post, sending the Rangers man cavorting towards the packed stands behind
the goal in delight.
McCoist had been drafted in on Sunday, one of the many replacements
manager Craig Brown had required to shore up what was eventually a
make-shift team. Then, just as he had done in a League Cup final against
Hibs, McCoist returned to the big time with a goal.
''I always felt that I could be back playing for Scotland, back
getting a goal,'' said the striker. ''The two-and-a-half years I spent
troubled with injuries have made things difficult. I'm not saying that I
knew it would happen, but I always felt that it was possible.
''Funnily enough, Jim Leighton, who was in goal for Hibs in that
League Cup final, was saying that he knew exactly how the Greek keeper
felt. But, tonight was not about just the goal, it was about the team
performance.
''I thought the team played really well. And I thought the fans were
tremendous. Now we have a great opportunity to reach the finals, and if
we do then that goal will rank as one of the best of my career.''
Brown had been forced to re-think his strategy, to re-jig his team,
because of the injuries which threatened to wreck all his dreams. But
McCoist, the old dream maker, arrived to rescue things.
''It is always good to have someone such as McCoist on the bench,''
said manager Brown. ''This was a fairytale for him. He lifted the crowd
when he came on, and he gave us the goal, and that may be enough to take
us to England next summer.''
Brown, and his players, had been lifted by the news before the match
that Russia had defeated Finland 6-0. ''It may be that all we need
against Finland is a draw,'' he added, ''but we will still look for
victory next month.''
The Greek manager, Costas Polychrinou, thought that Scotland had been
fortunate. He knew, however, that his country's chances now had slipped
away and shrugged: ''We must now start to prepare for the World Cup
qualification. This is now over.''
The Scots had seen Leighton make a superb save to thwart the Greeks in
the second half before McCoist struck.
Brown, however, remained happy with the display from a team which had
been put together as time ran out on him before the match.
A squad of honest tradesmen, leavened by some special skills, and by
the stardust of that man McCoist, who has now taken Scotland to the
brink of the matches they so want to take part in next summer.
Brown drafted in Celtic's Tosh McKinlay at the last moment to play at
left back, allowing his team-mate Tom Boyd to go to the central
defensive area he has occupied with his club so far this season.
The Scots moved forward as Brown had hoped at the beginning of the
game, and in the opening minutes, Stuart McCall tried a long-range shot
which went off target, and then John Collins attempted something similar
only to see his effort held by the Greek keeper.
In eight minutes Craig Burley was booked for a wild tackle on
Kassapis. Burley had been fouled moments earlier, but his retaliation
was against the wrong man, at the wrong time, and in the wrong manner,
and he deserved his yellow card.
The Greeks looked menacing when Boyd seemed to miss the ball in the
evening sun and it broke for Tsartas. Only a late challenge from Burley
made the Greek forward mistime his shot, and Leighton was not troubled.
Minutes later McKinlay crossed from the left, and while Shearer missed
the ball, Burley came in behind him only to see his header go wide. The
Scots had the large crowd behind them, and they tried to maintain the
tempo Brown had demanded.
After 71 minutes the manager replaced Darren Jackson and Duncan
Shearer with John Robertson and McCoist, and within a minute the move
had paid off in remarkable style with the winning goal.
SCOTLAND -- Leighton (Hibernian), McKimmie (Aberdeen), Boyd (Celtic),
McCall (Rangers), Calderwood (Tottenham Hotspur), T McKinlay (Celtic),
Shearer (Aberdeen), Burley (Chelsea), Jackson (Hibernian), McAllister
(Leeds United), Collins (Celtic). Substitutes -- Walker (Partick
Thistle), Martin (Motherwell), B McKinlay (Dundee United), Robertson
(Hearts), McCoist (Rangers).
GREECE -- Atmatzidis, Apostolakis, Karataidis, Kalitzakis, Dabizas,
Tsalouchidis, Zagorakis, Batista, Vryzas, Tsartas, Kassapis. Substitutes
-- Vlachos, Georgiadis, Alexandris, Michopoulos, Machlas.
Referee -- P Mikkelsen (Denmark).

THE perils of being race leader in light breezes hit home for
Glendronach, the Scottish boat which headed the Round Britain Challenge
fleet of 10 boats.
Glendronach, skippered by Oban's John Fitzgerald, had a lead of
approximately a mile in fickle winds yesterday morning. They were
further inshore when the wind died and first so be held by the changing
tide off Selsey Bill. The chasing pack saw leader Fitzgerald's
predicament. Making nothing against the new tide he was forced to drop
anchor in an attempt to remain stationary. The chasing five boats saw
more breeze offshore and, circling outside Glendronach, left them in
sixth place.
With light winds forecast to continue for at least a further two days
and the fleet less than a third of the way after three days of this
450-mile first leg from Southend to Cardiff, the organisers are believed
to be contemplating shortening the course.

NOT for the first time, and almost certainly not the last, Scotland's
younger generation of footballers seem hell-bent on proving there is
life left in the old country yet.
The way they played against Greece in the Under-21 match at Rugby Park
on Tuesday, there is every chance that the clean-faced lot will have us
all trying to solve the perennial question: what happens to Scottish
players when they grow up?
The quality of play was genuinely high, the commitment complete and
the selflessness admirable. The team now has a great chance to go into
the quarter-finals of the European Championship and, after a run of five
successive victories in their group, they ought to be favourites to make
it.
While coach Tommy Craig was anxious to put the credit where it is due,
the fact is that he has to be given some plaudits himself, if only for
gathering together some promising talent and honing them into a willing
and organised unit.
Craig believes that he has a choice of close to 40 players who each
could fit in with the system now operating at this level, and if he is
right, there is a lot more going for the Scottish game than many of us
had thought.
Even if that is a touch hyperbolic, the skill factor in the team that
beat Greece 3-0 was a welcome sight for Scottish eyes. In players like
Neil McCann, Charlie Miller, Andy Liddell and Stephen Glass, Craig has
tremendous potential, and there were others not far behind.
The manager wished to highlight the central defender and captain,
Steven Pressley, who has helped form the base which Craig claims has
been the foundation for the team's success and, while that may be
justified, it was perhaps not the ideal moment. The Dundee United
defender was booked late in the game and as a result is out of the
crucial meeting with Finland at Broadwood Park next month.
Pressley was honest enough to admit that his tackle had been ''a bit
silly'', especially when his team were three up and heading for a
comfortable win.
''I am really disappointed about missing that game,'' he said. ''I
pleaded with the ref as soon as it happened, because I knew what it
meant. Playing for this team means a lot to me.''
Pressley, who had a less than spectacular spell with Coventry after
leaving Rangers for #600,000 last October, confesses he is enjoying his
football again at Tannadice.
''There was a spell when I was not enjoying it and it is difficult to
do your best when you feel like that.
''I made a few costly errors at Coventry, but I hope the experience of
playing in the Premiership will help me. I have not proved anything in
my career yet and I have a lot to do.''
For Celtic's Simon Donnelly, who came on in the second half, the goal
he scored broke a long, unprofitable run in that department, although
his blank card last season might have had something to do with the
injuries which kept him out of action for long spells.
''It sure was good to score again,'' he said, ''and it was a great
cross from Stuart Gray. It was a treat to watch this team from the bench
in the first half.''
It was pretty good from where we were sitting, too.

THE dream move that took John Hughes from Falkirk to Celtic last week
looks like requiring the transfer tribunal to settle a fee.
Celtic manager Tommy Burns signed Hughes 10 days ago under freedom of
contract and there was confidence then that a financial agreement would
be reached.
However, Falkirk chairman George Fulston has had subsequent talks at
Celtic Park and the clubs remain a distance apart in their valuations.
Celtic are willing to pay around #250,000 for the centre-back, but
Fulston is looking for closer to #1m for his 30-year-old former skipper.
Meanwhile, Jim Bett and Scott Crabbe will swop clubs this week if
former Scotland midfielder Bett can agree terms with Dundee United.
New Hearts manager Jim Jefferies wants to bring 27-year-old striker
Crabbe back to Tynecastle, but has no budget for new players, while Bett
wants a club closer to his Aberdeen base.
Eamonn Bannon's hopes of facing Hibs for Stenhousemuir in Saturday's
Coca-Cola Cup second round have been dashed by a damaged hamstring.
The recently sacked Hearts assistant manager turned out for
Stenhousemuir in Saturday's 2-2 draw at Queen of the South, but now the
injury has robbed him of the chance of playing again at Easter Road,
where he was a coach until last summer.

PAUL Weir, the WBO light-flyweight champion of the world, is seldom
surprised by anything the boxing world throws at him, but yesterday he
did admit to being mildly shocked when manager Tommy Gilmour announced
his plans for the coming season.
It was widely believed, even by the champion himself, that his next
defence of the title would be against 'Baby' Jake Matlala in Sun City,
South Africa, but Gilmour is now fairly confident that the bout will
take place in Scotland.
Said Gilmour: ''I will announce a date and a venue for the Matlala
fight within the next fortnight, but there is now a good possibility
that it will go ahead in Scotland.
''I have a meeting with a major sponsor lined up for 10 days' time,
and if it is a successful one, Paul won't have to travel.
''We really shouldn't need to leave Scotland, because Paul is the
champion, but the money on offer to fight in South Africa was too much
to turn down. Now, however, everything could change.
''Matlala took the world title from our own Pat Clinton and he is the
genuine article. If Paul doesn't show on the night, Jake could do the
same to him as he did to Clinton.''
Weir, who will earn well into a six-figure sum for the defence, said:
''To fight in Scotland would be a bonus. I've always said I'm happier
performing in front of my own fans.''

WELSH football chiefs meet today in a bid to end their seven week
search for a successor to the sacked Mike Smith, with Brian Flynn and
Mike Walker the two favourites for the role.
Coventry manager Ron Atkinson was on a seven-name shortlist, as was
one of his predecessors at Highfield Road, Bobby Gould, along with two
former Everton managers, Walker and Howard Kendall.
Everton goalkeeper Neville Southall was also included, with Wrexham
manager Flynn, currently in charge of the Under-21 side, and the FAW's
development officer Jimmy Shoulder.
Walker's place of birth -- Colwyn Bay -- has helped his cause with
those keen for a Welshman to be in charge of the national side.
But Flynn, the midfield dynamo who played 66 times for Wales, has a
very strong lobby in his favour.

* RANGERS' European tie next Wednesday has meant a major rethink over
the date for games in the Scottish Football League Challenge Cup. With
the likelihood of the Ibrox side being live on television, the
Lanarkshire derby between Hamilton and Airdrie yesterday became the
latest to be switched to next Tuesday.
The only matches now being played on the Wednesday are Stranraer v
Dundee United, which will kick off at 6.30, and Livingston v Morton. The
Albion Rovers v Ross County tie will be played this Saturday.

ALTHOUGH Scotland were beaten 4-1 by Holland, beaten finalists in last
year's World Cup, in the opening round of matches in the Nissan European
Nations Men's Hockey Cup in Dublin last night, they came out of the
contest with their image very much enhanced.
They opened the scoring in seven minutes through their captain Duncan
Low at their second penalty corner.
But by the break, the sides were level after Marc Delissen had forced
the equaliser with a brilliant reversed stick shot.
Scottish defender David Leiper took a knock three minutes after the
break and while he was off the pitch receiving treatment Erik Jazet gave
Holland the lead and then five minutes later Stephan Veen hit their
third.
The Dutch added another goal 10 minutes from time, again through Veen.
On the evidence of this display, Scotland have grounds for optimism in
forthcoming games, for Belgium, despite beating Wales 3-1, were not
over-impressive, while France looked very average when going down to
Spain by a similar score.

MONICA Seles powered into the quarter-finals of the Canadian Open last
night with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over France's Nathalie Tauziat.
Seles, playing her first tournament since she was stabbed on court in
Hamburg in 1993, needed just 56 minutes to defeat the world No.17.
The former Yugoslav, who now plays under the US banner, elevated her
game against Tauziat after showing signs of rust in her opening-round
victory over American Kimberly Po. Several times Tauziat was left
stranded in the middle of the court as Seles rocketed winners past her.
Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, meanwhile, breezed past Lea
Ghirardi-Rubbi of France 6-1, 6-2 in her opening match.
Elsewhere Helena Sukova of the Czech Republic beat Japan's Kyoko
Nagatsuka 0-6, 6-0, 6-4, while Swiss prodigy Martina Hingis ousted
Argentina's Florencia Labat 6-1, 6-2.
After her victory over Po, Seles said: ''For a long time everything
was dark. Now I see the sun again.''

LINFORD Christie, who 11 days ago surrendered his world 100 metres
title and had to be helped from the Gothenburg track with a thigh
injury, having finished sixth, staged a miraculous return in Zurich last
night with victory over five world finallists, and all three men who
took medals ahead of him in Sweden.
His success keeps him on target for 20 kilos of gold. He now must win
in Brussels and Berlin.
The 35-year-old Christie clocked 10.03, his fastest time of the year,
with the world champion, Canadian Donovan Bailey second (10.09) and
American John Drummond third (10.10). He also left world runner-up,
Bruny Surin of Canada, floundering in eighth, with Trinidad's bronze
medallist, Ato Boldon, fifth.
''I've been through hell trying to get my mind and body together''
said Christie. ''I'm on painkillers and I think I'm coming to the end of
the road at the right time. The doctor has told me to expect it to be
sore for as long as I run. But as long as the leg doesn't fall off, I'll
be okay!
''I didn't have to compete here. I was getting paid whether I ran or
not. There was no pressure. I ran because I wanted to. Winning is always
good, but it's come a week too late. At the end of the day, Donovan
Bailey is the world champion. I have to pick up the consolations as I go
along.''
Christie will see if there is any reaction before deciding whether to
run for Britain against the USA on Monday.
Hurdler Colin Jackson, too badly injured to race in Gothenburg, staged
a similar recovery, and also beat all the world medallists. But the
Welshman did not win. Mark Crear, who failed to make the US team for
Sweden, came home in 13.18, three hundredths clear of Jackson with world
champion Allen Johnson third and double Olympic champion Roger Kingdom
fifth. England's Tony Jarrett, runner-up to Johnson in Sweden, was
fifth.
But the night belonged to the endurance men, both of whom retained
their world titles last week.
Haile Gebreselassie's 5000m was one of the most remarkable
record-breaking runs ever. His time, 12min 44.39sec, is the equivalent
of running inside 4min 05sec for three successive miles, then holding on
at the same speed for a further half lap.
Moses Kiptanui, who trains in Teddington, scorned a pacemaker to slice
almost three seconds from his own three-year-old mark, with 7-59.18.
Yvonne Murray's nightmare continued when she could finish only
thirteenth in the 3000 metres, which was won by world 5000m champion,
Sonia O'Sullivan in 8-27.57, the fastest time in the world this year.
Marie Mutola, disqaulified in Sweden, beat 800m winner Anna Quirot,
and Gwen Torrence, the American denied 200m gold for running out of her
lane, enjoyed revenge over Jamaica's Merlene Ottey who accused her of
cheating.
Ashia Hansen broke the UK and Commonwealth record in the women's
triple jump, with 14.38. Winners and UK placings:

BRIAN Laudrup could be out of Rangers' squad for next week's European
Cup tie in Cyprus.
The Great Dane was pulled out of yesterday's European Championship
Group 2 match in Armenia because of an ankle injury. Laudrup suffered
suspected ligament damage in training with the Danish squad earlier this
week.
He said: ''An X-ray showed the ligament was intact. But it was sore
after the accident and I could feel it when I walked.''
The Danes treated his injury with ice packs but last night they had to
give up and he had to sit out as his compatriots beat Armenia 2-0 --
with his brother, Michael, opening the scoring in 33 minutes with a
header.
A spectacular, long-range goal from debutant Allan Nielsen within
seconds of coming on as substitute lifted Denmark to a 2-0 win and
second place, three points ahead of Belgium, but five behind runaway
leaders Spain.

* TWO goals apiece from Vassili Koulkov and Igor Kolyvanov helped
Russia trounce Finland 6-0 in a Group 8 European championship qualifying
match in Helsinki last night.
Russia's patient build-ups and accurate passing gave the Finnish
defence problems from the start, but the visitors had to wait 33 minutes
for their opening goal. Striker Kolyvanov, who plays for Foggia in
Italy, beat two defenders before playing the ball to Spartak Moscow
midfielder Koulkov to score from close range.
Another midfield player, Valeri Karpine, scored the second in 40
minutes with a shot from outside the penalty area. And three minutes
later striker Dmitri Radchenko put his side three ahead when he punished
poor defensive play by the Finns.
Koulkov's second goal, a powerful long-range shot from another
Kolyvanov pass, came four minutes into the second half. Kolyanov made it
five in 67 minutes and added another two minutes later as he glanced in
a header.
* A GOAL three minutes from full time gave Latvia a surprise 3-2
victory over Austria in Riga and eased pressure on Jack Charlton's
Republic of Ireland side in Group 6. Portugal head the table on 18
points, four ahead of the Republic, with Austria on 12, and Northern
Ireland on 10.
* A LATE equaliser by Jan Suchoparek salvaged a 1-1 draw for the Czech
Republic against Norway in Oslo. Blackburn Rovers full back Henning Berg
had given the Group 5 leaders the lead in 27 minutes.
Norway, on 20 points, remain eight points clear of the Czechs, with
Holland a further point behind.
* A GOAL early in the second half by Darius Maciulevicius gave
Lithuania a narrow 1-0 victory over Group 4 minnows Estonia in Tallinn,
and kept the pressure on both Italy and Croatia.
YOURI Djorkaeff's equaliser four minutes from time kept France in a
challenging position in Group 1, as they drew 1-1 with Poland in Paris.
The Poles, who opened the scoring through Andrzej Juskowiak in the first
half, are level with France on 11 points, six behind leaders Romania.

NOW with a legitimate claim to being Ayrshire's fastest-growing retail
car dealership, Robert Wyper has come a long way in just six years.
The original venture was based on the selling of used cars in
Kilmarnock. This proved to be an immediate success, leading the first
franchise acquisition, in January 1991.
It was then that Wyper's took on a SEAT franchise. The Spanish company
by then was in the hands of Volkswagen and it was apparent that its
budget-priced range, heavily bolstered by German technology and quality
control levels, was set for a period of sustained growth.
Again sales confirmed the company had made the right move at the right
time, but later that year an even bigger prize was landed, when a
Peugeot franchise was secured. For the first time Wyper was operating in
the large volume mainstream of the market and one of the inevitable
results was pressure of space.
This was to be increased dramatically when another important
franchise, Renault, was taken on. Hence the decision to commission a
purpose-built, twin-showroom complex in Ayr's Heathfield Road. Work
started in October 1994 with Barr Construction in charge of the project.
It was completed just six months later.
SEAT and Renault products are housed here, both showrooms being large
enough to accommodate the entire ranges from both manufacturers, with
separate parts and service departments for each marque.
Robert Wyper is especially delighted with the reception given to the
1995 Renault range by his customers. Starting from scratch, the
dealership has attracted both existing Renault owners as well as many
who are taking delivery of the French cars for the first time.
As one of the most technically advanced ranges of cars available,
Renault is viewed by Wyper as a viable alternative to the ''big three''
of Rover, Ford, and Vauxhall in the fleet market and business sales are
being pursued aggressively.
With the service areas already providing Class 5 and 7 MOT facilities,
light commercials can also be handled -- and there are plans in the
pipeline to extend the service side of the business still further.
Although comprehensive stocks of parts are kept for each marque, the
manufacturers can and do provide overnight deliveries of those ''hard to
find'' items.
''As far as customer service goes, our aim is simply to do it better
than anyone else,'' said Caroline Glen. ''We are very aware of the fact
that we are operating in an area where any lapse of standards would soon
become public knowledge -- so it simply will not happen. We take pride
in the fact that we have built up a solid core of loyal customers who
keep returning to us for all their motoring requirements.''
Robert Wyper Motors currently employs more than 100 people at its four
dealerships and there are plans for further expansion when opportunities
are identified.

ONE of the first members of the Institution of Planning Supervisors
was Glasgow-based quantity surveyor Bruce Holmes. He completed the CDM
course in May, and his partnership, Wilkinson and Lowe, currently has 14
planning supervisor commissions. They include local authority housing
repairs, a factory upgrade, a new business centre, a church hall, a
couple of residential care units and demolition work on a retail park.
''I regard training in the CDM Regulations as an essential tool for
the developing surveyor,'' says Bruce Holmes. ''We are building
professionals first and foremost, and this is a skill which we feel we
want to provide.
''CDM moves health and safety a couple of pegs up the priority ladder.
It is predominantly an administration role, requiring a broad background
in the profession. The quantity surveyor is ideal as planning supervisor
because he is not blinkered, and looks at the structural, architectural
and services sides of the project.''
The planning supervisor is responsible for seeing that the Health and
Safety Plan is available for contractors tendering to carry out or
manage construction work. He also has to ensure that the Health and
Safety File is prepared as the project progresses and is given to the
client when the project is complete. This file tells anyone who might be
responsible for the structure the risks that have to be managed.
Wilkinson and Lowe, with offices at Charing Cross, have been chartered
surveyors for 50 years. Partner Ian Stanners, who is chairman of the
Scottish Building Contracts Committee, has been one of the lecturers on
the CDM course.
The five day-long sessions cover the legal framework of CDM,
construction safety, new responsibilities under CDM, hazard and risk
management, and the planning supervisor's role. An advanced tutorial on
the sixth day completes the course.

James Currie reports from an Ayrshire company which has recently been
voted the best in its field.
ASK any successful motor trader to explain how they manage to prosper
when all the available economic indicators are anything but optimistic
and you will need a sharp pencil.
But three essentials will invariably emerge: choice, presentation,
quality of staff and service -- and a healthy stock of good quality used
cars.
In an increasingly sophisticated market, motorists can, and do, shop
around. Alternatives abound. You may have set your heart on a particular
make and model of car -- but what if someone offers you another vehicle,
similarly specified, at a lower price? You will certainly think about
it. Indeed it would be unwise not to, but at this point other factors
enter the equation and in the end you will look closely, not just at the
bottom line, but at the credentials of the vendor.
Facilities, backup, staff attitudes and reputation. Ignore these at
your peril. A new or used car represents a considerable capital
investment and its purchase should be considered as carefully as, say, a
new house. After all, many of us are now spending more on a new car than
the original purchase price of the homes we live in.
It isn't always an easy task, but Ayrshire motorists have just been
given another valuable pointer, this time from the motor industry
itself.
Robert Wyper (Motors) Limited, who operate four major franchises in
the area, two each in Ayr and Kilmarnock, has been named National Used
Car Retailer of the Year at the annual Motor Industry Awards, held
recently in London's Grosvenor House Hotel.
The prestigious award came after a lengthy period of scrutiny by the
judges, who had to examine the credentials of hundreds of competing
companies spread throughout the UK.
The pressure mounted when it became clear the company had made a
national short list of four. Then came the final announcement and the
celebrations could get under way.
Robert Wyper scored particularly highly in a number of key areas, one
of which was premises. Wyper has four dealerships, furnished to a very
high standard, and all featuring an extensive, modern showroom capable
of showing the company's various product ranges to their best advantage.
Added to this were full on-site parts and service departments, again
fully stocked and equipped with the array of modern diagnostic equipment
vital to any service and repair facility.
But the clincher was probably the sheer volume of cars on display.
Every conceivable popular make and model, all presented to a uniformly
high standard and priced to suit every pocket, from the younger
first-time buyer to the mature motorist seeking a high value product.
Robert Wyper cut his business teeth in the used car trade and is
justifiably proud of his ability to provide something for every
requirement.
''When customers have seen the choice of vehicles we have for sale,
they realise there is no need for them to go anywhere else,'' he said.
But although the product range was important, Mr Wyper insists the
judges were impressed by other factors, including the overall quality of
the cars on display and the fact that each was individually presented
and in clean condition.
As for staff, customers can expect a personal welcome on entering the
dealerships, one which is professional and courteous rather than forced
or over familiar.
It is an old but true motor trade adage that you can sell anyone a car
once. The real secret of successful trading is to establish a large
customer base from which you can expect a high percentage of repeat
business.
Recognising the role to be played here by after-sales service, Robert
Wyper insists: ''I like to think I can reward the loyalty of my
customers by providing them with the level of after-sales service that
really does inspire 'peace of mind' ownership.''
To scoop the National Used Car Retailer of the Year award after a
comparatively short period of trading is remarkable by any standard and
one of which Robert Wyper is justifiably proud.
He sees its acquisition as a nod of approval towards the entire
Ayrshire motor trade as much as a personal achievement. Declaring
himself ''absolutely thrilled'', he concluded: ''I feel the award
recognises the very high standards we have set here and the trophy is
something of which we can all be very proud.''
Given the intense level of competition within the industry -- and the
plethora of dealerships operating to standards practically unknown even
a decade ago -- the fact that it was a Scottish-owned and operated
company which emerged with the ''best in Britain'' tag is extremely
heartening.

THE deaths this year of three men in a horrific accident on a Dundee
building site, followed by the tragedy of four deaths on a site in
Ashford, Kent, are among the latest statistics in the grim health and
safety record of the construction industry -- and for every death
reported there are thousands of injuries.
A welcome bid by the Health and Safety Executive to improve this
appalling record has brought new regulations on Construction Design and
Management (CDM), which came into effect earlier this year.
In a trailblazing initiative, the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors in Scotland has set up a joint scheme which, for the first
time in the United Kingdom, provides specialist training for chartered
surveyors in the vital role of planning supervisor.
The CDM Regulations reallocate the responsibilities for health and
safety during a building project's design and construction phase, and
throughout the maintenance, alteration and even demolition of the
building. They place new duties on designers and contractors and, in
particular on clients and their planning supervisors.
Only very minor construction work on occupied premises, and most work
carried out for householders on residential property are outwith the
scope of CDM Regulations.
Overall responsibility for co-ordinating the health and safety aspects
of the project falls on the planning supervisors, but the Regulations
make it clear that:
''No client shall appoint any person as planning supervisor in respect
of a project unless the client is reasonably satisfied that the person
he intends to appoint has the competence to perform the functions of
planning supervisor under these Regulations in respect of that
project.''
In recognition of the importance of CDM, the RICS in Scotland launched
a joint initiative with the internationally renowned safety organisation
C-MIST (Centre for Maritime and Industrial Safety Technology) to provide
specialist planning courses and to set up the Institution for Planning
Supervisors (IPS).
Now, more than 100 Scottish chartered surveyors have completed the
course at the Heriot-Watt Research Park, Edinburgh, and passed the
searching assessment to enable them to become members of the IPS.
The joint initiative was launched by Eileen Masterman, director of the
RICS in Scotland, and Mehdi Laftavi, managing director of C-MIST, and
the courses were set up by Mary Fyfe, assistant director (conferences)
at the RICS in Edinburgh. Eileen Masterman said: ''I welcome the fact
that our members are receiving intensive, practical training to enable
them to develop in the crucial role of planning supervisor.
''We have chosen C-MIST as our partner in this project because it has
an excellent track record in providing courses on health and safety
services world-wide.
''Though primarily for members of the surveying profession, the CDM
course is also relevant to the needs of other construction
professionals.
''We have been encouraged by a growing interest in the programme from
chartered surveyors south of the Border and courses will be extended
throughout the UK in due course.''

THE Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland represents
some 6000 members working in six property markets -- commercial,
construction, infrastructure, minerals, residential and rural -- and
operating in six areas.
The strategy of the RICS in Scotland is authorised by a Scottish
Council, with the chairman's committee ensuring the effective day-to-day
running of the institution's affairs, and area committees providing a
link between the RICS's Scottish headquarters at Manor Place, Edinburgh,
and the wider membership.
The RICS is increasingly a graduate profession, and courses offering
exemption, or partial exemption, from the institution's examinations may
be taken at a number of Scottish universities and colleges.
Current chairman of the RICS in Scotland is Ian Murning, and the
secretariat in Edinburgh is headed by the Scottish director, Eileen
Masterman and a staff of 17.

SUN LIFE Assurance has leased space in Dunedin Property's Q Court
development (above) on Edinburgh's Quality Street. It has taken 900
sq.ft plus car parking at an initial rental of #14,368 a year, with a
rent-free period.
Scott Gibson of Dunedin says: ''Sun Life's move reflects the quality
of finishes and flexibility of space offered by Q Court and adds to the
already impressive list of tenants -- such as Bryant Homes, Reuters TV,
and Bovis Construction.''
Only one building (extending to 4,120 sq.ft plus car parking) remains
within the development. Dunedin Property was jointly represented by
Chesterton, Jones Lang Wootton and DTZ Debenham Thorpe, while Sun Life
was represented by Edwin Hall.

THERE are several hurdles standing in the way of a recovery in
Scotland's commercial property market, including increases in business
rates and new planning rules.
Although the short- to medium-term prospects for the Scottish economy
are relatively bright, many occupiers are bracing themselves as rating
increases are phased in over the next five years, according to the 1995
Scottish Property Review published by surveyors DTZ Debenham Thorpe.
Developers are having to contend with recent Scottish Office
announcements on planning and land use while adapting to changes in
local government.
The report warns that future schemes are likely to face an increase in
the duration of local plan enquiries. Out-of-town shopping centres and
business parks will face greater opposition as the Government's
environmental legislation places greater emphasis on the re-use of brown
land within urban areas and restricts commercial development to existing
towns and city centres.
Richard Kwiecinski, chairman of DTZ Debenham Thorpe (Scotland), says:
''It is important that the creation of the new unitary authorities in
April 1996 does not impede the natural development process -- and that
any uncertainty experienced during the transition period is curtailed to
a minimum.''
Despite the challenges faced by the market, he is optimistic about the
prospects for the development market. ''Those developers brave enough
and commit themselves to well-located sites should benefit from an
upturn in the climate over the next four years.''
Key conclusions from the report:
* The office markets in the cities are experiencing a shortage of
prime accommodation. Although tenant demand in Glasgow and Edinburgh
remains patchy, rental growth prospects over the next 12 - 24 months are
encouraging.
* The outlook for the industrial market is less positive than that for
offices. Research shows that it continues to stagnate in the face of its
own unique problems -- traditionally, public-sector-driven, development
remains unattractive given present rental levels.
* Real rental growth is anticipated in all retail sectors -- with the
exception of one or two provincial towns and the food discount market.
* The leisure sector is set to emerge as a vibrant and acceptable
investor market with the prospect of at least five leisure parks,
anchored by major cinema investors, being developed over the next two
years.
These property trends are set against a relatively bright economic
backdrop with annual GDP growth rates of 2-3% over the next four years;
a return to a net increase in employment in 1996, and the development of
Scotland's gas and oil fields.
* Inward investment, which reached record levels in 1994/95 -- planned
investments totalling #1.1m were committed, resulting in the creation or
safeguarding of 12,300 jobs according to Locate In Scotland -- should
continue to rise.

CONRAD Black's Telegraph group suffered even more than the market had
been expecting from the newspaper price war with Rupert Murdoch's Times
in the first half of 1995.
The company was not helped by a 15% increase in the price of newsprint
and profits are down from #30.3m to #21.5m before tax although even this
includes #7.5m from an asset sale.
Stripping this out, profits dropped to #14m. If the #11.6m (#11.8m
last time) contribution from interests in associated companies taking in
the Australian Fairfax operation are also excluded along with interest,
then operating profits fell from #20.3m to just #5.6m on turnover down
from #136.3m to #121.4m. Market disappointment was reflected in a 20p
fall in the share price to 393p despite a maintained 5.5p interim
dividend and some optimistic comments from Mr Black.
The chairman yesterday said the first six months of 1995 have
undoubtedly been the period of ''fiercest competition for the
Telegraph's UK newspaper titles since the company moved from Fleet
Street nearly 10 years ago.'' In addition to a reduced cover price of
the weekday edition of the Daily Telegraph, the company invested heavily
in coupon-based weekend price promotions. This was aimed at creating the
conditions in which the price war could be successfully de-escalated.
The company considers this was achieved at the start of the third
quarter and consequently investment in these kind of promotions will
fall significantly in the current half. In the meantime, though, the
combination sliced almost #21m off circulation revenue compared to the
first half of 1994.
There has been a welcome easing in the price confrontation with 5p
cover price rises for both the Times and the Telegraph last month. The
company said this confirms that its decision in June 1994 to respond to
News International's dramatic price-cutting tactics head-on was the
correct one.
The Telegraph said that since then the Times has not made material
inroads on the Daily Telegraph's commanding circulation lead, despite a
90p six-day Telegraph price disadvantage.
The Daily Telegraph achieved a circulation of 1.072 million in June
1995, an increase of about 79,000 over May 1994, the month before the
cover price was reduced while over the same period the Sunday Telegraph
rose 59,000 to 706,000.
In contrast to circulation revenues, advertising continued to perform
well in the first half, rising by about #5m to offset some of the loss
of circulation income. One exception was financial advertising which
throughout the six months period was a poor performer compared to 1994.
For the second half, the Telegraph is looking for ''significantly
enhanced circulation revenue'' following the recent price increase, the
cessation next month of the weekend voucher promotion and a reduction in
wholesale and retail terms.
However, a further 30% increase in newsprint prices to be faced so
there will continue to be a tight pagination policy and the exploration
of every opportunity to reduce newsprint consumption.
Meanwhile, the chairman said that while cover prices have some way to
go before they return to prior levels, the easing of the competitive
climate and the continuing strong performance in advertising, coupled
with contributions from associated companies provide a more promising
outlook for the group. This augurs well for a return eventually to a
level of profitability achieved before prices were so dramatically cut,
hence the decision to hold the interim dividend at the same level as
last year.
Analysts, though, do not expect the share price to move very far for
the time being.

KVAERNER expects to announce in about a month's time whether its Govan
or German yard has won the contract to build the rocket transporter for
the Sea Launch programme.
That is designed to launch Russian satellite rockets from an ocean
platform in the Pacific Ocean on a commercial basis perhaps as from the
beginning of 1998.
The transporter will carry the rockets from Russia to the platform and
will in itself cost around #66m although Kvaerner was keeping silent
about the overall investment in the programme in which it has a 20%
stake. Other participants include Boeing, Energia of Russia which makes
the world's biggest rockets, and a Ukrainian space company.
However, it seems probable that there will be new contracts for the
more traditional activities such as chemical carriers signed within the
next few weeks.
Yesterday, the Norwegian shipbuilding and engineering giant said Govan
had made a small loss but believed that it should be reaching breakeven
by the year end.
Finance director Jan Magne Heggelund said that while there has been
increasing productivity, it was ''not yet acceptable''.
But he softened the blow by adding that in the European context,
Govan's productivity was acceptable but not as far as the Kvaerner group
is concerned.
It is widely thought there needs to be a 30% improvement which will
include increasing the amount of employee involvement in an enterprise
which was losing #40m a year before Kvaerner bought it from the
Government in 1988 for just #1.
Mr Heggelund was speaking after Norway's biggest company reported
pre-tax profits 88% greater at NKr1605m (#163m) for the first six
months.
Encouragingly shipbuilding prices are firming because of the strength
of the South Korean currency -- South Korea is a major ship constructor
-- and next year, there should be reduced Government-subsidised building
in Spain.
Oil and gas saw improvement despite poor results from the British
operations as a result of reduced North Sea activity.
Wood pulp machinery suffered from low priced contracts taken on in
1994. The current order book is rising rapidly but is unlikely to make
the necessary major leap forward until the US Government decides on
environmental controls.
This is against the background of a continuing shortage for both this
year and next and Mr Heggelund does not expect the market to get into
balance until perhaps 1998 -- and is rather jealous of the pulp
producers with costs of $450 and selling prices of more than $1000 a
tonne.
Overall profitability was helped by a massive #57.8m gain from the
sale of the gas carriers interests to fellow Norwegian company Havtor as
well as almost #16m of foreign exchange gains.

IT had been more years than he cared to remember since Ron Dawson had
last sat an exam. In fact, it was when he qualified as an associate
member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland, the
august body of which he is now a council member and past chairman. Yet
here he was, swotting and swearing his way through an intensive five-day
course, followed by an examination and assessment.
However harrowing, it was in a very good cause.
Now Ron Dawson not only has passed the CDM Regulations course run
jointly by the RICS and C-MIST on the Heriot-Watt campus at Riccarton,
Edinburgh, but he has become a founder member of the Institution of
Planning Supervisors, and is now one of the lecturers on the course.
He says: ''The surveyors taking the course will have on average more
than five years post-graduation experience, and they will have
sufficient general construction experience. We have to recognise that
there are also people who might have spent 20 years of their lives
totally in safety, but with little by way of formal qualifications. By
taking the course and passing the examination, they can become associate
members of the IPS, which has its headquarters on the Heriot-Watt
campus.
''I think it is important to recognise that CDM training provides
chartered surveyors with a focus on health and safety, which they didn't
previously have.
''The RICS in Scotland is a fairly autonomous body and there was an
interesting difference in emphasis between Edinburgh and London. The
London end felt that the introduction of the CDM Regulations was not an
earth-shaking matter, and the chartered surveyors would have the skills
as part of their training and experience, to take up the role of
planning supervisor.
''We do have a wide range of knowledge, like most professional people,
particularly in the construction industry, but risk assessment is not
the cornerstone of what we do, and in terms of health and safety it has
to be. Risk, both during construction and afterwards, must be identified
at the design stage and it must be eliminated -- or, where that is not
possible, minimised -- so that it is not a factor when the public use
the building.
''I think the decision of the RICS in Scotland to run this training in
conjunction with C-MIST speaks for itself. We aimed for 75 surveyors on
the courses and not only have we had well over 100 applicants from
Scotland, but there has been a number of enquiries from chartered
surveyors in England.''
It is now the responsibility of the client to appoint a competent
person as planning supervisor, so the client needs some measure of what
competence in CDM Regulations means. An experienced chartered surveyor
who has taken the five-day course, passed the examination and
assessment, and become a member of the Institution of Planning
Supervisors can give a client that necessary reassurance.
The role of planning supervisor is an addition to the conventional
team of architect, surveyor, engineer and contractors, and it has the
co-ordinating and awareness-raising function of ensuring that the
designer takes account of all potential hazards, from contaminated land
to drain connections on the far side of a busy main road. It also
involves assessing risk in alterations to existing buildings, and repair
and maintenance works -- reducing the chance of people falling off roofs
for example.
Ron Dawson who is a partner in the Edinburgh-based firm of Robertson
and Dawson adds: ''Safety in the industry had improved over a number of
years, but the improvement had reached a plateau. Hard hats are not yet
used as widely as they should be. I still go on building sites where the
hard hats are lying on top of the scaffolding, while the men clamber all
over the place.
''You only have to hit a scaffolding pole without a hard hat to know
the sort of damage that can do, never mind something falling on to your
head from a height.''
The duty of advising the client of his CDM responsibilities has been
put on the designers, whether the client goes the conventional route and
asks an architect to design a building, or goes the design-and-build
route, where a contractor takes over the duties of a design team.
''Whichever route the client takes, he has the responsibility at law
to ensure that the proper appointments are made and proper consideration
is given. If there is a major problem, the Health and Safety Executive
may well take action against the client, as well as others, and we are
dealing here with criminal law and not with the civil courts, as was the
case with negligence.
''In my practice, we have standing information on the responsibilities
and relationships of everyone in the construction process, and this goes
out to every client, regardless of their level of knowledge.
''I see the CDM Regulations as a clever mechanism for ensuring that
health and safety have to be addressed each time some form of
construction takes place. They bring home to all who are involved in the
construction industry that when people and buildings come into violent
contact, it is the people who come off worse.''

A FIFE-based company will create about 50 new jobs in Glenrothes as
part of an ambitious #2m expansion programme.
Buko, one of Europe's leading manufacturers of supermarket equipment,
also plans to make further increases in its workforce during the next
five years.
Last year, Glenrothes had a net gain of 1073 jobs -- the highest of
any Scottish New Town. The recent annoucement by Japanese electronics
giant, Canon, of a #10m investment which will initially create 220 new
jobs -- but could eventually generate almost double that total -- at the

Glenrothes Development Corporation general manager John McCombie,
welcomed Buko's plans to expand.
He said: ''This is terrific news, especially as it involves one of our
longest established companies, underlining the stability of the

SCOTLAND'S diverse farming communities should promote their industry
more effectively to ensure the current high level of subsidies remains
secure, according to the Scottish Office Minister of Agriculture, Lord
Lindsay.
The Minister, speaking yesterday in Lairg, Sutherland, at Europe's
largest one-day sale of sheep where 37,000 Cheviot lambs from all over
the North of Scotland were on offer, had both good and bad news to
report. On the former side, he announced that sheep producers would
shortly receive the vast bulk of this year's SAP payments.
He said: ''We are starting now and we hope to have #50m out of a total
of #80m paid out by mid-September -- and that will be three months
quicker than last year.''
Responding to the inevitable question about how the high level of
subsidies could be sustained, he said: ''There is pressure for change
and duty to both taxpayers and consumers to make sure we have sensible
changes in the CAP.
''These changes will be evolutionary but this Government wants to
support farms who are crucial to the rural fabric of Scotland.''
The message is not a new one but Lord Lindsay gave it a new twist when
he warned: ''Farmers must show themselves to be the obvious recipients
of the subsidies. The danger is that farmers may not be seen as the best
people to spend that money and that it will be diverted to other
organisations.
''It's terribly important that farmers have a better PR. They, after
all, have been in operation for almost 1000 years. I understand that
they feel they are not being thanked for what they do, but their past
record is excellent.''
When asked whether he believed farmers fully appreciated these
subsidies, he added: ''I hope so -- but like everyone else they want
more.''
He was quick to highlight that in 1984 #70m had been paid out to the
LFAs, while this year expenditure will exceed #200m. Meanwhile, the
total of subsidies paid out to Scottish farmers this year is likely to
pass #350m.
Farmer Andrew Elliot of Balnakeil, Durness, who had 900 lambs at Lairg
yesterday, said that without subsidy income, ''farming in our area would
be a lost cause''.
Expanding on this theme, he said: ''Farming is vital to the local
economy. There is little else and even the tourist industry has a very
short season, lasting no more than three months. Any reduction in
subsidies would be a total disaster.''
The Lairg trade yesterday defied all expectations. The principal
auctioneer, David Leggat of United Auctions, commented: ''I'm very
heartened by the attendance of buyers from all over the UK. All the
usual contingent are here, but there are also several new faces which we
didn't expect in view of the shortage of keep.''
Individual sellers were delighted by the overall trade. George Murray
from Morvich, near Rogart, said: ''I've been coming here for 61 years
and I've not seen the lambs so good in 25 years. We are up between #6
and #7 on our ewe lambs with the second draw up by #11.''
That trend was reflected in the wedder ring where many of the smaller
lambs soared in price, even above the high level of two years ago. But
the big question remains -- can the feeders make a profit from the sheep
when they come to sell them early in 1996?

A CALL for the transformation of agriculture subsidies into a system
of social support for farmers working in difficult situations was made
yesterday by a North-east farmer.
Graham Forbes, one of three brothers who form a farming dynasty in
Kincardineshire, said: ''I think to give the grain barons of
Lincolnshire the subsidies they are getting is hellish.''
He argued that a method should be devised of paying farmers to stay on
the hills, rather than linking this to production.
Before subsidies came in, he said, farmers were getting #110 a tonne
for wheat. Now -- with no great rise in production costs -- they were
getting this plus a #100 subsidy.
He attacked the European set-aside system as ''increasingly daft''. It
only needed drought or floods in America and any cereals surplus in the
world market would disappear.
He added that he and his brothers, John and Mike, had set up their
operation to be unsubsidised where possible. They have about 4000 acres
of cereals and a similar amount of unsupported crops such as peas and
beans.
John Forbes suggested that all farmers should be preparing for the day
when there would be no subsidies. ''We have always been planning for
that time -- that is why we are into peas and beans and pigs,'' he said.
The brothers admitted they collected whatever subsidies were due to
them -- ''but it is getting to the stage where it is very, very
difficult to justify,'' said Graham.
They were speaking before the official opening of a modernised animal
feed mill at Drumlithie, near Stonehaven, for East Coast Viners Grain,
which forms part of their enterprise.
Their #500,000 investment at the mill has doubled capacity from 25,000
tonnes a year to 50,000, supplying dairy, beef, sheep and pig producers
throughout North-east and Central Scotland.
* RISING grain prices, while good news for arable farmers, will work
to the detriment of the livestock producer, according to BOCM Pauls --
Britain's leading animal food compounder.
The shortage of grain in Europe meant much of the UK cereal harvest
would be committed for export, leading to increased prices on the home
market, it said.
Despite the rise in grain exports the company has no fears for its own
supply situation, describing its sources as ''strong and reliable''.
With purchasing costs remaining high, however, it sees less opportunity
for implementing the kind of price cut customers expect at this time of
the year.
Trends on the UK futures market suggest a continuation of firmer feed
prices. Forward prices for September and November put wheat at between
#9 and #10 a tonne higher than at the same time last year.

HEWLETT-Packard's operation at South Queensferry, which has more than
doubled its turnover during the last three years, was one of the drivers
of a 66% leap in the US-based group's third-quarter net earnings to
$576m (#372m).
The three divisions at South Queensferry, which between them employ
nearly 1200 people, design, manufacture and market telecommunications
test instruments and systems.
Hewlett-Packard's entire test-and-measurement business, which takes in
the South Queensferry operation, achieved a 23% increase in orders
during the third quarter to end-July. This was its fifth consecutive
quarter of growth in excess of 20%.
South Queensferry exports about 95% of its products, principally to
Continental Europe, North America and the Far East.
Hewlett-Packard's third-quarter net revenue was 28% higher at $7700m
(#4968m).
In the UK, where it also has operations at Ipswich and Bristol,
exports in the third quarter were 63% higher than in the same three
months of the previous year.

* PAUL Broadhurst tees off in the Czech Open at Marianske Lazne today
determined to force his way into the European Ryder Cup team.
Four years ago a late burst of form enabled him to gain selection and
he is currently nineteenth in the cup points list with just the Czech
and German Opens to go before Bernard Gallacher names his side on August
28 for next month's match against the Americans.
Five players, Colin Montgomerie, Bernhard Langer, Sam Torrance,
Costantino Rocca and Seve Ballesteros have already collected enough
points to be certain of selection, and Broadhurst says: ''I think two
more spots will be decided by the end of this week and then the other
places will be up for grabs in Germany.''
Gallacher's two wild cards are likely to go to Nick Faldo, currently
campaigning in America, and Jose Maria Olazabal, whose appearances this
season have been restricted by a foot injury.

A FIRST appearance by Nancy Lopez will guarantee large crowds this
week at Woburn, where Sweden's Lotta Neumann tees off today in defence
of her Weetabix Women's British Open title.
Lopez, the Arnold Palmer of women's golf, lifted the LPGA Tour to its
present prosperity when she made a staggering entry into the
professional arena. She won nine events, including five in a row, in
1978, and eight the following year. Lopez has won 47 LPGA events, the
last two years ago, and over $4m in prize money.
Even though she has cut down her schedule to 15 tournaments a year,
Lopez still believes she can win. ''I am hitting the ball really well
this week,'' said Lopez.
Neumann has not won this year, but a fast-running course will not
unduly cause too many problems for the Swede, who is one of the
straightest hitters in golf, which is hardly Laura Davies's strength.
Winning the Welsh Open last Sunday was a fifth win of the season for
Davies, who has also won over the Duke's course. Even so, she is playing
down her chances. ''It is difficult to win back-to-back,'' she says.
''It's all about playing well and taking chances when you get them.''
Accuracy from the tee will be the key this week, which will be to the
liking of Alison Nicholas, who won the Scottish Open at Dalmahoy, and
Annika Sorenstam, who has the chance of emulating Patty Sheehan by
winning both the US and British Opens in the same year.
Scotland's main hopes are likely to be Dale Reid, Kathryn Marshall,
Pam Wright and Catriona Matthew, who is making her first appearance in
Europe this year.

FERGUS Wallace's move from GHK to Boroughmuir has provoked a storm in
Glasgow rugby circles as to whether he should now be allowed to play for
his home district, having elected to play for an Edinburgh club.
But it appears that the Glasgow committee will keep last year's
eligibility rules and allow him to play for Glasgow if fit.
''All of us come into this game to play rugby for Scotland,'' says
Wallace, who is remembered for that try against the Springboks at
Melrose. ''That has always been my ambition and it still is.''
So, did he think that playing for a Glasgow club was in some way a
hindrance to getting his coveted cap?
He denies the accusation.''All I'm saying is that it wasn't the best
thing for me to stay. It was a hard decision to make, and I have the
full backing of my family,'' he says. ''I think that Boroughmuir are a
good outfit, and my game will improve.
''I don't have much longer left in me, and I need to move quickly. I
hope to play for Glasgow despite playing my club rugby in Edinburgh. In
fact, I would only play for Glasgow, because it's where I come from.
Even supposing Glasgow wouldn't pick me, I can say that I still wouldn't
want to play for Edinburgh. It just wouldn't be right.''
Glasgow convener Hamish Fyfe said that his committee's duty was to
pick the best XV available and their existing policy would be maintained
-- ''selecting players who have played for the district in the past,
although they may not still be playing club rugby in Glasgow.''
He added: ''There has been considerable speculation over the movement
of players this summer, but I do not believe that a change in our
selection policy would have affected the decision of the players to move
or not.''
But West of Scotland backs coach Sandy Service, a former scrum half to
Fyfe in Glasgow sides of yesteryear, argues: ''I am not keen on rugby
mercenaries, and I think that players playing for Glasgow clubs should
represent the district.''
Brian Williams, the Glasgow Southern president, agrees. ''We should
not allow players playing outside Glasgow to play for the district,'' he
said. ''It undermines our club game.''
This topic has even provoked some family heartache in the past, most
notably when Brian Simmers, the former international stand-off, didn't
believe that his son, Chris, should have been allowed to play for
Glasgow as an Edinburgh Academical player.

BRITISH GIRLS
SCOTLAND produced a determined comeback to register a 5[1/2]-3[1/2]
victory over Ireland in their second match of the girls' home
international series at Northop Park yesterday.
Having already taken a foursomes 2-1 lead, the Irish led in three of
the singles at the turn.
However, Scotland had other ideas and it was Heather Stirling who
sparked a dramatic recovery. At one stage she was three down to Gemma
Hegarty but got back to level and then forged ahead on the sixteenth. At
the seventeenth she made a superb sand save and then won the eighteenth
in par.
At the top of the order Laura Moffat had already secured Scotland's
first point of the afternoon. Claire Hunter was dormie two down to
Elaine Dowdall but won the seventeenth with a birdie and the eighteenth
in par for a crucial half.
Karen Burns chipped in at the last for a two-hole success over Denise
Doyle and Scotland's other point was provided by Lesley Mackay. Results:
Scotland 5[1/2], Ireland 3[1/2]. Foursomes (Scots first) -- L Moffat
and S McEwan lost to P Murphy and D Doyle 2 and 1; C Hunter and K Burns
lost to G Hegarty and E Dowdall 5 and 4; H Stirling and F Lockhart beat
A O'Leary and M Dowling 2 and 1.
Singles -- Moffat beat Murphy 2 and 1; Stirling beat Hegarty two up;
McEwan lost to O'Leary 3 and 1; Hunter halved with Dowdall; Burns beat
Doyle two up; L Mackay beat J Bradley 2 and 1.
England 5, Wales 4.

GRANITE CITY CLASSIC
SCOTTISH champion Colin Gillies treated the Hazlehead course with
respect yesterday and got his just rewards when his course
record-breaking seven-under-par 63 gave him a two-stroke lead at the
halfway stage of the #12,500 Granite City Classic.
The 29-year-old Falkirk professional only removed the driver four
times from his bag on the tree-lined municipal course in Aberdeen, but
his steady iron play laid the foundation for seven birdies in a flawless
round.
''If you just look at the card you might think that, at only 6204
yards, it is just a drive and a flick, but because you have to play
irons off most tees to be safe, it is not that short,'' said Gillies.
''But I was really pleased with the way I played and it's as good, if
not perhaps better, than I played when I won the Scottish title at
Dalmahoy.
''I also only had 28 putts, which is a nice bonus.''
Gillies will be pursued into today's final 18 holes by three players
who ended their opening rounds two strokes adrift on 65 -- David
Thomson, Brian Marchbank and Colin Brooks.
Big-hitting Thomson did not quite follow the same safe line as the
leader, an example coming at the 476-yard 17th, where a drive lashed 340
yards left only a wedge to the green and a two-foot putt for an eagle
three.
Marchbank admitted that, although today is important, his main goal
for the rest of the season is to rise the 30 places required to get into
the top 120 on the Volvo European Tour, who will retain their card for
next season.
''I've got invites to a few events so if I can do well in those and
perhaps get a few more, I feel I'm playing well enough to get the money
I need,'' he said. Leading scores:
63 -- C Gillies (Falkirk).
65 -- D Thomson (Kings Links), B Marchbank (Marchbank Golf
Enterprises), C Brooks (Glencorse).
66 -- S Thompson (Gleddoch), S Stephen (Braid Hills), D Scott (Letham
Grange).
67 -- D Fleming (Turnberry Hotel), D Vannet (Peterculter).
68 -- C Ronald (East Kilbride), R Weir (Cowal), K Stables (Montrose),
S Martin (North Engineering).
69 -- K Nairn (Hilton Park), S Kerr (Renfrew), I Young (Braid Hills),
W Guy (Buchanan Castle), F Mann (Musselburgh), G Collinson (Windyhill),
K Fairbairn (Goswick), S Henderson (Kings Links), F Coutts (Deeside).
70 -- D McKay (Ladybank), R Arnott (Caddy Shack), A Webster (Edzell),
G Forbes (Aberdeen Petroleum Club).

<HEADLINE>Exclusive: WRC scheme out in the open. Rebels' plans for world domination revealed</HEADLINE>

THE audacity of the scheme by the World Rugby Corporation to grab
control of the global game is revealed in the plan drawn up by the
Australian, Ross Turnbull, a copy of which has been obtained by The
Herald.
The document, headed ''Strictly Private and Confidential,'' outlines
the steps by which Turnbull, who is said to be backed by Australian
media millionaire Kerry Packer, would buy up more than 1000 of the
world's top players and then offer or perhaps sell -- on this point the
document is unclear -- the game back to the existing national, state,
and provincial authorities by giving them first refusal on new
geographical franchises.
The fact that WRC intended to undermine the existing structure by
signing up the game's top performers was well known. However, the
confidential document reveals in detail that WRC's ultimate aim is not
just to run a global, televised, professional tournament, but to
dominate the game.
The attempted coup by Turnbull -- which seems less likely to succeed
as each day passes -- is taking place against a backdrop of activity
within the game.
On the eve of the World Cup final Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation
signed an exclusive, #370m broadcasting deal with the Australian, South
African, and New Zealand unions which gives him TV control over
top-grade rugby in the Southern Hemisphere for 10 years. The Murdoch
monopoly in Southern Hemisphere rugby followed a similar deal with rugby
league, which gives News Corporation something approaching worldwide
domination.
Strengthened by the existence of the Murdoch cash, the Southern
Hemisphere unions pushed harder for a professional game, a situation
which was under review. It meets in Paris next week to make a final
decision.
The Scottish Rugby Union, alone of the home unions, has declared that,
if the IB can come to agreement, it will embrace a professional game and
that its players be placed under contract. The appearance on the scene
of Turnbull and his WRC, linked, it is said to Packer who has to defend
his television interests,has undoubtedly forced the hand of the
amateurism stalwarts on the IB.
Leaving aside the question of where WRC games would be played, the
major hurdle facing Turnbull is that of which broadcaster would transmit
his games? BBC is commited to the existing Five nations, Murdoch's BSkyB
is out of the question, and ITV has links with the traditional unions,
having bought exclusive rights to the last two World Cup tournaments.
The Turnbull coup is dependent upon an all-or-nothing scenario.
The confidential WRC document makes it clear that the key to success
lay in attracting players to his cause. Under the heading: ''Vision of
the players,'' the document states: ''WRC's vision will only be realised
if the players seek it to be realised. It is a vision of the players for
the benefit of the players, and will only be achieved through the
players.''
The secrecy under which Turnbull and an associated company, Wentworth
Associates Pty Ltd, hoped to conduct their takeover of the game is
underlined in a heavy-handed warning to recipients of the blueprint not
to divulge its contents.
The report's executive summary declares: ''WRC's vision is to
transform rugby by taking it into a new, exciting era of professionalism
while protecting its history and origins.
''The WRC will be the controlling body of the world organisation for
professional rugby. It will initially own all the commercial rights and
entitlements for WRC and its franchised areas, being all television
rights (both free-to-air and pay-for view), all marketing and
merchandising rights and all other revenue areas, including corporate
sponsorships and ticket sales.
''Initially, the WRC will comprise three conferences -- northern,
central, and southern, which represents the sections of the world with
the strongest rugby history and potential for marketing for world rugby.
Each of the three conferences will have its own board of management to
control and operate their affairs under the overseeing guidelines and
operating criteria of the WRC. There will be a minimum of 10 regional
teams in each conference.
''The traditional rugby authorities (national, state, provincial,
club, schools, juniors, and referees) will be maintained and continue to
act as a feeder system for professional rugby. WRC also proposes that
such authorities would be given first option to become franchisees in
their particular countries, states, provinces, or regions. Funding for
the maintenance and development of these traditional and growth areas
will be provided from the WRC budget.
''There will be three major competitions organised by the WRC -- the
conference championships, the world conference championship final
series, and an international world series championship. A total of 352
games of top-class rugby will be played, each of which will lend itself
to a two-hour television coverage or total television time of 704 hours.
''There will be 30 teams (minimum) within the three conferences and 35
players and other personnel, making 1050 on the WRC payroll.
''The major advantage is that the top echelon of players will be
compensated financially in terms which are comparable with those they
would be likely to receive from rugby league, thus ensuring that there
are no material losses in player strength to rugby league and the
structure, environment, and ethos of rugby can be maintained.''
The executive summary concludes: ''Furthermore, WRC provides an avenue
for all players to gain professional status without being lost to the
game. The traditional rugby authorities (national, state, province, and
regions) will be able to join with the players by taking up the
franchises that will be offered to them by WRC.''
WRC raises the spectre of Murdoch's global media power as a incentive
for union players to sign up. The document, which is undated, makes no
mention of News Corporation's monopolistic position within the union
game in the Southern Hemisphere and the deal negotiated with the three
Southern Hemisphere unions, but issues this warning: ''Recently, a major
revolution has taken place in the game of rugby league and the
'takeover' by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. This has created an
environment in which rugby will need to become more fully professional
to survive.
''The game of international rugby football is at risk as a result of
the News Corporation takeover of rugby league. It is a stated policy of
News Corporation that there will be only one major football code, and
that will be rugby league. The game will be globalised and run under the
News Corporation banner and linked directly through the company's
worldwide satellite television.''
Turnbull envisages a global pyramid with regional teams playing in
each of the three conferences and the three top sides, plus a wild-card
team, progressing to the seven-game, world conference championship
finals at a centralised venue.
Under the heading: ''Important comment,'' WRC declare: ''Each
conference would stage international matches on historical lines -- the
Five Nations', Bledisloe Cup fixtures etc, would remain although the
names of these competitions or fixtures may change.''
Additionally, there also would be a Test rugby world series. The
northern conference teams would be England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales,
France, and Italy. The combined southern/central conference participants
would be Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, Fiji, and
Western Samoa. Teams in each conference would play the other twice on a
home-and-away basis. The conference champions would then proceed to the
International World Series Championship final.
Each team, no matter the level, says WRC, would comprise a playing
squad of 30 plus a coach, trainer, manager, physiotherapist, and
masseur. All would be hired on a professional basis.
Referees, too, would become full-time professionals contracted to WRC
and the masterplan also calls for a coordinated, worldwide season
running from March to October.

THE strength of retail sales in July could prove to be a more
significant portent than the first rise in unemployment for 23 months.
The 0.4% increase in the volume of sales last month was accompanied by
widespread revisions to the historic figures. As a result, sales also
rose by 0.4% in June against the previous indication that they had been
flat.
Following the revisions, sales grew by 1% in the second quarter,
suggesting that the consumer has been coming back to life after a 0.1%
decline in overall spending in the first quarter.
The run of figures indicates that retail sales were in gentle decline
from the end of September until the spring when they started to pick-up
again. They are now clearly in record-breaking territory.
It takes a lot to keep the consumer in check. Hefty tax increases over
two fiscal years and a 1.5% rise in interest rates in five months are
now part of economic history. The introduction of the National Lottery
probably had an adverse effect on sales over the winter months.
July's fine weather gave a boost to retail sales, especially of
clothing and footwear which increased by 1.6% between June and July and
3.2% on a year ago.
But there were also significant gains in household goods and food
sales. In the latest three months total sales rose by 0.7% and were 1.4%
higher than in the same three months a year ago. Again, the biggest
advance was in clothing and footwear, where the comparable gains were
1.7% and 2.9%.
Worst performer was the new category of non-store retailing and
repair, which is dominated by mail order and delivery services (such as
milk rounds) which are losing market share. Here sales fell by 1.2% in
the latest three months and 6% from the same three months a year ago.
Even after excluding the effect of the weather, the figures suggest
retail sales are perking up more quickly than previously thought. If
spending on services has also remained strong, the data are consistent
with an acceleration in the growth rate in the second half of the year.
Undoubtedly the economic entrails are becoming more difficult to read.
The economy has certainly been slowing down in the last 12 months, and
it is not clear whether this process has ended. The manufacturing sector
could be weakened by de-stocking in the months ahead.
The unemployment figures for July sport the first increase since
August 1993. But the seasonally adjusted rise of 1700 followed a revised
drop of just 3800 in June.
Monthly unemployment figures have tended to move in multiples of
10,000. So the recent figures suggest that the current trend is flat,
which would be consistent with the pace of economic activity slowing
down to around a growth rate of 2.25%.
The jury is out on unemployment. The July figures could be a blip or
the start of a trend. However, if early indications of a pick-up in the
economy in the second half of the year are validated, unemployment
should start to resume its downward move, albeit at a much slower pace
than in the second half of last year when the average monthly decline
was nearly 38,000.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, is hardly likely to
agree to a rise in interest rates while unemployment is rising. In any
event the recent volatility in foreign exchange markets, from which
sterling has benefited, provides a further reason for expecting interest
rates to stay on hold for some months yet.
Indeed, the recovery in sterling may well be enough for the Bank of
England to relax its view on base rates and agree with Mr Clarke's
wait-and-see policy.
The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement last month came in at #724m, a
big decline from June's #3515m. But the major part of the improvement is
accounted for by corporation tax receipts, which were 21% higher than in
July last year. July is the third biggest month for the collection of
taxes from the corporate sector.
After the first four months of the fiscal year the PSBR stands at
#12bn, a modest improvement on the same period last year when the
shortfall was #12.7bn.
The PSBR for 1994/95 has been revised up by #1100m to #35.9bn. The
Government is forecasting a total of #23.6bn for the current year, but
seems likely to miss its target.
The main problem is a shortfall in revenues, mainly caused by the
slowdown in the economy. Growth so far is running at 8.6%, but the
Government forecast that revenues would be 10.8% higher. So there is a
lot of catching up to do, even if the economy perks up in the second
half and corporation tax continues to pour in.
Mr Clarke could face problems in convincing financial markets, which
have to fund the deficit (and the increase in last year's), that he is
justified in cutting taxes for reasons which are essentially political.

ONE of Scotland's oldest jewellery firms has expanded into England for
the first time in its 155-year history.
Laing the Jeweller has bought the even older Southampton firm of
Parkhouse &amp; Wyatt for an undisclosed sum which is reputedly well into
six figures.
The deal is especially significant because the Southampton shop, where
17 are employed, has the highest turnover of any single jewellery
retailer in England -- outside of London.
Mr Michael Laing, joint managing director of the Scottish company
which has four shops in Glasgow and Edinburgh, last night signalled that
more acquisitions will follow. He said: ''This is a major step forward
in our growth plans but is not the end. We will continue to keep our
eyes open for suitable businesses that blend into our trading style.
Another two or three would do fine.''
Laing intends to retain the name of Parkhouse &amp; Wyatt, which dates
back to 1794, but will invest in key areas of the business to increase
an annual turnover already standing at between #2m-#3m.
The Glasgow-based firm's trawl in the south has lasted almost a year,
with several previous take-over bids foiled only after owners changed
their mind and took them off the market.
Laing's expansion plans comes amid fierce competition from multiple
chains for a share of its upper end of the market in Scotland, but
turnover and profits have still been on the up'.
The firm, already employing 85 staff, is official sponsor of the
Scottish Rugby Union, and also operates an Order of Merit for Scottish
ladies' amateur golfers.

ALHAARTH, ante-post favourite for the next season's Epsom Derby, is
one of 34 entries for the Group 2 Champagne Stakes at Doncaster on
September 8. Dick Hern's Unfuwain colt is the 8-1 market leader for the
premier classic, having won both his starts to date.
The youngster began his career with a win in a 16-runner Newmarket
maiden before registering an impressive success in the Group 3 Lanson
Champagne Stakes at Goodwood.
He will bid to consolidate his position at the head of the Derby list
in the Group 3 Solario Stakes at Sandown on Friday. A decision as to his
participation in the Champagne Stakes will be made after Friday's race.
''He runs at Sandown on Friday but the plan is to go to Doncaster, as
long as they get that man who doped Bravefoot out of the way,'' said
trainer Dick Hern. ''The horse was fine when I last saw him and that was
a couple of hours ago.''
However, those availing themselves of the 8-1 about the colt winning
at Epsom are silly, according to Hern. ''People must be mad to take that
price about him now. I should think it is about 8-1 him running in the
Derby,'' he said.
The stable's Bravefoot started favourite for the race five years ago
but trailed in a distressed last behind Bog Trotter. He was subsequently
found to have been administered with a sedative.

IT was 90[0] in York yesterday, but the coolest man at the races was
Willie Carson. The veteran Scot, 55 next birthday, drove the 8-1 shot
Sanmartino to a short-head victory in the Tote Ebor Handicap -- then
announced he had not been concerned at any stage.
''In the run-in with Midyan Blue, his jockey Neil Kennedy gave me a
little bump and my mount lost his stride,'' said Carson. ''If I hadn't
won in the photo-finish I would had taken it in the steward's room.''
Carson kept Sanmartino in mid-division for most of the race, but was
content to wait, saying: ''He likes the fast ground and he has a grand,
big stride. His trainer, Barry Hills, had given me no instructions
except to go out and win. I like that -- only bad trainers give you
specific orders.''
A delighted Hills revealed he had backed Sanmartino at 14s and 16s
''but that was before I knew I definitely had Willie on board. He had to
be sure he had no commitments for his regular trainers, and he kept me
waiting a couple of weeks. It was worth it because he would be my first
choice for every race.''
Sanmarino and Midyan Blue burst clear three furlongs from home and
fought out a thrilling battle in the closing stages, with the Mary
Reveley-trained Foundry Lane third.
From some angles it looked as though the 28-1 outsider had just nicked
it but Willie headed straight for the winner's enclosure.
Has the wee man they call the George Foreman of the track any thoughts
of retiring? ''Pull yourself together, I'm just a lad. Ride like one
anyway,'' he claimed.
If there were cheers for Willie, there was just as warm a reception
for Sea Pigeon, the 1979 Ebor winner, who led the parade. Jonjo O'Neill
was his partner when he carried a record weight for a winner of 10st.
Sea Pigeon is now 25-years-old. ''And before anyone asks,'' said
Carson, ''that makes him older than me.''
The heat, of course, was not allowed to interfere with the rules of
this very up-market meeting. This is England, after all. Gentlemen shall
wear jackets and ties to enter the main grandstand, plus all associated
bars and lounges.
Bill has been letting them in and throwing them out of the County
Stand for the last 20 years. ''I've never known a meeting like it,'' he
confessed.
''Just before the first race a punter tried to get past me with a tie
and a sports shirt. When I hauled him up he turned to his wife, who was
wearing a pink jacket, and promptly put on hers.
''Then some girl tries to come in with no shoes -- she demands to know
where it says she has to wear them.''
Indeed, in the dress stakes, the women were the clear winners. A
backless number, defying the law of gravity at the front, sizzled by,
while another lady sported a matching number of leather top hat and
skirt. The hat was considerably longer than the skirt . . . not that I
spent a lot of time looking.
Finally, a lady with a titfer fringed by feathers, which bird donated
them is not known, promptly set the outfit alight with a careless flick
of her fag. Fortunately, husband, who was honestly called Henry, was on
hand to douse the flames with champagne. How the better half lives.
In the popular terraces two shirtless gentlemen were warned over the
PA to remove themselves from the vicinity of the finishing line. ''You
are acting illegally,'' came the message, though I was not sure whether
the offence was being where they were or displaying their chests.
Several bookmakers were beginning to wish they had been invited to go
as well. In the opener, No Monkey Nuts was favourite and obliged in
style.
The best-backed horse, Pure Grain also took the Yorkshire Oaks, while
in the Gimcrack Stakes, odds-on Royal Applause came out on the winning
side of the picture in a battle with Tumbleweed Ridge.
As I had backed both I was by this time residing in the champagne tent
with Henry.

THE brewing group Whitbread has returned to the fray in its battle
against the increasing activity of beer bootleggers.
The company yesterday claimed that bootlegged beer from the Continent
created retail losses in Scotland alone last year of about #24m. This is
up on the #20m it estimated for 1993 and works out at #4000 for every
off-licence in the country.
About one-third of the beer brought into Scotland is shipped in vans,
the bulk of it illegally imported.
About seven vans cross the Border each day on average or around 2500 a
year. The vehicles have the capacity to carry eight times the indicated
allowance of 110 litres of beer per person.
The beneficiaries, apart from the smugglers and their customers, are
the 33 cash and carry outlets in Calais catering solely for the British
trade -- a doubling in number in two years.

BRITISH BOYS' CHAMPIONSHIP
HALF of the eight players now remaining in the British Boys'
Championship are Scots -- caps Steven Young, Craig Lee, Graham Fox, and
Stewart Whiteford -- following the fourth and fifth rounds at Dunbar
yesterday.
Scottish domination of the event seems a natural progression after
their victory last week at the Home Countries International matches and
their subsequently strong representation in the Great Britain and
Ireland team which defeated the Continent of Europe.
With one Scot in each quarter of the draw, their continued success in
the Championship is almost assured.
Fox ended the hopes of yet another English internationalist when he
defeated Jamie Little of Moor Park 4 and 3 in the fourth round. Little,
a hot tip to reach the final stages, had no answer to the four-under-par
figures over the first five holes which Fox produced. The West Kilbride
club champion then went on to defeat Sweden's Joachim Backstrom 3 and 2.
Triple Scottish champion Young was three under for his 17 holes when
he defeated Mark Hilton, of Lewes, 3 and 1, winning holes No.15 and 16
with birdies. He then put paid to David Kershaw, of Silkstone, by 2 and
1.
Scottish Strokeplay Champion Craig Lee posted an impressive 4 and 3
win over fellow Scot Sandy Aird, whose father is the professional at
Forres. He was three under par for the round and hit every green except
for the fourteenth. Similar steady figures earned him a 4 and 2
fifth-round win over Richard Brown, of Shifnal.
Lundin's Stewart Whiteford, at 16 the youngest Scottish cap remaining
in the field, won 5 and 4 against Jamie Gallacher, of Wentworth, the son
of Ryder Cup captain, Bernard. He then produced a resounding 5 and 4 win
over Andrew March, of Enmore Park. Scottish scores:
Fourth round -- C Duke (Porters Bar) beat J McMahon (Cardross) 3 and
1; C Lee (Stirling) beat S Aird (Forres) 4 and 3; G Fox (West Kilbride)
beat J Little (Moor Park) 4 and 3; M Donaldson (Kirkcaldy) beat S Garcia
(Spain) 1 hole; D Lucas (Worksop) beat S Horne (Tulliallan) 2 and 1; S
Young (Inverallochy) beat M Hilton (Lewes) 3 and 1; S Whiteford (Lundin)
beat J Gallacher (Wentworth) 5 and 4; L Ringrose (East Sussex National)
beat D Muir (Dunbar) 4 and 3.
Fifth round -- Lee beat R Brown (Shifnal) 4 and 2; Fox beat J
Backstrom (Sweden) 3 and 2;  D Lucas (Worksop) beat Donaldson 3 and 2;
Young beat Kershaw 2 and 1; Whiteford beat A March (Enmore Park) 5 and
4.

Investment capital group 3i, which put in money after the company
became the subject of a Creditors' Voluntary Arrangement in 1992, has
taken its total stake in the company to almost #700,000 with an
injection of additional equity.
Scottish Development Finance, the direct investment arm of Scottish
Enterprise, has also put up more equity, with Bank of Scotland providing
additional debt.
Bill Fleming, the founder of the Smiley tyre and exhaust centre chain
who was recently plunged into personal bankruptcy by the collapse of his
own Tower Bookshops retail venture, resigned as chairman of Geddes &amp;
Grosset earlier this year.
He had joined the company in March last year, taking a minority stake.
Alan Hyslop, an investment executive at 3i's Glasgow office, stressed
that losses arising from dealings between Tower and Geddes &amp; Grosset
were ''inconsequential''.
Although 3i had to put in more money about a year ago to bolster
Geddes &amp; Grosset, Mr Hyslop said the book company was now storming
ahead.
The firm was founded in 1988 by former Collins' employees David Geddes
and Ron Grosset. The arrival of Mike Miller in 1992, after the sale of
the Blackie book business which he used to run, helped secure the
backing of 3i.
During the last three years, Geddes &amp; Grosset has built up a
substantial portfolio of titles and copyrights. It should turn over
about #3m in the current 12 months to December, with sales expected to
grow to about #4m next year.
Geddes &amp; Grosset publishes general reference books and illustrated
titles for children under its own name. Its books are to be found in
non-traditional outlets, such as supermarkets and service stations, as
well as in bookshops.
The company is also making inroads into North America, Continental
Europe, Australia, and the Middle East.
On the ''packaging'' side, Geddes &amp; Grosset compiles and designs
full-sized and pocket dictionaries on subjects ranging from astronomy to
architecture, for delivery to the likes of Hodder Headline company
Brockhampton Press and Penguin group Claremont Books.
It is also involved in a joint venture with publishing giant Time
Life. More than 100 titles have been re-packaged from Time Life's
archive in the last 18 months.

A ROW is growing on charges Crest, the new stock market settlement
system, proposes to make which are said to put small investors at a
disadvantage.
A flat-rate Crest transaction charge of #2.10 is being suggested which
would compare with the present value-related Talisman charge of 75p for
a #1000 deal. At the level of a #5000 deal the difference is negligible.
The Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers
(APCIMS) and ProShare, the body which encourages wider share ownership,
are upset about the proposals.
''We believe that paper-based investors, who are currently responsible
for a large majority of the transactions effected on the Stock Exchange,
will be penalised,'' said APCIMS chairman John Cobb.
ProShare chief executive Gill Nott called on the Stock Exchange to
investigate the impact of Crest dealing charges.
The Crest system is being developed by a Bank of England panel and is
designed to be fully electronic, doing away with the present paper-based
system, Talisman.
However, small investors could continue to deal much as they do at
present if they wish. Crest has suggested in a consultative document a
flat rate charge of 160p per bargain. In addition, there would be a
network charge of 50p making #2.10 in total.
In contrast, the present Talisman charge starts at 75p for a #1000
bargain. One three times as large would cost #1.55. These charges are
included in the broker's commission.

NORTHERN Electric shareholders duly approved the cashback proposals
from the group worth around 500p a share, but doubts remain over how the
shares should now be valued.
Shareholders will receive a payment of 100p a share on September 13
and shortly after will receive either one Preference share for each
Ordinary or cash of 100p if they prefer. Another payment of 50p per
share will be made in February 1997 and by then shareholders should have
received free shares in National Grid.
Northern holds 6.5% of the latter and intends to distribute this among
its own shareholders pro rata according to their holding. The exact
benefit of the full package cannot be determined until the Grid is
floated, but it is widely thought to be about 500p.
This does not mean an easy 500p a share profit for shareholders as the
price of Northern shares will fall. By exactly how much is uncertain and
depends on how the stock market values them.
On the one hand, Northern's dividends will be much higher than those
of its fellow power distributors. On the other, it will be financially
much weaker. It has promised to pay dividends totalling 35.3p in respect
of 1995/96 and to increase subsequent dividends by 7% a year until 2000,
so long as cover is satisfactory, which is an important qualification.
Northern shares were 19p higher at 914p yesterday and if they were
valued at 414p (914p minus 500p) they would be on a prospective yield of
10.6%, which compares with 5% for other electricity shares.
Much of the extra payments will be financed through increased
borrowing, to the extent that gearing will top 200%. So it is obviously
less strong financially than the others though, with virtually
guaranteed cash flows, there is little risk of it getting into trouble
and the rating agencies have recognised this.
However, it will have to have another round of stringent cost-cutting
and will not be able to take the risks involved in building up
non-regulated activities.
The shares will no longer carry any bid premium because no-one is
likely to bid for a debt-burdened utility when there are many others to
choose from. But, equally, they do not merit a yield more than double
the sector average.
One way to value them would be in comparison to gilt yields.
Obviously, Northern is not as secure as HM Government, but it does have
a monopoly over an essential product, selling it at a predetermined
price, so its income is very secure.
A yield of, say, 8% would give a share price of 550p, or #10.50. In
practice a higher risk premium might be demanded, particularly given
political risks, so a price of nearer #10 might be more appropriate.
Either way shareholders stand to benefit.

HER Majesty's Government, God bless them, wish to know our views on
whether there should be a national identity card. Consultation booklets
are available at all HMSOs and local authorities, including the one on
which I serve, will begin to debate the issue this week.
Dear HMG, you may have my answer now.
No.
We are all, I suppose, prisoners of our generation. Mine is that of
the war-time babies, when our parents had to carry such cards and were
constantly warned that careless talk cost lives. Mind you, just across
the Channel in occupied Europe, thousands of Allied spies had seemingly
little trouble at all in acquiring false papers, escaping PoWs were
provided with them regularly by short-sighted forgers and the Jerries
very rarely spotted the join. It was a fool-fool rather than a
fool-proof system.
My contemporaries are also those who came to their formative years
during the Cold War. We saw a thousand films in which poor, down-trodden
people suffering under the communist heel had demands for their papers
to be produced every time they needed to go to a public loo.
More seriously, we saw what happened when brave men and women sought
to challenge the authority of the evil regimes. Thank the Lord, we
chorused, that we live in a free country where no-one has the right to
ask us where we are going or for what reason, unless in very special
circumstances.
Now hang on, says HMG, nobody wants to change all that, we are just
trying to make life easier. To quote from their own booklet: ''Despite a
purse or wallet full of cards, people are often asked to produce
something else to show who they are when they do ordinary things like
paying a bill by cheque, joining a library, hiring goods or buying goods
on credit.''
Forgive me, chaps, but that is rather a contradiction in terms or, to
put it another way, untrue. If I have a purse or wallet full of cards I
will have no difficulty -- nor have had any such experience -- in hiring
a car, joining a video club, or paying by cheque.
The booklet continues with a heading: ''A smart solution''. You will
note the lack of a question mark. This section proclaims: ''Cards may be
just pieces of plastic but, with modern technology, they can store a lot
of information and it's possible for a single card to replace lots of
bulky documents.''
Aye, there's the rub. In exchange for the right to buy a three-piece
suite on HP you will be handing to a finance company details of
everything from your age to credit rating. And those details, bet your
savings on it, will be passed around the houses.
Expect even more unsolicited mail.
Come on, Gov, cut the sweet talk and let's come up front with the real
reason there is talk of identity cards. It is because a lot of folk
think it will cut crime and because the Tory Party conference is in love
with the idea. The first assertion is worth examining.
Presumably if carrying an identity card is to be an effective
deterrent, then not carrying one will have to be an offence. Creating a
new category of crime is unlikely to reduce the overall figures.
Which crimes will the card deter? The booklet suggests credit-card
fraud and illegal immigrants.
But does anyone doubt that there would soon be a black market in
identity cards, that lost ones would be a godsend to the smart criminal?
As for illegal immigrants, these are usually people who have just stayed
on here after entering on their own passports claiming to be ''on
holiday''.
Would there not be a terrible temptation to stop anyone who did not
look ethnically British and demand their papers? And would that not
poison relations between the police and the minority population? I turn
to the police and am happy to record that not all of their number are in
favour of identity cards. The last three Chief Constables of the area in
which I live have been friends of mine and they have divided views on
the issue.
Many policemen know their success in catching criminals, and they are
becoming better and better at it, depends on the support of the
community. Anything which drives a wedge between forces and the public
is to be deplored.
Identity cards in criminal detection are neither new nor smart. They
are old-fashioned technology, overtaken by techniques like DNA testing.
The police do not need them.
The booklet tells me that 11 of the 15 states in the European Union
have identity-card schemes. I suspect, and will check as the debate
progresses, that not all of these are compulsory.
What I do know, for certain, is that the United States of America, a
country with crime and illegal immigration problems vastly more serious
than our own, has always had no truck with the idea. In the Land of the
Free the citizen does not give up his rights lightly.
Nor should we. I utterly reject the argument that ''if you are
innocent, you have nothing to fear from telling the police, or anybody
else, your business''. There are innocent people in jail right now.
Freedom includes a right to conduct your own business in privacy,
provided it harms no-one else. That is one of the freedoms our fathers
and grandfathers fought for in two world wars.
The Prime Minister, I am informed, is in favour of a voluntary
identity card. That is fine by me, as long as I neither have to buy it
nor carry it. And I expect I will still be able to cash the odd cheque.
The booklet invites you to write to the Home Office, F2 Division, Room
310, 50 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1 9AT. This article is on its way,
copy to my MP.

MIND Games, beaten when odds in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal
Ascot, can fly the flag for Jack Berry and northern racing in the Group
1 Nunthorpe Stakes at York today.
The colt, who last year became Berry's first winner at the Royal
meeting when taking the Norfolk Stakes, will have been many people's
idea of champion sprinter at the start of the turf campaign.
A few more would have joined his fan club in the early summer, as Mind
Games boasted an unbeaten record in his first three races of the season.
He could have been expected to take the listed Field Marshal Stakes at
Haydock on his return, but victories in Newmarket's Palace House and the
Temple Stakes at Sandown established him as a contender for top honours.
However, as his trainer commented after the King Stand, it is always
hard for a three-year-old to beat his elders, especially before the
autumn.
Mind Games should find his task slightly easier here and his main
rival looks to be Hever Golf Rose.

BEHIND the apparently disappointing BICC half-time results with
pre-tax profits dropping #3m to #60m, there are one or two sources of
comfort.
One is that the German cables business appears to be past the worst --
it lost #15m in the first half split between trading losses and
reorganisation at KWO. While trading losses will continue there, they
will be at a lower rate helped by an increase in selling prices and
rising exports of low voltage commodity cable to Russia.
There is continuing recovery in the important traditional markets of
Italy and Spain which should continue in what is a late cycle businss.
UK cable activity was considerably helped by the increasing spread of
the fibre optic cable network. That in time should become important in
Continental Europe as a new activity.
But what caused most interest in the City yesterday was the indication
that the Balfour Beatty subsidiary may sell its housebuilding activities
at a time when Tarmac has set its stall out with it also intent on
leaving the sector. Already a couple of approaches have been made to
BICC for the #60m annual turnover business.
Certainly little was expected and came fom Balfour Beatty's UK
construction activities where apart from the Private Finance Initiatives
there was little progress. And even the PFIs cost money, about #2m, in
bidding costs for work which may not materialise until 1997.
Prospects include the Channel Tunnel rail link, light rail and
hospital projects.
A growing proportion of its workload is overseas, totalling 44% of the
#1700m outstanding.
The Barking Reach power station is operational and BICC should benefit
from its 25% stake -- that took seven years to complete with its own
investment amounting to #19m.
Debt has been pushed up through increased working capital requirements
to meet higher raw material costs, particularly copper. But this is
expected to unwind by the year end.
The interim dividend has been reduced 2p to 4p as indicated at the
time of the preliminary figures for last year with a minimum 12.5p total
forecast for a 4.9% yield.
But while pencilling in pre-tax profits for the year about #9m higher
at #140m, the focus of City attention is the initial moves by chief
executive Alan Jones, who arrived from Westland in April, and with
chairman Sir Robin Biggam.
Until something happens, the shares at 320p seem likely to simply mark
time.

SCOTTISH plant hire firm Hewden Stuart, suffering from a downturn in
the construction sector, has diverted #8m of cash earmarked for funding
new equipment to buy three companies in South-east England.
Chairman and chief executive Sandy Findlay said they would fill gaps
in its UK-wide plant hire network.
The biggest acquisition is Gamble and Sadler Crane Hire, which leases
mobile cranes from bases at Littlehampton, Uckfield, and Guildford on
the southern outskirts of London. Hewden Stuart has agreed to purchase
it for #6.3m in cash.
It has also bought JP Summers, a Southampton-based specialist plant
hire firm serving the engineering industry, for #1m.
The third acquisition is the plant hire division of Morgan Sindall,
based at Sawston near Cambridge. It operates mainstream equipment such
as dump trucks, compressors, rollers and mixers, and was purchased for
just under #800,000.
Mr Findlay said Hewden Stuart had decided to go for acquisitions as it
slowed down spending on new plant because of the downturn in the
construction industry and some other areas of the economy.
But he added: ''We would expect the outcome for the full year to be
satisfactory and ahead of last year.''
Its pre-tax profits soared 82% to #34.8m in the year to January 31,
with turnover up 30% at #260m. The shares were unchanged at 158p.

MAMA'S taking us to the zoo tomorrow. Oh no, she's not. She took you
the other day and she's not planning to go again for a long time.
Close encounters with our four-footed friends are a major worldwide
pastime. Around 600 million of us visit a zoo every year. That's one in
10 of the global population. Great day out for maw, paw and the weans
but what about the animals? Great day in?
There are some pretty elaborate justifications for the existence of
zoos. Glasgow Zoo is currently trying to float above its financial
crisis and a long-term decline in the popularity of zoos in general by
announcing a grandiose plan to recast itself as the Glasgow Ark.
Of course, you'll know the theory. Faced with unstoppable pressure on
some of the world's most fragile habitats, zoos, through captive
breeding programmes and gene banks, can guarantee the survival of
certain endangered species.
It's no good prevaricating because the crisis is now, says Richard
O'Grady, Glasgow Zoo's energetic director. Cruelly, he reminds me that
we first discussed this 18 years ago. ''There were 67,000 black rhinos
in the world then. Now there are 1800.''
But captive breeding is only half the story 'cos after the flood Noah
let the animals out again, didn't he? Thus, at some distant future date
when their habitat has been somehow magically restored, captive breeding
populations will restock the so-called ''wild''. This is where the ark
theory springs a leak.
Will Travers is son of Born Free actor Bill Travers and director of
the Born Free Foundation, which campaigns for animals in the wild. He
points out that zoos are very selective about which animals go into the
ark. They tend to be big or cute. And removing them effectively pulls
away a final bulwark against the destruction of their native habitat.
Does anyone seriously believe these animals will ever have a home to go
home to in a century or two?
There are worthy exceptions. The descendants of some of Glasgow's Pere
David deer today graze on the shores of China's Yellow Sea.Others say
education and research in zoos create a reservoir of knowledge from
which the animals benefit, presumably from some sort of trickle-down
effect. But if the standard of information notices in zoos is better
than it was, that's not saying much. Those 600 million zoo visitors each
year could be an enormous engine for change if zoos really were ramming
home the message about habitat loss.Zoos do some valuable research, such
as work at London Zoo on the detection of pregnancy from urine samples.
But most research in zoos is broadly about how to keep animals in zoos.
Understanding a species involves unravelling the symbiotic relationship
with its particular eco-system and other species within it. Zoos are
non-starters here.
The third justification is better because at least it's honest. It's
that zoos are fun. O'Grady is refreshingly straightforward about his
majestic white tigers. They are, he says, ''worthless in conservation
terms'' (because they have been interbred) but the faces of thousands of
visitors light up when they see them.
There's something satisfying about walking past a row of enclosures.
You take some pictures. You mentally tick them off. Seen that. Seen
That. Is there a darker side to such enjoyment? OK, so we don't rule the
world any more and the planet is falling apart but at least animals are
firmly in their place. As you're eyeball to eyeball with a magnificent
snow leopard, you're aware that it's an uneven encounter. It seems to
say: ''Here I am. You put me here. You can come and see me on Saturday
and again on Sunday, if you want.''
Pressure from lobbyists and a TV-viewing public, used to seeing
animals in the wild, has transformed zoos from the sordid peep shows
they once were. Glasgow is following the trend by keeping fewer large
animals, reducing the numbers of species it collects and phasing out
animals which don't appear to thrive in captivity. Kirsty, Glasgow's
last elephant packed her trunk for Chester Zoo and spot of company. And
when the last polar bear died of a tumour on the kidney, the decision
was taken not to replace him.
The ark plan will take this a step further, producing a facility more
like a safari park than a traditional zoo. But less than a quarter of
the planned #20m investment is for the zoo. The rest will go on soft
play areas, a community arena and all sort of fun facilities which every
hard-pressed community could do with. There's even to be an information
centre. With all that, who needs animals?

A LITTLE arithmetic never did anyone any harm. According to the most
recent System Three survey of public opinion, 11% -- count them -- of
Scottish voters are prepared to support Conservative candidates.
Alternatively, 89% wouldn't touch them with forceps and rubber gloves.
These are, or ought to be, astonishing figures. Coming after the most
stunning victory in a leadership election since Tweedledum set about
Tweedledee, and following hard on the heels of Michael Forsyth's charm
offensive (or is that offensive charm?) it speaks of a party less
disliked than despised. Short of an attempt to extend the franchise to
bad-tempered Alsatians from Pilton, the Tories could not be less
popular.
And yet the poll passed, like so many before it, with little more than
routine comment. We have seen this before, so often indeed that it's
hard even to raise a laugh (Political advice for the week: Smile,
Minister -- There Is No Alternative). Such is the condition of Scottish
life no-one even thinks it surprising that the party of government can
manage only fourth place, squeezed out by the party that loves to be
squeezed. The whiff of political body odour is rank; even their best
friends have told them.
Predictably enough, there are people around ready to argue that real
support for the Tories is far higher than polls suggest. It might even
be, ooh, as much as twice what the surveys show. When push comes to
shove, in other words, the rats will return to the ship. The condition
of Scottish Conservatism is not dire, just plain awful.
That said, it might have been imagined the Tories would have learned
just a little humility in their degradation. Far from it: the worse
things get, the more these people stay the same, bumptious when they are
not presumptuous, arrogant when they are not merely asinine. What's
truly amazing -- more so than any complacency over opinion polls -- is
that they are allowed to get away with it.
By any realistic yardstick Scottish Tories no longer matter. Swept
from local government, reduced to nine MPs (several of them sustained by
only a thread), incapable of generating much interest even in their
decay, preserved only by the hocus pocus of a corrupt constitution, they
are a minority party in everything but name, little people in big suits,
the Scottish Office their Potemkin village.
But see how the illusion is maintained. Neither independence nor
devolution can happen, they tell us, if the business community,
habitually defamed by the questionable claim that is wholly Tory, will
not support a change. The blackmail is plain: a tiny minority will vote
with its balance sheets, no matter what the majority wants, so the
majority had better want what it is told to want.
Then there are the media, home, if you believe everything you read, to
a left-wing cabal (prop. I Bell). According to the tale told by the
swarms of Tory commentators whose wisdom is set in balance to the views
of nine-tenths of the population (it would take carbon-dating to
estimate the antiquity of that version of democracy) columnists like
your servant have conspired against Scottish Conservatism by -- stopping
at nothing -- disagreeing with it.
In contrast to the diverse and vibrant English press (prop. R
Murdoch), Scottish papers have been a hotbed of lefties who have
prevented the good news from being heard, or so it is claimed. It is our
fault that voters, who plainly have no minds of their own, have recorded
such unambiguous verdicts. We are enemies of the people, especially when
the people agree with us.
This is tosh, of course. You couldn't fill a taxi-cab with the real
socialists operating in the Scottish press, never mind the sincere
Nationalists. The Tory writers who bitch about the ''chattering
classes'' -- while careful to fill their own quota of chat -- meanwhile
occupy more space than Nationalists or Liberals combined. That is not,
in their black propaganda, enough.
But then, as the old joke has it, in Scottish public life there is
Conservatism and then there is ''politics''. All but extinguished in the
real world, the Tories still thunder in the prints, where everyone who
matters knows what's what, where quality papers must ensure that the
business community, Conservative to a bad suit, gets its daily dose of
balance, and where all views are equal but some are more equal than
others.
A pity, then, about the opinion polls and the election results.
Nuisance that. Shame, too, about reality. Anyone taken in by it might
become convinced that even among the Scots who read quality papers, so
called, a majority -- say two thirds -- long ago found the Tory Party
wanting. That would never do.
After all, should such a conviction be allowed, we might arrive at a
situation in which modern Conservative thinking -- a term looser than a
cannon on the deck of the Daily Express -- is seen for what it is. We
might even grow up enough to notice that the Tories are a fringe party
whose demands for equal rights ought to be answered in the style they
long ago made their own.
Consider: after 16 years Michael Forsyth decides he wants to listen
and no-one even wonders at the nerve (always grant him that) of the man.
Consider, too, the quantities of Tory propaganda daily produced in a
country that has said, until it is tired of saying it, that it isn't
interested. Consider finally how all this comes about.
Equally, ask yourself how it is that in a country in which over half
the population supports Labour there is only one Labour daily paper; how
when a quarter are Nationalists there is only one tabloid claiming to
back the SNP. With those questions answered, it isn't so hard to see why
the mocked and despised Tories live in hope.

THERE are some films which do not add up to a hill of beans and,
superb special effects and stunts apart, Die Hard With a Vengeance, the
third in the series starring Bruce Willis as the New York cop with
attitude, John McClane, is such a movie.
Audiences will enjoy the thrills, leave the cinema entertained -- and
forget it by the time they are home. An effective but oddly mechanical
affair, it has been directed by John McTiernan, who made the first Die
Hard. One would have expected more from McTiernan but, while not a patch
on the first film, it is certainly far better than the second which was
directed by Renny Harlin.
The trouble, as always with sequels, is the plot. One also ends up
feeling, as the stunts get ever more elaborate, that not only have they
thrown in the kitchen sink, but the deep freeze, the gas cooker, and the
fridge as well in order to score. Sequels have to devise a plot which
accommodates certain constants -- McClane, a man who has wife trouble,
fights authority, and is invariably in the wrong place at the wrong
time.
Die Hard had a cracker of a story. McClane, who had gone to visit his
estranged wife in Los Angeles, was trapped in a skyscraper office block
on Christmas Eve after it was taken over by terrorists who were holding
the only other occupants, corporate party-goers including McClane's
wife, hostage.
They were trying to extract a ransom from the authorities, a blind for
actually carrying out a massive robbery. Unaware of the cuckoo in the
nest, who would ultimately frustrate their plans, they went about their
business. The interest was in seeing how McClane exploited the building
to defeat them.
Willis got strong support from the underused, but highly-capable
Bonnie Bedelia as his wife, and Alan Rickman in his first high-camp
villain role as the terrorists' leader. Rickman managed to be both funny
and frightening, Willis bared his muscles impressively, and the result
was a well-deserved hit.
The second Die Hard had a more complicated weaker story-line,
concentrated more on the stunts and, took the character no further.
Part three has great stunts, a run-of-the-mill story-line, and,
although it does all one should expect of an action thriller -- which is
thrill -- it reeks of staleness.
The film opens with an astounding sequence in which Bonwit Teller, the
New York department store, is blown up. The facade shatters, parked cars
are hurled high in the air, and the effect is breathtaking. But there is
more to come, notably a brilliantly contrived and edited crash in the
New York Underground in which a carriage hurtles across the screen,
ploughing over the platform slap into the camera.
As for the plot, McClane is in deep trouble because a gang of
terrorists, led by Jeremy Irons in his first villain role, is out to get
him, a ruse which conceals what they are really up to.
Without characters to hold the interest, no matter how good the
trimmings, any film will pall. Irons -- bleached blonde with a ''Ve Haff
Vays of Making You'' accent and some surprising Princess Di-type muscles
-- makes a passable villain, but lacks the dangerous edge Rickman
brought to a similar role, while the normally reliable Samuel L Jackson
is wasted as McClane's wisecracking, obstinate, unsought buddy, a
shopkeeper, and vital eyewitness collected along the way.
Willis does all that one expects of him, and never breaks as much as a
fingernail, although he gets rather unpleasantly bruised and blooded in
the process. It is a fast-food movie.
There is no denying the power of the performances by Saskia Reeves and
Amanda Plummer in Butterfly Kiss, a bleak and savage tale about madness
and innocence destroyed. The film itself, however, although impressive,
is less than its parts.
Eunice (Plummer), a crazy young woman, seduces Miriam (Reeves), a
slightly retarded girl who works at a motorway filling station, and the
pair set off on an odyssey around the motorways of the north of England.
Eunice is looking for someone called Judith, although whether Judith
is real or merely some figment of her imagination drawn from the legend
of Judith and Holofernes -- which she oddly appears to know all about --
is anybody's guess. She is homicidal and kills women -- filling-station
cashiers, motorway restaurant waitresses -- who catch her eye and then
turn out not to be the lost beloved Judith. Miriam, obsessed with her
new friend, is swept along on Eunice's mad venture until she too kills.
The film is consistently intriguing -- entertaining is not the word --
and occasionally strong meat because Eunice, who is into bondage or more
accurately self-chastisement, is festooned in chains and nipple clamps.
Not a pretty sight. Most of the killings take place off screen, but
there is some raunchy sex when she seduces Miriam and then the men who
also become her victims. It may give offence.
Although by no means erotic to watch, Butterfly Kiss, directed by
Michael Winterbottom with genuine flair, is highly disturbing. Outrage
would be the wrong response to this story of lesbian love because
Butterfly Kiss is never prurient, never simply an exercise in
sado-masochistic pornography. Given the salacious material, it could so
easily have been the latter.
Winterbottom shows why care in the community is so dangerous since it
allows people like Eunice to roam free. Plummer as Eunice exudes the
most amazing aura of danger, sudden rages and equally sudden bursts of
near hypnotic charm.
Reeves -- photographed to look plain, a pity because she is a very
attractive actress -- makes poor, lost, down-trodden Miriam, an ugly
duckling forever trying to see the good in people, extremely
sympathetic. The dreary plastic and concrete world of fast food and
motorways has been finely photographed by Seamus McGarvey.

DUNEDIN Japan Investment Trust took a nose-dive in the year to June
30, weighed down by its portfolio of under-performing small companies
and the cost of hedging against a fall in the strong yen.
But the #15.9m trust managed by Dunedin Fund Managers in Edinburgh has
staged a recovery since then as the yen has weakened dramatically and
Japanese share prices have picked up.
Net asset value plunged 25.0% to 78.4p during the year to June,
overshooting a sterling-adjusted decline of 19.4% in the Tokyo stock
exchange index.
Earnings per share fell by 0.12p after a 0.07p rise in 1993/94, and
for the second year running the trust failed to pay a dividend.
But fund manager Nigel Barry said the net asset value had rebounded
10% over the last six weeks, out-pacing a 7.5% recovery in the Tokyo
index as the trust's currency hedging finally paid off.
''I think we have broken out,'' he said, as the yen dipped briefly to
99 per dollar after hitting a high of 79 in April.

A RATTLING good read is the Scottish Financial Enterprise Directory
1995/96. No, not the financial reports and unit trust listings but the
section, Who's Who in Scottish Finance, in which our captains of
industry and commerce list their hobbies.
John Frame of Bell Lawrie, White &amp; Co lists ''watching the 1990 Grand
Slam video''. Robert McDougall Glennie, managing partner of lawyers
McGrigor Donald enjoys tropical fruit farming. Mary Campbell of Noble &amp;
Co likes nothing better than ''working with wool''.
Taking it all a bit seriously, Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman of Stakis
among other jobs, includes ''work'' among his hobbies. Economics
journalist Robert Stokes, whiles away his time soul-searching, while
Gianni Manca, an Italian lawyer with Scottish connections, likes a bit
of invective.
George Gwilt, of the Scottish Mortgage Trust, admits to flute-playing.
Angus McDonald, the chairman of Caledonian Bank, lists ''fiddling
(mainly musical)''. A man of simple tastes is John Ambrose, a partner in
Price Waterhouse, whose recreation is ''eating fish and chips''.
Driving a bargain
THE Car Number Game: Accountants Kidson Impey, trying to realise the
assets of a Scottish firm which has recently gone belly up trying to
sell sanding machines to the Middle East, are offering for sale the
cherished plate from the company car. It is RFC7, which they feel may
have some value since Rangers FC recently clocked up their seventh
successive Scottish league title.
Also on the football number front, an advert in the Sunday papers
offers the plates HIB1, HIB2, and HIB3 as a package for #20,000. Or, for
a bit more, you could buy the club itself.
Spanish practices
HERE at The Diary, we try to avoid making fun of foreigners what can't
write good English. But here goes.
John Dick of Balloch passes on a leaflet handed out by workers in
dispute at Port Aventura, a Disney-style complex in northern Spain. In
an attempt to raise public awareness of their plight, they wrote:
''Citizens and workers of another countries that you are nowadays on
the city and villages of Tarragona: From Sunday, August 6th, the
employers of Port Aventura are going to come out on undefinilyty strike
until the company get negotiations and concede us some minim and digne
working and economic conditions.
''Actually, the work conditions are improper and typically of the
third world. Now Catalonia and the rest of Spanish state is used as
prove camp for a policy to go down the rights and work conditions in all
the world (as you can see everyday on the newspapers).
''The progress, the scientific and technical advances shall serve us
to reach a better level at work and daylife.
''We're sure you'll understand us.'' Almost.
To cap it all
FOR the yachtsperson who has everything, from the Sailor's Society
charity Christmas catalogue -- a ''Captain Bob hat'' as worn by Robert
Maxwell aboard the Lady Ghislaine. A snip at #3.95. Bon voyage but check
your pension before you sail off.
Egging them on
WE have had an influx of communications (two, actually) on the subject
of Kinder Eggs. Related items have came our way this week.
For those of you unfamiliar with this product, a Kinder Egg is a piece
of confectionery of Dutch origin. It consists of a chocolate egg
containing one of a range of small toys. (Remember, children, the small
toys are not meant to be eaten.)
The first Kinder Egg brought to our attention contained a leaflet
portraying a range of ''Frosty Froggies'', a band of cute frogs who
live, inexplicably, in the Alps, spending their time ski-ing and
building snowmen. They have catchy names such as Johnny Snowball and
Jack Speedskier.
We feel Glaswegians might appreciate the character called Jimmi Piste.
The second Kinder Egg offered a set of model soldiers from the Asiatic
wars of many centuries ago. They were labelled respectively Hun 1, Hun
2, Hun 3 and Hun 4. As the sender Euan Simpson of East Kilbride pointed
out, some of the wee soldiers came fully equipped with swords and
shields.
Who's sorry now?
AS the Japanese finally say sorry for their behaviour during the
Second World War, the Diary is still looking for apologies from the
following:
Jeffrey Archer for his books.
Sydney Devine for his albums and many concerts at the Pavilion.
The Scottish 1974 World Cup sqaud for a song with the words ''Yabba
dabba doo, we support the boys in blue and it's easy, easy''.
Glasgow planning department for allowing the construction of that big
pink office building at Charing Cross.
Michael Forsyth's parents. What do you mean what for?
The Duke of Cumberland for the atrocities after Culloden.
Jimmy Hill for being Jimmy Hill.
Edinburgh for never giving visitors their tea.
Glasgow for keeping people in stitches.
Japan for the poor quality of their apologies.
We are sure you have ideas of your own in this vein. Send your
apologies to the Diary at the usual address. We apologise for the fact
that the prize for the best apology will be the usual old bottle of
whisky.

CLARE HENRY'S article on the Bilbao 2000 Architecture and Regeneration
exhibition, currently on show at Princes Square, Glasgow, highlighted
both a wonderful exhibition and a city which has a seemingly absolute
commitment to quality of environment with all involved pulling together
with one objective: to make their city one of the great European cities
in the new millennium.
One need only to look at the architectural models and talent on
display to grasp that commitment. As an architect working in Glasgow,
the exhibition was, for me, both inspiring and enlightening. The people
of Bilbao, a city of comparable size and population to Glasgow, have in
place a plan for regeneration which is primarily driven by architectural
quality and a sense that their city deserves the best whatever the cost.
Unfortunately, I could not help but compare their extremely elegant
pedestrian river crossing with ours or work currently being undertaken
at Glasgow Airport with the superb Calatrava proposal, which would be a
joy to fly into, or their plans for an integrated transport system which
will be housed within a stunning modern building by a British architect.
Absent from the exhibition was any half-hearted refurbishment or
''design and build'' proposal or oceans of tarmac; even though the
Basques are equally as proud of their heritage and the investment
strategy is 60% funded by the private sector. In Bilbao where there is
vision and a will there is a way. The heritage lobby, trustees of the
National Gallery, and GDA please take note.
Clare Henry threw down the gauntlet by saying ''Over to you,
Glasgow''. Well Glasgow's architects have at least begun to put a
strategy together for the Year of Architecture and Design and beyond.
The Glasgow Institute of Architects has recognised that the success of
1999 and a vision of Glasgow as a truly great European city depends on
lessons which can be learned from cities like Bilbao: aim high, strive
for quality in everything, and allow no half measures.
The institute has begun two important initiatives. The first is to
capitalise on the potential of the Clyde as a major, but seemingly
ignored, contributor to future regeneration and has begun plans for an
international conference and workshop, involving interested architects
from the city and beyond and both schools of architecture. The second,
is to form a steering group which will look specifically at the Year of
Architecture and Design.
As chairman of that group, I can assure Clare Henry that we will be,
like the people of Bilbao, endeavouring to promote modern architecture
and the quality of the built environment as an incontestable component
in any city's vision for the future and the under-utilised talent of
many of Glasgow's own architects.

When Concorde took to the skies it shattered records and eardrums --
then had its wings clipped. Soon it will fly into history, writes Kirsty
Scott.
WHEN the Concorde project was first mooted in the 1950s, the future of
the aviation industry looked supersonic all the way. Forty years on,
that vision has shrunk to a small fleet of sleek but ageing aircraft
ferrying the powerful and privileged to America, or staging stunts like
yesterday's round-the-world jaunt.
There are 12 Concordes in service at present, five with Air France and
seven with British Airways, but they are expected to come to the end of
their service life between the year 2005 and 2010 and there is, as yet,
nothing to replace them.
Various groups and consortia are working on designs for a new breed of
supersonic aircraft but they are all coming up against the problem which
helped scupper the Concorde dream -- the ear-crunching, ground-shaking
sonic boom.
''There are projects in the pipeline but they have not progressed
sufficiently to ensure that once Concorde ends its service life there
will be another aircraft ready to take its place,'' said Gunter Endres,
air transport expert with Flight Magazine.
''But the problem that faces all of them is the sonic boom. Concorde
effectively is allowed to fly supersonic over water and not over land.
Unless the supersonic boom is solved future operations will be limited.
''The boom is terribly noisy. It creates a lot of vibration. The
problem is technical and there are various things being considered to
reduce the effect of the boom, but there is no real answer yet.''
The groups investigating the supersonic concept in some form include a
British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, and Deutsche Aerospace consortium which
is working on the European Supersonic Research Programme. The project
will address key technical issues such as materials, aerodynamics and
systems. The basis for the examination is a plane with a range of
10,000km, room for 250 passengers, and a speed of Mach 2. Boeing,
McDonnell-Douglas and a Japanese concern are also looking at the idea,
and American aero engineers are working on plans for a hypersonic
passenger plane which will fly at five times the speed of sound.
If the sonic boom problem is cracked and a new supersonic aircraft
goes into production, it is highly unlikely that it will look anything
like Concorde, with its slim lines and distinctive narrow nose.
''I think we're now looking at a big aircraft travelling at about the
same speed as Concorde but carrying between 250 and 300 passengers,''
said Endres.
At British Aerospace, spokeswoman Karen Mitchell said they were
exploring the technology concerned, but had no plans for development. To
be cost-effective, she added, any project would have to be developed
under wide international co-operation.
Money has always been a sore point for the Concorde project. It has
been dubbed the most expensive marketing experiment in history and it
has created the phrase ''Concorde fallacy'' -- the term given to the
belief that it is a waste of money to pull the plug on a project once
you have invested a lot of money in it. Huge sums of public money were
swallowed up by Concorde after it had become clear that it was not
viable.
The British/French project was launched in 1962 and development took
seven years and cost #1.5 billion. There were predictions that 400
aircraft would be built, but only 20 were ever constructed and only 16
were production aircraft.
On April 9, 1969, Concorde 002 took off from a runway near Bristol on
her maiden flight from Britain, a couple of weeks after her French
counterpart. The aircraft made its first commercial flight in 1976 when
two aircraft took off simultaneously from London and Paris. Hopes of
expanding the service into the lucrative US market failed when a lawyer
hired to win landing rights admitted: ''Concorde is noisy as hell.''
Last year, British Airways scrapped its Concorde service on the London
to Washington route after 18 years to divert its resources into the more
lucrative American holiday charter market. The airline's London to New
York service remains the flagship run and is generally 70% full. Almost
three-quarters of the passengers are regular business travellers.
Despite the problems which have dogged it, there are few who will not
feel some sense of sadness when the final Concorde bows out of service
early next century. If there is indeed nothing to replace it at that
time, our vision of supersonic travel will shrink further to a memory of
a sleek shape slicing through the sky at twice the speed of sound.

IBM is setting up a multi-lingual helpline centre for computer users
throughout Europe at its Greenock manufacturing plant.
The move, to be officially announced in September, will create about
200 jobs.
The helpline centre will offer telephone help to IBM computer users
throughout Western Europe in languages ranging from Finnish to Spanish.
Computer users with a problem will simply dial a local number within
their own country and be patched through to Greenock, where a computer
specialist will answer in their own language.
The multi-lingual helpline service will be tacked on to IBM's existing
call centre for the UK and Ireland, which already employs about 120
English speakers at Greenock.
With the creation of a single helpline service for the whole of
Europe, IBM will do away with several existing call centres in
individual countries.
The US-based computer firm hopes to recruit most of the foreign
language staff for the Greenock centre locally, but is having some
problems finding Dutch speakers.
IBM's huge factory in Greenock, which even has its own train station,
currently employs 3000 people. It is the company's main production
centre for Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
Glasgow is trying to promote itself as a growth area for telephone
call centres and held a one-day conference last month to attract more
investors.
According to John McCann of Glasgow Development Agency's Business
Location Service, up to 4000 people already work at telephone call
centres in and around Glasgow, mainly in the financial sector.
Major employers include Direct Line, the telephone insurance
subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, British Airways, which
operates a regional reservations centre in Glasgow and TSB, which sells
mortgages by phone from the city.
Only one company currently operates a multi-lingual call centre in
Scotland similar to the one that IBM is setting up.
That is McQueen, a software services company, which has 200 telephone
counsellors, speaking fluent French, German, Spanish, Dutch, and Swedish
as well as English, at its Edinburgh headquarters.

DIANE Ladd does not mince her words, nor did she on this occasion.
''You were a shitty husband, but you're a great actor and I have the
perfect part for you,'' she said. Her ex-husband, Bruce Dern, was
sceptical, muttering to their daughter, the actress, Laura Dern, that
her mother had come up with ''some script or other''.
Ladd sent him the screenplay she had written for Mrs Munck, and said,
when Dern called to say he would do the part, the respect in his voice
was awesome. He promised to do his best for her, saying that together
they had the chance to do ''something really different and wonderful''.
The three time Oscar nominee -- Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More,
Rambling Rose and Wild at Heart -- insisted there was nothing
autobiographical in her film, based on a novel by Ella Leffland, about a
couple who once had an affair and now feud bitterly in old age. It was
not about her marriage and she did not write the role of Patrick Leary
with Dern in mind, she said.
Ladd has worked with some of the best in Hollywood -- Nicholson,
Duvall, De Niro -- any of whom could have played Leary, a wealthy
70-year-old cripple who comes to live with his stepson's widow, Mrs
Munck, played by Ladd, to find he is the fly, she the spider.
She decided that she and Dern had acted well together in the past and
she wanted someone who could play Leary both as a decrepit old man and
in the flashbacks as the upstanding 42-year-old seducer of the innocent
farm girl Mrs Munck once was. The role also demanded a fine dramatic
actor who could be funny -- it is a black comedy -- and Dern fitted the
bill.
At 58 he was perfect to be both old enough and young enough.
Ladd, petite, blonde and very pretty, talks nineteen-to-the-dozen. She
is bursting over with enthusiasm for her film, and no wonder, having
waited 23 years for the chance to make it. Leffland's book came to her
attention in 1976, but the project never got off the ground. It was not
until three years ago that the chance to option it arose again. She
found a writer and a producer, but there were differences between them
and the writer fled to another job.
Faced with the project likely to trickle like sand through her fingers
again she sat down and wrote the first draft of the script in three
weeks, found new backers, Barbara Boyle and Michael Taylor, and filming
started in Toronto in August 1994.
She has always been a writer, but kept it quiet, having been warned by
her actress friends Shelley Winters, who appears in the film, and Lee
Grant that she would never work again once it was found out she also
wrote. Actresses had to be actresses, to be pigeonholed, not be unknown
quantities.
People -- men -- were afraid of actresses who could write. While she
was at the Actors Studio she put on a play she had written and Lee
Strasberg had asked who had written it. ''A man,'' she said. ''He is at
Harvard.'' Strasberg was satisfied and they did the piece, which she
still has in her trunk.
''Mrs Munck appealed to me because it is not a story about violence --
there are no guns, no police, no courtroom scenes,'' she said. ''It is
about human relationships, about a feud between a man and a woman, about
how love can turn to hatred and how the two people concerned realise
that they are both to blame for what has happened to them.''
Warmly received at the Seattle Film festival earlier this year, Mrs
Munck has already been sold for distribution in Europe. Its fate here
could depend on how Edinburgh, where it is premiered tomorrow, reacts.
As far as the US is concerned, she has an option on the theatrical
rights and will be taking it round this autumn's big film festivals in
Toronto, Montreal in the hope of finding a distributor.
If that works, the film could point to a new direction for independent
film-makers to find finance through television because the independent
sector in the US is getting smaller all the time.
''It provoked a powerful audience response at Seattle and I received
hundreds of letters, mostly from women, who recognised in their own
lives the situation in which Mrs Munck finds herself,'' she said. She
admitted to finding it hard work being writer, director and star, but it
was one way to get the film made. She could afford herself, and by not
taking her usual salary could pay everyone else their normal money.
She wants to direct again and to make pictures about people, not
special effects. Mrs Munck was Harold and Maude meet Misery, she said.
True, but there is a lot of George and Martha in there too and Albee is
patently an influence on her writing.
Currently in Britain filming Dennis Potter's last play for the BBC,
opposite Albert Finney, she hinted that the great man had communicated
from beyond the grave with cast and director, Kenneth Trodd, but refused
to elaborate. Things had happened and the result could be amazing, she
said.
Ladd, who is to discuss her roles in David Lynch's Wild at Heart and
also in Rambling Rose in the Scene by Scene section of the Festival, is
enthusiastic about the opportunity Edinburgh provides to promote Mrs
Munck.
She knows nobody in Scotland and said I could sit next to her at the
premiere and hold her hand. I hope she remembers to ask.

Benedict Brogan is in at the birth of a new think-tank by the Prime
Minister's rival in the Tory leadership election, and discerns an
uncanny parallel with Thatcher's rise.
IF JOHN Redwood has taken a holiday so far this summer then few have
noticed. Since that day in July when the Parliamentary Conservative
Party voted to reject the former Welsh Secretary and endorse John Major
as leader, he has been a near-constant presence on our screens and in
our newspapers. His campaign to lead the Tories back to the land of the
Thatcherite right continues.
Yesterday he was in London to introduce his latest creation, the
Conservative 2000 Foundation, a think-tank designed first and foremost
to develop the policies he set out during his unsuccessful bid to unseat
Major. Its other objectives, apparently secondary, are to help the
Tories win the debate for ideas into the next millennium, and -- in
third place only -- to help the Conservatives win the next General
Election.
The sense of deja-vu at the launch was picked up by Hywel Williams,
Redwood's political adviser and the foundation's director. He opened by
suggesting it seemed like old times, a reference to Redwood's campaign
press conferences.
The difference is in the combination of historical precedent and the
legacy of the leadership contest. In 1974 Margaret Thatcher set up the
Centre for Policy Studies to develop the embryonic ideas that 20 years
later have transformed the country; a year later she had toppled Edward
Heath.
This year Redwood persuaded a full third of Tory MPs to back his
candidacy or withhold their support from John Major, an encouraging
result for an unlikely candidate without an obvious base of support. Can
he expect to repeat the Iron Lady's achievement?
The foundation and its founder believe their brand of right-wing
populism is what Britain is craving. A shift to the right, with tax
cuts, spending cuts, tough action against welfare cheats, a new royal
yacht, less Europe, a strong dose of moral fibre, are part of the
Redwood package.
Among his targets are Labour and Liberal Democrat proposals for
constitutional reforms, including a devolved, tax-raising parliament for
Scotland.
Writing in the Times, he describes Opposition plans for devolution as
alarming: ''These would make us heavily over-governed, over-burden us
with taxation, and put us in hock to politicians and bureaucrats. These
plans would shatter the Kingdom.''
However, those who see in this a repackaging of traditional Tory
centralism should examine closely his thoughts on quangos, another of
his favourite targets. Earlier this week he described the way quangos
have come to dominate public life, soaking up public funds but avoiding
public accountability. He wants those that are useless abolished
outright. Others, he says, should have their powers transferred to local
government.
Conservative 2000's first publication is its suggested answers to the
75 questions on Tory policy being sent out to Conservative Associations
around the country as part of the Prime Minister's promised consultation
exercise on Our Nation's Future.
Under separate headings -- Enterprise and Prosperity, Law and Order, A
Sovereign Nation -- proposed by Tory Central Office, constituencies will
be asked to consider a series of measures based on cuts in spending and
taxes. Redwood repeats his campaign proposal to lop #5000m off
Government expenditure -- about 1.7% of the total -- at a stroke to fund
pre-election tax cuts.
To the question: ''Who should benefit from tax cuts?'' Redwood
replies, ''Tax cuts should be given to those families that make
sacrifices to support themselves, especially those with mortgages, and
prudent pensioners who have borne the burden of many of the tax
increases in the last two years'' -- a sentiment aimed directly at the
middle classes currently being wooed by Tony Blair's New Labour.
As for ''giving crime victims a better deal'', Redwood says: ''We have
to deal firmly with criminals. We should not blame the victims of
burglary for failure to buy a better lock. We should give support to
people who try to defend themselves and property rather than treating
them as criminals themselves''.
And on the constitution, he asserts the primacy of Britishness: ''If
you come to live here or if you are born here you are British. You
should be encouraged to be proud of that. Implying there is something
wrong with the United Kingdom Crown and Parliament undermines this
feeling.''
However, he says: ''Devolution on Labour's lines is not our issue. We
need to demonstrate that it is a phoney solution to the problem that
people feel there is too much Government and that too much power is
being centralised.
''The Conservative answer to this is to give greater freedoms to
individuals, families, companies, and independent institutions.''
Redwood came from nowhere to challenge Major when the Prime Minister
unexpectedly decided to take on his growing army of critics. He has
worked assiduously to improve his profile with fellow MPs.
And he has tried to change the image of the cold, calculating Vulcan:
he smiles a lot, though often inappropriately, and has tried to inject
some passion into his speech pattern. If his candidacy came as a shock,
it earned him credit for his bravery and some of his ideas.
The challenge has been to consolidate this achievement, and the
think-tank was a logical step. With less than two years to the General
Election, the forcing houses for ideas crowding Westminster will gain
influence as Government looks to beef up its manifesto. Redwood knows
about the process. He worked in, and headed, the Downing Street Policy
Unit in the mid-eighties under Margaret Thatcher, where he advised
against the poll tax.
He may be a right-winger, but as his policies suggest, he has a keen
sense of what can and cannot sell to traditional Tory supporters. One
Cabinet colleague described him earlier this year as ''the only (former)
Cabinet Minister who understands the public loathing of the Tories''.
Right-wing newspapers congratulate him for his populism and his
courage in asking difficult questions. He is praised in particular for
avoiding the pitfall of becoming a one or two-issue politician, like so
many on the disgruntled right who are obsessed with Europe, and little
else. He has shown a willingness to address the more explosive issues
which the Government has so far been reluctant to tackle: personal
morality, civic behaviour, and the family.
He has also attracted the admiration, and in many cases the support,
of a number of influential young intellectuals on the Thatcherite right.
Andrew Roberts, the historian and author of Eminent Churchillians was
involved in his campaign and was on hand for yesterday's launch. He once
tellingly described Redwood as ''Lady Thatcher on speed''. Niall
Ferguson, the Cambridge historian, is equally complimentary, as is
Norman Stone, Professor of Modern History at Oxford. They will be among
the regulars at the lunches and seminars the foundation promises will
serve as proving ground for its ideas.
His fans on the right include Lady Thatcher herself, who made
approving noises during the leadership contest. This project is a way of
consolidating that support and confirming that contrary to the
expectations of only months ago, Redwood and not Defence Secretary
Michael Portillo is now the standard bearer of Thatcherism.
Redwood may assure us that the Conservative 2000 Foundation is an
''open house, rooted in and working for'' the Conservative Party. But
we, and John Major, know it is clearly his house, rooted in and working
for John Redwood.

THE 1995 report of the Nurses and Midwives Pay Review Body recommended
that nurses' pay should be increased by 1% and that nurses could
negotiate with their employers to achieve more. The immediate response
of the Royal College of Nursing was to reject the report and launch a
campaign for all nurses to get a guaranteed 3% increase with no strings
attached.
The review body has determined nurses' pay since 1984. Each year the
RCN submits evidence relating to pay on behalf of our members -- the
majority of qualified nurses in the UK. We cannot undo this year's
report which contained recommendations that neither NHS managers nor
staff requested. We are, in fact, about to submit evidence for next
year.
Make no mistake, the RCN will be arguing that in seeking to implement
local pay this year the Government made a serious error. The pay review
body cannot have failed to miss the confusion and distress that this
year's report caused to nurses, NHS managers, and the public.
Many trusts have now offered 3%, and many of the strings have been
removed. By establishing that 3% is the going rate for nurses, we have
side-stepped the initial drive towards local pay and we are well placed
to win the argument if it is tried next year.
Some employers have resorted to desperate measures, making a
unilateral decision to put what they think the nurses are worth into the
pay packet without agreement. We are advising nurses how to reject this.
With the support of the public, we will not stop our campaign until all
nurses have received a fair pay award for 1995 and the future.

Scottish Board Secretary,

NO-ONE will ever make a peak-time TV programme about the chiropodist
who gives little old ladies of 80 the comfort to walk to the bingo. Such
mundane treatments are not appealing, they have no blue-light drama and
no high-cost demands to tug at the heartstrings, yet loss of mobility
and thus independence is one of the major causes of the loneliness and
isolation of the elderly. Ten pounds buys a month of comfort and
companionship.
Doctors and nurses in hospital wear nice white uniforms and do
exciting scientific things. Arthur Clarke said that to a primitive
people advanced technology was indivisible from magic. Community care
has no such glamour, it is invisible to most. Teams of highly skilled
professionals enter people's homes without drama, but on a daily, weekly
or monthly basis, often for years.
Social workers who have to live in a political minefield unobtrusively
form the cement that holds disparate services together. Only district
nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists usually wear
uniforms (that's how the patients like it) and so the invisible staff
carry out millions of treatments and visits in a year, bringing care to
people as locally as possible.
The breadth of community care and the depth of effort are usually
ignored unless there can be opportunities for posturing. The philosophy
has been portrayed as an attempt to cut the cost of the welfare state
when even a superficial glance will reveal that it can be up to twice as
expensive to care for some patients in their own homes.
The apparent realities are those that create headlines or
documentaries and thus public opinion. Community care has come to mean
care of the mentally handicapped and mentally ill. Those who were
formerly kept secluded and excluded but now live as our neighbours.
In this coming year the NHS in Scotland will put Mental Health
Services into the same priority category as cardiovascular disease.
This, coupled with the emphasis on primary care, should enable community
trusts, social work departments and the voluntary agencies to make the
philosophy of community care a reality by outlining a national strategy
with local applications.
Mental ill-health is the high-profile part of community care and as
such commands headlines at times of tragedy. While at any one time up to
20% of the adult population may show signs of mental illness, there is a
general unease with the notion that some people can suffer cruelly
incapacitating conditions for which medicine has as yet no cure, and
often no accurate diagnosis. There is stigma attached to those who
demonstrate less than perfect intellects and social controls. Society
wishes its lunatics safely shut away.
The philosophy of caring for people with a mental illness, within
their family or community, has a very respectable pedigree. England and
Wales came to it 20 years after mainland Europe, North America and
Australia, but adopted and adapted the model first proposed and
implemented by Stein and Test from the University of Wisconsin Medical
School. Scotland has been slower still to close the Victorian hospitals,
but in many ways this habit of ca' canny has enabled careful
consideration of the programmes being implemented in the health board
and local government areas. Dogma is the inflexible relation of
philosophy, and if care is not taken, the very aims of these programmes
could be destroyed.
In the drive to take people out of the dark, soul-destroying
environments of the institutions portrayed by Goffman, there was a truly
admirable wish to give people the dignity and freedom we all have a
right to expect.
What is forgotten is that many thousands of these people were not
mentally ill, nor mentally handicapped. The forgotten and hidden had
often committed only some minor social misdemeanour, perhaps just the
high jinks of youthful flirtation, or, the now normal, adolescent
rebellion. Some were simply homosexual. Some were discarded wives or
inconvenient children. The fashions of psychiatry are as liable as any
other to social interpretation, and in a society where the richest
children the world has ever known voluntarily starve themselves to death
we should not judge the past too harshly.
The danger is in going too far and letting the dogma destroy that
philosophy of individual dignity. Some people will always need care, and
while they should no longer be expected to put up with conditions of
communal living that would horrify anyone outwith a third-rate public
school, they should not be condemned to isolation and loneliness within
a society which shuns their company.
Nor let there be any pretence that all families should care for a
mentally ill relative. Removal from the family may be the first
necessary step in treatment. Hospitals, and indeed the NHS, are not the
only solution to acute or recurring chronic illness, but one man's
institution is another's established community.
There is a need for places of asylum. Sanctuaries for the mentally ill
where occupation can be meaningful, support from professionals available
round the clock, and people can reach and maintain their optimum
potential for living. The mentally ill often live in fear, a fear which
rarely results in the death of a stranger but too often in suicide.
There is a need to face the fact that for many there is no cure, that
for some the treatment prescribed is worse than the illness, and that
containment within a safe but decent environment is the only humane
lifestyle. Prison should not be the eventual destination of the mentally
ill, there can be too much tragedy on the journey.
From the philosophy of Care in the Community both for general and
mental health purposes each health board and social work department has
set up joint consultation and planning groups, these are implementing
local strategies, and for most community support this is the ideal.
For the severely or chronically mentally ill, however, there needs to
be some re-assessment on a national scale. A Scottish strategy should
make some provision for secure units, perhaps four are needed, which
would care for those very few who cannot and should not be expected to
live in the cities, towns or villages. This would not only protect the
vulnerable mentally ill, it would enable psychiatrists to direct
patients to suitable care before tragedy or criminality intervened.
It is important to remember that mental health care is less than half
the picture of care in the community, and of that part, the severely ill
are a small fraction. For most people their care when mentally ill
begins and ends in the surgery of their own general practitioner, or
with the visits of the community psychiatric nurse or psychologist. For
most there will be long periods of good health, for some only one
isolated episode of illness.
But communities, too, need to regain the tolerance that once found
space for those who were different. For the laddie who has a way with
plants or animals but cannot dress himself, or the mentally handicapped
child or adult who gives affection even to strangers, but whose table
manners are noisily exuberant. Acceptance of intellectual difference is
as important as racial or religious diversity in a mature society.
Care in the Community is not a cheap alternative to hospital care, it
is the method that advanced societies have chosen in order to give
dignity and freedom to the physically and mentally frail who can
benefit. It is not a perfect system. It can meet needs but not demands,
and in its millions of daily interventions will sometimes fall short of
the ideal. It depends on the skills of autonomous professionals of many
disciplines. There is no glamour, but there is a lot of very real
quality of life.

Care NHS Trust.

Yesterday, however, Mr Bob Morrison, CalMac's deputy manager in
Stornoway, said: ''The Western Isles Islands Council is dead against any
expansion of the service to seven days. The same goes for the local

A BOOK by former SAS sergeant and best-selling author Andy McNab will
not be published until a legal challenge by the Ministry of Defence has
been heard.
At a High Court hearing in London yesterday, McNab and Transworld
Publishers, owners of Bantam Press, gave a worldwide undertaking not to
publish the book, Immediate Action, until further court order.
The MoD's move for a permanent gag on the book, in which it will
allege breach of confidentiality and copyright, is expected to be heard
in the autumn. Two weeks ago, the MoD obtained an emergency injunction.
The book is a follow-up to McNab's best-seller, Bravo Two Zero, an
account of SAS activities behind Iraqi lines during the Gulf War in
which he and other members of a patrol were captured and tortured.
Numerous books about the SAS have been written by former members over
the past few years but the bid to muzzle McNab's new work about the
regiment is the first time that the MoD has taken action. The
proceedings are seen as a test case.
The MoD says the only reason for its court action is to avoid damage
to national security and future operations, and to protect the lives of
serving personnel.
At yesterday's brief hearing, held in camera, Mr Justice Evans-Lombe
set a timetable for exchange of written evidence between the two sides
in preparation for the full hearing.

A NEW ferry service between Argyll and Northern Ireland is unlikely to
start as planned next year, according to the main agency behind the
project, Argyll's local enterprise company.
The news met with disappointment in Argyll.
The local enterprise company says a number of factors are still
unresolved -- not least the fact it was now unlikely a terminal would be
ready for use at the Irish port of Ballycastle, County Antrim, in time
for the projected start-date of spring next year.
The enterprise company's depute chief executive, Mr Ken Abernethy,
said that while hopes of next year had receded, the position still
looked good for a start the following year.
''I'm sure we will be able to resolve the outstanding difficulties
within that period,'' he said.
The #7m project, which would establish a ferry service between
Campbeltown in Kintyre and Ballycastle, is expected to create hundreds
of jobs and inject millions of pounds -- mostly tourism revenue -- into
the West Highland economy.
So keenly was the development awaited that, recently, Argyll's main
tourist board sent its tourist officer to Ireland to survey potential
markets.
The secretary of Kintrye marketing group, Mr Bruce Urquhart, said he
could understand why the local enterprise company was apprehensive of
pressing ahead until it was confident of success but said he was still
very disappointed.
''I think a lot of the local businesses had their fingers crossed. A
lot of people in Campbeltown and Kintyre are just hanging on by the skin
of their teeth financially and the ferry was going to be their
salvation.''

A JURY is to hear evidence in a #50,000 claim by Scottish Football
Association chief executive Jim Farry, who is suing the publishers of
the Sun over a story which accused him of being a ''dictator''.
The legal action by Mr Farry followed an article in the newspaper
which stated that he had ordered Celtic to drop one of Scottish soccer's
best-loved characters, veteran physiotherapist Jimmy Steele, from their
dugout team.
Mr Farry claims that the ''malicious'' article lowered his reputation
in the eyes of society and that the Sun had refused to apologise and pay
a sum of money to a charity or organisation of his choice.
In a preliminary debate in the case at the Court of Session, Lord
Osborne was told that, during the 1993/94 season, the SFA had
discussions about who should be allowed to sit in the dugout or
''technical area'' at matches.
It was agreed that the number should be restricted to eight per club,
a decision relayed to clubs in January 1994.
It was left to each club to decide who should occupy the dugout as
long as each person had a ''specific and intrinsic function to fulfil''.
After a Motherwell v Celtic match on January 29, 1994, Mr Farry wrote
to Celtic pointing out that Jimmy Steele, 78, had been named in the form
handed to the match referee as a person who would be in the technical
area.
The form had described Mr Steele as a ''retired physio'', and Mr Farry
stated in his letter: ''It would seem that he did not have a working
role at the match,'' adding that Mr Steele's presence in the technical
area was contrary to the terms of the SFA's decision.
The letter added: 'I would therefore request that you ensure that your
club complies at all times in future with the terms of the association's
instructions.''
In the Sun story the following month, former Celtic player and Lisbon
Lion Tommy Gemmell was quoted as saying: ''Farry is going down the same
road as his predecessors. He wants to be a dictator.
''For anyone to have the temerity to insult the man (Mr Steele) in
this manner after the services he has given to Celtic and Scottish
football over the years is an absolute disgrace.''
Mr Farry denies that he is a dictator or that his letter was an insult
to Mr Steele, who acted for 35 years as an unpaid back-up man with both
Scotland and Celtic. Mr Farry says that he was merely implementing an
SFA decision.
The Sun argued that the article was substantially true and represented
fair comment on a matter of public interest.
Mr Farry asked Lord Osborne to rule that the newspaper's defences of
truth and fair comment were irrelevant but the judge took the view that
it would be possible for the two defences, relating to different parts
of the Sun article, to be presented to a jury with reasonable clarity.
The judge said he also had to consider whether a reasonable jury could
decide that the comments made in the story reflected an opinion which a
fair-minded person might honestly hold.
Particular attention had been focused on two paragraphs: ''Lisbon Lion
Tommy Gemmell -- who has known Steeley for 33 years -- last night
blasted the decision and accused Farry of being a dictator.''
The second paragraph read: ''What people like Farry forget is that
they are employees of the SFA and, as such, are there for the good of
the clubs.'
Lord Osborne said: ''In relation to these two passages in particular,
I find myself unable to say that they go beyond the opinions which might
be expressed by a fair-minded person upon the facts which were the
subject matter of the article.
''I consider that the word 'dictator' does not necessarily possess any
very sinister significance based upon historical considerations.
''It appears to me that it is one which is quite commonly applied to a
person acting in a public context who adopts an authoritarian posture.''
The judge decided that Mr Farry's criticism of the relevance of the
Sun's defences were unsound and he allowed the case to go to a jury.

THREE major events in Edinburgh on Sunday are set to bring thousands
of visitors to the city centre.
An estimated 200,000 people are expected to flock to Holyrood Park,
where hundreds of performers will provide an afternoon of entertainment
at the 12th Fringe Sunday.
Thousands of spectators are also expected to line Princes Street at
lunchtime when more than 2500 pipers -- led by entertainer Rolf Harris,
who has mastered the bagpipes for the occasion -- will bid for the world
record for the biggest marching band yet. The pipers, who have come from
as far afield as Chile and Guam, hope to raise over #100,000 for the
Marie Curie Cancer Fund.
Princes Street will be closed again from 5pm in preparation for VJ
celebrations.
A special screen is to be constructed to broadcast the hour-long
sunset ceremony from the Esplanade at Edinburgh Castle to thousands of
viewers lining Princes Street, from 9pm.
Diversions will be in operation until the street is reopened at
midnight.
Police have warned those intending to watch from Princes Street to
take public transport and allow themselves plenty of time to get there.
* There will be a VJ anti-war demonstration, organised by the No More
Hiroshimas peace movement and involving campaigners from all over
Britain, at Fringe Sunday.

ACTOR Steven Berkoff has pulled out of a planned appearance at the
Edinburgh Book Festival today.
Last-minute filming hitches have been blamed for his cancellation.
The actor, director, and playwright is in Los Angeles filming the
movie Fair Game, featuring the debut appearance of model turned actress
Cindy Crawford, but Book Festival organisers learned yesterday the
filming schedule had been extended and Mr Berkoff would be unable to
appear.
He was due to give a talk tonight at the Beck's Famous Spiegeltent but
has now agreed to an appearance at a later date, said organisers.
A spokeswoman for the Book Festival said: ''We were lucky to find him
a new slot in the programme at the last minute and look forward to
welcoming him to Edinburgh next week.''
Mr Berkoff will now be appearing at the Post Office Theatre on August
24, when he will talk about his new title, Overview, and his adaptations
of the classics, such as Hamlet and Macbeth.

GREAT Train Robber Ronnie Biggs was celebrating his son's 21st
birthday yesterday, even though the event could set the clock ticking on
his days of freedom.
Brazilian authorities have always said they would not extradite Biggs
while his son, Michael, was still a child, but now, with his son legally
an adult and a new extradition treaty between Brazil and Britain, his
luck might finally be about to run out.
Speaking from his home in Rio de Janeiro, his refuge for the past
quarter-century, the 66-year-old fugitive said: ''I don't know where I
stand. I've heard about this extradition treaty, but if it affects me in
any way I really couldn't tell.''
He said he would fight any extradition attempt through the courts.
Biggs was jailed for 30 years for his part in the 1963 Great Train
Robbery, but served only 15 months before escaping from Wandsworth
Prison, London, and fleeing to France, Australia, and finally Brazil.
However, attempts to bring him back to justice could still last years.
It could take until next summer for the extradition treaty, which was
signed last month, to be ratified by both the British and Brazilian
parliaments, and the legal battle over any request for Biggs's return
could take years.
The Home Office said: ''We consider extradition a very important tool
in our fight against crime. Where people are at liberty when they should
be in custody, we would always seek to have them returned.''
But Mr Geoffrey Bindman, senior partner with law firm Bindman and
Partners, said: ''I'm sure he could engage in delaying tactics and
challenge an extradition in a Brazilian court. There's room for a lot of
ingenuity. It could take years.''
It was only after Biggs found that his Brazilian girlfriend was
pregnant that he discovered he had given himself a foolproof defence
against extradition.
Scotland Yard tried to extradite him in 1974 after he was tracked down
in Rio, only to find that the country's Law 941 gave him immunity from
extradition as father of a Brazilian child.

SCOTLAND and Japan, I was told during a recent visit to a Japanese
high school, have much in common. ''The geography of both countries is
dominated by high mountains with only limited flat land for settlement
and cultivation,'' one 16-year-old pupil pointed out. ''Japan and
Scotland are leading producers of electronics and other hi-tech
commodities,'' a classmate declared. ''Both countries enjoy whisky and
golf,'' the teacher, Mr Imai, added with a smile.
Mr Imai's class, I guess, had prepared for their first Scottish guest
by brushing up their knowledge of the geography of Scotland. Not only
did they have a good understanding of Scotland's land and its industries
but they could also express themselves in English.
In another class, students were able to talk about the Scottish
pioneers who played such an important role in Japan's industrialisation
and modernisation process. During the second half of the
nineteenth-century, they explained, Japan had ended centuries of
self-imposed isolation by inviting Western academics and industrialists
to help the country develop its economic infrastructure.
One of Japan's most important ''yatoi'', or foreign employees, was
Fraserburgh-born Thomas Blake Glover who was responsible for importing
the first steam locomotive to Japan and helped to build the country's
first slip dock.
Glover was also an important adviser to the fledgling Mitsubishi group
which was to develop into one of Japan's most powerful industrial
conglomerates. Today the group's annual turnover exceeds one hundred
billion pounds.
The famous Scotsman's residence in Nagasaki, which is now the oldest
surviving Western house in Japan, has been preserved as an Important
Cultural Property. More than 1,000,000 people visited Glover House last
year.
In 1873 Henry Dyer, a graduate of Glasgow University, became the first
principal of the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo which later
became the engineering faculty of the University of Tokyo, Japan's
highest-ranked university.
Dyer, and other Scottish academics, helped to train some of the
engineers who were to transform Japan from a feudal society into one of
the world's most successful industrial superpowers.
Japan's other Scottish ''yatoi'' included Richard Henry Brunton, who
set up a string of lighthouses on Japanese waters, and Alexander Shand,
who made a major contribution to the early development of Japanese
banking.
The importance of Japan's Scottish pioneers was highlighted when, in
1908, the Emperor Meiji awarded Thomas Glover the country's prestigious
Order of the Rising Sun. Glover was one of the first foreigners to
receive the honour.
During the 20th century Japan continued to learn from Scottish
industry -- particularly about shipbuilding, train-making and
engineering. ''Japan developed its impressive shipbuilding industry by
adopting the methods used by Scottish shipbuilders and then improving
them,'' Kanezo Sekiya, a professor of engineering, told me.
But while Japanese scientists and engineers have proved to be highly
skilled at copying and improving other countries' inventions they have
been less skilled at making major discoveries themselves. A nation of
123 million people has earned only a handful of Nobel Prizes for
Science. Scotland, with a population of 5,000,000, has won more.
''Scotland has a history of creativity which is envied in Japan,''
Sekiya-San stated. ''Japanese schools and universities are now seeking
to produce the original thinkers the country urgently requires.''
Indeed the long line of original thinkers produced by the Scottish
education system has encouraged Sekiya-San to send his son to study at a
Scottish university. ''Many Japanese parents now recognise the value of
an international higher education,'' he told me.
At the same time the skills of Scottish workers have encouraged a
number of Japanese companies to establish production facilities in
Scotland. Mitsubishi set the trend back in 1979 when it bought a rundown
factory in Haddington and converted it into a hi-tech television
manufacturing plant.
Sixty or more Japanese companies now have production facilities in
Scotland. Earlier this year the huge NEC corporation started work on a
new multi-million pound semiconductor manufacturing plant at Livingston
which will provide jobs for 430 people and push the total number of
direct jobs provided by Japanese companies past the 10,000 mark.
While the Japanese are establishing a presence in Scotland Scottish
companies are doing more business in Japan. Scottish goods, including
knitwear, food and whisky, featured prominently at the series of
international fairs which was recently organised by some of Tokyo's top
department stores.
Several thousand Scots are now living and working in Tokyo, Kyoto, and
Osaka. It is possible to visit a Scottish pub in the Shibuya district of
Tokyo and to take part in a Highland games in Kyoto. Tokyo also has a
branch of the St Andrews' Society which organises regular meetings
between expatriate Scots.
The young people I met in Japan were correct when they said Japan and
Scotland have much in common, but do the majority of Scots know or
appreciate these links? Our knowledge of Japanese history tends not to
extend beyond the unpalatable events of the Second World War and so the
achievements of Japan's Scots-born pioneers, for example, are largely
unknown here.
Perhaps, in the year that the 50th anniversary of the end of the
Pacific War is being marked, it is time for people in Scotland to learn
more about the Japanese connection.
There is also a need for Scotland to exploit the opportunities which
exist for attracting more Japanese investment. The strong yen, and the
rising cost of industrial production in Japan, is expected to force
Japanese companies to build hundreds of new factories in overseas
locations during the next five years.
So what can be done? A start can be made at school where teachers
could be encouraged to introduce short courses on Japanese geography,
history, language, and culture.
Nihongo, the Japanese language, has become the world's fastest-growing
tongue yet few Scots have mastered it. The impressive Centre for
Japanese Studies at Stirling University has helped to promote the
Japanese language among adult learners but now, perhaps, it is time to
offer courses on Nihongo in schools as well.
It was the willingness of local schools to teach their pupils about
Japan and the Japanese language which, it was reported, helped to
persuade the bosses of the Toyota Motor Corporation to locate their huge
new European car assembly plant at Burnaston in Derbyshire.
Scottish cities such as Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen have much to
offer Japanese companies and could certainly do more to attract their
share of Japanese investment. Most of Japan's investment in Scotland has
been concentrated in the new towns of East Kilbride, Livingston,
Cumbernauld, and Glenrothes.
The proximity of Scotland's cities to beautiful countryside, and the
leisure facilities which are available there, is a major attraction to
workers from a chronically overcrowded country where opportunities to
participate in activities such as fishing, sailing, and ski-ing are
severely limited.
One leading Edinburgh-based Japanese industrialist told me that he has
to travel for four hours, and pay #200, for a round of golf at his
''local'' golf course in Japan. In Scotland he has a choice of six golf
courses within half-an-hour's drive from his home.

BRITISH Rail became involved in mountain rescue yesterday when
rescuers in the West Highlands hailed a goods train instead of a
helicopter to get them to the scene of an accident -- and then flagged
down another to get their casualty to hospital.
Belgian nurse Hilda Proost, 25, had fallen into a river gorge and
injured her leg while walking along the railway from Fort William to
Corrour Station with her husband and five friends.
Mrs Proost, from Aartselaar, was taken to Belford Hospital in Fort
William and released after treatment.
Earlier the same day, 16-year- old German student Marcus Leinberger
was airlifted from the shores of Loch nan Cuilc in Strathspey to
Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, with an ankle injury.

TOURISM chiefs in Edinburgh are bracing themselves for a
record-breaking number of visitors to the festival, thanks to the
unusual heat.
Rooms in the city are at a premium as visitors from home and overseas
flock there for the three-week showpiece, apparently undeterred by
reports of rising accommodation costs.
Edinburgh Tourist Board's head of visitors' services, Ms Susan Boyle,
said bookings last month had increased by 28% on July last year, and she
predicted a further increase for the rest of the festival month.
''We are finding little pockets of accommodation here and there, but
people who want a specific establishment will probably find they can't
get it.
''Flexibility is the name of the game,'' she added.
Ms Boyle said staff at the city's main tourist and accommodation
bureaux were working flat out to deal with busy telephone lines and
lengthening queues of visitors.
''I think the good weather has a lot to do with it. As far as domestic
visitors are concerned, they seem to be making a bit more of an effort
to come to Edinburgh.
''Overseas visitors, of course, had planned their holidays anyway.
They are probably staying a bit longer to enjoy the sunshine,'' she
said.
The opening of several new hotels in and around the city had helped it
to cope with the annual influx, but accommodation remains at a premium
ahead of the annual Bank Holiday break, which brings thousands of
visitors from south of the Border.
The leader of Edinburgh District Council, Ms Lesley Hinds, welcomed
the tourist boom as ''excellent news''.

CLIMBER Alison Hargreaves will have to sit out blizzards for at least
another fortnight, waiting for a break in the weather to let her try for
the summit of the world's second-highest mountain.
The mother-of-two is still determined to scale 28,253ft K2 in the same
season as she climbed Everest alone, without Sherpa porters or
artificial oxygen.
There is now only herself and one American left at the base camp at
about 20,000ft.
Derbyshire-born Hargreaves, 33, who lives at Spean Bridge in the West
Highlands, reached the Abruzzi Spur within 2000ft of the Himalayan
summit four weeks ago. However, a ferocious white-out storm, followed by
five days of blizzards, forced her temporarily to abandon her attempt on
the summit.
Yesterday her husband, Mr Jim Ballard, 48, said: ''Alison is very,
very determined, very fit, and well acclimatised to altitude.
''The only thing that will drive her down without making another bid
for the top is the fact that winter will be coming on there by about
mid-September.''

A JUDGE yesterday provided a potential jobs boost for Central region
by refusing to block a plan to sell off publicly-owned business parks.
The sale of Callendar Business Park in Falkirk and Central Park in
Larbert has been agreed between Labour-controlled Central Regional
Council and John Laing Property Ventures Ltd.
Under the deal, Central region would own 50% of the new joint venture
company, with councillors represented on a new joint venture board.
The sell-off is opposed by Falkirk District Council and Falkirk
Council, which on April 1, 1996, takes over the functions of the current
district authority. If the business parks are disposed of before
September 1 this year, the region does not need the consent of the new
Falkirk Council.
After a four-day hearing at the Court of Session, Lord Osborne said
the new Falkirk unitary authority and the existing district council had
put forward an arguable case for interdict.
However, before an order could be granted they had to show that the
balance of convenience favoured intervention by the court.
The main consideration advanced by Falkirk was that if no interdict
were granted the assets at the centre of the dispute -- Callendar
Business Park, Falkirk, and Central Park, Larbert -- could be
irretrievably handed over by Central region to the joint venture
company.
On the other hand, Central region insisted there was a very real and
current demand for expanding and creating new facilities at Central Park
that would require many millions of pounds to be spent by the landlords.
The judge said he had reached the view that, if he granted an interim
interdict, those developments would be unlikely to proceed in the near,
or even medium-term, future given the understandable lack of policy in
this area by the new unitary authority.
He had decided in all these circumstances to refuse the order sought
by Falkirk.
Falkirk and Falkirk district had argued that the existence of the
joint venture could significantly limit the freedom of the new Falkirk
Council to implement the economic strategy it thought was in the best
interests of the area.
After the hearing, Mr Robert Jack, Central's director of
administration, said a joint venture with the private sector would meet
the future development of the business parks.
He denied that it was an asset-stripping exercise and insisted that
the public interest would be protected.

SURGEONS have managed to save the right leg of an eight-year-old girl
injured when she was crushed against a tree by a car.
However, Samantha Maxwell, of Uphall, West Lothian, was undergoing a
further operation to repair her other injuries, including spinal,
pelvic, and shoulder fractures.
Her mother, Mrs Karen Campbell, 32, said: ''It looks as if the
operation to save her leg has been a success.
''But she must have another operation to make sure she's not left
permanantly disabled. We're all praying she pulls through.''
Samantha was hit on Monday night by an allegedly stolen Ford Fiesta as
she was returning home after being out collecting chestnuts with brother
Allan, 11, and pal Kenneth Miller, 12.
Two 20- year-old men appeared from custody at Linlithgow Sheriff Court
before Sheriff Grahame Fleming in connection with the incident.
Mr John Mura, of McLeod Street, and Mr Craig Farley, of Brackensbrae,
both Broxburn, were charged with a number of road traffic offences
including dangerous driving. They were remanded in custody.

IN a dramatic switch yesterday morning, police teams from Greenock
moved into an area of rough ground high above Port Glasgow, in the
continuing search for the remaining parts of the body of armed robber
Michael Doherty.
The officers were acting on information supplied from within the local
community, which has been rife with rumour since the disappearance of Mr
Doherty on June 9.
Teams of searchers stood by as a handful of police walked into an area
of dense whins, reeds, and scrub willow, following a dog trained to
sniff out human remains.
After an hour, in which the black and white collie combed the area
thoroughly, the police withdrew. A senior officer said the collie had
given no indication of a scent.
The ground will be searched again later, along with other similarly
rugged sites close to where the first parts of Mr Doherty's remains were
found.
As the officer leading the hunt, Detective Chief Inspector John
Sherry, yesterday appealed for more information from local people, it
emerged that Mr Doherty, who served a prison sentence in England and who
was known to have had criminal connections with the Newcastle area, may
have been a victim of an underworld contract from that quarter.
Mr Sherry made it clear, however, that whoever disposed of the body of
Mr Doherty -- a 17 stone man with bright red hair -- must have possessed
detailed local knowledge.
Police were alerted by the discovery of a human hand by a local man
walking his dog, and a more detailed search in the bogland area at
Craigmalloch Woods, half a mile outside Port Glasgow and beside the main
road to Kilmacolm, uncovered Mr Doherty's head, his arms, and his legs.
His torso is still missing.
Mr Sherry said yesterday the killing had been barbaric. The
dismemberment of the body had caused severe distress and trauma to Mr
Doherty's family.
''In almost 25 years of police service, during which I have taken part
in many murder inquiries, this is the most brutal and horrific incident
in which I have been involved.
''My appeal today is for anyone who may have further information
regarding Mr Doherty's movements to contact us. We are concentrating our
efforts on recovering his remains, but anyone who has even heard rumours
about his disappearance should contact us.''
He confirmed that Mr Doherty's remains had been identified by DNA
analysis and by study of his dental records. Yesterday, a post-mortem
examination was held in Glasgow.
The dismemberment must have involved some very sharp instrument, he
said, and those who carried it out must have been considerably
bloodstained. As yet, he could not say whether this had taken place at
the point where the remains were discovered, or at some other place. In
either case a vehicle would almost certainly have been used.
Mr Sherry said that but for the extremely dry weather the remains
would probably never have been found. The site off the A761 would
normally have been flooded bog, and the remains had been buried about
three feet down.
Because the bog had dried out, an animal, probably a fox, had found
the remains, moving the human hand 300 yards away into an area where the
passer-by had spotted it.
Police had the remaining water drained from the area by the fire
brigade to allow the search to take place. The bog had helped preserve
the remains.
The scene of the find is visible from Mr Doherty's home, a top floor
flat in Westray Avenue, on the outskirts of Port Glasgow. He was last
seen by his sister in the town's Pladda Avenue, on the morning of his
disappearance.
Mr Doherty's clothing -- a grey tweed jacket with brown leather
patches, a grey sweat shirt, black Adidas training bottoms, and black
Adidas training shoes -- have not been recovered.
Mr Sherry said: ''Mr Doherty was a very well-known person in the area.
We certainly think that at least one of the murderers was local, because
of the local knowledge involved in the concealment of the body.
''It is possible that people from England may have been involved. The
drugs world is only one of the lines of inquiry we are following --
whether he moved in the drugs world. There are a number of positive
leads and the information which has been coming in locally has been
reasonable.
''We know from this that there are other people with information. It
may be that they have been afraid to come forward because of the nature
of this killing, but I would say to them that remaining anonymous is not
a problem. I will speak to them personally if that is required.''
Mr Doherty, a father of three, was due to attend a family wedding on
the day following his disappearance and, when he failed to turn up, he
was reported missing. He had been due to marry a fortnight later.
It was also revealed yesterday that he had been released from a jail
near Newcastle -- from which he had at one point absconded while on home
leave -- in April of this year, having served half of a six-year prison
sentence imposed at Nottingham for armed robbery.

DETECTIVES were unable to confirm yesterday whether a woman whose body
was found in the Castlemilk area of Glasgow was murdered, because the
body was so badly decomposed.
Pathologists who carried out a post-mortem examination yesterday could
not determine how the woman died and are expected to undertake further
forensic tests on the body today, when the cause of death may be
revealed.
The body, which police have been unable to identify, was discovered in
overgrown wasteland behind St Martin's Roman Catholic chapel in
Ardencraig Road, Castlemilk, at about 8.30pm on Tuesday and is believed
to have lain there for more than a month.
Police yesterday declined to confirm or deny reports that the grim
discovery was made by two boys, one believed to be about 10 years old.
A police spokesman said yesterday that detectives were keeping ''an
openmind'' about the cause of death.
A line of inquiry which might assist police in identifying the woman
was being followed yesterday and more information is expected to be
released today. This might include the circumstances of the discovery
and whether the body was fully clothed.

THE Edinburgh husband and wife law team, struck off earlier this year
after being found guilty of professional misconduct and whose business
has now been dissolved, has begun negotiations with others to take over
their case load.
Gordon and Maria Thomson are appealing the decision to take away their
practising certificates. Mr Thomson said last night that talks had not
yet been concluded.
Mr Thomson said their previous partners, Mr Ian Patterson and Ms
Jacqueline Cunningham, were setting up in business in Cowdenbeath, Fife,
and may take on some of the cases and leases.
The Thomsons' expulsion from the legal profession came in June with
the publication of a 125-page judgment by the Scottish Solicitors'
Discipline Tribunal.
Mr Thomson said they were pressing on with the appeal against the
tribunal, whom he blamed, along with the press, for having ''destroyed''
them.
He said they had been forced to dissolve the firm because of the false
allegations of dishonesty against himself and his wife.
He said they were confident of the appeal but if they lost, they would
be looking at other ways of earning a living. ''Obviously it is a very
worrying time for us.''
The Thomsons have accused the legal establishment of a ''vendetta and
witchhunt'', and claimed they were picked on because they were
successful.

THE renowned beauty of one of Scotland's most popular tourist
destinations was shattered this week when marine environmentalists
dubbed its beaches the worst in Britain.
The crew of the Ocean Defender -- Britain's only lifeboat for marine
wildlife -- which is carrying out the first marine litter collection and
survey of Britain's coastline, said it was ''totally unprepared'' for
the scale of Skye's litter-festooned beaches.
Syringes, a 40-gallon drum of chemicals, nets, and fish crates were
among debris piled high in one inaccessible bay near Elgol. Armed with
bin bags, three teams made 10 trips in an inflatable craft but ''barely
scratched the surface'' of another shoreline at Loch Bracadale.
Ms Rachael Irish, scientific and education officer of the 112ft Ocean
Defender, said: ''It would take 50 people and a helicopter to get rid of
it. There is far more than we could begin to cope with.
''We were very depressed at the level of pollution that this litter is
causing on these beaches. It's by far the worst we've seen in Britain.''
Along with volunteers, the crew also tackled coastline at Sleat,
Glenbrittle, and Tarskavaig before leaving for Orkney.
A scoresheet of the types of litter collected will be analysed to
identify the culprits, who will be contacted in a bid to halt the
problem. The information will also be sent to councils and schools.
Skye and Lochalsh District Council's director of environmental health,
Mr Norman Gillies, said the exercise would provide statistical
information on the level of the problem and educate the public against
disposing of litter at sea.
''We are mainly talking about the inaccessible beaches, we are
concerned about the amount of shoreline debris that we are being
engulfed in.''
Head of research for Friends of the Earth, Dr Richard Dixon, said a
recent study on UK beach litter by the Tidy Britain group, revealed that
80% of marine debris came from North American and Canadian ships.
Both he and Glasgow University Zoologists, Dr Roger Downie, think the
Atlantic Ocean currents around Skye could be responsible for the amount
of debris left on the shore by high tides.

TOP flight horse racing is set to return to Lanark, abandoned by the
Jockey Club almost 20 years ago.
Clydesdale District Council's general purposes committee agreed in
principle yesterday to enter into negotiations with Northern Racing Ltd
to bring back horse racing.
The firm is owned by Mr Stanley Clarke, who also owns and is chairman
of Uttoxeter and Newcastle racecourses.
Lanark Councillor Jim Millar was cautiously optimistic that horse
racing would return: ''I have met Mr Clarke and been impressed with his
commitment to a good quality development.''
Councillor David Fanshawe said Mr Clarke had indicated a will to
proceed immediately with feasibility studies. It was hoped to have plans
which could be discussed in public within three months.
Mr Clarke had been in secret talks with the council for several weeks.
It is understood his plans include building a hotel and a number of
chalets at the racecourse. This is a bone of contention with another
party which yesterday failed in an eleventh-hour bid to build a ''care
village'' on the site.
It is understood negotiations with Mr Clarke could stand or fall on
the Lanark course receiving flat racing fixtures under the rules of the
British Horse Racing Board.
Mr Clarke was not available to comment.
Since placed on the market four years ago, the racecourse's future has
been a matter of local controversy because ownership is in the hands of
the Royal Burgh's Common Good Fund.
Councillors had yesterday considered a letter lodged by Lauderdale
Homes Ltd, of Biggar, which proposed a 60-bed nursing home, 40-bed care
home, and 10-bed hospice, plus clinic and therapy centre at the
racecourse.

A BID is to be made to the European Objective One programme for funds
to rescue and complete the windmill which is planned to provide Muck
with electrical power.
The decision was made at talks held in Fort William yesterday
involving the partners in the project, including Highland Regional
Council, the local enterprise company Lochaber Ltd, the Isle of Muck
Community Enterprise Company Ltd, and British Telecom.
The scheme was launched at the same time as the construction of the
#274,000 Muck primary school but progress was delayed by the liquidation
of the main works contractor, Windharvester Ltd, in summer 1994. Since
then, the partners have researched actively the technical and financial
options.
The meeting considered a feasibility study which suggested a way
forward.
Urgent efforts will now be made to assemble a funding package,
including an application for Objective One assistance, towards the
estimated cost of #200,000. Dr Michael Foxley, regional councillor for
the Small Isles, yesterday welcomed the move.
''Highland Regional Council and Lochaber Ltd remain committed to the
project because of its importance to the standards of living in this
most rural of communities.
''The project is similar in importance to the construction of the new
primary school in Muck. It involves a big element of risk and cost but
it is vital to ensure the viability of vulnerable communities. If
successful, the project could be mirrored in other rural communities.''
Mr Ewen McEwen, representing the Muck community enterprise company,
said yesterday: ''The islanders are clearly concerned at the delay
experienced in making the windpower system operational.
''However, I am reassured by the continuing commitment of all the
partners, expressed today, to finding a workable solution to this
impasse. I do not underestimate the hurdles yet to be crossed,
especially in locating the funds needed, but can now see a way forward
which will bring to the island what we have sought from the outset, a
sustainable and cost- effective electricity supply.''

AN urbane, highly-skilled stand-up performer, Diane Ford resembles Bob
Hope at his peak. If old machine-gun-gagster Bob had ever developed an

As well as a scathing honesty about women's wants -- shopping -- and
men's pre-occupations (ie, themselves) and all their doings. Actually,
Diane Ford's physical resemblance is to fluffy Shelley Long. But don't

THE controversy over the effects of Buckfast tonic wine re-emerged
last night after two young men were sentenced to life for the vicious
murder of a 23-year-old Glasgow man.
Mr Alexander McNee, 23, was punched and kicked in the head by Brian
Williamson, 24, and Paul Murphy, 18, who were both under the influence
of a mixture of Buckfast and beer. During a six-day trial before Lord
McFadyen, the High Court in Glasgow was told that the men jumped and
stamped on their victim's face and head.
Mr McNee's father, Mr Alexander McNee, demanded restrictions on the
sale of Buckfast: ''The thugs who killed our son were monsters on it.
But it's still no excuse for what they did to him. Life imprisonment
should mean life but I suppose it would be asking too much in the case
of these murdering thugs if they were actually detained for life.''
The court heard how Williamson and Murphy attacked Mr McNee, a total
stranger, in Gardenside Avenue, a quiet suburban street in Uddingston,
on April 15. During a lull in the attack and as their victim lay
unconscious in a pool of blood, one of them sat on a wall and took a
swig of Buckfast before resuming the attack. An empty Buckfast bottle
was used to pulverise the young man'sface.
Mr McNee was then dragged from the road, dumped behind a tree, and
given another kicking. Williamson and Murphy left him to drown in his
own blood.
Mr Alan Turnbull, prosecuting, said neither Williamson nor Murphy had
been in serious trouble before and had only minor previous convictions
from a district court.
During the case, the court heard how Mr McNee, of Langbar Crescent,
Easterhouse, who would often walk for hours on his own, had left home
telling his parents he was going for a stroll. He walked all the way
from Easterhouse to Uddingston.
Van driver Williamson, of Calderbraes Crescent, Broomhouse, and
apprentice plumber Murphy, of Towie Place, Uddingston, and their
friends, were celebrating the Easter weekend holiday with a potent
mixture of beer and Buckfast. Mr McNee, who had been drinking himself,
accidentally bumped into Murphy in the town's Main Street and was
punched in the face.
In spite of being assaulted, he joined the group and, early in the
morning, when the others had dispersed, Williamson and Murphy launched
the horrific and apparently motiveless attack on Mr McNee. His body was
found the next day by a milkman, his skull and facial bones smashed.
The men were convicted after Mr McNee's blood was found splashed on
their shoes, jackets, and the bottoms of their denims. Murphy's
footprint was also discovered just five feet from the body.
There have been calls in the past from Strathclyde Police and
Monklands East MP, Mrs Helen Liddell, to sell Buckfast in plastic rather
than glass bottles and to reduce its alcoholic strength. Buckfast Abbey
in Devon, where the wine is made, refused to comment yesterday.
A spokesman for the wine's distribution company, J Chandler and Co
Ltd, would only comment: ''You wouldn't blame the car manufacturers if a
driver killed someone.''

THE cherished standards of Glasgow School of Art are under long-term
threat because of cutbacks, its director warned at a book launch
commemorating the institution's 150-year history yesterday.
Professor Dugald Cameron said rising class sizes forced by
Government-led efficiency gains seriously endangered the school's
ability to reproduce past achievements, despite student quality being
''as high as ever''.
The school, whose graduates include Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Tom
Scott, the current director of design for Ford, had a #200,000 funding
shortfall last year and will reduce teacher/student ratios to meet cuts
of 10% over the next three years.
Professor Cameron said at the launch of Glasgow School of Art -- the
History: ''This book illustrates the influence the works and products of
the school have had on day-to-day Scottish and European life.
''However, we are now increasing class numbers and facing great
pressure on space. In a discipline where one-to-one tuition is
important, in the long term we will see an inevitable loss of quality if
the cuts continue.
''But the school's achievements and presence, which lies beyond the
ken of dull officialdom, will sustain us through these difficult
times.''
A 13% increase in applications to 657, the highest in Scotland, has
been received by the school this summer, which disclosed last month that
five teaching redundancies were likely in the coming session.
The book's author, Mr Hugh Ferguson, said the current funding problems
had inspired him in making the book ''both political and practical'' to
illustrate the school's enduring survival against previous cuts.
Artists' contributions appear free in the book, which was sponsored by
the Post Office, whose 1990 Art School commemorative stamp sold 20
million issues around the world.
A print of a male life drawing by final-year student Ms Irene Cavanagh
will be distributed in every book, as an illustration of the school's
continuing excellence.
Ms Cavanagh, 31, a former technician with Boots, said she had
postponed applying to the school for many years because she feared she
could not meet its high standards.
She added: ''In view of this, I'm surprised and delighted, not to
mention thoroughly embarrassed, to have been chosen for this book.''
Other contributors include Robbie Coltrane, Tom Scott, and Alison
Watt, best known for her controversial portrait of the Queen Mother,
which now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery.

THE Serious Fraud Office yesterday made a formal request to question
trader Nick Leeson over the #830m collapse of Barings Bank.
Frankfurt Supreme Court's prosecutor, Mr Hans-Hermann Eckert, said the
SFO had asked for permission for several officials to see Mr Leeson in
prison.
He saw no obstacle to approving an interview, which might last days,
but said it would take two to three weeks to complete the formalities.
Meanwhile, Mr Leeson's lawyers have until August 25 to complete their
case against Singapore's application to extradite the 28-year-old
trader.
A German court is likely to rule on the application in the first half
of next month, but final approval must come from the Government in Bonn.
The SFO decided to interview Mr Leeson after his lawyers dropped
conditions that would have obliged it to seek his extradition to
Britain.
''The reason we're taking up this offer of an unconditional interview
is that it might, at a future date, allow us to put in our own
extradition application, supposing Singapore's request were to fail,''
an SFO official said.

<HEADLINE>Court told of syndicate deal that turned sour over #1.8m payout. Pools winner ignored pact, say friends</HEADLINE>

A POOLS winner faced three former friends in court yesterday when he
was accused of going back on a gentleman's agreement to share his #1.8m
fortune with them.
Former forklift truck driver Paul Pitt, 28, and his wife Teresa won
the jackpot on Littlewoods Pools in May 1993.
Workmates Martin Foulds, Andrew Sullivan and Graham Ware claim Mr Pitt
refused to honour a verbal agreement to pay them #25,000 each as a
goodwill gesture.
The four-man syndicate completed their own separate pools coupons as
well as their joint one -- and it was Mr Pitt's individual entry which
hit the jackpot.
Mr Pitt, of Folkestone Road, Portsmouth, Hampshire, denied the
agreement had ever been made when he appeared at Portsmouth County Court
to contest the High Court writ issued by the trio, who are claiming
#75,000.
Mr Foulds, of Monmouth Road, Portsmouth, worked alongside Mr Pitt and
the two others in a four-man syndicate, which was set up in 1990, the
court heard.
Mr Foulds and Mr Sullivan shook hands with Mr Pitt and agreed that if
any one of them won more than #1m -- the amount they called ''The Big
One'' -- on their own coupon, they would pay each of the other syndicate
members #25,000.
When Mr Ware joined the firm in 1991, he was allowed to join the
syndicate and the agreement was confirmed again, with a shake of hands
witnessed by other workmates, the court heard.
Mr Foulds told the court the agreement to share The Big One was never
put down in writing but there were constant references made to it every
week when the men completed their pools coupons in the teabreak room.
''We didn't think we needed it to be put down in writing. We were all
very close friends and the last thing I could imagine is that we could
all end up in court in the event of one of us winning The Big One,''
said Mr Foulds.
''There was a discussion about the agreement which took place every
week. It wasn't just one talk and we shook hands. I can remember we all
used to stand around talking about what we would do with the money.
''Paul once said if one of us won The Big One and he got his #25,000,
he would use half of it to pay off his mortgage. We used to talk about
going on holidays and buying new cars.''
However, on the day Mr Pitt handed in his notice, Mr Foulds visited
him to ask about the arrangements for sharing the fortune.
''We had a talk on the pavement outside his house and it became clear
to me he wasn't going to honour our gentleman's agreement,'' said Mr
Foulds.
Mr Foulds said Mr Pitt told him he had not won enough to honour the
agreement.
''I was naturally shocked. It wasn't what I expected to hear at all
and I was totally bemused.''
Mr Sullivan, 26, also from Monmouth Road, told the court: ''We didn't
want to appear pushy because we were waiting for Paul to come forward
and give us our money.
''When you go from having nothing in the bank one week to having #1.8m
the next, it must have come as a major shock. He had the press on his
back and financial advisers all the time. We didn't want to interfere.
''Eventually, I decided to talk to him. I asked him about our
gentleman's agreement and he said he hadn't really won enough.
''I was completely amazed. I thought if #1.8m isn't enough, then what
is?
''As far as we are concerned, #25,000 is a lot of money when you
haven't got anything. But when you've got a million pounds or more,
#25,000 is nothing.''
Mr Sullivan said the three friends agreed to approach Mr Pitt that
evening, with Mr Foulds acting as spokesman, but Mr Pitt still refused
to honour the agreement.
''If all three of us had gone round to see him he might have thought
we were being heavy handed and we didn't want that,'' added Mr Sullivan.
Mr Sullivan also said the he and his two friends did not press Mr Pitt
for the money was because they were scared of him.
He claimed Mr Pitt, a Portsmouth FC fan, was a member of the notorious
'657 Crew' a group of supporters renowned for causing trouble and
beating up rival fans at matches.
Workmate Ernie Stillwell, from Portsmouth, told the court he witnessed
the four men making their agreement.
''It was common knowledge at work that the four of them had an
agreement,'' he said. ''If one of them won #1m, he would see the others
all right.''
The case continues.

A DRUNKEN drug addict who led police on a 105mph chase after taking
his foster father's BMW without permission was yesterday jailed for
eight months and banned from driving for five years.
Stirling Sheriff William Reid told Michael Stewart Brown: ''But for
the grace of God you could have killed one or more people -- your
driving could have resulted in real tragedy.
''You drove at grossly excessive speeds and danger to the public for a
distance of eight or nine miles.''
Sheriff Reid said a psychiatrist's report on Brown showed that the
youth was a user of just about every drug available in addition to
drink. Brown, who turned 20 in July, used cannabis, cocaine,
amphetamine, LSD, methadone, and Valium.
The court was told that Brown, then 19, took the car from outside the
house of his foster parents, Fred and Jeanette Leatherby, in Leny Road,
Callander, at about 10.30pm on May 9, leaving a note saying he was
depressed.
Depute fiscal Fiona Robertson said a patrol car caught up with Brown
on the outskirts of town and tailed him as he drove south towards and
through the village of Doune.
Between Callander and Doune on the single-carriageway A84, the
speedometer of the police car registered 105mph, and Brown was still
pulling away, said Mrs Robertson.
His progress was halted between Doune and Dunblane when the engine of
the eight-year-old BMW blew up.
Brown ran off on foot but was quickly apprehended. His blood alcohol
level was 50% above the legal limit.
He admitted dangerous driving, driving with excess alcohol, possessing
amphetamine, taking the BMW without consent, theft, and vandalism.
Referring to the other charges, the court heard that Brown ran out of
his foster parents' house in his underpants on May 27 hallucinating and
screaming for neighbours to call an ambulance after overdosing on
amphetamine.
On June 6, after drinking a bottle of vodka, Brown threw himself at
the window of Kirin Mahal restaurant in Main Street, Callander, smashing
the glass. On August 9, he stole #20 from the till at a restaurant owned
by his foster mother, Capsicum, in Main Street, Callander.
Defence agent Ian Huston said Brown had had a tragic life. Both his
parents had been addicted to drugs and alcohol and both had died of
drug-related causes.

I AM amazed at how the Government has managed to evoke widespread
debate over whether or not the Japanese should apologise for atrocities
committed during the Second World War.
While I would neither wish to measure the extent of the horror meted
out by either side and weigh it on the scales of injustice, nor insult
anyone who was personally a victim of inhuman behaviour, I must question
the reasons for suddenly resurrecting an issue which can only harm
relations between Britain and Japan.
Whether both should apologise or neither should apologise was an
argument that, if it were to be resolved at all, should have been
resolved 50 years ago. If it was not an important issue then, it is
totally irrelevant now.
Manufacturing renewed hostilities, I believe, serves one of two
purposes: it is in the financial interests of elite figures in Britain
to break off diplomatic relations with Japan for reasons we have still
to see develop; or the Government is again diverting the course from its
many problems at home and giving the public a bit of recreation
elsewhere to vent their frustrations.
I hope that, of the two, the latter manoeuvre is the precise one.

I HAVE read with interest the letters and articles regarding the
question of apology from the Japanese Government for the barbarian
treatment of prisoners-of-war during the Second World War.
During the war such was the power of Emperor Hirohito that one lift of
his hand would have called a halt to all atrocities.
But I can fully understand the reluctance of the Japanese to apologise
in view of the fact that after the war Emperor Hirohito was welcomed by
the royal family and indeed driven through the streets of London in a
state carriage. To my mind this action was condonation in every sense of
the word.
If anything was an insult to ex-POWs this occasion topped the bill. I
recall reading a report of an ex-POW throwing a coat at the passing
carriage.
Surely I am not alone in remembering this occasion, or is it the
classic case of the public having very short memories?

I WAS pleased to read the letter from Gordon Graham, ex-1st Cameron
Highlanders, reminding (or informing?) your readers that there was a
very hard-fought campaign waged in Burma some 50 years ago.
My first war experience was in what became known as the Second Arakan
Campaign, which began about New Year in 1943. I have seldom found
anyone, other than Burma veterans, who knows where the Arakan is.
Yet this is where the Japanese Army sustained its first defeat on what
it had fondly hoped would be a triumphal march to Delhi.
The 14th Army's victory was due to its own efforts, good planning, and
the development of a series of air drops of food, weapons, and other
supplies. The Dakotas used were crewed by the American and Royal Air
Forces, and the personnel came from India, New Zealand, Australia,
Canada, and other countries -- a wonderful combined effort, as was that
of the Indian, West African, Gurkha, and British ground forces.
To the shame of Japan, during the campaign their troops overran a
medical dressing station, bayoneting and shooting defenceless patients
and nursing and medical staff, including six doctors, who were lined up
and shot.
Can you wonder that those of us who were there have taken 50 years to
become perhaps more tolerant of the Japanese people?
No-one has a ''good'' war. I still think mine was about the worst.

LET me congratulate you on your presentation of the dropping of the
bomb 50 years ago (August 3).
As an ex-RN (1942 to 46) operating in that theatre of war during this
period, may I say the bomb dropping was not to bring the war to an end.
Rather it was a political decision, for the consequences of which the
world is still paying a very high price. The Japanese were beaten and
making overtures for peace.
Whilst recognising the brutality of the Japanese military to our POWs
(we relieved the Stanley Camp in Hong Kong), this does not justify the
slaughter of innocent civilians in non-military target areas.
Let's get the historical record correct -- the bomb was the
commencement of the cold war, not the defeat of the Japanese.

THE latest US plan for peace in former Yugoslavia is supposed to be
secret but, in the nature of most things Balkan, it is nothing of the
sort. For this reason we know that elements in the proposals amount to a
recognition of land gained through ethnic cleansing. Touting it about
various Balkan and European capitals has not brought success as yet,
although there is some nibbling going on. Nevertheless, the fact cannot
be avoided that to accept the plan is to condone the acquisition of
territory by barbarous means. In particular this refers to the
confirmation of the present Bosnian Serb grip on the eastern enclaves of
Srebrenica and Zepa, both of which appear as Muslim areas on the current
international peace map. Some gains by the Croatians would also be
confirmed. Other areas of land would be ceded to the Bosnian Serbs to
make their possessions more secure. The US plan has built up some
momentum, particularly as the Russians appear keen to endorse the
territorial transfer referred to. Unfortunately for Washington, the
Russians appear no more ready to accept the other part of the plan which
is the promise of a lifting of the arms embargo and pressure for heavy
Nato air strikes if the Bosnian Serbs refuse to agree.
Many elements of previous peace plans for the area are to be found
nestling in the latest proposals but the energy demonstrated by
Washington in formulating and pressing the present proposals is
impressive, if a little late in the conflict. The flexibility built in
could also be creative. The US is prepared to allow changes to the plan
if the warring parties can agree and as long as the Muslim-Croat
alliance holds on to the 51% of territory already agreed. If agreement
is reached there is a promise of international aid to rebuild Bosnia. If
they cannot agree, the tougher measures already described are brought
into use. None of this answers the question of whether land seized and
ethnically cleansed should be permanently ceded to the victors. In
principle this is repugnant. It is a confirmation that might is right,
and while this dismal little cliche may accurately describe concrete
events in many parts of the world, it is still hard to see it enshrined
in international agreements. Nevertheless, we are faced with the problem
of constructing alternative proposals if these ones are unacceptable.
One of the dispiriting elements of the fighting in former Yugoslavia
is that in many respects that country had reached a point of apparently
substantial ethnic tolerance. A large proportion of marriages in the
country before 1991 were ethnically mixed, as were those in many of the
communities around it. This has made the issue of ethnic cleansing
simultaneously more horrible and more difficult to define and untangle.
Distressing as it is, there may come a time when it is more desirable to
end the fighting and avoid the pain of more deaths, maimings and ethnic
cleansings, than it is to carry on the conflict with the aim of
returning every scrap of former Yugoslavia to its former owners. For
these reasons, if not others, the current peace plan should be
prosecuted with energy and with the support of Western Governments.

AFTER nearly two years in which the monthly totals fell, unemployment
rose again last month. The amount was minuscule but the movement
significant and not least because, if it echoes previous cycles, it
leaves the outstanding numbers out of work higher than at any comparable
point since 1945. It is as if the irreducible minimum keeps getting
higher, which is a disturbing thought. In fact, however, the turn may
not really have arrived, for those looking for work are always
reinforced in the summer as the universities decant a goodly number of
job-hungry students. But that is an annual event and there is no real
doubt that the fundamental trouble is that the economy is now slowing
too fast to generate more employment. Should this really surprise? The
last two Chancellors and their last four budgets have steadily siphoned
off personal spending power to pay the public debt which climbed rapidly
after Mrs Thatcher fell from power and Mr Major sought, successfully
enough politically, to ensure that he won the 1992 election.
That debt has been greatly reduced but not yet brought entirely under
control, and other statistical evidence confirms the persistence of what
might intriguingly but plausibly be deemed a spenders' strike. Having
created the most efficient retail sector and most consumer-oriented
society in Europe, we are suffering from its inability to tempt us into
spending except at a very modest rate of growth. The explanations are
well-enough known, from the (often shrinking) personal reserves tied up
in the stagnant housing market to the psychological caution forced upon
securely employed people because of the perception that almost no
employment enjoys security any longer. And who is to say that people are
not prudent to consider this new dimension (established for far longer
in the US)? The fact that they do consider it, reduces retail spending
and takes much of the domestic bounce out of a recovery which has been
focused on the export industries. Just possibly the sort of largesse
pouring into pockets from LLoyds Bank's take-over of the Cheltenham and
Gloucester building society this year, and the Abbey National's
absorption of the National Provincial as well as the Leeds-Halifax
merger which will make its impact next year, will induce a spending
spree. For these monies, which in aggregate are immense, represent
windfalls. It remains to be seen whether they might not just as easily
be retained to augment savings; there is certainly only the scantiest
evidence of that old propensity to spend, despite numerous sales.
The silver lining is that these developments, coupled with the steady
level of low earnings growth, mean that inflationary pressures are far
less acute than perceived by the Bank of England, and the pressures in
fact have been eased by stronger sterling. The Chancellor has been
taking something of a gamble these past three months that inflationary
prospects are, and will remain, subdued. His division of opinion with
the Governor of the Bank of England has been genuine -- and mirrored
among economic and financial commentators -- but so far he has been
justified. He must now consider whether the employment figures demand a
bigger gamble in the shape of a small interest rate cut rather than the
small increase wanted by the Governor. No doubt he will want to wait
another month, but lower interest rates will stimulate economic activity
far faster and more comprehensively than the income tax cuts the Tory
back benchers lust after. For one thing their impact is immediate and
benefits hard-pressed borrowers in business as well as in housing. Of
course such a policy is not without risk but neither is the alternative
which, incidentally, would force unemployment up further.

WITH all the interest in local archaeology engendered by the temporary
return of the Lewis chess pieces, the opening of a new museum in
Stornoway, and the opening of the Calanais Standing Stones Visitor
Centre, is it not ironic that the Western Isles is one of the few
Scottish regional or island authorities to have no local
government-funded archaeology service?
Clearly the Western Isles Council is aiming to accrue wide-ranging
benefits to communities through the promotion of what is a unique
archaeological heritage, and it must be applauded for recognising the
potential in following this course.
It is, however, particularly interesting to speculate on how much more
could be achieved with the help of in-house archaeological expertise.
Fundamental issues if conservation represent even more serious issues.
The Government guidance on archaeology within local authorities,
National Planning and Policy Guidelines 5 -- Archaeology and Planning,
recommends that as a minimum local authorities should have access to
sound archaeological advice and a professionally maintained sites and
monuments record.
The potential damage which can be caused to sensitive (and, in many
cases, hidden) archaeological remains during many modern developments
presents a serious worry. These two fundamental services must be
available to planners on a daily basis.
To compound the problems facing archaeology as we head towards local
government reorganisation in April of next year, Historic Scotland has
made it clear that the ''safety net'' which it previously provided in
terms of offering emergency advice to regions or island authorities
without in-house archaeologists (including Tayside and Lothian) is to be
withdrawn.
Although the Western Isles Council is to remain geographically
unaltered, internal structural changes are inevitable. All in the
archaeological community in Scotland therefore urge the council to
recognise this opportunity at a time of flux, and to take a positive
step towards safeguarding the islands' irreplaceable archaeological
resources.
The appointment of a council archaeologist remains the logical answer.

I WAS interested to read of Alex Salmond's fruitful cultural exchange
experience at the John Hewitt Summer School in Ireland (August 9).
I spent some time this summer as an invited artist participant at a
graduate summer school in Europe with the overall theme, Cultural Change
in Europe: Urban Culture.
Graduate students, scholars, and creative artists from Rostock on the
Baltic to Marseilles and Naples on the Mediterranean gathered to debate
in English and French multiculturality and other aspects of urban
culture in Europe, including the tensions which arise when the arts are
used not for themselves but in the service of economic development and
tourism.
Scotland was represented among the participants and Glasgow, European
City of Culture 1990, featured in several presentations including my
own, where my experience as artist during the Year of Culture and the
fate of the Concert Hall paintings (now deteriorating in unsatisfactory
storage conditions in the Tramway) aroused much interest and no little
astonishment, providing as they did a bleak illustration of the
''culture in the service of something else'' theme.
Returning to Alex Salmond's article and the John Hewitt Summer School,
I would suggest that we in Scotland could learn from both the Irish and
the European summer school experiences, extending our understanding of
the interculturality within our own country while participating also in
the wider multicultural European experience with the perspectives it
would bring to our perception of how we conduct our affairs in Scotland.
Interestingly, there is at this very time a visual art exhibition of
work by Scottish painters, printmakers, sculptors, and photographers
which spans both activities.
The exhibition Calanais, emanating from An Lanntair Gallery in
Stornoway, Lewis, and taking the Calanais stones as its theme, is
currently on show at the Festival Interceltique at Lorient in Brittany,
thus bringing together both internal exploration and external
relationships.
We need to find ways of developing both these elements if we in
Scotland are to mature culturally. A cultural summer school programme
might provide a useful starting point.

AS a member of the National Trust for Scotland and a keen gardener I
have abundance of imaginative sympathy for the NTS and the Wright
brothers over the prolonged disagreements at Arduaine (August 12).
However, my advice to the elderly brothers, even should the
magnificent gardens become a wilderness, is to retire from the fray and
enjoy the years that remain to them in the peace and beauty of Argyll
with its bonus of so many glorious sunsets over the western seas.

* THE Festival has now passed the halfway point in its first week, and
audiences have been flocking to performances all over Edinburgh. And so
has The Herald's top-rated team of reviewers, bringing you in-depth,
authoritative coverage of the world's greatest arts jamboree.
Those reviewers have been looking out for examples of excellence
across the whole range of the Edinburgh spectrum -- Festival, Fringe,
film, visual arts, and books -- as possible recipients of Herald Angels,
our highly-coveted figurines that will represent the distinctive form of
critical acclaim. And the nominations have been coming in thick and
fast.
Two Herald Angels will be presented in a special ceremony at the
Festival Theatre on Saturday by acclaimed actress Janet Suzman -- and
the recipients of their consoling counterparts, the Little Devils, for
those at whom Dame Fortune has cocked a snoot, will also be unveiled.
Watch this space to find out what's really happening in Edinburgh.

She rushes to tears and others rush to restore her radiance. She would
be alone; she would appear before her public. Princess Diana's behaviour
continues to baffle those who might measure sympathy against
commonsense. Margaret Vaughan considers the latest turbulent chapter of
a fairytale turned sour
RARELY can such a ragbag of psychobabble, tittle-tattle, and cod
psychology have been applied to one person. The Princess of Wales is
under immense emotional strain, as can be seen by anyone who hasn't left
the planet. The latest instalment in the continuing drama of Diana: A
Princess in the Process of Disintegration brings us the news that she
broke down and sobbed uncontrollably for 10 minutes at her health club
after seeing her sons off for a holiday with Prince Charles.
Staff rushed to comfort her, pat her bowed head, hold her trembling
hand, as she wept over the three-week separation from ''her babies'' or
so an anonymous onlooker at the fashionable Harbour Club in Chelsea
tells the Sun.
It's baffling. The incident is reported to have happened minutes after
she was spotted chatting to England rugby skipper Will Carling in the
gym, hours before news of their friendship broke: yet it's weeks before
the story surfaces, and almost as soon as the reverberations surrounding
their purely platonic relationship begin to die down.
Isn't it odd that this imagery of an anguished princess in the throes
of another emotional crisis contrasts so sharply with her powerful
response to stinging hands-off-my-man rebukes from Mrs Carling, and
Diana's staunch insistence that she had no reason to reproach herself?
Can it be true? If so, is it any of our business anyway? Frankly, yes.
She is our responsibility. We invented her.
So enchanted were we by the romantic fiction of royal life that we
celebrated the monarchy's voracious appetite for sacrificial virgins.
Shy Di was just the job. That it was a mistake to toss an inexperienced,
frankly fairly dim, young woman into the role is barely acknowledged,
even now. And only then in terms that confirm the hypocrisy of romantic
myth foisted on a teenage nursery assistant who, in the jargon, was the
product of a dysfunctional family.
Few courtiers have such an intimate knowledge of the royal family as
Lord Charteris of Amisfield, former private secretary to the Queen. In
an interview, held to have the imprimatur of the Windsor's earlier this
year, he conceded: ''The pity is that the Prince of Wales had to marry a
virgin.''
The fairytale princess turns out to be an emotionally fragile young
woman whose inner life is so empty she craves and seeks public adoration
to give her a sense of herself. If she seems to be making herself up as
she goes along, it is not perhaps surprising.
She is contradictory about what she wants.Almost all her adult life
has been lived in a state of tacit collusion with newspapers and
photographers. She wants to be photographed because she wants
affirmation of the way she looks. When she doesn't need it, it becomes a
violation. The greedy gaze of the telephoto lens is a torment or a
suitor depending on her mood.
She seeks solitude and privacy, announces it in a trembling voice in
public, and the very next day just happens to turns up at a charity
event, eyes downcast, hiding conspicuously behind her handbag.
She variously dazzles, glitters, radiates, stuns, shines, or trembles,
weeps, flings herself down stairs and smears blood from self-lacerated
wrists on the walls of aeroplanes. She is good at looking vampish,
slicked back hair, sheath-tight cut-to-the-crotch frock and
unsurpassable at looking vulnerable.
What is this about?
Contradictions are of the essence, and Diana is the perfect mass of
them. Married yet alone, bereft mother cruelly separated from her
children, coy seductress, concerned with the poor living under the
London bridges yet a shopaholic condemned to eternal spending sprees in
Knightsbridge. Perhaps in Diana's internal landscape what matters is how
you feel, not how things really are.
Not even her besotted biographer, Andrew Morton, can escape the
contradictions, nor make sense of them. In his latest tome he paints a
picture of a woman who on one hand seems to have vanquished her
emotional demons and on the other is, frankly, off her rocker.
Who knows? Whatever she is, Diana is not the best advert for Prozac,
the ''liquid-sunshine'' drug trendy with clenched creative types and
manic writers. Morton says she is using it to combat the eating disorder
bulimia nervosa from which she has suffered (there's that word again)
since her marriage.
She believes -- if we are to believe Morton, and she has not disowned
him -- that in a previous incarnation she was a nun; has an obsessional
interest in mystics, tarot cards and clairvoyants. She often tries to
''contact'' dead friends and relatives and retains a deep fascination
for Charles's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles, plotting on a map
how and where the couple meet.
Morton reveals that Diana hopes one day to divorce, but not yet. She
doesn't want to be blamed for a constitutional crisis. That terror of
the loss of her adoring public? But she hopes to remarry and have two
more children, preferably girls.
Meanwhile, she continues to divide her time between therapists,
including Susie Orbach, renowned for her work on eating disorders, and
an American business-motivation guru. She goes for colonic irrigation at
a clinic where 12 treatments cost -- you might like to sit down at his
point -- #1000.
She has had a series of ''close relationships'' with a series of
remarkably similar men, cleaving perhaps to her own tribe, but finding
that even oiks with floppy hair kiss and tell: instead she has developed
a series of friendships with married men. Are they safer because they
too have something to lose? Or is it more complex than that, a fear of
becoming involved? It all depends which of the legion of ''friends'',
ever-ready with an obliging quote, you believe.
David Dimbleby's biography of the Prince of Wales, by contrast, offers
us no contradictions in its picture of a man tormented by an
extraordinarily difficult woman. Maybe she was, but it seems a bit
unchivalrous to hint at mental instability. Especially since we learn
from the usual suspects that it was not his wife but his mistress that
he cherished, throughout the marriage and beyond.
Dramatic emotions are played out for us against suitable backdrops
chosen, it seems, to replicate the inner pain: alone outside the Taj
Mahal, alone at Christmas Dinner in Kensington palace: alone and weeping
in her luxurious apartments, eating scrambled egg for supper and then
throwing it up.
According to the constitutional historian Dr David Starkey, of the
London School of Economics, who's writing a book on modern monarchy, the
insinuations that Diana is unhappy, neurotic, or just plain crazy, have
transformed themselves into an added attraction which bring out a man's
protective instincts.
''She's so popular because she is totally empty; like Marilyn Monroe.
There is a lacquered, too-perfect quality about them. Diana doesn't even
sweat when she goes to the gym.
''She has an iconic quality of being a complete blank you can read
anything on to, can project fantasies on to.'' Sad, that.
Perhaps Simone de Beauvoir described it best. When writing about Greta
Garbo, she described her as offering a kind of emptiness into which
anything could be projected. Maybe acting out the role of goddess,
whether screen or royal, leaves the individual little sense of true
worth. Then again, maybe she's just a rich, spoiled brat who won't grow
up.
It's not impossible to feel sympathy for a wretched young woman who's
gone on record as detailing her suicide attempts, her emotional
difficulties and her loneliness, and to accept that control of her own
life escapes her. Nor is it impossible to wonder precisely who it is
that denies her that control? You? Me? I don't think so.

William Russell talks to Ingeborga Dapkunaite, whose performance in
Burnt by the Sun could launch her to international stardom, about fiery
co-stars
IS Nikita Mikhalkov, whose Oscar-winning Burnt by the Sun is one of
the festival's hits, really the tyrant he gave every indication of being
when I met him a last year in Cannes? Ingeborga Dapkunaite's face
crinkled with glee. Her eyes spoke volumes. Discretion, however,
prevailed. She plays his wife, Marussya, in the film and her performance
ought to launch her on to the international film scene.
''He likes it his way and needs to be in complete control,'' she said
in impeccable English. ''He wrote it, he directed it, he starred in it
and if he decides he is not shooting this scene, that is it. It may take
five days to work things out, but we are going to sit down and work it
out. He raised the money and he has the luxury of stopping and finding
out how to do the scene really well.''
A Lithuanian, trained in Vilnius, where she worked in the theatre, she
has made several Russian films. Three years ago John Malkovich was
looking for an Eastern European actress for a play he was doing, and she
was one of four from Russia who auditioned.
She ended up appearing at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, and on
Shaftesbury Avenue. She also married the play's director, Simon Stokes,
and now lives in London. She spent four months making Burnt by the Sun
two years ago and, although it looks as if it was made in high summer,
she ended up working in freezing temperatures with snow on the ground
because they had started filming in August when the corn was ripe, but
had gone over time.
Filming in the West was very different from in Russia, she said. It
was luxury compared to what she had been used to. Actors did not have
caravans to rest in and were lucky to get a chair. For the first month
on Burnt by the Sun they had a caravan, but caravans are scarce in
Russia, Police Academy was filming, and it was taken away.
Acting with Malkovich seems to have been, if anything, more terrifying
than acting with Mikhalkov. ''John is an unpredicable actor and one has
always to be on one's toes,'' she said. ''You wonder -- what is he going
to do now? -- every single show. Is he going to throw something at me?
Is he going to jump on me. Yes he is. Now! But I loved it.''
She wants to work again in the theatre in Britain, has just finished a
small role in the Tom Cruise film, Mission Impossible for Brian de
Palma, and is about to start a Sky TV movie with Rob Lowe playing a girl
who is good, then not so good. She has also appeared with Malkovich at
Steppenwolf in Libra, a play he wrote about Lee Harvey Oswald.
She was Marina Oswald and a Texas stripper. She grinned engagingly at
the very idea. ''I had a white wig with black roots and a cowgirl hat,''
she said.
THE body count is high, the stunts are spectacular, the energy is
formidable, but the wit which made Robert Rodriguez's
no-budget-to-speak-of-movie, El Mariachi, at Edinburgh in 1993, is
missing from his big bucks Columbia-financed sequel, Desperado. The
compensating factor is Antonio Banderas now plays the guitar player.
Drool time, girls and boys. On release soon, so not long to wait.
This year's no-budget triumph is Mute Witness, a horror film written
and directed by Anthony Waller which combines genuine thrills with some
wildly over-the-top comedy. Shot in Russia, it is about a trio of
Americans making a horror movie in a ramshackle studio.
Prop girl Billy (Marina Sudina), a deaf mute, kept late at work
discovers that the Russian crew is making a snuff movie on the side. Cue
for frightened lady routine. It is when the director and his girlfriend
finally realise something is wrong and the bad guys set about trying to
silence everyone that the jokes start to flow. Waller never puts a foot
wrong. A treat by any standards.
Among the short films, BBC Scotland's Nightlife directed by Patrick
Harkins stands out. Katrin Cartlidge plays an agoraphobic whose flat
overlooks Kelvingrove Park, who spend the time, Jimmy Stewart fashion,
viewing the world through her camera lens.
One night she snaps a man being abducted and tells the police, who
consider her a nutcase. Can she save him? Dare she leave the flat? The
life of the park after dark is amusingly portrayed, although I have my
doubts about the accent sported by Jane Horrocks as the comic relief.
She plays a university yuppie abandoned by her kilted friend who is too
drunk to achieve his ambition of doing it it al fresco, leaving her to
make friends with a couple of men up to no good in the bushes. There is
a neat final twist which, for once, one does not see coming a mile off.
Cartlidge also stars in Three Steps to Heaven, a curate's egg directed
by Constantine Giannaris, as a woman whose toy-boy lover has died in
mysterious circumstances. She sets out to track the three dissolute
people who were with him, a wide boy, a homosexual MP and a chat-show
host. Giannaris shows promise, but more work should have been done on
the script.

* A road-rage motorist was jailed for eight years yesterday for
shooting at a van driver who was sitting on his tail on a busy London
road.
Gary Nelson, 26, fired from his BMW driver's seat at builder Gary
Kewell's vehicle, hitting the radiator and bonnet.
Mr Kewell had tried to overtake Nelson after he repeatedly slowed at
corners in Merton Road, Wandsworth, south-west London.
However, Nelson accelerated away each time, cut him up, and the pair
exchanged obscene gestures, said Mr William Boyce, prosecuting.
''They pursued each other with Nelson going down the road with Mr
Kewell very close behind. Mr Kewell could see Nelson pointing down to
the passenger footwell. He thought there was going to be trouble, became
frightened, and decided to turn right and drive away.''
However, Nelson had picked up a gun from the footwell and fired five
times at the van.
He was convicted of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life
and having a firearm with ammunition in a public place but was cleared
of attempted murder.
The Common Serjeant of London, Judge Neil Denison, told him he had a
strong suspicion there was more behind the case than the evidence had
revealed.
Nelson, of Earlsfield, south-west London, had denied attempted murder
and the firearm offences. He was cleared by the jury of eight men and
four women of attempting to murder a man two weeks earlier following an
alleged argument in a night club.

Actress Pauline Collins played an unusual role yesterday at the Royal
Lyceum Theatre. Alison Kerr explains
ACTRESS Pauline Collins was the main attraction at a workshop
organised by the Scottish Actors Studio in Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum
Theatre yesterday. The Oscar-nominated star of Shirley Valentine led an
all-day session on self-perception and self-presentation aimed at actors
who are coming back to the profession after an absence, and those who
perform badly at auditions.
Collins encouraged the six non-working actors who took part in the
event to analyse their own personalities and then perform a brief
audition piece for her, which she then critiqued. Seventy other actors
observed proceedings and offered support. Andy Byatt, director of the
Scottish Actors Studio, declared the day a success. He said: ''It's
fantastic. There's a fabulous feeling of comradeship and community, and
no sense of 'I should be up there, and not you'.''
These sentiments were shared by others who attended. Observer Astrid
Wilson said: ''I've had a great day. I've realised that everyone is in
the same boat, so I don't feel so isolated.'' The workshop -- the third
in a series of six this week -- was sponsored by the Hamada Foundation,
Scottish Television, Edinburgh District Council and the Royal Lyceum.
Byatt, who has already persuaded the likes of Rutger Hauer and Simon
Callow to take workshops since the Actors Studio began in March 1994, is
now examining the possibility of making a film with studio participants,
with the help of Tutti Frutti star Maurice Roeves.

A MOTORIST in the Borders has had his car attacked by a driver who
stuck an axe into the side of his car after an angry incident on the
road.
Two men, said to have been involved, made off in a blue car, after the
incident at a junction leading to Newtown St Boswells, about 1.25pm on
Tuesday, as both cars were travelling north.
Police are appealing for witnesses, after interviewing photographer
Angus Blackburn, 31, who was driving his green Audi estate car at the
time.
Although two men have been interviewed by police officers, a
spokeswoman said no charges had been made.
Mr Blackburn, from Ancrum, near Jedburgh, said last night he had been
frightened by the events, although his car was repairable.
He had overtaken a green and white caravan, followed by two men who
began gesticulating at him. He pulled over to allow them to pass, at the
approach to the junction.
Lothian and Borders Police said that the passenger then struck the
driver's side door with an axe.
Mr Blackburn said: ''At first, I thought it was a sledgehammer. Had it
been four inches higher, it would have struck the window, rather than
the door panel.
''I did not want to become involved and immediately informed police.
''Road rage is the term used often these days and it seems apt.''
The police official said: ''We need to speak to the driver of the
vehicle towing the caravan, as well as the driver of a red
N-registration Rover 418 saloon who was travelling north when the
incident occurred.''
Police ask anyone who can help with their inquiries to contact them on
01450 375051.

FORMER Cabinet Minister John Redwood yesterday announced the formation
of a think tank aimed at promoting his beliefs and preparing his next
challenge for the leadership of the Conservative Party.
Although he claims the Conservative 2000 Foundation will be ''an open
house and a broad church'' working for the party, it is widely expected
to serve as a rallying point for disgruntled right-wing Tory MPs who
supported Mr Redwood in his unsuccesful attempt to oust Mr Major last
month.
It will be run by Mr Redwood's former political adviser, Mr Hywel
Williams, and will be modelled on the Centre for Policy Studies, set up
in 1974 by Baroness Thatcher and her supporters as the ideological
launching pad for her premiership.
Yesterday, Mr Redwood denied the group was designed as a challenge to
Mr Major and emphasised it was open to all Conservatives and their
supporters. Nevertheless, his ideas, including his call for an immediate
#5000m cut in public spending, are placed at the centre of its
objectives.
He admitted he still harboured leadership ambitions: ''If there were a
vacancy, several of us, including myself, might like to apply again, but
that isn't the issue. It has been settled. There was a clear result. I
am following John Major's lead and accept him as leader of the party.''
Mr Williams refused to detail the foundation's backers but they are
believed to include a number of Lady Thatcher's long-standing
supporters, including Mr Greville Howard, who owns the electronics group
Arlen as well as the Westminster house which serves as the foundation's
temporary base.
Its first publication is a list of suggested answers to the
questionnaire being sent to Conservative Associations across the country
at the Prime Minister's instigation, as part of his promise to extend
consultation.
Mr Redwood said the foundation intended to make a positive
contribution to the consultation exercise: ''Our first task is to unite
and carry the party forward.
''We are responding to the Prime Minister and Tory Central Office's
questionnaire. It was a bold move to ask the voluntary party to
contribute. We are responding in a friendly spirit with ideas that can
help him.''
The questionnaire covers all aspects of Government policy, from the
economy to law and order, with questions ranging from ''who should
benefit from tax cuts?'' to ''how can we make the Union of Peoples more
relevant to its constituent parts?''.
Mr Redwood opposes devolution, believes families and home owners
should receive Government help, wants the use of closed-circuit
television to be extended in the fight against crime, and is committed
to halting the drift of sovereignty from Westminster to Brussels.

<HEADLINE>No hosepipe ban as Eastwood 'goes easy' on water usage</HEADLINE>

EFFORTS are being made in parts of Strathclyde and the Highlands to
conserve water in the hope that it will not be necessary to impose a
hosepipe ban in the face of continuing drought. However, consumers in
Fife have been given a week to co-operate or face a ban.
In Strathclyde, a conservation appeal in the Eastwood and Newton
Mearns area appeared to be working and a hosepipe ban was not under
consideration.
More than 20,000 leaflets were distributed to householders over the
weekend urging them to avoid using sprinklers and hosepipes because of
what a spokesman called ''an unreasonable demand on the local system''
causing falling water pressure. ''It does not constitute a ban, but we
are asking people to go easy,'' he added.
He said the area was served by a 1920s pipe network which, although it
had been since updated, could not cope with the recent housing
expansion.
These difficulties were exacerbated by the relative distance and
uphill route water travelled from Loch Katrine reservoir to reach
Eastwood compared to other residential city areas, he added.
Strathclyde reported levels of 54%-63% in its three principal
reservoirs, a higher reserve than at this time last year.
''Water levels are seldom what people expect and most have probably
forgotten that we had a very wet winter,'' said the spokesman.
Highland region predicted that Tuesday's hosepipe ban on the Dingwall
and Black Isle area would continue ''into the foreseeable future''. It
also reported that a similar ban in the Badenoch area was now under
serious consideration.
Fife, meanwhile, will add to the growing roll-call of hosepipe bans in
the UK within a week unless householders exercise ''caution and
co-operation'', a senior water official said yesterday.
0 The Fife warning follows a regional council forecast that
reservoirs, already languishing more than half empty, will continue to
be drained without rain to replenish them into September.
* North West Water, under fire for the way it manages supplies,
yesterday became the first in England and Wales to introduce a hosepipe
ban across its area.
* Scotland's three new public water authorities have agreed to open
their meetings to the press and public in an effort to counter the
strong criticism levelled at the Government's policy of removing water
and sewerage services from council control.
Yesterday, however, Cosla's senior vice president, Labour Councillor
Keith Geddes, dismissed the moves as ''window dressing''. He insisted
the decisions by the water quangos to hold open meetings did not change
their fundamentally undemocratic nature.
Both the West of Scotland Water Authority and its eastern counterpart
are to hold their first full formal meetings in Glasgow and Edinburgh
next week. The North of Scotland Authority had its first meeting earlier
this month when it agreed its main base would be in Inverness.

Music
YOU just cannot beat old-style piano playing -- no perfumed antics, no
limp-wristed stroking of the keys, no mannerisms, and no messing.
Yesterday, to an ovation that might have been reserved for a
superstar, veteran Catalan pianist, Alicia de Larrocha, gave a recital
that was an exemplar of its type.
She's tiny and ever so slightly frail-looking as she mounts the steps
to the platform. She's 72 and plays with the vigour and passion of
somebody half a century younger. What a class act she is. Completely
unfussy, she sat down at the piano, polished her glasses, placed her
hands on the keyboard, and took her audience off to the stars.
The only visible evidence of her age came when the going got tough,
the notes got fast -- and I mean fast -- and there was a sense of
splashiness with the odd tumble on to a neighbouring wrong note. But
this was nothing. The entire recital -- to a standing-room only crowd --
was a model of musical vivacity and integrity.
After a couple of introductory sonatas by Soler, de Larrocha plunged
straight into the heart -- and soul -- of Spain with the Spanish Dances
of Granados. Oh how she played these: the colours rose off the
instrument, rich and dark, the sense of heat, the dust, the stamp and
twirl of flamenco, the soulful stir of duende. It was like a magnificent
improvisation.
The great lady -- to call her old would be an insult -- then proceeded
to give a stunning account of Schumann's Carnaval that caught
comprehensively the multiple moods of this immense character piece. She
is a supreme colourist, a rare lyricist, and -- as for characterisation
-- suffice to say that she played the coquettish movements with all the
flirtatiousness of a 16-year-old. Heartlifting stuff.

MEMBERS of the Scots charity Edinburgh Direct Aid will set out on
their 25th mission to Bosnia today in defiance of the dangers
highlighted earlier this week by the deaths of two British aid workers
near Sarajevo.
It is still unclear when the bodies of Mr Neil Golightly, 34, from
Broomhill, Glasgow, and Mr Tony Richards, 49, from Godalming, Surrey,
will be returned to the UK. It is understood that French Unprofor troops
are helping to organise their return.
Mr Tim Stew, a British Embassy spokesman in Sarejevo, said yesterday
the UN was ''exploring every possibility'' to ensure the quick return of
the bodies.
Negotiations were continuing with Serbian forces to let the bodies be
flown out to either Zagreb or Split for the onward journey to the UK.
However, if this request was refused by the Serbs the bodies would
have to travel by land, which would take longer, he said.
The two men were killed on the Mount Igman road to Sarajevo early on
Tuesday when their truck, carrying food parcels to the besieged Bosnian
capital, crashed after the convoy it was travelling in came under fire.
It is understood they had been driving without lights -- a standard
practice adopted by aid convoys -- to try to avoid attracting gun fire
but that they were forced to accelerate sharply when they came under
attack.
They had been part of a convoy organised by the Surrey-based charity,
Phoenix Aid International Direct, which Mr Golightly helped establish in
September last year.
Yesterday, the director of Edinburgh Direct Aid, Dr Denis Rutovitz,
66, and 11 other volunteers, including his wife Dr Jeanne Bell, made the
final preparations in loading four aid lorries which will leave today
for Bosnia.
The convoy will be forced to use the same route used by the Phoenix
Aid workers as it is the only access to Sarajevo. The mission is
expected to take six weeks.
As he reflected on the fate that had befallen Mr Golightly and Mr
Richards, Dr Rutovitz said: ''We must go on with our mission. There is
no alternative route into Sarajevo.''
The retired mathematician, who was hit in the arm and chest by sniper
fire four months ago while driving an aid truck along the stretch of
road where the two men were killed, added: ''We know the dangers we are
facing but our hearts are telling us to take the risk.''
In July 1993, a fellow Edinburgh Direct Aid volunteer, Mrs Christine
Witcutt, 52, a mother of two, was killed by sniper fire as she returned
from an aid mission to Sarajevo.
Her husband, Mr Alan Whitcutt, 65, yesterday issued a message of hope
to the families of the latest victims by advising them to ''take
comfort'' from the fact that the two men died doing something
worthwhile.
Dr Rutovitz is hopeful that the UN rapid reaction force will escort
his convoy down the Mount Igman road or at least supply adequate armed
cover.
Dr Rutovitz was adamant that the delivery would proceed, with or
without UN protection.
It emerged yesterday that Phoenix Aid was about to step up its
delivery of supplies in Bosnia before Mr Golightly and Mr Richards were
killed.
The charity's chairman, Mr Tony Ashmore, said that six lorries which
had been trapped since June were within days of getting back on the
road.
He said the drivers, who were set to travel to Bosnia this week to man
the vehicles, had cancelled their trips and that all the charity's work
in the region had been cancelled meantime as its two remaining members
planned to return to the UK for their colleagues' funerals.
Mr Ashmore, speaking from the small organisation's headquarters in
Surrey, said: ''They are very sombre, shocked. We have a very small,
close-knit team. If you've slept in the cab of a lorry in Bosnia, brewed
tea together, you get very close.''
He said both Mr Golightly and Mr Richards were experienced in the
Bosnian situation and well used to the Mount Igman route. ''They knew
the score. They knew what to do.''

LIKE cattle to the slaughter, Croats and Muslims in northern Bosnia
have become the latest victims of the ebb and flow of an inhumane tide
of ethnic cleansing.
Hundreds have already been forced to leave their homes, been bused to
the Sava river, Bosnia's border with Croatia, put into rowing boats, and
sent into exile.
The Bosnian Serbs have begun this round-up in a programme of
systematic expulsions that aid agencies say will finally give the area
the ethnic purity the Serbs want.
Dispossessed Croats were forced to assemble in a field beside a
barracks to the north of Banja Luka, the biggest Serb-held town in
Bosnia.
Hundreds who could not board buses by the end of the day had to spend
the night in the open. A rain storm on Tuesday turned the field into an
insanitary sea of mud.
''These people have left their villages and abandoned their homes and
cannot return. The authorities are not doing anything to provide the
essentials to care for them,'' Jacques Milliano, president of the Dutch
branch of Medecins Sans Frontieres, said.
Milliano urged Serb officials to move the collection centre for the
mass expulsion, which he estimated would continue for two weeks to clear
the last of the Croats, to a building where aid organisations could care
for those leaving. Conditions for minorities gathering in Banja Luka to
be bused to Croatia were chaotic and worsening. Milliano said: ''The
transport of cattle is done better than this.
''We urgently appeal to the local authorities that if they are to
indulge in 'ethnic cleansing', which we strongly disagree with, at least
they do it with a little dignity.''
Croats and Muslims have suffered beatings, murder, and threats from a
huge influx of Krajina Serbs seeking homes and revenge for being
expelled from their rebel enclave by conquering Croatian forces. Many
are desperate to leave.
Milliano said the situation for nearly 40,000 Muslims in the region
was even worse than that of the Croats. The Croatian authorities had cut
a deal to take in their ethnic kin but no such arrangement yet existed
for Muslims, he said.
''Apparently there are some buses going to (Bosnian government-held)
central Bosnia with Muslims but it is not yet as organised as with the
Croats,'' he said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it would not assist
in the evacuation of minorities because the Bosnian Serb authorities had
not observed the terms of an agreement ensuring the safety of those
leaving.
The ICRC said it deplored the behaviour of the Bosnian Serbs and urged
them to respect ''the principle of family unity''.
There have been reports that Croat men aged below 45 were being kept
behind to work in slave labour units of the Bosnian Serb army. But a
United Nations aid agency spokesman in Sarajevo said it now appeared all
men were being allowed to go.
''Apparently an order has been given out in the Banja Luka region by
Bosnian Serb authorities to front line commanders to return men who were
doing working obligation by August 17 at the latest,'' spokesman Mark
Cutts said.

SPANISH Foreign Minister Javier Solana escaped unhurt yesterday when
at least three rounds of gunfire hit his car on a road entering the
besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
Solana, whose country holds current presidency of the European Union,
said his vehicle came under fire as it travelled from the airport to the
city centre.
''There were three or four impacts into the car,'' Solana said.
The stretch of road between Sarajevo's airport and government-held
Dobrinja is exposed and runs near front line positions of rival Serb and
Muslim-led government forces.
UN military drivers are refusing to bring relief supplies into
Sarajevo because they lack confidence in Rapid Reaction combat forces
assigned to protect them.
Around 500 British and French troops in the force, backed by
artillery, heavy mortars, and tanks, were deployed on Mount Igman, west
of Sarajevo, in July to protect peacekeepers and a perilous mountain aid
route into the city.
However, persistent Bosnian Serb fire on to the track and limits on
when the Anglo-French troops can fire back have left the only aid route
into Sarajevo as dangerous as ever.
The Belgian half of a UN transport battalion in Bosnia flatly refuses
to use the Igman road, UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko acknowledged
yesterday.
The Dutch half of the battalion reserves the right to make its
decision based on ''conditions on the ground''.
The Rapid Reaction Force says it cannot guarantee safety along the
entire length of the road but will escort aid convoys, civilian or
military, and will turn its guns on those who target the trucks.
''The road is not safe,'' said one experienced Sarajevo relief
official.
''The Rapid Reaction Force will shoot back at the Serbs if they attack
us, shoot back heavily, but our trucks will still be destroyed and some
of our drivers killed or injured.''
The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says
Sarajevo's 300,000 residents received only 20% of the food they needed
over the past three months.
''If something doesn't change we'll have to admit we can't carry out
our mandate,'' said Mr Mark Cutts, UNHCR's Sarajevo director.

BOSTON: A long-term study of more than 1600 volunteers infected with
the Aids virus has found that early treatment with the drug AZT before
the development of full-blown Aids does not help fight off the killer
disease. The study, being published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, came amid mounting evidence that AZT, also known as
zidovudine, is not as effective as once thought in keeping at bay the
onset of fatal Aids-related diseases.

VOTERS go to the polls tonight in two history-making council
by-elections.
The re-runs in Falkirk and the Borders were ordered after courts ruled
the first results in April were void because of unfranked voting papers.
In the election for the Laurmont East seat at Polmont on the new
Falkirk Council, Labour candidate Moira Fitzpatrick lost out by one vote
because two of her voting papers had not been stamped by polling station
officials.
There were four recounts before the unfranked papers were discarded,
giving victory to Tory Frank Hodge.
Mrs Fitzpatrick raised an action at Falkirk Sheriff Court calling for
the result to be overruled, and Sheriff Principal John Maguire made
history in June by ordering a re-run.
Mrs Fitzpatrick and Mr Hodge are again up for election, but the dark
horse is expected to be Independent Jim Johnston.
The SNP will be represented by Diane Williamson.
Liberal Democrat Rob McArthur, who came bottom of the first poll with
71 votes, will contest the seat again.
The Borders situation involves the new Scottish Borders Council's
Southdean ward which covers part of Jedburgh and its surrounds.
Mr Tom Dobson, who has not declared himself attached to any party,
polled 245 votes in a three-cornered fight. Mrs Patricia Miller
(Lib-Dem) was only one vote behind him. However, two ballot papers which
were found to have been unstamped were both in favour of Mrs Miller, who
raised an action in the sheriff court.
There are two other candidates in addition to Mrs Miller and Mr Dobson
-- James Brown (SNP) who won 154 votes in April, and a new contender,
Scottish Conservative Thomas Tubb.

DEAR people of Dundee, there is in your midst a theatre company of
exceptional originality and artistry. It is not a case of you being able
to see work merely on a par with what's happening in the Edinburgh arm
of the Edinburgh Fringe, these productions by the Oskaras Korsunovas
Group are so good they eclipse just about the lot of it.
Which isn't to say you're in for an easy ride. It takes a while to get
the hang of the idea that this is theatre that can be enjoyed for
itself, for its beauty, for its humour, for its visual invention -- you
don't have to make sense of it, because most of the sense has been taken
out already.
If it was a British group taking such an approach, the results would
surely be decadent, if not pretentious, yet such is the rigour of the
performances, the attention to minuscule detail, that watching this
Lithuanian company such a thought never crosses your mind.
It is choreographed with finesse without being dance, it is a joy to
look at without being visual art -- it's certainly theatre but I've
never seen anything quite like it. Inspired by the writings of Daniil
Charms, one of a group of pre-war Russian surrealists, these
performances are built on a foundation of Chaplinesque clowning, not in
an overt knockabout way, but in a manner that is subtle, refined and
artful.
Of the two plays here (the third part of the trilogy is being shown
tonight), There To Be Here is the most accessible, not just because it
is performed in English -- it makes little sense anyway -- but because
it puts visual language to the fore. The Old Woman is harder to get a
grip on, but it is rich in fascinating theatrical moments and demands to
be seen.

<HEADLINE>Expert says Lanark Blue is unsafe</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976846980</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCIENTIST said yesterday there were no definite reported cases of
food poisoning from listeria monocytogenes found in blue-veined cheeses
but added that, in his academic opinion, Lanark Blue was not safe to
eat.
Bacteriologist Dr James Bruce was giving evidence on day three of the
Lanark Blue cheese hearing at the town's sheriff court.
He said soft cheeses had been associated with listeriosis in humans
but the different varieties of semi-hard blue vein cheeses had not.
His research had discovered a report that stated two out of 20 samples
of different blue cheeses in the Netherlands were found to be
contaminated with the organism.
Dr Bruce, 55, is head of the food microbiology unit at the Scottish
Agricultural College, Auchincruive, Ayrshire, where 50 samples of Lanark
Blue were tested.
Referring to a background report given in evidence to the court, he
explained why he had included foreign reports of listeria monocytogenes.
Dr Bruce said: ''You can't give blue cheese a completely clean bill of
health.
''The fact that the organism is there leads us to this possibility
that there could be an outbreak of illness.''
Dr Bruce said all 50 samples of Lanark Blue treated at his unit were
contaminated with the organism. He said it was his academic opinion that
the Lanark Blue was not safe to eat.
There was no merit, he said, in the argument that the type of bacteria
discovered was harmless.
Dr Bruce admitted he had no detailed knowledge of how Lanark Blue was
produced from unpasteurised ewes' milk by Humphrey Errington at his farm
near Dunsyre.
The allegedly contaminated cheese, worth #27,000, has been deep frozen
at Mr Errington's farm since February.
Clydesdale District Council is seeking an order from the court to
destroy the frozen cheese because it believes it is unfit for human
consumption.
Cross-examined by Michael Jones QC, representing Mr Errington, Dr
Bruce agreed that not all strains of the bacteria caused illness.
The hearing continues.

A SCOTTISH Office decision over a controversial application to build a
200-house estate on green belt land has been delayed.
Ayrshire builder John Lynch has applied to develop the 15-acre site on
farmland between Loans and Troon.
Strathclyde Regional Council approved the proposed development in
principle, claiming the housing would satisfy local demand.
However, the application was postponed by the Scottish Office, which
claimed it would breach green belt policy.
Now, following a site visit by Scottish Office officials, a decision
is to be announced on September 4.
The development bid is opposed by many residents, who have seen much
of the farmland around Troon turned into private housing estates over
the last 20 years.
They are supported by their local Labour regional councillor, Mr
Patrick Browne, who claims Kyle and Carrick district and Strathclyde
regional councils are supporting the application against public opinion.
Councillor Browne has called for the Scottish Office to hold a public
inquiry into the controversy.
A Scottish Office spokesman said yesterday: ''Any application to build
on green belt land has to be continued for referral to the Secretary of
State.
''A decision on whether the application will be called in will be made
shortly.''

BONE marks a perplexing departure from the Clyde Unity Theatre's
previous broadly naturalistic idiom. Director and playwright, John
Binnie, seems admirably concerned to expand its commitment to putting
''ordinary Scottish characters on stage'' into a more universal and
mythical dimension.
Casting against type and gender (Rosina Bonsu plays a damaged mute boy
convincingly), an abstract multi-functional setting, and the symbolic
physicalisation of emotional states, served to distance the audience
from easy empathy.
But it's a stylistic shift which seems empty of real conviction. The
ultimately moving and disturbing picture of three characters trapped in
a circle of dependency, violence and isolation, emerges too late; victim
of a production struggling to find an effective and coherent theatrical
language.

THE first trickle of a clear strong liquid will be released today,
marking the end of a whisky drought on Arran which has lasted for more
than 160 years.
When former rugby star Gordon Brown switches on the still at the new
Isle of Arran distillery, he will be making history. The last legal
batch of whisky, considered at the time to be among Scotland's finest
malts, was made on the island around 1830.
Now the dream of former Chivas Brothers managing director Harold
Currie and his team, to restore whisky production to the island, has
become a reality and the distillery nestling in the hills outside
Lochranza is ready to begin full production.
He will be joined today by sons Andrew and Paul, now directors of the
new company, and around 450 visitors from all over the world who have
become bond holders in the new whisky, as Gordon Brown throws the switch
and Lord Lieutenant of Ayrshire and Arran, Major Richard Henderson, cuts
a tape to open the distillery.
Also among the special guests will be Lachlan McKinnon, one of whose
ancestors was the last victim of the battle between excisemen and
islanders who operated illicit stills using the famed Arran water. He
was shot on an island beach during a raid on his waterside still.
The distillery will initially employ 10 people but it is hoped to
boost that to around 50 within five years when bottling begins on the
site and a visitor centre is completed.
Mr Andrew Currie said: ''The whole project has cost in excess of #2m
and we have been helped by the selling of equity in the company and the
fantastic response to our bond scheme which gives people the opportunity
to buy 10 cases of whisky in advance.''
Whisky experts have already had a sneak preview of the spirit, which
will become Isle of Arran malt, and have declared it ''well balanced in
favourable aromas . . . with a delicate pepperyness.''

THIS is, essentially, the art of wafting. Louie Fuller mastered it
years ago, in America. Now Asako Matsui, from Japan, takes the cloth.
Once inside a variety of kimonos, her simple gestures -- quivering,
spinning, fluttering -- translate into such things as a kite flying, a
top spinning, a butterfly . . . A helpful ''menu'' at the side keeps one
right as to what is intended.
A foray into the historical saga, Genji Monogatari, brings us the
conflict between sweet Lady Aoi and her vicious rival Miyaundokoro --
good frock (white) versus bad frock (red and gold) in a thoroughly
material tussle. The black-clad minnion who scuttles on and off, picking
up her clothes, is utterly covetable as are the exquisite kimonos that
disguise the banality of this act.

TWO planned loyalist parades through a Roman Catholic area in Belfast
were called off yesterday.
Members of the Royal Black Institution, who had been due to march
along the Ormeau Road on Saturday and again the following Sunday, have
decided to stay out of the area following talks with Sir Hugh Annesley,
chief constable of the RUC.
The Rev Victor Ryan, grand master of the institution, said: ''We do
not want any confrontations.''
The decision followed serious violence on the Lower Ormeau Road last
Saturday when Roman Catholics clashed with police while protesting
against the decision to allow members of the Apprentice Boys, another
Protestant organisation, to parade through Ormeau.
About 50 members of the Black Institution had planned to parade along
the road on Sunday on their way to a church service at the Presbyterian
Assembly Hall.
Then, the following Saturday, another parade was planned.
The institution said last night it had no desire to see police
attacked again this weekend.
Sir Hugh said last night that the decision not to march was courageous
and responsible. It was, he said, ''a very significant contribution to
the general stability within the province''.
It had also significantly reduced the prospect of further conflict.

CROATIA massed troops around the historic Adriatic port city of
Dubrovnik yesterday for a showdown with Bosnian Serbs, while US envoys
briefed warring leaders in former Yugoslavia on a new peace plan.
''The Croatian army is concentrating troops and equipment in the
Dubrovnik area for a possible offensive on Trebinje to push Bosnian Serb
artillery out of range of Dubrovnik,'' said UN peacekeeping spokesman
Chris Gunness.
Dubrovnik's old Venetian walls and Renaissance-era facades were hit by
hilltop gunners in a 1991 siege during Croatia's war for independence
from Serbian-led federal Yugoslavia. The old town has not been directly
targeted recently.
However, its outskirts, including the airport, have been shelled with
renewed frequency from Serb-held Trebinje in Bosnia, nine miles inland.
The increase in tension around Dubrovnik follows Croatia's rout of
Serb rebels in its Krajina region 10 days ago, crushing the rebellion
that erupted four years ago.
The Bosnian Serb army says any shelling of the Dubrovnik area has been
a response to Croatian artillery and infantry assaults on the Trebinje
region in Serb-held Bosnia.
Gunness said more than 2000 Croatian troops had begun moving
southwards from the port of Zadar.
In fighting in west Bosnia, Croatian forces have broken through the
defences of the Serb-held town of Drvar and are on the verge of sweeping
through it.
The capture of Drvar would deal the Serbs another serious blow after
the fall of the rebel Krajina region.
Diplomats and UN officials expressed concern that a new war front
could open up while US envoys were touring the capitals of Croatia,
Serbia, and Bosnia with a new peace plan.
US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke briefed Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman yesterday and said the volatile situation
required a ''dramatic step forward''.
He plans several days of shuttle diplomacy, stopping in Belgrade
today, then Sarajevo, and then Zagreb again.
The contents of the US plan have been kept quiet.
Western diplomats said the plan uses a mixture of threats and
inducements to the warring parties in Bosnia and offers key concessions
to the Serbs if they accept.
They disclosed some key details but many elements came from previous
peace efforts which have had little success.
The plan includes possible territorial trade-offs within Bosnia and
the threat of Nato air strikes.
Washington had floated the idea of handing over Gorazde, a Muslim
enclave designated as a UN ''safe area'', to the Serbs but backed off in
the face of bitter Bosnian opposition.
Bosnian Foreign Minister Mohamed Sacirbey met Holbrooke yesterday. He
said that if the Bosnian Serbs rejected the plan, Washington would
''take over a new responsibility''. He did not elaborate.
Asked if the United States would militarily help implement the latest
plan, he replied that his talks with Holbrooke had ''revolved around all
options''.
US officials have said Bosnian Serb separatists would be locked out of
the process until they showed signs that they want to do a deal.
However, in Geneva, European Union mediator Carl Bildt, who was
heading for Sarajevo to meet Bosnian Government leaders, held talks with
Momcilo Krajisnik, a senior Bosnian Serb leader.

THE motivation behind Rubber Ear Production -- to write and perform
comedy plays with a particularly Glaswegian slant -- seems peculiarly
specific and limiting. Non-Glaswegians in the audience must have been
bemused by much of Kathleen Ruddy's script, which is firmly located in
Govan, although perhaps the nationwide popularity of Rab C Nesbitt makes
some of the references more accessible.
With a Nesbitt-like gallus gallows humour the four-hander is an
enjoyable romp. The dialogue can be too dependent on pallid pastiche but
the plot consistently holds your attention as you follow the progression
of an ingenuous scam carried out by three women. Ribald gags and sassy
performances will ensure that this will be a big success on home ground.

Strawberries may well be served off the chest of Anni Davey but it's
merely starters. Once gathered the audience's attention is hiked up
15ft. Near the ceiling of this intimate venue the four girls in tight,

ALEX LINKLATER finds it easy to become engrossed in the Book Festival
THE bitter disappointment of losing Harold Bloom and Germaine Greer
was quickly forgotten at the Book Festival as Monday kicked off to a
late but exhilarating start.
If you've never read anything Alan Spence has written since The Magic
Flute then now is the time. He tells with quiet, exact strength, stories
which scatter little pieces of transcendence across the streets of
Glasgow and commerical Japan. He is a Scottish Marathon fanatic with a
keener sense of Oriental culture than Kenneth White. His sentences have
a rhythm which was once mystical and dirtied with happy reality.
And if you're wondering how Janice Galloway has been getting on since
the conquered unhappinesses of The Trick Is To Keep Breathing and
Foreign Parts, then fear not. Her mettle is intact and fierce.
Interviewing her, Hunter Davies thought he could patronise some female
literary dabbler with his media urbanity. What he came across was
someone of considerably superior intelligence who refused to be brought
down by his fraudulent savoir-faire.
The talk which followed was a curiosity for me: I found myself
enthralled by a peculiar aristocrat talking about gardens. When I even
look at something green, it dies. But Sir Roy Strong is out there to
prove that horticulture is a craft whose history parallels all the great
artistic fashions.
So, while these people bring such a flair for the extraordinary to
jogging, anti-depressants and gardening, why is it that the most
spiritual of writers has become so bland a bletherer? On Tuesday morning
Ben Okri talked in vain, flatulent dreamtime for 40 minutes and left his
adoring audience less wise than ever.
The only serious thing he did was mention the Book Festival of 1991
when a literary conference brought together the most fabulous range of
international talent Edinburgh has seen. Okri himself was superb that
year. He spoke -- almost sang -- in perfect, spontaneous cadences of how
dream and myth can invade each living moment and offer a permanent
resolution to suffering.
This time around he forgot to mention the world. Rather than
transforming difficult reality he swam about in puddles of mysticism,
kicking up muddy clouds.
You get no spiritual quackery from William McIlvanney. His selection
of great literary influences was straight, passionately argued through
and engaging. But there was a disappointing lack of generosity when it
came to discussing younger Scottish writers, for whom he had neither
good or bad words to say. Time would sort them out.
Able to offer more objective insights into the contemporary scene was
Colm Toibin. He gave a gentler, more luminous critique. Having travelled
the border between north and south in Ireland he was well placed wittily
to point out a Protestant orthodoxy in recent Scottish writing.
However, McIlvanny had been right to warn his audience from being
seduced only by what is new. I went into the Lothian Lecture on Robert
Burns preoccupied by cutting edges, marketing strategies and millennial
fiction. But Burns came back radically fresh from the unfashionable
past. When Bill McCue sang those songs it was like hearing them for the
first time.
David Daiches's talk credited Burns with a personality, writing
techniques, and a place in both literary and folk traditions. There
wasn't a cult in sight. He gave McCue's singing a background of
intellectual magic. Daiches is Scotland's old rabbi: sceptical,
hermeneutically impassioned, joyous.

I'M beginning to believe there's too much Oprah on the Fringe, too
many autobiographical shows which are all about exposition rather than
exploration. Sancia Robinson's one-woman show is a perfect example of
this trend, showing remarkable candour which cannot fail to move but
having little dramatic virtue.
As Robinson ponders the reasons she embarked on a rigorous diet at 16
it can all seem too much like a staged spot on the psychiatrist's couch.
As she elaborates the rituals of anorexia and bulimia she adds
self-deprecating asides, clearly conscious of her delusions.
Her admission that she is still in the grips of the illness, evident
in her skeletal form, is courageous, but while the show might be
therapeutic for her it adds little to our understanding of a
much-discussed disorder.

SHOPLIFTER Clive Barratt, the first offender to be tagged under new
trials of electronic monitoring equipment, was arrested yesterday and
interviewed by police, the Home Office said.
It is believed Mr Barratt was questioned about a shoplifting offence.
The Home Office insisted that Mr Barratt's re-arrest did not mean the
trials of the equipment had failed. It had detected all his breaches of
curfew and was working well, a source said.
Baroness Blatch, Home Office Minister, told BBC Radio 4's PM
programme: ''A breach does not mean the system has failed. The system
had worked very well.''
It's worked perfectly since the start of the pilot.''
The trials were designed not just to test the equipment but also to
determine which categories of offender were the most appropriate for the
system and to give courts the chance to evaluate tagging as a sentencing
option.
The tagging equipment could not, by itself, ensure that an offender
respected a curfew order. However, breaches of curfews detected by the
equipment put offenders at risk of being brought back before the courts
and possibly jailed, she said.
Mr Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the National
Association of Probation Officers, said thta Mr Barratt's case had
demonstrated the limitations of tagging.
''The equipment is not the problem, it's the people being selected.
It's unrealistic to expect an offender characterised by previous
convictions, or an unsettled lifestyle or long-term unemployment, to
adjust to house arrest,'' he said.
So far, four offenders, including Mr Barratt, two in King's Lynn,
Norfolk, and two in Manchester, have been tagged
in just over five weeks.
The nine-month trial period, which began last month, is running in
Norfolk, Manchester, and Reading.
, and is expected to cost #1.4m.
Last week, Home Office officials insisted that the nine-month trial
was running smoothly, despite publicity over Mr Barratt, 29, from King's
Lynn, who admitted twice breaking the curfew.
It emerged that the breaches had been monitored but did not amount to
enough time to merit him being brought before the court under trial
guidelines.

GOVERNMENT moves to privatise the transport of military weapons and
explosives were described as ''absolute madness'' by opposition parties
yesterday.
The Ministry of Defence has confirmed that private hauliers are being
asked if they would be interested in bidding for contracts. Firms have
until the beginning of next week to register their interest.
The move stems from last year's Front Line First efficiency review,
which said savings of #220m could be made over the next 10 years by
leasing vehicles, using private contractors, and other modern
techniques.
Private companies are already used by the armed forces for a variety
of transport tasks, including moving dangerous naval stores and
transporting armoured vehicles, even in Bosnia.
But the move to privatisation was attacked by opposition parties, who
were quick to draw comparisons with the involvement of private firms in
the transport of prisoners, which resulted in a much-publicised series
of blunders.
Dr John Reid, Labour's spokesman on defence, said: ''This is absolute
madness. It threatens national security and public safety. At a time
when violent crime is on the increase, guns are more and more commonly
used in crimes, and terrorism is an ever-present threat, this would
present a bonanza for criminals.
''All you have to do is ask a member of the public whether they would
feel safer if their goods were protected by the British Army or by a
private security company, to get a measure of what this means.''
Dr Reid, MP for Motherwell North, added: ''The Government is doing
anything it can to cut costs. Of course, the Defence Secretary is now
Michael Portillo, who is the high priest of privatisation. This is being
driven by cost-cutting and the dogma of privatisation, irrespective of
public safety.''
For the Scottish National Party, defence spokesman Kenny MacAskill
said: ''This is another worrying step in the growing trend of
privatisation regardless of consequence.
''Transport of ammunition and explosives is a sensitive issue with
high security implications. There is no doubt that the military are best
placed to deal with the job. The dangers involved, if bullets or bombs
were to go astray, do not bear contemplating.''
Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell, MP for Fife
North-east, said the proposal was profoundly disturbing.
''Moving weapons and explosives around a densely populated country
requires great expertise and experience, which the armed services
already possess. To lose a prisoner or two, as Group Four did, is one
thing. But to hand over responsibility for such dangerous operations to
untried private companies is foolhardy.
''Too many opportunities for terrorists would be given if control of
weapons transportation does not rest strictly with the services
themselves. This is a proposal which should be abandoned immediately.''
Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence confirmed that
adverts had been placed in the trade press, seeking expressions of
interest from companies.
''We are just at the stage of seeing if anybody is interested and
capable. If any contracts are placed, it will not be until the end of
1996.''
Materials to be carried by any such contractors would include
classified freight, weapons, ammunition, and explosives -- but not
nuclear weapons, she said.
''We already employ civilian contractors on occasion to carry
explosives and ammunition. They are suitably vetted and cleared and meet
our safety standards. If we do go ahead, we would be looking for people
like that to carry out the work on a full-time basis.''
She added: ''Safety will be a paramount consideration. There will be
no relaxing of these important requirements.''
The Commons Defence Committee, of which Mr Campbell is a member, in a
report this summer on the use of civilian transport, said that there was
''no inherent reason'' why dangerous or sensitive loads should not be
transported commercially, provided safety and security requirements were
met.

THE gods of literature are on a first-name basis, and this was never
more in evidence than in Edinburgh this week when Colm, Ben and Marsha
gathered under canvas in Charlotte Square to hear the announcement of
the first winner of the SAGA prize for black British writing.
It is worth pointing out, however, that the discussion which followed
the SAGA award was nothing like the usual polite and politically correct
panel chat at such literary events.
The Irish writer Colm Toibin was in town to give a wonderful reading
from his book The Sign of the Cross, among others.
Ben Okri read from his latest publication Astonishing the Gods. Marsha
Hunt, however was here in a more entrepreneurial guise as founder of the
SAGA award itself: it went to Diran Adebayo for his Some Kind of Black.
The mechanisms of honouring (or as I find myself thinking of it,
honourizing as if it were analogous to simonizing) seem to be evolving
towards the excruciating. More and more, big literary awards are decided
at the last minute and announced and presented in real time, with the
finalists mingled sweating together, ignorant of who has won until the
moment of public declaration.
Writers are so peculiar and various that generally applicable rules of
thumb for prize-taking are hard to imagine. One might be: if you accept
a prize, accept quickly, and quickly sequester any emolument that comes
with it, because prizes can be taken away.
The Irish Literature Prize of the Irish Times and Aer Lingus was in
1991 given to and taken away from Nina FitzPatrick (for her Fables of
the Irish Intelligensia). She was unable to document to the sponsor's
satisfaction any Irish background at all and was increasingly suspected
of being a front-persona for others. She had earlier rattled the judges
by supplying for publicity purposes a photograph of a striking woman not
herself.
Another rule of thumb is: hold the thought that your prize may do good
in utterly mysterious ways, Brian Moore told me that the Japanese
novelist Kobo Abe (recently deceased) had, after reading Garcia
Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, fallen into depression and
writer's block that lasted for years. She only recovered when Marquez
won the Nobel Prize, and ''posed no further competition''.
For writers agitated at being honoured, a spectrum of postures of
diffidence is available. There is outright refusal
(Sartre/Sartre/Nobel). There is the option of accepting and denouncing
an award at the same time. (John Berger/Booker). There is also the
option of losing and thereupon denouncing the award as Peter Taylor did
when he learned that E L Doctorow was going to receive the National Book
Award for fiction in 1986 and as Salman Rushdie did when Shame failed to
get the Booker.
Finally, there is the rather opaque option of accepting an award but
refusing to be present to receive it. (Cormac McCarthy/National Book
Award). All these options are tricky, but accepting can also lead to
great personal unhappiness as the art critic, poet, novellist and
long-time anarchist pamphleteer Herbert Read discovered when he became a
Sir. His comrades -- anarchists -- heaped terrible obloquy on him.
And then, as a true limiting case, there is the fate of the ancient
Greek tyrant Draco who appeared in a stadium to accept accolades and
died suffocated in the festive avalanche of caps and cloaks.
It is too early to say how the SAGA award will affect Diran Adebayo,
but he is already contemplating the unlikely prospect of being the only
living male author to be published by Virago when Some Kind of Black
appears next summer.

FORTY teenage performers combine in this new jazz musical which uses a
bus to bring its young lovers together and to break through class
barriers. Sure, it's sentimental, like most of the best musicals.
However the real strength of Tim Norton's production lies not in its
plot but in its hordes of flapper girls, fops, and bus depot workers who
fill the stage. He has wisely concentrated on drawing out the strengths
of the ensemble's acting, singing and dancing talent, and the result
works extremely well.
There are excellent cameos from Anna Burne as Mrs Fox, a brilliantly
comic champagne Marxist, and Jeremy Cox and Daniel Benson as the
brothers of token heroine, Anna Watts. But Kate Stroud (Anna) and Ian
Colley (aristocrat hero Stephen) are more plot fuel than stars. As they
tap and flap their way through 1926, the cast members give all that they
have to building and running their very own Bus!

THE best solo shows hold you transfixed, the worst leave you feeling
like you've been trapped by the party bore.
Aussie ''comic'' Kate J was too affable to be described as boring but
her material was, a weak string of anecdotes about her father -- ''a
bloody good bloke'' -- which totally lacked cohesion.
I couldn't work out who was having a worse time; her nervousness was
palpable, finding expression in hesitant delivery and muddled jokes, and
I was simply longing for the ordeal to be over. 'Nuff said.

IT seems impossible but Susan Macfarlane has transformed the
terrifying subject of breast cancer into fine paintings which, without
avoiding reality, are both beautiful and highly accessible.
Working from drawings made on the spot over three years, she
demystifies clinical practice and procedure. The fact is she draws
extremely well; she has an eye for interesting compositions and a good
colour sense. The results are neither sentimental nor hypocritical,
rather robust affirmations that women do cope, do survive.
The catalogue (proceeds to charity) is magnificent and deserves wider
distribution. The show was first seen at London's Barbican in March to
mark International Women's Week. Its city venue is both handsome and
appropriate -- although up a lot of stairs. I went out of duty, but can
highly recommend a visit.
Till September 2.

DESPITE owing obvious debts to John Shuttleworth and Harry Hill -- not
to mention Sir Dickie Attenbugler -- Sir Bernard is still a singular
comic creature.
In his day he has been an actor, a raconteur, and a man about town.
Nowadays he's mostly a chuntering theatre-bore and connoisseur of
hardcore pornography, as well as being a raddled pederast and a sufferer
from Tourette's Syndrome. Or is he chiefly a tubby bald bloke with a wig
made from orange carpet? Only Sir Bernard's assistants, Matt Lucas and
David Walliams, know for sure.
Whatever or whoever Sir Bernard is, you owe it to yourself to go along
and decide.

THE pairing of McNeill, one of our most prolific tunesmiths, and
McManus, a guitarist of superlative arranging and interpretative skills,
fulfilled all expectations.
Swapping their instruments good-o, McNeill playing fiddle, concertina,
cittern, bouzouki and guitar in short order, they hit us with steel-hard
reels, intricately skewiff waltzes, a beautiful slow air inspired by a
thoroughly unprepossessing bloke, and painstakingly written songs.
Singing, admittedly, is not their strongest suit, although McNeill
makes up for uncertainty of pitch with passion and urgency. The songs,
too, were variable, the pick being Any Mick'll Do, a devastating tirade
against bigotry, which with the equally tough No Gods and a high voltage
set with McNeill's fellow former Battlefield Bander, piper Dougie
Pincock, sent us reeling into the night.

BARGAIN hunters turned out in force yesterday to bid for repossessed
homes and commercial premises put up for sale by building societies and
other mortgagers.
It was standing room only in a suite in an Edinburgh hotel when about
200 people attended the General Accident Property Services auction,
offering properties in Strathclyde, Lothian, Tayside, Highlands,
Grampian, Fife, Central, Borders, and the Western Isles.
One bidder walked off with a studio flat in Kinghorn for #6000.
Another bought a second-floor, one-bedroom flat in Kinlochleven for
#7500. A six-bedroom detached stone-built villa in Dysart went for
#45,000. A substantial villa in Wanlockhead, with four bedrooms, garage,
and gardens, which was put up by the Halifax, was sold at #21,500.
Other sales included a two-bedroom flat in Dunoon for #13,000, a
four-bedroom, end- terrace stone house in Coatbridge for #37,000, and a
five-room, first-floor tenement flat in Edinburgh for #33,250.
Nine properties were withdrawn from auction when bidding failed to
match their reserve prices.
Originally more than 50 properties were due to come under the hammer
but more than 20 were removed from the list after either private deals
were concluded or in the case of a few they were withdrawn.
At the end of the business, 80% of properties on the original list
were sold, which the auctioneer, Mr Colin Wilton-Smith of GA Property
Services, described as ''very satisfactory in today's market''.
He said properties that had failed to attract high enough bids might
be sold very quickly in post-auction negotiations.
He said: ''We have now seen auction sales of this sort in Scotland for
four years. At one time, it was thought by some people that there was no
need for auctions under the Scottish system. I think people now
recognise that it does have something to offer as a way of selling.''

THE trouble with self-mockery is, it's apt to backfire. Take Burach,
the Gaelic word for, apparently, ''shambles'', which sadly describes a
significant proportion of this gig.
Much of the blame lies with Venue B's acoustics, which the moment they
spot a drum kit start cooking pea soup. Songs? Forget it. Not that,
beyond hinting at what the Jefferson Airplane might have sounded like
had they come from Methil, these sounded very interesting. But without
hearing a single word, who, in fairness, could tell?
This and a verbal diarrhoeic frontman aside, Burach justify some of
the current brouhaha as a kerosene-driven ceilidh band, with skill in
the accordion-fiddle front-line and a rhythm section which gives
''strict tempo'' an almost combative resonance.

LULU Wong Taylor's paintings are full of her own energy and love of
life.
Mostly of her native Borneo, the works are often larger than life and
painted in two dimensions, but this only emphasises the sheer size,
fruitfulness and power of the rainforest and jungle, underlined by
frequent use of favourite images -- the Rhinoceros Hornbill, and Bird of
Paradise, lilies and papaya and lime green bananas, people fishing from
canoes and living in houses on stilts.
Emotional and strangely compelling, they draw your eye into more and
more detail so that, although at first glance the paintings appear
rather naive, you do become enthralled and absorbed by the strong
colours and subjects of this artist's world.
Until September 2.

PALLY Sarf Landahn hard-boy-with-a-heart Kevin offers many acerbic
thoughts on the nineteen-fifties Ealing monochrome comedy into which
this Tory Government of ours has somehow mutated.
Not many stand-ups mock our bumbling overseers these days, evidently
feeling that having a joke for a Prime Minister makes political satire
redundant.
Full marks to our Kev for his persistence then. And for having enough
insight, ire and imagination to wring fresh laughter from old targets
like Norman Tebbit and William Waldegrave. He also taught me something I
should, as a fellow leftie, have known: that the National Front have
become the National Democrats.
When we all person the revolutionary barricades, Kevin Day's the chap
to have at our shoulders.

AT this impatient time of year you tend to get twitchy at anything
longer than a soundbite, but this curious two-hander by the Exacting
Company left me wanting more.
Based on a real incident 10 years ago when a man imprisoned his wife
in a shelter in their back garden on the pretext that war had broken
out, Candy Deceit is a devided piece that wants to talk not just about
mental illness, but also about power politics in the home and in the
wider world outside.
As it stands, though, this is but a sketch waiting for such themes to
be explored in greater detail. Lacking psychological depth, it actually
succeeds in making the story less explicable than did the newspaper
report.

<HEADLINE>Extra allowance plea for medical students</HEADLINE>

MEDICAL students are accumulating so much debt to see them through
their studies that they should receive a special allowance to ease their
financial burdens, the British Medical Association said yesterday.
According to the latest annual BMA survey of student finances, medical
undergraduates are running up an average debt of #3696 each, nearly 30%
higher than last year.
The sum includes Government student loans, overdrafts, and bank loans.
The increase in debt is partly explained by the residual carry-over of
debt from the previous year.
Debt levels will increase further as the Government's policy of
reducing the amount of maintenance grant and making up the difference by
increasing the value of student loans is implemented.
Medicine is an expensive undergraduate course because of the longer
time it takes to gain a degree, five or six years against four for an
honours degree in Scotland.
The BMA said medical students were at a further disadvantage because
they had shorter holidays, which meant they had neither the same
opportunities nor time as arts or science students to work in the
summer.
In their fifth year medical students must undertake clinical work in
hospital, which means they receive only about four weeks' holiday in the
summer.
Where jobs are available, other students can work to pay off
overdrafts and save money for the next session.
Dr Brian Potter, Scottish secretary of the BMA, called on the
Government to give medical students a special allowance to take account
of these and other factors.
He said medical students must also buy expensive textbooks and
equipment and raise funds for their electives, when they study and work
abroad.
Experts estimate that more medical students will be needed to meet the
demand for more doctors into the next century and, said Dr Potter: ''We
would be concerned if the high cost of a medical education deterred
bright and committed youngsters from pursuing a medical education.''
Philippa Leaman, a final year medical student at Edinburgh University,
said yesterday that she went into debt mainly to support herself in her
clinical years, when she received only four weeks' holiday in the
summer, an insufficient amount of time for her to secure a job and help
pay off her overdraught.
She said that, by the time she qualifies, she will have acquired
several thousand pounds worth of debt between a professional studies
loan from the bank and student loans.
''I do not like being in debt and I believe there should be extra
funds for medical students,'' she said.
Although medical students receive a small amount of extra grant money
to take account of the duration of their courses, there are no such
allowances in the student loan scheme.
Mr Rupert Gauntless, chairman of the BMA's medical students'
committee, said: ''The Government's student support package, whether in
the form of grants or loans, does not provide enough money.
* The list of degree courses on which vacancies exist for entry this
autumn, supplied to The Herald and published in yesterday's editions,
omitted details of 13 courses offered by Dundee University.
These are: BEng Electronics and Electrical Engineering; BEng
Electrical Engineering with Microcomputer Systems; BEng Electronic
Engineering with Management; BEng Electronic Engineering and Physics;
BEng Mechanical Engineering; BEng Manufacturing Engineering and
Management; BAcc Accounting; BFin Finance; BSc Town and Regional
Planning; BSc Environmental Management; MA Food and Welfare Studies; MA
Hotel and Catering Management; and BSc/BArch Architecture.
The remaining lists of vacancies will be published on August 23 and
30.

IN analysing economic trends the Treasury and Bank of England review a
wide range of official statistics, some published monthly, such as
retail sales. Others are published quarterly, such as those for gross
domestic product.
The authorities also examine survey evidence, much of it from the
Confederation of British Industry and the Halifax and Nationwide
Building Societies which monitor house prices. Often this is
conflicting, leading to differing views on the conduct of monetary
policy (mainly interest rates) and fiscal policy (taxes and public
sector borrowing).
Some statistics take longer to compile than others. The industrial
production figures, published last week, were for June, while
yesterday's retail sales, unemployment, and the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement figures relate to July. The biggest time lag occurs with the
global figures for visible trade. Latest data here, published on August
2, cover May.
One problem with statistics is that they are often revised as more
information becomes available. The retail price index (the July figures
are due today) is an honourable exception.
GDP figures, which cover the total output of the economy, are often
revised several times, and upward revisions have played an important
part in decisions to raise interest rates. The following are the main
activity indicators:
GDP: A provisional estimate of GDP in the second quarter was published
on July 21. This showed that total GDP grew by 0.6% in the quarter, a
little lower than the first quarter's 0.7%. GDP growth peaked at 1.4% in
the second quarter of last year and has been slowing down since.
But if oil and gas extraction is excluded, onshore growth picked up
from 0.6% in the first quarter to 0.7%. These figures could be revised
on Monday when the Central Statistical Office publishes a more detailed
analysis of output, income, and expenditure.
Whereas the GDP measure is the most important indicator of economic
activity, figures on retail sales, unemployment, and industrial
production provide more detailed and up-to-date information.
The retail sales and unemployment figures for July, published
yesterday, give the first indications of how the economy has performed
in the third quarter, which has already run half its course. Typically
the indications were contradictory.
RETAIL SALES sales were relatively strong, mainly because the fine
weather led to a big jump in sales of clothing and footwear. Between
June and July the volume of sales increased by 0.4% to a record monthly
level.
In the latest three months sales were 0.7% higher than in the previous
three months, suggesting that the consumer may be coming back to life
after a long period when he has been held in check by increased taxes,
higher interest rates, and modest growth in earnings.
Sales were particularly weak in the last quarter of 1994 and the first
quarter of this year. This is the main reason why the July figure is
only 1.4% higher than the same month last year. In fact the latest
figures show that sales did not surpass last September's level until
June.
UNEMPLOYMENT: The 1700 increase in seasonally adjusted unemployment
last month to 2,315,300 was the first rise since August 1993. This was
well signalled by the June figures showing a monthly increase of just
4200, now revised down to 3800.
Unemployment fell rapidly in the second half of last year. The average
monthly fall in the third quarter of last year was 27,700 and in the
final quarter 47,900.
This slowed to 23,900 in the first quarter of this year and just
11,100 in the second quarter. The labour market reforms of the Thatcher
years have made unemployment more sensitive to changes in the pace of
economic activity.
The recent trend in unemployment provides confirmation that the
economy is slowing down, but at this stage it is not clear whether the
increase last month is a blip or the start of a trend, ending a period
of two-and-years when the underlying trend was declining.
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION: The other important activity indicator is
industrial production. The latest figures for June show that production
dropped by 0.4%, mainly because of a sharp fall in oil and gas output
due to maintenance work in the North Sea.
However, the manufacturing constituent rose by 0.2%, and there were
significant upward revisions to previously published figures. As a
result industrial production grew by 0.1% in the second quarter and
manufacturing by 0.5%. In the first quarter industrial production grew
by 1% but manufacturing dropped by 0.1%.
Undoubtedly there has been a slowdown. In the middle of last year
manufacturing was growing at around 5% per annum and industrial
production by 6%. The latest year-on-year growth rates are 2.3% in
manufacturing and 1.8% in industrial production.
All these monthly output figures do not cover the service sector of
the economy, other than retail sales. This is a major weakness, but the
Central Statistical Office is examining the possibility of publishing
monthly GDP figures to overcome this deficiency.
INFLATION: The other side of the coin is inflation. Britain has had a
very bad record in this regard in the last 20 years. As a result
recessions have been deeper and longer than in most other countries.
After Britain was forced to leave Europe's exchange rate mechanism in
September 1992, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, set
an inflation target and appointed the Bank of England to monitor it.
The target is to keep underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage
interest payments, in a range of 1% to 4% and to reduce it to 2.5% or
less by the end of the current Parliament in the spring of 1997.
The latest inflation figures for June show that underlying inflation
was 2.8%, a little higher than May's 2.7%. The trend has been upwards
from a level of 2% in September and October of last year.
Headline inflation was 3.5% in June and the new RPIY measure, favoured
by the Bank of England, which excludes indirect and local authority
taxes as well as mortgage interest, was 2.3%.
PRODUCER PRICES. A key inflation indicator is given by the monthly
producer price figures, which cover industry's input, or fuel and
materials, costs and output, or factory gate, prices for manufactured
goods.
The July figures, published on Monday, showed a seasonally adjusted
rise in input prices of 0.5% to 10.3%, a little lower than June's 10.4%.
Fuel and materials costs have been rising sharply on the back of last
year's upsurge in commodity prices and this year's fall in the value of
sterling. But they only account for about 8% of industrial costs.
Inflation at the factory gate is also higher than at the retail level.
The main measure of factory gate price inflation rose by 0.2% in July
and the annual rate climbed from 4.2% to 4.5%, its highest level since
August 1991.
But the core measure, which excludes the food, beverages, tobacco, and
petroleum industries, rose by 0.4% on the month taking the annual rate
up to 5% from 4.8%. The July rate was the highest since May 1991.
The producer prices suggest that there is more inflation in the
pipeline.AVERAGE EARNING: The most important element in manufacturers'
costs is the cost of labour. The average earnings figures, accompanying
yesterday's unemployment figures, were encouraging. The May figure was
revised down to 3.5% from 3.75% and the June figure was also 3.5%.
The growth in unit labour costs slowed slightly from 2.8% in May to
2.2% in June. Gone, however, are the days when manufacturing
productivity was growing so rapidly that industry was actually enjoyed
the benefits of negative growth in labour costs.

THIS version of the bedtime story goes better with an Irish coffee
than a mug of cocoa. A stunning script from Chris Scott which won him
Peter Shaffer's prize, twists through the forests of nursery rhyme,
proverb and advertising jingle, before finally arriving at Grandma's
house.
A strong cast, fronted by Jasmine Hyde as Petunia and Peter Forshaw as
Ian manages the slides out of the predictable to perfection as
fairy-tale unites with the fantasies of the 1990s.
Hyde dominates the shifting faces of the play's scarlet woman, helped
by excellent direction from fellow Oxford undergraduate, Izzy Mant. The
dreams left by this production are not sweet, but sleep will be the
poorer without them.

UNTIL last year regular monthly meetings between the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England were conducted in
secret and the public at large had no idea what went on. Decisions to
change interest rates were signalled by the Bank of England through its
money market operations.
The present Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, the canny Ken of the twosome
with Steady Eddie (George), decided to publish the minutes of the
monthly monetary meetings six weeks in arrears.
A year-and-a-half earlier this would have been virtually impossible
with the authorities often having to take panic action in response to
adverse movements in sterling.
The classic example of this was on the so-called Black Wednesday when
rates were changed four times in 24 hours in a vain attempt to keep
sterling within Europe's exchange rate mechanism. Base rates were raised
by 2% to 12% in the morning, and then by a further 3% after lunch to
15%. But the pound had lost its battle.
In the evening Norman Lamont suspended it from membership of the ERM
and cut rates back to 12%. The following morning they were back to
square one at 10%. The pound was floating freely on the foreign exchange
markets and by January 1993 base rates had been reduced to 6% after a
succession of one-point cuts. Sterling never rejoined the ERM.
Most of the time the Treasury and the Bank of England are in agreement
on monetary policy, though the present rift over interest rates is
almost certainly not the first since Mr Clarke went to No 11.
In February 1994 base rates were reduced by 0.25% to 5.25%. The move
was badly received by the financial markets which suspected that the
Bank of England had opposed a proposal from Mr Clarke to cut rates by
0.5%. At the time the economy was beginning to grow quite rapidly, and
the two factions compromised on a quarter-point cut.
When the minutes of the meeting were published they seemed to suggest
that the markets had been correct in their interpretation. Seven months
later Mr George pressed Mr Clarke to raise rates by half a point.
The Chancellor asked for 48 hours to consider the matter. He
eventually agreed, but as a result the markets were wrong-footed by the
delay. The increase came through after traders in the City had concluded
that the two men had decided to stay their hands.
Interest rates were again raised in December and in February, on both
occasions by half a point, taking base rates back up to 6.75%. There was
no disagreement on either occasion, and the markets were signalled
immediately in order to avoid the confusion that had arisen with the
September increase.
When the two men fell out in May the Chancellor called a press
briefing at the Treasury to explain that he had decided not to raise
rates. The Bank of England remained tight-lipped, but City speculation
that there had been a disagreement was confirmed by the publication of
the minutes halfway through June.
At the time independent economists in the City were overwhelmingly in
favour of raising rates, and sterling fell sharply in response to the
Chancellor's insistence on no change.
The official position is that the Chancellor has the final say on
whether rates should be raised (or reduced), but the timing of any
change is a matter for the Governor.
In practice the authorities in the UK (and the US) have followed the
Bundesbank in immediately transmitting changes to the markets.
Since May, Mr Clarke and Mr George have met three times, once in June
and twice in July. The minutes for the first two meetings, which have
been published, show that the Governor has continued to insist that
higher rates were needed if the Government was to achieve its objective
of reducing underlying inflation, currently 2.8%, to 2.5% or less by the
spring of 1997 when the present Parliament must come to an end.
However, the minutes for the July 7 meeting suggested that the
Governor was toning down his demands in recognition of the growing
evidence that the economy was slowing down to around its trend rate of
growth.
Since they first fell out over the need for a rise in rates both have
been keen to emphasise that the decision was finely based. The Bank of
England is the nation's inflation watchdog, and its quarterly inflation
reports in May and August both showed that the inflation target,
recently confirmed by the Chancellor, would be missed. This has left Mr
George with little or no choice in the advice he has offered at the
monthly meetings.
The Chancellor of course is a highly political animal and he has been
concerned about the absence of a feel good factor despite three years of
economic growth and the weakness of the housing market.
Events seem to be proving him right at least for the time being. Not
only has the economy slowed down, but also the pound has begun to stage
a moderate recovery on the back of a resilient dollar. This may give the
Governor the opportunity to change horses in mid-stream.

THE world's first ocean-based wave power electricity generator has
been towed away for repairs two weeks after being launched.
The #4m Osprey (Ocean Swell Powered Renewable Energy) was developed
over five years by Applied Research and Technology in Inverness.
ART's managing director, Mr Allan Thomson, hoped it was only a
temporary setback. The company intends to assess and repair the damage.
Osprey is intended to generate electricity while ballasted to the
sea-bed by sucking in wave swells which causes rising air to power
turbines in two funnels.

MOBILE phone operator Cellnet has promised to review its emergency
safeguards following a shutdown of the service in Scotland earlier this
year.
The regulatory body, Oftel, decided to investigate after the phone
system was closed down without warning in May.
In a recent letter to Oftel, Cellnet said it was investigating
internal procedures.
A spokesman for the company said last night that some improvements,
such as better internal communications, had already been introduced.
He added that the company would listen to any future advice from
Oftel. He said: ''We want to make sure that our maintenance procedures
are so tight that it is very rare for failures to occur. Investigations
into internal procedures are on-going.
''We work closely with Oftel and are happy to respond to any advice
they may give in the future.''
Cellnet, which has around 100,000 customers in Scotland, blamed
equipment failure work for the five-hour shutdown.
In a letter to Labour trade and industry spokesman Brian Wilson, the
director general of Oftel, Mr Don Cruickshank, said it was doubtful that
the shutdown amounted to a licence contravention.
Cunninghame North MP Mr Wilson called for the investigation and a
stricter code of practice governing network operators.
Thousands of calls were lost, including one to a Glasgow doctor who
said the death of a patient may have been caused by the shutdown. In
that case, the Glasgow patient, Ruby McCowan, 74, could not connect with
a emergency answering service.
Mr Cruickshank said: ''Calls made directly to a medical answering
service, as opposed to 999 calls, are not strictly speaking calls to a
public emergency calls service as defined in the licence.''
Mr Wilson gave a cautious welcome to the results of the Oftel
investigation but said it could have gone further and recommended that
all customers should be informed of any shutdown.
He added: ''As mobile phones become ever more widespread, the public
will reasonably expect high standards of reliability, including access
to emergency services.''

The woman . . . whose life was saved by a catheter and bent coathanger
-- does not know how lucky she was
That long-awaited summer break might not be good for you.
Dr ANNE PETTIGREW
explains the pitfalls
HOLIDAYS can make you sick. The Department of Health issues a useful
leaflet on how to avoid most of the problems overseas travellers risk,
such as diarrhoea or malaria. It doesn't however mention one other
important thing. If you are feeling ill before you get on a plane, don't
get on the plane.
I've now been involved in four mid-air medical dramas over the past
few years. My heart sinks when the call goes out -- ''If there is a
doctor or nurse on board will they please make themselves known to the
cabin staff''.
I suspect many doctors wait until the call has been issued a few times
before volunteering in the hope that someone more qualified will come
forward. Sadly, reluctance may be gaining ground with the increase in
litigation for alleged medical negligence during Good Samaritan
missions. No cases have been successful in the UK but apparently they
are commonplace in Texas and Maryland in the US. British doctors' normal
insurance cover is invalid in North America.
It's a nightmare trying to diagnose and treat someone when crouched
between seats in a plane. Collapsed patients often seem to be travelling
alone and semi-conscious. There is no diagnostic medical equipment and
the first aid supplies available involve so much paperwork if used that
members of the aircrew are reluctant to do so unless they contain
something you are absolutely sure you need.
This year's elderly lady was vague, confused and passed out when they
tried to sit her up. My partner in this drama was an English paediatric
anaesthetist who hadn't treated an adult for years. The patient could
give no clues, nor did her handbag.
Fortunately she had chatted to her fellow travellers. She was diabetic
and hadn't eaten lunch. Low blood sugar was a possibility. She wasn't
fit to drink lemonade or eat biscuits and we didn't have any of the
injections we'd usually use. We were able to pour sugar packets into her
mouth and she did recover well.
All the patients I've seen -- heart attack, bowel obstruction,
blackout and the diabetic lady -- were feeling unwell before travelling.
If only they'd known how difficult it is to help them in-flight they
would have thought twice before taking to the air. The woman with
fractured ribs from a road accident before boarding -- whose life was
saved by a catheter and bent coathanger -- does not know how lucky she
was that an orthopaedic professor was on board.
Many doctors, like me, do not have specialist knowledge enabling them
to help in this way and some doctors I've assisted in the air are
retired or, in the case of one Australian pathologist, don't see live
patients normally.
Travelling in planes has a profound metabolic effect on your body.
It's subjected to pressurisation, immobility and dehydration. If you are
already sick, you'll get sicker. Don't go! It would certainly solve my
dilemma at proferring my humble services. But even if my conscience
would let me sit quietly, ignoring the call, I could risk someone
reporting me to the General Medical Council for dereliction of duty.
The alternative risk of being sued is just one cross doctors have to
bear. Virgin Airways must be the only airline to start appreciating
this. I returned home to my first thank-you letter and a Fortnum's
hamper with champagne. Virgin's staff too appeared more sensible and
better trained at keeping calm in an emergency. Other airlines please
note.

ANIMAL protection officers yesterday were beginning the painstaking
task of identifying more than 500 specimens found in a raid on the home
of a taxidermist.
Police and Customs officers went to the house in Newtown, Powys, on
Tuesday, as part of an investigation into an international smuggling
ring.
The find, worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, included specimens
and remains from some of the world's rarest animals.
The prize find of the investigators, who worked with the Royal Society
for the Protection of Birds and the World Wide Fund for Nature, was the
skull of a monkey-eating Philippine eagle.
Ms Joan Childs, an RSPB investigating officer on the raid, said the
detached house was crammed with specimens.
A 40-year-old Dutchman was arrested at his home in Newtown on Tuesday,
and released on police bail for six weeks.

UNEMPLOYMENT rose in the UK for the first time in two years, with
young people bearing the brunt of the rise.
The Government, fearful that the figures would be seized upon as an
indication that economic recovery was faltering, blamed the increase on
the normal rise and fall of students entering the jobs market for the
first time.
The jobless total in Scotland was also up, but Scottish Office
Agricultural Minister Lord Lindsay -- the duty minister while Industry
Minister George Kynoch is on holiday -- repeated the argument that the
rise was the usual July surge caused by the end of the academic year.
He said he remained confident there would be further reductions in
unemployment in the coming months.
Scottish National Party MP Roseanna Cunningham accused Lord Lindsay of
appalling complacency. ''He refused to take part in radio interviews on
the unemployment figures, which suggests that he has about as much
confidence in the Tories' policies as the rest of us do,'' she said.
In the UK, the total claiming unemployment benefit rose by 1700 to
2,315,300 -- the first increase since August 1993. In Scotland, the jump
was 400 to 198,400, or 8% of the population. That is in what is called
the adjusted total, which takes into account seasonal variations. The
unadjusted Scottish figure, which is not regarded as such a good
indicator, leapt by more than 16,000.
It is the age breakdown which shows that young people are suffering
the most. Among 20 to 24-year olds in Scotland, unemployment is up 4.3%
on the previous quarter, while those over 24 have actually seen slight
decreases.
The white-collar union MSF said its research showed little chance of
an improvement for young people. Scottish regional officer Willie Gibson
said yesterday that as an example all the major insurance and assurance
companies had been contacted, but almost all said that they had a freeze
on recruitment.
In manufacturing, the number of apprentices was also down, he added.
As expected, opposition MPs seized upon the figures to berate the
Government's economic policies -- particularly Labour which is keen to
deflect attention from its own internal arguments over Tony Blair's
leadership of the party.
As employment spokesman Ian McCartney colourfully put it: ''They
indicate that the Government's much vaunted economic recovery is no more
than a dead fat cat's bounce.''
He added: ''A rise in the claimant count of 1700 forces many more into
the uncaring, cynical clutches of Social Security Secretary Peter
Lilley. Increases in poverty and distress will follow these figures as
surely as night follows day.''
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said: ''This is the
greatest conceivable indictment of Conservative economic policies.
''It is the final nail in the coffin of a sustained recovery, both for
the economy and for the Government's own electoral fortunes. Insecurity
has spread like a plague across every part of the UK and is holding back
any prospect of lasting economic recovery.''
Trade union organisations used the rising figures to press the
Government for a change in policies. Scottish TUC general secretary
Campbell Christie said the Chancellor should cut interest rates to boost
industrial investment and halt the jobs slide. He further suggested that
the Government should boost public spending on infrastructure
improvements and other labour intensive schemes.
Even the employers' organisation, the Confederation of British
Industry, said the rise was disappointing. Lex Gold, the director of CBI
Scotland, said it was not clear if it was merely a blip or a reversal of
the trend of lower figures, adding that it would be foolish to be
complacent.
Labour also highlighted the rises in unemployment in the
constituencies of Cabinet Ministers since John Major became Prime
Minister. Two Government Ministers, John Gummer and Sir Patrick Mayhew,
saw increases of more than 100% in their constituencies.
However, the three Scottish-based Cabinet Ministers -- Malcolm
Rifkind, Ian Lang and Michael Forsyth -- were at the bottom of the list,
indicating that unemployment in Scotland has not gone through the peaks
and troughs experienced in the South of England.

THE debate about the current state of the economy is becoming almost
theological in flavour. I don't mean by that that the core question of
the moment -- Is Britain's economic recovery fast running out of steam?
-- rivals the existence or otherwise of a deity in philosophical
significance.
But I do mean that taking a stance on this long-running economic
conundrum depends as much on blind faith as it does on any objective
evidence for or against the Government's insistence that, despite the
occasional statistical blip, like yesterday's rise in unemployment, the
recovery remains broadly on course.
Economic recovery means so many different things to different people.
For the factory manager it means fat order books and good margins. For
the corner store and the publican it means more people walking through
the door and spending more money. For the unemployed it means a rich
array of situations vacant.
For shareholders it means improved profits, a rising share price and
fatter dividends from invested companies. For the Highland bed and
breakfast it means not one empty bed night between May and September.
For homeowners surveying houses worth thousands less than they paid for
them, it means lots of eager buyers pushing prices back skywards.
For a lot of workers it probably still means winning a pay rise which
doesn't fall short of inflation, although a surer sense of job security
would probably run a close second. For a lot of suppliers, forced for
the past couple of years to absorb raw material price increases, it
would be the opportunity to pass on price increases of their own to
customers and make these rises stick.
While all these groups measure their economic well-being in hard cash
in one form or another, their outlook is also dictated by more
qualitative factors like mood and confidence. And that mood -- summed up
recently in the absence of the elusive feel-good factor -- helps dictate
myriad individual actions which have a collective knock-on effect in the
economy as a whole.
But for those in the Treasury and the Bank of England who are supposed
to run our economy -- and the small armies of analysts and forecasters
in the City who shadow their every move -- economic recovery is boiled
down to a small set of official numerical indicators whose
inter-relationships determine which levers to pull, whether to hold
course or change tack.
Since Britain emerged from seven successive quarters of measurable
economic decline in 1992, a number of these measures have been moving in
directions which, together, painted a benign picture last seen in the UK
economy of the 1960s. Low inflation, falling unemployment, strong output
growth, rising exports -- what the deputy prime minister Michael
Heseltine has dubbed the golden scenario.
But, like an unfinished paint-by-numbers canvas, there were gaps in
the pleasing picture. Consumers remained stubbornly reluctant to spend
money in the shops. The housing market, despite the occasional glimmer
of activity, remained in the doldrums. Many workers who kept their jobs
saw their relationships with employers casualised in ways which sowed
new uncertainties.
While exporters, boosted by a depreciating sterling after our
ignominious exit from the ERM, were enjoying an overseas order boom, the
mood in the domestic economy -- the tone no official indicator can pick
up -- has remained fractious and uncertain.
Perversely that downbeat mood has been reinforced by the Government's
determination to slay a long-lived economic dragon, rampant inflation.
For as long as UK Governments were soft on inflation, we could rely on
the nominal value of our homes rising. We could justify submitting
substantial pay claims. And we could enjoy fat interest rates on our
savings too.
No matter that some of these gains were illusory. Living with
inflation seemed more comforting, less exposed than living with the
retail price index under 2%, as it was throughout 1993. Even with the
rate at 3.5%, as it was in June, the discomfort persists.
And now some of the other indicators in Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine's golden scenario seem to running adrift. The July rise in the
unemployed claimant count, the first in 22 months, was predictably
seized on by the opposition parties yesterday as proof positive that the
tide has turned and that grimmer days lie ahead.
The rise had been foreshadowed in the June jobless figures, when, on
the alternative standard international measure, UK unemployment actually
rose. And even on the Government's preferred claimant measure the rate
of improvement has been slowing in recent months.
Output growth has been slowing. And, even on the export front, the
distinct improvement in Britain's trade deficit in the first three
months of this year has started to unwind, thanks to falling export
volumes. Surveys of business opinion are noticeably less bullish than
they were earlier in the year. The recovery hasn't yet stalled, but,
like a runner who has miscalculated how many laps remain in the race, it
seems to be fighting harder for breath.
And that poses a significant political problem for ministers. The Bank
of England is still insisting that rising price pressures at the
producer end of the chain threaten the Government's target of 2.5%
retail inflation by the end of this Parliament. It wants another rise in
interest rates to keep the beast caged.
However, another rise in interest rates, particularly if it is
translated into higher mortgage payments, will further knock the fragile
mood in the domestic economy. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke clearly
recognises the political dangers in that. But, assuming he continues to
resist the siren voices advocating a softer line on inflation on the one
hand and Bank of England Governor Eddie George on the other, his room
for manoeuvre is small.
It is not yet checkmate. But the squares around him are filling fast.

* WHAT we eat affects the way we look, the way we feel and our energy
levels. However, nutrition is rarely taken seriously, yet it can be the
cornerstone of health or a trigger for disease.
A series of short courses on nutrition will be held this autumn in
Aberdeen (September 2 and 9), Dundee (October 7 and 11), and Glasgow
(October 21 and November 4).
The seminars are organised by nutritionist Dr Chris Fenn over two
Saturdays and involve the tasting of specialist foods currently on the
market. Dr Fenn's short courses are likely to be of particular interest
to reflexologists, massage therapists and complementary health
practitioners.
Course fee #85. Contact Dr Chris Fenn, 19 Craigton Court, Aberdeen AB1
7PF. Or ring 01224 316814 for more information.
* MOST children will grow out of their asthma, something that many
mothers already know. A study carried out at Aberdeen, led by Dr James
Friend, shows that asthma attacks in very young children are often
triggered by viral infections such as the common cold. The study shows
that there is often a good recovery rate in later years from this type
of asthma.
A similar study conducted at City Hospital in Nottingham, concluded
that wheezing in 85% of children was resolved by 16 years of age.
* MEN who are reluctant to go to their GP may prefer in the first
instance to call the NHS Helpline 0800 224488, any weekday between 9am
and 5pm. There are leaflets available on topics such as cancer of the
prostate, heartburn, hiatus hernia and sexually transmitted diseases.
* HAVING a partner who snores heavily not only upsets your own sleep
but puts his or her own health in danger too. Now Scotland's first
private snore clinic, Silent Partners, opens in Glasgow. Based in the
Bon Secours hospital, this innovative project reflects the depth of the
snoring problem that affects almost half the adult population over 40
years of age, and is an all too common cause of marital disharmony. For
further information ring Freephone: 0800 506507.
* THE herb, feverfew, has long been associated with helping the
prevention of migraine headaches. Now new research published in the
Pharmaceutical Journal suggest it can provide relief from rheumatism and
arthritis too. Herbal Laboratories says it is not surprised. For years
it has received anecdotal evidence and unsolicited testimonials from
people who have obtained relief from these common complaints after using
their feverfew tablets.

THE rebel World Rugby Corporation, fronted by Australian Ross Turnbull

domination of the world game and not just the formation of a
professional global tournament, according to confidential documents
obtained by The Herald.
Yesterday, after developments in Australia and New Zealand, where test
players seemed likely to join their South African counterparts and sign
contracts with the traditional unions, the bold coup attempt by WRC
seemed on the brink of collapse -- something Mr Turnbull has denied.
However, the scale of the WRC proposals contained in its ''private and
confidential'' prospectus amounted to an attempt to stage a revolution
in the world game.
Once WRC had signed up more than 1000 of the world's top players to
play in a series of regional games and a world series, in addition to
traditional meetings like the Five Nations' tournament and the Bledisloe
Cup between New Zealand and Australia, WRC would have become the
controlling body and would have offered franchises to traditional
administrators like the SRU.
The document is unclear on whether unions would have had to pay for
the privilege of, essentially, maintaining the status quo but, as the
whole WRC concept is so commercially orientated, there is a strong
possibility that they would.
If the coup had been successful, this would have raised the
possibility of the traditional unions negotiating with WRC to hire back
''their'' players and, if agreement could not be reached, of unions
fielding third or fourth-string international teams in tournaments such
as the Five Nations.
The WRC plan was obviously to destabilise the game by enticing the
players away from the traditional unions and placing them under
contract. The fact that this was the case is underlined by the
declaration: ''WRC's vision will only be realised if the players seek it
to be realised. It is a vision of the players for the benefit of the
players and will only be achieved through the players.''
In addition to players, WRC also envisaged professional coaches,
medics, and referees and planned a March-October season, running
concurrently throughout the world.
Yesterday, in Australia, as a result of the threat of test players
defecting to WRC, the players aligned themselves to the ARFU but only
after it agreed to player representation in decision-making bodies.
The move was welcomed by Scotland lock Damian Cronin -- in Australia
for a Barbarians' game -- who said other rugby authorities should follow
the Australian lead.
In Johannesburg, Mr Turnbull denied the decision by the Australian
players to stick with the union meant that his organisation was
finished. The situation in South Africa is not as clear-cut as it is in
the Antipodes and a large number of South African provincial players
have formed a players' association and have indicated they are still
interested in the WRC proposals.
Mr Turnbull said: ''WRC has not fallen down. All that WRC has done is
merge its interests into the rugby unions and it will assist the players
in South Africa in achieving a satisfactory result with their unions.''

As the hot spell
continues, many
blame heat rage
for an upsurge
in violence,
Dr Geoff Lowe
looks at the facts
WHEN the weather turns hot, tempers start to flare, and violent crime
rates go up. This is a common-sense view, but one that contradicts
several laboratory studies that attempt to explain how temperature
affects aggression. Now, American researchers using data from city
streets have come down on the side of common sense.
Laboratory experiments have shown that hotter temperatures do indeed
provoke anger and aggression -- but only to a point. At around 85F
aggression becomes a less important motivator of behaviour than does
just getting out of the heat.
But outside the laboratory, things may happen differently, say the
researchers who monitored the number of criminal assaults reported to
the Chicago police department daily from June through August. They also
noted the average temperatures on those days.
Elsewhere, others were counting the number of ''aggression-anger''
crimes (rape and murder) and ''non-aggression-anger'' crimes (robbery
and arson) recorded in the Houston Chronicle newspaper and charting the
maximum daily temperature.
In both cities the number of aggressive, violent crimes increased as
the temperature rose -- well past the point at which laboratory studies
predicted that aggressive tendencies would decrease. Non-aggressive
crimes did not appear to be related to changes in temperature.
Why this contradiction between street life and the laboratory? The
researchers speculate that since high temperatures are more obvious in
the laboratory, people may attribute their aggressive feelings to the
heat and then overcompensate by trying to calm down.
This does not prove that more heat causes more violence, the
researchers caution. But their results show that temperature does not
always affect aggression the way psychologists thought it did.
In Britain, of course, we don't usually get too many hot days.
However, we do get warm spells now and again, and this summer they have
been remarkably prolonged. During such times, certain changes in
behaviour are noticeable. First, more people are out and about: and
secondly, there is more drinking going on. These could be significant
factors. But I haven't yet been able to find anyone who's been willing
to stay inside and analyse the daily aggressive crime rates.
However, the practical experience of police and ambulance crews
frequently confirms that heat plus drinking equals aggression. Many
officers agree that the warmth may be less responsible for trouble than
the drinking which the hot days (and nights) have encouraged.
''Heat does encourage people to drink,'' said one police inspector.
''They set out in good spirits, drink too much and get over-exuberant.
Then tempers fray and the police have more work to do. When I was on the
beat I disliked working on a warm night because I knew more people would
be staying out drinking, instead of going home.''

University of Hull.
BLAME IT ON THE WEATHER
* KEEP a weather eye open and you'll find it easier to get on with
people, say psychologists investigating the more general effects of
weather on human behaviour.
They found that the best time to make up after a quarrel is just after
a storm. People tend to be more friendly during this period, when the
temperature is going back to normal.
* THE ideal time for brainwork is when it is moderately cold and
windy. Psychologists at Baylor University College, Houston, Texas, also
suggest it's the best time to fill in your income tax forms.
* THE physical stresses put on the body by heat, cold, wind and rain
seem to hit both your humour and efficiency. One of the most trying
times for human relationships is said to be during the few hours before
a storm, when the reduced atmospheric pressure slows circulation of the
blood which is carrying oxygen to the brain. This makes people irritable
and depressed.
* DURING the lull before a storm, hospitals are often busier than
usual. Ill people get worse, unbalanced people are more likely to become
violent, and more women nearing childbirth go into labour.
* IT is also the worst time for practical jokes, but the psychologists
found that when a storm is over and conditions are cooler, people reach
a peak of good humour. That is also an ideal time for salesmen. People
are more receptive to sales talk, less critical and more likely to buy
things they cannot really afford.
* MODERATE cold is mentally stimulating. The researchers found that
there were nearly 20% more examination passes in April and November than
in June and July.

Jerusalem
AN ISRAELI military historian alleged today that Israeli troops, under
the command of the current housing minister, killed 300 Egyptian
prisoners-of-war in the 1967 Middle East war.
However, a spokesman for housing minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said
the minister denied all knowledge of the alleged killings. ''Ben-Eliezer
knows nothing about the killing of POWs by the Shaked commando unit,''
he said.
Mr Arieh Yitzhaki made the allegation days after Egypt asked Israel to
look into reports its troops killed dozens of POWs in the 1956 Sinai
Campaign.
''Things like this happened in every war,'' Mr Yitzhaki told Israel
Radio, which said he was with Israel's Bar Ilan University.
Mr Yitzhaki said the most famous case was in Egypt's Sinai desert
during the 1967 war. He said that in one battle in northern Sinai about
300 Egyptian soldiers had surrendered and were later killed by Israeli
troops.
''In effect, in a matter of hours the whole Eygptian force was
liquidated -- around 300 soldiers were shot and killed after a good
number of them surrendered,'' he said.
The historian said soldiers of the Shaked commando unit, under the
command of then Lieutenant-Colonel Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, now the housing
minister, killed the Egyptians. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was the
army chief of staff during the war.
An Israeli official who declined to be named said the Mr Yitzhaki's
story was wrong, and was aimed at slandering Mr Rabin's left-centre
government.
However, Mr Yitzhaki said he researched the killings for the army
after the war, but his superiors discarded the results in what he termed
''a conspiracy of silence''.
He said he had decided to disclose the information because of the
attention focused on the killing of 49 Egyptian POWs in the 1956 Sinai
campaign. A right-wing member of parliament was commander of the unit
implicated in the 1956 killings.
Earlier this month, former Israeli officer Arieh Biro told the
country's newspapers that he killed Egyptian POWs in 1956, captured
after Israel invaded the Sinai peninsula.
Mr Biro said he was company commander under Mr Rafael Eitan -- later
an army chief and now a member of parliament who wants to run for prime
minister in 1996.
An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said Israel, acting on a request
from Cairo two days ago, was looking into a report of the 1956 killings.
In response to a question about the Biro interview, put to him by
Education Minister Amnon Rubinstein, Mr Rabin, in a statement released
by his office today, condemned the 1956 incident.
Recalling the years just after Israel's founding in 1948, Mr Rabin
said: ''In the army's early years . . . it was characterised by birth
pains of an army that did not yet have battle norms, behaviour,
discipline.
''I condemn completely his (Biro's) hard words and, all the more, the
act itself,'' Mr Rabin added.-- Reuter

<HEADLINE>ScotRail's tender put on hold.   Privatisation timetable delayed.</HEADLINE>

SCOTRAIL has been dropped from the second tranche of train operators
formally to be invited next month to run services after privatisation.
It admitted yesterday that it was ''difficult to say'' if the
Government's aim to sell it off by next April would be achieved.
Its removal from the list is the latest alarm bell for the Government,
suggesting its railway plans are in confusion, especially north of the
border.
Tender invitations have gone out, as scheduled, to three English
operators to run the networks in their own areas: Great Western, South
West Trains, and LTS (London Tilbury and Southend).
However, that programme is now in danger after a railway protest group
yesterday launched a legal action which could seriously damage the
privatisation timetable in England. Save Our Railways went to the High
Court to challenge the way the frequency-of-service requirements were
set down for the trio by franchise director Roger Salmon.
The next in line to receive invitations to tender have always been
named as ScotRail, Midland Mainline, Network South East, and Gatwick
Express. ScotRail, widely regarded as a flagship privatisation, has now
been replaced in the September list by InterCity East Coast.
British Rail sources indicated they now had no idea when a formal
invitation to lodge a bid would be issued to ScotRail, a shadow
franchise.
Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish, increasingly confident that
privatisation can be stopped in its tracks, said: ''It is not only the
September date for a tender invitation that has been postponed. I
understand ScotRail has slipped way down the list, perhaps even into
next year.''
The final document setting out the minimum Passenger Service
Requirement (PSR) for a privatised ScotRail is still expected to be
issued next month, according to the Office of Passenger Rail
Franchising, which also stood by its long-standing declaration of April
to conclude ScotRail's sale.
Consultations on the PSR, a contractual obligation on a train operator
to deliver a specified level of service, were ''drawing to a close'',
said Opraf.
However, Councillor Charles Gordon, Strathclyde region's transport
committee convener, insisted yesterday that, since October 1994, there
had been no ''serious, detailed discussions'' between Strathclyde,
ScotRail, and Opraf on service levels within the region after
privatisation.
Councillor Gordon added that he was not even sure if Strathclyde --
the largest commuter network outside London -- would even be included in
the PSR which ScotRail requires to work out its operating costs.
Strathclyde -- ScotRail's biggest customer, buying about 40% of all
services -- is adamant it must have control of the local timetable and
be able to regulate all fares in its area. The Strathclyde Passenger
Transport Executive will continue to operate after the unitary
authorities come into being.
A ScotRail spokeswoman admitted it has ''dropped back'' in the
original schedule of train operators being invited to tender.
She blamed the slippage on ScotRail being unable to complete certain
works in time, including the validation and signing of legal agreements
in connection with the privatisation process.
ScotRail also said that it does not have a definite date for the
release of the PSR, which will be used to calculate its tender bid.
She stressed that ScotRail continues to work to the April sale date
but added: ''It is difficult to say if that date will be achieved.''
She added: ''We still expect to be franchised by early next year.
Whether or not it will be a couple of months after April, we do not
know. It is not up to us when invitations go out to tender.''
Mr McLeish said Opraf's timetable for ScotRail's sell-off was ''wholly
ridiculous'' given the problems it faces in trying to work out costs of
providing services.
He challenged all interested parties ''to come clean'' on the troubles
associated with privatising the railways.
Opraf's assurance that ScotRail's sale is proceeding as planned
coincided with growing rows over potentially dangerous shortfalls in
railway safety which the Labour Party believes could lead to a collapse
of privatisation plans.
It also coincided with Save Our Railway, which includes MPs, rail
unions, and passenger interests, claiming that Mr Salmon had not
complied fully with the 1993 Railways Act.
The campaign co-ordinator, Mr Jonathan Bray, said Mr Salmon should
have published the criteria by which he reached decisions about PSRs.
The group yesterday applied for leave to seek a judicial review of PSR
procedures over the first three lines to be privatised.
It hopes an initial hearing will be held by the end of September.
Similar legal challenges to various stages of privatisation have
failed so far.
A Scottish council did win a notable court victory in Edinburgh,
forcing British Rail to retain the axed Fort William-London sleeper
service.

Paris
CHINA expelled Greenpeace activists today after they staged a protest
against nuclear weapons testing -- while France was buoyed by a
scientific report that its own planned tests in the South Pacific posed
little risk to health.
The activists, who had unfurled a bright yellow banner in Tiananmen
Square in central Beijing on Tuesday, said their protest had been a
success and vowed to repeat it.
''We do what we have to do and we will do it again or we will do it
differently in the future as well,'' said Harald Zindler, the German who
planned the brief Beijing protest.
The banner demanded that China halt its testing programme.
Police quickly ripped down the banner and detained the activists,
charging them with conducting an illegal protest.
The Greenpeace activists had travelled to Beijing after France accused
the global environmental group of hypocrisy.
Greenpeace has waged a sustained campaign against French plans to
resume tests in the South Pacific next month but had said little about
China, the only other nuclear power now openly supporting weapons
testing.
France picked up rare support for its plans from an unusual source --
scientists from Australia and New Zealand, the two countries which are
leading protests against French President Jacques Chirac's decision to
break a 1992 moratorium and hold seven to eight tests between September
and next May.
A report by 20 scientists from those two nations, released at a
meeting of South Pacific environment ministers, said the tests posed
minimal health risks in the region despite radiation leakage expected
from the coral test sites.
''The impact on the health of the people in the Pacific is not likely
to be significant,'' said Sydney University geology professor Peter
Davies.
The report concluded the main testing site on the Mururoa atoll in
French Polynesia could leak radiation within 50 years.
However it said the leakage would be so small as to pose only a
minimal health risk to those on the atoll.
Perhaps buoyed by the report, Paris dismissed Australia's request for
a scientific inspection of Mururoa before the start of testing, rather
than afterwards as planned by Paris.
''We don't see any need for a mission beforehand,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Yves Doutriaux told reporters. ''There have already been
missions which have shown there are no consequences for the
environment.''
France said last week it had invited the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) to organise a scientific inspection of the atoll after its
tests were conducted.
Australian Environment Minister John Faulkner said, however, that
access to the site was required before the tests to guard against
environmental damage.
Chirac tackled the controversy over his testing plans by reassuring
several dozen world leaders of France's support for an eventual ban on
all nuclear blasts.
His office said Chirac wrote to the heads of state of nations
bordering the Pacific Ocean to assure them of France's intention to sign
a comprehensive test ban treaty in late 1996.
In the letters, Chirac reiterated that the tests planned from next
month would be France's very last and that it supported a ban on all
nuclear blasts, no matter how small, as part of the test ban treaty, the
Elysee said.
The European Union Commission said it hoped an upcoming meeting with
French officials would help it sort out how to police Paris's testing
plans.
An EU treaty on nuclear activities requires Commission assent for
''particularly dangerous'' activities liable to affect the territories
of other EU member states.
Commission officials have complained that they are unable to determine
if the French plans are ''particularly dangerous'' if they are only able
to inspect the Mururoa site after the tests have been completed --

Los Angeles
THE chief prosecutor in the O J Simpson murder case today withdrew her
request that the trial judge stand down and turn the proceedings over to
another jurist.
Deputy district attorney Marcia Clark on Tuesday had asked Judge Lance
Ito to disqualify himself from the case, saying he could not be
impartial about evidence and testimony involving the judge's wife, a
police captain.
However, today Clark said prosecutors had wrestled with the issue and
decided that Judge Ito's withdrawal ''would not be the appropriate
course in this case'', although there were still ''practical problems''
to be resolved.
At issue was whether Judge Ito could rule impartially on matters
related to Detective Mark Fuhrman, a controversial prosecution witness,
after learning he had made disparaging remarks about the judge's wife in
taped interviews with a screenwriter.
Judge Ito ruled on Tuesday that another judge would decide the
admissibility of the tapes in order to remove any appearance of conflict
of interest on his part.
Ms Clark said later that day that Judge Ito's complete withdrawal was
''the only road to take'' but defence attorneys accused prosecutors of
trying to force a mistrial and said they would fight to keep Judge Ito
on the case.
The judge had ordered both sides to submit written arguments, saying
he would make a decision today. His departure would have forced a long
delay, possibly even putting the case at risk of a mistrial.
Detective Fuhrman's comments also contradict a sworn statement Judge
Ito's wife filed last year, saying she had limited knowledge of the
detective and had no disagreements with him.
The defence wants to play the tapes to discredit Detective Fuhrman,
who found a bloody glove behind the Simpsons' mansion. The defence has
alleged a police conspiracy to fabricate evidence against Mr Simpson for
the June 12, 1994, murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her
friend Ronald Goldman.
Mr Simpson says he is innocent.
On Tuesday, Judge Ito removed himself from the narrow issue of whether
the tapes should be admitted. Superior court Judge John Reid was
immediately put to work on that task.
''I love my wife dearly,'' Judge Ito said from the bench, fighting for
composure, ''and I am wounded by criticism of her, as any spouse would
be''.
Judge Ito has presided for more than a year over the Los Angeles
trial, which has riveted audiences in the United States to live
television coverage.
At the centre of the controversy are taped conversations between
Detective Fuhrman and a North Carolina scriptwriter who interviewed him
from 1985 to 1994 as part of a screenwriting project about police.
The tapes have been kept secret and are under a strict protective
order limiting access to a handful of lawyers, but some details have
dribbled out.
Court transcripts of private meetings on Monday revealed that on the
tapes, Detective Fuhrman described alleged police brutality and made
derogatory remarks about one of Mr Simpson's lawyers, Robert Shapiro. --

Nairobi
FOSSILS of a new pre-human species discovered in Kenya show that our
ancestors were walking upright four million years ago -- much earlier
than previously thought -- anthropologist Meave Leakey said today.
''They show very clearly that four million years ago, our ancestors
did not swing around like apes,'' Leakey told a news conference in
Nairobi to announce the discovery.
''The discoveries add very important new insights into the very
earliest stages of human evolution and establish that upright posture
and bipedalism go back in time to beyond four million years.''
The fossils were found in north-western Kenya's Lake Turkana basin by
a National Museums of Kenya research team headed by Leakey and have been
named ''Australopithecus anamensis''.
The finds include jaws and teeth, dating between 3.9 and 4.1 million
years ago, a piece of skull including the ear region and a lower leg
bone.
Until Tim White. of the University of Berkeley in California. and his
colleagues last year announced the discovery of a new species of early
hominid from 4.4 million-year-old deposits in Ethiopia, the earliest
known human ancestor was Australopithecus afarensis -- a partial
skeleton nicknamed ''Lucy'' and discovered by Meave Leakey's husband
Richard in the 1970s.
Meave Leakey said the newly-found fossils had features consistent with
them being ancestors of ''Lucy''.
Previously, the earliest evidence of pre-humans walking were
footprints found in 3.75 million-year-old volcanic ash at Laetoli in
Tanzania.
Leakey said primitive features distinguishing the species from other
known early human ancestors were in the crania and dentition and
included almost parallel mandibular tooth rows set close together, large
canines with long strong roots, wide flaring molar teeth and a small
elliptical external opening of the ear.
''In contrast, the leg and arm bones have relatively modern morphology
and the shape of the former indicates that at this early date, human
ancestors were walking bipedally,'' Leakey said.
The most complete specimens of Australopithecus anamensis were
recovered from a site south-west of Lake Turkana. With the exception of
one specimen the fossils were recovered between 1988 and 1995.
Leakey said the national museum research work around Lake Turkana was
a long-term project in an area investigated for 27 years since her
husband led an initial expedition in 1968.
The fossils were found on the surface and Leakey said she planned to
start excavating in the next expedition period from May to August next
year for any possible additional evidence -- Reuter.

THE Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Sinn Fein
president Gerry Adams are set to hold further talks on the peace
process.
A meeting is expected to take place around the first anniversary of
the IRA ceasefire in a fortnight's time, according to republicans.
One Sinn Fein source said: ''We see this meeting as a critical one if
we are to move out of the current impasse caused by the lack of movement
towards all-party talks.''
Sir Patrick is not expected back in Belfast from his summer holidays
until the end of next week, and Mr Adams is due to start a series of
speaking engagements, mostly in the Republic.
However, it is expected Mr Adams and Mr Martin McGuinness, a key
member of Sinn Fein's ruling executive, will soon have talks with Sir
Patrick and Mr Michael Ancram, the Minister in charge of political
development at the Northern Ireland Office.
The ceasefire anniversary is on August 31.
The two sides have already met three times, once at an economic
conference in Washington, again privately in Londonderry, and then at
Stormont Castle at the end of last month.
It was at the latter that Mr Adams put forward a set of proposals for
the Government to consider. No details have been released, but Sinn Fein
are pressing for involvement in all-party talks as soon as possible.
Downing Street is resisting the pressure because no agreement has been
reached on possible arrangements for IRA disarmament.
It is now clear that Mr Adams will be looking for Ministerial movement
towards inclusive negotiations at the next meeting.
A Sinn Fein source said: ''The issue of decommissioning and prisoners
are important, but they are being used by the British to cause divisions
and distractions. The key issue is all-party talks and that is what we
will be focusing our effort on to try and break the impasse.''
A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said no date had been fixed for
another meeting but confirmed: ''Contacts with Sinn Fein continue.''

ANN SHAW talks to Sheila McNamara the author of a book about the
fruits of the new medical detente with Chinese traditional medicine
IF WESTERN medicine fails to cure you, try Chinese -- that's what
Sheila McNamara, author of Traditional Chinese Medicine advocates. Her
book, written in conjunction with Dr Song Xuan Ke, of the Chinese
Medical Centre in Bath, strikes a balance between East and West,
successfully explaining the basic philosophy that lies at the heart of
the Chinese approach to illness.
Restore the natural harmony in the body, say Chinese doctors, and you
are on the way to helping the body cure itself. (Think back to the last
time you suffered stress.)
Yes, this may be a simplistic explanation of traditional Chinese
medicine (TCM) but at least it's a starting point for those approaching
Eastern medicine for the first time.
Certainly during the past few years there has been a growing
acceptance in the West that TCM -- both its herbs and acupuncture
techniques -- clearly works even though the mechanisms remain unknown.
But how much truth is there in it? Sheila McNamara, a journalist who
became interested in the subject while writing a series of articles for
the Observer in the early 90s, has taken a cool, detached, look at the
East-West medical debate.
The result is a useful guide written in layman's terms, offering an
introduction to the complex Oriental system of treating illness. It also
contains a comprehensive A-Z of common ailments and the Chinese method
of treatment.
''I was amazed at the response to the Observer articles,'' says
Sheila, now working for the Eastern Express in Hong Kong. ''Clearly
there is a lot of interest in the subject and a demand for more
information.''
So she visited China. She found Western and Eastern medicine being
practised side by side. Not surprisingly she came in for some shocks.
''We were touring an intensive care unit in a Beijing hospital and I
asked what was in the intravenous drip. Cow gallstones was the answer.''
The patient had suffered a heart attack and cow gallstones are known
to speed up the recovery rate.
The Chinese believe food is medicine, and medicine food. In one
hospital McNamara visited in Chegdu, Sichuan Province, the dining hall
had dozens of medicated diet recipes for patients suffering from
conditions such as diabetes, obesity and heart problems.
''The Chinese think the Western diet with its emphasis on long,
slow-cooked rich food simply invites diseases like 'flu,'' says
McNamara.
Attitudes are changing in the West: since 1979 the World Health
Organisation has endorsed acupuncture for pain relief. But its uses are
far wider -- ranging from high blood pressure to insomnia, skin
disorders to arthritis.
The problem is that both West and East approach illness from a
completely different perspective: Western medicine bases itself on drugs
and surgery, while the Eastern approach, derived from 4000 years of
civilisation is more complex. It takes a holistic approach to the body,
treating not just the symptom but the source: why treat the branch when
the problem is at the root, say the Chinese.
Today in China, leading hospitals use both systems with doctors
qualified in Western and Eastern medicine, and they use whatever has
proved to be the most effective. For example, cancer patients may be
treated with chemotherapy and Eastern medicine to help rebuild the
body's immune system. It is this combination of systems that McNamara
found most fascinating during her researches.
''It depends on what is wrong with you which method they use,'' says
McNamara.''If you are suffering from a bacterial infection then
antibiotics are best. If it's a viral complaint then you are more likely
to have success with Chinese medicine.''
Some herbs used in Chinese medicine are known to be able to break down
the structure of viruses, and these are currently undergoing Western
scientific trials in America.
But why is Chinese medicine still regarded as outlandish in the West,
smacking almost of witchcraft? Well, the blinkered approach of many
Western doctors coupled with the built-in bias of the pharmaceutical
industry which has a vested interest in developing synthetic drugs may
be one of the stumbling blocks.
Despite this an increasing number of Chinese scientists are
collaborating with Western colleagues to narrow the gap between the
ancient and modern wisdom and modern technical expertise.
One of the difficulties is the lack of medical papers written in
English and the absence of scientific evidence in the form of
double-blind trials. ''Chinese doctors consider it their moral duty to
treat a patient. To give one tablets which are known to be a placebo is
totally against everything they have been taught,'' explains McNamara.
Nevertheless Chinese doctors -- aware of the West's demand for
scientifically controlled experiments -- are persevering with such
trials, despite occasional hitches. One trial was invalidated in Beijing
when it was discovered that some patients had been attending their local
shaman as well as the hospital.
Sometimes the subtlety of Chinese medicine challenges reason: two
people sitting in a clinic with the same complaint, say eczema, walk out
with different herbal remedies. ''Yes, that's true,'' says McNamara,
''It depends what part of the body is affected.''
It gets even more complicated. Not only are there different herbs to
treat the same complaint, but the effect of these herbs vary depending
on the time of the year they are harvested and the region of China in
which they are grown.
Many Western doctors do not accept that ME, or post-viral syndrome,
exists. In China there is no name for this condition as such, but
traditional Chinese medicine certainly know how to treat it.
''If I had ME and had an unsympathetic doctor I would have no
hesitation in going to a Chinese one,'' added McNamara.
This brings me to my next question: has she ever used TCM herself?
''No, but then I'm never ill.''
She realls an incident in one London newspaper office during a flu
epidemic. ''Staff were going down like proverbial flies. Then someone
brought in a proprietory brand of Chinese herbs. Next day she was cured.
All those who used it as soon as they got flu symptoms found it helped
them too.'' What about the bad publicity over herbal poisoning? Well
yes, McNamara replied, there might have been a handful of cases in
recent years but they can be explained by people using left-over
prescriptions which were months out of date or buying contaminated herbs
from an unreliable source. ''The number of these cases is very small
compared to the number damaged by Western drugs.''
It is as well to remember that there's no such thing as a harmless
medicine, whether Western or Eastern; if it's effective then it will
have some side-effects, unless of course it's merely a placebo.
McNamara sums it up: ''Linking the two medical systems together may be
the best hope for the future.''
Her book Traditional Chinese Medicine (Hamish Hamilton, #17.99) marks
one step along this difficult route.

TWO British tourists taken hostage by Kashmiri separatists have been
given a stay of execution, Indian officials believe, following fresh
talks with their kidnappers.
The Al-Faran militants, who beheaded a Norwegian hostage on Sunday,
contacted Indian negotiators yesterday, indicating there was still hope
of a deal to secure freedom for the four westerners they are holding.
In a note found on the body of Hans Ostroe, the kidnappers threatened
to kill the remaining hostages -- Britons Keith Mangan, 34, and Paul
Wells, 23, an American and a German on Tuesday unless India released 15
jailed militants.
Kulbushan Jandial, director of information in Kashmir, said: ''In the
absence of any adverse report, we presume the four hostages are still
safe.
''We are hopeful of progress.''
Mr Mangan's mother Mavis, who was braced to hear the worst, said: ''It
sounds a little bit more promising. I just hope it's true.''
She added from her home in Middlesbrough: ''We just don't know what to
believe. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.''
Mr Jandial said it was not clear what Al-Faran was now demanding.
''They're being very vague. It's not very firm.''
He refused to comment on reports that India was offering to trade some
militants for the hostages.
A post-mortem examination on Mr Ostroe appeared to contradict Indian
government claims that he was malnourished or tortured.
Andrew Reekea, a British doctor who witnessed the autopsy in New
Delhi, said it showed he had been in good health and there were no signs
of a struggle, suggesting he may have been killed in his sleep.
''Death came very rapidly. He had a loss of consciousness almost
immediately,'' he said.
Meanwhile, it emerged that Scotland Yard sent hostage negotiators to
advise on the crisis.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: ''Metropolitan police negotiators are
in New Delhi advising the High Commissioner, who is working in close
co-operation with the Indian authorities.''
Scotland Yard refused to comment.
Earlier, Mr Wells' father Bob called on the Indian authorities to
consider mounting a military rescue.
They would ''have to weigh up the dangers of leaving the hostages
where they are against the dangers of them being shot during a rescue
attempt'', he told the Lancashire Evening Telegraph from his home in
Blackburn.
''We want them out as soon as possible and it looks like sending in
the military may be the only alternative.''
He called his son's captors ''evil, murdering thugs'' who should be
shot if they were caught.
For the first time in their five-year struggle for independence from
India, Kashmiris yesterday held a general strike against a militant
group.
They called on Al-Faran, relatively unknown before the kidnappings, to
free its captives.
''Our hearts are bleeding for the hostages,'' said one businessman.
''We don't know who Al-Faran is, but we hope its barbarity hasn't hurt
our cause.''
Al-Faran released a statement rejecting widespread criticism, within
Kashmir and by foreign countries, of its tactics and claiming its
members were Kashmiri Muslims.
THE Scots minister whose daughter disappeared in Kashmir 14 years ago,
yesterday expressed his concerns -- and his hopes -- over the remaining
hostages (writes Alan Hunter).
The Rev Kenneth MacDonald of Rosskeen, near Invergordon, said that the
execution of the Norwegian hostage added a new dimension to the civil
war.
Having visited the area several times in the search for his daughter,
Alison, then 19 years-old, Mr MacDonald, 60, a retired Free Kirk
minister, said: ''The execution, I feel, has raised a completely new
picture. I think this was done by a rogue group, not subject to any
particular command. As a result they have lost all credibility.''
Mr MacDonald, who last visited Kashmir in May, retired in June, having
contracted multiple sclerosis.
He believes his daughter is still alive, abducted by a Muslim
community, and possibly living in mountainous territory in a closed
environment.
Giving up the search for his daughter is something he can never
contemplate, he said.

From PATRICK BROGAN Washington, Wednesday
THERE was another blow to the Democrats today. One of their most
popular Senators, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, announced that he will not
run for re-election next year.
That brings to six the number of Democratic Senators who will retire
then, with at least one more retirement expected -- and further reduces
their already slim hopes of winning the election.
The Democrats lost eight Senate seats and control of both House and
Senate in last year's election, and since then two others have defected
to the Republicans.
There are now 54 Republicans and 46 Democrats in the Senate, and if
things go really badly next year, the Republicans might have a total of
60, which would enable them to end every Democratic threat of
filibuster, and thus to ram through their agenda -- a task that is now
beyond them.
Senator Bradley often was mentioned as a possible candidate for
President, but he never took the plunge. He was nearly upset by an
unknown Republican in his last election, in 1990, which he had assumed
he would win easily.
The unknown, Christine Todd Whitman, ran for governor in 1994.
She would make a formidable candidate for the Senate next year if she
decided to run.

FEARS that Britain's economic recovery is faltering emerged yesterday
when the latest unemployment figures showed an increase for the first
time in almost two years.
The 1700 jump in the jobless in July to 2,315,300 brought to an end a
run of 22 monthly falls and was immediately seized on by opposition
politicians as an indictment of Government economic policies.
Figures in Scotland revealed a rise of 400. The rise, to 198,400 last
month, provoked an outcry from opposition parties.
Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Jim Wallace said it was a huge blow
for thousands of Scots and for business confidence. The SNP said that,
with the UK economy in the doldrums, rising unemployment was further
evidence of the stagnation of Scotland's economy within the Union.
However, Scottish Office Junior Minister Lord Lindsay said the figures
showed a significant reduction in long-term unemployment since last
July.
The Government blamed the rise on technical factors and took comfort
from subdued average earnings growth, up by 3.5% in the year to June,
unchanged from May.
Analysts said the earnings data suggested little danger of wage
inflation taking off, thereby reducing pressure for a interest rate
hike.
The Government was also cheered by a slightly biggerthan expected rise
in retail sales, up by 0.4% in July compared with June, and 0.7% over
the latest three months compared with the previous three.
Shadow environment spokesman Frank Dobson said the rise in the jobless
total gave ''the lie to the Government's claims to have turned around
the economy''.
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce said: ''This is the
greatest conceivable indictment of Conservative economic policies.
However, Education and Employment Minister Eric Forth said:
''Unemployment figures are often erratic in the summer months as large
numbers of students flow in and out of education and the labour market.
''Unemployment has fallen in the last quarter amongst every age group
except 20 to 24-year-olds.''
Concern that interest rates might have to rise again soon from their
current level of 6.75% was stirred by figures on Monday showing a sharp
increase in the price of goods leaving factory gates in July.
The next base rate review by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of
England Governor Eddie George, who has been pressing for an increase in
the cost of borrowing since May, takes place on September 7.
''Underlying inflation probably will still rise further as the recent
input price surge feeds through,'' said Mr Michael Saunders, UK
economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank.
The public finances were in better shape last month, with the public
sector borrowing requirement shinking to #700m from #3.5bn in June and
#1.3bn in July 1994.

HOURS after Hurricane Felix lashed Bermuda, residents of Britain's
oldest remaining colony voted on whether to seek independence.
Power was restored to most homes and roads were cleared as voters
headed to the 20 polling stations for the first referendum since the
British claimed the chain of Atlantic ocean islands in 1684.
''The weather is fine,'' government spokesman Gavin Shorto said as the
storm abated and the 38,000 eligible voters began to cast ballots on the
future of the islands known as an international tax haven and holiday
attraction. The referendum was cancelled yesterday because of the
hurricane.
Bermudians, who enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the
world and run their own Government, were expected to reject
independence.
Hurricane Felix's gale force winds and heavy rains yesterday lashed
the islands. A few small hotels were damaged by 40ft waves, but the
colony escaped relatively unscathed and there were no deaths or serious
injuries.
An opinion poll published last month by The Royal Gazette, Bermuda's
only daily newspaper, showed 63% opposed to oppose independence with
only 17% in favour. The remainder was undecided.
Blacks, who make up about 60% of the population, were expected to vote
in higher numbers than white Bermudians for independence but the measure
still had virtually no chance of passing, political analysts said.
Results are expected tomorrow.
Meanwhile, more than 75,000 people took cover as Hurricane Felix
whipped up high surf, flooding, and dangerous riptides from Florida to
New England.
Although the storm's centre was 150 miles offshore, near
tropical-storm strength winds were tearing through Nags Head, a small
town 60 miles north of Cape Hatteras, where Felix is expected to hit
land tomorrow.
Tides up to 8ft above normal and 10ins of rain are expected.

Baghdad
IRAQ said today that it was not intimidated by US warnings of military
force over Iraqi defectors in Jordan and its anti-air defences carried
out an exercise to confront possible threats.
US defence officials said on Tuesday they were keeping one aircraft
carrier longer than planned in the Gulf and sending another to the
eastern Mediterranean to deal with possible Iraqi threats to Jordan
following the Iraqi defections last week.
Iraq dismissed the reinforcements as ''cowboy policies'' and the
ruling Baath Party newspaper said Iraq's military command of anti-air
defences completed a successful ''tactical exercise to face possible
threats on 14-15 of August.''
''Air bases and sectors of air defence took part,'' the paper said,
quoting a telegram from Defence Minister General Sultan Hashim Ahmed to
President Saddam Hussein.
Hashim, who took over the defence ministry from Saddam's cousin,
General Ali Hassan al-Majeed last month, said the exercise was ordered
by the president.
Another official, Nouri al-Marsoumi, senior undersecretary at Iraq's
culture and information ministry, delivered a scathing attack on the US
military build-up in the region.
''America should distance itself from the morals and policy of cowboys
as evident in Western films . . . the use of the whip may be useful with
individuals but not with nations and countries which possess means to
respond,'' he said in a front-page article in the official al-Iraq
newspaper.
''The time has come for the American administration to learn from its
desperate lessons of the past that the revolution led by Saddam
Hussein... was born to stay,'' Marsoumi added.
Marsoumi said the fleeing of Lieutenant General Hussein Kamel Hassan,
who ran Iraq's military and civil industries, was ''an ordinary and
individual incident the like of which occurred several times in history
of nations and countries.''
Hussein Kamel and his brother Saddam Kamel, escaped to Jordan last
week with their wives, both daughters of Saddam, accompanied by a group
of aides.
Jordanian officials have said Iraq might send hit squads or use
radical Palestinians in Jordan to retaliate over the defections.
However, Iraqi officials have played down the affair, saying Baghdad's
ties with Amman would not change.
Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein's wife is in Jordan hoping to see her two
daughters, senior Jordanian officials said today.
''She (Sajida) arrived late yesterday (Tuesday) but we are not aware
if she has already met her daughters,'' one official said. The Iraqi
embassy denied that Sajida was in Jordan.
The defectors have been staying at one of King Hussein's guest palaces
near Amman under heavy army protection. -- Reuter.

ACTRESS Pauline Collins, on her first visit to the Edinburgh Festival,
said yesterday she would like to return.
Collins, who was leading a one-day workshop aimed at audition
presentation for actors and actresses, said work commitments had
prevented her from taking part before.
''I've never been before. I have always been working. I'd love to come
back and return for a week.''
After taking in an exhibition last night, the star of the film Shirley
Valentine said she would be unable to sample further festival delights.
She is going home to prepare with her husband, actor John Alderton,
for a potentially dangerous visit to Cambodia.
''We are going with Oxfam to raise the profile of landmines left
behind after the war.''The couple will be accompanied by a TV crew
making a documentary.

Bogota
PRESIDENT Ernesto Samper, whose government is reeling from Colombia's
worst political crisis in 10 years, declared a nationwide state of
emergency today to curb a wave of violence and kidnappings linked to the
country's drug lords and leftist guerrillas.
Samper said the measure would allow the government to combat ''a
situation of generalized violence'' in which 19,450 people have been
killed in the past six months and more than 700 kidnapped since January
1.
The measure will allow the embattled government to fight rebels and
right-wing paramilitary groups with equal force, he said.
He said the military would increase its presence in areas suffering
from ''conditions of political destabilisation'' across the country.
In his speech, Samper denied that his government was ''putting up a
smokescreen'' to draw attention away from the political crisis stemming
from charges that his political campaign last year was partly financed
by drug lords.
The crisis deepened yesterday with the arrest of Samper's campaign
manager and former defence minister on charges that he knew about the
alleged financing with drug dollars -- Reuter.
