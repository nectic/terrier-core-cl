GLASGOW'S own Cafe Royal at the Theatre Royal at the top of Hope
Street is a changed place after its September refurbishment. With autumn
in the air and a new season on stage next door, proprietor Billy
McAneney of Baby Grand, Cottiers and Cathedral House fame, is thinking
of changing the restaurant's name as well.
He said: ''Many members of the eating-out public have the impression
that the Cafe Royal is for the exclusive use of theatre patrons only.
That's not the case. We are open from 10am until midnight from Monday to
Saturday and the tables are there for anyone to use, whether they want a
cappuccino, a pint of Guinness or a plateful of grilled prawns.
''I'm offering a slap-up meal for two with wine as the prize for
finding an appropriate alternative title for the place, artistic
heritage and all. I can be contacted at 0141-332 1370 or the Cafe Royal,
282 Hope Street, Glasgow G2. Get those thinking caps on!''
A stylish, split-level restaurant/bar has been skilfully created by
Maria Charlesworth in an eclectic melange of the Bloomsbury Group,
Cocteau and Matisse. The wrought iron chairs are covered in fabrics from
the Designers Guild in London, the tables are topped with artistic
posters treated with varnish and crumpled to age, and the walls are hung
with original prints from the Glasgow Print Studio. The main floor is
stone slabbed and the raised area features Indonesian hardwood.
In keeping with its Top Spot past, a dark wood gantry has been
constructed from the designs of Glasgow architectural partnership
Maclachlan, Monaghan to complement the black marble-topped bar. Art
Nouveau cut-outs, a flowing pediment and a central pub clock impart a
fin de siecle feel.
It is Bin End time between the hours of 5pm and 7pm when October's
wine of the month, Trebbanio d'Abruzzo, a dry Italian white, is #1.30 a
glass and the beer of the month, Miller Lite, is #1.40 a bottle.
The lunchtime and dinner menus offer Mexican inspired and European
dishes. Ciabatta sandwiches at #2.95 are available all day. This week's
evening specials include lambs liver with paprika, garlic and red wine
vinegar, and monkfish with black olive paste served on grilled
radicchio. The desserts are scrumptious.

Would the executive on #100,000 be better off in real terms in another
European country?
Francis Shennan finds out
EUROPE'S WAY WITH TAX
SCOTTISH executives who want to improve their lot may be better moving
into Europe, at least as far as tax and social security deductions are
concerned. But the countries to choose are not the ones you would
expect.
To conclude the week of special tax features in The Herald, we look at
how different countries treat what is becoming known as the ''Europat''
-- the expatriate based in Europe.
Britain falls in the middle ranks of European countries when it comes
to the combined amount the Government grabs from executive pay in the
form of tax and social security contributions, according to a survey in
this month's issue of CA magazine prepared by accountants Price
Waterhouse.
An executive earning #100,000 in Britain, who is married with two
children, would take home #63,426, after paying #34,527 in tax and #2047
in National Insurance.
If he moved to Germany, he would walk away with only #61,656 in spite
of a smaller tax payment of #30,756. The reason is a social security
deduction more than 3.5 times the amount in Britain at #7588.
In France the social security deduction is more than seven times the
British amount at #15,003 but the direct tax levied is only #19,231,
leaving our Europat with #65,766 to put in the bank.
He would, in fact, be even better off because -- with a little asking
around -- he would learn that his #15,003 social security deduction can
be allowed against tax, so he will pay tax on only #84,997.
If our man wanted guaranteed good weather, he might be tempted to take
a post in Spain. There is a price tag attached, though. Income tax can
be high. His #100,000 there would be worth only #54,140 to him in
take-home pay.
Nor would a Swedish winter cool his anger. His net pay would drop to
#49,206. And the widespread image of Brussels as a feeding trough is
shattered if you do not have a tax-free salary. For in Belgium he would
walk home with even less: #45,678.
''The UK is no longer a high-tax country,'' says Colin Begg, senior
manager for International Assignment Services at Price Waterhouse in
Edinburgh. ''Although in the UK the top rate kicks in at a lower rate
than some countries.
''Another difference is that in a lot of European countries there are
more things which are deductible. In this country we have a personal
allowance and little else. In other countries you have any number of
tax-deductible items.
''If you are married with children in France, you have quite an
advantage. The more children you have, the less tax you pay.''
Some European countries have a habit of slapping on supplementary
taxes. Germany had a unification tax. Italy had an extra tax in 1994-95
to pay for the cost of flooding. Belgium has had such a supplementary
tax for the last 20 years.
There is a wide discrepancy too in the amount of social security
contributions an employer would have to pay for our fictional executive.
These range from #173 in Denmark to #32,000 in Belgium, #32,860 in
Sweden and a massive #35,945 in France.
Alongside those higher figures, Britain's #10,200 cost to employers
looks modest, although in a major competitor country like Germany the
cost is only #7588, and in a major rival for inward investment such as
Ireland it is less than a third of Britain's at #3198.
''The Europat business has been a growing one for people dealing with
expatriate tax,'' says Begg.
''Some people will go on foreign assignments for a particular project,
others as a career move. You get people employed in two or three
different countries and some are permanent expats.
''There certainly are European executives now who move around. I think
it depends what company you are with.
''You have two different categories: the person who moves from company
to company, or the one who spends a lifetime with one company and whose
moves depend on where the company does business.''
Net earnings for highly-paid executives has been growing as a result
of falling tax bills. Britain and France have had slight increases
between 1993 and 1995, but Germany, Spain and especially Sweden have
seen substantial rises, though all three are still among the countries
taking the biggest bite out of pay.
So where should our ambitious Europat turn his attention for a better
take-home cheque? Holland will allow him to keep #66,276 a year but only
because he is an expatriate. A registered expat worker can have 35% of
his employment income tax-exempted.
And it is because of tax concessions to expats that the usually
high-taxing Denmark will allow him to keep #70,444.
In some countries, of course, tax collection is not as efficient as in
Britain. In Italy, income tax does not become due until the following
year and, depending on the date our executive starts work there, the tax
bill might not become payable for 16 months.

A DEGREE of truth
More than one in 20 middle-managers falsify qualifications when they
apply for jobs, according to a nationwide survey by management
recruiters NB Selection.
The lies include invented degrees or enhancing the true grades,
passing off diplomas as degrees or hiding failed or unfinished degrees
under the heading Education instead of Qualifications on the CV.
In-house management courses are sometimes passed off as full MBAs.
Only three cases were discovered in Scotland, though, and when it came
to verifying claims of having degrees Strathclyde and Glasgow were among
the best in Britain for doing the checks quickly and accurately.
MANAGERS get the vote
* Businessmen and women are to be asked to give their views on the
Labour Party's plans for devolution in one of the largest such surveys
yet undertaken. The Fraser of Allander Institute has been asked to
undertake the research by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, which
represent 8000 businesses throughout Scotland.
Owners and managers will be asked how much of their business is with
the rest of the United Kingdom and will be presented with a range of
political options, from local government reform to full independence.
EXECUTIVES on the move
* More executives could soon be working outside the city centre if
planning permission is granted for a large number of edge-of-town office
developments which is currently being sought. According to Lambert Smith
Hampton, a shortage of good-quality office space will force rents to
rise sharply over the next two years.
And executives who have relocated to Glasgow are tending to put off
the buying of a property. They now prefer to rent rather than buy during
their first six months, according to Slater Hogg and Howison.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland receives its open learning programmes from
Telford Training and Consultancy (TTC). When the bank needed someone to
train staff in writing skills Telford produced a custom-built course.
TTC was launched three years ago to provide a flexible service for
companies looking for a more professional approach to training.
''We offer a flexible and tailored approach which meets clients' needs
-- there is no prescribed formula but there is a range of options,''
says Cathy McCallum, manager of Open Learning Consultancy Services
(OLCS) at Telford.
''Employers have recently become far more concerned with accreditation
and we can offer VQs up to level 5 -- which is as high as they go.
''The process of assessment is client-led. Some clients will already
have conducted a Training Needs Analysis (TNA), others will ask us to
lead them through it. Sometimes it reaches the level of sitting
one-to-one with the employee and figuring out their needs.''
OLCS adopts the open learning approach. Students start when they want
to start and work at their own pace. Studies can be done at home, at
work -- wherever the student wants.
McCallum believes this makes for better results. ''Distance learning
isn't as effective as this more flexible approach. We try to achieve at
least one face-to-face session per course,'' she says.
Even face-to-face tutorials need not call employees away from work.
OLCS can now use video-conferencing techniques to bring students
together via their PC screens.
''We are providing what businesses want,'' says Susan Gearing, company
administrator of Open Learning Consultancy Services (OLCS) at Telford
Training and Consultancy. ''We have 16 departments which can between
them form any combination of training services you can imagine.''

Joan Grady on training to fit the student
THE Nineties have seen a shift towards on-the-job training, with the
rise of vocational qualifications and programmes like Skillseekers. The
immediate advantages are plain -- the employee does not need time off
work to attend courses and the expense of training is reduced.
But the disadvantages of these methods are that trainees are often not
getting the opportunity to train at management level, and more advanced
training normally involves the employee spending time out of the office,
costing company time and money.
Many companies have now adopted the ''distance'' or ''open'' learning
approach which allows employees to fit in training around other
commitments.
''Open learning is attractive to staff as it gives them more control
over their own learning and development,'' says Lesley Thomson of the
Royal Bank of Scotland's open learning unit.
''The biggest advantage is that there is a wide range of management
subjects available when they are needed and students work at the pace,
time and place which suits them.''
The Royal Bank is now approaching its fourth year of supplying open
learning to its staff in the form of self-study courses. ''The student
has to be self-motivated so it is important that the materials are
relevant to the individual's training needs to ensure success,'' says
Thomson.
Prescribed activities and exercises allow the student to put new
techniques into practice in the workplace with support from their
managers.
Distance learning offers the employer and employee a chance to assess
more than basic management abilities. It shows the employee how to be
self-motivated and committed.
''Gaining knowledge and skills to do the job better will obviously
make the students feel more comfortable and will allow them to expand
their job to the full,'' says Thomson.
Nearly 3000 people took part in the bank's open learning courses last
year, and the figure is expected to keep rising.
One of the major advantages of distance learning is that courses can
be tailored to suit employers' and employees' needs. Some training
companies, such as Telford Training and Consultancy, the commercial arm
of Telford College, were set up to provide a more flexible service (see
side story).
''We are increasingly finding companies using a mixed approach to
training,'' says Cathy McCallum, manager of Open Learning Consultancy
Services (OLCS) at Telford. ''It's a combination of face-to-face
tuition, open learning and computerised systems.''
Distance learning is, by its nature, flexible. Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt
University runs an international distance learning MBA course which has
had more than 11,000 people buying courses over four years.
They are not cheap. The full MBA will cost #375 per compulsory course
manual (and there is a minimum of nine courses to pass) and #45 for each
examination. The grand total is #3375 for course materials only.
The advantage of this course is that it is not essential for a student
to pursue the entire MBA to benefit. The employer can choose courses
from the prospectus which he or she thinks would most benefit staff
sections or individuals.
''Our research tells us that the main reason for choosing this
university's degree is because it is totally flexible,'' says director
of studies Professor Keith Lumsden.
Being responsible for one's own success or failure seems to be a
powerful motivator. At Heriot-Watt the average pass rate is 74% for all
students, and for matriculated students the rate is 91%.
Most colleges and universities offering distance learning courses have
some sort of student support network. In others software is included
which gives students access to an ''electronic classroom''. Using a PC
and a modem link, students can ''meet'' to exchange ideas and
information and discuss coursework.
Telephone links are not quite so successful because the number of
students and their remote locations make finding the right person in the
right place at the right time very difficult.
At Heriot-Watt students can write in if they are having difficulties
with any aspect of the course. This makes it difficult to receive
on-the-spot help or advice, but as students have up to seven years to
complete the course, this is rarely a problem.
''Study of the academic query service reveals that less than three per
cent of students use it,'' says Professor Lumsden. ''Presumably the
texts themselves are effective.''
There is a student link network, but this is not often used.
''Students decide whether they want to be put in touch with others in
the same locality,'' says Lumsden. ''But the usual reason given for not
taking part is that, because students can begin the programme at any
time of the year, they are seldom at the same part at the same time and
the usefulness of getting together is lessened.''
Other courses or programmes might choose to run a mentoring system,
whereby each individual will be assigned a mentor or guide, to help with
any problems.
''Some organisations take mentoring on board themselves,'' says Cathy
McCallum, manager of OLCS. ''We can then offer to train these mentors
or, if the client prefers, we can set up external support, providing a
'listening ear' or putting students in touch with one another.''
At the Royal Bank of Scotland students are encouraged to seek support
from their line manager, particularly when it comes to putting their
newly-acquired skills into practice.
The bank's open learning training is supplementary to other forms of
training. ''Open learning gives staff another training option and
complements our in-house training provision,'' says Thomson. ''It fills
in any gaps and allows students to concentrate more on particular
subject areas essential to their personal development.''

BLACKBURN yesterday saved almost #2m when they completed the transfer
of Norwegian international Lars Bohinen from Nottingham Forest. The
Premiership champions capitalised on a clause in the midfielder's
contract which allowed him to leave Forest for just #200,000 more than
manager Frank Clark paid when he lured Bohinen to the City Ground from
Swiss side Young Boys Berne.
In today's inflated transfer market, Forest would have expected a fee
of around #2.5m for 29-year-old Bohinen, who immediately flew back to
his native Norway after concluding the deal at Ewood Park yesterday
afternoon.
The deal represents Rovers manager Ray Harford's biggest outlay on a
player, beating the #600,000 spent on recruiting Matty Holmes from West
Ham in August. But Harford has promised that the spending will not stop
there.
and he is keen to pacify the Ewood Park fans who have been
disappointed by the start the champions have made to the new season.
''We will have at least two new faces by the time we play Southampton
on Saturday week,'' said Harford, who is set to recoup a large slice of
the Bohinen cash by selling unsettled midfielder Lee Makel to Crystal
Palace.
Makel, signed from Newcastle, has been unable to command a regular
place at Blackburn and has been on a week-to-week contract since the
summer.
Forest manager Clark is angry over Bohinen's depature. -- even though
he admitted he was personally responsible for allowing the escape clause
to be included in the player's contract.
Asked Quizzed over why Bohinen had opted to go, Clark put his hand
into his pocket and threw a handful of coins on to the table, in front
of him, adding: ''I'm sure that's why. I don't know of any other
reason.''
''They must have offered him more money than we did in our new
contract. I'd be interested to know whether they've included the 47
clauses -- and I'm only slightly exaggerating -- he and I have
negotiated in the last seven months.
''I have to say I'm disappointed in Lars, very disappointed. I feel
let down. Betrayed might be a bit strong but I feel let down. I think
our supporters will be as well because they loved him.''
Clark refused to confirm or deny reports that Bohinen had demanded
#500,000 to have the clause removed and was clearly upset that its
existence had been widely circulated.
''Somebody has been putting it around for six months,'' he said. ''Two
managers told me in the summer that the situation had been brought to
their notice. I honestly don't know who it was. I tried to keep them
quiet but it got out.
''Don't get me wrong. I'm totally responsible. When he first joined us
we were in the first division and not doing that well and he was a
relatively unknown Norwegian with no experience of England.
''He asked for the clause as a bit of comfort in case the move didn't
work out. If he moved we'd still make a profit but since then it's been
a millstone round my neck because of how successful we've been and he's
been.
''We've been trying to negotiate a new contract with him for a long
time -- to get rid of the clause -- but his demands were just totally
over the top. The money he wanted to buy it out was totally
unacceptable.
''And they also wanted another clause that meant we'd have no right of
appeal if there was a dispute. I couldn't commit the club to that.''
The deal has been shrouded in controversy, with rumours circulating
that it has involved Rune Hauge, the Norwegian agent banned by FIFA in
the wake of the George Graham ''bung'' case.
Blackburn, however, insist negotiations have only involved Bohinen and
his official representative Frank Mathieson, a licensed agent registered
in Denmark.
Clark added that Swiss-based agent Andy Gross, who had been involved
in the detailed negotiations originally, had been dumped by Bohinen on
Tuesday, although the Forest boss said he did not know whether the Hauge
rumours were true.
''I don't know if he's involved,'' said Clark. ''He tried to get
involved when we signed Lars here but I would be amazed if any club had
dealings with Rune because he's suspended.''
However, FA official Clare Tomlinson revealed today that Blackburn
have been asked for their observations about Hauge's alleged role in the
transfer.

Levein yesterday spoke out about the darkest episode in his
footballing career as he looked forward to his testimonial match against
Coventry City at Tynecastle on Sunday -- a match which, given his bad
luck in his spell at the club, he is not surprised to be missing because
of injury.
His infamous punch-up with team-mate Graeme Hogg in a friendly at
Stark's Park last year cost him a 10-match SFA ban -- and to this day,
he still can't explain, even to his wife Carol, what got into him,
writes Jim Reynolds.
''To be honest, I felt hard done by with the ban,'' he said. ''I made
a mistake, owned up to it, and said I was sorry. Now a precedent has
been set as regards anything which happens from now on.
''It was something which happened in the heat of the moment, it's as
simple as that. There were a lot of things said about bad blood between
Hoggy and I, but that was a lot of nonsense. We got on very well. We
still do, although I haven't seen him much since his move to Notts
County.
''There was a lot of pressure on the club at the time. We had a new
manager, we'd just been hammered by Middlesbrough in a friendly, we'd
just escaped relegation the season before, I was the captain, and we
weren't playing very well that night anyway.
''It's something I regret and something which will certainly never
happen again.
''There are no excuses for what I did. I was in the wrong and deserved
to be punished, although I always hoped it wouldn't lead to me leaving
Hearts, even though I was stripped of the captaincy and put on the
transfer list.
''Injury is one thing, but I missed games then because of something I
had done which was causing the team to suffer. I had to take
responsibility for that. The guilt was all mine.
''But it was my one real blemish in 11 years and I didn't feel it
merited being hung out to dry.''
Now the 16 times capped defender has put all that behind him and, once
fit again, has his sights set on a return to the Scotland squad and
playing for another five years at least.
''I feel as if I've got those two-and-a-half years to catch up and if
I'm not still playing in the Premier League when I'm 35, I'll be really
disappointed.''

MICHAEL Watt, who has ousted Dutch internationalist Theo Snelders in
the Pittodrie side's emerging premier division challenge, has been
handed a Euro target.
Scotland manager Craig Brown, who watched Watt in the latest league
victory over Hearts, revealed yesterday: ''He was outstanding. If he
maintains this form he can play his way into my plans.
''I will be taking three keepers to the European Championship finals
and everyone knows who the first two are. The third will be a young
keeper who will benefit from from working with the more experienced
pair. He will then be earmarked to take part in the next World Cup
campaign.''
Watt's qualities are well known to Brown as he was a regular in the
Under-21 team which reached the semi-finals of the last European
Championships.
Meanwhile, Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken reckons his side are ready to
topple Rangers in tomorrow's sell-out clash at Pittodrie. Aitken
insisted: ''The mood here is great and I feel the players are ready for
this latest challenge. It is a great stage for them.
''I know most people will be looking at how we perform before deciding
if we are really back on track, but I won't be judging my players on
this one match. As far as I'm concerned they have been first class since
the season kicked off.
''They are hungry for success, and on this form we are more than
capable of beating Rangers.''
* MANCHESTER United striker Eric Cantona, who returned from an
eight-month suspension last Sunday, has been left out of France's squad
for next week's vital European Championship qualifier in Romania.
Cantona's omission comes despite the fact that France have been
struggling for goals and will be out of contention for the finals if
they fail to win in Bucharest and Poland secure victory on the same
night in Slovakia.

THE Scottish Rugby Union has established a rigorous doping control
programme which means that top internationalists and all Scotland
age-group players can be tested anywhere, at any time, for 12 months of
the year.
Testing for banned stimulants and performance-enhancing drugs has been
routine after international matches for a number of years. However, last
season, the SRU introduced an out-of-competition testing procedure for
all national squad players.
Now, the anti-drug measures have been extended to include all players
involved at under-21, under-19, and under-18 international age groups,
and yesterday SRU administrative secretary Gregor Nicholson said that
the union was at the ''leading edge'' of doping control.
''We have extended the programme, not because of any fear on our part
that the use of illegal drugs is a problem within the sport in Scotland,
but because it helps to educate the players and because it undoubtedly
acts as a deterrent,'' he added.
The advent of the professional game has given rise to fears that
illegal drug use could become more prevalent as the rewards open to
players increase and, this week, the International Board announced that
drug control procedures would be enhanced and rigorously applied.
Yesterday, the Italian Rugby Federation announced that Italian
internationalist Claudio de Rossi had been suspended after having tested
positive for a banned drug at a training session earlier this month.
He added that de Rossi, a full back with the Benetton Treviso club,
had been banned for taking the steroid, nandrolone. A second urine
sample would be analysed on October 17.
Nicholson said that all Scotland squad players and age-group players
had to sign a consent form which meant that they could be visited by
doping control officers at any time.
''The tests are carried out in conjunction with the Scottish Sports
Council and all samples are sent to King's College in London for
analysis'' he added.
Players can be asked to provide urine samples at squad sessions, after
club games or, even, in their own homes.
''The system means that the player will not know when the testers
might arrive.
''The decision to carry out out-of-season tests was taken because, if
a player was abusing steroids, then he would be likely to do so during
the close-season. That is when he would derive most benefit.
''There are a number of over-the-counter medicines which players are
not allowed to take in a match situation but we don't test for those in
out-of-competition situations.
''The close-season tests are designed to counter the use of steroids
and performance-enhancing drugs like that.
''Within the home unions, the SRU has given a lead with regard to
doping control programmes because we are determined that the game should
remain drug free,'' said Nicholson.

<HEADLINE>Celtic outbid Blackburn to land McKinlay for #1.8m</HEADLINE>

McNamara a future leader of the Parkhead band.
SCOTLAND midfield player Billy McKinlay is set to join Celtic in a
#1.8m deal which was finalised yesterday between his club, Dundee
United, and the Parkhead side.
Celtic manager Tommy Burns promised he was ready to spend more money
after completing the signing of Jacky McNamara from Dunfermline on
Wednesday afternoon.
By the time the McNamara deal was completed, Burns had made his moves
to hijack McKinlay from under the noses of English Premiership champions
Blackburn Rovers. The Lancashire side, backed by owner Jack Walker's
millions, had offered just more than #1.5m early in the week.
They are believed to have increased that in their efforts to capture
McKinlay, but Burns and Celtic topped their offer, and yesterday
Tannadice chairman Jim McLean informed them that they had permission to
talk to the player.
I understand that McKinlay was told of that decision and is now
awaiting the signing offer from the Glasgow side he supported as a
schoolboy. Last night he was engaged in talks at Parkhead with Burns and
his advisers.
The player has wanted to leave Tannadice since last season and is
currently pursuing an action against them in the Court of Session over
the legality of the long-term contract he claims he was forced to sign
when he was a teenager.
That deal is due to end in the summer after running its
eight-year-long course -- and, now, as he faces the last few months of
his Tannadice ''sentence,'' the player will get the move he has long
wanted.
Burns moved swiftly to add the burgeoning talents of McKinlay to his
already powerful midfield area. Being able to beat off the bid from
Blackburn must demonstrate to Celtic fans the manager's determination to
add quality to the squad.
Inevitably, of course, this will add to the rumours surrounding the
future of John Collins. As far as I can see, Collins is sure to go and
the money generated by that sale -- and Middlesbrough remain favourites
to sign the player -- will be used to bring in other players.
Jacky McNamara, the Scotland under-21 internationalist, has cost the
club #600,000, and as Burns stressed yesterday: ''He is a player for the
future. I watched him last season and felt he needed maybe another year
with Dunfermline. Now he is ready to step up and that's why we have
signed him.''
McNamara's move has already been pushed into the background by the
decisive way Burns has set up the McKinlay move. A year ago no-one would
have believed that Celtic would be able to top Blackburn in any transfer
deal. But that is what Burns has done over the last hectic 48 hours.
In the close season Celtic failed to sign Gordan Petric from Tannadice
after behind-the-scenes delays which angered Burns. This time everything
is in place and the Parkhead money men must deliver in the wake of their
manager's admirable wheeling and dealing.
There is little doubt that United would have wanted to keep McKinlay,
but with a court case pending and the player obviously unhappy, a
transfer was the only way out of the impasse.
In the meantime, Celtic captain Paul McStay, who missed the midweek
victory over Falkirk, has been withdrawn from the Scotland squad which
travels to Stockholm next week to play Sweden in a friendly
international.
McKinlay is in that squad and could be in line to win his first
international cap as a Celtic player.

DUNDEE United manager Billy Kirkwood will use the money from the sale
of Billy McKinlay to Celtic to finance his efforts to bring a striking
edge to his side's premier division challenge.
Former Airdrie striker Owen Coyle, now at Bolton, is having talks with
Kirkwood, who is also interested in Gary McSwegan, the former Ibrox
frontman now with Notts County. The English club, however, are believed
to have raised their fee for McSwegan during negotiations.
The deals would cost the Tayside club around #800,000, with the two
strikers carrying the same price tag, and Kirkwood would like to
complete the double signing in time for tomorrow's clash with Dumbarton
at Boghead.
Kirkwood made it clear last night that United have not made an
increased offer for Blackpool striker Tony Ellis, who was on the verge
of signing last week before his club upped the asking price.

ENGLISH COCA-COLA CUP
LOU Macari yesterday celebrated Stoke City's plum Coca-Cola Cup
third-round draw at home to Newcastle United like a reluctant lottery
winner.
''I didn't dare tell the players at Chelsea just how desperate the
club was for them to win,'' admitted Macari. ''We are so skint that a
cup run is the only way I can see any light at the end of the tunnel.''
But it will take an even bigger sensation than their 1-0 win at
Stamford Bridge for Stoke to stay in the prize fund.
While the Potteries club hit a minor jackpot against the Premiership
leaders, the draw was not so kind to second-division giant-killers York
and Bradford, who both face difficult away ties, nor third-division
Bury, who travel to Reading.
York, who knocked out Manchester United, have a trip to the capital to
face Queen's Park Rangers, while Bradford City, who beat UEFA Cup
contenders Nottingham Forest, visit first division Norwich City.
There are a number of intriguing games between first division teams
and Premiership opposition.
Watford entertain champions Blackburn Rovers, Derby County meet Leeds,
Millwall face Sheffield Wednesday, and Barnsley take on Arsenal.
Holders Liverpool meet Manchester City in one of three all-Premiership
ties, with Coventry facing Spurs and Southampton entertaining West Ham.
Millwall, who knocked out FA Cup holders Everton, have the chance of
claiming another Premiership scalp in Sheffield Wednesday at The New
Den. Draw:
Stoke City v Newcastle United, Watford v Blackburn Rovers, Reading v
Bury, Queen's Park Rangers v York City, Coventry City v Tottenham
Hotspur, Southampton v West Ham United, Derby County v Leeds United,
Millwall v Sheffield Wednesday, Birmingham City v Tranmere Rovers,
Wolverhampton Wanderers v Charlton Athletic, Bolton Wanderers v
Leicester City, Crystal Palace v Middlesbrough, Norwich City v Bradford
City, Barnsley v Arsenal, Aston Villa v Stockport County, Liverpool v
Manchester City (ties to be played week commencing October 23).

IPSWICH Town yesterday completed the #300,000 signing of central
defender Tony Mowbray from Celtic.
Mowbray, who has signed a contract that will keep him at Ipswich until
the summer of 1998, is expected to make his debut in tomorrow's home
match against Wolverhampton.
''I really hope I can play a part in bringing success and Premiership
football back to Ipswich Town,'' said Mowbray.
Manager George Burley said he had been trying to sign the player since
the summer. ''He is a leader on the field and a good organiser. He is a
professional in the Terry Butcher mould and will give us a very strong
backbone.''

By FREDDIE McLEOD, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, SCOTTISH RUGBY UNION
THE historic decisions which were taken in principle in Paris last
August at the special meeting of the International Rugby Football Board
to repeal the existing bye-laws of the board and also the regulations
relating to amateurism undoubtedly has changed the face of the game
forever.
These principles were subsequently ratified in Tokyo last weekend. To
those ''at the coal face'' the agreements reached were, perhaps, not a
major surprise, although the extent of the change undoubtedly surprised
many observers.
Having served on the working party on amateurism over the past 18
months, even I was surprised at the ultimate outcome, although I have to
say that I have accepted the reality of the situation for quite some
time.
The council made its decision on the basis of a basic principle that
''if you can't control then you don't attempt to regulate.''
The regulations relating to amateurism are now permissive rather than
exclusionary. Additionally, they are not mandatory and there is no
reason why any union cannot maintain an amateur game within its
jurisdiction. At the end of the day, control ultimately rests with the
individual union and each union may put in place more restrictive
regulations providing that they are not in conflict with the board's
regulations.
Although the new regulations permit any person who is, or has been at
any time, involved in the game to receive material benefit, clearly the
key parties are now the unions, the clubs, and the players. That having
been said, it would be naive to ignore the changed status of medics,
referees, touch judges, coaches, selectors and, indeed, administrators.
At the end of the day it is important that the Scottish Rugby Union
does what is best for Scottish rugby. It has to canvass the widest
possible view and not bow to pressures from small groups. It believes
that this can best be achieved by negotiation and not confrontation.
Meetings are, therefore, being arranged with all the key parties
involved over the coming weeks.
Clearly, a game where there is a requirement to provide a material
benefit requires cash. One must, therefore, welcome new opportunities to
bring money into the game but, that having been said, it must be done in
a controlled way and not through entrepreneurs who have no knowledge of
the game and are driven by other motives without any consideration for
the ethos of the game.
I have not spoken to anyone yet who is not concerned that the whole
ethos of the game might be at risk and there is a strong desire to
protect that situation.
It is clear that recent events in Newcastle will be a threat to the
Scottish game if some of our leading players do decide to play club
rugby south of the Border. These players will have to bear in mind that,
if they wish to play international rugby, they must be in a position to
fulfil their obligations under their contract with the SRU.
Additionaly, the IRFB has established within its new regulations a
provision that the union takes preference over any club and,
additionally, any contract to be entered into by a club must be
registered with an individual union. I am sure that the RFU will have
something to say about a large number of Scottish players playing in one
club in the North of England. That having been said, any team can only
field 15 players at one time and perhaps we should not over react at
this stage.
Control of movement of players will, therefore, be vital.
Consideration will have to be given to European legislation and
restraint of trade legislation before any clear picture emerges.
In England at present, there is a 120-day registration period before
players can play for a club in national competitions. Unfortunately,
registration does not result in a need to reside in the area or country
in question.
One should be aware that control of movement of players must take
account of movement between the home countries and not just between
overseas countries and the home countries.
At present the ''eligibility'' regulations remain unchanged. There is,
undoubtedly, a desire on the part of the IRFB council to control a free
gangway between unions. Once a player has elected to play for a union
then he should, in my view, be restricted to playing for that union in
the future.
After Paris, I had considerable fears for agents coming into the game.
That has now been lessened. I believe agents are principally interested
in big transfer fees and big salaries and, clearly, that will not be the
case in our game at this stage. No-one is in a position to be held to
ransom and contracts will be offered and either accepted or rejected.
That will be the choice of the individual.
On the positive side, there is no doubt that international players
will now have an opportunity to receive a reasonable reward for their
dedication and commitment to the game.
The SRU actively encourages players to remain in employment and have
rugby as a secondary source of income.
Apart from their contracts with the union, and, at a later date
possibly with clubs, players can receive substantial rewards from what
has commonly become known as ''off-the-field'' activities. Top players
will, in future, certainly move into a new standard of living.
Rugby football has changed for ever. There are, undoubtedly, stormy
waters to be crossed in the years ahead. This will call for regular and
constructive talks with all parties involved.
In the future, the game will almost certainly be run by a different
type of administrator. That having been said, more than 99% of players
will be unaffected by the change and those who have voluntarily given
their services over many years should not be downhearted by the change.
Change was inevitable and the realities of the situation have now been
addressed.

GIANT centre Barrie-Jon Mather has emerged from an injury nightmare to
line up for England against World Cup holders Australia at Wembley
tomorrow -- something which a year ago would not have seemed possible.
The 6ft 7in Mather starred in Wigan's famous World Club Challenge
defeat of Brisbane Broncos last summer, but was sidelined for months
after having surgery on a troublesome shoulder. In only his second
comeback game near the end of last year, he damaged knee ligaments.
A summer stint in Australia with Perth Western Reds rekindled his
career. His performances there and with Wigan in the current campaign
have resulted in his England call-up.
Australia are 4-11 favourites with Ladbrokes to win the World Cup
opener, with England 9-4. The Kangaroos are also 1-3 favourites to keep
the trophy, with England 10-3.

THE Border Reivers rugby league hopefuls expect a decision from RFL HQ
in Leeds today on their application to become Scotland's first serious
league side with a base at the Fairydean football ground in Galashiels.
The plan to set up a semi-professional rugby league club in the
Borders has been doing the media rounds for just over a week. Thus far,
the consortium of businessmen who are said to be backing the venture
have kept a low profile.
The club spokesman is Penicuik businessman Bob Jamieson, who is now a
sports marketing consultant but who previously operated the Novafone
cellular telephone air-time company and was involved in a sponsorship
capacity with Dundee and Hearts football clubs.
Yesterday he said that the Reivers' application for entry into the RL
second division would be discussed in Leeds today and that he expected
the proposal to be rubber-stamped by the game's governing body. He would
not, though, say who was behind the venture.
Jamieson added that with rugby league about to transform itself into a
summer game next season, there was no reason why Border rugby union
players should not play the XV-a-side game during the winter and then
switch to league for the summer.
''The Border Reivers will be semi-professional, so nobody is going to
get rich, but I would see this as a means whereby the rugby union clubs
in the Borders, who face having their star men lured away for money to
England, could keep their players at home,'' he said.
However, this does not take account of the fact that the rugby union
authorities do not want to see players to-ing and fro-ing between codes
and that, certainly in England and Scotland, there is likely to be
legislation in place soon which will stipulate a stand-down period when
players switch codes. Whether this legislation would pass muster in the
event of a restraint-of-trade legal challenge is, for the moment, a
matter for conjecture.
This very point may well be tested in Scotland within the next 24
hours. Colin Paxton, an ex-Hawick player who signed professionally for
the Carlisle rugby league club four years ago, is now out of contract
and back in his home town, where he wants to play for a Hawick
Harlequins side tomorrow.
Paxton, 24, a cousin of Jed-Forest and Scotland scrum half Gary
Armstrong, last played for Carlisle in March, which means that, in any
case, he has served more than the 120 days ''quarantine'' period which
SRU International Board representative Fred McLeod favours.
Until it has held an extraordinary general meeting at which it will
put in place new bye-laws and regulations, and since the amateurism
regulations were officially consigned to oblivion by the IB in Tokyo
last weekend, the SRU finds itself in a state of limbo, therefore it is
unclear whether or not Paxton would be in breach of Union regulations if
he played for the Quins seconds against Selkirk thirds.
''I don't want to do anything which will get me or Harlequins in
trouble, but I want to play rugby again. However, before I do anything I
had better get the all-clear from Murrayfield,'' he said yesterday.
With the Rugby League World Cup due to kick off at Wembley tomorrow,
what used to be termed ''the professional code'' is currently flavour of
the week.
This weekend a Scotland league side, which is playing in an ''emerging
nations'' tournament to run in tandem with the Centenary World Cup, will
undergo a two-day training session at Croft Park in Kelso and will
parade at Hampden Park on Monday for a major sponsorship announcement.
The Scotland side, made up mainly of students and expatriate Scots, is
captained by the ex-Kelso and Scotland centre Alan Tait, who still has a
base in his home town despite achieving great success with Leeds and the
Great Britain side.
Tait broke through into the Scotland side at the World Cup in 1987 and
won the last of his eight caps at the end of the Five Nations'
tournament the following year. He has been an outstanding performer at
full back for Leeds and the GB side. What price Tait ending his career
in the No.15 shirt for Scotland, now that Gavin Hastings has gone?
Probably the price would be too high, which yesterday appeared to be
exactly the case as regards the former Welsh fly-half Jonathan Davies.
In this new professional era, the Cardiff rugby union side has been
negotiating with Warrington in an attempt to lure Davies back to Wales.
However, Warrington told Cardiff yesterday that they will allow the
33-year-old Welsh RL skipper to return to rugby union -- but only with a
hefty compensation payment.
Warrington chief executive Graham Armstrong, who met his Cardiff
counterpart Gareth Davies on Wednesday, said: ''Jonathan is under
contract with us until June 1997. He is not on the transfer list and is
not for sale. If ever he did leave, we would insist on compensation on
top of his contract payments.''
The Cardiff chief executive said: ''Both parties now know the facts
and now it is up to Warrington to discuss it and come back to me, which
they will probably do next week. But there is no big money in Wales to
buy contracts and Cardiff cannot afford to buy Jonathan out.''

SNOOKER
JOHN Parrott emphasised his expertise on the overseas circuit
yesterday with a 5-3 quarter-final victory over John Higgins in the
Thailand Classic in Bangkok.
Former world champion Parrott has won three ranking events on foreign
soil as well as a handful of invitation tournaments, and he now faces
Stephen Hendry for a place in tomorrow's final.
The Liverpudlian prevented an all-Scottish semi-final with a solid
performance, seizing on Higgins' mistakes in the sixth and seventh
frames to make clearances of 51 and 124.
When the Scot missed a snooker in frame eight to leave a free ball,
Parrott moved in for a quick kill.
Parrott said: ''I think John's inexperience showed in the last frame,
when he took on a red he shouldn't have done. But there is probably more
pressure on him these days, bearing in mind he won three major titles
last season.
''He is going to be around for a long time and, for a youngster, his
safety is so good, which makes my win so much more pleasing.''
The 20-year-old Scot was a disappointed man after missing out on a
confrontation with world champion Hendry.
He said: ''I'll get Stephen some time. But you have to play well to
beat the top players and I didn't today -- I was careless and sometimes
stupid.''
The semi-final will be the twenty-ninth time that Parrott and Hendry

won 11 times.
New Zealand's Dene O'Kane later completed the semi-final line-up when
he beat Worcester's Dave Finbow 5-2.

NO-ONE, it seems, wants to talk about the big game. Neither Bayern
Munich's representative at Stark's Park on Wednesday, Wolfgang Dettmer,
nor Raith Rovers' manager Jimmy Nicholl would volunteer any opinions
about the most anticipated game in the Fife club's history, the UEFA Cup
second-round, first-leg tie at Easter Road in a fortnight's time which
will be screened live by Sky Sports.
Herr Dettmer, who is one of the German club's coaches, wished to keep
his own counsel until nearer the game and Nicholl has made a vow to say
nothing about the match until the Sunday previous.
Nicholl's reason is understandable. He does not want his team's
attention diverted from the important task of collecting premier
division points en route to the big night.
He did not say as much, but one of his star turns, Colin Cameron,
two-goal scorer in their 3-0 win over Hibs, let us in on the secret.
''The manager has told us he wants us to put the Bayern match to the the
back of our minds, to concentrate on our league matches. He doesn't
think it would be sensible to drop points and end up in the bottom two
in the league because of the cup game coming up. Obviously it is always
somewhere in the back of our minds, but it will take care of itself.
''I hope the man from Munich has seen enough to let him think we are
not the pushovers he might have thought.''
After scraping through against the Icelanders, Nicholl was concerned
that the attraction of the Bayern tie would occupy minds and detract
from domestic performances. He might have suspected he was right at the
weekend when the side were thrashed 3-0 by Aberdeen. However, he
confessed that he learned a lesson at Pittodrie. ''We won't be doing
that again, playing all-out attack away from home. I'll never start
thinking we are better than we are,'' he said.
He was pleased with the attitude of his players against Hibs, even if
the 3-0 victory, Rovers' biggest win in the premier division, was a
bonus he had not expected.

SAM Torrance has only to make the halfway cut in the Mercedes German
Masters in Berlin yesterday and he should be well on his way to
achieving his life's ambition of finishing the year as European No.1.
The 42-year-old Scot's chances improved dramatically when Colin
Montgomerie, complaining of tendon trouble in his left wrist, shot a
four-over-par 76 in the first round, and then withdrew from this
lucrative tournament.
Montgomerie leads Torrance by a mere #980 in the Order of Merit with
just this event and the Volvo Masters in Valderrama to come. So if
Torrance can finish reasonably high in the pecking order on Sunday he
should go into a useful lead.
But Torrance did not start particularly well, shooting a one-under-par
71 to finish the day in joint fifty-first place -- seven behind the
Swedish trio of Klas Eriksson, Per-Ulrik Johansson and Anders Forsbrand,
and South African Retief Goosen, who all shot 64s.
Montgomerie began his round well enough with two birdies in his first
three holes but then he began to fall away.
Despite his good start and then reaching the turn in a one-under-par
36, the Scot could not keep it up.
He had a 6 at the long thirteenth and then dropped four shots in his
last three holes for a disastrous 76, a score that only six other
players in the 105-strong field failed to beat.
''I have had this problem for about five weeks,'' said Montgomerie.
''It's all down to playing too much but I've been loth to stop playing
because I want that No.1 spot. But a short rest will do me good.''
Torrance was amazed when he heard that Montgomerie had withdrawn,
saying: ''I had no idea because he didn't even tell me at the Ryder Cup
when we played together on the second day. But I suppose he said nothing
then because he didn't want to put negative thoughts into my head.
''He must be knackered because he has been playing so much. I've also
been playing a lot but I'm okay.
''I heard he had dropped out when I had played nine holes and I must
admit I got very tense. But my worst shot was early on when I put a No.5
iron in the water for a double bogey 5 at the short third.''
Torrance, of course, has not forgotten that Bernhard Langer, winner of
the European Open last Sunday, could still overtake him if he won here
and in Valderrama. It's a tall order even though Langer began with an
admirable 67.
Of the four leaders, Eriksson was undoubtedly the most delighted. He
has been suffering from back trouble and is only 129th in the Order of
Merit and in danger of losing his Tour card.
Yesterday, however, was a glory day with seven birdies and an eagle 3
at the fifth on his card, a round he described as ''my best ever''.
(British or Irish unless stated) 64 -- K Eriksson (Sweden), P-U
Johansson (Sweden), A Forsbrand (Sweden), R Goosen (S Africa).
65 -- P Eales
66 -- M-A Jimenez (Spain), R Claydon.
67 -- D J Russell, M Mackenzie, G Turner (New Zealand), S Lyle, B
Langer (Germany), T Lehman (USA), J Sandelin (Sweden), J Haeggman
(Sweden), G Levenson (S Africa), S Tinning (Denmark), S Luna (Spain), P
Hedblom (Sweden).
68 -- S Grappasonni (Italy), J Coceres (Argentina), M-A Martin
(Spain), J Payne, P Mitchell, J Parnevik (Sweden), J Townsend (USA), F
Lindgren (Sweden).
Others included: 69 -- A Coltart, B Marchbank. 71 -- S Torrance, R
Drummond. 72 -- I Woosnam. 73 -- A Hunter, P Lawrie. 75 -- G Orr. 76 --
G Brand Jr. Retired: C Montgomerie (76).

EAMONN Loughran, the WBO welterweight champion, yesterday dismissed
challenger Angel Beltre as ''a stepping stone to great things.''
Loughran makes the fifth defence of his title in Belfast on Saturday
night in a rematch with Beltre after their first encounter in May ended
in a no-contest following an accidental clash of heads.
''As far as I'm concerned, Beltre is just a stepping stone to greater
things for me. Further down the line, I am looking for fights with Gary
Jacobs, Felix Trinidad and Purnel Whitaker,'' said Loughran.

DREW Docherty, the British bantamweight champion from Condorrat, was
yesterday given the best possible incentive for his upcoming title
defence in Glasgow on October 13, when he faces fellow-Scot James
Murray, of Newmains, at the Hospitality Inn.
The European Boxing Union announced yesterday that European champion
Johnny Armour has been ordered to make a mandatory defence of his title
against Docherty.
There are two hurdles to such a meeting, however. Armour must make a
successful voluntary defence against Redha Abbas, of France, in London
on November 29, and Docherty, of course, has to beat Murray.
It is, however, marvellous news for the Condorrat boxer, who made an
unsuccessful challenge for the world title against Ghana's Alfred ''The
Cobra'' Kotey in Cumbernauld in his last fight last February. A quick
route to another world challenge would be to make an impact on the
European scene and a fight between Armour, from London, and the popular
Scot would be a tremendous attraction for British fight fans.
The pair were scheduled to meet more than a year ago, when Armour was
named as a challenger for Docherty's British title, but on the day the
fight was due to go to purse offers, the Londoner pulled out of the
contest. Since then, of course, he has gone on to win the European crown
while Docherty has earned himself outright ownership of a Lonsdale Belt.
Docherty's last attempt at the European title ended in heartbreak in
February of last year, when he was outpointed by the Italian Vincenzo
Belcastro, but he has gained much more experience and confidence since
that night.
There is, however, no chance of Docherty underestimating the task he
faces in Glasgow next week. ''It's good to know that the European Union
rates me as the No.1 contender for Armour's title,'' he said, ''and I
would dearly love another crack at it.
''All my attention at the moment, however, is on next Friday and James
Murray. James will get the same respect from me as any of my previous
opponents and I have trained as hard for this one as I have for any
fight. I let my manager Tommy Gilmour worry about the future while I
concentrate on the present.''
It would be natural to assume that if Murray did become British
champion next week, then he would automatically take Docherty's place
against Armour, but that's not the way things work in boxing. In fact,
my information from Europe is that if Docherty were to lose next week,
then the current No.2 in the European ratings, Russia's Alexander
Wagupov, would then be put forward.
Meantime, Alan McDowall, from Renfrew, aims to put the record straight
next Friday. The 28-year-old lightweight agreed terms yesterday to face
his old foe Peter Till in a supporting bout to the Docherty-Murray
fight.
Last September, McDowall lost his unbeaten record by a half-point
margin to the veteran Walsall boxer.
Said the Scot: ''I took Till on as a late substitute after my British
eliminator fight fell through and perhaps was not properly focused on
the job, but there will be no repeat performance this time.''
Promoter Katherine Morrison also confirmed yesterday that former WBC
light-heavyweight champion Dennis Andries will be featured on the bill,
as will Australian super-heavyweight prospect John McAlpine.

SENIORS LEXUS TROPHY
IRELAND'S Liam Higgins opened his defence of the Senior Pro Am Lexus
Trophy with a three under-par-69 to share the first-round lead in
Switzerland yesterday.
Using a #15 large-headed driver he picked up in a Cork supermarket,
the Waterville-based pro employed his long hitting to good advantage on
the slopes of the Breitenloo Club course near Zurich.
He ran in four birdies -- two of them at par-5s and out of reach of
most of the field -- and made only one bogey, at the short second where
he overshot the green.
Renato Campagnoli, who won the German International Seniors earlier
this year, also shot a 69, having turned in a three-under 33.
Germany-based British professional David Creamer is one of three
players sharing second place on 70.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
69 -- R Campagnoli (Italy), L Higgins.
70 -- D Creamer, R Vines (Australia), J Fourie (S Africa).
71 -- D Butler, V Tshabalala, P Butler, J M Roca (Spain), N Coles, A
Garrido (Spain).
72 -- R Verwey (S Africa), B Waites, M Gregson, T Horton, J Morgan.
Other score: 76 -- D Huish.

McANDREW ROAD RELAY
DENNIS the Menace, Noddy, Rupert Bear, and Cinderella have come to the
aid of the showpiece event of the opening weekend of Scotland's winter
athletics season -- for these four characters are alter egos of Graham
Greenhalgh, area director of Tilcon Shell, whose interest in the sport
has led to his company putting secure foundations under the McAndrew
Relay event at Scotstoun tomorrow.
Greenhalgh has appeared in four different guises in Great Scottish
Runs, recently running amok with a water pistol as Dennis.
It is no mean feat for a 47-year-old to cover the half marathon in 97
minutes wearing fancy dress, and such efforts have raised more than
#2000 for Save The Children. But now his company has saved one of the
leading events on the road calendar.
The previous sponsorship from a catering equipment firm having boiled
dry, Greenhalgh has stepped in with a one-year deal worth, he says,
''around #1200. We'll see how it goes, and if successful, this is likely
to be extended.''
The company, which has a storage depot in Whiteinch, has a tradition
of supporting ''good works'' in the environs of their business, and
Victoria Park's seasonal 4X3[1/4]-mile relay opener is deemed to fall
into that category.
In addition to putting up funds for prizes worth more than #800, they
are presenting new marshall's vests and road safety signs. There are
prizes for men's, women's, and veteran teams, and fastest individuals in
every category.
Greenhalgh came late to athletics. ''I was getting too old and too
slow for rugby -- so I was drawn into the marathon boom of the early
'80s,'' he said.
His son, Chris, eventually quit rugby as well, becoming a
district-standard runner. Last week the pair were in the same team, at
Kilbarchan's relay event, to father's discomfiture.
Chris handed over, embarassingly high up the field, and dad was passed
by one rival after another on the next stage. This weekend father has
taken the precaution of being absent on business!
Shettleston, worthy winners at Kilbarchan, will, however, find stiffer
opposition from the runners-up, Leslie Deans Racing Club, when
tomorrow's race gets underway at 3pm.
Racing will have a considerably improved team, bringing in Ian Brown,
who had a top-10 finish in last weekend's Great Caledonian Run, to join
David Ross and Glen Stewart -- with six other men challenging for the
one remaining place.
Spango Valley have temporarily lost the services of Tom Murray. Tired
after his World Mountain Race silver medal, he has abandoned a marathon
debut in Holland this weekend, but said last night that he was confident
of being back for the West District and national cross-country relay
championships.

WOMEN'S HOME INTERNATIONALS
SCOTLAND, runners-up in the European Women's Team Golf championship in
Milan in the summer, are in grave danger of finishing the four-cornered
Home International series at Wrexham today with the wooden spoon. Only a
miraculous set of results can stop them from ending at the bottom of the
pile. After their 6-3 defeat by holders England on Wednesday, they lost
5-4 to Ireland yesterday.
Now they need to repel the challenge of host nation Wales today and
then hope that Ireland convincingly beat England.
Scotland's fate was virtually sealed in the foursomes, two of which
they lost. They won three and halved one of the singles, but that was
too little too late.
In a key match at the top of the order, Stirling's Alison Rose went
all the way to the wire with Curtis Cup player Eileen Rose Power but
narrowly lost. Power chipped in for a winning birdie 2 at the
seventeenth to put her nose in front and then Rose three-putted the last
-- and that really was curtains.
Jayne Ford stood on the last tee one up on Evan Higgins and needed to
hold on to that advantage to give Scotland a share of the honours. But
she made a mess of it and Higgins got the half which gave Ireland
victory.
England took the foursomes 2-1 against Wales but then lost the singles
4-2 which meant a first-ever victory for Wales in this encounter.
Details:
SCOTLAND v IRELAND
(Scotland names first): Foursomes -- A Rose and L Nicholson lost to E
Higgins and A O'Sullivan, 6 and 5; C Agnew and L Roxburgh lost to Y
Cassidy and S Fanagan, 1 hole; J Ford and S McMaster halved with E R
Power and H Kavanagh. Result -- Scotland [1/2], Ireland 2[1/2].
Singles -- Rose lost to Power, 1 hole; H Monaghan lost to Kavanagh, 1
hole; Nicholson beat O'Sullivan, 2 and 1; McMaster beat Fanagan, 4 and
2; Roxburgh beat Cassidy, 1 hole; Ford halved with Higgins. Result --
Scotland 3[1/2] Ireland 2[1/2].
Match result: Scotland 4, Ireland 5.

PETER Radford, the chief executive of the British Athletics
Federation, yesterday admitted that his sport has made mistakes, but
confidently predicted that the 1995 summer of discontent will not be
repeated.
That is good news, for track and field cannot afford an action replay
of this year's politicking, falling attendances, and financial and
selection wrangling -- especially if Radford's vision is to be realised:
Britain hosting the World championships in 2001 as a possible overture
to bidding for the 2008 Olympic Games.
The former Glasgow University professor, speaking at an end-of-season
review in London, admitted his sport had been over-priced and
inadequately marketed. ''There will be a more co-ordinated promotional
drive, and greater flexibility in ticketing policies,'' he said.
The BAF will not confirm it formally, but is believed to have lost
#370,000 last year, part of a #500,000 loss overall, which will be made
up from reserves. Some 600 tickets were given away, gratis, for the
Kelvin Hall international, which was originally billed as a sell-out,
and more than 2000 in Birmingham.
The absence of Linford Christie, Colin Jackson, and John Regis, with
whom the BAF engaged in a distasteful financial battle, was a
significant contributor to declining gates which saw three summer
meetings given away to an existing sponsor who paid no additional money.
Radford has spoken to the rebel trio. ''I think we will see better
relationships in the coming year,'' he said. ''I don't think that it's
going to become a major prob.''
Christie's conversations with fellow athletes, however, would indicate
otherwise.
Early negotiations will avoid a repetition. ''We will know where we
stand before the season starts,'' said media spokesman Tony Ward. ''We
won't be held to ransom -- we cannot afford to be if we are losing a
six-figure sum.''
Radford believes there is a surfeit of meaningless televised athletics
outside championships. ''It's a bit samey,'' he said. ''After a while
no-one cares who wins -- it's the same races and the same cast.''
He called on the Government for a #10m development grant to run
alongside the federation's bid for the 2001 World championships:
''Overseas countries' governments are pumping considerable sums into
their athletics' federations. If ours will not do that, we have to go
for the National Lottery and press for a change in the laws so it can
fund revenue as well as capital spending.'' But with no legislation
tabled, that cannot come in time for next year's Olympics.
BAF will respond to an internationalist's revolt, revealed exclusively
in these columns, by establishing a forum for airing grievances. There
will with a better elite support system, and Olympic selection policy
will be detailed on November 8.

FORMER Open runner-up John Cook emerged from hibernation to move
within two strokes of the lead after his opening round at the $1.2m Walt
Disney World Golf Classic here yesterday.
Californian Cook, who is a lowly 124th on the US Tour's money list and
in danger of losing his card at the end of the season, had seven birdies
and one bogey in a six-under-par 66 on the Magnolia course at Disney
World.
He is tied for eighth, four strokes behind surprise leader Carl
Paulson, who languishes a miserable 223rd on the money list. Paulson
recorded five straight birdies from the thirteenth on the Palm course to
shoot a 10-under 62, two strokes better than fellow American Keith
Fergus and Australian Craig Parry, a former Scottish Open champion.
Cook, meanwhile, was relieved to put a good score on the board after a
dreadful season during which he has recorded just one top-10 finish, at
Memphis in July. But after five of the past six weeks off, he is
mentally refreshed and ready to play again.
''Mentally I've been a basket case,'' admitted Cook, who bogeyed the
final hole to hand Nick Faldo a one-stroke victory at the 1992 Open at
Muirfield.
''It's been no fun (this year). I've put in a lot of work but nothing
positive has happened. I had to go home and get things worked out.
''I played real well today -- my best this year. I drove it real well,
missed just one fairway and one green, and had it inside 10 feet a bunch
of times.'' Leading scores (US unless stated):
62 -- Carl Paulson. 64 -- Craig Parry (Australia), Keith Fergus. 65 --
Mike Heinen, Jay Delsing, Bob Tway, Steve Lowery.
66 -- Ed Fiori, John Cook, Chris Perry, Russ Cochran, Dan Forsman, Jim
Furyk, Fred Funk, Kelly Gibson, Steve Stricker, Phil Blackmar, Pat
Burke.
Other notables: 67 -- Tom Kite, Hal Sutton, Mark O'Meara, Scott
Simpson. 68 -- Paul Azinger. 69 -- Corey Pavin, Lee Janzen.  70 -- Payne
Stewart. 71 -- Lanny Wadkins. 73 -- David Feherty (N Ireland).

HAMDAN Al-Maktoum should enjoy another good day at Ascot when his
Goalwah can land the featured Bonusprint October Stakes.
On his last visit to the Berkshire course for the Festival meeting,
the Sheikh gained one of his biggest wins of the season courtesy of
Bahri in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes.
And the owner will have been almost equally delighted to see Hiwaya
bounce back to form to take a Listed event there the following day.
Goalwah looks to have been primed by Hiwaya's trainer, Tom Jones, to
scoop another Listed prize today.
The three-year-old has taken longer to learn her trade than her dam,
Sheikh Hamdan's 1000 Guineas runner-up Al Bahathri, and did not even
make her debut until late June.
But she began to make up for lost time with an emphatic five-length
victory in maiden company at Sandown in August.
And she looked well up to winning in a higher grade when a close
third, leading two furlongs out until near the finish, in a
mile-and-a-quarter Listed event on the same course last month.
Lack of stamina seemed to cost Goalwah dear that day and she will be
well suited by this return to a mile.
The filly is open to plenty more improvement on just her fifth
appearance and she can put her turn of speed to good use in what could
well be a moderately run contest.
By contrast, there will be no hanging around in the Studd Challenge
Cup Handicap Chase at Cheltenham.
Last year's winner Egypt Mill Prince, one of the speediest two-milers
in training, is taken on by the front-running Easthorpe and What's In
Orbit in a race sure to be run at a searching gallop.
That could well play into the hands of the six-year-old Time Won't
Wait, who does best when coming from behind.
The gelding did very well for one so young by winning five times in
his first season over fences and is almost certainly still on the
upgrade.
Though out of the handicap here, he has a fine chance to overturn his
elder rivals in a contest which will be run to suit him.
Martin Pipe looks the trainer to follow in the other races at
Cheltenham where he could be set for a hat trick.
Pridwell and Robert's Toy are the clear form choices for the M D Foods
Novices' Chase and Eagle Pest Control Novices' Hurdle respectively.
And last week's Chepstow runner-up James Pigg is a good bet to take
advantage of the weight he receives from unreliable pair Beech Road and
Grange Brake in the Cheltenham Sponsorship Club Handicap Chase.

TOUCHE Ross Gordonians are still smarting from their 2-1 defeat last
Sunday by Insights Inverleith in the national league. They travel to
Edinburgh tomorrow seeking a better result against league leaders
Grange.
The Raeburn Place side now occupy the position Gordonians themselves
held last week, but coach Jimmy Cox said: ''We didn't carry out our team
plan against Inverleith and paid the penalty.''
He promised: ''That won't happen again at Grange.''
Cox conceded: ''We can't afford to drop any further behind and so we
must take something from the game.'' If the northerners do, then the
championship race will hot up with four sides waiting to pounce.
Among them will be Torbrex Wanderers and, surprisingly, Kelburne, who
clash at Murrayfield. Kelburne were expected to spend most of this
campaign out of the limelight as they rebuild their side.
Torbrex demolished the two promotion clubs, Pender Uddingston and
Clydesdale, in their last two games when they amassed a total of 21
goals. Harry Coles, the Kelburne goalkeeper, is relishing the challenge,
and said: ''We will be tested defensively, but if we can get the edge in
midfield then we could get a result.''
Western need to kick-start their title aspirations. They entertain
Insights Inverleith tomorrow and MIM on Sunday and unless they pick up
maximum points then the cup will become their trophy target for the
season.
There will be no respite for Clydesdale and Uddingston. They will be
confronted by Menzieshill and MIM with the last-named still searching
for their first point. Their wait could be over in 24 hours.

HOLDERS and 13 times winners of the title Western Klick Photopoint are
free from competition in the National League tomorrow, so two of the
pretenders to their throne -- Edinburgh Ladies and Bonagrass Grove --
have the opportunity to occupy centre stage.
They are in direct opposition at Cramond but both are unable to call
on their recognised sides.
Edinburgh are worse affected. Carrie Corcoran is injured, Jan Gibson,
has an Irish international commitment, and centre back Diane Renilson
also could be sidelined.
Renilson, the club captain, was training with Great Britain all this
week and her prospects will depend on how her ankle injury has stood up.
Should Renilson be a non-starter then Grove captain Audrey Sime will
fancy her side's chances. First the Midlanders will have to stop
Renilson's Great Britain colleague Rhona Simpson, who is averaging three
goals a game this season, her best spell for the club. Grove, who will
be without Karen Humphreys and Karen Barr, may have to settle for a
share of the spoils.
Susan Gilmour, the Scottish international, graduated from Heriot Watt
University in July but she is now back as a teacher-instructor. She will
be captaining the students this winter but it's unlikely they will make
a winning start to their programme against Royal High Gymnasts who have
Sarah Taylor, Val Neil, and Mandy Channing in brilliant form.
The two remaining games should see Hyndland improve their goal
difference at the expense of Boroughmuir, while Western A should pick up
their first point when they take on newly promoted Menzieshill.

MARTIN Heath will not be considered as a player for Scotland until he
promises there will be no more breaches of the code of conduct, the
Scottish Squash Association said yesterday.
The association's statement follows the player's recent remark that he
would not play for Scotland ''until there is a change in team manager''.
The statement read: ''Martin Heath's attitudes and actions at this
year's European Championships were reported to the executive committee
of Scottish Squash, and it was found that he had been in breach of
Scottish Squash's code of conduct.
''He was advised of the outcome of the executive committee's hearing,
and was requested to provide assurances that there would be no
recurrence of these breaches at future international events.
''As he declined to give the necessary assurances, Scottish Squash is,
therefore, unable to consider Martin Heath for international selection
until the assurances are forthcoming.''
The world championships in Egypt next month is the first event from
which Heath, the Scottish No.2, is excluded. Team manager Pat Nicol,
father of the world No.4, Peter (who is unavailable due to other
tournament commitments) has selected a side of Alasdair Taylor, Dave
Gordon, Alan Thomson and Barry Sutherland.

THE Great Britain 21 and under women's team established a 4-0 lead
over their American counterparts after yesterday's opening matches in
the Maureen Connolly Challenge, presented by A D T Auctions at the
Scotstoun Leisure Centre in Glasgow.
Lucy Ahl got Britain off to the best possible staft when she survived
a two-and-and-a-half-hour marathon with Texan student Farley Taylor. The
diminutive Devonian, a member of the British team which won this fixture
9-2 in Stirling in 1993, broke serve in the fifth game and went on to
pocket the first set 6-4. Her 20-year-old opponent reeled off the next
four games before taking the second set 6-2. Ahl, ranked more than 400
places above Taylor at No.311 on the WTA computer, found herself 3-0
down in the final set but broke back in the fifth game and went on to
serve for the match at 5-4 and at 6-5.
The British No.6 squandered two match points in the twelfth game but
broke Taylor again in the fifteenth and converted her fifth match point
for a 6-4, 2-6, 9-7 victory. Ahl, who had wrist surgery two months ago
and was forced to adopt a single-handed back hand, said: ''I was just
glad to get that one. I'd have been so mad if I had lost.''
Mandy Wainwright, resplendent in a Union Jack bandana, survived an
early break in her match with another Texan student Marissa Catlin and
later staved off two set points at 6-4 down in the tie break before
clinching it with a forehand volley on the fourteenth point.
The 19-year-old from Chingford, who won through six qualifying rounds
to reach the main draw at Wimbledon this year, broke twice to establish
a 4-1 lead in the second set, but her 17-year-old opponent narrowed the
gap to 4-3 before Wainwright held serve in the tenth game to secure a
7-6, 6-4 victory when Catlin netted a simple forehand.
The Essex player, currently ranked seventh in Britain and world
No.343, admitted she had considered quitting the game three months ago.
She said: ''After Wimbledon I had to make a big decision as to whether I
should carry on playing or not. I'd been struggling for a while and
there were a lot of things I wanted to change in my game. Instead of
using my strength I was just running around the court defending. I could
hit out in practice, but in matches I was freezing. Today's match was
good for me.''
Lizzie Jelfs completed a hat trick of singles wins for Britain when
she outplayed Kristin Sanderson in an entertaining all-court battle.
Making her senior debut for Britain, the 19-year-old from Banbury gave a
determined and polished performance against one of America's top
juniors, saving two set points at 5-4 down in the first set on her way
to a 7-6, 6-2 victory. Jelfs, who replaced Clare Wood as Britain's No.1
when her world ranking improved to 213 in August, said: ''I thought I
played really well today and it's great to get a win in my debut
match.''
Wainwright then teamed up with debutante Kate Warne-Holland to
complete the day's whitewash. The British pair recovered from a 4-1
first-set deficit to beat Catlin and Sandy Sureephong 6-4, 6-4.

Stewart Fraser on patrol in calm waters
WITH an estimated two million day visitors to Loch Lomond in a year,
it's pretty obvious the place is popular.
Kids go splashing in the shallows. Anglers enjoy the fishing. It's
fine for wind surfing, for dinghies or for sailboats. Motor cruisers can
enjoy the scenery, and there are speedboats, together with powerful --
but pretty noisy -- jet skis.
The Loch Lomond Park Authority has a spanking new Targa 25, about
#85,000 when fully kitted out, on station all year round. The idea is to
be visible and available to encourage sensible use of the loch, to give
guidance and advice on safety, and to carry out the important basic
management of loch and lochside resources.
Going on patrol with the boat shows the range of work carried out. The
Targa's medium-V GRP hull takes a 6-litre 6-cylinder turbo diesel,
giving 213 bhp at 2500 rpm and a cruising speed of 20 knots.
A deep gunwhale gives a feeling of safety, and there is a roof-mounted
light if required. The hydraulic steering system takes a little getting
used to, but an enclosed cabin, with heater to keep the screen clear,
makes for safe manoeuvring.
In front of the wheel are banks of switches and fuses, with good
storage space and handrails in a predominantly varnished wood finish.
There's space for charts -- and for making coffee, too.
Communication is an important aspect of Park Ranger work, explaining
the incorporation of marine band VHF, CB radio, and mobile telephone
with the authority's own radio system.
Early warning of a woodland fire in summer comes within the Ranger
remit. Assisting in any emergency is obviously normal practice, yet the
official rescue boat is not the Targa but another craft at Luss, a few
yards from their own pier-based pontoon.
What about the binoculars, video camera, and 35mm SLR -- with a laptop
computer to be fitted shortly? That has to do with making sure people
are safe, and with the authority's annual registration scheme for
power-driven pleasure boats. The computer will keep a database of those
registered.
It's a softly-softly approach. Registration is free. Registration
labels are free. An information pack is free. And, strictly speaking,
there are at present no bye-laws to be followed. Proposals are still
with the Scottish Secretary.
But increasing concern at the potential danger of unrestricted, and
sometimes thoughtless, use of the loch and the lochside suggests
bye-laws will come in shortly. Speed restrictions will apply. A 50mph
maximum does not seem unreasonable.
Yet the Targa is not a police boat, and any prosecution would be
through the normal procedure of police and procurator fiscal. Still, the
Targa's radar, calibrated speed log and distance equipment can indicate
who is doing what, where and when.
The video hydrograph, on the other hand, gives a better picture of the
loch's under-water topography. The old blue buoyage system has been
replaced, by the Rangers, with the red and green cans and cones familiar
to those sailing round the coast.
Cardinal marks have been introduced, to give clear warning of hazards,
from hidden rocks to shelving banks. As we made our way round the
islands, past a myriad of bays, closer inspection showed how wise it was
to follow the channels marked.
Despite our relatively shallow 2ft 9in draught, a careless move at
speed could easily have ripped the hull on rocks invisible until close
at hand.
Even on a boisterous day there were enthusiasts out in canoes,
reefed-down sailboats, and power boats towing skiers in a whirl of
spray. With no interference among the different groups, individual
enjoyment was straightforward.
As the Rangers point out, improved facilities will encourage even more
people to enjoy the pleasures of Loch Lomond. To retain a beautiful and
worthwhile environment means everyone playing their part, accepting
reasonable rules, and letting a wide variety of users have safe and
sensible enjoyment.
The Targa is set up expressly to help in that aim.

ONE of the most exotic cars doing the rounds of the autumn motor shows
is the Renault Initiale -- the latest concept car put forward by Patrick
Le Quement and his team at Renault Design to show the trend of their
thinking as the twenty-first century looms.
It may have references, in its exterior lines, to the prestige 40CV
saloon built during the 1920s, but the Initiale is ultra-modern in all
other respects. The only two outside suppliers of non-technical
equipment mentioned in Renault's publicity about the car are the
Scottish firm Bridge of Weir Leather, and Louis Vuitton, which designed
the fitted luggage. Not bad company.
The one-off Initiale involvement was just a gloss on the contract
which Bridge of Weir Leather recently signed with Renault. The main
thrust of it is the requirement to supply upholstery for no fewer than
15,300 top-of-the-range Lagunas and Safranes over the next 12 months.
Like BoW's existing work for Volvo, Saab, Honda and Chrysler UK, the
Renault deal was concluded in the face of intense competition.
Leather upholstery is increasingly seen as a desirable luxury and
executive car option, and it is significant that one US leather supplier
has opened a branch in Britain to tap into the European market.
Most top-ranking saloons have leather trim on the availability list,
while the old grumbles about its being cold in cold weather and hot in
hot are being countered to some extent by the provision of heated seats
in the first case, and air conditioning in the second.
Some luxury car-builders tend to make their front seats too wide, and
there is no doubt that something like billiard chalk would be handy, in
those cars, to stop the occupants sliding around. However, leather
upholstery and other trim has become more and more stylish in recent
years.
Although it is involved in many kinds of leather products -- including
upholstery for Concorde, the House of Commons and the QEII -- Bridge of
Weir has been supplying car companies since the 1920s.
Renault's conditions, before signing the latest contract, were the
toughest managing director Jonathan Muirhead can remember, not only in
terms of quality and price, but also in their fixation about testing. As
well as all the other requirements, one sample from every day's
production has to be sent to a textile institute in France. Renault's
environmental demands are also exhaustive. The water tapped from the
Gryfe to supply the factory, however, already goes back into the river
clean.
Supplying leather to car makers was once a fairly casual business.
Things are very different now. BoW has its own research and development
department, which employs three times as many people as it did a decade
years ago.
Processes, grains and patterns are being constantly tested and
refined. Discreet multi-coloured leather trim -- even tartan -- is now
available. And the present head of his family firm, Jonathan Muirhead,
has made it much more outgoing, to the extent that 90 per cent of its
production is for export.
He himself attends major exhibitions like the Geneva Motor Show. A
researcher keeps in touch with the industry's future trends. Brochures
dated 1996 are already well out of date. Bridge of Weir works at least
three years ahead in colours, patterns and textures of upholstery,
visiting individual car companies to show perhaps 40 designers,
engineers and marketing people at one time what lines it has to offer
for future model years.
Proving how well it is regarded, it has even been able, in a canny
cost-saving move, to run joint seminars attended by design teams from
rival manufacturers.
This is an unflamboyant but very experienced company, which has
occupied its present site since 1905. It plays its Scottish cards well,
not least in the titles of its various leather types -- Angus, Lomond,
Highland, Balmoral, Caledonian, and so on. Its first motor industry
contract, in the 1920s, was to supply leather upholstery for the Model T
Ford. A plum contract in the 1950s was for the Lincoln Continental.
The workforce has just increased from 130 to 190, largely as a result
of the Renault contract, which took four years to negotiate.
Bridge of Weir processes no fewer than 10,000 cattle hides, all from
UK sources, every week. It has invested in expensive state-of-the-art
equipment, although much of the specialised work is still done by hand.
And it is keeping pace with the motor industry's most imaginative
designers.

A VERY popular pioneering make, as far as members of the Veteran Car
Club are concerned, is the De Dion Bouton. More than 200 examples of
this French car are listed in the VCC register.
Georges Bouton provided the mechanical expertise, while the finance
came from Count Albert de Dion, an aristocrat of lightthebluetouchpaper
temperament.
The story goes that, having installed a girlfriend in a Paris
apartment, he unexpectedly visited her one day while she was
entertaining another gentleman. After a furious row, the Count started
hurling furniture, including the piano, out of the apartment's
firstfloor window.
He and Bouton made excellent cars, though, and one of the most
spectacular examples is George McCartney's 1912 DI model Landaulette. It
has what some enthusiasts like to call the patina of age about it, but
in fact came into its present ownership about 15 years ago as a chassis
and the proverbial pile of bits.
As secretary of the Scottish section of the VCC, George McCartney has
tackled several oldcar jobs, but never one on the scale of this De Dion
rebuild -- more like a recreation.
In fact, his car is now a VCCauthenticated replica. Claiming no
qualifications other than Olevel woodwork, he examined coachbuilding
records in Glasgow's Mitchell Library and in London, and started to
build a body from scratch.
George's 12year project, abandoned from time to time, included the
moment when he looked at the almost completed body and realised the
proportions were just not right. At this point, a restorer of antique
furniture was commissioned to finish the job and add the ''twiddly
bits''. When the body came back, it was so high that the door of
George's garage had to be lifted off to let it in!
Despite its imposing dimensions, standing seven feet from road to roof
level, the car has only a 2.5litre engine to propel itself. It can put
up a good show against a 30mph urban limit and, with a certain amount of
teethclenching, hit an approximate 40.
George McCartney does not believe that a veteran car should be a
museum piece. His De Dion is driven on events like the RSAC Veteran,
Vintage and Classic Run, and turns out from time to time as a wedding
car.  It certainly adds a touch of class to the Lanarkshire roads.

BASED on one of the most dramatic mountain landscapes in Europe, here
is a drive which features spectacular scenery, hill and forest walks, a
touch of history, and recollections of two unexpected industries. Not
forgetting the goats' milk icecream at North Ballachulish.
Start at the National Trust for Scotland visitor centre, open daily,
beside the A82 in Glencoe. It has presentations on wildlife, geology,
mountaineering and the massacre of the Macdonalds of Glencoe. For later
reference, buy the Great Walks leaflets numbered 4 and 5.
The centre's rooftop viewing platform looks across to the formidable
Clachaig Gully. A footbridge over a tumbling gorge leads to pleasant
woodland paths on An Torr and Signal Rock.
Leaving the centre, turn left on the A82 and take the first left,
signed for Clachaig Hotel. Watch for walkers on the road. Just before a
30mph limit, turn right into a hospital driveway, then bear right on a
gravel road to the forest walk car park.
There are three fine walking routes here. One goes round an ornamental
lochan flanked by Corsican pines. Another offers beautiful views over
Loch Leven, and the third climbs the forested lower slopes of the Pap of
Glencoe.
Back on the public road, turn right through Glencoe village, where the
thatched cottage museum is closed for the season. Turn right on to the
B863 for Kinlochleven and follow this road, originally built by German
prisoners of war, high above Loch Leven. Watch for an unsignposted
picnic site on the left which is another excellent loch and mountain
viewpoint.
Kinlochleven Community Museum, open on weekdays, is also a walking
centre with information on all the hill routes high above the village.
Further on, the modern library accommodates a visitor centre featuring
the aluminium industry which created Kinlochleven in the first place,
and is still operational today. The centre is open daily, but not on
Sundays or Mondays after midOctober.
Beyond the river bridge, a road on the right leads to the Grey Mare's
waterfall walk. Elsewhere, there are signs for the West Highland Way,
which dips down into Kinlochleven before its final climb to Glen Nevis
and Fort William.
Continue on the B863 along the tidal water's edge. In North
Ballachulish turn left on to the A82, pausing for a moment to wonder if
this is Scotland's finest main road Tjunction view, away over Loch
Linnhe to the hills of Ardgour and Sunart.
Take the first left, signed for the confectionery factory visitor
centre. Open six days a week, except in January, it explains how the 24
flavours of Islay tablet are made.
Back on the A82, turn left across the bridge, and straight on at a
roundabout. Take the side road right signed for Ballachulish, and
immediately turn right again to the information centre, with its display
on the longgone slate industry which made Ballachulish famous. It is
open daily till October 15.
Go back to the A82, turn right, and return to Glencoe.

Introducing the multi-purpose vehicle that comes with either a German
or American badge -- and is built in Portugal
IT IS no surprise that Volkswagen has joined the ranks of
multi-purpose vehicle manufacturers with the Sharan, even if this is
actually a joint VW/Ford product, writes ROSS FINLAY.
While the Americans pioneered the current MPV approach, Volkswagen was
even earlier in the field with a people-carrier type of vehicle. In 1950
the Beetle was developed into the Microbus, with three banks of seats
and the now-long-abandoned rear engine location.
Volkswagen and Ford, competitors in the marketplace though they may
be, decided early on to hedge their bets by merging their plans for
rival MPVs. The result was the AutoEuropa joint venture company in
Portugal, operating in a very modern factory at Palmela south of Lisbon.
This has a three-shift capacity to turn out 180,000 vehicles per year,
suggesting that it may eventually branch out beyond MPVs.
Most of the new generation MPVs -- even if not all are differently
badged vehicles coming off the same production line -- look similar in
body styling and interior layout, although with detail differences which
each manufacturer hopes will attract customers to its own dealers'
showrooms.
The Sharan shares the familiar one-box appearance, aerodynamically
effective front-end silhouette and versatile seating patterns.
Its roomy interior is contained within an overall length marginally
bigger than that of the Passat saloon. Despite the longer wheelbase, the
turning circle remains reasonable. The high-set driving position, good
visibility, low enough noise levels and general ride/handling package
are all fine, although -- in a sentence I wish I had thought of myself
-- a colleague pointed out that, from a keen driver's point of view, all
the main elements are farther apart than you would find them in a
saloon.
Volkswagen people in the UK were stunned when their manufacturing
partners announced the prices for the Galaxy, which is, of course, the
same basic vehicle. By promptly diverting money from non-essential
activities, they managed to do what few other companies have achieved --
undercut Ford with their entry level price.
The Sharan is very price-competitive in areas like the turbo diesel
engine option and the provision of automatic transmission. With VW's own
115bhp two-litre petrol engine, the base model CL costs #15,899 in
manual transmission form, #1000 extra as an automatic.
The company's highly regarded direct injection turbo diesel joins the
range at #16,649, and is the first engine of its kind to be used in an
MPV. Pick of the power plants is the 2.8-litre VR6 engine, whose 174bhp
output gives the Sharan much better performance as well as easy motorway
cruising.  It is available in the GL at #21,267 and in the
comprehensively equipped Carat at #22,174.

THE Scottish Winter Safety Campaign, climaxing in a series of police
checks running from Monday to Friday of next week, is a much more
comprehensive affair than last year's Tyre Safety Week on whose
initiatives it is based.
Then, Scottish police forces made random checks on vehicle tyres, and
asked drivers if they were aware of the current tyre regulations. Half
the 20,000 drivers questioned did not know either the regulations or the
possible penalties involved.
We should all be aware that the minimum tread depth required by law is
1.6mm, that the maximum penalty for having tyres with less tread than
that is #2500, and that a bald tyre conviction may be worth three
penalty points.
The added element in next week's checks will be the attention paid to
vehicle lighting, and the police should make one point clear -- that it
is an offence to drive with foglights on when visibility is good enough
for them not to be necessary.
Being half-dazzled by these lights, when there is no need for them, is
an annoying feature of dusk, evening and even daylight driving.
Sometimes, of course, the drivers involved have just forgotten to switch
them off after a previous journey -- so maybe car-makers should provide
more prominent warning lights on their fascias.

If you are looking at the 'conventional' space-travel
market, suggests a close-focus on the new
Renault Laguna model that defies such a description
WHILE so much attention has been focused on 4x4s and MPVs, the other
part of the market for people who want something roomy but different
from a saloon -- that is, the estate car sector -- has been languishing.
However, just as there are 4x4 buyers who might be better served by an
MPV, and the other way round, many of us who simply want a bit more
versatile space in our cars would be just as well thinking about a
conventional estate.
In Europe as a whole, the estate car market has been romping ahead
during the last decade. Curious national differences show up in what the
industry calls the upper-medium segment. Spanish customers hardly exist
at all, the French are only vaguely interested, while German, Swiss and
Italian buyers grab estate cars in profusion. Here in the UK we are
somewhere in the middle.
One problem is that there have not been many new upper-medium designs
appearing in the showrooms. Renault is just launching its Laguna estate,
and this is a much more businesslike effort than the rather ordinary
Savanna, even though it retains the Laguna saloon's wheelbase, instead
of being extended, as the Savanna was over the 21 on which it was based.
Some estates are simply saloons with a chunk of extra metalwork tacked
on. The Laguna estate is far from being just that. In fact, I do not
remember any other type which has had so much extra detail design and
construction work lavished on it.
While the front end of the estate is the same as the saloon's, the
rear end, having the slightly ungainly side-on appearance which comes
with angled C-pillars, is genuinely purpose-built. Floor and body are
not just extended, but also substantially reinforced.
This is the first estate I have driven whose tailgate glass and rear
quarter windows are all fitted with demister wires. They can also be
specified with sunblinds.
Part of the reason for this is that, if you go for the #500 option of
the ''family pack'', the Laguna comes fitted, as a third row, with a
rear-facing children's seat, better designed than many of the type. At
the launch there were persistent questions about whether this is really
the best layout from a safety point of view, in the event of a rear-end
impact, and Renault people quoted plenty of accident statistics to say
that it is.
Having three banks of seats all occupied is not something which will
happen much of the time. A working estate has to be, first and foremost,
a good load carrier. The Laguna scores well here, not least because it
has the biggest load space in its class and, in certain models, the
highest payload. Sill height is lower than in most of its rivals, while
tie-down rings and a retaining net are available.
Renault's usual RN, RT and RXE specifications apply. Standard on the
RXE and optional on the RT, there is an arrangement by which the
tailgate window can be opened separately from the metal door itself.
Another unusual feature is the fact that the tailgate wiper is designed
to double as an exterior opening handle.
Many of us use these things for that purpose without their being
really up to the job. This one will reset itself to the correct parking
position if displaced by rough handling.
As with MPVs -- almost none of which answers this question
satisfactorily --what happens if all the seats are occupied, but you
still need to transport a pile of luggage? The Laguna estate copes with
this by having a neatly designed roof box, mounted on the standard roof
bars, as a #300 extra.
This has much the same carrying capacity as the Laguna saloon's
conventional boot, and there is also a very thoughtful touch in that the
occasional third row of seats can be detached and fitted into the roof
box. Altogether, the Laguna estate has had a fair amount of positive
thinking applied to its design.
Another option, which is worthwhile on any estate likely to be heavily
laden at times, is self-levelling suspension. Renault offers this at an
extra #395.
On the road, the estate drives very much like a heavier version of the
saloon. Ride is supple, and the handling qualities seem very similar to
the saloon's. Power-assisted steering is standard. One snag is the way
the fascia reflects distractingly, in certain light conditions, on the
inside of the screen. And Renault has been deluded into fitting one of
those so-called ''safety'' double-curvature driver-door mirrors which,
in my experience, conceal an overtaking car rather than make its
position obvious.
There are four engine types available: a 95bhp 1.8-litre which is
barely powerful enough to pull a well-laden estate briskly around; a
115bhp two-litre, a 140bhp two-litre 16-valve; and the 85bhp multivalve
diesel unit familiar from the Laguna saloon, which benefits in
performance from being, not a two-litre like most of its direct rivals,
but a 2.2.
Prices are keen. They start at #12,390 for the 1.8-litre RN; a
mid-range example is the two-litre RT at #14,210; while the two-litre
16-valve RXE costs #16,880.

Most folk who have heard Blackanized have requested more. David
Belcher tells why
Iwas recently fully Blackanized. It was a happy and organic process.
Initially, I journeyed eastwards unto Edinburgh, and then strolled
further eastwards to meet a number of the city's wiser men. Entering a
tenement flat off Leith Walk, I squashed myself into a tiny living-room
alive with the paraphernalia of music-making: a vast mixing-board,
industrial-strength speakers, stacks of records, sundry instruments, an
armchair piled with cassette tapes, ashtrays.
Recumbent musos occupied an assortment of chairs, fidgeting
listlessly, keen to get back to recording. A pair of camouflage trousers
lay where they had been discarded over the back of a settee. Having no
need of disguise, the Blackanized collective were at home in their 6T4K
Studio.
Blackanized are an emergent combo centred on the DJ'ing partnership of
Joseph Malik and Calvin Nuttal. An exiled Glaswegian, Mr Malik is
unfeasibly long and lean, a spinner of engaging tales. The nomadic
Calvin (Bristol, Wolverhampton, Leeds) is possessed of a laugh of
conspiratorial wheeziness. Absent was Steve Christie, late of the Chimes
and Botany 5, Blackanized's keyboard maestro, arranger, and producer.
Unkle Jack sat at the mixing-desk. Wiry and full-bearded, Unkle Jack
is Blackanized's recording engineer and live sound man. If there is a
motorcycle gang called Satan's Spectors, Unkle Jack is its president.
Are there complaints about sound levels from the other tenement
residents, I inquire idly as an ice-breaker.
''No,'' says Joseph with mock-solemnity, checking me out. ''We have to
tell the neighbours to turn the noise down.''
Most folk who've heard Blackanized have requested more. In their
two-year lifespan, they've crafted a superfine EP via the BMG label
featuring E-burgh jazz-funkers Freshly Squeezed, Music For Your Mind.
More recently there was a flawed but encouraging single, Ain't No New
Thing.
An early demo, Miles Out Of Time, was sent to the hipper-than-thou Mo'
Wax label, Joseph and Calvin having met DJ-turned-label supremo James
Lavelle before he had the idea to form Mo' Wax. ''It was lost for six
months before suddenly coming out on the Headz compilation album as a
track credited to MF Productions. We haven't got any royalties. We are
pissed off. We have declared war on James Lavelle.''
Blackanized draw their inspiration from their roots in hip hop, rap,
funk, jazz, reggae, Motown, soul, Stevie Wonder. Their name reflects
this heritage, being a song by r&amp;b original Hank Ballard: ''You got to
get yourself blackanized to get yourself organised.''
Joseph and Calvin are thus an organisational force behind the East
Coast Project. What's the East Coast project? 1.) Edinburgh musicians
gaining strength through unity. 2.) A compilation album, released on the
Stereo MCs' Natural Response label, highlighting the loops and grooves
created by Freshly Squeezed, Coco and the Bean, the aforementioned Steve
Christie and his Experience, Suga Bullitt, 3 Bag Brew, and the
Outa'Nationals. 3.) Proof that whereas many Glasgow bands tend to think
in terms of doing musicbiz deals, Edinburgh bands just get on with
dooby-doo'ing music.
Blackanized don't have much time for the Big G. Words of praise for
anything coming out of Glasgow other than the train to Edinburgh? ''DJ
Krash Slaughta
.
.
. he's good. He's just signed to Virgin's XL offshoot.''
Malik has been in Edinburgh for the past three years, having had to
quit his reggae DJ berth at Babylon fairly suddenly. He alludes
melodramatically to ''bad dealings that got heavy
.
.
. I can't go into Glasgow, it's no joke, I'd get shot. I sneaked back
for a gig about a year and half ago. But I can't anymore.''
However, to Joseph it's more a life-and-death matter that ''music
doesn't get to breathe in Glasgow. It's all rock, techno, and house.
There's only one good club, Blueprint at Volcano on Wednesdays, DJ'd by
NT, good guys
.
.
. they have a skateboard ramp and breakdancers, and while they're
playing hip hop, you can be playing table tennis.''
''Ping. Pong,'' Unkle Jack chuckles softly, with an air of gnomic
menace.
Ah yes, they do things unpleasantly in Glasgow. Joseph knows.
''Glasgow is commercial, hard, nasty, violent,'' he says. ''It's centred
around money more than artistic things. I've danced to rave, house,
techno
.
.
. and eventually I thought 'I can't handle this anymore.' It's boring,
drug-motivated
.
.
. the whole Glasgow dance scene is just about ecstasy. And ecstasy
does something chemically to people's brain-patterns where all they want
is endless rhythmic repetition, total monotony.
''When we DJ in Edinburgh, we play hip hop, jazz, soul, reggae
.
.
. and you see people doing different dances to the different styles of
music. With house, it's one dance all night long. As DJs, ours is a
natural vibe that you don't have to get out of your head to enjoy.
''I remember I used to go to the original Slam nights in Tin Pan Alley
when Slam played northern soul and hip hop
.
.
. and then acid came in around 1988, and you saw the lightbulbs go on
above people's heads: 'Ah, we can make tons of money playing this!'
''And I know certain people in Glasgow will be reading this and
thinking: 'How can he say that?' Because from the age of 16 I was around
Glasgow clubs, making my mistakes in public
.
.
. but I can say now that I've grown up and I know better.
''The sad thing now is that some Edinburgh clubs would rather ram the
place out with some house DJ from England
.
.
. but then they won't make any money at the bar. With us, they will
make money at the bar. Our punters smoke a bit of hash and have a drink.
Some clubs can't handle our punters -- 'Man, there's crowds of people
all skinning up!'
''But we say: 'Better that than Hanger 13 and kids getting carried
outside dead'.''
In their current incarnation, the Blackanized duo have been earning
plenty of positive media attention. That makes a change from Calvin's
one previous appearance in the papers, in a Sun story headlined Rapper
Jumps In Train Window, written following an unfortunate altercation with
British Rail police on the platform of York station.
Blackanized recently converted Blues And Soul, the long-established
black music magazine. ''A journalist complained about our name: 'How can
they call themselves Blackanized when they're as light-skinned as they
are?' We sent her a tape. Once she'd listened, she took it all back.''
Blackanized's forthcoming album will enlist the services of Marco
Nelson, late of the Young Disciples, and Jackie Jackson, of Smith and
Mighty ''an old-school soulie who can still rock the party''.
What will it be like, Joseph?
''Beats and basslines but with real players
.
.
. we want to be making jazz for the streets, for hip hop kids. We
don't like to get bored. We like to get as many different flavours as we
can.
''I want to look back when I'm 70 and see I made music with life in
it.''
Long live the life-enhancing Blackanized, indeed.

IRWIN Winkler, producer and director of the thriller, The Net, out
this week, is a legendary Hollywood figure. His films as producer, with
Martin Scorsese directing and starring Robert De Niro, were New York,
New York, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas. With John Boorman directing, he
produced the thriller Point Blank, starring Lee Marvin, and the fantasy
Leo the Last, starring Marcello Mastroianni.
Think of an award-winning film of the past couple of decades and it is
probably a Winkler production -- They Shoot Horses Don't They, Round
Midnight, one of the best-ever films about jazz musicians, Music Box
directed by Costa Gavras starring Jessica Lange, the thriller about Nazi
war criminals who have escaped punishment, and The Right Stuff, the best
film about space exploration so far, were all his productions.
He started directing late in his career with Guilty by Suspicion
(which he also wrote) made in 1989 about a black-listed Hollywood
director, played by De Niro, during the McCarthy era. He followed that
with Night and the City, also with De Niro, based on the 1950s Jules
Dassin film noir starring Richard Widmark. Winkler and De Niro have
worked together seven times.
In The Net, a thriller about a woman who discovers she does not exist
according to the computers which handle her daily life, he tackles the
dangers which computers present to society.
''I think it is a two-fisted problem because computer technology has
done wonders for our lives in medicine, in science, and everyday life,''
Winkler said. ''It has opened up new fields. But I also feel they have
taken control of our lives to a very large extent. Hal, the computer in
Stanley Kubrick's 2001 seems to be in our lives. We are being ruled by
them and we are losing control of the technology.''
The computer programs used in the film were realistic, he said. They
were developed with the advice of the Macintosh people and the company
appeared delighted with the result, not at all worried about the film's
message.
''It might seem futuristic, but we did consult the experts and after
they saw it they sent me a very nice CD-Rom as a gift,'' he said. ''We
shot the climax at a real computer convention in San Francisco and they
allowed us to build our own booth and install our own software. It must
have been convincing because people tried to buy it, which proves people
will buy anything.''
He denied there was anything sinister in the choice of an English
actor, Jeremy Northam, to play the villain. It was not part of a
Hollywood plot, and what about those Scottish films with English
villains? We agreed, however, not to talk about Rob Roy or Braveheart.
''The reason, apart from the fact he is a very good actor, who both
looks good and reminds me of James Mason or the young Olivier when he
played heavy roles, was that I wanted to give a sense that the whole
computer conspiracy was not just confined to Silicon Valley and southern
California or was shaped by America, but was international,'' he said.
''By having an Englishman we would convey that.''
The film is the first that the rapidly rising Sandra Bullock has had
to carry on her own, and Winkler said he had cast her because he wanted
an actress the audience would be comfortable with in the opening scenes
when she was confined to working with her computer.
''She was very smart and after we had talked I had a kind of emotional
reaction -- I thought I would not mind spending a couple of hours in a
dark movie theatre with that girl. It is the same reaction I had when I
first saw De Niro and Stallone.''
It is to Winkler that Stallone owes his career, because it was he and
his associate Robert Chartoff who mortgaged their homes to put up the
money to produce Rocky when no studio would touch it. The film won the
1976 best picture Oscar and led to a whole series, all Winkler
productions.
I said I had just seen the latest Stallone film, Assassins, at its
very first screening, which was in London, and he said he was seeing the
picture the next day in Los Angeles. He had a suspicion it was a remake
of one of his own productions, The Mechanic, a Michael Winner film which
starred Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent about an ageing killer
and a young man trying to take over his job, and therefore he might not
like Assassins.
''I suspect they have stolen my movie, but nowadays they call that a
homage,'' he said.
He is currently editing a thriller, The Juror, starring Alec Baldwin
as a killer every bit as scary as Hannibal Lecter, which, since it is
written by Ted Tally who wrote the script for Silence of the Lambs, is
not surprising. It is due for release towards the end of the year. After
that he will work again with Scorsese on Mine, a biographical drama
about George and Ira Gershwin.
For the moment he has no more plans to direct. ''I am not in any
hurry,'' he said. ''That is what I tell my wife because otherwise she
will throw me out of the house. Directing becomes very personal, it
takes your life over. Now is the time to enjoy the fruits of the success
of The Net, which has been a big hit here in the States and in
Australia. It gets lots of people into movie theatres, which is nice.''
One could, of course, pretty well say that about every Winkler film.

Minister warns hill farmers of tough round of public spending
negotiations.
THE struggle to sustain the value of HLCAs is going to be a hard one,
according to Lord Lindsay, the Scottish Office Agriculture Minister.
Speaking yesterday, during a brief visit to the Blackface ram sales in
Newton Stewart, Lord Lindsay said: ''I give this warning, there will be
a tough round of public spending negotiations this autumn, but I will be
arguing in London stronger than ever for the case for HLCAs.''
The Minister also pointed out that apart from the #40m which is paid
directly as subsidies to hill farmers an additional #160m goes to the
hills and uplands through other schemes and initiatives. He added: ''Ten
years ago only #70m was going into the hills. I would not be too
depressed about HLCAs, after all I'm not the only minister in Government
with farming experience.''
Lord Lindsay, who has travelled widely throughout Scotland since his
appointment during the summer, commented that in general terms farmers
appeared to be happy. He said: ''I have found most to be optimistic.
Money is being earned by farmers across the board and incomes are going
up.
''But I'm always conscious that some are doing better than others.
High feed prices, for example, present difficulties for pig and poultry
producers. I cannot conceive of everyone being happy at the same time.''
The Minister also emphasised the part agriculture plays in the
Scottish economy, saying: ''I want the wider community to recognise the
importance of Scottish farming to the countryside and the environment.
There are 60,000 people directly involved in the industry but when the
processing sector is included the total comes close to 200,000.''
Responding to a query of how taxpayers might react if they realised
just how much public money is going into farming, Lord Lindsay said:
''Yes, the taxpayer is putting money into agriculture, but so too is the
farmer. The taxpayer often forgets how farming fortunes can change with
drought and flooding for example.''
Among the many farmers who spoke to Lord Lindsay yesterday was John
Scott, the convener of the NFU's hill farming committee. He said: ''I
stressed to the Minister the huge problems in the West Highlands where
costs are rising and lamb numbers are down.
''I believe that the specialist sheep farm in that area is seriously
at risk. Differential payments need to be maintained.''
Lord Lindsay also announced that he has launched a new initiative to
cut down on the amount of paperwork farmers have to battle with. He
said: ''I am well aware of the seemingly endless flow of official
paperwork which burdens our farmers. While much of this is necessary to
protect human and animal health, and to safeguard taxpayers' money, I am
confident that there is scope for making cuts.
''The taskforce I have set up is to review the need for existing forms
and other types of paperwork and to report to me on ways in which this
can be reduced.''

A NEW record price of #38,000 for a ram lamb was the highlight of the
second day of the annual sale of Blackface rams in Newton Stewart
yesterday.
Selling the lamb were Charlie and Jim Mitchell, Cairnzean, Newton
Stewart, while the successful bidder was Graham McClymont, Cuil, Newton
Stewart.
Earlier in the day Mr McClymont, selling from his Clanary flock, saw
his best go at #11,000 to Drannandow Farms, Newton Stewart, and Ian
Bond, Glen, Gatehouse, with another fetching #7500 to New Luce breeders
Tom McMiking, Miltonise, and Willie Ferguson, Markdhu.
Robert Weir, Townfoot, Thornhill, had a peak of #10,000 for one which
sold to JW Kay &amp; Co, Gass, Straiton, but this was bettered by their
near-neighbour Andrew Paton of Craig, who sold first at #17,000 in a
joint deal to James Sharp, Longcroft, Lauder, and Andrew Hamilton,
Glenmanna, Thornhill, and then at #10,000 to Jim McWhirter, Grimmet,
Dalmellington, and David Kay, Burncastle, Lauder.
However, there were more fireworks in store with John Ramsay,
Barhaskine, Glenluce, selling at #12,000 to Ian McWhirter, Linfairn,
Straiton.
The partnership of Blackwood and Anderson, Greenside, Muirkirk, sold
at #7500 to Charlie and Jim Mitchell and also at #6000 to Andrew Paton.
Then Jim Blackwood, Nether Wellwood, Muirkirk, put the seal on a
highly-successful sale selling at #26,000 to Willie Dunlop, Elmscleugh,
Dunbar, Angus Kennedy, Mitchellhill, Biggar, and Ewan McMillan, Traquair
Hill, Innerleithen.
Overall 277 ram lambs averaged #1062.05, up #9.82. The auctioneer was
James Craig.

IVORY &amp; Sime Trustlink's TrustWorthy Mortgage Plan offers
all-embracing cover for almost everything. You don't have to take all
the options on offer but they are available if you want them. Described
as an innovative PEP mortgage package built around investment trusts, it
has a ''menu'' of protection benefits which address the needs created by
government cuts in state benefits for sickness and unemployment.
With such a product there are bound to be some complexities but
basically, under the plan, borrowers may opt for interest and investment
protection cover which will meet their mortgage commitments if they
become unable to do their own job. The Government's new 'incapacity'
benefit, which has replaced invalidity benefit, is now much more
restricted than hitherto. It will be paid only if the person is unfit
for any type of work.
TrustWorthy also offers full protection, even for the self-employed,
against unemployment, for which state assistance has been cut from
October 1. This option can meet mortgage interest payments, normal
monthly investments into the plan and associated buildings contents
insurance premiums. Cover is offered effectively from the start.
Payments begin after one month but are then backdated to the first day
of unemployment. The customer chooses what cover to take.
The plan avoids the problem, says Ivory &amp; Sime, of standard mortgage
protection plans which combine accident, sickness, and unemployment
insurance so that borrowers who already have one type of cover end up
paying for it again. Each benefit under Trustworthy is separate.
In conjunction with the launch of Ivory &amp; Sime's Trustworthy Mortgage
Plan, two mortgage products have been introduced. These are financed by
the Scottish Building Society in Scotland and Lambeth Building Society
in England and Wales. The PEP-linked mortgage has a cashback of up to
#9000 and unemployment cover for up to 12 months provided free.
When the cashback is invested in the Ivory &amp; Sime TrustWorthy Mortgage
Plan this will either help to reduce the mortgage term or reduce the
regular contribution required.
The minimum loan, though is #75,000 and the maximum normally #150,000.
There is a minimum mortgage term of five years and a maximum of 35
years. As with all investment or mortgage products the costs and fees
should be carefully examined.

ACTION Clad, a small manufacturer of outdoor clothing, based at
Cowdenbeath in Fife, has called in the receivers.
Accountancy firm KPMG has reduced the workforce from 60 to 25 since it
took over on September 9, but the company continues to trade while a
buyer is sought.
Corporate recovery partner Blair Nimmo said there were claims of about
#100,000 against Action Clad. Its problems stemmed from a period of
unprofitable trading when it moved into the leisure market, but it had a
good customer base and order book, Nimmo added. Action Clad makes
waterproofs, fleeces and other outdoor clothing.

<TEXT>
NORTHERN Venture Trust, which will mainly invest in small companies in
Scotland and the North of England, has received commitments of more than
#10m from individual investors in its first stage of placing.
This comfortably exceeds the #6m minimum which the new venture capital
trust (VCT) needed to go ahead.
Michael Denny, executive chairman of Newcastle-based Northern Venture
Managers, said about 600 individuals had put in between #2000 and
#100,000.
There will be a public offer of shares in the trust, which will be
capped at #20m. The offer closes on October 24.
Mr Denny said he hoped the VCT would attract around #15m in all so
that it has a similar capitalisation to the existing Northern Investors
Company investment trust.
The plan is that its portfolio of investments it will closely mirror
that of Northern Investors, which was founded in 1984.
Whereas investment trusts are aimed at institutional as well as
individual investors, VCT's are a new form of investment vehicle aimed
solely at individuals. There is a 20% tax credit on all funds invested
and capital gains tax liability can be deferred.
VCTs, unlike the small companies they invest in, will be quoted on the
Stock Exchange.

A FORMER bus conductor whose earnings are just a couple of short fares
off #1.5m . . . a tyre and exhaust entrepreneur whose income accelerated
by 35% . . . a newsagent who delivered another #900,000 to the bank . .
. and a milkman whose earnings were a couple of pints short of #900,000
pounds.
These are just four of Scotland's top business earners last year. And
the analysis of earnings -- made up of salary and dividend payments --
shows that no-one in the top 25 earned less than a #250,000.
The business leaders who occupy the top ten placings in the league
table, compiled by Scottish Business Insider magazine, were virtually
unchanged from last year.
''It just proves that the wealthy can only get wealthier,'' said one
envious corporate financier salivating over the worth of the many people
he does business with.
The top slot is occupied by Brian Souter who along with his sister,
Ann Gloag, has made spectacular dividend killings from the flotation of
their bus company Stagecoach.
The pair were each paid a salary of less than #100,000 for heading up
Britain's biggest bus firm, but for the second year in a row both
received over #1m in dividend payments from shares in the company.
Mr Souter, who is chairman, earned a total of #1.46m last year --
that's more than #28,000 a week!. Assuming he works on average 70 hours
a week, he currently rings up #400 per hour.
Anne Gloag's earnings put her in third place with a total of #1.22m.
''She has been able to comfortably pay for her recent purchase of
Beaufort Castle, and its contents out of her dividends over the past two
years,'' said Chris Baur, editorial director of Scottish Business
Insider.
Tom Farmer showed you can't get better than a Kwik-Fit salary. He is
now the highest paid, in salary terms, pulling in #737,000 a year. He
says he works seven days a week on his business, but the compensation is
that he earns over #2000 every day.
And then there is the additional #609,000 in dividend payments just to
keep the household budget ticking over.
Other big earners in the dividend stakes were John Menzies, whose
family retail newspaper and distribution business earned him over
#700,000 on top of his salary which fell just short of #200,000.
Arnold Clark, the self-made motor dealer received the biggest rise,
144%, on the year before. He took a 40% cut when things were tough in
1993, dropping his salary to a paltry #275,000 but made up for it last
year with an increase to over #670,000.
Fraser Morrison, the boss of building firm Morrison Construction, took
home the second-biggest rise in earnings, up 112% to over #700,000.
Analyst say he is one to watch in the year ahead as his earnings are
set to soar following his company's successful flotation earlier this
month.
The biggest drop in earnings, about 40%, were experienced by brothers
Alan and Robert Wiseman who run the rapdily expanding, Wiseman Dairies.
But there's no need to feel too sorry for them. Alan still brought in
#891,000, while Robert earned #774,000.
Chris Baur said: ''It is disappointing there are no spectacular
newcomers to the league table. This emphasises the fact that Scotland
needs to produce a new breed of entrepreneurs.''

Chicago, Thursday -- Large retailers reported modest sales gains for
September as business picked up at some clothing stores with the help of
cooler weather and markdowns.
But the pace of sales growth was weaker than last year at many
retailers, and shoppers were not expected to spend lavishly as the
crucial holiday season approaches.
''The economy and economic indicators look good, but the consumer
isn't buying,'' said Peter Schaeffer of Dillon Read &amp; Co. ''I think
Christmas is going to be tough.''
A Salomon Brothers' index of same-store sales, or sales among stores
open at least a year, rose 3.3% in September, down from a 3.9% gain a
year ago.

STRONG sales in the Mothercare chain helped Storehouse overcome weaker
summer trading at its BhS shops, the group announced yesterday.
Overall sales in the first half of the year were between 1% and 2%
better than in the corresponding period in 1994, it said.
Chief executive Keith Edelman said BhS sales had been affected by the
unusually hot weather in July and August, but Mothercare traded
strongly.
Sales in the second half would be helped by the opening of six new Bhs
stores in time for the Christmas season, together with the completion of
extensions to a number of major city centre stores and the continuing
roll-out of the new concept Mothercare outlets.
Storehouse also said that interim profits would be ''significantly
ahead'' of last year, helped by higher cash balances and a surplus of
#1m from the sale of the One Up chain.

A TEST which detects the risk of a heart attack was one of the
inventions recognised at the 1995 John Logie Baird Awards for Innovation
in Edinburgh's International Conference Centre yesterday.
The #60,000 award contest is intended to encourage the development of
Scottish ideas and inventions in Scotland, rather than overseas.
This year's contest attracted a record 250 entrants, the highest in
its eight year history.
Tayside firm, Shield Diagnostics, developers of the Shield Activated
Factor XII test, which assesses the status of an individual's blood
clotting system and their risk of heart attacks and strokes. came top of
the Best New Innovative Idea category.
Dr Peter Foster, one of the research team said: ''The test measures
the activated level of a particular clotting factor which provides the
link between high fat levels and the stimulation of blood clotting.
''Early indications suggest that our test may provide a more accurate
indication of risk of heart attack than any previous tests.''
The lifesaving test, which cost #500,000 to develop, is still
undergoing stringent clinical trials, but the company hopes to put it on
the market next year.
Mike Rowan, won the Most Innovative Project by an Individual award,
with a set of light plastic-moulded stilts suitable for children aged
nine and upwards and adults.
The stilts, which provide an adjustable foot support over the centre
of gravity, took five years and 20 prototypes to develop, are already on
the market through the Index catalogue shops and Empire catalogues, at
#29.99 a pair.
The inspiration for the development, which Mr Rowan hopes will become
the latest new craze, came when he entertained children at stilts
workshops in Australia.
''I found the existing design of stilts was poor and set about
redesigning a new lightweight style, which was easier for children to
use,'' he said.
He collected the award with his nine-year-old daughter, Kirsty, who
helped to test the stilts.
Midlothian-based Memory Corporation -- which has grown to a $500m
business in just over two years, thanks to its specialist knowledge of
the computer memory market -- won the Most Innovative Product by a
Company award, for a micro-processor which overcomes the 40% Defective
Dynamic Random Access Memories (D-RAMS) in all computers.
Each winner received #2000 in cash and a further #3500 in consultancy
from co-sponsors, Touche Ross.

THE people of Merseyside and North Wales must wonder what has hit
them.
ScottishPower's corporate circus is in town. Lorries carrying
advertising hoardings declaring the closing date for acceptance of its
#1100m hostile bid for their local electricity company bear an eerie
similarity to men carrying sandwich boards which declare that the end of
the world is nigh.
It looks as though the end of Manweb's life as an independent company
is nigh but it has not gone down without a fight.
ScottishPower appears to have cut it fine with its offer -- with none
of Manweb's institutional investors overjoyed by its generosity.
The Glasgow-based utility must be wondering whether today's result
will be a much closer call than the foregone conclusion some had
expected.
Why else would ScottishPower be spending #300,000 on prime-time
television slots on HTV and Granada in its effort to spread the word to
Manweb's 114,000 private shareholders.
Manweb, which continued to put on a brave face yesterday, was keen to
hammer home the scale of the ScottishPower invasion, pointing out that
its predator had bought expensive slots in the middle of Coronation
Street.
The two electricity companies have been the stars of their own soap
opera during recent weeks, with claims and counter-claims firing back
and forth.
It will be interesting to see what transpires after the final credits
roll at 1pm.
ScottishPower is likely to have won, even though Manweb's biggest
institutional shareholder, Prudential, is backing the Chester-based
company's management.
If Manweb has been beaten, the two sides will then be in the somewhat
awkward position of sitting around a table to talk, not argue.
However, the end of the 60-day offer period will be something of a
relief for the two armies of public relations ''spin doctors'', merchant
bankers and solicitors, who will be able to reschedule cancelled
holidays.

ANOTHER fine old British company seems set to pass into foreign
ownership. The #1800m bid from the Franco-US company Rhone-Poulenc Rorer
for Fisons is almost certain to be successful. But there should not be
too much in the way of sentimental weeping.
Certainly the volume of institutional sales yesterday when turnover
amounted to 212.5 million shares spoke volumes as to how disenchanted
the investment community had become over Fisons' long-term record and
doubts over its prospects.
RPR now claims it owns a 16.6% stake.
Fisons' record has been little short of a shambles and includes a
dividend cut, the departure of two chief executives and three profit
warnings since 1991.
Certainly the latest chief executive to hold the hot seat, Stuart
Wallis, has done a great deal to realign the company and has taken harsh
and unsentimental decisions.
Some of these decisions raised a few eyebrows such as selling of the
research and development activities for #202m in March and then last
month entering into joint venture agreements with Ciba and US
biotechnology group Magainin to develop a new generation of asthma drugs
and a lung anti-biotic respectively.
While Fisons is bringing its highly regarded drug delivery systems to
its partners, the tangible benefits through cash flow will not be seen
until the next decade.
The pharmaceutical industry has been talking for some time about the
advantages of joint research but so far little has been done in
practical terms -- perhaps the fear of creating a camel rather than a
thoroughbred horse has been a factor.
Meantime, on the table is a pile of RPR cash which is certain to
attract shareholders to a much greater degree than hopes for the future.
RPR has played a good game of bluff with its offer still perhaps a
touch on the mean side with an exit p/e of just over 15 which does not
represent that significant a premium for control. But cash remaining
locked up by retaining Fisons shares is effectively dead money.

TURMOIL continues at Allied-Domecq with about 500 employees yesterday
being told that they are getting their marching orders.
The redundancies are all in the Carlsberg-Tetley brewery division
where morale has been hard hit both because of poor trading in
comparison with the rest of the national brewers and Allied's welcome
frankness that brewing is no longer a core activity wth no more money to
be spent on it.
The reorganisation will cost #50m which is a nasty knock for a company
already with gearing of more than 70% and poor cash generation.
Allied's problems appear deep seated and at the highest echelons of
the boardroom.
The City was shocked when David Jarvis was sacked as head of the
spirits division particularly as this is the only division doing at all
reasonably well -- it is said that he was sceptical about the purchase
of Domecq.
Almost as soon as the cheque was paid over ran into trouble because of
the collapse of the Mexican peso. Although the damage was more apparent
than real for the overall group, it did alter the City's perception
adversely to the extent that it has contributed to the shares
underperforming its peer group by 12.6% in the past year and overall
consumer shares by 31.9%.
There was concern yesterday that because of the currently depressed
cash flow, the dividend total may have to be cut.
The pub estate has low margins -- just over half those seen at both
Bass and Whtbread -- and in a sector where the majors are having to
fight off the increasing competition from the innovative pub companies
such as Wetherspoon.
That may justify criticism that Allied has failed to set the pace at
any time over the years and only now is shaking up management.
A much more decisive vision is required or else there will be a return
of the takeover rumours as in its present form, it is an ideal break-up.
Michael Jackaman may retire as chairman next year with deputy chairman
Sir Christopher Hogg of Reuters the favourite to succeed him. But time
is not an Allied's side and other new blood is urgently required.

BREWING
MORE than 500 jobs are to be axed by brewer Carlsberg-Tetley, the
company announced yesterday.
Under cost-cutting and reorganisation plans, it plans to close its
brewing and packaging business at Warrington in Cheshire with the loss
of 240 jobs. while another 150 jobs will go at the brewery in Burton on
Trent, Staffordshire.
Streamlining of marketing and distribution will see around another 115
lose their jobs, the brewing group owned by Allied Domecq and Carlsberg
said.
Carlsberg-Tetley said the Warrington brewery would be closed by
October 1996. The 150 jobs at the Burton brewery would be lost by 1998.
Meanwhile, 115 ''head-office-type'' jobs would be lost mainly in the
Midlands with a sprinkling around the rest of the country, spokesman
Iain Oag said.
The cuts are set to cost about #50m in exceptional charges for Allied
Domecq this year, he said. ''The beer market has not been growing
strongly. Though the business has been profitable, the cuts are needed
to provide the right basis for competitive success in a difficult
marketplace''.
Although the Warrington brewery, the group's fourth biggest, would
close, the 250 distribution jobs at the site would be safe, Mr Oag said.
The Burton brewery is Carlsberg-Tetley's biggest in the UK with a
workforce of around 600 and it will remain open, he added.
SHARES of the Boddington pubs, hotels and nursing homes group soared
92p at one time yesterday afternoon after it said that it had received
an approach which could lead to a bid ''at substantially in excess of
the current share price''.
The disclosure was forced out of the Manchester-based company after
not only growing speculation that a bid was on the way but that the
buying seemed to be ''inspired'' with three million shares traded on
Tuesday with much of the action coming from the Manchester and Liverpool
areas.
That volume is 10 times the normal average daily trade.
The shares closed 86p higher at 358p on volume of 2.47 million.
The immediate conclusion was that the bidder could be Whitbread which
over the years has had associations with Boddington. Its shares eased 7p
to 633[1/2]p.
Boddington's half-time profits announced last month were effectively
static at #13m with beer sales down through the 454-pub estate.

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a classic novel in want of
serialisation needs only court the BBC to find favour with the masses.
But what is it we all crave when we tune in? Carol Clewlow investigates.
THERE'S been Middlemarch, Martin Chuzzlewit, and The Buccaneers. Now
there's Pride and Prejudice. No doubt about it, the classic serial has
hit a revival.
They've all been on BBC of course. The words BBC and classical serial
are synonymous. They go together, well, like Darcy and Elizabeth.
''Of course the BBC does these things so much better,'' we moan, a
perversion of the truth actually. For the heart of the matter is simply
that the BBC does them, the commercial companies in the main do not.
There are two reasons for this, the pair of them deeply entwined and
worth serious consideration, particularly by anyone currently hooked on
Pride and Prejudice who likes to trumpet at the same time the doctrine
of unrestrained market forces.
The first is cost. The bill for a classic serial like Pride and
Prejudice runs at around #1m an episode, twice that of contemporary
drama.
The second is viewership. It may feel in the office on Monday morning
as though the whole world is ablaze over the pros and cons of Darcy's
bathtime shots but this, like the supposed national furore over Martin
Amis' advances, is a delusion of the chattering classes.
For while it is true that the first episode of Pride and Prejudice
pulled in a highly commendable 9.5 million viewers, the facts of the
case are that most of the country by far preferred to flip over to ITV.
Independent companies rely on advertising. Their rates hinge on
viewership figures, and Ms Austen, semi-nude shots notwithstanding, can
still not generate the 14 million or so viewers which London's Burning
does at the same time on the other side.
Still 9.5 million is commendable. In truth it's more than that. It's
an astonishing figure which shows yet again the extraordinary pulling
power of the classic serial.
Just why this should be so is clearly a question Angeline Burton has
been asked a lot lately.
''The classical serial has everything,'' says the head of the BBC's
drama series publicity department firmly. In evidence she reels off the
list . . . ''history . . . romance . . . and of course the huge visual
attraction.''
It's true. A classic serial, for instance, is living history, for
there's never been a time machine like television. Television is the
time machine of which H G Wells dreamt.
It's better than the cinema. You sink back into your favourite chair
and take the trip just like the Time Traveller did, in the privacy of
your own home, and from there you're transported back 200 years.
And while it may be an air-brushed history, while the pedants may
gripe about the lack of authentic grubbiness or the occasional
over-application of mascara, still for the rest of us, as a trip, it's
not half bad. And anyway let's face it, it's as near as we're going to
get to that peculiarly twentieth-century ambition to see what life was
like for a previous generation.
Then, as Ms Burton points out, there's romance, buckets of it in a
classic serial.
And while devotees of Middlemarch, for instance, may argue that really
it's not that simple; that George Eliot makes it clear between every
line of the book that Dorothea really should have married the doctor
Lydgate not the artist Ladislaw as per the ''happy'' ending, still for
those with romance in their hearts, 'tis enough, 'twill serve . . .
Just how strong is this late twentieth-century upsurge of a yearning
for romance can be seen by the huge success of films like Pretty Woman
and Sleepless in Seattle. These films, as the critics have pointed out,
are attempts to re-create the great Hollywood romantic comedy, the genre
on which, as much as anything else, the industry reached its zenith.
But that was back in the thirties and romance is a more awkward
concept now, much less easy to place centre stage as Jane Austen was
able to do, much less simple to acknowledge as a raison d'etre. Put it
down to the Pill and/or feminism or what you will, but things seem much
less straightforward in that direction now.
Ghostbuster director Ivan Reitman talking about the problems of making
romantic films said the difficulty reflected ''the problems people are
having in real life''.
In an Aids world, even meeting someone had become a problem, he said,
let alone forming a relationship. ''There's a whole industry of
video-dating and phone services and personal ads that has sprung up in
our society because the old ways don't work any more, or don't work for
many people.''
He's right of course. There's been a sea-change in the social habits
of the single. Who would have taken bets 10 years ago, for example, on
that bastion of serious left wing thought, the Guardian, introducing
personal ad pages?
And while of course it's true that Mrs Bennet remains as inextricably
silly as Jane Austen intended, still has anyone noticed how among
sophisticated women of a certain age with body clocks ticking away, such
a parental devotion to finding partners for daughters somehow seems
rather less reprehensible?
The other attraction of the classic serial, as Angeline Burton points
out, are the costumes, sets, and glorious locations.
We're a leisured world now, against our will or by design and
television reflects it, and furthermore we're a dedicated car society.
Every season, it seems, there's another new series about houses and
gardens suggesting places to go on that Sunday drive. And nothing offers
houses and gardens in abundance like the classic serial.
Who can think of Castle Howard today without thinking also of
Brideshead Revisited? And how many small business advisers in the
Wiltshire shires are currently being tortured with schemes for Darcy's
Place wine-bars or Elizabeth Bennet tea-shops designed to tempt visitors
drawn there by television's Pride and Prejudice locations?
What this all adds up to, of course, is nostalgia, a prickly concept
it's true, but with a certain thought-provoking element to commend it.
''Perhaps,'' offers Angeline Burton, ''people are growing tired of
police and medical dramas.''
Perhaps they are. Perhaps more specifically they are growing tired of
the conditionality of the plots, their provisional nature, and by
implication the transient nature of the life which they so successfully
mirror.
Brecht said that in the disconnectedness of Shakespeare's scenes could
be seen the essential disconnectedness of human life. And if so then,
how much more so now?
The dramatic success of a series like ER or Casualty depends on this
very disconnectedness, the passing through of human life, albeit caught
on film by a permanent cast; snapshots captured at the ultimate moment
of triumph or more likely tragedy, where neither what went before nor
what comes after is known or needs to be known. The short story in
essence. The precise opposite of what is provided by the classic serial.
At the beginning of Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen tells us that
''the family of Dashwood had been long settled in Sussex''. On the first
page of Persuasion Sir Walter Elliot takes up his family history, the
only book he cares to read.
The writers of the books turned into classic serials present us with a
society which is the very opposite of transient, one whose very reason
for being is its permanence and its utter connectedness.
They do not rush us in on a stretcher with their characters, for us to
live out their lives with them in high drama for the 50 minutes
allotted, thence to disappear for ever.
We take our time with Jane Austen or George Eliot or Dickens. We make
our entrances and our exits in stately fashion. We take time with our
characters for the story to unfold, and we do all this in the comforting
knowledge that we will not be left dangling in the air by the plot as we
so often are with contemporary drama.
Neither, in the main, are we required to make our own moral judgments
in the classic serial, for the writers liked to direct us towards their
conclusions, an attractive prospect seen from the moral minefield of the
late twentieth century. And while having someone else make the big
decisions might not work in life, it suits us well enough, from the
comfort of an armchair on a Sunday night.
If we had a real time machine we should find out the truth of the
thing, the disorders and dark areas and shady truths which are there in
the books but somehow, for reasons of practicality, seldom seem to stand
out the same way on the screen.
We should find out there never was an easy age of moral certainties,
never a glorious world of romance, for instance, when men were men and
women were women and everyone the better for it.
Never mind. Darcy is to dream for, and twice a week now, courtesy of
television, wooing Elizabeth in the proper pre-Pill manner. And all
without the benefit of an ad in the Guardian.
Saturday's repeat on BBC2, especially shown, incidentally, for pupils
studying the book at school, makes Jane's weekly viewership figures a
very healthy 11 million plus. It's the sort of figure a contemporary
drama on ITV would consider respectable.
Penguin, who scooped a surprise best seller with a special TV tie-in
of Middlemarch are now doing the same with Pride and Prejudice.
It puts Jane in a different class you might think. Good heavens, it
makes her positively commercial.
Just think what Miss Bingley who so despises trade would think of
that.

RETAILING
A FORMER chief executive of Country Casuals -- the womenswear clothes
chain -- has approached the company with a view to making a takeover
bid, it was disclosed yesterday.
John Shannon, who now controls Ciro Holdings, left Country Casuals a
year ago, immediately after it issued a profits warning for the year to
January 1995.
But the group dismissed a possible offer, saying it was likely to
undervalue the company.
''The board believes that the timing of the approach is opportunistic
and that the level of the possible offer does not reflect the potential
of the group,'' a statement said.
It added that recent half-year results reflected the considerable
progress made under the new management.

LLOYD'S of London yesterday said it expects to bounce back into profit
this year and to complete an ambitious plan to modernise the
300-year-old insurance market next year.
Based on the year so far and barring disasters, chairman David Rowland
said Lloyd's was heading for a profit this year.
''At the moment my colleagues in the market are pretty optimistic
about 1995,'' he told a news conference to outline progress on a
reconstruction and renewal plan announced in May.
Three-quarters of current Lloyd's underwriters had traded successfully
through the worst period in the market's history, he noted.
Lloyd's, which announces its results three years in arrears, suffered
record losses of more than #8000m in the years 1988 to 1992.
These years included an unprecedented concentration of natural and
man-made disasters, including hurricanes Hugo and Andrew and the Piper
Alpha and Exxon Valdez oil disasters.
So far this year, Lloyd's has not been hit by any exceptional claims
and the US hurricane season has produced nothing to match the record
damage of Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
Mr Rowland also said Lloyd's plan to end litigation by the market's
backers, known as names, and aimed at putting the insurance market's
problems behind it was on target for implementation next spring.
Under the plan, names will be asked to end all litigation over
compensation for their losses in exchange for a #2800m settlement
package.
Lloyd's is also setting up a new reinsurance company, Equitas, which
will take over all the market's 1992 and prior liabilities, thus freeing
names who wish to retire from Lloyd's.
Lloyd's chief executive Peter Middleton said work on financing
Equitas, the biggest project of its kind in the world, was well
advanced. -- Reuter.

COMPANIES increasingly have to think globally and strip layers from
their organisation if they are to compete in world markets.
One company that is in the throes of such reorganisation is Reckitt &amp;
Colman, the international household products and pharmaceutical group
whose brands include Dettol, Harpic and Lemsip.
It is an interesting time in its history. One man who is currently
busy expanding his knowledge of the group is Alan Dalby who became
non-executive chairman of Reckitt &amp; Colman on September 1, succeeding
Sir Michael Colman.
In March, the group sold its famous Colman's mustard and Robinson's
soft drinks business in order to concentrate on developing its household
products business.
Dalby joined the board as a non-executive director in September 1987,
following his retirement from SmithKline Beckman, the US predecessor
company to SmithKline Beecham.
His experience of the US consumer products market will be invaluable
to Reckitt &amp; Colman which has spent $2500m (#1580m), in the past two
years acquiring US businesses. The most recent purchase being the
$1500m, (#948m), purchase of L &amp; F Household, the leading US household
products group.
Dalby himself sees his role as proactive, advising on strategy and
board appointiments. He believes that ''new product innovation is key to
growth in all areas''.
It is all a long way from Glasgow where Dalby was born in 1937. He
attended Queen's Park High School. At the age of 21, he did what many
young people do at that age, travelled abroad. The only difference being
he never came back. He went to Montreal with some friends and joined
SmithKline where he stayed for 30 years.
Dalby became a Canadian citizen and later an American citizen
following a move to SmithKline in Philadelphia. At the same time his
role within the company changed from analytical chemist to general
management and marketing.
His career at SmithKline culminated with his appointment as executive
vice-president and a main board director from 1980 to 1987. Following
his retirement in 1987, Dalby said he ''made a decision not to go back
to big corporate life''.
Instead he helped found Cambridge NeuroScience, a biotechnology
company specialising in neurobiology. He says it was an ''opportunity to
use a great deal of my experience gained at SmithKline'' and a chance to
build a business which is, ''often more fun''.
As chairman and chief executive, Dalby attracted Harvard Management as
an investor and took the company public in 1991. He retired from
Cambridge NeuroScience in May 1994.
He enjoys golf, gardening and travel. He and his wife have four homes
in Boston, Cape Cod, London and the US Virgin Islands. Dalby considers
himself an American but still has close family ties in Scotland, where
his father, two brothers and a sister live. However, he finds Glasgow
''unbelievably different from the way it used to be'' and suspects that
he would have difficulty finding his way around.

SHARES in Edinburgh-based Morrison Construction Group start trading on
the Stock Exchange today after being placed at a strike price of 115p
last week.
Most of the #25m worth of shares have been placed with London and
Edinburgh-based institutional investors, but about #2.25m have been
purchased by individuals, including Morrison employees.
There was a 91% take-up of shares made available to individual
investors through stockbrokers in the intermediaries offer and company
chairman Fraser Morrison said he was ''delighted'' with the result.
More than 500 of Morrison's 1700 employees subscribed for shares
through the offer, mostly through a new employee share save scheme.
Despite the gloom enveloping most of the construction industry,
Morrison is convinced that its wide range of activities and its
aggressive methods of seeking out new business will guarantee its
continued success.
''We believe that our strategy sets us apart from the uncertainty
surrounding the sector and that private investors appreciate the value
of this strategy,'' Mr Morrison said, commenting on the high take-up of
shares.
Craig Armour of merchant bank Noble Grossart, which sponsored the
placing, said it was impossible to predict how the shares would perform
on their first day of trading.
''The conventional wisdom is that a successful flotation is just above
the strike price,'' he said. ''Clearly what people are hoping for is
steady market and a slight premium.''
Nearly 21.8 million shares have been sold through the placing and
intermediaries offer, but the directors of Morrison, their families and
associated trusts continue to own 61.8% of the company.

SCOTTISHPOWER is likely to win control of Manweb by the time its
#1100m hostile bid closes at 1pm today, in spite of rejection by the
Chester-based distributor's largest institutional shareholder,
Prudential.
The Glasgow-based utility is already assured of about 40% of Manweb,
with Standard Life and Legal &amp; General, which each hold about 3%, having
decided to accept.
But, with Prudential thought to be among a number of dissenting
institutions holding about 15% of Manweb between them, the hostile bid
is unlikely to be the walkover which some had envisaged.
BZW Investment Management, which owns about 2% of the Chester-based
company, and Norwich Union, with 3%, had by yesterday made their
decisions but there were no clues as to what these were.
Manweb chief executive John Roberts and finance director Stuart
Siddall have been trying hard to drum up institutional support this
week, apparently with some success.
A Manweb official said yesterday: ''There have been some institutions,
which would prefer to remain nameless, which have indicated very clearly
that they will support the (Manweb) management.''
ScottishPower is taking no chances and has in the last week bombarded
small shareholders in Manweb's Merseyside and North Wales patch with
prime-time television and radio advertisements, as well as lorries
carrying huge advertising hoardings.
The total cost of the adverts on HTV and Granada, which are running
during Coronation Street in English and Welsh, is #300,000, on top of
the #34m which ScottishPower is paying its army of advisers.
ScottishPower has done virtually everything it could have in the open
market to ensure success. Yesterday, it increased its own stake in
Manweb from 27% to 28%, only a whisker short of the 29.9% it is allowed
to buy in this manner.
Taken with acceptances already secured, mainly from private
shareholders, in respect of 6% of Manweb, and safe in the knowledge that
it can count on Standard Life and Legal &amp; General's stakes,
ScottishPower requires only another 10% to win control.
The only potential spanner in the works is that, as a privatised
utility, Manweb has an unusually high proportion of private
shareholders. About 114,000 individuals hold nearly 25% of its shares.
Regional loyalty and the number of Manweb employee-shareholders may be
against ScottishPower but, given that the vast majority of the work has
already been done, these factors would be unlikely to scupper the bid.
If ScottishPower did fail, its offer would lapse and it would be
unable to mount another bid for Manweb within 12 months.
ScottishPower has been cold-calling private shareholders. On Tuesday
night, Manweb company secretary Nick Williams, was summoned from his
bath by such a telephone call. Next day his wife received a similar
call.
Graham Wood, head of UK equities at Edinburgh-based Standard Life,
yesterday confirmed the mutual's acceptance of the offer. It will take
ScottishPower's cash-plus-shares terms, currently worth 1004p, for some
of its shares, parting with the remainder for the cash alternative of
990p.
Wood, who believed the bid was ''fair but not over-generous'', said:
''I think ScottishPower has a better record of effecting efficiency
improvements and there are some synergy benefits.''
In making their decisions, institutions will have been weighing
Manweb's defence package, which is worth 605p-a-share to them, and the
value of the Chester-based company's ''rump'' against the ScottishPower
offer. The rump value is being estimated with reference to the share
price of Northern Electric, which has gone through an exercise similar
to Manweb's defence proposals.
London-based Threadneedle Investment Management was among the
institutions which sold in the market to ScottishPower on Wednesday.
Jonathan Barber, senior fund manager at Threadneedle, said it had
decided to exit because it considered ScottishPower's offer, though not
necessarily overly-generous, to be worth more than Manweb's defence
package and rump.
Assuming ScottishPower is successful, the City's attention will switch
to the particular mix of cash and shares which it will have to pay out,
and the consequent impact on ScottishPower's future earnings per share
and gearing.
Bill McCall, an Edinburgh-based director of stockbroker Tilney,
questioned whether ScottishPower and Manweb management would be able to
''bury the hatchet'' in the wake of a successful takeover.
He said: ''These companies have been at each other's throats for three
months. It strikes me there are some people in there who just do not
like each other.''
Yesterday, the posturing continued, with the Manweb official
describing the situation as ''too close to call'' and again claiming the
ScottishPower offer undervalued the company.
ScottishPower chief executive Ian Robinson, for his part, repeated the
familiar ''full and fair'' bid line, adding: ''We are confident that
this will be reflected when the deadline for acceptances closes.''
Shares in Manweb yesterday added 4p to 995p, with ScottishPower
advancing 1[1/2]p to 352p.

FISONS wasted little time yesterday morning in rejecting as inadequate
the long-awaited increased offer from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer for the
Ipswich-based pharmaceuticals group.
The Franco-American chemicals company has raised its cash offer by 25p
to 265p to value Fisons at #1830m and has declared the bid final subject
to conditions.
It is believed that in recent days, RPR has been sounding out
institutions about the price level at which they would be prepared to
surrender Fisons' independence.
After the improved terms were announced, its broker Hoare Govett bid
the market for shares at the 265p offer price and was swamped with stock
with over 212 million shares changing hands.
The stock closed 4[1/2]p better at 263[1/2]p which indicated
everything was over bar the shouting.
The offer closes on October 20.
The emergence of a white knight now seems most unlikely with RPR now
in a strong strategic position. Many funds are unable to accept an offer
until the last day in any takeover in case a higher counter-bid can be
flushed out.
As Fisons chief executive Stuart Wallis has said nothing on that
possibility in his final formal defence statement, it is assumed there
is no-one else prepared to enter the fray.
RPR chairman Robert Cawthorn said that the choice for Fisons
shareholders is whether to accept the generous cash offer now or to hope
that Fisons can achieve major future profit growth with its high-risk
strategy.
He added that the facts behind the Fisons forecast results for 1995
and estimates for 1996 show that profits growth will come almost
exclusively from unusual items.
There will be no meaningful growth to come from the mature product
portfolio and Fisons has no new products in the pipeline.
Its device technology, while good, is far from unique and is years
away from making any impact on profits.
Mr Wallis retorted that if RPR wants a recommendation from the Fisons
board that shareholders accept, then it would have to raise its bid
again.

Loyalty discount cards are offering huge bargains to canny supermarket
customers, but as Anna Burnside discovers, they are also revealing
intimate details of their personal lives and shopping habits
THE idea is simplicity itself. Supermarket wants loyal customers.
Customer loves idea of getting a bargain. Supermarket gives customer a
card that earns points for each pound spent, resulting in eventual
discount, freebie, or other small treat.
Customer does all shopping at that supermarket to maximise points.
Supermarket coins it in.
The sneerers who said that plastic Green Shield stamps would never
catch on have had the smirks wiped off their faces by the remarkable
success of Tesco's nationwide discount card. The credit card-style
Clubcard, launched in February at an estimated cost of #10m, hit paydirt
when its interim profits were announced last month. Clubcard is taking
the credit for a 16% rise in profits and the fastest sales growth in the
grocery trade.
Anyone can pick up a card at one of Tesco's 62 Scottish outlets and
start collecting points. The card is put through the till before the
messages are rung up, and the points appear on the till receipt. Two
points are awarded for the first #10 spent (and none if you spend less),
then one more for every additional #5.
Each quarter these points are converted into discount vouchers which
are sent to the card holder's home. The second batch went out in August
this year, when five million card holders who had 50 points or more
shared coupons worth #12m.
That is a lot of shopping. To get #3.75 off your messages, you need 75
points. To collect 75 points you must spend #375 over three months, with
a minimum of a tenner's worth each time. No sneaking up the total with
quick purchases of newspapers and packets of chewing gum.
To qualify for the top discount (#7.50) it's necessary to spend #750.
They're not called loyalty cards for nothing -- Clubcard holders, it
appears, may forswear the charms of all other supermarkets to maximise
their savings at Tesco.
As well as the discount vouchers, which can be used to pay for
anything in the store -- petrol, cigarettes, and lottery tickets as well
as toilet rolls and beans -- each Clubcard mailing includes money off
coupons for selected Tesco items. Surprise surprise! These are not
petrol, cigarettes, lottery tickets, toilet rolls, or beans, but
high-value items such as fresh chickens and Australian wines. Just a
little extra to help shoppers on the way to stacking up their next raft
of discount points.
Students and pensioners, who live in smaller households and spend
less, now have their own Clubcards. They only have to spend a fiver
before the points start kicking in, and the students get their money-off
vouchers after spending #195 a quarter. Tesco representatives have been
signing up students at campuses across Scotland and report a good
response.
Retail analyst Clive Vaughn reckons the Clubcard is one explanation
for Tesco's success in a market place where others are struggling.
''It's a major result for a small discount. It has stampeded Safeway and
others into introducing schemes of their own -- they're not going to let
Tesco get away with it.''
Taking over William Low and introducing the Clubcard has helped Tesco
into second equal place with Asda in the Scottish supermarket chart.
Asda, with 204 stores (27 in Scotland), is testing a variety of
different loyalty cards in 16 branches, with no immediate plans for a
nationwide scheme.
All the schemes are based on collecting points, with incentives
ranging from straightforward 1% discount vouchers (on trial in Linwood)
to gifts from a catalogue (in Perth). Cut-price weekend breaks and
discounts on George clothing are the other variations on trial.
Sainsbury's, which lost the battle with Tesco to buy William Low, has
only four stores in Scotland. They have a Saver Card on a six-month test
in 112 of their 356 English stores, with a promise of up to #50 off
grocery bills in the run-up to Christmas.
Safeway offers customers an ABC discount card in 130 stores, including
22 in Scotland. These are chosen on a ''tactical marketing basis'',
branches where even the mighty Argyll group, Scotland's leading
supermarket firm, needs a little extra help. The ABC card gives the same
1% discount that Tesco offers, but with no lower limit on spending.
Every pound counts towards discounts, and customers can enjoy their
first #1 off as soon as they have spent #100.
The stores get more than loyalty from their loyalty card holders. They
get a good deal of extremely useful marketing information. The cards are
swiped through the till before the shopping is rung up, allowing details
of every item in the trolley to be stored beside the cardholder's
details. Shoppers are telling these stores where they live, what they
buy, when and how they pay for it.
Other companies pay a good deal of money for this type of gen on their
customers -- in return for a 1% discount , Tesco has a database of
in-depth details on five million regular customers.
Clive Vaughn predicts that this is when the cards will really start
earning their keep. ''In the first instance they link loyalty with small
discounts and added value, so consumers are doing all their spending at
your store and not with your rivals.
''Their software allows them to analyse purchasing patterns and break
down their customers into lifestyle groups. They can then target these
customers with appropriate promotions, so young single men who buy beer
and TV dinners don't get a special offer on disposable nappies. It will
allow the stores to be far more relevant, intelligent, and
cost-effective.''
Clubcard shoppers at TescoUs Broughton Road branch, in Edinburgh, were
a quite a loyal bunch, but showed no signs of spending more to save
more. ''I get what I want and that's it,'' said Mrs Elizabeth Sinclair.
''I don't always shop at Tesco, it depends what I need, but I think
it's worth having the card,'' said Ms Lorna Dunbar, packing fresh
coriander and fruity yoghurts into carriers. ''I'm not buying anything I
wouldn't be buying anyway.
James and Isabel Wright claim to do 95% of their shopping at Tesco.
''The card has made us more likely to shop here because we get something
off each time, we do benefit slightly.'' Mrs Elaine Dodds uses nearby
Tesco to buy her oven chips and kitchen rolls, but the Clubcard has not
inspired her to spend a lot on extras. ''I still buy my luxuries
elsewhere,'' she said.

BRIAN Stewart, managing director of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, was named
last night as the fourth overall winner of the Scottish Business Insider
Leadership Awards at a dinner in Edinburgh.
Mr Stewart, 50, who also won the category for manufacturing, was
chosen by the votes of 300 of his peers in business and industry across
Scotland. The awards are jointly sponsored by the magazine and financial
advisers, Ernst &amp; Young.
Other winners were Sir Bruce Pattullo, governor of the Bank of
Scotland, in the finance category; David Michels, chief executive of
Stakis in the service category and Donald MacKay, chairman of Scottish
Enterprise in the public sector group.
This year a further award, for an Unsung Hero, was made to John Ward,
recently retired as Director Scotland for IBM (UK), for his work in the
fields of education, training and quality.
The choice of the quiet-spoken Mr Stewart for the main leadership
award reflected his key role in transforming Scottish &amp; Newcastle into
the UK's number one brewer, thanks to the successful bid for Courage.
But it also reflected the earlier restructuring and repositioning of
S&amp;N through the timely sale of its Thistle Hotel chain, and the
purchases of Center Parcs and the Chef &amp; Brewer chain of pubs.
Donald Turner of Ernst &amp; Young said Mr Stewart had helped put Scottish
&amp; Newcastle back in its rightful place as a top-class British company
based in Scotland.

WITH ''sweatshop'' pay rates condemned at this week's Labour

GEORGE Birrell is delighted that before the Borussia Dortmund match at
Ibrox, Rangers fans lustily sang ''Rule Britannia'' instead of that
nationalist dirge ''The Flower of Scotland'' (September 30).
Surely this should be no surprise to anyone for Rangers fans wave and
drape themselves in the Union Flag. Is this not the recognised banner of
the supporters (no doubt including hooligans) of English football clubs?
As one who served at sea during the last war, I, too, am delighted at
never seeing a group of young Scots, wearing blue and white St Andrews
Cross shorts, charging down the streets of an Ibiza town and screaming
''Kill the Krauts''.
I have, however, been disgusted to witness exactly that, by those
draped in red, white, and blue, and no doubt, including ''Rule
Britannia'' in their repertoire.

A BORING window where nothing catches the eye is hardly likely to coax
us from the street into the shop. The window is the shop's face, its
identity; the display reflects the merchandise we can expect to find
inside, whether it be expensive goods, novelties, or bargains, and it
deliberately projects an image that appeals to the shop's desired
customers. Imaginative window dressing can hook passersby and reel them
in; shop owners know this and depend on it. The window is the first step
towards a sale.
We may think we enter a shop of our own free will, but, in fact, there
is an unseen army of market surveyors trying its best to make sure we
do. They know the products we want and the width of our wallets; and
they know which ploys work the best. Shoppers are even subdivided into
groups from A to E, ranging from the extremely wealthy through to
pensioners, students, and the unemployed.
Liz Baillie, manager of speciality shopping centre Princes Square off
Buchanan Street, Glasgow, says windows are of the utmost importance in
speciality shopping.
''The shops here are not high-street multiples. They pick out one or
two items and specialise in that -- it's not everyday, convenience
shopping.'' Princes Square shops don't have what people need but what
they might want, forcing the shop fronts to compete for the customer's
attention.
''Before shops move in here we have to see their planning. They are
not allowed to put big sale signage in the window -- only 15% can be
taken up. It maintains the standards we're looking for,'' Baillie said.
Menswear shop Ted Bakers has an outlet in Princes Square, and is known
for its groovy, funny, and distinctive window displays. Chris Brown,
national sales director, says humour is the key. ''I'm amazed that more
people don't use humour in their windows,'' he said. ''Apart from
anything else, it lets people get an idea of our style of business --
it's more enjoyable for everyone if there's something funny going on.''
Ted Bakers has a history of hilarious window displays, including a
gyrating, latex-clad Elvis surrounded by stars wearing Ted Baker shirts;
a Christmas window with a trussed-up Santa being roasted and turkeys
flying beside him with knives and forks, accompanied by the caption:
''Revenge of the Christmas turkeys''; and a winter display of shaved
sheep standing beside a pile of woolly jumpers.
''Once we had four dictionary definitions in the window about what
shops really mean by 'further reductions' and 'last week only.' We were
taking the mickey out of other retailers. We've built up a bit of a
reputation and have traded well because of it. We seem to appeal to a
wide range of guys, from those with some cash to the lads off the
building site.
''A lot of stores just stick stuff on mannequins. I think shops should
take more advantage of humour, but I suppose if you're selling something
worth thousands it's not so funny, '' says Elaine Webster, visual
merchandise manager for House of Fraser.
''Every merchandise should be treated differently, but I do feel that
expensive merchandise, such as jewellery, should have a nice and sharp
display with no fuss,'' she said.
''The window is extremely important. It's our first salesman. What the
customer sees in the window should reflect the good-looking merchandise
for sale. We have a lot of high-class designer names and that attracts a
certain type of customer, but at Fraser's there is really something for
everyone. In the windows, we change the stock each week and the theme
each month, and pay great attention to detail.''
At the other end of the spectrum are the discount retailers such as
Poundscretcher, bright yellow and red with bold ''bonanza'' signs and
hanging banners. Discounters don't mess about with simplicity and
understatement. As Angela O'Leary, deputy manager of Trongate
Poundstretcher in Glasgow points out, the main message the window
displays have to convey is that the goods are cheap.
''It's the prices in the windows that draw the customers -- that's how
they know they're getting good value for money,'' she said.
Clive Kay, spokesperson for the discount store What Everyone Wants,
believes the window has to capture the imagination of the passerby. In
the past, window dressing for What Everyone Wants has been as garish and
exaggerated as the best of them, but market research has demonstrated
that customers are more attracted to subdued displays.
''We're still aggressive, but the colours are softer, more
fashionable. We used to paint the place red for a sale -- it adds to the
drama, the excitement -- but we're toning it down a lot more,'' he said.
''We've done a lot of research on our regular customers, and they want
an uncluttered look. Basically, our windows are appealing to every man
in the street. C, D, and E customers represent 65% of this country, but
we get A and B customers, too. It depends very much what's on offer; if
you get the right thing, like aerobic wear or cut-price perfume, we can
cut across all barriers.
''Our graphics are now only going to be informative; the days of
horrendous graphic pollution are over.''
That may be so, but What Everyone Wants is a far cry from the
minimalist allure of The Gallery, across the road in Glassford Street.
The windows boast solitary mannequins, their heads shrouded in cloudy
tissue paper, to draw more attention to the beautiful designer clothes
they wear.
''I think anything that stands out by itself looks classier,'' said
Jim Kerr, who dresses The Gallery's windows. ''With one model for each
window, people can concentrate on just one outfit. It gives a look of
luxury, all that space to itself -- it reflects the space inside the
shop.''
Kerr is not fond of mannequins. After all, no woman actually looks
like these bizarre versions of reality, with their candlestick legs and
that curious, glossy eggshell finish.
''I don't want people looking at the mannequins and thinking: 'Well, I
can't look like that', so I get rid of the mannequins heads by covering
them.
''We aim for a grown-up market, people from 25 to 60 who can identify
with the style and fabrics without having to be the latest thing. In the
windows I try to have it so nothing detracts from the clothes.''
Novelty shops are less dependent on the image they project than high
street chains, discount retailers, or expensive boutiques. Frank
Griffin, proprietor of ''the new age, futuristic and fantasy'' gift shop
Starchasers, says the merchandise in his windows has universal appeal --
although shoppers don't typically set out thinking they must get some of
that holographic wrapping paper.
''Our windows are very important because most of our trade is people
just passing by. To tell you the truth, people get dazzled by our
display and they have come back to have a look,'' he said.
''We have enough items to fill the show windows, with laser-etched
holographic mobiles that catch the light and give a burst of colour and
hanging lead crystals which fill the shop with rainbows. ''
For some, it is the gleaming, inventive promise of the newest
technological gadgetry that will draw them into a shop. For others, the
''all stock half-price'' signs get them every time. Still others stand
transfixed in front of impossibly thin mannequins draped in arabesques
of dreamy lace and powder blue satin, filmy skirts skimming prefect
knees.
Whatever it is that lures us from admiring the window to inside the
store, be sure that it's the result of careful planning and research.
Retailing these days is a tough trade and very little, it seems, is left
to chance.

IT is not just Tottenham Hotspur Football Club and Terry Venables that
have caused Alan Sugar some grief over the past few years. His consumer
electronics group Amstrad has also had its ups and downs and in December
1992, Sugar made a buy-back bid at 30p a share.
The shares were consolidated on a five-for-one basis at the end of
November last year. This year there has been a return of confidence and
yesterday the shares stood at 261[1/2]p, up 5[1/2]p, approaching the
year's ''high'' of 277p having risen from a low of 127[1/2]p in January.
Some reward at last for those shareholders who remained loyal during the
dark days.
The group, which has moved back into the black at the pre-tax level in
the year to June 30 after the losses of the previous 12 months, is now
actively looking for new opportunities to expand, both organically and
through acquisitions.
Amstrad's traditional consumer electronics is still showing losses --
with the continuing operations in the red by #16m against #26m last time
-- but these have been curtailed dramatically, a process which is
expected to continue. Acquisitions contributed #11.3m so that operating
losses fell from #26.5m to #5.2m. After interest of #7.2m -- reflecting
a healthy balance sheet with net cash of #141.9m, up #4.2m -- little
changed from the preceding year -- Amstrad moved into the black ahead of
tax.
Amstrad's mobile phone business, Dancall, suffered from a delay in
start-up production but is now well under way with a healthy order book.
And Viglen, which sells personal computers direct, was ahead of
expectations. A new automated factory was set up during the year capable
of satisfying the expected growth in sales.
Sugar says Amstrad is now clearly divisionalised into its various
activities. Liquidity remains an important factor and he is confident
that the combined potential of Dancall and Viglen will form a solid base
of profitability in the future.
The control of the traditional consumer electronics business remains
important as is building the new ventures of Amstrad Direct and
Dataflex. An unchanged final dividend leaves the total on hold at 2.5p.

CAIRN Energy said yesterday that its recently acquired Dutch
subsidiary Holland Sea Search Holdings (HSSH) would be a direct
beneficiary of Elf's latest gas find in the Dutch sector of the North
Sea.
The Edinburgh-based independent oil company said HSSH would probably
end up with a 1.8% equity stake in Elf's newly discovered J3a-J6 Charlie
gas field.
This would give it an additional 1,000,000 cubic feet of gas per day
when the field starts commercial production in about three months time.
HSSH will also receive tariff revenue from the Markham A platform and
pipeline system, through which the gas will be brought ashore.
Cairn chief executive Bill Gammell said the gas find would boost the
value of HSSH, which Cairn bought for #17.3m earlier this year by 10% to
15%.
It could be worth an additional #2m to #3m for us,'' he said.
Cairn will earn about #500,000 per year of additional revenue from the
new gas field, Mr Gammell added.
The discovery well tested at 56,000,000 cubic feet per day and Mr
Gammell said he expected commercial production to be held at a similar
rate.
Cairn shares were unchanged at 101p.

THERE has been great debate this week about the role of grammar
schools, or academies as we tend to call them in Scotland. Are they a
focus of educational snobbery or do they offer greater opportunities for
our brighter and harder-working pupils?
We hear of a wee story from Strathaven Academy, a well-known south
Lanarkshire college of knowledge. The assembled masses of fifth and
sixth year were addressed, even harangued say some, by the head teacher.
The subject was the school's results last year in the Highers and the
heidie, Mr Cameron Dick, hinted forcefully that he was fed up with
under-achievement.
Consequently, the new fifth year was to be the subject of an
initiative which involved a selection process. Those who had scored five
or more maximum marks at Standard grade (22 out of 160 or so) were
henceforth to be referred to as the school's ''Top Guns''.
The 22 Top Guns were to be the focus of special attention from the
teaching staff. A parent of one of the 130 non-Top Guns writes to point
out that these lower-orders might feel a failure before they even start
on the great Highers assault course.
The parent also wonders what name the Strathaven heidie might come up
for the group of non-Top Guns. Suggestions directly to Mr D C Dick,
Strathaven Academy, Crawford Street, Strathaven.
Say it loud
GREAT company slogans of our time: the lorries of Albar Landscaping of
Barrhead, who sell turf with which to create instant lawns, bear the
words: ''Don't seed it, sod it''. Hamilton Dairies, of the Mains Farm,
East Kilbride, now merged with Wiseman's, for many years boasted: ''Milk
from the Mains builds bonnie wee weans''. And finally, the UK Bungee
Club are promoting their own (presumably bouncy) credit card with the
phrase ''fantastic plastic for lovers of elastic''.
Tough at the top
BURGER King featured in the public prints recently with accusations
that their young workers were being laid off during quiet periods of the
day, resulting in hourly rates of pay as low as 20p. The Diary cannot
pass judgment on this.
But we can pass on the eye-witness experience of a Bishopbriggs
correspondent who was in a Burger King premises in search of sustenance.
She asked for a carton of juice, only to be told by the male assistant
that they were out of juice. Asking for a strawberry milkshake instead,
she was told that they didn't have any of that either.
Finally, asking for tomato sauce for her burger, she was again told
that they were out of that. ''In fact,'' said the salesperson, ''the
only thing we're not out of is crap managers.''
Plant hire
A WORD of caution for anyone thinking of taking Strathclyde Police's
advice to plant suitably vicious foliage round their houses to deter
burglars. Dr Mary Church, a Blantyre GP, tells us that she and her
colleagues went to some expense to have thorny rose bushes planted round
their surgery to protect it from intruders. The bushes were stolen next
day.
Nothing but trouble
OUR collection of acrimonious acronyms increases. An insider at the
Scottish Office tells us that the Science and Technology Unit Scottish
Higher Education is known as STUSHE and this appears to be entirely
appropriate.
Don't ask us
IT seems that however hard the Diary tries to get away from beer, the
stuff just will not leave us alone. We are sent the Beer Cellar's 1996
catalogue of ales from all over the world. Among other delights it
offers the MacQueens Nessie Whisky beer from Austria.
It is billed as ''rich, powerful and smokey'' which might mean that it
tastes like a combination of a pint of heavy and a packet of smokey
bacon crisps. Despite its name, there is not actually any whisky in
MacQueens Nessie Whisky beer. We are unable to establish where the Loch
Ness monster comes into it and are unwilling to speculate.
Onward Christian solderers
WE are receipt of a Church of Scotland leaflet detailing ''Renewal in
Priority Areas''. It transpires that a priority area is Kyleakin on the
Isle of Skye where ''the congregation has begun a twice-weekly club for
young folk, encouraging them in their spiritual and social development.
The club helps the congregation to build bridges . . .''
No, not that big bridge. Bridges with those who have lost contact with
the church.
Donkey work
FLICKING through the Threshers' wine catalogue, as one does, we find
bad news about Spanish donkeys. Not the stuffed variety which used to be
found on airport luggage carousels. No, we are talking about the common
or garden, working little Spanish donkey making its way along the road
with pannier on its back.
They are a disappearing species, according to the author of the
aforementioned catalogue, Mr David Howse, whose job appears to be
visiting vineyards and writing about the products. (Did you see that job
advertised? We didn't.)
Anyway, Mr Howse was in a Spanish vineyard gravely discussing with a
local the demise of the donkey when he was informed of the reason. Since
Spain had become a member of the European Union, the laws of the
Brussels bureaucrats now applied.
While in a field, a donkey was a donkey. But when it went on to a
main, a donkey became an ''agricultural vehicle'' and had to be equipped
with a flashing orange light, which was too much bother for your average
donkey driver.
Sounds like a very convincing story if heard over a bottle or two of
Threshers' rioja.

AN AYRSHIRE bowling club is locked into a legal dispute over the
expulsion of a woman member for being improperly dressed (the woman, not
the club, but such are the standards employed by the modern sub-editor)
at the club dance. It turns out that the lady, a Mrs McLaughlan, was
alleged to have taken off her knickers and ''then made an issue of her
state of undress with the vice-president and bar staff''.
Undress is right. If Mrs McLaughlan was cavorting about with no
knickers then she was improperly undressed I should have said, or maybe
not unless it was your business as the vice-president or whatever to go
around examining lady members and guests for the presence of knickers.
But it all gets better.
The good lady tells us that she was wearing an expensive evening gown
and did indeed go into the ladies and remove her elasticated pants and
put them in her husband's jacket pocket, which must have been somewhat
of a surprise to her husband really when he ventured into the pocket for
his hanky. Said this intrepid woman. ''That is all. Surely that is
between us'', meaning the husband.
As far as I can see there was nothing at all at that moment between
her hubby and herself, except of course the expensive evening dress, but
I still can't quite grasp, if that is the right word, why Mrs McLaughlan
wanted to take off her drawers, or why she didn't do what I suspect most
ladies would have done, if they should be inclined to the removal of
bloomers -- put them in her handbag along with the other intimacies
which females accumulate in their purses.
It got even more splendid later on. Said a wonderfully orotund Bowling
Club secretary: ''As far as we are concerned the matter'' (we rather
hope not the pair of knickers), ''is in the hands of our solicitor''. I
like it. It has a ring to it. Its smacks of an Olympian detachment from
scandal. Secretary William Fulton goes on to state that his club is
''not prepared to wash our dirty linen in public''. And I should think
not. Even Mrs McLaughlan's.
But it does lead one to think upon the very phrase ''improperly
dressed''. I have spent a lifetime being improperly dressed, usually, in
fact, over dressed. Sent home from school for a bumfreezer blazer,
drainpipes, white socks, winkle-picker shoes, dumb-insolence, and too
much intelligence. It has been so since, if you can say so since.
I have been ever since getting sent home for wearing, at least
metaphorically, the bumfreezer and tantalising winklepickers and white
socks and the rest of the improperly dressed states of mind of which
lady journalists and Labour politicians disapprove. In actuality most
people in the media biz do indeed disapprove of my dress, mainly because
I wear blazingly white shirts and sport ties and refulgent brogans, and
have creases in my breeks which would shard Parmesan cheese. Labour
politicians today are dressed to look as though they are the sort of
chaps who have just sacked all the tellers in the Clydesdale Bank but
don't want to show off too much about it and lady journalists think a
well-dressed man is a kerb-crawler who ought to be revealed to the
nation.
Neither of the above species has any idea at all of what the
implications are concerning the difficulties in which our knickerless
lady bowler had found herself, or indeed into which sort of minefield of
sartorial drivel she has wandered.
For the dress requirements of most bowling clubs are byzantine enough
for a Masonic Lodge in Babel. Women are required -- even young girls --
to adorn themselves in dreadful grey skirts and hats and flat shoes and
aren't allowed into the hallowed bar unless they are making sandwiches
and don't get on the greens at weekends and lots of other things.
Young men and boys are shooting lightening through the skies at
bowling because, being young, they are good at hand and eye
co-ordination and the rest if it. Girls would be as well but they are
damned if they will be constricted by demands of what makes up, in the
eyes of bowling club secretaries, appropriate dress.
The appropriate dress for bowling club secretaries is a blazer with
badges, flannels which they have worn for 11 years, and brains which
have an ever-deeper centre parting than their sparse hair can manage to
accomplish. Very, very, like Labour politicians really. And if lady
journalists took offence at what I have written above, well, I cannae
help that. I just wish there were more hacks and politicos who wore
improper dress. Or a dress at all, if it comes to that.

IN his column on September 30, George Birrell revealed a bad case of
nostalgia for the supposedly great days of the British Empire. He
prefers ''Rule Britannia'' to ''The Flower of Scotland'' He laments the
loss of ''the feel-good factor when Scots and the English felt a
Christian mission to scatter the spores of our civilisation''.
Presumably he has noticed that Britannia no longer rules the waves and
that those on whom the spores were scattered were only too anxious to
dispense with the privilege. All of these countries are now independent
(with the odd exception such as Scotland) and none of them regrets the
change.
Birrell also seems to admire the Parliament at Westminster. He thinks
that it would be ''a shame and a waste'' if George Robertson gave up his
seat there in exchange for one in a Scottish parliament.
Has he failed to notice that Westminster has long lost any reputation
which it once had as a model of democracy? It has an electoral system
which gives absolute power to the leader of a party supported by only a
minority of the electorate. It is antiquated, corrupt, absurd, and
largely impotent. As long as a Prime Minister can control his or her own
party, he or she controls the House of Commons.
A restored Scottish parliament will be able to make a fresh start and
avoid the bad example of Westminster.
Birrell regrets a growing hostility to England, but he fails to see
the cause. Of course, there are many historical roots, but the real
reason is much more recent. For 16 years we have had policies which we
detest imposed on us by a party which we have soundly rejected at the
polls, but which a sufficiently large minority of English voters have
chosen.
To be ruled from the outside by people with different interests and
standards of value is the essence of colonialism which is universally
regarded as intolerable. In these circumstances is it any wonder that
people resent and blame the English?
Certainly it is desirable to have good relations with our English
neighbours, but this is only likely when we are no longer subject to
remote control from London. When we stand on our own feet as a free and
equal partner on the European Union, we can treat one another as close
allies and friends, not as master and dependant.
The English in the great majority are a fair-minded people and have
understood this point in scores of formerly dependent territories.
Recent opinion polls have suggested that they understand it in our case
as well.
In an earlier piece (September 7) George Birrell described the SNP
policy of independence in Europe as spurious. The aim of the policy is
the same degree of independence as any other member of the European
Union. Birrell seems to be entirely unaware of the advantages of this
for the smaller countries, such as Denmark or potentially Scotland.
All countries in the modern world accept limitations on their
independence through their membership of international organisations
such as the United Nations or the European Union. These organisations
impose restraints on the larger powers, but they enhance the influence
of the smaller countries.
This is especially true of the European Union where the voting system
is designed to give a disproportionate weight to them. and it is why Mr
Major tried and failed to change the rules at the last expansion of
membership.
Ministers of the smaller countries frequently comment on the way in
which membership has increased and not diminished their influence. The
sooner Scotland becomes a member in our own right the better.
George Birrell's wallowing in nostalgia would be picturesque and funny
if it were not so pernicious. This old fogey tendency is an obstacle to
the emancipation and progress of Scotland.
Usually the victims of the tendency are sensible enough to keep their
prejudices to themselves. Perhaps Birrell is performing a public service
by speaking out and revealing the real absurdity of unionist reaction.

THE veracity of the statements being issued by the Dounreay press
office must surely be called into question. Last week's statement that
the high active waste shaft contains only rainwater must rank with the
flights of fancy of Dr Goebbels.
Dounreay has an unlined shaft driven through layers of multi-fissured
Caithness flagstone rock, sited a few yards back from the high-water
line, and taken down to a level well below that of low-water spring
tides.
If the ''rainwater'' within this shaft does not rise and fall with the
tide, then Dounreay has a natural phenomenon to match that of the
milk-consuming Hindu gods.
What the Dounreay shaft will contain is groundwater, which if it can
enter the shaft, can just as assuredly leave again.
A further thought for the Dounreay press office. If the shaft has been
the recipient of rainwater for the past 40 years, why does it never
overflow, or require to be pumped out?
While the perpetrators of this ecological error are not doubt dead and
gone, a number of the operators are still around. If after all this time
the management of this establishment are still unwilling to face the
magnitude of their problem, then the time has indeed come for a public
inquiry.
If freed from the constraints of the Official Secrets Act I am more
than willing to contribute my pennyworth.

IT WAS a delight to read Michael Fry's excellent and thoroughly
common-sense article on nuclear energy (October 4). Without doubt you
will now receive an avalanche of indignant and outraged correspondence
from the vast and variegated battalions of assorted greenies and
flat-earthers horrified that his sensible arguments may be effective in
slowing the forward march to windmills and ducks.
Michael Fry's comparison with the invention of the internal combustion
engine is entirely apposite, and one hesitates to reflect on the current
state of human progress if the ecology psychosis had been as virulent
then as it is now.
Nuclear physics is as necessary a step in human progress as were man's
first hesitant steps out of the caves.
Neither is it the last step because it prepares the way for future
generations yet unborn to make new discoveries in the fields of matter
and anti-matter and other areas of technical and scientific development
as unknown and unimagined to us as were the wheel and the steam engine
to generations past.
Similarly Michael Fry's sensible reflections on the safety aspects of
nuclear power generation are entirely appropriate and one wonders for
example if there had been an environmentalist lobby at the beginning of
this century whether they would have succeeded in imposing a worldwide
ban on the construction of steamships after the foundering of the
Titanic.
Had they done so it would without doubt have been on the basis of
damage to icebergs rather than the loss of human life.
Were I like Michael Fry a Scottish Tory I would certainly be making
every effort to ensure that the party did all in its power to claim
credit for technological progress.
My own party, the SNP, having it seems learned nothing from the
electoral catastrophes that followed upon the direct action at Calton
Hill in the early 1980s, is apparently preparing to snatch defeat from
the jaws of victory by organising a campaign of civil disobedience
against the developments at Dounreay.

I WAS delighted to read George Birrell's article on the ''English
problem'' (September 30). I am a retired medical officer of health. I
graduated in 1927 and after three years working at Yorkhill and
Rottenrow Maternity Hospital decided to take up preventive medicine.
I could not get a post in Glasgow but received one in an East End
London borough near the docks, starting in February 1931. I happily
worked there until 1967. I never had anything but kindness,
co-operation, and friendliness from schools, clinics, and colleagues all
that time and I never found my Scottish accent anything but a passport
into English goodwill.
My admiration for my London neighbours who endured with me the Blitz,
the flying bombs and the rockets is still undimmed.
I had many English friends and although their ranks have thinned now
their children and grandchildren still keep in touch.
Devolution yes, but no to independence.

SELDOM have I been moved to anger by anything in The Herald as I am by
George Hume's appallingly insensitive article (Frosty reception for
darker times, October 2).
Ask any of the hundreds of thousands of Scots -- and I am one of them
-- whose lives have been, for a short time or longer, blighted by
depression -- and it is very common. Ask anyone whose life has been
touched by it, through a family member, or someone else close.
Is depression whimsical? Is it something to write tongue-in-cheek
articles about?
The biggest problem about depression is that anyone who hasn't already
first-hand knowledge of it, hasn't a clue what the sufferer is going
through. This includes, particularly, employers.
We are amongst the very few people who appear perfectly normal when,
in the worst cases, the sufferer may be on the verge of suicide (in
which position, thankfully, I have never been).
Those who are afflicted by it (and it is a well-documented and very
real illness, whose victims have included Winston Churchill), will not
be cheered by this whimsical piece. It is especially disappointing,
coming from such a respected journalist.
I suggest George Hume reads Janice Galloway's fine novel, The Trick is
to Keep Breathing, before he touches his word-processor on this painful
subject again.

AS was widely expected the medical faculty at Dundee University
refused to re-admit Brian MacKinnon as a student. Now that the whole
story is known, it seems a harsh -- and to this layman's eyes at least
-- a very unjust decision.
No-one denies there was subterfuge (and whether or not medics should
be capable of such ingenuity must remain a moot point). But might it not
be that the real culprit in this whole sad affair is the hidebound
attitude of the medical schools toward students who go down with
anything that is characterised as ''psychiatric'' -- even when, as in
this case, it was evidently the wrong diagnosis?
The young man feared that to be labelled ''obessional'' by the
university psychiatrist would pretty well seal his fate as far as a
career in medicine went. Sadly this proved to be only too true.
A person could easily run away with the idea that medical faculties up
and down the country are as prejudiced on this subject as only poor
ignorant laymen are supposed to be.
It is certainly to be hoped that this is not the case. But of course
here we are dealing with doctors not as healers but as administrative
officials, heads of faculties, etc. One supposes they can be as
prejudiced as anybody else in that capacity.
Surely in the city of R D Laing there should be no question of turning
a brush with psychiatry into a lifelong handicap. We have a right to
expect better than that from our universities.

HOW refreshing to read George Birrell (September 30) in connection
with our attitude as Scots to our neighbour and partner in the United
Kingdom, England. It was a welcome change from the fulminations so often
repeated by devolutionist Brian Wilson, nationalist Alex Salmond, and
pseudo-nationalists Murray Ritchie and Ruth Wishart.
As one who has travelled extensively in England on business and also
since entering the Christian ministry on ''the King's business'', I want
to pay tribute to the warm welcome and appreciation shown by customers
and friends south of the Border.
The partisanship and venom sometimes displayed by my compatriots to
the English has deeply embarrassed me, and I deplore any encouragement
given to the extremists among the nationalists. We have only to see what
extreme nationalism has led to in other parts of the world, with the
former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, to give examples, still before our eyes.

THE Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum is an independent organisation
dedicated to stimulating debate and promoting good practice in urban
regeneration. I was therefore pleased to see so much space devoted to
Jennifer Cunningham's article on the work of the Wester Hailes
Partnership (October 2).
I was disappointed, however, that she did not take the opportunity to
look at the Scottish Office proposals for Programme for Partnership
which will extend the partnership approach it has adopted in the four
urban partnerships (Wester Hailes, Castlemilk, Ferguslie Park, and
Whitfield) to a larger number of areas.
Under the proposals the new single-tier local authorities have been
encouraged to co-ordinate council area wide regeneration strategies in
partnership with Scottish Homes, the local enterprise companies, and
other public, private, voluntary, and community organisations.
These strategies will include proposals for a lmited number of new or
enhanced area-based initiatives to be know as Priority Partnership
Areas, which will have priority for urban programme funding. Work on the
strategies is well under way.
If the new councils and their partners are to rise to the challenges
posed by Programme for Parnership there needs to be a continuing debate
in Scotland that will enable the identification of good practice and the
promotion of innovation. It is to be hoped The Herald will give this
issue the prominence it deserves.

RECENTLY, in one of those conversations which peer tentatively over
the edge and into the mists ahead, I asked a senior Scottish banker to
predict how many high street branches he or his successors will be
operating in 20 years' time.
''I simply don't know,'' came the hands-up, drop-dead, honest reply.
''It will either be roughly as many as we have now,'' -- several
hundred, in his case -- ''or no more than 10,'' he added, after a
reflective pause. We then fell to speculating recklessly about whether
there will even be a need for banks as we know them in 2015.
What, after all, do most of us use banks for? If we are working, they
are the recipients of our salary cheques and the means, through standing
orders and direct debits, of making regular payments. If we are in funds
they are a source of ready cash. If we need to borrow, they will provide
that too, at a price.
But the advent of plastic credit and charge cards, hole-in-the-wall
cash dispensers, telephone banking channels, and innovations yet to be
dreamed of all raise bigger and bigger question marks over whether these
services need, any longer, be located in multiple physical presences on
high streets across the land.
Not only are banks as networks of bricks-and-mortar branches in
question. The core services they offer are under growing competitive
threat from rivals. ''There are dozens of other sources of readily
available competitive credit,'' my banking friend conceded. ''Walk down
any high street.''
And the day may not be that far away when it will be possible to get
paid and pay your bills through a combination of personal smart cards
and secure home-based computer networks, without the help of any bank as
intermediary.
Much will depend on how far future generations are willing to
substitute the telephone and the computer screen for old-fashioned human
contact and social interaction. Much will depend on how far society
allows the virtual to become our dominant reality.
I reflected on that conversation and the thoughts it triggered as I
listened on Tuesday to Tony Blair's vision of a young Britain,
enthusiastically taking the computer and communication revolutions to
its heart, rebuilding the tattered fabric of the nation by adding mile
after mile to the information superhighway, accessed by laptops by the
million, available to every schoolchild in the land.
I've written elsewhere of the profound impact the Labour leader's
intensely moral critique of sclerotic old Britain had on me and, I
suspect, almost everyone who heard it. But I found the way Blair chose
to embrace a silicon-and-fibre future surprisingly superficial and
touchingly naive. The weakest part of an otherwise remarkable
performance.
The anorak has no place in the wardrobe of colour co-ordinated
designer-suited new Labour. But there was, shall we say, a virtual
anorak lurking around the Brighton platform when Blair began to wax
lyrical about the power of technology to change all our lives for ever.
Many have likened these passages in Blair's speech to the
white-heat-of-technology series of speeches made by Harold Wilson in the
run-up to the 1964 General Election. I was in the hall when Wilson made
one of them. I still have the collected version, in a Penguin paperback,
somewhere on my shelves.
And, while I can still vividly remember the sheer intellectual
excitement of Wilson's vision, the promise of a ''third way'' to growth
involving neither devaluation nor deflation, I remember just as sharply,
the subsequent disappointments.
The aluminium smelter at Invergordon which came and went, a lesson --
like Linwood, Bathgate, Fort William, and Ravenscraig -- in the
long-term futility of bribing industry to go where it doesn't want to
go. The scrapping of TSR2. The Ministry of Technology, Industrial
Reorganisation Corporation, National Enterprise Board, planning
agreements, and all the other Whitehall paraphernalia which, while it
boosted productivity for a time, failed to halt the inexorable decline
of Britain as a major competitive industrial power.
Despite the white heat Wilson conjured up in words in the 1960s,
Britain entered the 1990s with virtually no indigenous presence in
modern technology after modern technology. We even sold out on older
technologies, like car production. And learned to live instead from the
offshore investment decisions of others.
Of course Tony Blair is seeking power in a quite different social and
industrial context from that which confronted Harold Wilson. Much of
that statist baggage of the 1960s and 1970s is no longer the subject of
serious political debate, other than on the pages of Labour Briefing.
But the lesson that, for political leaders with radical agendas, the gap
between aspiration and achievement can prove a dauntingly large one
remains inescapable.
I welcome any creative attempts to wire schools and colleges into the
proliferating global databases. I cheer on efforts to put more computers
in schools. But the mere existence of electronic boxes on desks and
cables under every playground will change nothing. What is needed is the
skill and flair to exploit these tools in ways which will add to this
country's competitive advantage in the years ahead.
There is nothing virtual about that reality. But it's one we've dodged
as a nation for far too long. It comes down to a fundamental
reassessment of what this country invests in education and training,
particularly at the earlier stages.
It's not just about how big the education budget is. It's about the
whole culture within which that money is spent, a culture which still
fails to liberate, in sufficient numbers, the kind of inquiring,
inventive minds which will take the raw material of a silicon-and-fibre
infrastructure and turn it into the growth industries of tomorrow.
On the Budget issue Tony Blair is largely silent. If he can do deals
with the private sector, like the understanding with BT, he'll trumpet
them from any platform. But if it means confronting the British people
with the need to put more in to get more back, Labour remains trapped by
the fear of being branded, once more, the tax-and-spend alternative.
There are, he warned us, no blank cheques.
On generating cultural change in an education system wired up for
action, the new model Labour Party has a lot more thinking to do. And
little time left in which to do it.

BEING a frequent commuter on ScotRail I was initially pleased to read
about the upgrading of Glasgow Central Station, particularly relating to
the installation of disabled toilets.
However, such improvements are superficial when one realises that, due
to the non-existence of lifts, the lower level of Central Station is
inaccessible to non-ambulant commuters.
By all means improve amenities but stop putting the cart before the
horse and direct funding towards the installation of lifts and thus make
the station fully accessible to all passengers, actual and potential.

CANON Kenyon Wright is better at applying soothing balm than most, but
his emollient skills may be sorely tried in the tussle over the number
of seats in the proposed Scottish parliament. The emergence of the issue
is not entirely surprising despite the belief of the principals that it
had all been settled. Mr George Robertson and Mr Jim Wallace cut a deal
between them which settled on a parliament of 129 members. This was a
compromise, and a surprising one given that Labour had initially wanted
only 113 members, the Liberal Democrats had wanted at least 30 more, and
the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the bad boys and girls in the
current scenario, had argued for a 200-seat parliament. The problem with
deals crafted behind closed doors is that, while satisfactory to the
principals, they rarely involve proper consultation and are liable
seriously to annoy lesser parties who, it is assumed, can be dragged
along on the day. This is always a large assumption and seldom
justified.
The Liberal Democrat leadership was the first to feel some
hot-breathed opposition when the party's leader on Lothian and Edinburgh
councils, Mr Donald Gorie, expressed his unhappiness, believing the new
system to be not properly proportional and failing in equal
representation of men and women. No doubt in the interests of party
unity, the Liberal Democrats have sanctioned the agreement and so has
Labour's Scottish executive. The matter might have rested there if it
had not been for the doggedness of Mr Campbell Christie and other
members of the STUC. By refusing to support the deal Mr Christie and his
colleagues have caused a serious problem. Whether the root of their
opposition is worth the fuss is by no means clear. The STUC believes
that the present plan is unacceptable because it does not address the
question of equal representation of men or women or reflect the
diversity of Scotland's communities. The issue of equal-gender
representation is not a new one in politics. The Labour Party's plans to
insist on women candidates in a number of electoral seats appears to
have disintegrated, and rightly so, for the simple reason that the
quality of candidate is more important than their gender. Labour has
already taken steps to promote women in politics and, thankfully, women
in Labour have done an even better job of promoting themselves. In the
case of a Scottish parliament, there is no guarantee that a 200-seat
formula would draw in more women unless the discredited system of
positive discrimination were applied.
It is difficult to agree with the STUC's anxiety over representation
of diverse groups such as the churches, tenants associations, trade
unions, and the like. All could be, and are, represented in the existing
political parties and, as in the case of gender, there is no reason to
suppose that a 200-seat parliament would represent them any better. Mr
Christie has been a notable fighter for a Scottish parliament in the
past; his commitment to that cause is not in doubt, but by arguing for
an unwieldy parliament and by bringing the process to a halt so near to
completion, he is risking the enterprise for which he has worked so
hard. Canon Kenyon Wright will argue that the concerns of the STUC are
being met in the present agreement. This seems likely to us, but whether
it is acceptable to all or not, the danger facing the Scottish
Constitutional Convention is that the work of years could be ruined by
these last-minute objections. Mr Christie and the STUC will have to
weight their actions in future days with the utmost care.

THE end of the Cold War has brought all sorts of problems which have
complicated the simple assumptions of a straightforward peace dividend.
It has not proved to be possible to make swingeing cuts in defence
capacity which match exactly cuts in defence costs. Cuts in capacity
yield smaller benefits than might have been expected and an economic
procurement policy runs into difficulties when it comes up against the
notion that some economies may be false when their achievement is at the
cost of maintaining a strategic capacity with the UK itself. Thus, when
the MoD decided to favour a Westland transport helicopter model rather
than a cheaper foreign rival, the very much higher cost to the taxpayers
was defended by reference to the strategic attractions of maintaining a
domestic manufacturing capacity in such a significant area. Now the
Ministry has awarded a large contract for artillery shells to an Israeli
company, after an auction designed to identify the cheapest producer. It
must seem that a domestic capacity to provide shells is almost as
important a requirement as that to turn out highly sophisticated
equipment like helicopters. There seems to be little consistency in
procurement policy, though there is great secrecy in providing detailed
information about the latest contract, something the Israelis
fortunately do not share.
In fact the whole area is complicated by the way in which every deal
is affected by others contingent upon it. Thus an obvious, but extremely
expensive, military need is for ambulances, and the Army needs to place
a large replacement order. Should it buy a very expensive Austrian
vehicle, whose cost derives in large measure from extremely high
standards well over and above those demanded by the Army? If it fails to
do it, compensating orders for #30m of British-made equipment will be
lost. On the other hand, the much cheaper competitor is from Land Rover
and its rejection is thought likely to cost the parent company as much
as #100m in lost export orders. Juggling with such considerations makes
defence procurement more than a matter of military calculation.
Something similar was seen in a related field at the Labour Party
conference yesterday when the delegates, to the leadership's delight,
voted to maintain Trident, the nuclear weapons delivery system which
gives the Royal Navy its expensive deterrent. The arguments about
Trident (which has mostly been paid for) are no longer mainly financial.
Previously Labour had been vulnerable on this aspect of defence where it
was out of step with majority opinion. It is now in line, showing, as Mr
Blair put it, ''a new maturity''. That may be so, but the fact is that
Trident is not a cheap system to maintain and the real argument should
have been about whether it was still necessary in a changed world to
deploy it. This aspect of its retention was touched on only incidentally
when delegates were reminded of the dangerous real world. It is also a
changed world and whether its dangers are of the sort to require a
deterrent of this sort is still a matter of considerable debate. The
scope for argument here is great, and Labour was certainly heavily
penalised for its confused nuclear policies in the past. But the point
is that there is no peace dividend in keeping Trident, and the reasons
for retaining it, whether argued by Labour or by the Tories, could do
with more illumination.

''FOURTEEN words about Scotland,'' sneered Salmond. ''Five words about
Scotland,'' out-bid Forsyth. What a well-matched pair, and how
satisfactory that they could find nothing worse to moan about following
Tony Blair's speech to the Labour Party conference.
A National Minimum Wage, you understand, has nothing to do with
Scotland because it doesn't have Scottish in the title. Never mind the
fact that it was in Bishopbriggs that Burger King were actually caught
red-handed; and that our sturdy naive entrepreneurs include some of the
lowest payers in Britain.
The National Health Service isn't about Scotland because it's not the
SNHS. Tell that to the patients, nurses and ancillary workers who value
Labour's greatest invention and fear for its future unless the people
who believe in it are soon running it once again.
Overseas aid isn't our moral responsibility, since Scotland isn't
overseas. The extraordinary deal announced with British Telecom isn't of
any relevance to our future because it isn't Scottish Telecom. And so
absurdly on.
The truth is, of course, almost every word of Tony Blair's speech was
both directly relevant to Scotland and warmed the hearts of a
substantial majority of Scots; though not, understandably, the two
pathetic word-counters.
In over 20 years of attending Labour Party conferences, I have
certainly never heard a better speech or sensed more unity and
self-confidence in the hall.
During the dark days of the early eighties, I started applying a test
to what was going on. Emerging from the conference hall each day into
the paths of normal people having a good time in Blackpool or Brighton,
the question which I asked was: Would you want them to have seen what
has just been going on there?
All too often, the answer was resoundingly negative. It was a party
which, by becoming a prisoner of zealots and minorities, had become
divorced from the mass of the people which it should have existed to
represent.
The only people who benefited from the shambles were our political
opponents; principally the Tories, who had an easy ride for a decade
despite their own unpopularity and because of Labour's failure to offer
a credible alternative.
Fortunately, nobody else was capable of filling the vacuum during that
period, so that Labour was spared the fate which befell the Liberals in
the early years of the century. We were given the grace of time, to get
our act together again and become a party worthy of holding office.
It has been a long and painful haul. But there certainly wasn't anyone
in Brighton this week, friend or foe, Scottish or English, media or
delegate, who dissented from the fact that this position has now been
reached. And it is on the basis of as exciting, radical and deliverable
an agenda as any in British political history.
There is still, of course, the potential to pluck defeat from the jaws
of victory in some outposts of eighties. But as the response to Arthur
Scargill's attempts to re-open the Clause 4 debate revealed, they are
few and far between.
This was a week which inspired and motivated afresh the Labour Party.
I have no doubt that the same kind of responses will have spilled over
into the country, on a very substantial scale, in Scotland as much as
anywhere else. People who want a change of government and share the
values spelt out by Tony Blair know that only Labour can deliver.
As far as I am aware, the pubs and streets are not alive to debates
about the relative merits of a 129 or 145-member Scottish Parliament. It
is a detail rather than a principle. Equally, tartan word-counts, based
on the premise that what's good for the rest of Britain cannot possibly
be about Scotland also, impress only the fools who conduct them.
But what is yearned for is a change of Government which will deliver
all the great reforms promised by Tony Blair on Tuesday -- including the
constitutional ones.
Scotland could be mentioned a hundred times in John Major's speech
next week, and it would not undo one iota of the damage from the past 16
years. It would not put one extra youngster into work. That is the point
which the Scottish people can easily understand, even if Labour's
opponents prefer to ignore it.

MOLLIE Harris is dead and Martha Woodford, my dear, I hardly knew ye.
When does middle age begin these days? For women there are fewer and
fewer visible clues as its chronological frontier -- 40, perhaps? --
recedes before toning tables, collegen injections, and replaced
hormones, but there are other tell-tale signs.
My own first steps up the crumbling molehill of middle age started
with three small changes of habit: I began feeling reluctant to answer
the phone after nine o'clock at night, I began asking the names of
shrubs and alpines in friends' gardens, and I began listening to The
Archers.
Again. I began listening to The Archers again, after three decades of
neglect. Children of the wireless generation followed The Archers
because their appetite for long-running serial drama wasn't recognised
and wasn't catered for by Children's Hour. The crucial interest, for
pubescent girls, was its love stories: Christine Archer and Paul
Johnson, John Tregorran and Carol Grey, Philip Archer and Grace
Fairbrother. They were the Scotts and Charleens de nos jours.
Attention faltered as we entered our teens, encountered television,
and heard the siren songs from wilder shores, the subversive new music
coming out of distant radio stations in Memphis, Tennessee. Ambridge
began to sound antique, Borchester boring. I stopped listening some time
after Grace died in that hideous stable fire -- timed to coincide with
the launch of a second television channel and the commercial network --
and for more than 30 years I never missed The Archers.
It was creepy, meeting them again. Like Rip Van Winkle I felt much the
same but everyone else had changed. Some, including Dan and Doris, had
died; Doris quietly in her armchair in 1980 and Dan six years later, his
heart giving out when he went to rescue a sheep.
Their alcoholic son Jack was also dead and the steady Phil was now
Brookside's patriarch, married to virtuous Jill and father of four
grown-up children. The Gabriel line was preserved in old Walter's shady
son Nelson, mine host of Borchester's first wine bar, and Jack's widow
Peggy had handed over the tenancy of The Bull to a couple called Perks.
Not only were there two new generations of Archers but Ambridge was
full of strangers -- Jack Woolley at Gray Gables, the Pargetters at
Lower Loxley, the comic yokels Grundy, the Carters and Tuckers, the
sympathetic Caroline Bone and the ridiculous white settler Lynda Snell.
Getting to know them took some perseverance, but my domestic routine
usually found me in the kitchen at five minutes past seven, cooking to
the radio. Even so, it was years before I got Jennifer Aldridge's
many-fathered children sorted out.
As for Martha Woodford -- the good-hearted, gossipy village shopkeeper
and willing babysitter to Sharon's Kylie (I enjoyed the reference to the
Australian soap starlet) was on her way into the background of Ambridge
life by the time I caught up with her. Mollie Harris, one of the few
authentic countryfolk in the cast, joined the series in 1970 and was the
author of some of its most successful spin-off publications, including
The Archer Cookbook. But who was Martha's one-time dancing partner
Colonel Danby?
Mysteries remained, puzzles persisted. I connected with the everyday
story of increasingly worldly countryfolk like someone who had lost a
memory bank of brain cells in one of their regular car crashes. Whatever
happened to Paul Johnson? Who is George Barford, the homely old
gamekeeper who is now married to Christine Archer, one-time role model
for the pony club set? Did John Tregorran ever win the hand of Carol
Grey, and where are they now? They went the way of social change.
The greatest strength of The Archers, the quality which has caused it
to endure far beyond the lifespan of other famous radio soaps like Mrs
Dale's Diary, has not been its handle on rural nostalgia but its fix on
the contemporary compass. Those urgent romances which engaged my
pre-teen years, the happy-ever-afters for John and Carol and Paul and
Christine turned into marriages strained by the clamorous individualism
of the seventies and eighties; that, at least, was their fate as written
between the lines of the paperback edition of The Book of the Archers
(Michael Joseph: #9.99).
Published this week, this is the work which recovers the missing years
for people like me. It's an alphabetical catalogue of biographies of
everyone who has ever had regular lines in the series and the three who
don't. (Pub quiz question: which three well-known residents of Ambridge
have never been heard to speak? Answer: Prue Forrest, Freda Fry, and
Edward Grundy, the younger sprog of Eddie and Clarrie.) Fittingly, its
data was harvested from the archives by three leading members of the
cast, Patricia Greene (Jill Archer), Charles Collingwood (Brian
Aldridge) and Hedli Niklaus (Kathy Perks).
Here I learn that in 1961 Chris's first husband embarked on a series
of business ventures and ''behind Christine's back he also sought
satisfaction of another kind''. In 1966 they adopted a son, Peter, in
the hope of building a happy family life together ''but by 1974 Paul was
in Germany trying to expand his business concerns''. Fruitlessly. By
1978 he had filed for bankruptcy and in the same year he was killed in a
car crash on the autobahn. A year later Chris made her improbable match
with Jack Woolley's gamekeeper.
John Tregorran finally married Carol Grey, the widow Grenville, in
1967, and they had two children, but in the seventies they picked up
seventies habits. Carol did some menopausal shoplifting and John had an
affair with the wayward Jennifer Aldridge. The Me Generation had arrived
in Ambridge but the Tregorrans hung together, resumed village life and
in 1990 moved to Bristol.
All my questions answered. I feel quietly satisfied, as if I'd finally
managed to chew off the ragnails hanging from a significant social
chronicle. Is this sad?

Despite escaping life on the streets, author Evelyn Lau finds threads
from her past still tugging hard, as Ann Donald describes.
AT the tail end of my interview with one of Canada's youngest and most
prestigious authors, 24-year-old Evelyn Lau makes what is a rather
astonishing admission for an award-winning poet and author of some three
volumes of poetry, two of fiction, and one best-selling diary.
''I have no imagination whatsoever,'' she says, almost nonchalantly.
''When I was a child I had a really good imagination and lived in a
fantasy world but now I've lost it.''
What happened? ''Life happened,'' she laughs, as she does often and
garrulously throughout our conversation. ''I was so crushed by the
weight of life as a teenager on the streets. It was so brutal, sudden,
and overwhelming . . . a very rude awakening. Ever since then I've never
been able to imagine anything . . . I see this as a problem.''
Coming from most people, this declaration may smack of excessive
melodrama or the exaggerations of a precocious young talent. This is not
so with Lau.
After running away from a troubled homelife, she lived on Vancouver's
streets as a prostitute from the ages of 14 to 16. Though drugs helped
haze the grossness of the situation, Lau's writer's instinct held strong
and she later transformed diary entries from this period of her life
into the best-selling Runaway: Diary Of A Street Kid.
Despite Lau's understandable desire to shed this sensationalist
''ex-prostitute turned writer'' tag and assert her deserved literary
credibility, threads from that period seven years ago and her family
background seem persistently to tug hard at both her work and personal
lives.
I suggest to Lau, who is here to participate in the Castlemilk Writers
Festival and promote her first novel, Other Women, that this latest,
very sensual and emotionally intimate work appears to be diametrically
opposed to her previous collection of short stories, Fresh Girls, which
was a clinically dispassionate yet poetic analysis of prostitutes
specialising in sado-masochism.
''Even though I've written so graphically in the past,'' she says, ''I
felt a lot more vulnerable with this book because with the main
character, Fiona, you see into her heart. I wanted to explore the
feelings more than gymnastics,'' she smiles and continues to sip from
the glass of mineral water.
Like the bulk of her prose, Other Women resonates with certain
autobiographical strains -- ''I did have very strong feelings for
someone who was married'' -- and is a beautifully evocative account of a
young woman's doomed first love and obsessional affair with a married
man. Already compared to Marguerita Duras' A Lover, it is marked by an
absence of sexual content but still carries Lau's signature theme of
''the other woman as an outsider'' to what she appears to view as the
mysterious but powerful institution of marriage.
''I've always written from the outside,'' she says with candour,
''with my face pressed against the glass, hoping one day to be on the
inside. I've always worried whether it is something I could ever do --
be married.''
She confesses, with a certain childlike yet detached curiosity, to
being fascinated by the concept of marriage. ''If I never had that
experience of marriage I'd feel that I'd missed out on something I could
have learned a lot from''. Yet she later wonders aloud whether her
expectations of it could have been skewed permanently by such
conflicting formative influences as the horrendous example of her
parents' marriage or her voracious juvenile consumption of Harlequin
romance novels.
Of her parents' marriage, she alarmingly echos Philip Larkin's
sentiments about the reverberations of our mums' and dads' experiences
on the child. ''I can't imagine being in a relationship that didn't have
some component of cruelty or humiliation,'' she notes matter-of-factly.
''In Fresh Girls I took it to an extreme but it can be an emotional
cruelty as much as physical, can't it? One isn't doomed to repeat the
behaviour of one's parents, but I don't know whether I know how to have
a relationship any other way.''
At times she seems to be working out this private train of thought
aloud, with the interviewer slipping into role of silent voyeur, but
then she'll punctuate the thought with a dash of realistic cynicism:
''But how many people do have warm, loving relationships?''
Since running away from home, Lau has not seen either her parents or
younger sister though the family still lives in Vancouver.
''My parents have no concept of what I do. I don't talk to them. I
sometimes wonder if I would recognise my little sister on the street,
but then I don't know if I'd like that because I can imagine what she's
been told about me.''
Despite the fact that Lau's literary fiction appears to be
progressively losing the autobiographical content that haunted Runaway
and Fresh Girls, it would seem that her family history and the two years
on Vancouver's streets are harder to cast from her personal baggage.

YOU can always rely on the good old gala concert. It will be bitty and
it will overrun. Nobody knew this last one better than Bolshoi boss
Alexander Lazarev, who last night ushered his singers on and off stage
like a traffic cop, often starting the music while they were threading
their way through the orchestra.
The occasion was the fifth anniversary concert of the Royal Concert
Hall, with the Royal SNO in accompanying mode (bet they loved that) most
of the night under the dynamic direction of Lazarev with the RSNO Chorus
and a squad of singers from the Bolshoi Opera. Just exactly who was
singing what required a little guesswork as the programme didn't
associate names with musical numbers. Lazarev forgot his glasses and
left burly, bearded, bass Vladimir Matorin standing onstage like a spare
end. Oh yes, very smoothly it all went.
For an opener, Tommy Fowler's effervescent new Fanfare, beginning with
the brass high in the gallery, then rolling along, with musical
incidents passing at high speed, rather like fast-passing scenic
impressions seen from the window of a high-speed train.
Then: first half, Russian opera, second half Italian. Paradoxically,
the Italian extracts -- great numbers from Rigoletto and Trovatore --
fared better than Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov. The primary interest
was in the voices themselves. The distinctive character of Russian
operatic voices was on display last night. They are bullet-proof and
carved from granite. These singers just stand there, open their mouths,
and out pours molten sound. The soprano and baritone, respectively
brilliant and burnished, sang with the intensity of a laser.
The coloratura soprano, Elena Bryliova, in the extraordinary, wordless
concerto for voice and orchestra by Gliere had a small and delicate
voice, but one capable of soaring to staggering heights. A colourful
evening, though amounting to less than the sum of its parts.

AFTER its success at this year's Fringe, Swansea-based Frantic Theatre
Company has brought Klub back to Scotland as part of the International
Festival of University Theatre. Klub is a high-energy trip into the
sexy, sweaty world of club culture. Six young men and women using a
mixture of dance, mime, dialogue and the raw energy of their bodies
recreate the fragmented world of a jilted generation. We are shown an
alienated youth who has grown up in an era where the sterility of the
mobile phone and the answering machine have supplanted one-to-one
communication.
Played out on a smoke-filled stage that is steeped in the sounds of
techno and technology and illuminated with spotlights and flashes of
colour, Klub exposes the emptiness at the core of the ''me'' generation.
Snippets of personal histories fight to be heard and words of desire are
replaced by the lyrics of a pop song echoing from a tinny tape recorder.
We are shown snapshots of a world inhabited by bingeing anorexics,
single mothers, and frustrated TV starlets, a world where the yuppie and
the unemployed collide, a world ultimately bereft of hope. Using a
soundscape devised in collaboration with Hacienda DJ Andy Cleeton and
the taut physicality of Stephen Kirkham's choreography, Frantic has
created an energetic and impressionistic performance that is
exhilarating to watch. Perfectly paced for an audience brought up on a
diet of MTV, Klub's message seems to be that the youth culture of the
1990s has created a generation that feels, as one character put it,
''disheartened, disillusioned and disowned''.
Generation X has given way to generation why.

THEATRE of the Absurd takes on a whole new dimension when it is
performed in a language which is completely beyond your comprehension.
You have seriously to question the sanity of an existence that finds you
sitting in a darkened auditorium listening to a relentless torrent of
Greek, when your grasp of the language doesn't stretch beyond dolmades,
tsatsiki, and taramosalata.
The Cantharos Group, the Greek component of the International Festival
of University Theatre (IFUT) currently taking place all over Glasgow,
specialise in performing the work of Paris Tacopoulos, a playwright
whose style is heavily word-based. Much in the vein of Ionesco, the four
short plays presented here rely on absurd dialogue and nonsensical logic
to point up the shakiness of ''reality'', and the cruelty and
ridiculousness that prop up ''civilised'' society (I think).
The prefacing of each piece with a synopsis in English was not really
sufficient to communicate a sense of the plays to a non-Greek speaker
like myself, serving only to destroy any suspense. Minimal staging and
largely static performances also did little to fill out the theatrical
experience.
But then, who said that IFUT's ''cultural exchange'' had to cater for
mono-lingual Glaswegians? The city's Greek community, who had turned up
in force, had the rare chance to see the work of one of their country's
leading contemporary playwrights performed in their mother tongue. The
student company, despite major technical hiccups in the final piece,
pulled off the over-blown performance style demanded with slick
confidence. Those among the audience who understood it obviously got the
joke . . . and I enjoyed the cheesy interlude music.

INTENDED as a piece of musical entertainment rather than an act of
religious worship, Handel's oratorio Israel In Egypt served its basic
purpose in last night's performance directed by John Currie. Singers
were extracted from his own John Currie Singers while the mighty chorus
appeared under the name of The Scottish Chorus; basically a collection
of singers who have sung under Currie's baton from the eighties to the
present day.
Essentially a choral epic, Currie was fortunate in the calibre of his
assembled masses. They know how to deliver both Handel's mighty outcries
and his contemplative utterancies, contrasting exciting interpretations
of the many plagues, the barren and evocative He sent a thick darkness
over all the land making the greatest emotional impact. Fugal passages
would have benefited from slightly more attention to detail but Currie's
steady tempos made sure that textures remained essentially clear.
Of the soloists, tenor Mark Wilde stood streets ahead of the rest. A
mature and assured voice, he projected his recitatives and the
second-half aria The enemy said with a sure sense of Handelian phrasing,
buoyant yet always with utter grace. Baritones George Gordon and Stewart
Kempster though well balanced in their duet, appeared to be lacking in
self confidence, a trait also found in mezzo-soprano Barbara Brodie --
the voices are there, if only they could be brought to their full
potential.
Led by Clive Thomas, Currie's orchestra provided a solid if a little
stodgy accompaniment, strings and woodwind suffering under some dodgy
intonation. On the whole then, an entertaining performance in many parts
but not quite coming together as a whole.

IT'S been an intriguing year for obscure Noel Cowards. A couple of
months ago the first revival in decades of his patriotic epic Cavalcade
did the rounds and now director Giles Havergal has dug out the
playwright's last full-length piece, a fascinating swan song that
reveals rare depths beneath the glittering surface.
What's surprising, at nearly 30 years old, is just how well it stands
up as a modern-day gay play. This neat drama, making little attempt to
hide its autobiographical content, is about a respected author who is
confronted by his own homosexuality.
As is often the way, the revelation is a shock to no-one but himself,
and Coward's real concern is with how his one extended act of secrecy
has eaten away like a cancer, killing in him all emotional relationships
and true feelings.
If early Coward plays are like shimmering dreams, this is Coward as
nightmare. The witty one-liners no longer giving way to indifferent
posturing but, particularly in the intimacy of the Circle Studio, to
real vulnerability.
Having his shell gradually cracked is a white-haired Robert David
MacDonald whose undemonstrative, almost mumbling delivery is underscored
by a lifetime's neurosis. Ellen Sheean as his German wife, at once
innocent and all-knowing, finds both comedy and pathos in her
character's straightforwardness. And Roberta Taylor, as his former
girlfriend, dances around her own uncertain motivations with
considerable cunning.
There's the odd moment when it seems too blatantly the playwright's
cross-examination of himself but, complete with a storyline involving
the premature death of a male lover, it is a sharp insight that could
have been tailor-made for today.

WE are warned, courteously, at the start about the alarm bells.
Buzzer, bell, and siren, will all be a part of the action -- we are not
to be alarmed in earnest. The real, mind-splitting klaxon alarms come at
us more subtly. In quiet voices, and with a laid-back style of
presentation, the thorniest issues make their way centre stage: what
exactly is personal freedom, who -- or what -- controls the currency of
our lives, where ultimately does the responsibility for society lie . .
. with the individual or with the Gods, who have all the advantages.
Gods? Indeed, yes.
One of the most refreshing, rewarding elements of a desperate
optimists event is the breadth and depth of their informed perceptions.
Seated behind a cluttered laboratory table they approach subjects of
mythic proportions through original myths and modern talismen, and they
criss-crossed unselfconsciously between them. They are in regular,
direct communication with us explaining, from time to time, the scenario
as it progresses. They do this with good humoured ordinariness -- the
alarms are as strident as they get. To serve the purpose of time, they
appear as an undercover cell of political activists who mail out
communiques to choice individuals: Eddie George, Patty Hearst, someone's
uncle. Anyone who needs to be given food for thought.
The words are their own, seemingly spontaneous musings on the gulf
between rich and poor, the attitudes of those with visible power and the
near impossibility of imagining a future when the present is so muddied
by social inequalities and a driven need to shape your identity through
material gain. There is a marvellous skein of grotesque humour in all
this, as well as an attractive common sense. On the one hand there is
hot technology -- digital photography, alive DJ -- on the other there is
the abiding humanity and intelligent concern of Christine Molloy and Joe
Lawler (the desperate optimists) enhanced by the presence of Weaver.
These really are performers of conscience and imagination, with
thought-provoking material that chooses not to thump tubs but instead
insinuate itself into our thoughts -- what better start could there be
to this current season of Amnesty-related programming on the topic of
freedom.

Ian Bell looks at the work which has brough poet Seamus Heaney fame,
and Nobel riches
THEY say real poetry is elusive, but sometimes poets can be just as
hard to locate. Yesterday afternoon, while Ireland celebrated, Seamus
Heaney was holidaying in Greece oblivious to the news -- surely worth a
sonnet or two -- that he had just become the world's first
million-dollar poet.
Yet the richest Nobel Prize for Literature thus far conferred -- the
Swedish Academy having speculated cannily against a weak dollar -- was
no real surprise. Heaney, aged 56, generally recognised as Ireland's
greatest poet since W B Yeats, had been tipped before. And if the Swedes
seemed to be paying pious homage to the Irish peace process as much as
to art, that too was predictable.
One of nine children born to a cattle dealer in Mossbawn, County
Derry, Heaney has published 14 volumes of poetry and achieved a
reputation across the English-speaking world.
Formerly professor of poetry at Oxford, currently Boylston professor
of rhetoric and oratory at Harvard, and a member of the Irish Academy,
he is not known to envious Irish scribblers as ''Seamus the Famous'' for
nothing.
As one American critic said recently: ''It would be fair to say that
Seamus Heaney is now the most successful and widely read contemporary
poet in English. He stands as that rare colossus who can bestride both
the Atlantic and the Irish Sea. In all three literary cultures, and at a
comparatively early age, he is a critical touchstone.
''His books are big sellers, and his readings thronged. In Ireland, he
is considered a national hero. The English, temperamentally suspicious
of hype, have had to whisk him to appearances by helicopter. In America,
he is a Harvard professor.''
The Nobel, in other words, is rich icing on an already rich cake for a
self-styled ''world citizen''.
Yet Heaney is another rare thing: a political poet who has refused to
become the captive of any faction. Praising ''works of lyrical beauty
and ethical depth'', the Nobel citation accurately states: ''As an Irish
Catholic he has concerned himself with analysis of the violence in
Northern Ireland -- with the express reservation that he wants to avoid
the conventional terms.
''In his opinion, the fact that there has been unwillingness on both
sides to speak out -- even about manifest injustices -- has been of
great importance . . .''
Heaney, at heart a poet of nature and rural life, has described the
''caution that came upon (Irish poets) in the late 1960s, early 1970s,
because of the collusion between high national rhetoric and possibly
low, dangerous activities of the IRA . . . The appetite for uttering a
big truth shouldn't be altogether rebuked, you know. But how is it to be
uttered? That is the question.''
His own solution lay in constant migration -- to the Republic, to
America -- and in eluding the ambitions others tried to set for him. In
his own words, he is ''in between''; born a Catholic in the north,
settling as a northerner in the south, and always an Irish poet in an
English culture.
Educated at St Columb's College in Derry, he went on to Queen's
University in Belfast. In 1971 he spent a year in California, returning
to find that the situation in the north of Ireland had deteriorated to a
state of undeclared war.
In 1972, after teaching at Queen's, he moved south to County Wicklow.
From that vantage he was able to devote himself more completely to
poetry and liberate himself entirely of partisanship. Some nationalists
called it a betrayal; one Loyalist paper said good riddance to ''the
well-known Papist propagandist''.
Heaney started by writing poems which drew on his farm childhood in
Death of a Naturalist, (1966) and Door into the Dark (1969). He began to
explore the political turmoil of Northern Ireland with North in 1975,
and in 1979 with Field Work. His latest publication, in 1990, was a
collection of poems titled Seeing Things. Other works include Wintering
Out, Sweeney Astray, The Haw Lantern and, perhaps his masterpiece,
Station Island (1985).
It was said of Yeats that he was bigger than Ireland or its Troubles.
As Heaney joins his predecessor in the Nobel pantheon, he can now make
an equal claim. Holiday arrangements permitting, of course.

Bruce McKain examines the benefits and dangers when judging crimes
caught on camera.
NO-ONE need waste much sympathy on the two thugs who had their
sentences increased last week from four years to seven after a brutal
assault which was captured by security cameras.
The case does, however, raise two important issues for judges and the
public.
The issue for the judges is whether the increasing use of graphic
video evidence will influence the sentences they pass in cases of
violent crime.
The question for the public is how much influence their sense of
outrage can, and indeed should, have on the length of sentence that is
passed.
The appeal against what was seen as an over-lenient sentence of four
years was taken by the Crown and, as the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of
Earlsferry, pointed out, video evidence is likely to become more widely
available for courts.
Lord Clyde, the judge who originally dealt with the case, said in his
written report to the appeal court that he had been careful not to
''over-react'' to the fact that the evidence had been presented in such
a graphic manner.
Certainly, no words could have captured the savagery of the assault in
which the victim's head was rammed against a window before being jumped
and stamped on with brute force over and over again.
When the video was replayed in the Court of Criminal Appeal it
provoked gasps of horror from the public benches.
The court took the view that the video evidence placed the court in a
stronger position than normal because it allowed the judge to see for
himself what actually took place -- in other words, it turns the judge
into an eye witness.
What the judge faced with video evidence must do, according to the
appeal court, is react ''carefully and responsibly'' to what he has seen
with his own eyes.
The feeling among lawyers is that the increasing use of video evidence
will inevitably lead to heavier sentences. This is likely to happen even
in cases where there is no video evidence because the ''tariff'' for
assault cases will have increased.
The question of the public voice is much more controversial and arises
because of something said by Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, who
presided at the Court of Criminal Appeal which described the four-year
sentences as ''quite inappropriate''.
He outlined a number of circumstances in which the appeal court might
feel justified in increasing the sentence imposed by the original judge.
It might be necessary for the protection of the public or the impact on
the victim or because of the serious nature of the crime.
Lord Ross then added: ''There may be a situation where the sense of
public outrage at an offence is such that a more severe sentence is
necessary to mark that.'' For those who criticise judges for being out
of touch that remark will come as a welcome sign that some of them at
least are living in the real world.
But it has caused unease among defence lawyers who are concerned at
the risk that highly publicised cases will be judged not on their merits
but on screaming headlines and perhaps synthetic outrage drummed up by
the media.
Many cases which are prosecuted in the High Court would, by their very
nature, provoke a sense of public outrage -- the murder or sexual abuse
of a child, for example, or blinding and scarring a woman for life by
throwing acid in her face.
Presumably in that situation the court would simply base its sentence
on the serious nature of the offence, whether or not there had been a
public outcry. If judges are going to gauge the scale of public outrage
from their newspapers, TV and radio -- and where else are they going to
get their information -- they will have to tread extremely warily.
They will presumably bear in mind the number of times they criticise
the media for getting things wrong in reports of criminal cases.
Courts hand out frequent warnings to juries in high-profile trials to
reach a verdict based only on the facts brought out in court, not on any
publicity or outrage the case has attracted.
That is sound advice which should apply to judges just as much as
juries.

Not just Scottish Opera but all our major cultural institutions are
under threat, claims Michael Tumelty, from a political obsession with
money
EVERY possible permutation of outcomes for the fate of Scottish Opera
has been projected in a week of intense media speculation.
We have been told that the working group, comprised of the heads of
the big three clients of the Scottish Arts Council -- Scottish Opera,
the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, and the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra, under the chairmanship of company doctor Sir Lewis Robertson
-- will recommend that the opera orchestra should be disbanded, that
other orchestras will take over in the pit of the country's theatres
when Scottish Opera is in residence, that the company will be made
part-time -- and so on.
What needs to be said is this: today is the most alarming day in the
recent history of the Scottish music scene. There are political forces
at work here which are putting at threat the future existence, not just
of Scottish Opera, but potentially of any of our major cultural
institutions.
All the bitching and backstabbing, the pub gossip, and the accusations
of mismanagement that have fuelled much of the recent speculation about
Scottish Opera are red herrings. Whether any of them is true or not is
actually irrelevant.
There is only one thing that matters now. And it's a simple question.
Does this country want a full-time national opera company or not? By
full-time, let's be clear what we mean: a company with a full-time
administration, a full-time chorus, a full-time orchestra, premises,
transport, and all the rest. Anything else is less.
The issue is an artistic one, not, primarily, an economic one.
Scotland is unique. Unlike London where music companies exist in
multiples, Scotland has one of everything: a full symphony orchestra, a
broadcasting orchestra, a chamber orchestra, a host of smaller groups
with specific functions, and an opera company.
Like it or not, over the decades these companies have become national
institutions. They are an integral part of the cultural fabric of the
country, just as much as the treasured buildings, landscape and other
features of our heritage. Any argument over their future has to start
from that basis.
And this is where the real threat to Scottish Opera is coming from
this morning. There is a new philosophy rampant in the Scottish arts
world. It is practised by the funders, the Scottish Arts Council, and it
effectively refuses to acknowledge the intrinsic value or need to the
country of any of its institutions.
Nothing -- absolutely nothing, and I include the RSNO and SCO, which
will be tarnished by any dismembering of Scottish Opera -- is
sacrosanct.
Yesterday I asked Matthew Rooke, music director of the Scottish Arts
Council, for a background briefing on the entire scenario. Frankly, I
found what he had to say terrifying. I had to tell him that, politically
and philosophically, it was impossible to agree with one word he said.
Without even raising the question of vested interests or prejudices
(and there is a strong suspicion that the SAC doesn't much care for the
costly Scottish Opera anyway) certain things are clear. Within the
context of a funding freeze until 1999, the Scottish Arts Council does
not have the slightest intention of pursuing the case of Scottish Opera
with the Secretary of State. Or anyone.
The SAC, said Mr Rooke, argues the case with the Scottish Office for
its funding pot. It will not, he said, argue the case for any individual
organisation. ''The purpose of the SAC is not to look after any
individual organisations,'' he said.
Well, I'm sorry, but it should be. Somebody, other than Scottish Opera
itself, has got to explain to Michael Forsyth the role and function of
this and other companies, and argue the case to safeguard and properly
fund them. The SAC will just not let the buck stop at its desk.
As Mr Rooke continued it became apparent that the intrinsic value of
Scottish Opera or any company is no longer a premise for its funding.
''Our starting point is: here are the resources available; how best to
achieve in the arts in Scotland?'' he said.
Think about that. The starting point is not: here we have a treasured
opera company that folk like Sir Alexander Gibson sweated blood over and
committed their careers to, or anything like that. It's all, and only,
about money. The starting point and end point is cash.
If that is the prevailing philosophy then it is a sorry one. And don't
give me all that guff about pragmatism or economic realism. You get one
shot at these things in a lifetime. Let it go, even a bit, and it will
erode.
And Mr Rooke made it clear that not one penny would be removed from
any other source -- from music to literature -- to prop up the opera
company. But nobody asked him that. And that is not the issue.
The issue is simple. What is going to happen to our national
companies? Do we value them? Do we want them? If so, then they have to
be paid for. And if they are national institutions, then the nation
should pay for them, properly. And if the new-look, interventionist
Scottish Arts Council won't accept the responsibility, then who will?

General Secretary Campbell Christie explains how fears of gender
inequality forced the home-rule committed STUC to reject the latest
suggested wording of the proposals for a Scottish parliament.
THERE has been considerable comment during the past 24 hours about the
decision of the STUC General Council not to endorse the latest suggested
wording of the scheme for a Scottish parliament, concerning its size,
and I hope in this article to clarify the STUC's position.
Let me say right away that Michael Forsyth is quite wrong when he
suggests that the convention scheme has been torpedoed by the STUC
decision. There is no organisation more determined to ensure that we
have a parliament in Edinburgh than the STUC. It has been central to our
aspirations for many years, and we will move heaven and earth to ensure
that a scheme for a Scottish parliament is agreed at the Constitutional
Convention meeting on October 20.
I would also like to say, immediately, that we are concerned about the
proposed wording we had before us on Wednesday, not because it states
that the size of the Parliament should be 129, but because we have real
doubts about the key principles of an equal number of men and women in
the parliament and whether genuine proportionality can be delivered.
It is vital to all the people of Scotland that we should have our own
parliament. We believe passionately that a Scottish parliament is the
means by which we can transform our economy and build a better future
for our people.
Our wish for a say in the decision-making of our country is not new.
It goes back to the founding of the STUC, a hundred years ago. Our views
have developed and crystallised since 1897, and the call for devolution
has been repeated again and again at STUC Annual Congresses.
Over the years we have worked to build coalitions which would support
the claim for a Scottish parliament and we have consistently given our
support to organisations campaigning for a parliament in Scotland.
In 1988, when we set out with our partners in the Scottish
Constitutional Convention to prepare a scheme for a Scottish parliament,
we advocated that our parliament had to be absolutely different from the
Westminster Parliament which, to many of us, legislates for, but hardly
touches, the reality of the life of so many of our people.
A parliament which is open and accessible to all is what we would like
to see in Scotland. We want a parliament which is based on fairness and
justice, and which embraces the wide diversity and differences within
the various communities which are Scotland. That is why we want a
parliament which is truly representative of all political views in
Scotland and one in which women and men can play an equal part.
The establishment of a new parliament is a once-and-for-all
opportunity to ensure that we get things right. And one thing we must
get right is the balance between men and women in that parliament.
Through the efforts of many people within the Scottish Constitutional
Convention, we are now within sight of delivering a scheme which would
give us such a parliament. However, a new element has been added to the
whole debate.
The political parties -- the Scottish Labour and Scottish Liberal
Democrat Parties -- have now proposed that the size of the parliament
should be 129. This gives us real concerns that we will not be able to
achieve gender equality and proportionality.
Our original proposals were simple and straightfoward. We argued for
two members from each constituency, one woman and one man, with a
topping-up list to ensure proportionality. This has been rejected and,
in the mood of consensus within the convention, the STUC went along with
the voluntary electoral pact between the Scottish Labour and Scottish
Liberal Democrat Parties which gave guarantees around our key principles
based on a parliament of 145 members.
However, we have grave doubts as to whether a parliament of 129 will
be able to deliver. If the political parties can demonstrate otherwise,
then, of course we will be content. We need firm commitments from the
parties that they will put enforceable selection procedures in place
within their own parties which will guarantee gender equality and
proportionality. The parties must guarantee that women are given the
same opportunity as men to contest winnable seats in the electoral
system which the convention has agreed.
This means, for example, at least 25 women being selected for the 50
seats which, currently, Labour would be expected to win.
The establishment of a Scottish parliament provides a real opportunity
for women to achieve equal representation in a major decision-making
forum in our country. What a great pity it would be if we did not seize
this opportunity. I am not being macho here. I am not challenging the
political parties or questioning their power to take decisions. However,
in the spirit of the way the convention has worked until now I call on
them to honour the principles of fairness and equality which they have
all already agreed to embrace.
The STUC wants the scheme for the Scottish parliament to be endorsed
by all the partners to the convention on October 20. We are not trying
to wreck something we have worked so hard to achieve. I have been in
touch with George Robertson and Jim Wallace and I hope that we can sit
down together during the next few days and discuss the concerns of the
STUC General Council.

Gavin Stamp argues that after the orgy of demolition in the sixties
Glasgow seems to have learned nothing as preparations are made to knock
down the last tenements in the Gorbals
GLASGOW is still a city of tenements. It is this which makes it look
so different from cities in England, for the English never evolved this
urbane and sensible form of domestic architecture.
At their best, tenements rise above shops and define the most
important urban space -- the street -- while providing civilised
accommodation which can generate a community spirit.
As the late Frank Worsdall put it in his classic study The Glasgow
Tenement: A Way of Life: ''The tenement is the traditional form of urban
housing in Scotland, and it found its highest expression during the 19th
century in Glasgow . . . Glasgow is a city of tenements. Their polished
ashlar frontages of white and red stone have for centuries impressed
visitors unused to such well-built housing.''
Their virtues have not always been appreciated, however. In the 1960s,
in Glasgow's orgy of self-hatred and destruction, huge swathes of
tenemental housing were wiped out in the cause of comprehensive
redevelopment.
Many of the victims undoubtedly were slums but many were not, and it
is now conventional wisdom that so many of the tenements swept away --
even in the Gorbals -- were decent stone buildings which could and
should have been rehabilitated.
Extraordinary, therefore, to find that the last surviving tenements in
the Gorbals are now threatened with demolition -- and by the City
Council. These are in Oatlands on the eastern edge of the area next to
Richmond Park. Long, repetitive and, in their way, magnificent red
sandstone blocks running along Rutherglen Road, they were built in the
early years of this century and so are much later in date than the
notorious old slums of the Gorbals.
These blocks are decent, typical and good examples of Edwardian
tenement architecture. The design is simple but effective, with
repeating window bays articulating the long elevations and interest
given by classical detail with a hint of art nouveau. If they were in
Hillhead, or some other respectable part of the city, they would have
been rehabilitated long ago as desirable residences -- especially as
they look over Richmond Park and Glasgow Green. But as they are in
long-suffering Oatlands they seem to be regarded as expendable.
So why does the Housing Department wish to sweep these blocks into
oblivion? Four reasons are given. The least impressive of these is
traffic noise along the main road. As this affects many tenements in the
West End and elsewhere this hardly seems an issue, especially as there
are ways of dealing with noise, while the traffic can be re-routed or
calmed. Then there is the danger of chromium contamination from dumped
waste material from an old chemical works at Shawfield. This is a real
possibility, but as it would affect any new building on the site there
seems no good reason to pull the tenements down. Besides, the chromium
does not seem to worry those who would build the wretched M74 extension
nearby.
A more serious criticism of the tenements is that their internal
planning is unsuitable for modern tenants. If that is so, it is not the
fault of the original architects of the buildings, but more recently of
the City Council. In 1970, Oatlands was designated one of Glasgow's
first housing treatment areas after comprehensive redevelopment plans
had been abandoned. To quote the council's consultative planning study
for Oatlands published this year, the tenements ''were refurbished in
the 1970s, after having been left empty and open to the elements for a
prolonged period of time. Unfortunately, the renovated buildings
suffered from construction interruptions caused by changes in
contractors, poor design (in terms of flat layout and sizes as well as
the layout of back courts), and mediocre specification . . .''
The Housing Department also seems to have been responsible for the
last difficulty. Owing to a nearby burn, the basements are liable to
flooding. The authorities responded to this with the fatuous solution of
filling the basements with concrete, so making the water rise higher and
exacerbating the problem. In other words, the Housing Department has now
decided it does not wish to throw good money after bad and would rather
cover up its mistakes by abandoning the considerable investment already
made by the city in these buildings.
But the real reason for the determination of the Housing Department to
sweep away this last poignant corner of the old Gorbals is social, not
physical. Oatlands has been used as a ''sink'' estate by the council for
a number of years, with the result that crime and drug addiction are
rife. So rather than change its own management policies and tackle the
social problems, the authorities want to sweep away the problems along
with the buildings. One block has already been closed and boarded up and
a demolition order granted. It is the story of the Gorbals in the 1960s
in miniature.
This attitude runs counter to the prevailing official wisdom about
conversion and rehabilitation. ''It is local people who have been
directly responsible for much of the transformation in the city's
appearance; their stone-cleaning and refurbishment projects discovering
architectural swans in the ugly ducklings of sooty, neglected
tenements,'' insisted Glasgow's bid document for the City of
Architecture and Design in 1999 -- a bid which made much of
participation and ''empowering the people''.
This does not seem to be happening in Oatlands. The Gorbals Umbrella
Group has not been consulted by the Housing Department and it feels that
local people are not being offered any real choice in the future of the
tenements. At a recent public meeting on the issue, representatives from
the Planning Department were suddenly unable to attend. The Gorbals
Umbrella Group insists that it is not opposed to demolition if that is
the most sensible option, but it feels that there has not been a proper
consultation process.
0 The city's consultative planning study for Oatlands proposes several
options for new buildings with or without the old. But the likelihood is
that if the tenements go there will be yet another long-term derelict
site like the one next door. The irony is that further west in the
Gorbals, the Crown Street Regeneration Project team insists that ''they
have learned the lessons of assuming that the problems of an area are
solved by new buildings, and that solutions can be arrived at in
isolation from the community''.
As rare survivors in the poor maltreated Gorbals, these tenements
deserve respect as a landmark as well as for their intrinsic qualities.
If the City Council succeeds in demolishing them it will suggest that so
much of the talk behind the City of Architecture and Design victory is a
sham and that nothing has really changed -- that Glasgow's first
reaction to a problem is still to send in the demolition men.

Bishkek
ALL 15 people on board, including two Britons, were feared dead after
a helicopter contracted to a Canadian gold mining company crashed in the
mountains of Kyrgyzstan.
The Britons, nine Canadians and a Turk were travelling with three
Kyrgyz air crew to Bishkek from a mountainside mine in the former Soviet
republic when the helicopter went missing yesterday.
The helicopter was later sighted crashed on the mountainside, but bad
weather was reported to be hampering rescue work.
''Emergency work has started but the rescuers' helicopter could not
land,'' said Ivan Peshy, head of the rescue team.
The downed helicopter was at an altitude of 12,000ft and strong winds,
snow and clouds meant that rescuers could not establish the fate of the
passengers, who had finished a tour of duty with the Kumtor Gold Company
and were on their way home.
The mine is scheduled to begin producing gold in 1997.
''There are no signs of survivors,'' said company spokeswoman Rita
Mirwald. -- Reuter/AP.

Singapore
A CLAIM by a Briton that he killed a tourist in Singapore in
self-defence was dismissed by prosecutors today.
John Martin, also known as John Martin Scripps, is accused of killing
and chopping up South African brewery engineer Gerard Lowe, who
disappeared in March.
Scripps, 35, faces the death sentence if convicted.
Pieces of Lowe's body wrapped in black plastic bags were found in
Singapore harbour in March.
On the fourth day of a High Court trial prosecutor Jennifer Marie said
Scripps practised forging Lowe's signature, suggesting the killing was
premeditated.
She showed the court items seized from Scripps' luggage, including a
notebook and tracing paper filled with practice signatures of Lowe's
name.
She also produced credit cards, passports and other documents she
alleged had been tampered with.
Scripps was carrying passports, credit cards, and other personal items
belonging to Lowe and two Canadians murdered in Thailand when he was
arrested at Singapore's Changi airport on March 19.
He has claimed the killing was a sudden response to unwanted
homosexual advances.
The trial was adjourned to October 9.--Reuter.

NATO Defence Ministers began a two-day meeting today to thrash out
plans for sending a peace force to Bosnia, review relations with Russia,
and examine plans for expansion to the east.
The ministers, meeting in Williamsburg, Virginia, are seeking an
agreement on the command structure for the Bosnia force, which could
include up to 25,000 US servicemen, to police a final peace deal.
The multi-national force would have the backing of a Security Council
resolution, but be under Nato command.
A British official said the UN would delegate control of the military
operation to Nato only after a final peace accord is signed. He added
that British troops in the Rapid Reacion Force supporting UN operations
in Bosnia would switch from UN to Nato command on the day after an
accord is signed.

Washington
THE Gulf coast of north Florida is bailing out today, while torrential
rains continue to drench inland states as the remnants of hurricane Opal
pass over them. Alabama and Georgia had up to 10in of rain, and heavy
rains can be expected all the way to the Canadian border in the next
three days.
Six people have been killed by the storm. The damage was not as bad as
hurricane Andrew in 1992, but bad enough. More than one million people
are without electricity and there has been at least $1.8bn worth of
damage to coastal cities: Panama City and Pensacola were worst hit.
The storm was plotted as it crossed the Atlantic and into the
Caribbean: it killed 10 in Mexico on Tuesday then turned sharply
north-west towards the US. It strengthened greatly, becoming a class
four hurricane, with winds of 140mph.
Then it accelerated, travelling at 23mph towards the coast, barely
giving residents time to get out of the way.
Just two months ago, a smaller hurricane followed almost the same
route: Erin, a class three storm. There were two other monster storms,
Felix and Luis, this season.
Three class four hurricanes in one year is very unusual, and the
season has another six weeks to go.
Between 1947 and 1969, 13 such storms reached the Americas. Those were
years of normal rainfall in Africa. Now that an 18-year African drought
has ended there are more hurricanes than ever, and the odds are that
every year one or more will hit the US.
The most violent was Camille, in 1969, which devastated the Gulf
coast, killing 256 people. Hugo in 1990 and Andrew in 1992 caused heavy
damage, the first to the Carolinas, the second to southern Florida, but
took far fewer lives because modern forecasting gives people warning.
However there have been profound changes in the United States in the
past 30 years. There are now 40 million people living in coastal areas
vulnerable to hurricanes.
The most extreme disaster would be a storm like Opal coming ashore 100
miles west in the Mississippi delta, carrying a 20ft storm surge with
it. New Orleans, with 1.5 million people, is below sea-level, and could
be wiped out.
California lives in constant fear of a huge earthquake. The real
danger to the United States is a super-hurricane.

Banja Luka
SOLDIERS and civilians in the northern Bosnian Serb stronghold of
Banja Luka reacted with a mixture of joy and scepticism to today's
announcement of the US-brokered ceasefire.
Many residents had not heard the news several hours after it was
announced because power cuts have blacked out many television screens
since the capture of a power plant to the south by Muslim and Croat
troops last month.
''Thanks be to God,'' cried one young Serb soldier walking along the
darkened streets of Banja Luka while on leave from front lines. ''All
the soldiers in the battle areas have been longing for this. We just
want the fighting to stop.''
Serbian Orthodox priest Milivoje Topic, expelled with his family from
Croatia in 1991, said: ''Everyone is going to be pleased. The church
never supported this war.''
His wife said: ''We are sick of killing. Let peace come and refugees
be allowed back to their homes.''
The Banja Luka area is still struggling to feed and shelter tens of
thousands of Serbs made homeless by a Muslim and Croat military
offensive in September.
Some Banja Luka residents were unwilling to celebrate the
announcement, recalling scores of short-lived ceasefires earlier in the
Bosnian war.
None expressed gratitude for the US-led peace initiative. They were
still angry at the Nato bombing campaign a month ago which helped tilt
the military balance against the Serbs.
''The Americans are idiots,'' said a middle-aged housewife who lost a
son in the war between Serbia and Croatia in 1991 and has another
serving on front lines in Bosnia.
''We Serbs were their friends for years. We loved the West. Now I
wouldn't go there for anything.''
On the opposite side of the conflict, Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic welcomed the ceasefire agreement as a ''serious agreement''
and said he thought it would be respected by both government and
separatist Serb troops.
''I think this is a serious agreement and we will respect it. I think
the Serb side has the interest in respecting it too,'' he told reporters
in Sarajevo.
However Izetbegovic made it clear that there was no formal constraint
on military activity across the country in the next five days.
''There are no limits in this regard, which means that the ceasefire
starts effectively on the 10th, which mean it does not start today,'' he
added.
A government source said the Serbs were ready for the ceasefire to go
into effect today but that Sarajevo had insisted utilities to the
Bosnian capital -- which are controlled by Serbs besieging the city --
be turned on first.
The condition is not without risk to the government, which captured a
huge swathe of territory in the north-west of the country from Serb
forces in September but is now facing successful counter-attacks.
In Banja Luka, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said the Serbs
were indeed ready to honour their side of the agreement but it was too
early to celebrate an end to the war.
The Serbs, he said, would not accept any peace map based on gains made
by the Muslim-led government army helped by Croat forces in a big
offensive last month. Serb troops are now fighting to recapture the lost
territory.
Tonight the Bosnian Serbs were reported to have entered the
government-held town of Kljuc in north-west Bosnia. Street fighting was
under way and it was only a matter of hours before Serb units recaptured
it, the Bosnian Serb news agency Srna reported.
Muslim and Croat forces, which captured the town last month, were said
to be withdrawing in disarray towards Drvar and Bosanski Petrovac.
Fighting was also continuing on other front lines in northern Bosnia.
Bosnian Serb vice-president Nikola Koljevic said in Banja Luka that
the announcement of the ceasefire, due to come into force on October 10,
was unlikely to bring an immediate halt to such clashes.
The truce is scheduled to last for 60 days or until a peace conference
is held. The US is hoping to use the breather to mediate an end to the
42-month Bosnian war.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Attack on managers' stress for profits</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S managers were criticised last night for deliberately putting
workers under stress in a bid to boost profits.
Modern management practices, especially the use of short-term
contracts, came under fire at the official opening of an anxiety and
stress research centre at Stirling University.
The new centre is jointly funded by the university and the National
Health Service.
It will investigate stress in different occupations and compare the
effectiveness of different treatments for patients suffering from
anxiety disorders.
The driving force behind its establishment has been Bridge of Allan
GP, Dr Richard Simpson.
He made history this week when he became an honorary professor at the
university, the first time a non-staff member has been given such a
position in the psychology department.
Dr Simpson, 52, said: ''There's an objectional style of management
which is to keep people uncertain. They see this as a valid way of
managing their workers, and it may be better for the profit line, but I
think it's quite unacceptable.
''Every generation has its different stresses. Today's pensioners
would say they were just as stressed by the war as people today are by
other things.
''But I think factors such as short-term contracts, when there's no
permanence of employment any more and people run the risk of being made
redundant not once, not twice, but maybe repeatedly in your lifetime, or
may have to change the direction of their work more than once in a
lifetime, are new stresses.
''Increased rate of divorce and repossession of houses are also big
problems.''
Dr Simpson named Marks and Spencer as an example of good employers who
tried to head off stress by supporting workers. He said the caring
approach paid off in increased productivity.
The university's researchers have already carried out extensive
studies into stress levels among GPs and consultants.
They have also been advising the Scottish Prison Service on how to
prevent suicides in jail.

A GREEN-fingered Scots schoolboy will have quite a pumpkin to make all
his friends jealous this Hallowe'en.
For 10-year-old Alistair Mackenzie, of Caulfield Road North,
Cradlehall, near Inverness, has grown a monster lantern holder this year
which weighs in at 29lbs.
With tender loving care he has grown the pumpkin, nicknamed the Big
Yin, from a seed to the monstrous size it is now.
He said: ''I put the seed in a pot in my bedroom in the spring. I
planted it out in the garden and the hot summer weather and the contents
of the compost heap did the rest.''
The youngster spends half an hour each schoolday and more at weekends
growing fruit and vegetables in his own corner in the family garden.
His skills have not gone unnoticed as he picked up first prize in the
junior class at this year's Inverness Flower and Garden Festival for a
10oz onion and a 14lb pumpkin . . . the Big Yin not being ready for the
show.
Yesterday, his father, John, said: ''We are all keen gardeners in the
family and it is good that young Alistair has picked it up as well.''
Alistair said: ''My friends thought it was a strange hobby at first
but after they saw my prized pumpkin, a lot of them have become
interested in gardening as well.''

Kandami barracks, Comoros,
VETERAN soldier of fortune Bob Denard, soaked but stubborn,
surrendered today to French forces which wrecked his six-day coup in the
Comoros.
In a tropical downpour, the 66-year-old mercenary commander marched
from Kandami barracks accompanied by two of his lieutenants, and into
the hands of the waiting French.
Stubborn to the end, Denard maintained that what he agreed to was not
surrender, and failed to salute French officers.
''There are no conditions, there is no surrender. We are leaving here
to put ourselves at the disposition of the French forces which are in
Moroni,'' he said, limping from an old war wound.
''I received assurances that we would be taken under the care of these
forces along with the Europeans who are part of my group and the
Comorans under the command of Captain Combo,'' he said.
Denard, who left with his mercenaries and some 500 Comoran rebel
troops in groups of 10, was frisked by an anti-terror squad then driven
away in a convoy of paratroopers and special forces.
He was later flown to the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion aboard
a French air force transport plane. French authorities said he would be
taken to France for trial.
In Addis Ababa, the Organisation of African Unity appealed to France
to put Denard and his men on trial for what it called ''their subversive
and destabilising activities'' in Africa and the Comoros.
Before his surrender Denard said he did not know what would happen to
his men, saying ''anything could happen in the next hours''.
Asked if France's intervention to oust him yesterday had put an end to
his long career in combat, Denard replied: ''Do I look like someone who
is going to retire?''
He said the French Government gave no support to his coup in the
Indian Ocean islands. ''I arranged it all myself,'' said Denard, who is
married to a Comoran and is a convert to Islam.
However, mercenaries under his command said they joined the operation
because they believed it was backed and financed by the French
Government, and were now worried about their future.
Comoran rebels loyal to Denard were granted an amnesty by the Comoros'
Prime Minister yesterday, before their surrender.
France, which ruled the Comoros until independence in 1975, sent 600
troops to the islands to flush out Denard and rebel Comoran officers who
had seized President Said Muhamed Djohar during the coup, in which at
least seven people died.
The president, who was exhausted by the ordeal, was released yesterday
and flown to Reunion for medical attention.
It was the second time French forces had ousted Denard, who was the
Comoro Islands' uncrowned king for 12 years until he fled to South
Africa in 1989 after a bloodless French intervention.--Reuter.

A WOMAN accused of robbing a Canadian bank while her son waited
outside in his pushchair was set to appear in court today for a bail
hearing.
Carol Anthony, 29, was charged yesterday after two tellers were robbed
of cash at a branch of the Bank of Montreal in Kitchener, Ontario. After
the robbery, she fled down the street to where her
two-and-a-half-year-old son was waiting, said police Sergeant Steve
Hibbard.
Police said the bank manager chased her and caught up as she was
trying to change clothes beside the puschair. She ran off but returned
and blasted her pursuer in the eyes with pepper spray, grabbed the
pushchair, and tried again to escape.
The bank manager and a firefighter finally apprehended them,
authorities said. --Reuter.

Toronto
TWO American fugitives known as ''Thelma and Louise'' have been
arrested in Toronto, five months after jumping #300,000 bail in Houston.
Ms Joyce Carolyn Stevens, 31, and Mrs Rose Marie Turford, 36, wanted
on charges of kidnapping and robbery, were captured after police
received an anonymous tip. Later, they were seen laughing in the back
seat of an immigration department car en route to a city detention
centre.
''We've been on this merry chase for a couple of months now, and it
paid off,'' said Detective Sergeant Bob Montrose, of Toronto police.
Mrs Turford, a nurse with three children, originally from London,
Ontario, was arrested at a city centre phone sex service where she
worked under a false name.
Ms Stevens, a minister's daughter, was arrested at a house in the
suburbs.
US authorities allege the women devised elaborate schemes, including a
fake dating service, to fleece men in Las Vegas, Houston, and Galveston,
Texas.
The two were arrested on March 14 at a Houston motel, and charged with
three counts of aggravated robbery for hold-ups at gunpoint of three men
who fell for the dating scheme.
They were later charged with kidnapping and robbing another man, and
police say they may be connected to nine other incidents.
The two jumped bail on May 13 in Texas and then went on a crime spree
spanning the United States, police say.
Detective Ron Reid of the Toronto police said the two are being held
on immigration charges and warrants from Texas pending extradition.
The alleged crimes shocked those who knew the women as quiet friends,
prompting police and newspapers to begin calling them ''Thelma and
Louise'' after the 1991 film about two women fugitives who go on a crime
spree.
According to friends and police reports, the two became friends three
years ago, soon after they began working together at a hospital.
It is unclear just how the alleged crimes came about, but some
officials believe Ms Stevens told her new friend phoney tales of
espionage and danger and eventually lured Mrs Turford into the scheme.
''It just doesn't make any sense,'' Mrs Turford's lawyer, Mr Mike
Lamson, said in August. ''I mean, she's a hard-working registered
psychiatric nurse. Her husband is an executive with a computer company.
Upper-middle class. It just doesn't jive.''
When his client vanished last May, Mr Lamson contended that she had
been kidnapped.
Since then, the two women had been spotted several times in Canada.

Ontario. Her husband works in Michigan. -- AP.

SCOTTISH local government should consider setting up a permanent
watchdog body to defuse any future ''jobs for the boys'' rows over
council appointments, the chairman of the present staff commission told
a high-powered gathering of council leaders and officials yesterday.
Mr Robert Peggie has been at the eye of the storm as the Government
ordered a crackdown on some of the new councils who had been accused of
making appointments to senior posts by patronage rather than merit.
He has strongly defended the present temporary commission, which will
be wound up next year, against accusations of being too soft by spelling
out its lack of powers to coerce councils to obey its guidance.
Mr Peggie told a Cosla conference in Pitlochry that there was a lack
of universal guidance on appointments and there was no means by which
the required high standards could be monitored.
''The present day arrangements are informal and in my view there is an
urgent requirement to create more formal means by which the integrity of
the appointments system is secured. I suggest that some form of standing
commission be created and I would welcome a wider debate on the most
effective way of achieving that end,'' he said.
Last week the present commission passed a dossier of information about
the way some job appointments were made by the new North Lanarkshire
Council to the Secretary of State Michael Forsyth. He is considering
what action to take.
Mr Peggie said that the exercise of the right of
democratically-elected members to have a major say in the recruitment of
staff must bring with it an over-riding responsibility to ensure that
all appointments are seen to be made on a fair and unbiased basis.
The whole process must be open to scrutiny to ensure that the duty to
appoint on merit was beyond reproach, he told the conference.
Cosla's Labour president Rosemary McKenna's immediate response to the
proposal was ''let's talk about it within local government''.
Both she and Mr Peggie identified the main problem as being how much
power could be given to a new commission.
Later Unison's head of local government Scotland, Mr Mark Irvine,
attacked the way Mr Forsyth was now becoming involved in the ''jobs for
the boys'' row.
He warned that Mr Forsyth was no friend of Scottish local government
and would simply use such opportunities for his own political ends.
Unison had suggested to the staff commission that Cosla and the trade
unions should become more actively involved through their joint forum to
help resolve difficulties and promote good practice over appointments.
For the future, Mr Irvine also told delegates that if Scottish local
government suffered financial cutbacks as a result of this year's
Budget, councillors and unions must come out fighting in the defence of
services.
Meanwhile, councillors in the new single-tier Fife authority could
become the first to have their performance professionally monitored.
Under a pioneering scheme to be unveiled at a council meeting in
Glenrothes later today senior councillors would be given a job
description which would include an indication of the minimum number of
hours they should devote to council work.
Elected members would also be expected to keep a monthly record of
their activities and prepare an annual report for their constituents.
Fife's Labour leader councillor Alex Rowley said the public needed to
feel confident that their elected members were doing their very best for
them.

United Nations,
THE Pope appealed to the United Nations today to rise above its cold,
bureaucratic status and become a true family of nations that could usher
in a ''new springtime of the human spirit''.
The leader of the world's one billion Roman Catholics made his plea in
the soft tones of a pastor to a General Assembly marking the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations at a time of unprecedented challenge
to its world role.
The 75-year-old Pontiff said the need for the United Nations was even
more obvious now, half a century after its founding at the end of the
Second World War.
''The United Nations Organisation needs to rise more and more above
the cold status of an administrative institution and to become a moral
centre where all the nations of the world feel at home and develop a
shared awareness of being, as it were, a 'family of nations','' he said.
''We can build in the next century and in the next millennium a
civilisation worthy of the human person, a true culture of freedom. We
can and must do so. And in doing so, we shall see that the tears of this
century have prepared the ground for a new springtime of the human
spirit,'' he declared.
The diplomats listened attentively and then responded with a rare,
standing ovation.
The Pope said the UN should serve not only as a centre for the
mediation of conflicts but also foster values and initiatives that
raised relations between nations ''from simple 'existence with' others
to 'existence for' others''.
''Only on this condition shall we attain an end not only to wars of
combat but also to cold wars,'' he added.
Recalling the vast changes that had occurred since the last papal
visit to the UN, in 1979, the Polish-born Pope mentioned the defunct
Soviet Union.
''Unfortunately, even after the end of the Second World War, the
rights of nations continued to be violated,'' he said. The result was
the Cold War and the threat of a nuclear holocaust.
''It was only when freedom was restored to the nations of Central and
Eastern Europe that the promise of the peace which should have come with
the end of the (world) war began to be realised for many of the victims
of that conflict.''
He added: ''Unhappily, the world has yet to learn how to live with
diversity, as recent events in the Balkans and central Africa have
painfully reminded us.'' -- Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Narrow defeat of left-wing call to scrap Trident strengthens leader's hold on party. Blair hails victory on defence</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>BENEDICT BROGAN, POLITICAL REPORTER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<FLAG>ANNUAL CONFERENCE,</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>976027904</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Labour conference yesterday voted to reject left-wing demands for
the scrapping of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent -- confirming the
extent to which party leader Tony Blair's reforms have been accepted.
Delegates voted by a narrow 55.2% to 44.8% to back the leadership and
defeat a motion calling for Trident to be abandoned, with the savings to
be redeployed on public services.
Mr Blair welcomed the result as a sign of a new maturity in the
party's attitudes to defence. The victory reversed two years of
conference votes against Trident, which the leadership had resolutely
ignored.
He said: ''This is one more sign that the Labour Party is now a modern
left-of-centre party, totally in tune with the interests of the British
people. This vote shows a new maturity in the party's attitude to
defence.
''In advance of this conference, the media saw the Labour Party as in
revolt against the leadership, but on issue after issue we have seen a
party united, sensible and determined to build the Britain we all want
to create.''
The party's armed forces spokesman, Motherwell North MP John Reid,
called on the conference to accept that Britain's international position
required hard decisions. ''We are now a party that prefers to be in
power-making decisions rather than in opposition talking about
decisions.''
He accepted that a nuclear-free world remained a goal. However, to
achieve it required a practical programme of action, which a Labour
Government would implement by placing Britain's nuclear deterrent on the
table in disarmament negotiations.
''This offers the prospect of a Labour Government leading other
nations in a worldwide solution, not opting out of the disarmament
process.''
The Trident-scrapping motion before conference took Britain out of
world moves to de-escalation, he said. The British people did not want
one-sided disarmament.
''You can't solve domestic economic and industrial problems by
nationalisation. You can't solve a worldwide nuclear problem by
nationalising it either.''
The motion opposing calling for Trident to be scrapped was pushed to a
card vote after an often tense debate in which its supporters used
points of order to claim they were being prevented from speaking by the
platform.
Ms Gill Collins (Orpington) claimed that 50% of people in Britain now
thought nuclear weapons unnecessary: ''The bad old days of the Labour
defence bogey are going. The Tories are losing their ammunition.
''Trident is a massive, costly white elephant that should soon be with
the dinosaurs.''
The motion claimed Britain's acquisition of Trident had encouraged
France and China to continue nuclear testing, and called for the
American-designed submarine missile system to be scrapped. Its operating
costs, which it put at #30bn over 25 years, should be diverted to
civilian use.
Earlier, Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told delegates that
international stability was under threat from the nuclear arsenal held
by the former states of the Soviet Union, ''now maintained by
demoralised forces that cannot even pay the electricity bill''.
He added: ''That is why agreement on disarmament of those nuclear
weapons is no less urgent than at the height of the Cold War.''
The conference backed a motion urging France to call off its programme
of nuclear weapons tests in the South Pacific.
Mr Cook accused President Jacques Chirac of undermining moves towards
a comprehensive international test ban treaty.
* The leadership averted one possible defeat when, citing time
pressures and technical factors, it decided not to allow votes on
motions calling for Britain's defence spending to be cut to the average
level of other Western European countries.
The previous six Labour party conferences have backed such calls.

Los Angeles
O J SIMPSON called it the source of his ''basic anger'' -- the
distortions, as he described them, of the evidence in his double-murder
trial.
''Fortunately, for me, the jury listened to what the witnesses said,
and not Marcia Clark's or (Christopher) Darden's or anyone else's
rendition of what they said,'' Simpson told CNN, speaking out for the
first time since his acquittal.
The surprise phone call to Larry King Live came as King was
interviewing Simpson's lead defence lawyer, Johnnie Cochran.
Simpson didn't speak for long, but King squeezed in one more question,
asking Simpson about his first meeting earlier that day with his two
young children, Sydney and Justin, since being arrested on charges of
killing their mother.
''It's been great,'' Simpson said.
Any more comments from Simpson may have to wait for the TV
pay-per-view show in the works, a programme that could reap Simpson
millions.
Simpson remained out of sight for most of his second day of freedom,
but broke his silence to respond to a woman who called in asking about
prosecution claims that a shadowy figure seen moving across the driveway
of his house was him returning from an attempt to hide the bloodstained
glove on the estate.
Simpson said that prosecution testimony from limousine driver Allan
Park never showed this -- only that there was a person near the front
door.
''It was me -- walking out of my front door, dropping my bags, and
going back in,'' he said. Simpson's defence had said that Simpson was
racing around his house at about 11pm packing for a planned trip to
Chicago.
Simpson said prosecutors and legal commentators had misconstrued the
evidence.
He said he went back to his cell many nights and asked: ''Were they in
the same courtroom that we were in today? Did they hear the testimony
today?''
Simpson's friend Robert Kardashian, meanwhile, was reportedly behind a
$1m photo package offer to the supermarket tabloids that promised
exclusive photographs of Simpson's post-trial homecoming and the reunion
with his children.
Although more than 100 reporters staked out Simpson's Brentwood
estate, he reportedly slipped out yesterday to see his children. A
bakery clerk said she had served Simpson and Kardashian banana tofu
cakes and scones to go in the morning, and a CNN cameraman said he saw
Simpson hug seven-year-old Justin.
''Justin ran towards him,'' said Greg Canes. ''They embraced. It was a
wild embrace, it was a passionate embrace
. . . You could feel the emotion.''
Earlier, some of Simpson's jurors explained for the first time why
they acquitted him.
The jurors said they had reason to doubt almost everything prosecutors
threw at them: the blood, the glove, the socks, the detectives'
testimony.
''Mr Simpson was not guilty. It was not proven. I did not have enough
evidence to convince me that he was guilty,'' juror Brenda Moran said
during a news conference.
She also rejected any suggestions that the so-called race card was
decisive. ''My comment is, we didn't even deal with that deck, period.''
Another black juror, postal worker Gina Rosborough, said on Oprah
Winfrey's show that jurors had ''a lot of reasonable doubt from the
beginning'' about the prosecution's evidence, including the blood.
''I feel in my heart that he did not commit these crimes,'' she said.
''If he committed such a bloody crime, then there should have been more
blood in that Bronco than this
. . . little speck that we saw.''--AP.

NICOSIA: Move over Nintendo -- Iran is launching an Islamic computer

POTSDAM: Two German right-wing extremists were jailed yesterday for
destroying a Holocaust memorial at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp
during a wave of racist violence in 1992. Ingo Kehn, 22, and Thomas
Haberland, 25, were given 2[1/2] years and three years respectively
after a retrial in Potsdam. The verdict came as police reported damage
to a Berlin memorial for Jews deported to the Nazi death camps.

yesterday, killing nine people and wounding 19. The blast in Draa Ben
Khedda, 55 miles east of Algiers, was the fifth in the past month.
The hotel is in an anti-Islamist Berber area where there is strong
support for Said Saadi, an anti-fundamentalist candidate in presidential
elections due to take place next month. Islamic militants, fighting the
military-backed government for three years, have vowed to wreck the
November 16 poll which is also opposed by the main opposition parties.

NEW Labour, New Britain, New Conference. Renewal, rebirth, and a
recovered Brogan. Everything's coming up roses, even if the red rose has
disappeared from New Labour's fashionably narrow lapels.
Throughout the conference centre in Brighton yesterday, there were
signs of the strange transformation that has gripped the people's party
and all those who come into contact with it.
Having shaken off a hangover of Militant proportions, caused by too
much first-conference enthusiasm in the bars along the sea-front, it was
a New Brogan, New Liver that sat through the foreign affairs and defence
debates yesterday. Change was in the detail. Robin Cook stuck to
Labour's resolutely uncontroversial foreign policy. On Bosnia and
Northern Ireland, New Labour must be Tory Labour. But try this: Dundee
East constituency seconding a pro-Israel motion proposed by the
75-year-old Jewish section, Poale Zion? It happened.
Peter Court, from Dundee, addressing the conference, sounded amazed:
''Who would have thought, a few years ago, a motion proposed by Poale
Zion and seconded by the constituency party that were the first to raise
the banner of the Palestinian campaign?''
Modernisation is infectious. Moments later delegates voted to support
Trident. Really. After years of defeats, the leadership received
conference backing for its multilateral approach to nuclear disarmament.
In the end, the only potentially explosive moment came when the
conference condemned the ''scandal'' of the millions of land-mines built
by British companies and scattered across the globe by a succession of
civil wars. Euro-MP Dr Peter Truscott paused in his speech to pull out
of his bag what looked like a Harrods-green biscuit tin.
It was, in fact, a landmine, which he began to wave about with one
hand. With the other, he pulled out two letters, one from John Major
denying it was one, another from Ferranti confirming it was. From the
nervous looks on the platform, New Labour has more faith in Ferranti
than the Prime Minister.
And now it has faith in Lord Tebbit, who yesterday rode to the rescue
of Tony Blair's surprise deal with BT.
New Labour also means New Drinks. Late on Wednesday night, Willie
McKelvey, Kilmarnock and Loudoun MP, found himself enjoying one of those
endless apres-conference freebies. The only drinks on offer were
champagne or Buck's Fizz -- champagne and orange juice.
Willie, a true Socialist, can't drink champagne and asked the barman
if he had any whisky. He did, and from under the bar produced a generous
glassful: ''I've made it a double, sir''. ''You must have ESP,'' Willie
suggested. ''No sir, only Teacher's''.
By last night Labour officials were wandering around looking slightly
dazed. This is the first conference in living memory in which the
leadership will not have lost a vote. Tebbitt backs Tony. Conference
backs Trident. New Labour indeed.

NINE workers who lost their jobs with a former timeshare company have
been awarded a total of more than #11,000 in unpaid wages, commission
and redundancy payments.
All nine won their fight for money owed against Dunblane-based Gold
Crown Express Travel Ltd, who took over the controversial International
Resorts Sales and Travel Ltd's premises at 26-28 High Street, Dunblane.
The workers took their fight to a Glasgow industrial tribunal.
Eight of the nine had formerly worked for IRST, now in liquidation.
The ninth was taken on by Gold Crown.
Industrial tribunal complaints had been made against Mr William
Montgomery, managing director of IRST, and his company, but the tribunal
ruled the employment had been transferred to Gold Crown Express Travel
Ltd.
IRST ceased trading but, in January last year, the same premises
re-opened, using the same equipment and telephone number but under the
name Gold Crown Express Travel Ltd.
Mrs Charlotte McClumpha, one of the workers who was the former company
secretary, said she was told by Mr Montgomery that the staff were being
transferred but cheques were not honoured and staff claimed they were
owed wages. Gold Crown ceased trading in May last year.
Mrs Evelyn Kinnell, of Balfour Street, Bannockburn, was awarded #3115
in unpaid wages and redundancy pay. Her husband, Alexander, was awarded
#2000 for unpaid commission.
Mrs McClumpha, of Main Street, West Menstrie, was awarded #615; Mrs
Margaret Connor, from London,#1200; Miss Emily Law, of Earl Road,
Invergorrie, Dundee, #1152; Mr John McBride of Thornhill Road, Falkirk,
#721; Mr Alan Wray, of Manse Road, Aberfoyle, #1250; Miss Vera
Kosciewick, of Ledi Avenue, Tullibody, #900; and promotion manager Mrs
Maureen Taylor, of Bannockburn Road, Stirling, #1230.

THE COMPANY set up
with money from the former Highlands and Islands Development Board and
the Scottish Tourist Board collapsed owing almost #360,000.
Yesterday a sheriff banned three of its directors from being directors
of any company for the next two years.
The firm, Hi-Line, based in Dingwall, provided a computerised central
reservation system for the tourist industry but went bust in 1992 with
debts of #358,000, mainly to British Rail, Caledonian MacBrayne, and P &amp;
O Ferries.
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday took the three to
Dingwall Sheriff Court over the running of the eight-year-old company.
The men, Inverness businessman Mr Alistair Gardner, 65, a former
hotelier, Hi-Line's ex-managing director, Mr Ned Wayne, of Culbokie on
the Black Isle, and Mr Martyn Hill, of Coul House Hotel, Strathpeffer,
Ross-shire, faced a possible 15-year ban from the ''formation, promotion
and management'' of a company.
Several days were set aside for a proof before Sheriff James Fraser.
But after a short adjournment advocate Alan Dewar, for the DTI,
announced that the three men had agreed to accept a two-year
disqualification from involvement in the running of a company.
Mr Dewar said dishonesty was not involved but there had been a failure
to keep proper books and records.
There was also the matter of Hi-Line making a loan of #11,000 to Mr
Wayne which an auditor pointed out was against the Companies Act. The
loan was eventually repaid.
The implementation of the ban on Mr Gardner was postponed until
November 2 to allow him to make a motion to the sheriff that he be
allowed to remain a director of an existing unnamed firm.
The HIDB's successor, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, was also
closely linked with Hi-Line in its promotion of tourism.
The company received #60,000 from the HIDB and #65,000 from the
tourist board when it was set up.

SHADOW Northern Ireland Secretary Marjorie Mowlam last night warned
all sides in Ulster not to delay the peace process in the hope of
getting a better deal from a Labour government.
She promised continuing support for the Government's efforts to bring
about a constitutional settlement for the province.
Ms Mowlam told the party conference: ''We will not make political
capital out of Northern Ireland. Peace is too important for that.
''I want to see progress in the peace process. I don't want to see any
party or community prevaricate or procrastinate, waiting for a Labour
government because they believe they will get a better deal in the
negotiations.''
She said Labour would maintain its support for the Government because
Ministers had taken the party's policies and joined with the Irish
government to put them into international agreements.
Mrs Mowlam described the current logjam as ''peace but no process'',
insisting the only way to achieve lasting peace was through talks
involving all parties and the two governments.
For the talks to start everyone must show they had abandoned violence
for good: ''The issue of decommissioning paramilitary weapons must
therefore be addressed.
''We support the proposal for an international agency on
decommissioning to deal with this question -- in parallel with
bilateral, preparatory talks.''
Labour's policy was still unity by consent: ''It is not for further
integration into the UK nor for a return to Stormont.
''But if all the parties involved reach agreement on another
settlement, we would support that agreement.
''Consent and agreement are central. Without consent a balanced
constitutional settlement is impossible.
''It is clear that such a settlement must give full respect to the
traditions and aspirations of both communities.''
The conference later overwhelmingly approved a motion reaffirming
Labour's commitment to the unification of Ireland by consent.
Introducing the motion, Labour Party Irish Society delegate Lisa
Murphy emphasised there would be ''no coercion into a united Ireland''.
She urged: ''We cannot squander this historic opportunity. Insensitive
political management and too-little-too-late is unacceptable.''
Calling for ''political creativity and flexibility'', she added: ''We
urge both governments to progress a formula to resolve this problem and
simultaneously move the process forward into all-party talks.''
Mr Ivan Connolly, from Hackney North and Stoke Newington, told
delegates: ''The time is now right to move this process forward.
Negotiations should start as soon as possible.
''The principle of consent allowing all parties with a democratic
mandate, negotiating freely, should underpin these talks. The rights as
well as the different aspirations of both traditions should be
recognised and respected.''

A JUDGE yesterday left the bench to ponder the sweet little legal
mystery of three words -- Wet Wet Wet.
Lord McCluskey at the Court of Session in Edinburgh said he would need
more time to ponder the niceties of a complex legal wrangle involving a
biography of the Scots pop group.
The book by author Brian Beacom and entitled Wet Wet Wet -- A Sweet
Little Mystery, claims to be the inside story of the group.
Bravado, the group's merchandising company, said the book was an
unofficial biography in which there was a breach of copyright because no
permission was given to use the registered trademark, the words Wet Wet
Wet.
The judge will have to decide if the book should go on sale with the
present cover jacket and spine bearing the words Wet Wet Wet. Or whether
the Edinburgh publishers Mainstream will have to pulp that part of the
book.
Lord McCluskey thanked the advocates who presented the case for the
entertainment value of their debate.
After the hearing Wets manager Elliot Davis said: ''The judge appeared
to be having a good time. I am thinking of inviting him on our next
world tour.''
Meanwhile, about 10,000 copies of the book must remain under the
counter while the judge decides.
In August another Court of Session judge, Lord Sutherland granted an
order to Bravado which banned Mainstream from selling or distributing
the book with the cover title bearing the Wet Wet Wet trademark either
on the dust jacket or spine. Mainstream claimed the ban could mean an
immediate loss of about #60,000.
Mr Calum MacNeill, advocate for Bravado, claimed that the public would
confuse the book with an official group biography due to be out in time
for Christmas.
Mr McNeill suggested that if the title of Beacom's book had been Wit
Wet Wit or Wit Wit Wit, the trademark law might not have been infringed.
Mr MacNeill asked the court yesterday to make the earlier court order
permanent.
He said the contents of the book were not in dispute, but the use of
the three words on the book jacket and spine.
Mr Ronald Mackay, QC, for Mainstream, said it was absurd for Bravado
to contend that the words Wet Wet Wet could not be used.
He said: ''If that was the case then the words Wet Wet Wet could not
be used in magazines, periodicals or even a newspaper review of Wet Wet
Wet's last concert. That cannot be the case in law.''
Mr Mackay added that in the case of other company trademarks such as
Guinness, it would mean that it would be illegal to publish a book
entitled: Guinness -- a Sweet Little Mystery Of The Guinness Affair.
Lord McCluskey mused that according to Bravado's argument it might
mean that book jackets using the word Disney or sticks of rock bearing
the words Blackpool Rock might also be infringing the trademark laws.
Lord McCluskey said he would give his ruling in writing at a later
date.
Members of the group were not in court.

A GOLD ring lost on an Islay beach eight years ago has been returned
to its owner.
Former policeman Mr Tom Dunn, 56, lost the ring, a retirement gift, on
the beach at Kilnaughton Bay while he was feeding seagulls.
Mr Dunn, whose house overlooks the beach, said: ''I walk on the beach
every day with my two dogs and I've been looking for the ring for eight
years.
''I always kept hoping and hoping I would find it, but as the years
went by, that hope became less and less.''
But he reckoned without the metal-detecting skills of Mr Colin
Campbell, who stays in the nearby village of Port Ellen. Mr Campbell,
37, a joiner, showed the ring, which he found buried in four inches of
sand, to a friend who recognised it as Mr Dunn's.

AN adult sex-education video, described as the most explicit yet made,
is to go on sale in the High Street. The move has caused an uproar from
campaigners.
The 60-minute film, Fantasy Sex, includes scenes of bondage, force,
and orgies according to its distributors, PolyGram Video.
It was based on interviews in which men and women in Britain and the
US were questioned about their favourite fantasies.
The video stars Tony and Wendy Duffield, the couple who made love for
Desmond Morris's television programme, The Human Animal.
Mrs Mary Whitehouse, founder of the National Viewers' and Listeners'
Association, strongly criticised the censors' decision to clear the film
for distribution.
She said: ''How do they know that children are not going to see it. It
will teach bondage and the other practices. It is pornography, nothing
else.''
Dr Adrian Rogers, director of the Conservative Family Institute,
described it as ''a nasty day's work''.
Conservative MP Harry Greenway said: ''I think it's disgraceful and
sounds like pornography of the worst kind.''
The British Board of Film Classification said it was of an educational
nature and had been given an 18 certificate.

SHADOW Home Secretary Jack Straw last night softened his attack on
aggressive begging by ''winos,'' addicts and ''squeegee merchants''.
Last month, Mr Straw faced an outcry after calling for the police to
give a higher priority to clearing them from the streets.
However, at the conference last night, he emphasised the need to
tackle the causes of deprivation and poverty instead.
''We need action to provide jobs and training for the young
unemployed,'' he said.
''We need housing for the homeless, effective care for the mentally
ill, better treatment facilities for drug and alcohol abusers. Begging
on the streets and sleeping rough in shop doorways is no way for people
to have to live.''
Mr Straw said criminals once mainly robbed the rich. Now they mainly
robbed the poor.
Low-income areas knew all about the misery of crime. Their
neighbourhoods were being ''brutalised by graffiti and violence and
their lives made hell by criminal anti-social neighbours''.
He promised that Labour would:
* Give every local authority a statutory duty to work with the police
to  make their areas safe
* Free police officers from needless bureaucracy.
* Put more police officers back on the beat.

A COURT has heard how a shop owned by former St Mirren manager Tony
Fitzpatrick went on fire after a security guard disturbed a youth seen
trying to put lighted paper through the door.
The corner shop in Seedhill Road, Paisley, was run by the former Love
Street player who is now an SFA community coach. The incident happened
after he had locked up for the night in June.
Mr Richard Lewis, 19, of Falside Road, Paisley, denies two charges of
wilful fireraising, while acting along with another.
The jury trial at Paisley Sheriff Court heard how security guard Mark
Denny saw someone similar in appearance to the accused lurking at the
doorway of Mr Fitzpatrick's shop.
When he approached, he saw the youth trying to light pieces of paper
and push them through a gap in the shutters.
There was a strong smell of paraffin or petrol coming from the doorway
but by the time he reached the shop front, the youth had run off down
nearby Lacey Street.
Mr Tony Fitzpatrick, 39, told the court he had been forced to ban
several young people from the shop because of their behaviour.
The trial before Sheriff Colin Higgins continues.

A POLICE superintendent and a social services chief yesterday voiced
their frustration with English law's limited powers to deal with a gang
of children who have unleashed a minor crimewave.
The seven boys, aged between 12 and 15 and all in council care, have
committed more than 400 offences in less than six months.
They are regularly arrested and taken before the courts. However,
because they are not old enough to be sent to a young offenders' centre
they are remanded back into the care of social services.
The boys are residents at a local authority children's home in
Nottinghamshire.
Yesterday, Superintendent Alan Capps, acting divisional commander for
the area, told a meeting of Nottinghamshire Police Authority that since
November 1 last year the boys had been arrested 419 times.
In the six months since April 1, they have committed a total of 445
crimes.
''On many occasions my officers have detained the juveniles prior to
committing a crime and taken them back to the children's home,'' he
said.
''They take them to the front door and because social services are not
empowered to physically detain the offenders, the children run out the
back and go on further criminal rampages.''
In one 12-hour period, he said, the members of the gang committed 14
separate serious offences including burglary, car theft, and possession
of illegal drugs, such as ecstasy and cannabis.
Mr Gwilym Griffith, assistant director of Nottinghamshire County
Council social services department, called on the Department of Health
to reinforce social workers' guidelines to help them determine if they
had any formal powers of restraint over youngsters in their care.
A spokesman for the county's social services department acknowledged
the youngsters were causing problems, but insisted they were working
within the restrictions imposed by a difficult legal framework.

A SERVICE launched in Edinburgh yesterday is expected to help more
than 1000 older people a year with repairs and improvements to their
homes.
The city-wide service has been set up by Age Concern Scotland to help
people over 60 who are homeowners or private tenants.
Ms Ailsa Murray, manager of the organisation's care and repair
service, said it was hoped to help 1000 people a year with small repairs
and others with improvement grants.
The average income for an elderly householder was little more than
#5000 and improvements could cost an average of #15,000, she said.
The service would give advice on local authority grants, help
householders to apply for grants, organise and oversee building work,
and give details of reliable tradesmen.
The service had its own joiners for small repair jobs and householders
were asked to pay only for materials used, Ms Murray said.
The first to benefit was Mrs Anne Liljestrand, 74, whose house in the
city's Comely Bank area had two windows which were jammed and a front
door letting in draughts.
''I think the service is splendid,'' she said. ''Many people will be
delighted.''
Ms Maureen O'Neill, Age Concern's director, said it was assumed that
because a person owned their own home, they were financially secure. For
many this was a nightmare.

A MONGREL puppy, Bullseye, went from rags to riches yesterday as he
started a new life with the billionaire, Mr John Paul Getty II.
He was picked up from a pound by Mr Getty's chauffeur in a Land Rover.
He left the back streets of North-east England behind him as he was
driven down the motorway to the philanthropist's Buckinghamshire estate
to join the family's other dogs.
Bullseye had been arrested last week, apparently keeping watch beneath
a broken window of a house which had been burgled in Cramlington,
Northumberland.
He spent the night in police cells and led police to a housing estate
where a man was arrested.
The alleged jewel thief denied knowing the dog. They were both given
police bail while inquiries continued.
Officers took Bullseye to a dog shelter in Newcastle, but Mr Getty's
wife, Victoria, took pity on him after reading of his wayward life, and
decided to give him a new start.
Miss Joan Bennett, who runs the shelter, said she had not been sure if
the Mrs Getty who faxed her details was connected to the recluse, but
she had been sure he would go to a good home.
But she added: ''Now the cat is out of the bag and the dog's away.''
The Gettys were embarrassed by the leak of news of the addition to
their household in view of his criminal record.
Their chauffeur arrived at dawn to pick up the dog, who has been
described as friendly and good natured.
A spokeswoman for the family said later: ''There is no more to add.''
Northumberland police said Bullseye was free to go and would not be
required to give evidence.
A spokeswoman said: ''We wish him well in his new life. It's better
than winning the lottery.''

A FURIOUS political row broke out yesterday as the Home Office
confirmed it was considering plans to penalise employers who gave jobs
to illegal immigrants, amid signs of a Cabinet split over the idea.
Labour immediately called on the Government to drop any such
proposals, saying they would ''put an engine of racial discrimination
into the world of work'', while the business community called for urgent
talks with the Government on the matter.
Labour employment spokeswoman Ms Harriet Harman said: ''People from
ethnic minority communities, most of whom were born here and are British
citizens, already face discrimination in trying to get a job.
''We need to bring more fairness to the workplace, not turn the clock
back to when employers used to say 'no blacks need apply'.''
There was also criticism from immigrant welfare organisations and the
British Chambers of the Commerce said the idea was ''unacceptable''.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director general of the BCC, said businesses
were being asked to act as unpaid immigration officers.
''How on earth is an employer ever going to be in a position to check
whether or not any individual he or she employs has the credentials to
live in this country?
''What are they going to do -- ask to see their passports every time
they interview someone? It really isn't an efficient way of going about
things.
''If someone presents themselves for work, that is already
demonstrably a failure by the immigration services if that person is an
illegal immigrant. We don't see why business should carry the can for
that,'' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.

A GRIEVING mother yesterday called for changes in staffing at a
hospital where she claims she was told there was no-one available in the
casualty department to examine her baby son. He died a short time later
in a doctor's surgery.
Mrs Angela Smith, 27, of Dean Drive, Tweedmouth in Berwick said:
''This surely proves there is a need for a resident doctor at Berwick
Infirmary.''
She took 11-month-old Ryan, who had suffered from a heart defect since
birth, to the hospital when he became unwell on Tuesday.
''He was conscious but breathing heavily, but I was told by a nurse
there was no-one in casualty to examine him. The nurse contacted my
doctor and I was told to take Ryan to the surgery in Tweedmouth.''
As the doctor started his examination, Ryan stopped breathing and died
despite the efforts of paramedics. Ryan had surgery for a missing heart
valve when two days old and, although he was due to see a consultant
next week, was not on any hospital waiting list.
No-one was available for comment at the Cheviot and Wansbeck NHS Trust
which runs the hospital.

Hundreds of thousands of refugees are attempting to cross Europe's
yawning gulf between the rich and the poor. Ian Bruce reports on the
measures being taken to stop them.
A NEW Iron Curtain is descending on Europe from the Baltic to the
shores of the Mediterranean. But the freshly-drawn frontier of the post
Cold-War world is nothing to do with politics. This time round, it
reflects the yawning gulf between rich and poor.
The promised land of the industrialised West has become a magnet for
the deprived, the hungry, and the war-weary of two continents. Illegal
immigration has replaced the spectre of Soviet invasion as the main
focus of the threat to a comfortable way of life.
Five years after the Berlin Wall came down, relief has been superceded
by shock as hundreds of thousands of North Africans, Romanians,
Bulgarians, Poles, Bosnians, Albanians, Bangladeshis, and Pakistanis
flood across national boundaries in search of an illusory better deal.
Across Europe, perhaps three million refugees are on the move, driven
by war or famine. There are 750,000 legitimate political asylum seekers,
half of them in Germany. At least the same number again have entered the
area illegally and are living in a growing nether region of society's
black economy, existing just above the poverty line on slave wages.
The Continent has already absorbed 20,000,000 legal immigrants. Now,
while EU leaders debate the merits of the abolition of internal frontier
controls and passports, the barriers are quietly going back up around
the perimeter of the Community.
The Hungarians were among the first to pull down the wire and
watchtowers and dig up the mines which symbolised Communist
totalitarianism in 1990. Wire, guards, and dogs are back in place to
combat the human tide which threatens to swamp social resources further
west.
On the other side of the border, Austria reckons that it catches about
half of the desperate illegals -- mainly Romanian gypsies, known as
Zigeuner -- who try to penetrate its territory. For the 40-plus years of
East-West confrontation, it was the soft-option crossing point and a
conduit to the good life. Now Austria has enacted the most stringent
asylum legislation in Europe.
Britain is on the periphery of the demographic battleground but it is
not immune to its effects. The Home Office caught 13,000 illegal
immigrants last year alone. It admits privately that there may be as
many as one million -- principally Asians -- who have slipped through
the net and are living undetected with relatives.
The UK's main concern is the drain on its social services. The
illegals detained and deported last year are estimated to have cost the
taxpayer anything up to #100m in fraudulent health and social security
scams. The cost of the mass of unregistered aliens could run into
billions of pounds. No-one really knows.
The United Nations, the main source of statistics, concedes that its
own figures are based largely on ''guesstimates''. Some population shift
can be charted, as in the former Yugoslavia, but most is indeterminate.
A spokesman described it as being comparable to keeping tabs on grains
of sand on a Saharan dune in a high wind.
More accurate is the tally of registered immigrants, working within
the system. But they may be the tip of an iceberg of gargantuan
proportions. It is a potential demographic timebomb.
Germany, eager for cheap foreign labour in the boom years of the 1960s
and 1970s has a legal immigrant population of around seven million. Many
are Turks, the hard-working Gastarbeiter who have now outstayed their
welcome in the wake of the reuniting of the country's two halves.
Resentment over the job squeeze which was the first product of the
prosperous West absorbing the less affluent East has spawned a new
generation of Neo-Nazis. The easiest focus of their frustration is
foreigners. Ugly riots, more than 3500 assaults, and eight deaths in
hostel firebombings are a sign of a simmering backlash.
The German police found that ordinary, law-abiding people turned a
blind eye to the violence in many cases when attacks were investigated.
More enlightened politicians and law enforcement officials see nightmare
parallels with passive acceptance of Hitler's excesses in the late
1930s.
The German authorities caught 10,000 illegals last year. Many have
been forcibly repatriated. Others face a few months of detention before
sharing that fate. In the liberal Germany of the last 30 years, they
could expect to be housed and fed for up to three years while they went
through a thoroughly loopholed appeal procedure.
Bonn estimated that only about 5% of those who sought asylum
qualified. Yet hundreds of thousands were allowed to stay regardless.
Rising affluence and a falling birthrate had created a need for manual
workers. Turks and others became the hard-graft core of the economic
miracle.
A generation on, places like the Berlin suburb of Kreuzburg, known
locally as Little Anatolia, have become Turkish ghettos. Apart from the
Gastarbeiter, there are an estimated 100,000 illegals in the city,
absorbed for the moment in the frenzy of reconstruction which has turned
a reunited Berlin into the world's biggest construction project.
But trouble is never far away. A Berlin police department source said:
''We have less trouble with the Turks than with the new influx of
Romanian gypsies or Russian gangsters. They have increased street crime.
''The biggest problem is that we also have growing numbers of Kurdish
refugees. They and the Turks don't mix. They bring their ethnic feuds
with them and that causes resentment. Firebombings and murders between
the two communities do not endear them to native Berliners. The general
feeling is that they should take their problems back where they
belong.''
The ethic divide is even more marked in France, traditionally Europe's
second most liberal host nation. Marseilles, Lyons, and Paris are home
to 3,600,000 immigrants, principally North African Muslims from France's
former colonies.
Outbursts of anti-Islamic violence are common. The rise of the
right-wing in French politics with Jean-Marie Le Pen rivals German
xenophobia. Bombings in Paris by extremist Islamic fundamentalists have
not helped the cause of the vast majority of their fellow Muslims. It
has fanned the flames of ethnic unrest and intolerance.
The Muslims further alienate themselves from French society by living
in self-created ghettos. Integration on any appreciable scale is blocked
by religious prejudice and Islamic militancy. It is a combination
unlikely to endear the Africans to the average Frenchman.
France is, perhaps, the real powder-keg of the EU. Efforts to stem the
invasion of Moroccan, Tunisian, and Algerian refugees along its southern
rim are complicated by a lesser though significant trickle of east
Europeans from the north.
Spain, already the surrogate home of 500,000 Muslims, has much the
same dilemma. Both are tightening legislation and physical barriers to
reduce further encroachment.
Italy also shares the worst of both worlds. It has one million legal
immigrants within its borders, straining an always precarious economy
and infrastructure. A constant exodus from Albania, Europe's most
primitive country, is now adding to that burden. By comparison, the
poverty-stricken streets of Naples are paved with gold.
In recent years, boatloads of Albanians have been shipped back across
the Adriatic from the port of Bari. Many slip back on the next tide,
their numbers swollen by the human debris of the Yugoslavian tragedy. It
is a classic tale of the dispossessed becoming the unwanted.
Margherita Boniver, the former Italian Immigration Minister, has the
answer to the problem, although not the means to implement it. ''We are
sending the Albanians back to a living hell, but we have no choice at
the moment. Our aim should be to help Albania achieve some level of
normalcy,'' she said.
''Italy invaded Albania more than 50 years ago. Perhaps now we should
invade again, this time economically instead of militarily. If the
Albanians had jobs and a reasonable standard of life at home, they would
not come here. We owe them and our own people that much. But who is to
pay for it? I do not have the answer to that.''
In a perfect world, the resources and energy committed to the
pointless creation of beef and butter mountains in the EU would be
channeled into economic aid for the have-nots. Unfortunately, the world
does not work that way.
However, the West is rapidly being forced to face the prospect of a
crisis which cannot be tackled by Nato airstrikes or American shuttle
diplomacy. Opening internal borders while establishing a circled-wagons
mentality to the rest of humanity will not work in the long term.
The only solution is the siphoning off of cash and technology to raise
the expectations and lifestyles of countries beyond the rim of the
imagined Horn of Plenty. The alternative is police-state tactics and
military enforcement of boundaries. Strafing boatloads of helpless women
and children would not be a good PR move.
In any case, all borders, no matter how rigorously guarded, are
ultimately porous. The Soviets could never guarantee a watertight seal
and they were leaders in the field.
Every country has the right to safeguard the interests of its own
citizens. Allowing the uncontrolled influx of immigrants with few
marketable skills would obviously be madness. But Europe will have to
reach out if the tide is to be stemmed at source. The survival of
relative dolce vita depends on it.

MEDICAL and legal experts and patients' representatives hope to reach
agreement today on how far British hospitals should go in using their
patients' own blood for transfusions.
Autologous transfusion, in which the patient gets blood drawn off
regularly in the weeks preceding a pre-arranged operation, has become
popular in the US and some European countries following the infection
scares of the past 10 years.
In Britain its use is still comparatively rare, though it is available
on request. Some 200 delegates from the UK and abroad yesterday began
looking at whether the UK was out of step, and hope to arrive at a
consensus which will inform government policy.
Their conference, at the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh, is
expected to define areas in which autologous transfusion would be
beneficial, where it wouldn't, and where further research is required.
British doctors and transfusion experts now regard the risk of
infection from donor blood in this country as minimal.
Autologous transfusion has some drawbacks. Taking blood from a sick
patient over a period of four or five weeks is trickier than obtaining
it from a healthy donor; it can add #100 to the cost of an operation --
as opposed to #30-#40 for donor blood -- and if it is not used it has to
go down the sink, whereas donor blood can be on stand-by for five or six
operations.

<HEADLINE>Judge rules against homeless HIV immigrants</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Homeless EU immigrants who have no realistic prospect of finding work
and are likely to become a burden on the host state should head home
Judge Roger Henderson.
A HIGH Court judge was criticised last night after ruling that a
council was right to refuse housing to two homeless HIV-infected EU
immigrants.
In a move seen to support the Government's crackdown on ''benefit
tourism'', Deputy Judge Roger Henderson QC said the pair were not
entitled to benefit from UK laws designed to help the homeless despite
entering the country lawfully as EU citizens.
Immigrants rights groups condemned the landmark judgment as flawed and
warned it meant EU nationals could fall victim to the personal
prejudices of council officers and benefit workers. It also undermined
the rights of European nationals to cross frontiers -- rights enshrined
in EU law.
Judge Henderson said Westminster City Council acted lawfully when
officials refused to accommodate two Continental HIV victims earlier
this year.
Italian Gaudenzio Castelli, 35, and Spaniard Jose Tristan-Garcia, 32,
were not entitled to benefit from UK laws designed to help the homeless
even though they had entered the country lawfully as EU citizens, said
the judge.
He added that homeless EU immigrants found to have no realistic
prospect of finding work and likely to become a burden on the host state
''should head home''.
When the council made its decision in early summer, both men were
unemployed with no independent means and apparently no prospect of
finding work. As a result, neither had any right under EU law to remain
in the UK, said the judge.
Both Mr Castelli and Mr Tristan-Garcia claimed Westminster Council's
refusal to house them was in breach of its statutory duty under the 1985
Housing Act because of their medical condition. They have been given
leave to appeal.
A Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants spokesman said: ''The
rights of Community nationals have been thrown into jeopardy. This
ruling will allow unqualified staff to vent their prejudices against
anyone with a foreign-sounding name.''
Mr Chris Holmes, director of Shelter, said: ''If this is the correct
interpretation of the law, it is utterly outrageous and uncivilised.
What this could mean is that vulnerable people who are legally in this
country will not be given anywhere to live.''
Mr Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Aids charity the Terrence
Higgins Trust, said: ''It is disgraceful that a man with a
life-threatening illness has been released from hospital only to face
life on the street.''
Mr Castelli, a flower seller from Bergamo arrived in the UK in March
1994, hoping to start a plastic recycling business in London.
He told the council he was frustrated by his failure to achieve his
ambition, became involved in drug taking, and, after his #3000 capital
ran out, lived off friends and charity. His health deteriorated and he
went into hospital.
The judge said Mr Tristan-Garcia first came to England from Almeria,
Spain, in 1993, living with an uncle in Walthamstow and working as an
office cleaner and barman.
From February 1994, he had no paid employment and obtained income
support and housing benefit, plus a disability living allowance because
of difficulties with walking.
But then the Home Office Immigration and Nationality Department wrote
to both men saying the Secretary of State was not satisfied that they
were ''lawfully resident'' because they were not employed or ''seeking
work with a genuine chance of obtaining work''.
When Westminster Council learned of this, it decided it had no duty to
rehouse either man as they had no right of residence in the UK, having
been denied leave to remain under the 1971 Immigration Act.
The judge said: ''If EU law were to be so loosely interpreted that
member states had to allow well over a year to other member state's
nationals in poor health and with limited linguistic abilities to find
non-specialist employment, the objective of securing the free movement
of workers would in no true sense be promoted or fostered.''
Westminster is reconsidering the case of Mr Tristan-Garcia as he has
found a job after the council ruling against him. Mr Castelli will
continue to be granted temporary accommodation pending the appeal.

THE opening shots have been fired in what could soon escalate into an
all-out book price war.
The collapse last week of the net book agreement, which fixed a
minimum price for books for decades, has allowed some of the large
chains to slash the prices of bestsellers.
Independent booksellers are responding with a range of other discount
deals.
Although in the short term most retailers are predicting that more
customers will buy more books, it seems inevitable that some smaller
operations will be unable to sustain the losses from selling selected
books at less than cost price.
Waterstones was yesterday offering a ''price promise'': that if any
customer found a book priced lower elsewhere, staff would refund the
difference. It also had sizeable discounts on selected paperbacks and
hardbacks. The promise would see its having to match some of the prices
offered by stablemate, W H Smith.
John Menzies, one of the largest retailers, had 40% discounts on
certain hardback titles displayed at its outlets as well as #2 discounts
on popular paperbacks. From Monday it will also offer a bonus of five
Smart points or Air Miles for every #5 spent on books during October as
part of its new national loyalty scheme with the Shell Smart card.
Discounted hardbacks at Waterstones include Enigma by Robert Harris,
reduced from #15.99 to #11.99; Salman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh,
reduced similarly; and Len Deighton's Hope, cut from #14.99 to #10.99.
The latest Ruth Rendell paperback, Simisola, was on sale at #3.99 at
John Menzies, #4.99 at Waterstones, and at its full recommended retail
price of #5.99 at the discount bookstore Bookworld in Glasgow's St
Enoch's Centre.
The Edinburgh-based booksellers James Thin announced a special
''metric'' offer on Penguin 60s -- 12 for the price of 10.
Mr Jamie Thin, the company's price promotions co-ordinator, stated
what many of his competitors were reluctant to admit.
''There is no doubt -- this is a price war. Initially, the price
reductions will not be sustainable, but all of us retailers are
frightened of losing market share.
''For ourselves, we will be selling some books at cost and we will
probably be willing to sell below cost to retain very loyal customers.
But ultimately there has to be some sustainable level of discounting and
I am sure it will settle down.''
Mr Thin added that if a book were discounted by 25%, retailers
normally reckoned they would have to increase its sales by three and a
half times. If a book were discounted by 40% to 50%, sales volume would
have to increase by up to 10 times.
''I cannot imagine everybody buying 10 times as many books as they do
now,'' he said.
Mr Willie Anderson, managing director of John Smith and Son Bookshops,
and president of the Booksellers Association, predicted that a range of
value-added offers would appear on the shelves -- if you buy book x, you
get book y free.
His own bookshops were offering their own deal yesterday: buy three
Booker Prize shortlisted books and get another free. They also had some
discounts on selected paperbacks, diaries and road atlases.
However, said Mr Anderson, many publishers had been caught on the hop
by the decision by HarperCollins and Random House, followed shortly
afterwards by Penguin, to withdraw from the NBA. Many book stores were
therefore waiting to hear from publishers about what kind of deals might
be on the cards, he said.
The role of the supermarkets is as yet unclear.
Tesco and Safeways plan to compete, but Asda has not made a move since
the furore caused by the ending of the agreement.
The demise of the net book agreement was attributed partly to the
aggressive tactics of Asda and some other retailers in offering heavily
discounted bestsellers.

THE trial of Rosemary West at Winchester Crown Court on 10 counts of
murder -- including that of her own daughter and step-daughter -- will
get under way in earnest this morning.
Mr Brian Leveson, QC, prosecuting, will begin his opening address to
the jury.
Barristers and the judge, Mr Justice Mantell, spent the first two days
of the trial dealing with legal points, without the jury being present.
Mrs West's husband, Frederick, 53, was found hanged in a remand cell
at Winson Green Jail, Birmingham, on New Year's Day. He had been jointly
charged with his wife on the 10 murders and was in addition accused of
two other killings -- that of his first wife, Catherine, 25, and Anne
McFall, 18, a Scottish baby-minder.
Mrs West, 41, faces 10 counts of murder. She is accused of killing
Charmaine Mary West, eight, between May 1 and December 31, 1971; Linda
Carol Gough, 19, between April 1, 1973, and February 27, 1994; Carol Ann
Cooper, 15, between November 9, 1973, and February 27, 1994; Lucy
Partington, 21, between December 26, 1973, and February 27, 1994;
Therese Siegenthaler, 21, between April 13, 1974, and February 27, 1994;
Shirley Hubbard, 15, between November 13, 1974, and February 27, 1994;
Juanita Mott, 18, between April 10, 1975, and February 27, 1994; Shirley
Robinson, 18, between May 1, 1978, and February 27, 1994; Alison
Chambers, 19, between August 1, 1979, and February 27, 1994; and finally
Heather West, 16, between June 1, 1987, and February 27, 1994.

THE Crown Office has been praised for ''revolutionising'' its approach
to environmental protection issues by implementing training programmes
for procurators-fiscal to combat their lack of technical knowledge.
The plaudit came from the Scottish River Purification Boards'
Association who, for many years, have been concerned about their ability
to get pollution cases into court.
This was highlighted in their newly-published annual report when they
also expressed concern about the level of fines for offenders.
However, Professor David Mackay, general manager of the North East
River Purification Board, said yesterday that they were in a fast-moving
world and even since the report had been published things had changed
significantly.
Speaking before the start of the annual meeting and conference of the
boards' association, he said: ''The boards for many years have been
concerned about their ability to get cases into court and were seriously
hampered by the inexperience of procurators-fiscal in dealing with the
relatively rare number of pollution cases they had to handle. They
weren't really up-to-date with the law quite often.
''Secondly the sheriffs seemed to take a very, very lenient view as to
how serious an offence causing pollution is. We have often objected to
the low levels of fines being imposed.
''However, the Crown Office has really got its act together, embarked
on a very vigorous training programme with procurators-fiscal so in
future I think cases will be handled very much more competently.
''Equally the levels of fines have been climbing very steeply
recently. Some very large fines have been exerted in the last few
months. We are in a very much improving situation.
''The Crown Office have been quietly preparing themselves to
revolutionise their approach to environmental protection issues and they
have strengthened themselves in that area remarkably. They have brought
forward proposals to us within the last few weeks and we are very
impressed at what they are doing and how they intend to take the
environment process forward in the future.''
Professor Mackay said, however, that this did not necessarily mean a
rush of court cases.
A Crown Office spokesman said: ''The Crown Office takes environmental
issues seriously, reflecting society's growing concern in this area. As
part of a continuing programme to improve relations with all reporting
agencies we have increased liaison with the river purification boards
and other agencies, including the RSPB and Scottish Natural Heritage, in
order to improve the quality of reporting and to understand the
agencies' concerns. Guidance has been issued to fiscals and training has
increased in this area.''

THE row over the dearth of inward investment in the Borders continued
unabated yesterday despite a visit by Scottish Industry and Local
Government Minister George Kynoch.
Locate in Scotland has attracted 443 projects, worth more than #3600m,
over the last six years creating or safeguarding 59,995 jobs.
However not one of them was in the Borders, a region at the bottom of
the Scottish league for gross domestic product and which is heavily
reliant on the shrinking pool of jobs in textiles.
The Earl of Minto, convener of Borders Regional Council, revealed
yesterday that two sites, Cavalry Park at Peebles and Tweedbank in
Galashiels, had been on the LiS books for eight years but neither had
attracted a single approach.
''So far as this region is concerned, Locate in Scotland does not seem
to have a function which has led to anything in terms of jobs,'' he
said.
After meeting regional leaders, Mr Kynoch said that Locate in Scotland
operated in a very competitive market and the choice of actual sites was
for the investor, not Locate in Scotland.
Pressed further on what additional measures could be taken by LiS to
enhance the appeal of the Borders, Mr Kynoch bristled at what he
described as ''aggressive'' questioning by The Herald.
He said that, while every effort was made to bring investment and
spread it throughout Scotland, there was a very strong pull on
electronics firms to choose Silicon Glen for the skills and other
attractions.
Mr Kynoch urged the council to build on its successful partnership
with the local enterprise company and LiS to ensure its packages met
current needs.

LIKE the rest of us, Lynne Paton appreciates a good joke. Always
renowned for her sense of humour, she likes a laugh. Unfortunately, she
cannot -- not the way she used to anyway. Today her laugh sounds
different, more like a shriek. She can no longer speak and her body
jerks spasmodically.
Yet, despite these crippling disabilites, Miss Paton, 28, of Glasgow,
still has a twinkle in her eyes. And, with the help of a friend and
specially-devised sign language system, she has managed to win the
Gillespie Trophy for outstanding writing through disability.
Two years ago, Miss Paton suffered a severe stroke when a vein at the
base of her brain burst. She was rushed to Glasgow's Royal Victoria
Hospital in a coma. Paralysis in her lungs made breathing difficult and
surgeons at the Southern General, where Miss Paton was transferred, told
her parents, Joan and Daniel, that their only child had up to 48 hours
to live.
Mrs Paton said: ''I told Lynne she wasn't to die, that it was a stupid
notion, and we needed her here. She pulled through, thank God.''
Miss Paton, who trained as a business officer, had to be drip-fed for
more than one year through a tube in her nose. In April, she enjoyed her
first solid food -- a scoop of her favourite ice-cream.
Initially, she was completely paralysed but gradually, through intense
physiotherapy, she gained partial use of her right hand. Now she has her
full cerebral capacity back.
Her outlook has changed but the thoughts of an able-bodied woman are
still there. That was why she chose to write about her experiences with
help from a friend.
Miss Paton dictated what she wanted her friend to type by nodding her
head a certain number of times for particular letters of the alaphabet.
The whole process was painstakingly long. Her four-page essay -- which
took three months to complete -- gives painful insight into Miss Paton's
prison-like condition.

A SCHOOLBOY has helped save the day for the organisers of the World
Chestnut Championships, due to take place in Ashton, Northamptonshire,
this weekend.
Eight-year-old Johnny Harvey spent days gathering conkers in the
countryside around his home in Brookfield, Renfrewshire, after he heard
the event was threatened due to a shortage of quality chestnuts.
The organisers launched a desperate appeal for the thousand chestnuts
required to allow the competition, in its 31st year, to proceed.
The exceptional summer heatwave experienced in the Midlands has left
trees with only a few chestnuts this year.
Mr John Handiman, who has helped stage the popular event each year,
found he could only get his hands on a hundred chestnuts with just days
to go.
Armed with sticks and branches, Johnny went out to his favourite
haunts and collected 300 conkers to send south.
He said: ''My dad told me there were not enough chestnuts, but I had
plenty and decided to share them out.
''I kept a few of the big ones for myself though.''
Mr Handiman confirmed the contest would now go ahead.

MORE Scottish teenagers are smoking and there is a need for more
support for youngsters whose parents abuse alcohol, according to two
separate reports.
It was revealed at a conference in Edinburgh yesterday, that the
number of boys aged 15 classed as current smokers has risen 7% since
1990, to 27%, and among girls of the same age it has increased 8% to
30%.
Dr Candace Currie, of the health and behavioural change research unit
at Edinburgh University, said the findings of rates among young women
and young men were in line with a general trend in Western Europe.
She said there were lessons from this for countries in the former
Eastern bloc, where smoking rates were lower, particularly among girls.
''We have something which they ought to be observing, and could take
action to prevent the large increase that might occur there,'' she said.
Dr Currie, co-ordinator of a World Health Organisation study of
smoking habits among children, was addressing delegates at the European
Conference on Young People and Tobacco.
The study shows that one in five Scots boys and one in four girls aged
15 smoke cigarettes at least once a week.
Meanwhile, a plea for help for youngsters whose parents abuse alcohol,
will be made at a seminar for health and children's workers in Edinburgh
today.
Delegates will be given the results of a joint survey by children's
charity Barnardo's and the Health Education Board for Scotland, which
says help for such youngsters is vital.
HEBS programme manager George Howie said: ''It is estimated that one
in 10 adults has a problem with alcohol, so there is potential for a
huge number of children to be affected by alcohol misuse in the
family.''
While youngsters were not passive bystanders over parental drinking,
Mr Howie claimed children as young as eight were often left to act as
carers and household managers, often putting drunk parents to bed,
cooking family meals, paying household bills, and ensuring younger
brothers and sisters were safely sent to school.
Many also had to cope with the distressing effects of drink-induced
violence, even when it was not directed at them.
Mr Howie said the study had shown many children acted as a referee
between warring parents and would not leave the house, fearful of what
could happen in their absence.
The survey also showed many youngsters were verbally abused and
humiliated, and forced to collude in a conspiracy of silence about the
family problems.
Mr Hugh Mackintosh, director of Barnado's Scotland, said it was
important not to forget children when tackling adult alcohol abuse.
''While there are a number of services which support adults who are
experiencing difficulties associated with alcohol, as a child care
organisation, it is our desire to provide support for children whose
parents misuse alcohol.
''The aims of the seminar are to share the findings of the survey and
consult with professionals and families who have been affected by
alcohol, and look towards developing child-focused services,'' he said.

STUDENTS could face top-up fees for the cost of university courses
under radical plans drawn up by Government advisers.
Tory party sources confirmed policy advisers had devised a voucher
scheme to replace the existing local authority grants for possible
inclusion in the party manifesto.
The scheme, which was being put to Education and Employment Secretary
Gillian Shephard, would allow room for further expansion of higher
education, stalled because of mounting costs after a decade of rapid
growth which now sees one in three 18-year-olds going to college.
In a leaked memo to Cabinet colleagues last month, Mrs Shephard spoke
of the dangers of disappointing expectations of higher education if
growth could not be resumed.
According to a report in today's Times Higher Education Supplement,
the voucher scheme would replace local authority grants which guarantee
to meet the full cost of first degree courses.
Vouchers would be available to anyone who secured admission to a
recognised university or college but would cover only a minimum fee.
Higher-value vouchers could be available to students with high grades,
or on acceptance to higher ranking institutions. But colleges would be
entitled to require a top-up if they still fell short.
Students could borrow the top-up fee from privately financed student
loan scheme.
The report says the scheme would save #1800m a year, which would allow
the Government room to resume expansion of higher education. Extension
of student loans would be made palatable by easing the terms of
repayment.

THE first alleged Nazi war criminal to be prosecuted in Britain under
the War Crimes Act made his second court appearance yesterday.
Mr Szymon Serafinowicz, 84, a retired carpenter, of Palmersfield Road,
Banstead, Surrey, was remanded by Epsom magistrates' court to appear
again on November 2.
He is accused of murdering four unknown Jews in German-occupied
Belorussia ''in violation of the laws and customs of war, contrary to
common law''.
Mr Serafinowicz arrived for the hearing wearing a black jacket, blue
check shirt, red jumper, brown trousers and a light brown flat cap.
He listened intently as the details of his remand were read to him but
said little other than to acknowledge he understood.
His bail was renewed on condition that he does not leave the UK, does
not apply for a passport or travel document and continues to live at his
present address or at an address notified to the court and the police.
Mr Serafinowicz will face an old style committal hearing, expected to
last between six and eight weeks and involving 26 witnesses. It will be
held at Dorking Magistrates' Court.
Witnesses are expected to travel from Eastern Europe to give evidence.

STRATHCLYDE region's education authority does not have a policy in
''any shape or form'' for dealing with violent behaviour by pupils
against teachers, Scotland's biggest teaching union, the EIS, claimed
yesterday.
The union's attack came the day after 50 teachers at St Augustine's
Secondary in Milton, Glasgow, -- all EIS members -- threatened to refuse
to teach a 15-year-old boy who had been suspended for five days after
using threatening behaviour towards a teacher.
The fourth-year pupil, whose name has not been revealed by the region,
and his mother, met Mr Tom Macdougall, depute director of education
yesterday. Mr Macdougall will also meet EIS representatives on Monday to
try to resolve the issue.
The education authority had warned that the teachers could face
disciplinary action if they refused to teach the boy who had allegedly
threatened to wreck a female teacher's car and then damage the classroom
she taught in.
The Glasgow branch of the EIS yesterday claimed that the latest
incident was one of a series of threats of assaults against teachers in
the school over the past two years.
On one occasion, the union claimed, one member of staff was off work
for five weeks after being assaulted by a pupil.
The union said in a statement yesterday: ''We believe that the staff
in St Augustine's are entitled to ask the education department -- What
are you doing about this? Where is your policy on violence? Where are
there any written guidelines or advice on dealing with such threats?''
Mr Jack Collins, EIS branch secretary, said the union regarded the
matter as one of health and safety.
He claimed that the education authority had admitted it did not have a
policy for dealing with threatening behaviour against teachers ''in any
shape or form'' and had argued at a meeting earlier this week at St
Augustine's that the Health and Safety at Work Act did not apply to
schools.
Mr Collins said: ''The authority's stance is simply not good enough.''
An education authority spokeswoman would only say: ''Incidents of
violence or threats of violence are dealt with in class under
disciplinary procedures for which there are clear guidelines.''

<TEXT>
PUBLISHERS last night were trying to find Irish poet Seamus Heaney to
tell him he had won the world's most prestigious literary prize -- and a
#635,000 cash award.
The writer was on holiday in Greece, unaware he had won the 1995 Nobel
prize for literature.
Heaney, who was born in Northern Ireland, was cited by the Nobel
committee in Stockholm ''for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth,
which exalt everyday miracles and the living past''.
A spokeswoman for publishers Faber and Faber said: ''Mr Heaney is on
holiday in Greece and we are trying to contact him urgently to inform
him of his success.''
The writer will be honoured at a ceremony in Stockholm on December 10,
along with the other 1995 laureates who will be announced next week.
The academy praised Heaney, a poet, essayist, and translator, for
speaking out as an Irish Roman Catholic about violence in Northern
Ireland.
''In his opinion, the fact that there has been unwillingness on both
sides to speak out -- even about manifest injustices -- has been of
great importance in the explosive development (in Northern Ireland),''
the academy added.
Heaney, 56, is widely regarded as the most important Irish poet since
W B Yeats, who also won the prize in 1923.
Other Irish winners include George Bernard Shaw in 1925 and Samuel
Beckett in 1969.
Irish President Mary Robinson was among the first to relay
congratulations to Heaney ''for bringing great honour to Ireland''.
She said the poet's work had ''excited, enlightened, challenged and
inspired, but never disappointed''.
Irish Prime Minster John Bruton said he was delighted at the news.
Heaney had joined ''a distinguished group of Irishmen, who have been
honoured with this prize for their contribution to Irish literature in
the twentieth century''.

A SEX attacker walked free from court yesterday after a judge
suggested he need never have stood trial, had he bought his victim a
bunch of flowers and said ''sorry''.
Judge David Griffiths took the unusual step of calling the victim into
Winchester Crown Court to ask if she would accept cash compensation from
divorcee David Vaughan, 45, who had ripped her clothes off and molested
her at her home.
The judge then asked the 44-year-old woman: ''Am I right that, if the
defendant had sent you a bunch of flowers and apologised, all would have
been forgiven and forgotten?''
The woman nodded her head to this. Asked about compensation, the
nervous victim replied: ''I am not here for that. I never thought about
it.''
The judge told postal worker Vaughan, of Basingstoke, Hampshire, he
did not think he was a bad man. ''If you had had the courage and good
manners to say you were sorry and sent a bunch of flowers, all would
have been forgiven,'' he said.
Vaughan had admitted indecently assaulting the woman last November,
but his not guilty plea to attempted rape was accepted by the Crown.
He was ordered to pay the #500 compensation to the woman and #950
costs, but there was no further punishment.
Judge Griffiths' remarks provoked immediate outrage. Julie Bindel, of
the Justice for Women Campaign, called for him to retire immediately.
The victim said last night: ''All I can say is I would never go to the
police again.''

IF the Highland rail network closed down the area would lose 150,000
tourists every year, according to a report into the economic and social
impact of Highland railways published yesterday.
The study by Highlands and Islands Enterprise has been undertaken as a
basis to safeguard and develop the network.
The authors of the #30,000 report, economic consultants Pieda and
transport experts MDS Transmodal, also conclude that the network is
worth 1700 jobs and #24m to the Highland economy.
They also argue that, not only could a Motorail service to Scotland
still be feasible, it could be run at half the cost to the customer of
the one withdrawn in May.
HIE launched the report at a press conference in the Ross-shire
village of Garve.
Its chief executive, Mr Iain Robertson, said: ''We now have the
information on how important railways are to the north of Scotland.
These facts will be the heart of the economic case to retain services in
the future, but should also be used as a springboard for growth.''
At present, 250,000 tourists come to the Highlands by rail every year,
bringing #50m. However, the report found that if the network wasn't
there, 60% wouldn't come.
Dr Peter Wood of Pieda said flexibility and imagination were the keys
to growth. He said that it was quite plausible to hold a 25% increase in
rail tourism business as a medium term target which could provide an
extra 200 jobs.
''I think in the longer term the potential is even greater than we can
put a figure on at this time,'' he said.
The report makes recommendations on how best to achieve this --
recommendations which Mr Robertson admitted were well beyond his
organisation's brief.
These include: micro-franchising, where an individual line might be
run locally, either as a sub-contract from the ScotRail franchise holder
or as a separate franchise; the appointment of a rail development
officer to market and package lines; and charter trains to ferry
tourists from England using freedoms available under rail privatisation.
New working practices could see the network run with three fewer
trains, yet offering a superior service, according to the report.
However, it warned: ''A radical reassessment of staff rostering would be
required, to put the rail opportunity on an equal footing with other
modes of transport.''
Detailed recommendations on sleeper services are made: ''The
northbound sleeper can be divided at Mossend, switch to diesel, and pass
via Queen Street low level to either Fort William or a restored
Anniesland curve and Cowlairs for Inverness.
''Passenger seating stock can be added to both the Inverness and Fort
William sleeper sections at Mossend and run behind class-37 locomotives
through the day. Sleeper stock can be left during the day at Fort
William and Inverness respectively for cleaning, etc.''
On Motorail: ''This service could be combined with a 'couchette' style
sleeper train, that is, without stewards. We have calculated that, given
peak period volume, this could be done for a car price less than half
the current rates.
''Further economy might be achieved by adding Motorail wagons to
freight trains. The cars would travel with a freight train from London
to Mossend and then be united with the sleeper.''
Mr Robertson said HIE wanted to bring all the key players -- ScotRail,
Highland Region, and the Scottish Tourist Board -- together to discuss
the report. He also wanted to co-fund the appointment of a railway
development officer for the Highlands.
ScotRail's direcor John Ellis welcomed the report, but said: ''The
specific recommendations in the Pieda report concentrate on increasing
service frequencies. I am disappointed that no attention seems to have
been given to reducing journey times. This seems illogical in view of
the evident competitive pressures we face from the road network.''
Mr Ellis said he thought the section on Motorail had taken a rather
simple view of the costs, but the comments on working practices had some
validity.
The report was welcomed by the convener of Highland Regional Council,
Mr Duncan McPherson, who led the campaign to save the Fort William
sleeper.

* Fife councillors said yesterday they wanted further improvements in
some rail services in the region after the recent announcement of
Passenger Service Requirements.
The council's engineering services committee welcomed the improvements
listed in the PSR document but expressed disappointment there were still
areas where passenger requirements fell short of current services.
There was still a reduction in the number of trains from Aberdeen to
Edinburgh and the council's request for a service to stop at Springfield
had been rejected, the committee found.
It is now likely to take action through the rail working party of the
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.

STRATHCLYDE'S regional convener, Councillor William Perry, yesterday
launched Drugshield, an anti-drugs initiative calling upon all members
of the community to take action.
The campaign is targeted at the 18 to 30 age group in particular, and
asks pub, club, and disco owners to display the Drugshield logo.
However, yesterday's launch produced a sharp exchange between a
Motherwell club and pub owner and Strathclyde's Chief Constable Leslie
Sharp.
Councillor Perry had just announced his initiative when Mrs Maureen
O'Connor interrupted, attacking the criminal justice system's approach
to drugs abuse, and alleging police indifference and court leniency.
She said the people consuming drugs had to be deterred, ''those were
the people who were mugging and murdering for money to feed their
habit''.
Mr Sharp responded: ''I don't think that by taking a negative approach
we are going to make any progress. Whether or not we believe the courts
are strict enough is not my concern. What I do know is that the courts
and institutions respond to public pressure.''
He added: '' The courts are only too pleased to have the opportunity
to whack out very serious disapproval sentences in all drugs cases.
''I believe we've got to convince people like you, who are taking a
negative approach, and we've really got to believe that something can be
done''

IRISH Prime Minister John Bruton has urged the swift adoption of an
international approach to the Northern Ireland peace process.
He made the call in a New York speech to Irish-American businessmen
last night.
He added a welcome for the support of President Bill Clinton's
administration in agreeing to help remove the terrorist arms impasse
holding up the bid for peace, and underlined his government's wish for
the permanent eradication of all weapons in Northern Ireland.
His audience included Northern Ireland Office junior Minister Baroness
Denton.
''The issue is how to eliminate fear, and thereby intensify the
building of trust in a situation where we need to deal with the issue of
removing the arms from the Irish political equation and simultaneously
move to all-party round-table talks,'' he said.
Dealing with American efforts on the arms front, the Irish premier
added: ''Experience in other conflict situations has shown the value of
an external, international input in helping opposing sides face up to
the realities of the particular conflict situation in which they find
themselves.
''I believe we must now adopt this international approach in the Irish
situation, and do so speedily.''
Mr Bruton reported that recent contact between Dublin and London had
clarified their positions to the point where they could proceed
''relatively quickly'' to the establishment of an international body to
oversee arms decommissioning.

A SCOTTISH lorry driver is recovering after being hijacked at
gunpoint, beaten, tied up and robbed of his vehicle and its cargo in a
terrifying attack in Italy.
Mr Bill Duncan, 36, was asleep in the cab of his van in an isolated
depot near Imola, north of Bologna, when the three-man gang, suspected
to be part of an organised crime syndicate, attacked.
They broke into his cab at 3am and forced him out with a gun pointed
to his head. Mr Duncan, who is currently staying with his fiancee
Gillian and her mother at Newburgh, Aberdeenshire, was only wearing
boxer shorts when the gang tied him to a tree and put a bag over his
head.
He was badly beaten and then left tied up in a van which was parked in
the depot.
The gang made off with Mr Duncan's refrigerated vehicle, thought to be
worth almost #80,000, and its cargo of prime beef, worth a further
#34,000, which he was delivering for Buchan Meat Producers Ltd, of
Turriff.
Mr Duncan was found three and a half hours later when staff turned up
at the depot.
He is said to be ''extremely shaken and suffering nightmares''.
So far there has been no trace of either the vehicle or its cargo.
Mr Mike Roper, export manager for Buchan Meat, said: ''We suspect it
was highly organised. This kind of theft is not unknown but it is more
likely to happen to the south of Rome. It is much more sporadic to the
north of Rome. The vehicles are often sold or found burned out a few
days later.''

A MAN who punched a schoolboy to the ground then kicked him several
times in the face was yesterday sentenced to 150 hours' community
service.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that the assault by 21-year-old Daniel
Harvie was carried out while he was high on the drug Temazepam and was
completely unprovoked.
Harvie was on probation when he turned on the 15-year-old, who was
with two 12-year-old friends at the time.
However, Sheriff Hazel Aronson, QC, said she would give Harvie another
chance as he had spent some time on remand and is serving a prison
sentence which will end on October 27.
She said that she accepted Harvie was now off drugs and told him to
prove that his time in prison had been a salutory lesson.
''I am warning you here and now that if you fall by the wayside, if
you offend again or fail to do the community service, you will come back
before me and you can expect no leniency,'' said Sheriff Aronson.
Harvie, described as a prisoner, had earlier admitted assaulting the
boy in Bogwood Road, Dalkeith, last September 29 and committing a breach
of the peace.
The schoolboy was taken to hospital where he needed two stitches in a
cut above his eye and was treated for bruising.
Solicitor Nigel Bruce said that because Harvie had taken Temazepam he
could not recall much about the incident.
He said Harvie had previously been employed as a roofer and would have
a job to go back to when he finished his prison term.

<HEADLINE>Lloyd's Building pipes hit by severe corrosion</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976027953</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE world-famous Lloyd's Building in London is suffering from rust to
its trademark external pipes, it was revealed yesterday.
Severe corrosion is attacking the nine-year-old structure and
emergency inspection work is under way.
It is understood legal action could be taken against architect Sir
Richard Rogers and contractors Ove Arup to recoup the cost of replacing
hot water pipes where the worst corrosion has been found.
Lloyd's of London has instructed leading City law firm Herbert Smith.
Writs are likely to be issued by the end of the year and the damages
claimed would be ''substantial'', said specialist construction lawyer,
Mr Michael Davis.
A spokesman for Lloyd's said the problem was discovered during routine
inspection.
''We can confirm we will be looking to determine how we can recoup the
expenses and we cannot rule out legal action,'' he said.
The crisis over the landmark of modern British architecture, which
cost #187m to build, follows controversy over massive losses for
investors in the insurance market.
Mr Davis said: ''We will be carrying out a full review of all the
parties who were involved in the 1986 building to see who could be
remotely connected with this failure.
''Lloyd's intention is that proceedings will be commenced and I would
think that these proceedings are likely to be commenced before the end
of the year.''
Contractors Ove Arup said it could not comment on the claims, first
reported in yesterday's New Civil Engineer magazine, until the
inspection was completed.
However, the company added it was ''unfortunate Lloyd's seem to have
adopted an adversarial approach to this problem''.
Mr Martin White, company secretary to the Richard Rogers Partnership,
said he was aware Lloyd's had discovered a problem with the pipework.
However, he added: ''Investigations are taking place to ascertain the
cause of the problem. Richard Rogers Partnership do not believe that the
problem is a design problem. If proceedings are started they will be
strongly defended.''

A BOSNIAN girl, who was seriously injured in a shelling attack near
Sarajevo, was admitted to Edinburgh's Royal Hospital for Sick Children
for tests yesterday.
Six-year-old Maja Skoric was flown to Edinburgh from RAF Brize Norton,
where she and nine-year-old sister, Adrijana, and mother, Hankja,
arrived yesterday.
She will be assessed to determine her suitability for specialist
treatment on shrapnel fragment injuries inflicted in the shelling which
killed three of her friends.
The family are likely to stay at the hospital until suitable
alternative accommodation can be arranged.
Hospital trust chairman, Mr Graeme Millar, said the reputation of the
hospital and its facilities in the new surgical wing were among the
reasons why it had been asked to help.
Maja was injured three months ago. A humanitarian airlift was
organised through the United Nations when her wounds began to cause
concern because of the lack of suitable facilities for treatment in her
homeland.

A CONVICTED ''tartan terrorist'' who was jailed for 10 years for
sending a letter bomb to Lord Tebbit is now an official SNP election
agent and acted during the election for the new Glasgow unitary
authority in April.
Mr Thomas Kelly, 40, who was released in 1990 seven years into a
sentence on two counts of terrorism, acted as agent to Ms Elizabeth
Kennedy who contested the Govan ward.
Mr Kelly joined the SNP a year after his release. He became local
party secretary and assisted during the campaign after being rejected on
appeal as an official candidate by the SNP's vetting committee.
The unemployed shipyard worker was jailed in January 1984 for the
manufacture of two explosive packages, with intent to cause injury,
terror and alarm, one of which he posted to the then Trade Secretary
Norman Tebbit.
Although alleged to have been associated with the extremist Scottish
Republican Socialist Party and Scottish National Liberation Army, Mr
Kelly, of Arklet Road, Drumoyne, maintained he acted alone.
Last night he admitted he had given up hope of standing for the party
but said he planned to continue in his campaigning role.
He added: ''What I did was pointless and stupid and I regret it. But
it is not about what happened in the past, it is about what is happening
now.''
He is now also involved in a local tenants' association and community
council.
''To local people the important person is the one on the local trade
union or the campaigner outside the local school and that is what I will
continue to do,'' he said.
He said he had been ''very angry and a bit daft'' prior to his
conviction but had ''absolutely no involvement'' with current extremist
republican campaigns.
He added: ''I am a nationalist. I have always been a nationalist. The
fact I got involved in what happened in the past was simply to do with
frustration and anger and was never part of an organised terrorist
campaign.
''That existed only in the eyes of the media.''
He said that although experiencing ''abuse'' from opposition parties
he had always been open about his conviction.
He said: ''I have never hid what happened. I make a point about it.
One of the things I have found about coming out of jail is that you
can't get employment or another chance. There is nothing.''
The SNP confirmed Mr Kelly's official involvement with the party. A
spokesman said: ''The party vetting committee decided he wasn't suitable
to be a candidate, the criteria for which is a lot tighter than being an
election agent.
''The candidate is the one espousing the official views of the party.
An election agent is essentially a more administrative role.''
A Labour councillor in Govan said Mr Kelly's political involvement had
been accepted by local residents and most opposition campaigners.
He said: ''Tommy is well known in the area and people are aware of his
past. He is still very much on the left wing and very republican in
attitude.''

<HEADLINE>Stockbroker accused of #3m theft.  Doctor tells court of son's bizarre story involving the Mafia and British secret services.</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976027957</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A DOCTOR told how his homosexual stockbroker son stole investments
from him and then claimed he was forced into the theft by underworld
figures, at Snaresbrook Crown Court yesterday.
Dr Michael Gray said he found it difficult enough accepting his son
Jeremy, 27, was homosexual, let alone the fact he had taken #55,000 in
Treasury stock belonging to him.
He said that when he confronted his only son about the theft, he was
told a bizarre story which involved the Mafia, and the British secret
services.
Dr Gray said that his son had become mixed up with a series of shady
characters, alleged by the Crown as members of a Dutch homosexual ring.
He told the jury he was so concerned by his son's claims that he wrote
to the Home Office, but was met with an ''equivocal reply''.
Mr Jeremy Gray, of Clapham Common Northside, south London, denies
three charges of theft, four of false accounting, one of handling stolen
goods, and one of obtaining a false passport.
The court was told Mr Gray, a stockbroker with City firm Panmure
Gordon, transferred his father's stock to his own account.
It is then alleged he stole more than #3m worth of American
investments belonging to the British Heart Foundation, before ordering
the profits to be transferred to Swiss bank accounts.
Mr Gray did not return to work after March 1 last year, claiming he
had been diagnosed HIV positive, although he was not infected.
Dr Gray, an aviation medicine specialist employed by British Aerospace
in Saudi Arabia, said his son seemed his normal self when he spent
Christmas 1993 at the family home, Nut Cottage, Tisbury, near Salisbury,
Wiltshire.
The doctor said he flew to England on April 20 last year, when he
became worried about his son's health and discovered he had tendered his
resignation from Panmure Gordon, and was talking about ''starting
afresh'' in New York.
In a letter to his father, Jeremy Gray revealed he was a homosexual.
Dr Gray said he did not speak with his son again until September 21
last year, some three months after hearing from Panmure Gordon that he
had removed #55,000 worth of Treasury stock from his portfolio.
He said his son telephoned him in Saudi Arabia from a telephone box in
Dublin, and he had to call him back because he was penniless
''He said that his life, and the life of my wife and I, had been
threatened, and there had been threats to blow up our cottage unless he
complied with the demands made upon him.
''He was very distressed during the call, and he made it very clear
that he feared for his life.''
The doctor said his son told him: ''I'm an unwanted left-over of a
British intelligence operation, and my life isn't worth a damn.
''I had to steal because my life was threatened. It started because I
did a friend a favour.''
Dr Gray said that, according to his son, he did a ''favour'' for Mr
Richard Crofts by looking after a briefcase packed with drugs, and
afterwards various criminals and organisations became involved.
Questioned by Mr Peter Thornton, QC, for the defendant, he said he was
led to believe Mr Crofts was involved in some way with the Mafia, ''and
was wanted for crimes including drug dealing''.
Dr Gray said he took his son's fears so seriously he contacted a
friend, Brigadier Charles Wright, for help and wrote to the Home Office.
He said the brigadier urged his son to give himself up to the
authorities.
Earlier, the court was told Mr Crofts was sacked from a Dutch firm of
insurance brokers in January 1994, after he carried out a ''fraudulent
transaction'' involving a cheque for $425,000.
The trial continues.

A SHERIFF criticised prosecutors yesterday after being forced to free
a teenager who ran amok on a train and stabbed a passenger.
The knifing incident was one of 25 offences which John Baxter, 16,
admitted. However, he was sentenced to only a year's probation at
Dumbarton Sheriff Court after a fiscal downgraded the gravity of the
charges.
Sheriff Tom Scott said: ''My hands are completely tied. I am
astonished and flabbergasted to see such a catalogue of crime on a
summary complaint rather than on indictment.''
The sheriff said the maximum term he was allowed to impose was three
months. But, because Baxter had spent longer than that on remand, he had
no option but to impose probation.
Sheriff Scott said: ''It's a piece of utter nonsense.''
He told Baxter: ''You have been the fortunate recipient of
administration which I simply do not understand.''
Even defence lawyer Mr James McDonald admitted: ''I have never seen
such serious charges on a summary complaint in my career.''
The court was told that Baxter, of Turnberry Place, Dumbarton, and
another youth terrorised several passengers after boarding a train at
Craigendoran, near Helensburgh.
First, Baxter threatened Mr Lee Gowling with a knife before robbing
him of his jacket and seven pence.
Then he punched and kicked Mr James Gibb on the head and body.
Finally, he launched a vicious attack on Mr Mark Lloyd, stabbing him
repeatedly on the legs and thighs.
Baxter also pleaded guilty to a long list of other offences, including
vandalism and car theft. The Crown accepted his denials to 15 other
charges.
Mr McDonald said: ''It is my understanding that the prosecution had to
downgrade the charges because they failed to serve the original
indictment within the legal 80-day limit.''
The solicitor said that Baxter's time on remand had given him a
''short, sharp shock''. The sheriff replied: ''He needs a long, long
shock.''
Had the charges not been downgraded, the sheriff would have had the
power to impose a maximum three-year sentence -- or even ask the High
Court to deal with the matter.
* Dumbarton procurator-fiscal Christopher Donnelly said later: ''We
decided, on the merits of the case, to reduce it to summary and that was
done. I am not prepared to go into the reasons for this.''
He added: ''I can utterly refute any suggestions that we were forced
to do it for any time-bar reasons.''

A LABOUR government should ban the export of veal calves and other
live animals destined for foreign slaughterhouses, the conference agreed
yesterday.
The unanimous decision drew loud cheers at a packed debating session
where the leadership promised that Labour Ministers would ensure
''humane'' treatment of animals and allow MPs a free Commons vote on
foxhunting.
The motion backed by the conference called on an incoming Labour
government to introduce appropriate means of banning the ''cruel'' trade
of exporting animals for slaughter and calves to be raised in veal
crates which are illegal in the UK.
Shadow Agriculture Minister Dr Gavin Strang told cheering delegates:
''We must ensure humane treatment of our farm animals.
''Animals for slaughter should be exported on the hook, not on the
hoof. We will also end the export of our calves into veal crates.''
National Executive Committee member Diana Jeuda said: ''Labour will
put an end to this abuse. We will introduce licensing for hauliers, to
outlaw the cowboys.''
She was cheered when she said that a Labour Government would allow a
free vote on hunting with hounds, adding: ''I hope all MPs will vote to
ban this obscene sport.''

LABOUR would be ''dancing with the devil'' if it introduced
proportional representation and gave a coalition role to the Liberal
Democrats, a Scottish delegate told the conference yesterday.
Glasgow Pollok delegate and district councillor Alistair Watson spoke
against proposals by the party leadership to have a referendum on
electoral reform which would put the possibility of a system of
proportional representation for Westminster elections before the
electorate.
''We should all remember that to depend on the Liberals is to dance
with the devil,'' he said.
''We all remember that it was the Liberals who saved the Tory
Government from defeat over pit closures. It was also Paddy's bunch of
renegades who saved the Tories during the Maastricht debate -- so there
is no reason to suppose they would be trustworthy in coalition.''
Mr Watson said that when Labour won the next election it would be
because the people had seen it as fit to govern, not because it offered
an unwanted referendum on an issue supported only by those who saw it as
a backdoor mechanism for gaining power.
''Conference should be clear that a referendum offers a way forward
only for minorities such as the Liberals, Scottish Nationalists, and the
fascists of the BNP.
''Why should this party get into bed with the decaying corpse of
Liberalism? Such an unappealing liaison would be a natural consequence
of PR.''
The party leadership successfully avoided a potentially divisive vote
on the creation of regional assemblies in England.
The leaders want to put the issue on the back-burner if they win the
next election and have said no assembly will go ahead without prior
support of local councils and local people in a regional referendum.

PERSONAL attack alarms may be issued to students in St Andrews
following a spate of attacks on undergraduates, less than a week into
the start of the new term.
Thirteen assaults are said to have occurred already -- compared to
only 16 in the last year.
A senior Fife police official met the student welfare officer and
representatives of the university staff yesterday to discuss plans in
which extra officers will be drafted in over the next few weekends.
A spokesman for Fife police said that one concern was that from the 13
alleged assaults, only six had been reported to police, with the
remainder reported to the university.
He said: ''We recognise there is a perceived fear among students that
they may be assaulted.
''As a result, extra manpower is being made available and, should
anyone be assaulted, they should contact us immediately.''
A university spokeswoman said that consideration was being given to
issuing free alarms to its 5000 undergraduates, but said no decision had
been made meantime.
Students' Association president Mr Vincent Barnes claimed the current
level of assaults included a number of serious injuries.
He said: ''One is undergoing treatment to rebuild his cheekbone after
he was attacked.''
As a result, members were now being advised not to walk alone in town
after dark, and keep to main thoroughfares whenever possible.

the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. The working party was set up in
May to investigate ways in which the three orchestras could collaborate
to save cash.
Earlier, it emerged that the working party, chaired by Sir Lewis
Robertson, is likely to recommend that Scottish Opera disband its
52-member orchestra and instead call upon the RSNO, the chamber
orchestra and possibly the BBC orchestra.
This option was unlikely to be welcomed by Scotland's other
orchestras. The RSNO said that even allowing for the rearranging of
schedules it would be able to perform for only a couple of the eight
operas staged every year.
However, at a meeting at the Labour Party conference in Brighton
between opera director Richard Jarman, the broadcasting union Bectu, the
Musicians' Union, and the actors' union Equity, it emerged that the
opera board favours operating nine months of the year.
The solution is being put forward by the company in the face of
stand-still Scottish Arts Council annual funding of #4.7m.
Bectu said it had learnt that the SAC had accepted the opera's
decision to go part-time. The union's Gerry Morrissey described such a
decision as a betrayal of the staff and the theatre-going public. ''If
this is a tactic to get extra funding then it is inept. Scotland is a
full-time nation and needs a full-time opera.''
Musicians' Union spokesman Ian Smith said the question that had to be
asked of the arts council was whether Scotland wanted an opera company.
Equity's Scottish secretary, Lorne Boswell, said a great deal of
confusion seemed to surround Scottish Opera's finances. He said that
earlier this year it had been reported that the opera was underfunded by
#500,000 but recently that figure had been put nearer #1m. He wondered
whether the real problem lay with the company's ability to manage
itself.
But the blame for Scottish Opera's predicament was laid firmly at the
door of the Scottish Office by the Scottish Arts Lobby in Edinburgh. Mr
Eric Robinson of the group said the opera, like several other arts
organisations, was the victim of underfunding.

FEARS expressed by two surgeons that standards at their hospital in
the Highlands are falling were unfounded, it was claimed by trust chiefs
yesterday.
Management revealed a list of developments which have taken place or
are planned at Belford Hospital, Fort William, since it came under trust
control last April.
This was in the face of claims by two consultant surgeons that pleas
for development had fallen on deaf ears. The managers were backed by
another leading physician and colleague of the two.
The Highland Communities NHS Trust, which is considering redundancies
to ease a #1.8m budget deficit, was accused of not caring for the
community it serves by consultant surgeons Geoffrey Lachlan and David
Sedgewick.
They claimed the hospital, which deals with medical and surgical
services and treats mountain casualties from Ben Nevis and Glencoe, was
being allowed by the trust to fall behind appropriate standards.
A trust spokesman said: ''The trust has funded a high level of
developments at the hospital since its inception last April.''
He listed an increase in the numbers of doctors and nurses, the
construction of a postgraduate medical centre for medical and nursing
education, upgrading of the operating theatre, installation of an
electronic baby tagging security system, and the development of a
relatives room for overnight stays.
The spokesman added that more was planned, including a #1.3m upgrading
scheme and the development of a day surgery.
Senior consultant physician at the hospital, Dr Gavin Brown, added:
''More has been achieved for the hospital and Lochaber area since the
trust came into being, than was ever possible in the years of direct
management that came before.''
However, Mr Lachlan insisted: ''We fly by the seat of our pants here,
sometimes dealing with major trauma, yet we still have a good
reputation. It gets very close to the bone and one day we will be caught
out, unless there is cash pumped into developing the hospital.''

<HEADLINE>Buying Israeli ammunition 'is madness'. Shells order under attack</HEADLINE>

LABOUR last night described a Defence Ministry decision to buy 30,000
long-range artillery shells from Israel in a deal worth #40m instead of
placing the order within Britain as ''sheer madness in financial and
strategic terms''.
Royal Ordnance, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, is the prime
supplier of rifle, machine-gun, and artillery ammunition to the British
Army, although the propellant powder for its bullets already comes from
a plant in Holland.
Dr John Reid, Labour armed forces spokesman, said: ''We have
continually pressed the Government not to buy ammunition from foreign
suppliers in huge job lots and to bear in mind that most foreign
manufacturers are state subsidised. We were promised that this would be
borne in mind and that a level playing field would be established for
RO.
''This decision would appear to undermine the Government's own
procurement policy. It also raises the strategic nightmare of having
Britain dependent on the foreign policy of a foreign power for
continuity of supply. It is sheer madness.''
Senior sources in the defence sector are also deeply concerned that
not enough is being done to protect British strategic requirements in
terms of production capability and jobs, and that Government decisions
on equipment procurement are inconsistent and costly to the taxpayer.
The Defence Ministry has already signed a deal with Israel Industries'
Ammunition Group for the supply of special rounds which contain
explosive bomblets designed to saturate an area with shrapnel or
anti-tank projectiles.
The Ministry, which would supply neither details of cost or quantity,
also admitted that there was no intention to make a formal announcement
of the award of the contract.
The 155mm rounds, known as improved conventional munitions, are for
the British Army's self-propelled AS90 howitzers and FH70 towed
artillery systems.
The contract was put out to international tender under the MoD's
''value for money'' procurement policy. RO teamed up with the German
manufacturer Rheinmetall and Olin Ordnance of the United States. GIAT
Industries of France linked with the UK's Hunting Engineering, and
Israel Industries came in with a solo bid.
Concern is growing in the shrinking UK defence sector, however, that
MoD decisions, frequently taken without public announcement, may be
putting the long-term future of British companies at risk.
The UK is one of the few Nato countries which allows foreign firms to
bid for strategic orders such as ammunition. The usual procedure is to
order ''in-house'' to protect indigenous industry and to safeguard
supply in time of crisis.
The news comes one day after MoD embarrassment over tenders for the
replacement of the Army's fleet of 700 ambulances. It was rumoured that
Austrian vehicles described as ''the gold-plated version of ambulances''
were to be bought for #60m in preference to UK Land Rover versions
costing half as much.
An MoD spokesman said last night that no final decision had been
taken. ''We will be using the usual criteria of value for money for the
taxpayer and the equipment that best meets the needs of the service,''
he added. It is believed the decision may be influenced by the prospect
of losing #30m-worth of Austrian orders for radar-locating equipment and
howitzers.

GRAMPIAN'S Local Health Council yesterday received a guarantee that
treatment of patients would continue despite fears of a financial
deficit at Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trusts.
The assurance was given to Dr Kim Walker, the chief executive of the
watchdog group, when she met senior officials of Grampian Health Board
for the first time following the revelations that the flagship trust
faces a deficit of #2m in the coming year. She said she was told there
was no financial crisis.
''They said that although the contract with the trust had not yet
technically been signed, all the money is being transferred and the
patients are being treated.
''They said there is no question that patients will not be treated or
can't have an out-patient appointment.''
Yesterday, the health union Unison supported the suggestion by
consultants that the deficit was caused by Government underfunding.
''These revelations by staff confirm Unison's view that the Tories and
their internal market march towards eventual privatisation are proving
to be the ruin, not only of themselves, but also of the trusts,'' said
Mr Ken MacMillan, Unison's regional officer.

<TEXT>
A HOSPITAL patient was under armed police guard last night after being
shot by a man who, dressed as a clown, bluffed his way into the building
with a sawn-off shotgun hidden in a bunch of flowers.
Police said the gunman clearly knew the man was being treated in St
Andrew's Hospital, Billericay, Essex. After blasting him in the shoulder
at point-blank range, the gunman disappeared leaving no trace.
Police would not give any details about a motive for the shooting,
which happened as the 26-year-old patient was standing outside his
private room in Villerica ward where he is being treated for acid burns
received in August when he was abducted outside a telephone box in
Essex.
Detective Chief Inspector Wilson Kennedy, leading the inquiry, said:
''We are treating this as attempted murder. It was obviously a concerted
effort to kill the gentleman.''
The gunman is described as white, 6ft 4in, slim, and muscular with
broad shoulders and short, dark hair. He was wearing a clown's wig with
a pink forehead, a big red nose, and a set of fake Dracula teeth.
Detectives said hospital staff believed the man could have come from a
kissogram agency. The ward is near the children's ward in the hospital,
which is a specialist unit for burns victims.
Mr Kennedy said the gunman asked staff for directions to the ward and
gave the patient's name.
The victim has been undergoing treatment since the abduction in
Purfleet in August when two men sprayed acid in his face, bundled him
into the boot of their car, and dumped him in Dangenham half-an-hour
later.
''After this attack, he refused to co-operate with us about the
motive. We hope to speak to him later about this attack,'' Mr Kennedy
added.
The man had not apparently received any threats while in hospital.
Plans to have a guard on him had been dropped after discussions between
the victim and police.
Hospital staff were being helped by stress counsellors while police
continued to search the 26-acre grounds for any signs of the man.
Mr Chris Minett, chief executive of Mid Essex Hospital Trust, said
security arrangements at the hospital had not been breached but a review
would be carried out following the shooting.
The victim comes from south-east Essex but police would not say
whether he was known to them.
Mr Kennedy said: ''When they abducted him, they had him for 30 minutes
and had plenty of time to have killed him then. I can't say why he was
shot.''
The victim underwent emergency surgery at St Andrew's to remove
pellets. His condition is not life threatening.
Staff at St Andrews were warned not to give any details of the injured
man who is still recovering from emergency surgery.

A BRITISH peacekeeper shot dead a Bosnian Army soldier in self-defence
yesterday, the United Nations said.
The incident, in the village of Rudina in the centre of the country,
occurred after the Bosnian soldier threatened the peacekeeper by placing
a pistol to his head.
''The British soldier then shot the Bosnian soldier, who dropped his
pistol,'' said Major Myriam Sochacki, a UN spokeswoman in Sarajevo.
''The Bosnian then tried to retrieve his pistol and the British
soldier, fearing for his life, fired two more shots, killing him.''
Major Sochacki said the peacekeeper had been guarding a Saxon armoured
vehicle from which other British soldiers had dismounted when the
Bosnian approached him in an agitated manner.
She said UN and Bosnian Army authorities were investigating the
shooting. -- Reuter.

A PARTNERSHIP involving the National Galleries of Scotland and Glasgow
Development Agency has submitted an official bid of #3m for the post
office building in George Square, Glasgow -- bringing plans for a new
gallery of Scottish art and design one step closer.
The deadline for official bids passed on Wednesday. A spokesman for
the Royal Mail said there had been several bids but added he could not
release any further information.
The GDA confirmed that it had submitted a bid on behalf of the
National Galleries and with the backing of Glasgow City Council but
would not comment further.
However, The Herald understands an offer of #3m was made -- the price
of the building said to have been set by the district valuer.
The money would be raised through European sources and National
Lottery funding.
Mr Mungo Campbell, galleries project adviser for National Galleries of
Scotland, said last night: ''We are aware that an offer has been made by
the GDA, with which we are associated.'' A decision on the sale will be
made within the next two weeks.
The Royal Mail spokesman said future uses of the building would be
taken into account when considering the bids.
He said: ''We will look at each offer in its entirety. We are
publicly-owned but we do have commercial responsibilities and have to
look at the best possible return on the building.
''But we will also look at things other than price, such as what
funding is in place and what the building will be used for. A decision
is likely within the next two weeks.''
He added that the building would not necessarily go to the highest
bidder and a range of factors would be taken into account.
The National Galleries has earmarked the building as its preferred
option for a new gallery of Scottish art. It is hoped that the gallery
project, which would ultimately cost up to #30m, will be completed in
time for the Year of Architecture and Design in 1999.
Last month GDA chairman Mr Michael Lunn wrote to the Royal Mail saying
the art gallery project provided a ''once in a lifetime opportunity''
for Glasgow and Scotland. He urged that the building be kept in the
public domain. It has also been touted as a possible site for prestige
office development.
A new #26m postal sorting centre in Springburn prompted the sale of
the George Square building.

Andrews University's Gatty Marine Laboratory.
Fifteen staff will move to St Andrews from the Natural Environment
Research Council's sea mammal research unit (SMRU) in Cambridge and will
be housed in a #2m extension to the Gatty Marine complex.
The St Andrews development, which is scheduled to open next year, will
include a 40-metre long tank for studying seals in controlled

Dr Philip Hammond, who has moved to St Andrews in advance of the rest
of the SMRU group, said yesterday: ''The excellent new facilities and
the active research environment at the Gatty will enable the unit to
realise its full potential as a world-class centre of excellence.''

POLICE have issued an urgent appeal to the public for help in tracing
a man who indecently assaulted a 79-year-old woman after breaking into
her home in Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, early yesterday.
The woman, who has not been named, was alone in her home in Argyle
Street when the man entered the house and attacked her before leaving
about 5.35am when she raised the alarm.
Detective Chief Inspector Jeanette Joyce, who is leading the inquiry,
said: ''This was a truly horrible attack on an elderly woman in a place
where she should have felt safe. Luckily, she has not been physically
harmed but she is extremely distressed by what has happened and is
finding it hard to give us details. We have not established why the man
broke into the house in the first place.
''People should not panic unnecessarily but while he is on the streets
there must be cause for concern.''
She appealed for anyone who was in the Argyle Street area of
Alexandria early yesterday between 3am and 5.45am to contact the police
as soon as possible.
Ms Joyce added: ''No matter how unimportant you think your information
is, please contact us.''

SCOTLAND'S biggest teachers' union yesterday condemned the
Government's proposed nursery voucher scheme as expensive, disruptive
and unpredictable in its effects.
The Educational Institute of Scotland said that there was no support
north of the Border for the introduction of the scheme which would give
parents of four-year-olds #1000 worth of vouchers to pay for nursery
education.
Pre-school provision should take the form of additional high-quality
nursery education provided by education authorities and subject to
school inspectors, the union said.
It made clear its views in a six-page response to a Scottish Office
consultation paper on pre-school education.
Mr Fred Forrester, deputy-general-secretary of the EIS, said if the
scheme was introduced it would collapse under the weight of
impracticality and in the process public funds would be wasted.

A HOSPITAL executive who stars on the front page of her trust's latest
newsletter was stunned to discover that her next appearance would be on
a list of redundancies.
Mrs Fiona McTeague is one of 22 management staff axed by the Victoria
Infirmary, Glasgow, in an attempt to staunch a deficit believed to be
currently about #700,000. The trust started the financial year #1.7m in
debt, one of its directors admitted last night.
The current issue of the Victoria Newsbeat carries Mrs McTeague's
picture under the headline Trust Triumphs!, describing the Victoria's
success in obtaining a seal of approval from the King's Fund quality
audit.
The King's Fund Institute is an independent think tank which sends in
teams of experts to inspect the running of hospitals against a range of
nationally-set standards.
Mrs McTeague was the co-ordinator of the project which ensured the
Victoria received provisional two-year accreditation from the fund. The
Newsbeat article quoted the fund as praising the ''excellent'' work that
had gone into ensuring compliance with their recommendations.
Mr Jim Devine, regional officer of the health union Unison, said last
night: ''This is supposed to be a caring profession, yet this woman was
called into her boss's office on another pretext, thinking she might be
getting a pat on the back for her efforts. Instead she was told she was
losing her job.''
Mrs McTeague is one of three women named in the newsletter -- the
others, editor Mrs Mary Hilton, who is out-patient services manager, and
Medical Records manager Mrs Anita Wilson, have also been made redundant.
Mr Devine and fellow union officers will meet the Victoria management
this morning to discuss the redundancies, and will be pressing concerns
that the redundancies could cost as much as the savings they are
intended to effect.
''We have been told that one manager alone could qualify for #150,000
severance, and have calculated that the redundancy payments will be as
much as the savings. We have also been told if the trust makes these
people redundant before November the Scottish Office Health Department
will pick up the bill for the redundancies,'' Mr Devine said.
''That may allow the Victoria to keep the savings, but as a taxpayer I
am appalled at our money being used in this way; I wonder if the trust
board members are aware of the resentment this is causing in the
hospital.''
A Scottish Health Department spokesman said: ''I cannot discuss the
specific case of the Victoria Infirmary but in general it is the
employing authority which is responsible for the payment of
redundancies.''
Mrs McTeague, Mrs Hilton and a third executive, Corporate Planning
Manager Mrs Irene McKie, have been invited to compete for a new post of
Patient Services Manager.
Mr Raymond Cowie, Director of Human Resources and Operations, said
last night that the hospital had started this financial year with a
deficit of #1.7m.
''We have brought this down and we anticipate that the redundancies
would reduce it further to #450,000. I can't say at this stage what the
cost will be because we are seeking volunteers in some areas and it
depends on their service and pay levels,'' he said.
''However, the savings will continue year-on-year, so that at the
start of the next financial year in March the deficit will be about
#88,000. I am not aware of any arrangement with the Scottish Office for
them to meet the severance costs. That would not be normal practice.''

HEALTH unions reacted furiously yesterday to a 15% pay increase for a
hospital trust manager.
Monklands and Bellshill Hospital Trust chief executive, Mr Jim Currie,
has seen his pay rise to #68,000 -- an increase of #9000 on the previous
year.
The package, made up of salary, pensions, and fees, was revealed in
the trust's annual report.
It came as union leaders battle to secure agreement with trust
managers over their 3%pay claim, and amid claims that midwifery services
at the trust are understaffed.
Last night, the pay increase was condemned by both the Royal College
of Nursing and Royal College of Midwives.
RCN spokeswoman Carrie Ferrier said: ''This is unacceptable for the
vast majority of our members. Nurses are finding it harder and harder to
understand how salaries like this can be justified in the present
climate.
''We are struggling at the moment to achieve a 3% rise with no strings
from this trust. This will have a devastating effect on morale.''
An RCM Lanarkshire branch spokeswoman said: ''This is absolutely
deplorable. We have discussed this pay packet at branch level and it has
been roundly condemned.
''We are also concerned that midwifery staffing levels in this trust
are fairly low. Our members believe staffing levels should be
significantly higher.''
Airdrie MP Helen Liddell (Monklands East) said: ''I have been talking
to the trust recently about staff relations, and this does not seem a
way of cementing them.
''It would be perfectly understandable if the nurses feel they have
been slapped in the face. I am surprised that the trust can be so
insensitive.
''I don't cast any doubts on the chief executive's ability, but I am
sure the nurses will not be happy about the difference in pay rises.''
Only a few weeks ago, the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Michael
Forsyth, asked the Management Executive of the NHS to take a ''hard
look'' at how the salaries of all 47 health trust chief executives are
to be calculated in future, according to a Scottish Office spokesman.
The first draft of that review is expected on the Minister's desk
within days.
''Mr Forsyth has said he wants a hard-hitting review of how things are
worked out in future and wants salaries to be sensitive, transparent,
and relating to patient care,'' added the spokesman.
A spokesman for the trust said Mr Currie's rise had been determined by
its remuneration committee which is made up from non-executive
directors. He added that it complied with the guidelines laid down by
the Scottish Office.
He said Mr Currie would not comment on his salary.

THE warmth of feeling between the Duke of Edinburgh and his eldest
grand-daughter Zara Phillips was obvious yesterday on a visit to
Gordounstoun School.
After shaking hands with official dignitaries and Peter Phillips, the
Duke lent over and kissed Zara, 14, on the cheek. Meanwhile, when the
Queen shook hands with Peter, he grinned and said: ''Hi gran.''
The Princess Royal's children took great delight in showing where they
live and study to their grandparents, who had driven to the Morayshire
school from Balmoral.
School sources refused to reveal whether Peter had removed his
favourite posters -- of Pamela Anderson -- from his bedroom walls.
Later, the Queen watched as her grandson led a team of the school's
firefighters through a display. Peter is head of Gordonstoun's fire
service. The school's two fire engines are part of Grampian Fire
Brigade's retained service and regularly turn out at fires -- the latest
a kitchen blaze at Hopeman on Wednesday afternoon.
Meanwhile, Braveheart star Mel Gibson has agreed to join a campaign to
prevent Prince Edward being elected as honorary president of Stirling
University Students' Association -- the equivalent of rector.
When nominations closed earlier this week, only two candidates had
agreed to have their names put forward for election -- the actor Prince,
who was nominated by the head of the university's drama society, and a
mature sociology student, Mr Ben Goodwin, of Tullibody.
Yesterday, the editor of the student newspaper Brig, Mr Derek Lambie,
said that Gibson had agreed to stand but his nomination papers had not
arrived in time. The actor would now support the paper's campaign for
students to vote for neither the Prince nor Mr Goodwin but mark their
papers ''RON'', which means ''re-open nominations'', forcing a fresh
election.

FORMER Chancellor Norman Lamont last night received another setback in
his attempt to find a Commons seat at the next election.
Mr Lamont -- whose Kingston upon Thames seat disappears under the
boundary changes -- failed in his bid to gain the nomination for the
newly merged Kingston and Surbiton seat.
The local constituency party voted as expected for the sitting
Surbiton MP, Mr Dick Tracey, to be their prospective parliamentary
candidate.
After the meeting, Mr Lamont said: ''Obviously I am disappointed to
have lost, but I have no regrets about putting my name in for the
nomination.''
He said he had decided to stand for the seat after being urged to by
activists in Kingston.
''I felt I would have let them down if I hadn't. I knew the risks. But
that's democracy.
''I will continue to look for a seat in Parliament. It is my wish to
continue in public life,'' he said.
He did not believe his disloyalty to the Prime Minister -- voting
against the Government in a crucial Europe vote and backing Mr John
Redwood for the party leadership -- had cost him the nomination.
''I don't think that had anything to do with it whatsoever. I think it
is the fact that the greater part of the new constituency comes from
Surbiton,'' he said.
After making his address to the meeting, Mr Lamont, accompanied by his
wife, Rosemary, left in a chauffeur-driven Daimler.
They returned an hour later for the result, only to suffer the
indignity of finding themselves locked out.
Surrounded by camera crews, they had to beat a hasty retreat to the
car before being taken in by a back entrance.
Mr Tracey, a Sports Minister under Margaret Thatcher, has been MP for
Surbiton since 1983, holding the seat with a majority of 9639 at the
last election.

A HEALTH trust chief executive has expressed his ''hurt and
disappointment'' at criticism of possible private finance for a new
community hospital at Cumnock.
Mr Hugh Sutherland, of the Ayrshire and Arran Community Health Care
NHS Trust, was responding to criticism from local MP George Foulkes, who
claimed his constituents were being ''double crossed'' over plans for
the hospital.
Last week, the trust won a contract from Ayrshire and Arran Health
Board to build a 74-bed community hospital at a cost of #8.6m, and to
run it for around #3.4m a year.
An unsuccessful bid to redevelop a site at Ballochmyle Hospital near
Mauchline, backed by Mr Foulkes, was made by the South Ayrshire
Hospitals NHS Trust.
A statement from Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Scottish Office Health
Minister, that the building would be subject to the private finance
initiative, provoked a furious response from Mr Foulkes, who said there
was ''dirty work at the crossroads'' involving the trust and the health
board.
However, Mr Sutherland said yesterday that local people had nothing to
fear and that private finance, should it become involved, would only be
for the construction of the building.
He added: ''We are bound to get the best value for money for the
people of our area, and that may involve looking at the possibility of
private finance for the building. I would stress that this is only for
the bricks and mortar, and that the hospital will be staffed and
operated by NHS people.
''We are not builders, we are health care providers, and what we want
is the best possible building at the most competitive price and in the
shortest possible time, so that we can get on with the job of providing
health care.
''This has been a great week for a hard working team of people, and I
am hurt and disappointed that anyone should cast doubt on the project in
this way.''
Dr Ian Christie, a Cumnock GP and member of the project board which
set the criteria for the new hospital, said: ''There was always a
possibility that private finance would be sought, whoever won the
contract, to build the hospital.''

THE Queen suffered bruising when she was hit by a plummeting bird shot
on a Balmoral grouse shoot, it emerged last night.
The shot grouse hit the Queen's shoulder with some force during a
shoot two weeks ago.
Buckingham Palace confirmed the incident which happened when the Queen
and her guests were walking with the shoot.
''A shot bird spiralled from the sky on a misty morning and brushed
off the Queen's shoulder,'' said a Palace spokesman.
''The shoulder was bruised but there was no serious damage and the
Queen carried on. She has been riding since.''
The Queen is due to return to London at the end of her annual Scottish
holiday on Monday.

THE CONSTRUCTION industry yesterday delivered another demolition blow
to the Conservatives when one of its leading figures declared the
Government had done nothing to help builders for several years.
Sir Clifford Chetwood, chairman of the Construction Industry Training
Board and a former chairman of Wimpey, warned of a ''total lack of
confidence'' among builders and the public in the Government's ability
to meet their needs.
He added: ''The only way the Conservative Party will wake up to the
fact that this industry has teeth is for us to bite them.''
That was a reference to the decision earlier this week by Britain's
biggest plant hire group, Glasgow-based Hewden Stuart, to refuse a
request for a donation to the Scottish Tories.
Sir Clifford was speaking exclusively to The Herald during a visit to
Glasgow to mark the 20th anniversary of the CITB's training centre at
Hillington.
He said he had warned the Government in 1989, while he was president
of the Building Employers' Confederation, that the housing boom was
ending and that the construction industry in general was about to go
into recession.
''That recession has never gone, that is six years now that we have
had a recession in this industry,'' said Sir Clifford.
''I feel very strongly that, as an industry, since 1989 we have had no
assistance whatsoever from this Government in the way of workload or an
awareness of the very large unemployed figures that we have carried. At
peak, we had 600,000 unemployed in this industry, and even now there are
some 500,000 who are still seeking work.''
Sir Clifford said insufficient workload had in turn meant inadequate
opportunities to train young people.
''We, as an industry, are in serious decline. The Government, in my
opinion, has done little to alleviate the problem. They have done it for
other industries, but they have totally ignored the construction
industry.''
As reported yesterday, the board of Hewden Stuart decided earlier this
week to turn down a request from the Scottish Conservative Party for a
donation.
The company usually makes an annual donation, which last year amounted
to #7500. A specific grievance the company currently has with the
Government is the fact that the plant hire industry has to pay a much
higher tax than the agricultural industry on a virtually identical type
of vehicle.
The company's decision is especially embarrassing for the
Conservatives because Hewden Stuart's previous chairman, Sir Matthew
Goodwin, is a prominent Tory figure who has held offices including
honorary treasurer and joint deputy chairman of the Scottish
Conservative Party.
Yesterday, chairman Sandy Findlay stressed that Sir Matthew had not
been involved in the board's decision to refuse the request. The request
had not been considered formally until this week's board meeting, held
to approve the company's half-year figures.
Mr Findlay said the matter had been considered ''fairly briefly'' and
that the board felt ''it was not appropriate to make a donation at this
moment in time''.

<HEADLINE>Sixty days to find peace for Bosnia. US envoy clinches ceasefire.</HEADLINE>

THE sudden agreement of a 60-day ceasefire in Bosnia could finally see
the end of its three-year-war.
The truce, unexpectedly announced by US President Bill Clinton in
Washington yesterday, is set to take effect in five days. It has been
agreed by the warring factions.
The end of the fighting will be followed by peace talks between the
parties in the US, set to begin around October 25, and a full-scale
international peace conference in Paris.
Mr Clinton said the breakthrough had emerged from shuttle diplomacy by
the US Assistant Secretary of State, Mr Richard Holbrooke, who has been
working for weeks as a peace envoy in the area.
He welcomed the deal as ''an important moment in the painful history''
of the former Yugoslavia, but added: ''We need to be clear-eyed about
this. It matters what the parties do, not just what they say.''
His National Security Council officials said the ceasefire would
become effective at one minute past midnight on October 10 provided full
gas and electrical service is restored in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo.
If the power is not back on in time the ceasefire will start on the
day after it is restored.
Mr Major said: ''The door to peace is now open. The ceasefire should
pave the way for the conclusion of a permanent political settlement.''
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, while warning against ''wild
optimism'', added: ''The long agony of the Bosnian war may now soon be
over.''
He said that consideration would now have to be given by the
international community to the establishment of a ''peace implementation
force'' to secure the ceasefire.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said he thought it would be
respected by both government and Bosnian Serb troops. ''I think this is
a serious agreement and we will respect it. I think the Serb side has
the interest in respecting it too,'' he said.
However, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, while stating the Serbs
were ready to honour their side of a ceasefire agreement, said it was
too early to celebrate an end to the war. He said they would not accept
any peace map based on gains made by the Muslim-led government army
helped by Croat forces in a big offensive last month.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, praising the ceasefire, said Moscow
planned to resume gas supplies to the former Yugoslav republic.
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali also welcomed Mr Clinton's
announcement.
In the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka, soldiers and civilians
reacted with a mixture of joy and scepticism.
One young Serb soldier said: ''All the soldiers in the battle areas
have been longing for this. We just want the fighting to stop.''
News of the agreement came as Britain announced, in an unrelated move,
that it was scaling down its military presence with the withdrawal of
3300 troops of the 24 Air Mobile Brigade.
The order to pull out the troops, based in Ploce in Croatia, followed
a reassessment by the commanders of the UN Protection Force of their
forces' deployment, which resulted in some units being declared no
longer necessary.
There nevertheless remain 8000 British personnel in the area,
including 5000 ground troops, and Mr Major stressed that Britain would
continue to play a major role in the region.
Mr Holbrooke broke the news of the deal in a telephone call to Mr
Clinton after a final meeting in Sarajevo with President Izetbegovic.
Under the terms of the ceasefire, all parties are to ensure that all
military commanders will issue orders barring offensive operations. All
sniper fire and laying of mines are to cease.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair and BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance last night
confirmed they had an ''understanding'' which would enable the
communications giant to expand into the high-tech home entertainment
market if Labour won power.
In return, BT would connect schools, libraries and hospitals free of
charge to the computer superhighway.
Sir Iain, in his statement, said there was no ''deal'' as such between
BT and the Labour Party. But there was an understanding that if Labour
won power it would adopt the unanimous recommendations of the Commons
Trade and Industry Select Committee on allowing BT and Mercury to
compete with the cable monopolies.
Mr Blair had earlier outlined the agreement in his speech to the
Labour Party conference in Brighton at which, somewhat bizarrely,
Thatcherite hate-figure Lord Tebbit arrived as a hero.
Old Labour stars like Tony Benn and Dennis Skinner could only watch
bemused as Lord Tebbit and Tony Blair lined up against the Government on
the BT arrangement.
The Tebbit/Blair alliance on a capitalist issue will leave the
Government in difficulties with the Tory party in Blackpool next week.
Lord Tebbit was the Cabinet Minister who privatised British Telecom and
is now a non-executive director.
The superhighway plan was the highlight of Mr Blair's conference
speech and the Tories set out to rubbish it. Mr Ian Lang, President of
the Board of Trade, declared that such a deal was not possible and that
it would be counter-productive to Tory competition policy.
''Competition and choice best serve the customer, and not private
sweetheart deals with one company that undermines the others and
restoring the monopoly that we have been steadily removing in this
industry.''
But Lord Tebbit rebutted this sharply. The Blair/BT agreement would be
good for the country and the hospitals, schools, and libraries. He
accused the Government of ''being more comfortable projecting the huge
American companies coming into this country''.
If the welcome for Lord Tebbit at Brighton was something of a record
for New Labour, it was not the only one. Not once in four days has the
Labour leadership suffered a voting defeat on great issues of policy.
Sir David English, chairman of Associated Newspapers, scourge-in-chief
of the Labour Party, has announced in a Spectator article that both he
and his proprietor, Lord Rothermere, are considering the ''unthinkable''
-- recommending their readers to vote Labour at the next election.
These events were almost too much for socialists to take in yesterday,
but their confidence is high.
Their leader on ITV last night urged them to maintain their discipline
for the battle to come which he described as one between ''hope and
fear''. Former Tory voters have still to come to trust the Labour Party.
While these bizarre developments unfolded, the party meekly endorsed
every policy presented to it. At long last, by a 55% to 45% vote,
unilateral nuclear disarmament was ditched, almost unnoticed. There was
no challenge to bi-partisan Northern Ireland policy. Even Shadow Home
Secretary Jack Straw, who has been rather right wing on crime recently,
got through smoothly.
The Prime Minister, whose party may be uniting behind him, has a new
problem. His adversary Mr Blair has shown himself to be an able orator
and party manager. Now he has come up lucky.

TONY Blair delivered an astonishing rebuke to the Scottish TUC
yesterday, accusing it of immaturity in opposing Labour's plans for the
make-up of a Scottish Parliament.
The Labour leader stunned political observers by taking such a harsh
line with the STUC, normally regarded as a firm ally of the Labour Party
in Scotland. In no mood for conciliatory gestures, he bluntly told the
STUC it was not very mature to rush around issuing threats.
He also emphasised that Labour would make the final decision itself on
future plans for a Scottish Parliament.
His uncompromising stance will overshadow the meeting of the Scottish
Constitutional Convention in a fortnight's time, when the final details
of a future parliament will be decided. It had been hoped that the
Convention -- which has the support of Labour, the Scottish Liberal
Democrats, the STUC, local authorities and community groups -- could
reach agreement and show a united front.
Mr Blair's tough intervention will make that far more difficult.
The row is over how many members a Scottish Parliament should have.
Labour and the Scottish Liberal Democrats have both compromised their
earlier positions by agreeing on 129. The STUC said this figure is too
low to reach the objectives of a parliament of true proportionality and
gender equality.
Mr Blair then came out with his broadside. He said of the STUC: ''I
think they should have the maturity and sense to realise that, although
the Labour Party will, of course, listen to what they have to say,
nevertheless we will make the final decision ourselves as to what is the
best way forward.
''I don't think it is either sensible or very mature to rush around
issuing threats that, if this or that doesn't happen, they are going to
take this or that action. That's not the way to do business with us at
all.''
Stung by the criticism, Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the
STUC, said they did not need lectures on maturity, as an organisation
which acted as a midwife to the entire process of creating a Scottish
Parliament.
He retorted: ''Of course we will show maturity. We have been involved
since the beginning of the Convention and have played an important and
mature role in keeping things together. But that doesn't mean that we
will always agree with a particular position that has been advanced. If
our democracy isn't mature enough to allow people to have differing
points of view and seek to come together, then it is a very shallow
democracy.''
Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, commented: ''It is arrogant in the
extreme for Tony Blair to tell Campbell Christie to show more maturity.
Campbell Christie has forgotten more about the Scottish constitution
than Tony Blair has ever learned.''
Meanwhile, attempts will continue to convince the STUC before the
crucial Convention meeting on October 20.
Mr Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said:
''Gender balance will only be achieved if the parties put their weight
behind trying to achieve it. I can assure the STUC that we will be
sincere and earnest in our efforts to get that gender balance within our
own parliamentary party.''
