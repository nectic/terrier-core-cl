AS Scotland shivered, the coldest place of all was Altnaharra, a hamlet in the
Highlands.
An early-morning temperature reading of -23C shot the group of 20 houses and a
hotel in the middle of Sutherland into the national spotlight yesterday.
The village lies 23 miles North of Lairg on the single-track road to Tongue, on
Sutherland's north coast.
Yesterday, postmistress Lesley Wilkie told how she, her farm manager husband
Alan, and youngsters Gillian and Keith feared they would not make it home when
the fierce blizzards struck on Christmas Eve after a shopping trip to Lairg.
However, super-chilled temperatures are nothing new to self-made Scots
millionaire Jim Gray, 55, who owns the 36,000-acre Altnaharra Estate, which
gives year-round employment to Alan Wilkie and to two gamekeepers.
Mr Gray is joint founder of Gray and Adams, the company based in Fraserburgh,
Aberdeenshire, Britain's leading manufacturer of freezer lorry trailers.
His company, which he started from scratch in 1957, now employs 300 at their
Fraserburgh factory, while a further 300 work at their manufacturing plants in
Dunfermline, Yorkshire, and Northern Ireland.
Mr Gray said: ``Minus 23? There's nothing new about that for me. That is
exactly the temperature at which the articulated wagons we make carry frozen
food from Europe to supermarkets throughout Britain.''
He bought the Altnaharra Estate from Lord Kimball, formerly Tory MP Sir Marcus
Kimball last year ``as a place for a bit of relaxation away from business
pressures''.
Although he lives at Memsie, near Fraserburgh, the self-made tycoon frequently
travels to Altnaharra for salmon angling.
There are eight youngsters at single classroom Altnaharra school run by under
headmistress Mrs Anne Mackay.
The 20-bedroom Altnaharra Hotel has recently been completely refurbished by its
Danish owners Anne and Daniel Tuscher.
Postie Alistair Mackay brings the mail to Altnaharra every day from Lairg
around lunchtime and he also delivers milk and daily newspapers to the folk in
the scattered community.
Altnaharra was luckier than many other remote communities in that its power
supply was only cut for eight hours on Christmas Eve.
Mr Wilkie looks after the hill farm with its flock of 1200 sheep. There are
also around 100 arable acres close to the village, which supports a herd of
Irish cattle.
The Wilkies have been in Altnaharra for three years. Previously, Alan worked on
a farm at Insch, Aberdeenshire. Lesley's pride and joy are her three horses - a
thoroughbred mare, a prize-winning Connemara pony, and a Shetland pony.
Yesterday, she said: ``This is definitely the coldest weather I have ever
experienced. It is bitter but the sun is shining and thankfully there is hardly
any wind, so it is bearable. Living in Altnaharra took a bit of getting used to
but we are all very happy here now, despite all the frost and snow.''

SCOTLAND'S 430 front-line ambulances are to be equipped with sophisticated new
machines to help save heart-attack victims.
The #1m, state-of-the-art defibrillators use an electric current to re-start
the heart.
They are part of a #2.5m package for the Scottish Ambulance Service announced
yesterday by Minister of State for Scotland Lord James Douglas-Hamilton on a
visit to its headquarters in Edinburgh.
The rest of the package comprises #900,000 for new vehicles, #300,000 on a new
ambulance station for Clydebank, and #250,000 to complete the service's command
and control system across Scotland.
The new defibrillators will replace existing equipment.
Lord James said they would enable the service to continue to play a vital role
in the battle to reduce death from heart disease in Scotland.
The new Clydebank station is to be fully-operational by the end of next June,
will help the service to maintain good ambulance response times.
Lord James said that last week he and Scottish Office officials had discussed
how best to redistribute #13m of capital resources which had been identified
through monitoring of slippage and capital schemes.
He had realised the benefits to be gained from approving funds for the key
developments in the ambulance service.
A Scottish Office spokesman said Lord James had talked to ambulance staff
during yesterday's visit.
Two paramedics told him they used the defibrillators three or four times a
month and assured him that they were life-savers.

LABOUR was asked yesterday to explain where the long-term funding would come
from for the training programme for unemployed under-25s announced last autumn
by Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown.
Employment Minister James Paice asked what funding would replace the proceeds
of the windfall tax on the privatised utilities which was to launch the
programme. As a windfall tax was by definition a one-off, who would pay in the
second and subsequent years?
Mr Paice also inquired how much of the tax would be available for funding the
programme, as Opposition spokesmen, he calculated, had pledged 11 new spending
programmes that were to be paid from it.
He also raised the question of young people in the scheme pricing others out of
jobs, since employers, offered #60 a week for six months to take them on, might
substitute them for other workers.
The Minister pressed Labour to make it clear if the scheme would be compulsory.
At the launch, Labour indicated that those who failed to take up a job offer
would have a proportion of their benefit cut.
Remarks by Shadow Employment Secretary Michael Meacher in a television
interview that the scheme might offer more to employers than employees showed
he was ``embarrassed'' about it, said Mr Paice.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways yesterday launched its own January sales and opened the way for
a new fare war with rival Virgin.
BA slashed prices on almost 100 routes from Brussels to Brisbane for anyone
booking by January 17.
The January sales idea was first launched by BA last year under its World Offer
scheme and immediately opened a price war with Richard Branson's Virgin.
He immediately pledged to undercut BA by #1 on all the routes shared by both
airlines and he seems set to announce the same deal this year. When BA
announced their discounts yesterday, Virgin claimed they were just about to
announce their own prices.
BA's deal is designed to fill seats on otherwise quiet flights up to the end of
March.
It includes return trips to New York for #196 and Australia for #596.
BA has now sold more than 1.5 million World Offer holidays since it was started
in March 1994.
Among the 100 BA routes with discounts until January 17 are return flights to
Nice, Madrid or Vienna for #96 - saving up to #93.
A return flight to Harare in Zimbabwe is #599, saving #358 and to Dubai from
#449, saving #277. Nairobi is cut by #356 to #439.
San Francisco and Los Angeles are down by #107 to #296 and Darwin and Perth in
Australia are available from #596 - a #161 saving.
There are 60 European routes, about 20 long-haul destinations and almost as
many domestic flights, including Belfast and Manchester from #55 return.
Returns to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Inverness from London are
available from #68.
Some of the worldwide offers are available from other airports apart from
Heathrow - the #196 New York return also goes from Glasgow and Birmingham, for
instance.
A spokeswoman for BA said: ``Last year's January sale was highly successful so
we decided to do it again.
``There are some terrific bargains around on almost 100 routes for people who
want to travel early next year.''

<HEADLINE>Latest Belfast killing puts new pressure on the peace process</HEADLINE>

THE Northern Ireland peace process was under new pressure last night after the
latest paramilitary-style killing in Belfast.
Even though no organisation admitted responsibility for the shooting of petty
criminal Martin McCrory, 3O - the sixth man murdered since April - the IRA is
being blamed for directing the campaign of attacks in republican areas of the
city.
Senior RUC officers fear there could be more deaths and, last night, Ulster
Unionist leader David Trimble said it was time the Government and the
leadership of the nationalist SDLP spoke out about the heightening scale of
terror which has left four dead this month.
He said: ``It is a matter of major concern that there now is a return to
violence after nationalists assured us of a permanent peace. The silence from
the SDLP leadership is quite deafening and obviously there is no ceasefire when
people are being murdered.
``The Government and those nationalists promoting the peace process must come
clean on this. They have got to face up to what is going on and see how they
can help the authorities bring it to an end.''
Most of the victims of the five previous killings were suspected drug dealers
and the attacks were apparently part of a so-called republican purge.
However, Mr McCrory, hit by a shotgun blast at his home at Norglen Parade, Turf
Lodge, was, according to security sources, a known car thief and burglar with
only minimal involvement in drugs.
He was shot in the legs by the IRA seven years ago in a punishment attack.
His three-year-old son, who was sitting beside him at the time of the latest
fatal shooting through a back, ground-floor window, was slightly injured in the
hand. His common-law wife and another son, aged eight, escaped unhurt.
The violence has clearly unsettled Ministers in London and Dublin at a
particularly difficult and tense time for the peace process.
Although the IRA ceasefire still stands, there is growing unease among senior
RUC officers that the shootings will continue.
One security source said last night: ``Who knows when they will stop and that's
a big concern. I can't see it getting out of control but I can't see an end in
sight either. Some of these people who believed themselves to be at risk
cleared off to England. The majority drifted back and it could get to the stage
where they (the killers) don't really want to stop.
``It's the heavy hand at work. It's a way of life. Feelings don't come into it,
certainly not the ceasefire.''
West Belfast SDLP MP Dr Joe Hendron believes the Provisionals were behind it.
He said: ``It's another phase of the onslaught against a section of the
nationalist people and if Sinn Fein want to be considered democrats, then this
campaign must be stopped.''
A group calling itself Direct Action Against Drugs (DAAD) said it was
responsible for Mr McCrory's killing.
The organisation used a recognised password in a claim to a local radio station
but police believe it is a flag of convenience for the IRA.
The group had claimed responsibility for most of the other five killings since
April.
q The terrorist ceasefires helped boost the number of tourists visiting the
Irish Republic in 1995 to a record 4.2 million, according to preliminary
figures.

IT could have cost them #100,000 - but bookies would rather have seen a white
Christmas in London than faced the white-out that has confined race horses to
their stables across the country.
Boxing Day, normally one of the busiest days of the year for turf accountants,
was dismally quiet as - with the exception of one meeting in Limerick, all
races in the UK and Ireland were called off because of frozen tracks.
It was the first white-out for horse racing for 33 years.
Nearly all horse racing has been cancelled for the rest of the week - only
Wolverhampton will be offering action, with fixtures on its all-weather ground
on Saturday.
Punters have been left with the option of putting their money on dogs or South
African horse racing, which they can monitor via satellite.
Darts, American football, and rugby events are also coming up, but football -
the other main attraction for gamblers - will be devastated this weekend.
Only four games are likely to go ahead, at grounds with undersoil heating -
Rangers v Hibs, Hamilton Accies v St Mirren, Dundee United v Airdrie, and
Queen's Park v Ross County.
Horse racing fan Bob Hunter said yesterday: ``There's nothing for me to do. I'm
on holiday until January 3 and I like to punt as a hobby, but there's nothing
for me to punt on.
``South African horse racing is a joke, there's no detailed form. Punters at
the bookmaker's know the horses they're going in for, but with South Africa
it's only numbers.
``When there's been a bad winter in the past, there's always something
organised but this year it's absolutely terrible. It's bad organisation by the
British Horse Racing Board.''
Mr Jack Smith, a director of Glasgow-based John Smith Bookmakers, says his
turnover and profit are both 50% down this week. Most of the regular customers
at his betting office in West Nile Street - one of seven in Glasgow and
Coatbridge - are staying at home.
Mr Smith said:``There are so many meetings on Boxing Day that a few usually
survive if the weather turns bad.
``We need continuity so that the punters who are coming in know what they are
doing. Once you have a break, it affects profitability.''
A spokesman for Ladbrokes bookmakers said: ``Betting shops have a social
atmosphere. People are coming in for only a couple of minutes instead of 15.
``It's true that we didn't have to pay out on the white Christmas bets but we
would rather have paid out on that than lost Boxing Day.''
Mr John Smee, spokesman for the British Horse Racing Board, said it needed
three days' notice to re-arrange fixtures.
He added: ``The weather forecasts are not particularly good and a lot of race
courses were making positive noises up until Boxing Day morning.
``If we had known three days before Boxing Day that we would be faced with a
white-out, we could have had all-weather track racing.
``The only fixtures we can line up are at all-weather tracks and we have begun
to do that.
Mr Smee said additional fixtures being staged this week would not be regarded
as cost effective by the Levy Board, the Government body which collects revenue
and distributes it as prize money.

BRITISH Nato helicopters flew big guns over the frozen fields of Bosnia to show
its former warriors they mean business.
``We want everyone to realise we have the capability to use force against force
if we have to, though we hope it will never happen. We're advertising very
visibly that we have guns,'' said British Nato spokesman Colonel David Shaw.
Two RAF Chinook helicopters swept across the deep valleys, startling children
and turning heads as the British put on a noisy show of might.
Slung beneath the helicopters were 105mm field guns and crates of ammunition
that swung out wide as the aircraft banked over the now-silent confrontation
lines that divide Croat and Muslim-led government forces from the Serbs.
The weaponry was dramatically delivered to a field just outside Sanski Most,
one of the last towns seized by Muslim and Croat forces in a summer campaign of
conquest that helped to compel the Bosnian Serbs into agreeing a peace deal.
The barrels of the six guns were pointed towards the confrontation line.
The British must ensure the two sides pull back from each other's throats by
the middle of next month.
``This has been quite an overt movement,'' said Lieutenant Alan Parks, the Gun
Position Officer. ``We're here to show Nato's strength and resolve to implement
the peace deal.''
One of his soldiers commented: ``This should impress the locals . . . it'll
scare them so they behave themselves.''
The Chinooks flew low over burnt-out houses in desolate landscapes marched over
back and forth by armies last summer. Their flight path traced a way through
some of the area's most volatile zones.
Light cloud cleared as the pair of heavy twin-rotored craft swept slowly over
the Croat-held town of Jajce, where a British helicopter was shot at three days
ago in what Nato said was a dangerous show of indiscipline. All was quiet below.
``We purposefully flew over a couple of areas today so they could see we're
here. Hopefully then there will be no messing about,'' said a sergeant, holding
his machinegun in an icy draught coming through the helicopter's gunport.
On the ground, other British units of the peace force were moving deeper into
Serb-held territory.
Armoured vehicles from the Light Dragoons regiment headed to set up a base in
Prijedor, an area that saw some of the most vicious ``ethnic cleansing'' at the
beginning of the war.
Other British troops have moved into the Serb citadel of Banja Luka, in the
deepest penetration yet of strongholds off limits to Nato's precursors, the
United Nations. The Alliance said all its forces were warmly welcomed.
With the bulk of the British peace force of 13,000 men and heavy tanks not due
to arrive for some weeks, officials concede there is an element of bluff to its
helicopter tactics.
``This is just a taster of what we've got, there's more to come,'' said one
Nato officer among the 2500 British troops so far in Bosnia.-Reuter.

BABIES suckled on mother's milk grow up to be brighter than their bottle-fed
counterparts, according to a medical survey released yesterday.
The study showed that university entry could depend on whether the applicant
was breast-fed in the first 10 weeks of life, and that pre-term babies fed on
mother's milk had an IQ eight points higher than those who were put on formula
or cow's milk.
About 8OO babies were followed up by Cambridge-based Dr Alan Lucas of the
Medical Research Council, who discovered the alarming difference in their
intelligence.
Professor Michael Crawford, head of the Institute of Brain Chemistry and Human
Nutrition at Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children in Hackney, east London,
plans to present the findings to a conference on children's health next month.
He said: ``Latest research shows babies fed on mother's milk have an IQ eight
points up on those put on formula or cow's milk An IQ of 112 would not normally
be enough to qualify an applicant for a place at university, whereas an IQ of
12O would suffice. Mother's milk in pre-term babies could have provided those
vital eight points.''
Professor Crawford said: ``It was a very large study and those babies fed on
formula had a much lower IQ compared to breast-fed ones - who were also more
resistant to infections.
``There are obvious reasons for this because there are certain products in
human milk not present in bottled milk, including growth factors which may
influence brain development.
``There are also nutrients present in human milk important for the growth and
development of the brain.
``One or two formula companies are at long last beginning to put them in after
realising the differences.''
Heart disease and diabetes may also be linked to nutrition in early childhood.
And to what extent breast, colon, and prostate cancers, among the most frequent
causes of death from cancer, may also be linked to diet will be discussed at
the conference.
Research shows that people who live off a fish diet are among the least likely
to fall victim to these forms of cancer. In Japan, Africa, and Asia, such
cancers are comparatively rare compared to Europe or America.

THREE Scots, carried away with the chauvinism of Braveheart, were less
enamoured with the sequel when police with English accents arrived at a Fife
cinema.
The three men from Glenrothes began shouting and swearing as they became caught
up in the mood of the hit film, Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court was told yesterday.
When the police officers with English accents turned up in response to a
management call, two of the men ended up struggling with them.
George Naylor, 35, of Bruce Road; John Naylor, 34, of Canmore Road; and Andrew
Mayes, 32, of Elgin Drive, were appearing before Sheriff William Christie.
George Naylor and Mayes admitted that on October 4 in the Glenrothes Cinema at
Carrickgate, they conducted themselves in a disorderly manner, shouted and
swore, refused to leave when asked to do so, struggled with police, and
committed a breach of the peace.
John Naylor admitted the same charge, with the exception of struggling with the
police.
Depute fiscal Christine Baillie said the men became very angry during the film
and shouted and swore, disturbing other patrons.
Staff called police but the men refused to leave.
``It became apparent to the accused the officers had strong English accents,''
said Ms Baillie, adding that this ``aggravated matters''.
George Naylor was handcuffed but John Naylor managed to leave the cinema during
the fracas and was arrested later, said Ms Baillie, adding that all three had
been drinking.
Defence agent Martin Collins said: ``It's not uncommon for the audience to
respond to this film in a fairly vigorous manner.
``The film, I understand, seeks as part of the oeuvre, to stimulate a
particularly chauvinistic kind of nationalism.''
When Mr Collins, who speaks with an English accent, pointed out that he
approached the matter ``from the point of view of someone who is not native to
these shores'', Sheriff Christie commented: ``I am surprised your clients
instructed you then.''
George Naylor was ordered to undertake 150 hours of community service, John
Naylor was fined #200, and Mayes was fined #150.

<HEADLINE>Bus crash whiplash injury cost driver his job and forced him to abandon fitness hobbies #200,000 damages for cabbie</HEADLINE>

A TAXI driver who suffered whiplash injuries when a bus ran into the back of
his vehicle has been awarded #204,000 damages.
The injury has forced fitness enthusiast Colin Paterson, 35, to give up his job
and his hobbies of weightlifting, karate, and swimming.
The Court of Session had heard that Mr Paterson, of Hollowglen Road, Glasgow,
had stopped his Ford Orion taxi at traffic lights in Cowcaddens, Glasgow, in
January 1991, when it was hit by a Kelvin Central bus, causing extensive damage.
Liability against Motherwell-based Kelvin Central Buses Ltd was not disputed.
In a written judgment, Lord Dawson said Mr Paterson had not initially felt the
effects of any injury.
He went to bed after being driven home and it was only when he woke up the
following morning that he felt a pain in his neck. It then became clear that he
had suffered a whiplash injury, which still affected him when the case came to
court.
Lord Dawson said Mr Paterson had suffered previous neck injuries and the main
dispute in the case was whether his persisent problems were caused by the crash
or by an earlier incident.
The bus accident happened several weeks after Mr Paterson had returned to work
following treatment for another neck injury caused by a fall.
After hearing medical evidence, the judge decided Mr Paterson had recovered
from the after effects of the fall when the bus hit his taxi and that his
subsequent problems were caused by the crash.
Before the accident, Mr Paterson had worked almost exclusively as a driver,
including a spell with an Army driving unit. He began driving taxis in 1988 and
got his own plate in 1990.
The court heard that he had tried returning to work since his accident but
suffers pain after driving for about 20 minutes and has difficulty turning his
head.
The judge added: ``He has not worked since. He considers it would be dangerous
to go back to driving.''
Mr Paterson also suffers from dizzy spells and his sleep is often disturbed.
He told the court he had tried in vain to find other work but his prospects
were hampered by having done little apart from driving. He also suffers from
dyslexia.
Lord Dawson said: ``His wife spoke to his continued frustration at not being
able to work and having to rely on her to support the family. I accepted that
evidence as credible and reliable.''
He awarded a total of #204,150 to cover past and future loss of earnings and to
compensate for Mr Paterson's pain and suffering.

<HEADLINE>Chairman puts Tories on 1996 election alert</HEADLINE>

TORY chairman Brian Mawhinney yesterday put the Conservatives on full battle
alert in case the Prime Minister is forced to call a General Election next year.
He made it clear he believed Parliament would run its full course to May 1997
but produced the first acknowledgment by a senior member of the Cabinet that a
poll in 1996 was a possibility. ``We will be ready to go whenever the Prime
Minister calls,'' he said.
In a rallying call which demonstrates the state of nervousness within the Tory
hierarchy, Dr Mawhinney told Conservatives across the country to stop fighting
one another and start thinking votes.
In a clear message to the Euro-sceptics and other warring factions, he said
there was ``no time or tolerance for internal argument or selfish
grandstanding.'' He bluntly told all constituencies: ``I am asking you to put
your association on election alert now.''
Signalling the tone of the arguments the Tories would deploy in the run-up to
the General Election, Dr Mawhinney lambasted Labour leader Tony Blair's past
nuclear disarmament links, saying: ``With Communists back in prominence in
Russia, Britain could never feel safe with a former CND member in Downing
Street.''
Mr Major has made it clear that he wants to play a long game, going to the
country at the last possible moment and certainly allowing time for another,
presumably tax-cutting, Budget next November.
However, he is operating on a wafer-thin Commons majority, which is likely to
be further reduced by by-elections in the Labour stronghold of Hemsworth,
Yorkshire, and in Staffordshire South East after the death of Tory MP Sir David
Lightbown (majority 7192). The party has not won a by-election since 1989.
If Tory MP David Ashby, who recently lost a costly libel action, were to be
declared bankrupt, he would have to quit the Commons. The Tories would have to
defend a majority of only 979 in his Leicetershire North West constituency. In
short, Mr Major could, within a few months, be facing the prospect of running a
minority Government.
It emerged yesterday that a leading firm of actuaries - Lane, Clark, and
Peacock - has predicted there are likely to be four more Tory deaths during
1996. If correct, the prediction would wipe out Mr Major's majority and his
problems could be compounded by poor local-government election results in May.
In his New Year message, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said that in
Government there was a divided, discredited Conservative Party that had lost
direction and was out of touch with Britain's people and Britain's needs.
He said: ``They began 1995 in a mess of sleaze and incompetence, they ended the
year in division and disarray. Riven by internal divisions, the Government can
no longer give clear leadership.
``Weighed down by their own record in office, the Government can no longer
convince people that they can deliver the change that people want or Britain
needs.
"Trapped by the consequences of their own economic mismanagement, they can only
buy their survival by undermining the nation's economy, people's jobs, and our
children's future.
``Ensnared by their own broken promises, they are finding it impossible to
regain the trust of the British people.''

A CHINESE court today rejected the appeal of dissident Wei Jingsheng and upheld
a 14-year prison term for plotting to subvert the government.
Relatives said they would sue the courts for dereliction of duty, and France
demanded the release of the man regarded as the father of China's embattled
democracy movement.
``The appeal of Wei Jingsheng was unreasonable and had to be rejected,'' said
Chief Judge Wang Yi of the Beijing People's Higher Court.
Wei, 45, has no more appeals. ``This is the final trial,'' said court spokesman
Chen Xiong.
The 1995 Nobel Peace Prize nominee now begins his second lengthy jail term. He
was expected to be held in solitary confinement, as in the past.
Wei and his two lawyers attended the sentencing in western Beijing. Dozens of
police surrounded the court building, and foreign reporters were barred from
covering the sentencing.
The appeals bench summoned Wei on Tuesday to a hearing behind closed doors at
which he spoke for more than one hour and gave a written statement. His lawyers
presented a 2000-word defence.
``The evidence is conclusive and the facts brook no denial,'' said Wang Yi in
his judgment.
Wei will be eligible for parole after serving half of his sentence, lawyers say.
His family denounced the trial as a farce and said they planned to take legal
action against the courts for dereliction of duty.
``We are not only depressed, we are very angry,'' Wei's sister, Wei Shanshan,
said in a telephone interview from her home in Hamburg, Germany.
``The courts are shameless . . . The trial was unfair. They had no legal basis
to convict my brother . . . It was ridiculous.''
Wei's brother, Wei Xiaotao, said he would dispute the evidence used against Wei
as politically motivated.
The Beijing Number One People's Intermediate Court convicted Wei on December 13
of financing China's struggling democracy movement, whose existence is seen by
the state as seditious because it questions the Communist Party's absolute
rule.
The earlier verdict triggered international condemnation but Beijing responded
by rebuking foreign countries for meddling in its domestic affairs.
Wei was first imprisoned in 1979 for ``counter-revolutionary incitement'',
advocating democratic change and passing purported military secrets to a
foreign reporter.
He was paroled in September, 1993, six months before the end of his 15-year
sentence.
During his six months of freedom, Wei said he had no regrets and continued to
criticise the Communist Party.
HONG KONG: China has excluded local democrats from the team responsible for
steering Hong Kong through its transition from British colony to Chinese
Special Administrative Region (SAR) in 1997. Appointments to the 150-strong
Preparatory Committee cold-shouldered Hong Kong's most popular political party,
the Democratic Party, and drew heavily from the colony's business elite.-Reuter.

A CLAIM of unfair dismissal against the wife of Kilmarnock Football Club
chairman, Mr Bob Fleeting, has been rejected by a Glasgow industrial tribunal.
Mrs Ann Fleeting, who began managing the Stanecastle Hotel at Irvine earlier
this year, was accused of unfair dismissal by former hotel worker Mrs Caroline
McDonald.
The tribunal heard Mrs McDonald was working at the hotel when Mrs Fleeting
assumed management.
Existing staff were told they would be kept on but the hotel would close for 12
weeks of refurbishment. Mrs McDonald was laid off in April and the hotel was
not ready to re-open until mid-November.
Mrs McDonald's then solicitors had written to Mrs Fleeting and her husband,
raising the question of a redundancy payment but, after that, the matter
``plainly went off the rails'', the tribunal noted.
The tribunal heard the refurbishment work was delayed beyond Mrs Fleeting's
expectations but she told Mrs McDonald she was willing to reinstate her and to
take whatever steps were legally required of her.
The tribunal said the lay-off and what would have to be regarded as extensions
of that lay-off, could not be attributed to blameworthy conduct on Mrs
Fleeting's part.

A SELF-CONFESSED thief claimed yesterday that a man confessed to a horrific
murder while they shared a court cell.
Patrick Haggerty told the High Court in Glasgow that George Walker described
how he killed 22-year-old prostitute Leona McGovern, 22.
Haggerty, 36, claimed that Walker told him he was Leona's murderer last week.
He told advocate depute Michael O'Grady he had been put in the same cell as
Walker, 31, after being brought from Barlinnie Prison.
He said that, initially, Walker said Leona must have been killed by a
psychopath. However, he told Mr O'Grady: ``He then told me a belt was put round
her neck and pulled through a fence before she was stabbed 17 times around the
head and neck with a screwdriver.''
Haggerty added: ``He offered to take off his belt and show me how he did it but
I refused. I thought it was tragic what happened to the girl. I believe he
murdered her and that he is a bit of a psychopath.
``He said the girl owed him money for drugs.''
At that point, Haggerty began shouting: ``The man is a danger, you can't let
him out onto the streets.''
He was stopped by Mr O'Grady, who told him: `We don't want your opinions.''
Haggerty also claimed that Walker had told him months earlier, when they were
taking drugs together, that he had ``throttled'' Miss McGovern.
He denied that police had promised they would ``go easy'' on him for giving
evidence.
Walker denies murdering Miss McGovern in Washington Street, behind Strathclyde
Arts Centre, on June 2 this year.
The trial continues.

A COMPENSATION deal for survivors and relatives of men killed in the Cormorant
Alpha helicopter disaster is believed to have been struck after talks in the
United States, it emerged last night.
Ten oil rig workers and a co-pilot died in the 1992 crash, which happened
shortly after the Super Puma helicopter had taken off from the platform.
Lawyers have been battling for compensation from oil companies Shell, Esso, and
Exxon and it is understood that an out of court settlement has now been reached
on ``fairly favourable terms''.
Victims and survivors should receive at least #500,000, it is believed.
A total of 53 claimants, mostly from Scotland, are involved in the legal
dispute.
The latest development follows a wrangle over whether the case should be heard
in Scotland or the US. Claimants prefer US courts because payouts are higher.
A Shell spokesman said last night he could not confirm the reports. Esso UK and
Exxon were unable to comment.

EAGLE-EYED Katherine McMath was praised yesterday for not being fooled by
counterfeit goods.
The nine-year-old pupil at Nether Currie Primary School near Edinburgh was one
of only 4% of people not caught out by fake items in a consumer competition run
by trading standard chiefs.
More than 1000 people were shown a range of bogus and genuine products and
asked to differentiate between the two.
Katherine wasn't fooled once by the 10 fake products, which included a fake
Liverpool top, fake Ray-ban sun-glasses, and a fake Lion King video.
Lothian Trading Standards director Mike Drewry said the results of the survey
showed how difficult it was becoming for the public to tell the difference
between fake and brand- name goods.
Mr Drewry said: ``This survey was one of the most extensive ever undertaken in
Scotland involving consumer product counterfeiting. The findings show that
counterfeiting is no longer a small scale cottage industry type of operation.
``It is now an international trade involving major criminal organisations who
invest heavily in expensive equipment to illegally copy brand-name goods.''
``It's not just perfumes and designer clothes that are now being counterfeited,
fake car parts and aircraft parts, like brakes, are being sold and are putting
the consumer at risk.''
Councillor Brian Fallon, chairman of Lothian Region's general purposes
committee, warned people all over Scotland to be on their guard.
Councillor Fallon said: ``Walk into a lot of pubs at this time of year and
you'll get someone offering you a cheap bottle of perfume or a cut-price watch.
``However, once you get it home, you'll find it's not all that it's cracked up
to be.''

THE Ministry of Defence has awarded a #40m contract to the US Loral Federal
Systems company to develop and produce Tomahawk cruise missile kits for seven
of the Royal Navy's nuclear submarines.
The contract, which involves a teaming arrangement with Vickers Shipbuilding
and Engineering Ltd at Barrow-in-Furness, includes training for RN crews and
provision of guidance and fire-control equipment and computer software to allow
the British hunter-killers to launch the missiles from their torpedo tubes.
Loral is expected to oversee installation of the system in the first three
boats. The MoD then foresees putting the work out to tender on the next four.
The MoD has spent more than a year negotiating the purchase of cruise missiles
for its submarine fleet. With essential modifications, any boat with a 21-inch
diameter torpedo tube is capable of launching the Tomahawk.

Never shy, Stanley Baxter is retired, ANDREW YOUNG finds, despite one special
small-screen appearance
THERE is something about comedians that makes it difficult for them to retire
while there is still a laugh out there waiting to be had. An exception until
now has been Stanley Baxter. He was adamant he had retired, exit, full stop.
Others have come back, some never gone away. Jack Milroy and Rikki Fulton, as
Francie and Josie, did ``another farewell appearance'' at the Pavilion and have
booked the King's, Glasgow, for ``the best farewell season so far''. Bob Hope,
in his mid-nineties, still makes 'em laugh. George Burns says he will play the
Palladium when he is 100, and he's 99 now.
But Baxter, the ``control freak'', the dame of the century, for whom perfection
is everything, did his last Mother Goose at the King's, Glasgow, four years
ago, told his suffering agent to accept no more work, apart from radio and
television commercial voice-overs. Diminishing production values did not meet
his standards. It had already happened with his television spectaculars and he
refused to appear in lesser shows although the offers were plentiful.
Everything had to be done by the book, as written by Stanley. And neatly, at
the conventional retirement age of 65, he went back into his private life. Then
along came Michael Grade, head of Channel 4. An independent company had asked
Baxter to choose his favourite bits from 30 glorious, award-laden years of
television. Grade wanted new in-put and his charm persuaded Baxter to provide
the links.
So far as the producers were concerned, it was no longer a case of: ``If ye
want me thingmy, ring me!'' - his catchphrase from the early fifties radio
series It's All Yours in which he appeared with Jimmy Logan. So successful was
he at the retirement business that a Sunday supplement recently ran a huge
cover story based entirely on tracing Baxter, ``the invisible man''. It started
with the premise that he might have become a Howard Hughes-type recluse.
The writer had been brooding on the subject for more than a year, done masses
of research, pored over voters' rolls, gone to the wrong people for leads. It
read like Stanley (the journalist) trying to trace Livingstone. And when he
finally came face to face on a north London doorstep, he blurted out something
like: ``Mr Baxter, I presume?'' What an anti-climax it must have been then to
be told politely to go away.
The great mystery was why it was a mystery. If he regards you as a friend, he
is happy to talk until the cows come home. And sharp, witty, warm-hearted he is
with it. As an ordinary member of the public he retains the actor's chameleon
ability to melt into a crowd. To call him a comedian is perhaps a misnomer. He
is more an actor with a talent to evoke laughter.
In his shows everything had to be done by the script. Ad libs were a danger to
his kind of perfection. In private life he is happy in his own little world
with a routine that suits him very well. He keeps himself fit by swimming so
many lengths of the baths most days, plans ahead, knowing where he is going to
be at a certain time.
There is an appreciation of the good things - like the BMW, the clothes, the
restaurants. He has a select group of friends to whom he is staunchly loyal,
and has sadly seen several of them fall early from the perch, like Kenneth
Williams, LWT producer David Bell, director/choreographer Bruce McClure. Out of
the costumes, he cuts a natty dash. Just now it is the calf-length tweed coat,
the gloves, scarf tied neatly, hat at the right angle. His Mammy would have
been proud of him. He carries with him an air of excitement that is infectious.
As a performer he has always hated the sound of his own voice. His
impersonations of Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, Shirley Bassey and HM have
been refinements of his panto dames, caught with an accuracy some have
described as cruel, but there has always been affection there, too.
In his teens he saw Lena Horne in a film at the Ascot, Anniesland. Then he
caught a tram out to the Boulevarde, Knightswood, to see Meet Me in St Louis,
not knowing what it would be like. It was the one in which Judy Garland sang
The Trolley Song. ``And I came out absolutely walking on air,'' he said. ``That
must be the greatest musical I've ever seen, and, although I've seen many
since, I haven't altered that opinion.'' Many of the pastiches to follow were
inspired at that time.
The Baxter household was in Wilton Street, on the edge of gentility, the bit
that could be called North Kelvinside, before it ran into Maryhill. Young
Stanley would be despatched to Jaconelli's Cafe, which was, and still is, in
Maryhill Road, to return with a big jug of ice cream. It was a cosy, cheerful
household. Father was an assistant manager with an insurance company, Mother
had been an aspiring actress. His sister became an actress, stage name Alice
Dale.
Artist Bet Low was a war-time art school student when she became part of a
coterie of friends that included emerging writer Jack Gerson and artist Bill
Henry. He was ``well into theatricals then''. They were to get a preview of
things to come. Stanley would appear from behind the curtains on the big
aureole window of the top flat in Wilton Street, full of confidence, and do his
turns.
Timing was all and, as Bet Low recalls, he would never turn up anywhere unless
he thought the scene had been set. Even going to the left-wing Unity Theatre he
worried that the right people would be there. ``We sparked off each other. He
was always great company.'' He had been so impressed with the Kurt Joost
ballet, Green Table, at the Theatre Royal that he and Low cooked up a ballet of
the life of Buddha for Joost. Baxter now squirms at the conceit, but still
treasures the costume and stage designs done by Low.
There were his years at Hillhead High School. He might not have excelled
academically but he was the tops in writing, producing, and starring in school
pantos and plays. He was on the wireless, too. Aunt Kathleen Garscadden of
Children's Hour put him on a box so his head would come up to the same
microphone level as the others.
Robert Louis Stevenson and a middle-ear infection were, indirectly, to put him
on the road to stardom. As a ``child artiste'' he had been evacuated to
Millport. Returning to Glasgow to play David Balfour in Kidnapped on the
wireless, the unheated train broke down in a snow storm resulting in the
infection.
A sequence of unlikely events then played their part. The Second World War was
still running when, at the age of 17 and three-quarters, he was called up as a
miner, a Bevin Boy (named after Ernest Bevin, then Minister of Labour and
National Service). He was downgraded from A1 when the ear infection came back.
Accepted by the Army, he became a storeman on Rangoon Race Course, thence to
Combined Services Entertainment in Singapore where the first person he met was
Kenneth Williams. They did the complete It Aint Half Hot, Mum bit all over the
Far East and he rates this as the best time he ever had in showbusiness because
he had all of the fun and none of the responsibility.
Bet Low still has the hilarious letters he sent her at that time, full of black
marks contributed by the censor.
Back in Civvy Street everything fell into place, his talents matching the
opportunities. He was in Tyrone Guthrie's Edinburgh Festival production of The
Thrie Estaites, and he was there in time to be part of what he described as the
Camelot years of the Citizens'. He met his wife, actress Moira Robertson.
Working with legendary characters like Duncan Macrae in their Christmas show,
The Tintock Cup, took him on to the Fabulous Five Past Eight shows and pantos
at the Alhambra and the King's, Glasgow. The award-winning television specials
followed.
He had a great affection for Alex Mitchell, who he called ``faither'', a Weekly
News journalist and writer of much of his material, including the Parliamo
Glasgow sketches.
Looking at least 10 years younger than his age, there are many Shakespearean
roles in which he could excel. His comedy overshadowed his serious acting
abilities, like starring in Joe Orton's What the Butler Saw. But he insists it
is radio only, is currently being heard on Radio 2 reading extracts from
Compton Mackenzie's Whisky Galore!
Within a few months of his 70th birthday, he is enjoying every minute of normal
retirement which has now been resumed. Stanley Baxter is back in control.
n Stanley Baxter is Back, is on Channel 4 on Thursday, at 9pm.
Timing was all, Stanley would never turn up anywhere unless he thought the
scene hadbeen set

Roy Rogers examines the growing gulf between directors and workers
AN UNSAVOURY dichotomy of increasing job insecurity for most workers alongside
continuing ``fat cat'' pay and pensions for many directors is highlighted in
two new               surveys.
Job fears are slowing economic growth, warns the TUC, commenting on a study
showing that 50% of employees throughout the UK - 56% in Scotland - expect
their position to be less secure in the coming year.
Three-quarters (74%) expect to be under more pressure at work in the coming
year and, once again, Scots show greater-than-average anxiety, registering 83%,
which is topped only by the 89% fear rating in the English West Midlands.
The job situation made 73% less likely to move house next year, and nearly
two-thirds (60%) said they were less likely to make major household purchases
or boost their pension payments (64%).
Commenting on the survey, which was commissioned from Harris, TUC general
secretary John Monks said: ``The survey shows that people's insecurity at work
is now a serious brake on economic growth.''
It was restraining the recovery in consumer spending and the return of any real
``feel-good factor'' he said.
The TUC survey of 675 people in current employment found 52% agreed with the
statement ``I expect jobs in my workplace will become less secure in the year
ahead than over the last two years.'' Only 30% disagreed.
The Government's economic forecasts hinge on strong growth in consumption and
the TUC argues this new evidence linking job insecurity and consumer spending
points to weaker economic growth and slower job creation during 1996 than the
Chancellor predicted in last month's Budget.
``The Government have made a rod for their own back by removing many of the
basic protections for people at work,'' said Mr Monks. ``Giving employers a
free hand has done little to boost economic prosperity but it has hit much of
middle-Britain very hard indeed.''
Job insecurity now reaches deep into the country's core workforce, as the TUC
survey reveals levels of concern are highest among professional and
white-collar workers and those in the prime years (35-55) of their working
life. Employees are most worried in London, the West Midlands and Scotland.
``These are key groups which the Conservatives must win over before the next
election,'' said Mr Monks. ``But their programme to scrap basic rights at work
is doing the opposite. Thoughtful Conservatives now recognise this, and see
that people are more concerned about having a job next year than tax cuts.
``Concerns about greater security and fairer treatment at work are set to
become a defining political difference in the year ahead.''
Meanwhile, mounting public concern over job insecurity seems not to have
troubled too many board rooms where a forthcoming Labour research department
survey will show many company directors are still receiving huge pension
contributions on top of already high salaries.
A report in the January issue of the Labour Research magazine finds that more
than a quarter of top directors in the FT Stock Exchange 100 companies were
given contributions of #100,000 or more in one year alone and that just over
half received #50,000 or more.
Topping the league is Jim Fifield, American-based director of the EMI Music
Division of EMI, with a pension contribution of #869,000 - even higher than
most of the directors' salaries. He is followed by Sir Neil Shaw, chair of the
Tate &amp; Lyle sugar group, who was provided with #756,000.
Executives generally do very well in percentage terms, with a third of those in
the survey receiving pension contributions equivalent to more than 20% of their
pay, whereas workers tend to get about 10% of earnings paid into their pension
schemes - just over #1700 a year for those on average earnings.
Sir Neil Shaw's contribution amounted to more than 165% of his #456,000 salary
while the #257,120 contribution received by Blue Circle chief executive Keith
Orrell-Jones represented more than 80% of his #320,320 salary.
A comparison between the two surveys would appear to suggest that Britain's top
directors may well have a monopoly on that ``feel good'' factor which continues
to elude the vast majority of the population.

<HEADLINE>Daughter in appeal to her father's killer</HEADLINE>

THE daughter of a man stabbed more than 20 times in a Christmas morning street
murder yesterday made an emotional appeal to the killer - ``Tell me why.''
Mrs Vikki Bannon said she could see no reason for her father John Trinder's
killing.
She said: ``They've taken my Christmas, my dad's life, and mine and my family's
with it.''
Mr Trinder, 55, a distant cousin of the comedian Tommy Trinder, died within
yards of his south-east London home after being attacked as he walked back
after a Christmas Eve drink at his local pub.
A smartly-dressed white man in his late 20s was seen running off and getting
into a waiting Ford Fiesta after the murder at 12.30am in Solway Road, Peckham.
Police believe the driver may not have been aware of what happened because the
car was parked around the corner.
Detective Superintendent Gordon King, leading the inquiry, said: ``I'd like
that driver to come forward because he may not know that his passenger stabbed
Mr Trinder over 20 times in a quite vicious, senseless and, as far as I can see
at the moment, motiveless attack.''
Mrs Bannon, 24, an office clerk from nearby New Cross, appealed to the driver,
saying: ``If he didn't know and now he does and he's frightened for some
reason, just come and talk to somebody.''
Mr Trinder, a divorced unemployed scaffolder who lived alone, was a happy
family man, his daughter said.
``He lived for being our dad, mine and my brothers. That's what he had in
life,'' Mrs Bannon said at a police news conference in Peckham.
She said she could think of no incident that could have led to his murder.
She had been with her father in the days before his death and he had spent
Christmas Eve with her godparents.
He had gone to the Rye Hotel that evening for ``an amicable drink'' and there
had been no cross words.
``I can't see any reason. He left the pub on good terms with everybody. He even
borrowed some bread so he could go home and have some supper.
``He wasn't looking for trouble. You don't try to defend yourself with a loaf
of bread.''
Mr King said police did not believe the motive for the attack was robbery
because Mr Trinder had nearly #80 on him and nothing was missing.
Also, a robber would have been unlikely to have stabbed him more than once or
twice.
``As far as I am aware, Mr Trinder was not involved in any illegal activity. He
was not a local criminal.
``He was a bit of a local character. He was Mr Average, Mr Ordinary, minding
his own business, who was set upon by this man for apparently no reason
whatsoever. The sheer ferocity of the attack is almost beyond belief.''
Mr King said the Ford Fiesta either followed Mr Trinder on his five-minute walk
home or was waiting for him.
He described the man seen running from the murder scene as 5ft 9ins, of slim
build, with darkish hair and wearing denim jeans and a white or cream-coloured
top.

PEOPLE have a greater fear than ever of being caught drink driving, according
to police chiefs.
Police believe this is supported by a fall in the number of drivers whose tests
have proved positive in the five weeks up until yesterday.
A total of 880 drivers provided positive tests, 18 drivers fewer than the same
period last year, according to figures released by the Association of Chief
Police Officers in Scotland (Acpos).
The decrease comes against a background of a huge rise in the number of drivers
stopped by Scotland's eight police forces. A total of 67,592 have been stopped
since the start of the Scottish Police Forces campaign launched on November 24
- a rise of 60% on the same period last year.
Mr Ian Mackinnon, secretary of the traffic standing committee of Acpos, and
Strathclyde assistant chief constable (traffic), welcomed the continued trend
but pledged that forces throughout Scotland would continue their efforts
against drink-drivers over the New Year holiday period and beyond. ``I am
heartened to see a decrease in the number of positive tests and I think it
reflects a greater fear of being detected drink-driving this year than ever
before,'' he said.
However, he also warned drivers to take extra care in the current icy condition
which ``make for very dangerous driving conditions even without a driver taking
a drink''..

Britons' trial
faces fresh delay
BANGKOK: The trial of two Britons charged with trying to smuggle heroin out of
Thailand was adjourned yesterday as a witness for the defence again failed to
appear.
Sandra Gregory, 30, from Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, and Robert Lock, 30,
from Cambridge, have been in prison since their arrest at Bangkok airport in
February 1993. Miss Gregory, whose family live near Aberdeen, has admitted
trafficking but Mr Lock denies the charges.
Skydiver lives
ALLENTOWN: A skydiver who couldn't open his parachute survived a 3000ft plunge
into a snowy field. Bruce Charles's back-up parachute partially opened just
before he hit the ground. That and a foot-deep cushion of snow saved his life,
said fellow skydivers in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Charles, 56, was in hospital
with injuries to his legs, hips, and back, but was expected to jump again.
Poll date set
MADRID: Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain announced a General Election on
March 3, signalling what could be the end of his 13-year Socialist rule. The
poll, at least a year early, looks likely to bring the centre-right Popular
Party to power.
Flu hits Ukraine
KIEV: Two million Ukrainians, one-third of them children, have fallen ill with
flu in an epidemic which has claimed five lives. Although the outbreak appeared
to be winding down, doctors have been unable to find a vaccine to combat the
rare and virulent strain. Meanwhile, at least 99 people have died of frostbite
after blizzards hit northern Kazakhstan.
Pilot saved
ATHENS: A Greek rescue helicopter picked up a Turkish pilot who had ejected
with his co-pilot when their Phantom fighter aircraft developed mechanical
problems near the Greek island of Lesbos yesterday. A search continued for the
second pilot.
Tribute to Martin
LOS ANGELES: Frank Sinatra and his wife Barbara, Shirley MacLaine, and former
comedy partner Jerry Lewis were among friends expected to attend a private
service in Los Angeles for Dean Martin. Several Las Vegas hotel-casinos were
dimming their lights for 10 minutes in honour of the legendary performer, who
died on Monday.
Stowaways safe
PARIS: Five Moroccans who stowed away in a container on a cargo ship bound for
Rotterdam were saved from death after the captain heard their cries for help.
French authorities had at first refused the Saarbreda permission to unload the
container when the ship docked in Brest, but later relented.
Suspect held
CAPE TOWN: South African police have arrested an armed robber wanted in
connection with the murder of a British winemaker and several other violent
attacks over the last year. Steven Rainbird, from Sussex, was killed at
Goedvertrouen Farm near Stellenbosch, where he was on an exchange programme.
Flood alert
DURBAN: Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes in South
Africa's Zulu heartland after swollen rivers again rose to dangerously high
levels. Police, fearing a repeat of the flood that killed at least 124 people
living on the banks of the Umsunduzi river, used loudhailers to urge people to
leave.
Bomb suspects
RENO: Two men from Gardnerville, Nevada, have been arrested for allegedly
planting a powerful bomb at the Reno office of the US tax agency on December
18. The fuse of the bomb had been lit, but it went out. Investigators have
refused to confirm reports that it was packed with the same fuel used in the
Oklahoma City blast that killed 169 people.

MUNICH: A German security van driver helped himself to an early Christmas
present by grabbing #1m from his vehicle and replacing the cash with scrap
paper, police said. His firm, near Munich, did not find the paper shreds until
Wednesday. The driver is thought to have fled the country.
Activists arrested
LAGOS: Five pro-democracy activists in Nigeria have been arrested over a banned
rally. They are thought to include the acting leader of the Campaign for
Democracy pressure group. Meanwhile, Nigeria has been excluded from a
Commonwealth meeting of parliamentary Speakers in Cyprus next week because of
human rights abuses.
Killer wolf loose
BUDAPEST: People in the Hungarian town of Pecs were warned to stay indoors
after a wolf escaped from a zoo. It killed an elderly woman, seriously injured
three children, and bit several other people in nearby woods.

<RECORDNO>974651420</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ANNOUNCING the creation of a memorial park in his first New Year message as
Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Michael Forsyth recalled how much he had
been moved by the veterans he met while carrying out his first public duty at
the VJ Day ceremonies earlier this year:
``VE Day and VJ Day left a lasting impression on me and I found myself
wondering during the following weeks what fitting memorial we could create in
Scotland, in the 50th anniversary year of the victorious conclusion of the
Second World War, to those who fought and in many cases lost their lives in
that conflict. Then I became aware of the history of the former Rowardennan
estate on the east bank of Loch Lomond.
``Because of its outstanding quality, this land was purchased by the Government
in 1950 under the terms of the National Land Fund `to preserve the natural
beauty of the area, safeguard public access, and utilise the land for forestry
and agriculture'. Today the land is owned by Forest Enterprise and the National
Trust for Scotland. At my request, these bodies have agreed to undertake the
management of the area in partnership, with a view to creating a major national
monument.
``I am pleased, therefore, to announce our intention to establish the Ben
Lomond National Memorial Park, dedicated to the memory of all those who served
our country in the Second World War. The memorial park will be based on
conservation principles, giving priority to landscape, nature conservation, and
quiet recreation. An integrated management strategy will include a project for
increasing the native woodland areas within the park.
``We shall also be launching a national competition to devise a memorial to the
fallen as a focal point to the park. Future generations will be able to enjoy
this superb environment, while recalling the sacrifices that were made to
secure for us our present liberties and quality of life.
``That inheritance can no longer be taken for granted. Once again, our way of
life is threatened - this time by an enemy within. The drugs epidemic is a
scourge as terrible as any medieval plague.
``Let us, as a nation, make a New Year resolution that 1996 is the year in
which we will turn back the tide of drug abuse which is engulfing our young
people and threatening our civilisation.
``We must unite across party lines and across every age group to drive the drug
barons out of our communities. This is not a campaign: it is a crusade.
``We must rediscover the spirit of wartime unity. I am delighted that the
leaders of all the political parties in Scotland are keen to join forces to
launch a major new national initiative against drugs. Scotland Against Drugs
will seek to unite communities in fighting drugs misuse.
The success of local anti-drugs campaigns, notably those run by the Glasgow
Evening Times and the Paisley Daily Express, has paved the way to a nationwide
effort.
``It will be launched in January under the auspices of the Health Education
Board for Scotland, linking into the work of agencies which are already
involved in the fight against drugs.''
Paying tribute to the successful lobbying campaigns by Highland region over the
Fort William sleeper and the Scotch Whisky Association over excise duty, Mr
Forsyth turned his attention to the economy.
``The Scottish economy is a success story. The latest export figures, for 1994,
show a leap of almost 24% over the previous year to more than #14bn. We now
export more per head than Japan - who would have imagined that 10 years ago?
``During the last year, unemployment fell below 200,000 to its lowest level in
15 years; that means a happier New Year for many Scottish households than was
the case in previous years. Scotland's unemployment rate has now been below
that of the United Kingdom for almost four years and long-term unemployment is
falling.
``My own resolution for 1996 is to make our country safer.
``Maintenance of law and order is the first duty of Government. That is why, in
the year ahead, we shall be ensuring that the punishment fits the crime and
that criminals do not walk out of prison half-way through their sentences.
Drugs can never be tolerated in prisons; random drug testing is our answer.
``We must give strong support to the police. That is why we are putting 500
more officers on to the streets and giving them the technological help they
need, such as DNA testing facilities and automatic fingerprint reading
machines. Let us make a resolution that 1996 will be a very bad year for
criminals in Scotland.
``The successes of 1995 point the way ahead for 1996. In a spirit of
partnership rather than dissension we must persevere in securing Scotland's
interests and liberating the talents and enterprise of our people to make our
country stable and prosperous. That is the spirit in which I ask you to join
with me in striving to make 1996, for everyone in Scotland, a truly happy New
Year.''

POLICE are linking two gun incidents in Lanarkshire on Wed-nesday night, the
first in which a shotgun was fired through the lounge window of a house in
Hamilton and the second, half-an-hour later, in which a car was hijacked at
gunpoint on the A8.
In the first incident, the lounge window of a house in Abbotsford Avenue,
Hamilton, was shattered after a shotgun was fired at close range.
Three people were in the living room at the time - two women and a man - but
none was injured.
Thirty minutes later, a 35-year-old man who stopped at the scene of an accident
on the A8 near Calderbank was robbed of his vehicle after being threatened with
what appeared to be a shotgun.

THE saddest story this Christmas has ended happily. It concerns a 12-year-old
boy called Michael Ross who was abandoned at a bus station in Salt Lake City
last week. His parents gave him a note saying that they could no longer care
for him, that they were throwing themselves, or him, on the mercy of strangers.
Michael wandered the streets for hours, at last presenting himself and his sad
little note at a social services office. He showed his birth certificate, and
reported that he had never been to school as the family led a nomadic
existence, moving from city to city, always homeless.
The good citizens of Utah took the waif to their hearts. The boy was pampered
and indulged for Christmas, and offers of help
poured in from all over the country. Kind people sent money or offered to
adopt
him. Officials set up a trust fund to administer the donations, and the local
paper set up a fund for him.
All very touching, all very sad. Who could have abandoned the lovely boy? Now
comes the denouement: the boy is a woman, aged 25, who has played the same
trick in at least 11 other states.
The great state of Utah feels rather foolish, but everyone else is grateful
for
this moment of seasonal merriment. A further delight is that the culprit's
real name is Birdie Jo Hoaks.
The hoax was exposed when newspapers in Vermont published the story. Local
authorities there called Salt Lake City. They had heard the story before.
Indeed, Ms Hoaks had spent a few days in jail in Vermont on the charge of
lying
to officials.
Then other states called in. She had been sentenced to nine months for
deception in South Dakota. She had been caught in Kansas when doctors examined
her. Other states, as far apart as Texas and Maine, also reported that she had
tried the same scam. A Boston newspaper reported in 1993 that Ms Hoaks had a
twin sister, Becky, and that they roamed the country claiming they were lost
boys.
Ms Hoaks called a Utah TV station to defend herself: she said that a
young-looking homeless woman was in constant danger, and was better off posing
as a boy.
We have now seen her on television, and she does not look at all like the girl
disguised as a boy in The Swiss Family Robinson. Those very dense Swiss boys
had no excuse, but all those people in Utah, Vermont, and everywhere else can
be forgiven: Ms Hoaks looks just like a rather pudgy teenage boy.
She has been charged with lying and sent to jail. She could be sentenced to 15
years. The only remaining questions are why she kept trying the same scam,
after repeated failures; and which TV network will be first with The Birdie
Hoaks Hoax.

EDINBURGH'S six-day Hogmanay celebrations kicked off last night with a warning
to revellers taking part in the festivities.
Hundreds of thousands of people are expected in the capital over the next few
days to take part in events like the open-air fair at the east end of Princes
Street.
Assistant Chief Constable Tom Wood warned people attending late-night events
over the next few days to be wary of the dangers of the freezing winter
temperatures.
Mr Wood said that, particularly on New Year's Eve, when 200,000 people are
expected in Princes Street, special precautions should be taken.
Police in Lothian also appealed to relatives and friends of the elderly and
infirm to check up on them regularly.

THERE were renewed calls yesterday for a complete overhaul of the Government's
cold-weather payment scheme.
Mrs Margaret Ewing, parliamentary leader of the Scottish National Party,
announced she would be introducing a new Cold Climate Allowance Bill in the
next parliamentary session.
She said: ``The winter chaos and discomfort this year has been compounded by
the Government's ramshackle cold-weather payments system. This system, which is
manifestly unfair, given the need for sub-zero temperatures for seven
consecutive days before payments are triggered, has been shown to be totally
inadequate by the extreme conditions over recent days.
``Last year, during what was a relatively mild winter, 239 Scots died of
hypothermia - a cold statistic which is a damning indictment of the negligible
support provided by the UK Government.''
As the controversy raged, a soup kitchen was set up at Cliasmol School by a
band of worried volunteers on Harris. Soup and food was being handed out to
shivering locals and electricity company workers battling to restore power to
50 homes on the island.
The SNP proposes weekly payments in southern Scotland from December to March of
#7.40, and #11.15 in northern Scotland. ``The total cost of such a system in
Scotland would be #170m per annum - less than 6% of the expected #3000m in
North Sea revenues next year,'' said Mrs Ewing.
Meanwhile, Mr David Logan, convener of the Campaign for Cold-Weather Credits,
called for a system to ensure that people on benefit could afford to burn
enough fuel to keep warm during the winter months.
Ross, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy yesterday joined Western Isles MP
Calum Macdonald in demanding action from the Prime Minister and Social Security
Secretary Peter Lilley over the failure of Stornoway and Tiree weather
monitoring stations to trigger cold-weather payments.
The Tiree station acts as the trigger for a large part of central and Wester
Ross and Mr Kennedy said that he would now be writing to Mr Lilley asking for a
joint meeting when Parliament resumes. Mr Macdonald has already written to the
Prime Minister.
Mr Kennedy said: ``For years, I have been campaigning in Parliament for this
trigger point to be changed. It is clearly insane that Tiree should be used as
a guide for areas and communities like Garve, Torridon, and Ullapool.
``Successive Social Security Ministers have tried to maintain the nonsensical
proposition that Tiree could be regarded as indicative for these parts of my
constituency. That never was a remotely tenable argument and this latest
breathtaking revelation kills it stone dead once and for all.
``I fully endorse Calum's call for a prime ministerial intervention and I am
working with him on this twin-track approach involving Peter Lilley as well.
The immediate crisis must be put right by urgent ministerial intervention.
Thereafter, we need a complete reassessment of the weather station monitoring
map, self-evidently a discredited fiction.
``This entire fiasco would have been turned down as an episode for Yes Minister
on the grounds that it would be too far-fetched. It would be funny if it wasn't
so serious and downright unjust for people losing out in such a blatant
fashion.''
Shetland communities yesterday were continuing to help each other to cope with
the severe storms, which have left many homes isolated. In spite of further
snow falls, the situation was improving.
A Hydro-Electric spokes-woman said last night all electricity supplies on
Shetland had been restored.
She added that work was still being done to restore power to about 50 homes in
the Western Isles.
As food convoys left Lerwick to remote areas, Shetland Islands Council was
monitoring the situation to decide whether or not it would need to accept
external offers of help, including the use of troops.
Yesterday, Shetland coastguard continued to take over the role of the local
ambulances unable to operate on snowbound roads by airlifting two elderly
women, one from West Burra and the other from Sandwick, to hospital in Lerwick.
They also carried out a number of other medical evacuations.
Mr Derek Cox, the director of public health, urged the elderly to keep their
heating on to ensure they were warm.
He said one of the dangers was that some elderly people were not aware of how
cold they were becoming and because they didn't shiver they didn't have the
sensation of being cold and could slip into hypothermia.
However, he said the network of GPs, health workers, and home helps throughout
the islands were being very successful in checking on the welfare of anyone who
might give cause for concern.
Mr Bill Bennett, the council's director of social work, echoed that message. He
said: ``Those on income support should not worry about fuel bills but should
contact the social work department for assistance.''
Chief Inspector William Murray, of Northern Constabulary, said the response to
the emergency had been a co-ordinated effort and public safety remained of
paramount concern. The police urged people in rural areas to make contact with
neighbours to ensure they had adequate warmth and food supplies.
They also issued a warning that people should not travel unless absolutely
necessary to leave roads clear for the snow ploughs.
Shetland Islands Council is concentrating on clearing the main spine roads
throughout Shetland and yesterday they were passable by four-wheel-drive
vehicles. The worst hit area is to the west, where some areas are still
inaccessible.
Mr Joe Gray, director of roads and transport, said the council was doing its
best to deal with all inquiries. The isles of Skerries and Whalsay had supplies
delivered by ferry and arrangements have been made for similar deliveries to
Yell and Unst today.
Yesterday, a convoy of essential supplies from wholesalers in Lerwick was
delivered to rural shops with snow ploughs leading the way to clear any hazards.
This morning, 1500 propane and butane gas cylinders will arrive by ferry from
Aberdeen to help ease the shortage caused by the weather. Sumburgh Airport was
open yesterday and the local bus company was able to operate between Lerwick
and the airport.

TWO operas originally produced in Theresienstadt, a Nazi transit camp in
Czechoslovakia, are among several arts projects to have benefited financially
from the main teachers' union this school session.
The one-act works received #1000 from the Educational Institute of Scotland
(EIS), which each year gives up to 0.5% of its income from members'
subscriptions to arts projects.
To qualify for assistance, projects must involve school pupils as participants
or have them as their target audience.
One of the operas, Brundibar, involves 40 central region pupils aged between
eight and 14. Other projects supported this session include:
q The Scottish Southern Counties Burns Association, which received #500 for the
forthcoming Burns for Bairns event involving Dumfries pupils;
q TAG Theatre Company in Glasgow, #900 to cover the cost of a teachers' pack
for the play Scottish Women Artists of the Twentieth Century;
q Inverness Festival Association, #1000 for non-competitive events for the
forthcoming festival such as the gala evening concert or classes in clarsach,
accordion, fiddle, and music making.

<HEADLINE>MP to raise case of ambulanceman who lost his job</HEADLINE>

THE case of an ambulanceman who lost his job on Christmas Day is to be raised
in Parliament.
Father-of-two Allan Bruce, 44, had been serving one of the most remote corners
of the Highlands from the depot at the fishing port of Kinlochbervie, in
north-west Sutherland.
His contract was terminated on December 25 but his MP, Mr Robert Maclennan, has
now had questions to the House of Commons accepted by speaker Betty Boothroyd.
The move comes as Mr Bruce prepares for an industrial tribunal, which has been
set for January 30.
Local GPs are also backing his fight to be reinstated. Dr Brian Fitzsimons
said: ``We have lost a very capable and efficient driver. There is no way we
will get anybody better. The whole thing is a disgrace.''
Mr Bruce has been employed by the Scottish Ambulance Service on a contract
basis, covering north-west Sutherland, since 1991. He has twice taken the
service to industrial tribunals in the past as he attempted to be made up to
employee level.
Mr John Drummond, a spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service, said: ``We
reserve the right to pick and choose the right people for the right job. Mr
Bruce did not meet the standard required. It is as simple as that.''
Mr Maclennan, Liberal Democrat MP for Caithness and Sutherland, said: ``I
regard this as a scandalous case. I have spoken to local doctors, who say Mr
Bruce is a dedicated and competent public servant. I will put forward the
strongest possible case for him to be reinstated to Scots Health Minister Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton.''
Mr Bruce, his wife, Cathy, and their two children, Donna, 16, and Ewan, 12, now
face an uncertain future.
The ambulance service in the more remote parts of the Highlands was usually
provided by self-employed contractors. More recently, the Scottish Ambulance
Service has been employing staff men to do the job.

A SEARCH in the cellar of Alistair MacLean's mansion on the shores of Lake
Geneva has produced three short stories that were unknown to anyone but the
author - and a complete screenplay that could yet take its place alongside The
Guns Of Navarone and Where Eagles Dare.
The discovery was made by MacLean's friend and literary executor, Mr David
Bishop, of London lawyers Baileys Shaw and Gillett, when he went to visit the
late author's first wife, Gisela, who has continued to live in the magnificent
Villa Murat since they were divorced in 1972.
The short stories date back to the 1950s, when MacLean was a young
schoolteacher at Gallowflat School in Rutherglen. It was in 1954 that he first
burst into print as the winner of The Glasgow Herald short-story competition,
chosen from nearly 1000 entries.
His story was seen by Mr Ian Chapman of Collins the publisher, who persuaded
him to try his hand at a novel. A reluctant MacLean finally delivered a
manuscript, which turned out to be HMS Ulysses, destined to sell 250,000
hardback copies within six months and become one of the best-selling books of
all time.
``Around that period, Alistair had been reeling off short stories,'' Mr Bishop
told me. ``But with the excitement of the Herald prize - and his immediate
success as a world-class novelist - he obviously forgot about the other short
stories.
``I knew nothing about them. My main reason for going to his old home at the
village of Celigny, overlooking the lake, was to see if I could find the
missing screenplay, which was written by MacLean in 1968 and taken up as an
option by Elliott Kastner, the film producer of Where Eagles Dare and When
Eight Bells Toll.
``It had been lost in Kastner's office, apparently thrown out by a secretary
when they were moving premises. I thought there must be another copy somewhere.
``Some years ago, I asked Gisela MacLean if she could search the house but she
had no success. Convinced there must be a copy there, I then decided to go to
Geneva, where she agreed that I could make my own search.
``MacLean's old papers had been flung into the rather damp, evil-smelling
cellar, most of them untouched since Alistair and Gisela arrived from Britain
in 1969. With MacLean's son Alistair, I began to search the cellar, came across
proofs of most of his novels - and then found those unknown short stories.''
The good news for readers of The Herald is that we have decided to take this
literary romance full circle. Back where Alistair MacLean's phenomenal career
started nearly 42 years ago - the pages of the Weekend section - we are
publishing two of the new-found stories tomorrow and next Saturday.
The Black Storm and The Good Samaritan clearly belong to the 1950s, all the
more interesting as a study of the early efforts of a quiet schoolmaster who
would break out of the Scottish classroom to earn #20m between 1955 and his
death in 1987, when he was 64.
To complete the fruitful visit to Switzerland, Mr Bishop did indeed find the
missing screenplay of The Swashbuckler, which owed its origins to hell-raising
Hollywood producer Kastner, who played a vital part in MacLean's success in
films.
For it was Kastner who, in the mid-sixties, persuaded the Scottish author to
try writing a screenplay before turning the film into a novel. He even gave him
the idea for the first one, Where Eagles Dare, though literary purists reckoned
that this reversal of the process led to a deterioration in MacLean's novels.
Kastner nevertheless produced When Eight Bells Toll (introducing Anthony
Hopkins in his first major film) and commissioned MacLean to write two old-time
screenplays - Breakheart Pass, which became a major movie with Charles Bronson,
and the pirate story, which was titled The Swashbuckler before it was
carelessly thrown out.
Now American film agents are taking a look at this piece of unexpected MacLean
writing to see if it fits alongside his other major movie successes.

A MOTHER stricken by conscience may hold a vital clue to the identity of the
killer of Kilmarnock schoolgirl Mhairi Julyan.
The detective leading the murder inquiry yesterday disclosed that a letter,
apparently written by a concerned mother, had been received by the Julyan
family at their home in the town's Samson Avenue.
Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder said the letter had been posted in the
Kilmarnock area earlier this week and had been received by Mhairi's parents on
Wednesday morning.
He declined to discuss the contents of the anonymous letter in detail but said
there were ``very clear indications'' that the letter came from a concerned
mother who had important information about the identity of the killer.
Mr Lauder added: ``It is vital that the author of this letter gets in touch
with me at the incident room as soon as possible in order that I can discuss
the contents of the letter with her.
``I assure this person that the information will be treated in the strictest
confidence and I will be happy to meet her anywhere at any time to have a
discussion about what she has written and what she knows.
``My message to the woman who wrote this letter is clear - it is important that
the person who carried out this awful crime is dealt with and while I know it
is a major hurdle, you must force yourself to get over it and contact us at
once . . . it will give you peace of mind as well as helping the Julyan family
and the entire community to come to terms with the loss of a young girl.
``It will not bring her back but I believe it will help if we can bring this
inquiry to a conclusion.''
Meantime, the murder squad, boosted by detectives from every division of
Strathclyde as well as the Major Crime Resource Unit, will assess the
information contained in the letter and follow up other important leads.
Mr Lauder conceded there was a possibility the letter was not genuine and
added: ``If that is the case, it would be a quite dreadful hoax to perpetrate
on a grieving family.''
He said it was unusual for such a communication to be received by the victim's
family, although sympathy cards and messages of support had come from the
immediate area and beyond.
Mr Lauder said another possible sighting of Mhairi - this time at the junction
of London Road and Nursery Avenue - on the evening of December 16 had been
reported.
He again urged anyone with the slightest piece of information to get in touch.
``No-one should think they are cluttering up the inquiry by making a call.
Their small piece of information could be vital.
``We are not going to go away. We are here until the person is found and the
inquiry closed.''
Mhairi, a fifth-year pupil at Kilmarnock Academy, disappeared on December 16
while on her way home from a pantomime at the Palace Theatre.
Her body was discovered in the Stagecoach bus depot in McKinlay Place, a few
hundred yards from her home, the next afternoon.
q A father yesterday made an emotional appeal for the safe return of his
teenage daughter who disappeared after a Christmas Eve disco.
Delivery driver Robert Smith, 49, pleaded for news of his daughter Louise, 18,
at a police news conference.
In a personal message, he said: ``Louise, we all love you. Please get in touch
by any means. We want you back.''
She disappeared early onChristmas morning following the disco at Spirals
nightclub in the heart of Yate, near Bristol.
Police are investigating the possibility that she was sighted shortly after 2am
in the passenger seat of a blue Ford Escort driven by a female friend called
Emma. Police are still trying to trace the friend and the car.

Jerusalem, Thursday.  ISRAEL reported a ``positive atmosphere'' at its first
talks with Syria in six months, saying that Syrian peacemakers appeared to be
freer to negotiate than before.
Despite a news blackout on the closed-door talks at a remote conference centre
an hour's drive from Washington, Israeli Cabinet Ministers were quick to
describe the atmosphere as ``truly good'', ``positive'', and ``business-like''.
``It's the feeling of our people that the Syrian delegation to the talks is
coming with a broader mandate than in similar talks in the past,'' said Yossi
Beilin, spokesman for Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
He said it was too soon to know whether the talks would lead to a breakthrough.
``What it's posssible to speak of now is a positive atmosphere, a feeling that
there is a mandate there for serious negotiations.''
Shortly before the talks started, Syria said it was optimistic about the
negotiations and hoped they would break a four-year impasse.
``We can't predict the results of the talks now, but we are optimistic,''
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara told reporters in Damascus last night.
Peres said today that peace with Syria would open the door for the Jewish state
to end decades of hostility with the Arab world.
``If we achieve peace with Syria and Lebanon there is absolutely no reason for
a state of enmity, threat, or boycott to remain. I believe this is the
appropriate opportunity to put an end to 50 years of blood and hatred,'' Peres
told the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper.
A second round of talks in Maryland is scheduled next week and US Secretary of
State Warren Christopher will meet leaders in Israel and Syria next
month.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Milestone for lottery brings new betting plea</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974651430</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AS sales of National Lottery tickets topped #5000m since being launched 13
months ago, bookmakers made a fresh plea for changes in the law to help them
fight for a bigger share of the gaming market.
Weekly jackpot ticket sales have reached #3700m, while sales of the nine
Instants scratch card games have totalled #1300m since the lottery started in
November 1994.
Camelot communications director David Rigg said: ``This is a fantastic
achievement, in just over a year, which demonstrates the huge appeal and
popularity of the lottery.''
It has become so much part of the daily lives of a vast number of Britons that
it is having an impact on our language.
More than 292 million people have won a total of #2300m on the lottery and
#1346m has been raised for the five good causes.
The Treasury has taken #600m in tax and #250m has been paid in commission to
the 28,000 retailers who sell the tickets.
Camelot hopes to boost its lottery success with the launch of a 10th Instants
scratch card today.
The Yellow Instants, with a top prize of #50,000, follow on from the blue, red,
and green designs.
Since the launch of Instants games last March, 224 people have won the top
prize - and 32% have said they would blow their winnings on a dream holiday.
However, bookmakers are unhappy because the rising popularity of the lottery
has been accompanied by a downturn in the fortunes of the bookmaking industry.
Turnover has been hit heavily and although Chancellor Kenneth Clarke softened
the blow with a 1% reduction in betting duty in the Budget last month, William
Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe has reiterated the call for further concessions to
be made to enable the bookmaking industry to redress the balance.
``I have nothing against the National Lottery, and I am very glad it has been
such a success,'' he said, ``but what we want is for the Government to allow us
to compete on equal terms.
``While bookmakers have had to obey a set of tight regulations since being
permitted to open in 1961, the National Lottery has had the advantage of a
large number of concessions that have been denied to us, along with the pools
and bingo industries and casinos.
``The National Lottery has the advantage of radio and television advertising,
not to mention the draw on Saturday night. Now there are talks of a midweek
draw.
``At first, the Government tried to pretend that the Lottery was not gambling
and its age limit was put at 16. We believe the age limit should be 18 and,
although there have been problems with under-age players of the lottery, that
has not been a problem in betting shops, where the age limit is 18.
The concession made by the Chancellor in the Budget, though welcome, is
insufficient, argued Sharpe.
``We originally wanted a 2% cut in betting duty, to allow us to regain some of
the balance. In 1995, we have taken 20 million fewer betting slips than we did
in 1994 and that is just William Hill. It is a very serious matter for the long
term.
``The National Lottery will always be a success, so why should Camelot be
concerned just because we are permitted to compete on equal terms?''
Mr Tom Kelly, chairman of the Betting Office Licensees' Association, echoed Mr
Sharpe's call for a further reduction in betting duty: ``This is a serious
situation which will get worse before it stabilises. The National Lottery has
changed the gambling culture in this country.''
It has also changed the language. New words associated with the lottery and
those which have new meanings derived from it are to be included in new
editions of dictionaries.
Chambers and the other two main dictionary publishers, The Oxford English and
Collins, have said their next full editions will contain ``lotteryisms'' such
as ``instant'', ``Oflot'' and ``rollover''.
q DUMBARTON District Council has scooped #220,000 from the Sports Lottery Fund
to redevelop Posties Park at Levengrove.
The red blaes track will be converted into a six-lane synthetic layout with a
grassed central area for field events.
The council also picked up #80,000 from the National Lottery, which will help
with the refurbishment of the town's Denny Civic Theatre. The money will be
used to upgrade the foyer area with the creation of a new box office and bar.

TOUGH measures to reduce delays in processing planning applications were
announced yesterday by Mr George Kynoch, Scottish Local Government Minister.
The changes, detailed in a review of the town and country planning system,
include performance targets along with tighter timetables for dealing with
planning applications and appeals.
\Performance targets will cover the progress of structure plan reviews,
national guidance and advice, decisions on individual cases as well as the work
of the Scottish Office Inquiry Reporters' Unit.
According to the Scottish Office, good progress has been made in this area and
work will continue towards meeting the target of 28 weeks for public local
inquiry cases by the end of 1996.
Once met, it is intended to tighten further the target for written submission
cases to 26 weeks.

ROADSIDE searches have failed to yield any clues in the search for missing
French student Celine Figard.
Police from three counties yesterday spent a second fruitless day combing halts
where heavy goods vehicles might stop - but Celine's father Bernard has refused
to give up hope of finding his daughter alive.
The 19-year-old accountancy student was last seen on Tuesday, December 19, at
the Chieveley Service Station on the junction of the M4 and A34 near Newbury,
Berkshire.
Celine, who was travelling to Fordingbridge, Hampshire, to spend Christmas with
her cousin, was given a lift in a white Mercedes truck which was pulling a
refrigerated trailer.
She has not been seen since and police now fear she has been murdered.
Police are are still trying to trace the driver who, despite appeals, has
failed to contact them.
The latest search has concentrated on routes leading from the service area to
Salisbury.
Hundreds of calls have been taken at the police incident room in Southampton
since an emotional plea for help on Tuesday by Mr Figard, a 44-year-old farmer.
He said yesterday: ``I can never give up hope. If the lorry driver would only
come forward, it is possible she may be found.''
Celine had been given a lift from her home in the small village of
Ferrieres-Les-Scey, 200 miles south-east of Paris, to Folkestone by a lorry
driver friend of her family. He put her in the care of another French driver
who took her to the Chieveley service area.
A new likeness of the Mercedes driver was issued yesterday. It shows him
without the previously described ``chin strap'' beard. The move came after the
second French driver who gave Celine a lift said he may actually have been
clean shaven.
Last night, police said the total number of calls offering information had
risen to more than 1250 but there were still no clues to Celine's whereabouts.
A spokesman said there had been more calls than they could cope with and added:
``We are keeping an open mind on our enquiries at the moment.''

West Plains, Thursday
RUSS COCHRAN was not telling the whole truth when he told hospital workers in
West Plains, Missouri, that the tightly wrapped bundle in his arms was a
seriously ill baby.
When doctors at Ozarks Medical Centre peeled back the blankets, they discovered
Buck, Cochran's two-month-old pet chimpanzee.
However Buck was critically ill, and the medical staff decided to help him.
``This definitely is not our policy, treating animals,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Cathy Stahl. ``It was an isolated incident and a judgment call.''
Buck, who had developed breathing problems after milk got into his lungs when
he was being fed, was given oxgen and a chest X-ray.
Later he was being cared for in St Louis by a vet and a paediatrician.
Cochran, who had taken the chimp to hospital after his condition worsened while
waiting for a vet, said: ``He's healthy. He's strong.''-AP.

THE first week of Nato's Bosnia mission ended on a high note today after
warring parties pulled back from Sarajevo front-line flashpoints on time.
However the Alliance encountered a setback from ``General Winter'' as rain and
melting snow threatened to slow deployment of the main body of peace troops,
eventually to number 60,000.
Serb and Muslim-led government forces withdrew from all 40 designated hot spots
on the Sarajevo front-line by a deadline of midnight yesterday, seen as a first
test of their willingness to honour the Dayton peace agreement.
Nato today confirmed that both sides had complied 100% with the pull-back in
the Bosnian capital.
Diplomats cautioned against early euphoria, however, saying other forthcoming
deadlines, particularly one for the return of Serb-held suburbs of Sarajevo to
government rule within 90 days, could be testing for both sides.
``We are in early days, it is a honeymoon period,'' said the commander of Nato
ground forces, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Walker.
President Bill Clinton suspended US sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro,
but warned that they could be re-imposed if terms of the Bosnian peace accord
were violated.
Across the Bosnian border in Croatia, floods today burst into a camp for US
troops building a pontoon bridge to bring in thousands of their compatriots, in
a second weather-related blow to the mission in 24 hours.
Yesterday French helicopters had to rescue scores of Foreign Legionnaires when
floods swept through their tented camp near the divided city of Mostar in south
Bosnia.
US officials vowed to complete the bridge near the Croatian town of Zupanja, a
key link in a corridor bringing 20,000 American troops from rear bases in
Germany to their planned headquarters at Tuzla, north-east Bosnia.
However further delays looked likely after floods swept into a riverside camp
at Zupanja.
``The water broke through the levee (banks) and flooded the camp. The camp was
evacuated overnight. Everybody got out safely,'' Colonel Timothy Lamb told
reporters.-Reuter.

Woman's body
found in woods
THE body of a young woman who disappeared at about the same time as her
estranged husband was found dead in a fume-filled car - with a note suggesting
he had harmed her - has been found in woods, say police.
Detectives believe the body to be that of 26-year-old Jacqueline Phillips, who
disappeared from her home in Doncaster, Yorkshire, in August.
Plea bargain
THIEVES who took George Formby fan David Edelston's ukuleles have made sure he
got them back after his public plea, by phoning and telling him they were in a
rubbish skip near his Leeds home. He found the #1000 instruments undamaged.
Widow's post
THE widow of Falklands VC hero Colonel ``H'' Jones, Mrs Sara Jones, is to head
the Royal British Legion's Poppy Factory.
Red tape offer
THE Government yesterday invited voters to tell it which bits of official red
tape they would like to see scrapped in 1996 - the year for tackling burdens on
small business.
Robber jailed
AN Edinburgh man was jailed for 18 months at the city's sheriff court yesterday
when he admitted a knifepoint robbery, assaulting a policeman, and carrying an
offensive weapon. David Pentland, 23, of Viewcraig Gardens, Edinburgh, had been
released from psychiatric hospital two days before the robbery.
Net awards
STORNOWAY skipper Calum Campbell of the Northern Star won two out of the four
annual awards at the town's fisherman's ball. Other winners were Donald
Morrison of the Scalpay boat Agate, and Stornoway's D C MacLeod of the Sharon
Rose.
Knife attack
KNIFE attacker Raymond Boyd, of Methven, in Perthshire, has been sent to the
High Court for sentence following his assault on a fellow body-builder who,
Boyd had been told, had been seeing his girlfriend.
Top names
JACK and Jessica were the most popular names for babies born in 1995. Both
names rose from third place in 1994 to claim top spots in the boys' and girls'
lists as last year's favourites Thomas and Rebecca slipped back to third.
Hunt for girl
A 16-year-old girl who has been missing for 19 days from her home in Edinburgh
was being sought by police last night. Lisa Blyth was last seen at her home in
the Howdenhall area of the city in the early evening of December 9. Police have
appealed for information from anyone who knows of her whereabouts.
Village boost
FIFE'S former mining villages are getting a #1.5m facelift aimed at attracting
new business investment throughout Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy districts.
Poverty claim
THE number of children receiving free school meals has risen by more than 90%
in parts of England and Wales over the past five years, figures show today.
Labour said the figures were evidence that child poverty had made dramatic
inroads into the south in the 1990s.

NATIONAL health and local authority employers are experiencing increasing
difficulty in recruiting certain professional grades, according to the annual
public-sector labour market survey by Incomes Data Services.
The shortages have been particularly acute in certain sectors of the health
service, where the most common problem was the lack of sufficient
physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and psychologists. Specialist
qualified nursing staff were also in short supply in some parts.
Out of 76 NHS organisations (together employing 170,000), 62 said they had
difficulties recruiting and retaining certain types of staff.
This continues a sharply rising trend, evident over the past two years, which
respondents put down to:
q A continuing national shortfall of staff being trained;
q The spread of fixed-term contracts which mean the NHS is no longer seen as a
``job for life'';
q Improved economic services leading to a tighter labour market and increased
turnover.
A recent Institute of Personnel and Development survey showed that staff
turnover in NHS trusts stood at 19.1% compared to an average of 13.8%
throughout the rest of the public sector.
Of 56 councils, together employing about 400,000 staff, which took part in the
IDS survey, one third said they had problems of recruitment and retention of
certain groups compared with a quarter last year.
Recruitment problems were appearing in a wider number of occupational groups,
with a number of councils mentioning difficulties in filling low-paid part-time
posts, where previously problems had been confined to professional and
technical groups. Shortages occurred in groups as diverse as civil engineers,
cleaners, information technology specialists, cooks, solicitors, and gipsy site
staff.

SCOTS are the least concerned about the environment, while people in East
Anglia are the most worried, states a new survey.
More than one in five Scots were not even ``slightly concerned'' about the
environment and only 39% were either extremely or very concerned, according to
the survey from Friends of the Earth.
In contrast, people in East Anglia were the most worried about green matters,
with 52% being either extremely or very concerned and a further 42% being
slightly concerned. This meant only 6% were not worried at all.
For the purposes of the survey, Britain was divided into television company
areas. The survey showed that across England, Wales, and Scotland, 54% of
people were either extremely or very worried about the environment and a
further 34% were slightly concerned.
The survey also showed that 91% of people agreed that pollution from cars was a
very or fairly serious problem and three-quarters of the people questioned felt
that the Government should be responsibile for solving environmental problems,
with 63% feeling that it was not doing a lot to help.

THE #3m public inquiry into plans by ScottishPower to build an electricity link
between Scotland and Ireland was attacked last night as ``a complete farce''.
The criticism came from Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and
Doon Valley, after he had read a 250-page draft report of the five-month-long
public inquiry held earlier this year.
Mr Foulkes said: ``The Scottish Office Reporter has swallowed the ScottishPower
case hook, line, and sinker. The so-called findings of fact and related
conclusions all point in one direction, and clearly indicate that the
application will be approved.''
He added: ``It is increasingly clear this inquiry has been a farce and a total
waste of time and money.''
If the plan gets the go-ahead from Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth it would
result in a 40-mile line of pylons cutting through some of the most picturesque
countryside in Scotland.
Mr Foulkes vowed: ``The fight will go on and we will be challenging the
conclusions we consider to be incorrect.
``Apart from that, this report has been overtaken by recent events around the
Beaufort's Dyke munitions dump.''
Mr Foulkes maintains that munitions which have been washed up on Scottish
beaches were disturbed by the laying of a gas pipeline between Scotland and
Ireland. The new electricity link is due to be laid about four miles from the
gas line.
Mr Foulkes said: ``We now know that the dangers from dumped munitions and
chemicals extend well beyond the permitted dumping zone in Beaufort's Dyke.
None of this was considered at the inquiry or at the parallel one held in
Northern Ireland. This is something that will now have to be seriously
considered.''

<HEADLINE>Princess shakes off paparazzi in Barbuda triangle</HEADLINE>

THE Princess of Wales was relaxing last night in the Caribbean but precisely
where was the unanswered question.
The princess, who will no doubt ponder her impending divorce while unwinding in
the sunshine, was thought to be staying at the K Club hotel on Barbuda, near
Antigua, in the West Indies.
However, staff at the #4000-a-week holiday complex said the princess was not a
guest.
They also insisted other known guests at the hotel were staying elsewhere,
perhaps at Coco Point, another hideaway club-hotel on the island, or at a
private villa.
It seemed, according to the K Club, the princess had disappeared in a ``Barbuda
triangle''.
A holidaymaker staying in one of the K Club's 28 cottages, the creation of
Italian fashion designer Krizia, can enjoy two miles of private, white sandy
beach under blue skies and temperatures rising to 90F.
The hotel, which takes a maximum of 89 guests, boasts that it aims ``to give
total bliss to just a few, a special few''.
There are two floodlit tennis courts, a nine-hole golf course, windsurfing,
snorkelling, water skiing, scuba diving, and fishing.
Cuisine is a mixture of French and Italian, with wines costing up to #230 a
bottle.
The princess ended her lonely Christmas at Kensington Palace to jet away to the
sun with personal assistant Victoria Mendham.
Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales, and sons Prince William, 13, and Prince Harry,
11, were at Sandringham, the Queen's Norfolk estate, where they have been
pheasant shooting.
They are due to leave for Klosters in the Swiss Alps on New Year's Day for a
skiing holiday.
As the princess flew via Antigua to Barbuda, new controversy erupted over her
husband's close friend Camilla Parker Bowles, with claims that she was now
determined to be Charles's wife and his official consort with the title Her
Royal Highness.
However the claims, reported in the Daily Express, were dismissed as ``fanciful
nonsense'' by sources close to the Prince of Wales.

<HEADLINE>Researcher accused of misleading patients</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A MEDICAL researcher was accused yesterday of misleading elderly patients by
playing down the risks involved in experimental operations.
Dr Srimathi Murali was alleged to have ignored a plea from one of his
colleagues to spell out more clearly the dangers involved in a project designed
to prevent hip fractures in elderly women.
The criticism was levelled at Dr Murali on the final day of a fatal accident
inquiry into the death of 70-year-old Mrs Phyllis Moffitt.
The inquiry at Aberdeen Sheriff Court was told Mrs Moffitt died while
undergoing an experimental operation at the city's Woodend Hospital in August
last year.
A post-mortem examination revealed she had died of a heart attack after being
given a sedative to ease discomfort during the operation.
Solicitor Reg Christie, representing the dead woman's family, claimed potential
volunteers were given inaccurate and misleading statistics about the associated
risks.
An information sheet stated volunteers would be given only a local anaesthetic,
that the work would be of great benefit, and that the operations would not be
painful.
However, Mr Christie said, Mrs Moffitt had to be given a sedative because of
the pain she was suffering.
In his summing-up, he told Sheriff Peter Hamilton: ``Insufficient care was
taken by those conducting this research to see that the statistical information
about the risk factor was accurate.
``There may have been a desire to increase or enhance the rate of take-up from
those who received the sheet.''
He said research assistant Fiona French had spoken to Dr Murali about the
``inaccuracy of the sheet''.
``She had become increasingly concerned because she was having to recruit the
people and explain, and she felt she was misrepresenting the people,'' he said.
Mr Christie claimed Dr Murali responded by telling her no amendment would be
made to the information sheets.
He added: ``Dr Murali must have been perfectly, consciously aware that these
people were suffering pain and discomfort and he refused to make an alteration.
``That amounts to Dr Murali engaging in a deliberate misrepresentation to
people he was asking to volunteer and help with his research project.''
Mr Christie said that if the dangers had been spelt out to Mrs Moffitt, who had
a known heart condition, she might not have taken part in the experiment.
Dr Murali's agent, Mr Robert Leith, said his client had tried to make sure Mrs
Moffitt knew all the risks involved before the operation began.
``I would submit that Dr Murali did his best to ensure that Mrs Moffitt had
read all she had signed for,'' he said.
``He sat down with her and asked her if she had any questions. By the time she
was in the hospital, she had no illusions about what was involved.
``The tragedy is that Mrs Moffitt suffered from a serious and significant
defect which was virtually undetectable, certainly by any reasonable means.''
Mr Leith told Sheriff Hamilton that hip fractures were a major and growing
problem which were costly to treat and caused suffering.
He asked the sheriff not to issue a judgment which would cause difficulties for
projects which necessarily involved the participation of elderly people.
The sheriff will issue his determination in due course.

THE Royal National Lifeboat Institution said yesterday that 1995 had been its
busiest year yet.
Provisional data compiled from its stations across the UK showed that boats had
been launched on more than 6000 occasions, compared to about 5400 in 1994. The
number of people saved from probable death fell slightly, to about 1400.
In Scotland, where the RNLI operates 42 lifeboat stations, the number of
launches remained virtually unchanged, at slightly more than 700. The number of
lives saved was 141,compared to 193.
An analysis of the UK total showed that incidents involving all types of
pleasure craft accounted for 56% of call-outs, while fishing vessels prompted
only 12% of all responses.
However, an RNLI spokeswoman declined to criticise pleasure sailors for any
irresponsibility.
She said: ``Incidents can happen for a variety of reasons: sometimes people may
be ill-prepared, equipment can malfunction, or the weather deteriorates.
``But we are not in the business of criticising people. We do not question why
our boats are called out, we just do it.''
The spokeswoman said, however, that the RNLI was putting continued effort into
its sea safety initiative, launched this year in conjunction with the
Coastguard Agency, the Marine Safety Agency, the Royal Yachting Association,
and other maritime groups.
More than one million booklets of safety guidelines have already been
distributed.

William Russell examines 70 years of service by the Royal Observer Corps, whose
finest hour came with the capture of Rudolf Hess
THEY are the nearest thing still around to Dad's Army, the gallant 233
volunteers left in the Royal Observer Corps, which comes to the end of the road
on Sunday.
Founded in 1925, the corps played a distinguished part in the Battle of
Britain, but its finest hour arguably belonged to a Scot, Major Graham Donald,
who was based at the Glasgow headquarters in New Temperance House, Pitt Street.
In 1941, during the night of May 10/11, a Messerschmitt 110 was plotted by the
corps' post on the Northumberland coast and tracked as it flew north towards
Scotland. The RAF rejected the corps' view that it was an ME110 and insisted it
was a Dornier. A former officer in the Royal Naval Air Service, Major Donald
stood his ground and when the plane crashed on Eaglesham Moors went to
investigate.
He found the police baffled by their prisoner, who had baled out just before
the plane hit the ground. The prisoner said his name was Horn and was demanding
to talk to the Duke of Hamilton. Donald tumbled to the fact that it was Rudolf
Hess, Hitler's deputy, but it took another 36 hours before the powers-that-be
were convinced, and Donald got little thanks for his efforts since he had shown
the intelligence services to be less than efficient.
The death sentence on the corps, given its nuclear warning role in 1955, was
passed four years ago by the then Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker. As part of a
review of Civil Defence needs following the end of the cold war, he decided the
cost of its role, by then the monitoring of nuclear fallout, could no longer be
justified. It was formally stood down on March 31, 1992.
But it was not the final curtain, because 233 volunteers at nuclear reporting
cells located at 15 key military command centres, three of which were in
Scotland, were kept on with the task of providing the national picture after an
attack by nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
When the cold war was at its height, the ROC, which had about 10,000 members,
had 275 monitoring posts in nuclear bunkers throughout Scotland alone. Across
Britain there were some 870. Those in Scotland were put up for sale. The two
top command centres, substantial underground structures in which Scottish
Office Ministers would have taken shelter, found other uses. One at Livingston
was turned into a rave nightclub, imaginatively called The Bunker, while the
one at Anstruther became a museum.
Borders region turned the considerable bunker below the High School in Peebles
into extra classrooms.
Formed in 1925, the corps was the result of experience during the First World
War when the aircraft-spotting system proved inadequate. It was decided in 1919
by the then Secretary of State for War and Air, Winston Churchill, that it was
essential to build on this experience. Six years and much talking later a
committee under Major General C F Romer drew up the scheme which led to the
establishment of the Observer Corps.
The members, recruited as special constables by the Home Office, were run by an
Army major general and supplied information to the RAF, a typically pragmatic
British solution. In 1929 the Air Ministry took over responsibility and
gradually the network was extended to cover the whole country.
By the time war broke out in 1939 the ROC system was in place. During the
Battle of Britain the corps played a vital role in spotting enemy aircraft, and
when the flying bombs started to fall in 1944 it proved more effective than
radar at spotting and tracking them. It acquired the ``royal'' prefix for its
war-time  contribution.
When the war ended the corps was disbanded, but peace in our time had not
arrived - the Russians were     a threat, and in 1947 it was   resurrected.
During the war there had been tension between the ROC and that other band of
volunteers, the Home Guard, and a splendid row - questions were asked in the
House and letters written to the Secretary of State for Scotland - erupted
between the Earl of Breadalbane and the Perthshire police sergeant in Killin
who was accused of poaching the Earl's ROC members for the local Home Guard.
On Sunday 70 years of distinguished voluntary service will finally end. The
corps' duties will pass to the RAF Regiment.
When the cold war was at its height, the ROC, which had about 10,000 members,
had 275 monitoring posts in nuclear bunkers throughout
Scotland

IT REACHED -24 in Helsinki yesterday, but the chances are you wouldn't have
found any power lines down, any trains delayed, any blue-skinned, gloveless
pedestrians stamping their ill-shod feet against the biting cold.
Where Britain is prone to collapsing under a welter of ``Big Freeze''
headlines, Scandinavia apparently takes sub-zero temperatures in its stride;
roads stay open, railways run on time, heads stay covered, and feet stay firmly
in warm boots.
``Of course, the Scandinavian countries experience this sort of climate every
year, therefore they are prepared to deal with it,'' says Alan Small, a
lecturer in geography and expert on Norway at Dundee University. ``They have
all the investment and equipment for clearing the roads and railways.
Meanwhile, we struggle with the occasional difficulty. We aren't really
prepared to cope with situations that occur once every 50 years or 100 years.''
In Norway and elsewhere, cold-weather contingencies include double or
triple-glazing as standard, robust and comprehensive heating systems,
compulsory winter tyres, powerful snow blowers, permanent car headlights and
appropriate clothing.
``They use the snow blowers on the railways as well,'' says Alan Small. ``And
the railways stay open. Maybe one or two roads are just allowed to close, some
of the mountain links they just write off for several months of the year.
``Also, people dress for the weather. That's one contrast with here which is
very marked. Here people don't seem to look at the temperature before they go
outside. Almost every Norwegian, however, has a thermometer and he looks at it
every day and sees that it's going to be -10 or -20, and he will have the
right kind of clothing on.''
Unlike many parts of Britain, remote areas of Norway are not always the first
to suffer when a cold snap sets in. Alan Small says they know they are liable
to be cut off for a spell in winter and will have stockpiled adequate supplies.
``The rural areas also have a very strong voice in parliament and they do much
better. For example, many of the mountain roads have been replaced with tunnels
which are much easier to keep open in the winter.''
Dr Thomas Munck, a Dane who teaches modern history at Glasgow University,
acknowledges that the Scandinavians are used to the Arctic conditions which
have caught us on the hop, but thinks the problem may go deeper.
``I suppose part of it is the usual question of investment in infrastructure.
The power supply system in Scotland is 40 to 50 years old and there has been a
lack of investment in infrastructure, at least until a few years ago. I'm not
suggesting that the Scandinavian countries are models of their kind but they
probably have a better infrastructure support because the assumption is that
the state provides a public transport system which is fully integrated and
regulated.
``In Denmark the trains don't freeze to the tracks; they don't get the wrong
kind of snow. Danish winters are much more severe on a regular basis and you
will not see what you are seeing now in Glasgow - roads that have not been
snow-ploughed as a matter of course. They have equipment ready and are
expecting that kind of weather.
``It's absurd that railway carriages should be frozen to the tracks. In
Copenhagen the commuter lines run at 10-minute intervals, and right through
winter. I can set my watch by the trains. You can predict to within one minute
when you will get to your station because everything always operates like
clockwork.''
A spokesman for the Automobile Association, meanwhile, insisted that it would
be wrong to look to Scandinavia for all the answers.
``We often think that on the continent, in Scandinavia, it is so much better,
but that's not necessarily true. Unless you have snow chains you can't get
about. The effect of snow and ice is that no matter how good a system you have,
if you have huge ice crystals hanging off your tram lines they're not going to
be able to run.
``We have found that when you look at the Alpine regions of Europe in terms of
snow fall when they have a blizzard there is chaos for the first 24 hours just
as there is here and it takes a while to adjust.''
However, those with experience of both cultures and climates say there is no
doubt that the Scandinavians do it better.
``They are just so much more geared up for it,'' said one Scottish businessman
who travels frequently in Finland, Sweden and Norway. ``They dress for it, they
drive for it, they build their homes for it, they plan for it. But above all
else they enjoy it. They go in for saunas in a big way, they have cross-country
skiing. They like getting out into it. They don't just sit indoors and complain
about it like we do.''

MOTORING experts are spending #145,000 to solve one of the world's longest
standing arguments - are women or men the better drivers.
The Automobile Association has commissioned a three-year study by psychologists
at Reading University into the behaviour patterns of male and female motorists.
While more women take to the road as teenagers and company car drivers, the
motoring group wants to find out if the driving habits of the population are
changing.
According to the latest figures, men have more accidents per licence held,
while women have more crashes per mile driven.
The study is being funded by the AA's Foundation for Road Safety Research in
the hope of developing specific training schemes for men and women drivers.
Foundation manager Brian Langer said: ``The number of women holding driving
licences has doubled to more than 12 million, while their age profile has
changed dramatically.
``It used to be that women learned to drive after their family had grown up and
they were looking for a job.
``Nowadays, young teenage girls are just as keen to get behind the wheel as
boys.''
Mr Langer said statistics proved that the most accident-prone road users were
young men, but he said that, as more teenage girls began to drive and found
themselves involved in accidents, that figure was changing.
``There is anecdotal evidence that teenage girls are taking on the driving
characteristics of young men.
``They are more aggressive and reckless behind the wheel than other groups of
women drivers. We want to find out if this is true.''
Psychologists at Reading University will take to the road with men and women of
different ages to assess their driving habits.
They will look at how they respond to road hazards, which routes they favour,
what bad habits they have, how they overtake, and the speed at which they drive.
Professor Frank McKenna, of the university's psychology department, said: ``The
study will look not only at the differences in driving style between men and
women but also the influences that affect driver behaviour.''
Mr Kenneth Faircloth, chairman of the AA foundation, said: ``This research will
focus on the key differences between men and women drivers and will help
develop specific training programmes.''
q INCREASING numbers of ``road rage'' incidents and assaults have created fear
among women drivers in Scotland, according to the results of a survey released
yesterday.
The results showed that two-thirds of women lock their doors when driving due
to fear of attacks.
One woman in 10 is afraid of parking in the street, while three in five are
scared to park in multi-storeys. It also showed that one in five supports
women-only parking spaces.
The survey was carried out by Norwich Union as part of its annual Safe Car Park
Award Scheme, which highlights women's safety issues.

EL PASO: A man has died in hospital after being shot in the head on Christmas
Day while driving on a Texas highway, allegedly by a 13-year-old boy in search
of more toys.
Ricardo Soto, of Fort Hancock, was charged as a juvenile with deadly conduct in
the death of 41-year-old Alberto Tarango.
The suspect's nine-year-old brother told investigators that his big brother
wanted to shoot out the tyres of a tractor-trailer he thought was carrying
video games. Instead the shot hit Tarango's nearby pick-up truck.
However a newspaper later reported that the younger boy disclaimed this.-AP.

SIX thousand skiers and snow-boarders enjoyed superb conditions on Scotland's
slopes yesterday.......the busiest day of the festive break so far.
Temperatures at the five Scots winter sports centres remained well below zero
all day, while clear blue skies, with hardly any winds, were the order of the
day.
Road access was clear to all centres. However, some resorts still do not have
as much snow as they would like and the White Corries Centre in Glencoe has yet
to open for the season.
The excellent skiing conditions will continue today and operators of all
resorts are keeping their fingers crossed that the settled but bitterly cold
spell of weather will continue beyond Hogmanay.
Not so the homeless and those working to keep them off the streets during
Scotland's big chill.
Shelter in Scotland director Ms Liz Nicholson said homeless people in the
larger cities had a wide range of hostels to choose from but those in smaller
towns were less fortunate.
In Glasgow, emergency accommodation is being provided through the city
council's Winter Watch Campaign between December and March. Under the scheme,
now in its third year, a number of places in hostels across the city are kept
for those who need accommodation in an emergency.
The campaign is run through the Hamish Allan Centre, a hostel in Centre Street,
which links to other hostels in the city to provide beds.
The centre itself has 24 emergency places available.
Operations director Brian O'Hara said: ``We have had 62 presentations since the
beginning of the campaign and we have been able to accommodate them all.''
He said Glasgow did not need an emergency shelter for when the weather turned
bad: ``We do not have a homelessness problem on the scale of that in London.''
Ms Margaret Stevenson, director of the Talbot Association, a hostel also
involved in the campaign, agreed. ``Glasgow is unique as it has an adequate
number of places,'' Ms Stevenson said. ``There tends to be a place for everyone
who needs and wants it. There are small groups of people that just won't come
in and we take food and blankets to them.''
Major Raymond Ward, team leader for the Glasgow Homeless for the Salvation
Army, said: ``At this time of year, we get people who would normally sleep
rough. There aren't actually a big proportion of these in Glasgow.''
However, he does believe a large emergency accommodation centre would help.
Meanwhile, it became clear yesterday that the major problems in the storm-hit
parts of northern Scotland have arisen in areas where the original power-lines,
dating back 40 years, are still in use.
Hydro-Electric are spending #20m a year on replacing old lines. About 1000
miles of overhead lines will be replaced each year out of a total of 30,000
miles of cables carried by electric poles in the whole of northern Scotland.
In the Western Isles alone the privatised company has spent #41m on line
renewals during the past five years. A Hydro-Electric spokesman said: ``We are
seeing a clear link between the age of the lines and problems with cuts in
power supply during the present emergency.''
He said almost all the areas which suffered serious power supply problems were
still served by the network erected when the Highlands and Islands were
electrified in the late 1940s and 1950s.
Earlier this year, the company was the only privatised electricity utility in
Britain to refuse an order from the Government's Electricity Regulator to cut
power costs by 10% over a three-year period.
Hydro-Electric's chairman Lord Wilson of Tillyorn argued then that his company
was a special case because of the very long mileage of rural supply lines which
needed to be replaced.
He won his case in an appeal to the Government's Monopolies and Merger
Commission.

BENEFIT fraud investigators in Scotland were praised yesterday for saving the
taxpayer more than #46m this year.
Social Security Fraud Minister Oliver Heald said almost #500m had been saved
across the UK this financial year, ahead of targets laid down by the Department
of Social Security.
In Scotland, the savings figures were: Glasgow and Paisley, #17m; north,
central, and west Scotland, #15m; and east Scotland, #14m.
Mr Heald said: ``I congratulate our investigators but there is more to be done
if we are to put an end to this fraud and I would ask them to redouble their
efforts in 1996.''
A Benefits Agency spokeswoman said social security fraud covered a wide range
of offences, from individuals misrepresenting facts about themselves, to
organised criminal groups involved in large-scale fraud.
The main areas affected are income support, housing benefit, unemployment
benefit, and incapacity benefit.
A number of innovative methods for detecting fraud have recently been
introduced by the agency, including the world's largest data matching system,
which allows computerised cross-checks to spot anomalies in claims.

THE introduction of Republic of Ireland-style tax breaks and the establishment
of a single organisation to oversee policy and strategy were among proposals
put forward yesterday by the SNP to boost Scotland's post-Braveheart film
industry.
The plans, which will be contained in a consultation document to be published
in the new year, have been formulated after discussions with the country's
major film organisations and leading industry figures.
Ms Roseanna Cunningham, the SNP's parliamentary spokesperson on film, said:
``Future success depends on a sustainable level of domestic production that
will result in regular success for low and medium-budget films and the
attraction of international films to be shot in Scotland. Our consultations
have led us to propose two essential first steps.
``The first is the introduction by Government of tax breaks for production,
which must be modelled on the highly successful `Section 35' Irish scheme.''
Film investment from private sources, which Ms Cunningham also regarded as
vital, would not be forthcoming to any significant degree unless these tax
breaks were in place.
In the Republic, as a means of encouraging new work, a film company is allowed
to write off tax for new investment. To qualify, it has to prove that the
project is worthwhile, that a proportion of the budget will be spent on
training, and that the film will employ an Irish crew.
The policy has met with startling success. At present, there are 80 movie
projects in development in Ireland. In Scotland, there are 20. The tax breaks
were in part responsible for Mel Gibson's decision to move filming from
Scotland to Ireland for the huge battle scenes in Braveheart.
Though the eventual tax advantages did little more than cover the costs of
moving location, Gibson admitted that the Irish had been enormously helpful,
providing thousands of extras from the ranks of the Irish army and around 600
horses. It is this climate of assistance, as much as the tax breaks, which the
SNP wants to create in Scotland.
To this end, the Nationalists' chief executive, Mr Mike Russell, disclosed that
the second essential step would be the establishment of Scottish Screen, a
federated organisation which would bring together existing bodies such as the
Scottish Film Council, the Scottish Film Production Fund, Scottish Screen
Locations, and the Scottish Broadcasting and Film Training Trust. It would be a
``one-stop shop'' for film-makers.
It would also include a new department, responsible for marketing and
distributing Scottish films at home and - more importantly - abroad.
Further down the line, the party also proposed the establishment of a Scottish
Film School and the creation of a major sound stage for film and television
production.

<HEADLINE>Maximum fine levied for `a catalogue of neglect' Solicitor to pay #10,000 penalty</HEADLINE>

A LAWYER has been fined the maximum #10,000 by the Scottish Solicitors
Discipline Tribunal for professional misconduct.
The fine on 55-year-old Stranraer solicitor Andrew Murray for ``a catalogue of
neglect and delay'' follows an #8000 penalty imposed on him by the tribunal in
February 1994 for similar failures.
This time the tribunal, which gave serious consideration to striking Mr Murray
off the roll of practising solicitors, has also ruled that, for the next 10
years, he will be limited to practising as a qualified assistant.
In a written judgment, the the tribunal stated that Mr Murray had been a
solicitor since 1966 and practised on his own under the name of Hunter and
Murray at Lewis Street, Stranraer, and Victoria Street, Newton Stewart.
It found him guilty of ``unconscionable delay'' in carrying through the
administration of four estates, failure to respond to reasonable inquiries by
the Bank of Scotland in connection with a trust, failure to respond to
inquiries by the Law Society, and misleading the society by informing it that
an inventory had been signed when it had not.
Mr Murray failed over a period of more than three and a half years to respond
to reasonable inquiries by the Bank of Scotland.
He was also found guilty of failure to comply with the solicitors' accounts
rules.
In January 1989, he paid #12,500 to a former client in compensation for
mistakes in a conveyancing transaction and withdrew a cheque for that amount
from a trust fund.
This created a shortage on his client account, in breach of the accounts rules.
The tribunal found that in acquiring a hotel on behalf of a client, Mr Murray
had overlooked the fact that the title to part of the property was on a 99-year
lease. Subsequently, #12,500 had to be paid to acquire a feudal title.
Mr Murray had accepted responsibility for the error and the compensation of
#12,500 represented his personal liability.
However, Mr Murray ``regrettably'' withdrew that amount on a cheque from a
trust he was administering.
In due course, he received a cheque for #10,500 from the solicitors'
professional indemnity insurance policy and credited it to the trust.
Nevertheless, the outstanding balance of #2000 created a succession of
shortages in his client account.
In the case of three other estates, the tribunal decided that unconscionable
delay on Mr Murray's part had not been established, nor had it been established
that interim fees charged on two of them were excessive.
Summing up the case, the tribunal stated: ``Mr Murray had previously been
before this tribunal on February 16, 1994, in relation to a number of similar
matters, and on that occasion he was censured and fined #8000.
``The present findings of this tribunal demonstrate a further catalogue of
neglect and delay.
``Additionally, the tribunal takes a most serious view of Mr Murray's actings
in withdrawing monies from an ongoing trust to meet a personal liability.
``It is clear from the circumstances of this complaint that he cannot be
permitted to continue in practice and, indeed, serious consideration was given
to suspending him or striking his name from the roll.
``However, having regard to his lengthy period of service to the profession,
the tribunal marginally draws short of making such an order.
``Nevertheless, it is appropriate that the tribunal should stigmatise Mr
Murray's overall conduct in a significant manner and it is with these
considerations that the maximum fine has been imposed.
``As it is not appropriate that Mr Murray should continue in practice as a
principal, a restriction has been placed on his practising certificate for a
period of 10 years.''
The tribunal also ordered that publicity should be given to its decision.

A PLAN to build a #3m stadium for Clydebank Football Club has received another
setback.
Clydebank District Council's planning committee has decided to continue the bid
to sell Kilbowie to English company Vico, a property developer - which means
another month's delay.
Planning convener Jim Doherty said: ``We have decided to seek a valuation of
the site involved because of a difference of opinion in the value.''
The council, which owns part of the site involved, may not sell public land
below the valuation.
The club needs the money from the sale of Kilbowie to push ahead with
developing the 8000-seat stadium on a 15-acre site just off Great Western
Boulevard, near Drumchapel.
The planning application submitted by Vico involves the construction of four
retail outlets.
It is likely that the stadium will be named after former Clydebank star Davie
Cooper, who died after a brain haemorrhage.

PRIVATE sector tenants in the south and west of Glasgow have won a battle to
stop their landlord imposing a #1450 rent increase.
The Western Heritable Investment Company failed to convince the Rent Assessment
Committee that the rents of 539 properties in Kings Park, Croftfoot,
Hillington, Cardonald, and Kelvindale should be increased from the #2150
suggested by the Rent Officer to #3600.
The tenants were represented by Aitkenhead councillor Louise Fyfe, who said
last night: ``These properties are occupied mostly by elderly tenants and tend
to be in a poor state of repair. Many of the tenants have great difficulty
getting their landlord to carry out repairs efficiently, yet there is a move
for this massive increase.''
It is the tenants' second victory against Western Heritable. A 1992 decision by
the Rent Assessment Committee to restrict rents for the same properties to
#1860 was upheld in the Court of Session last June.
At a recent hearing concerning the latest rents proposals, Western Heritable
claimed tenants had no grounds for complaint about repairs.
The company argued that similar properties were being rented for #3600 on the
open market. It also argued that it was not part of the company's function to
look after elderly tenants.
However, tenants' evidence suggested that many of the properties were in a poor
state of repair and that many tenants suffered from water penetration, poor
sound insulation, unsafe wiring, crumbling steps and pathways, and leaking
doors, windows, gutters, and roofs.
The committee visited a sample of the houses and expressed ``concern'' about
the condition of some of the properties.
Councillor Fyfe said the #3600 rents proposed by Western Heritable were kept
artificially high by the Housing Benefit system and by the shortage of rented
housing in the area.
She said similar properties in the area, including Housing Association
properties, had rents set at #2150.
Mr Tom Rowlands, manager of Western Heritable's Glasgow Office, said: ``We are
disappointed. We feel we presented enough evidence to show that a market rent
was #3600.
``However, it was not sufficient to convince the committee that it was the way
to go about making their decision on rents. They decided they would prefer to
use comparable rents, which other rent officers had already set.''
A company decision on the possibility of an appeal to the Court of Session will
not be made until the board of directors has considered the decision in detail.

TEXAS returns to its Wild West roots on Monday when a law goes into effect
allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons for the first time in 125 years.
Opponents fear the law will unleash more violence on the streets. Proponents
say it will enable law-abiding Texans to defend themselves in an increasingly
dangerous society.
``All I want to do is put innocent people, those who are potential victims, in
a position of being able to protect themselves,'' said Democratic state
Representative Ron Wilson, who represents an inner-city Houston neighbourhood
and was one of the sponsors of the new law.
Sherri Deatherage-Green, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety,
said 171,000 people had requested permit applications and 35,000 had applied.
Only 1200 had been approved so far, but that number will grow in coming weeks.
The law requires citizens to take a 15-hour gun-handling course and pass
background checks to show if they have a criminal past or a history of mental
illness. Instructors, who began offering the course in September, said most
customers were elderly people concerned about personal safety.
Florida has had a similar state law since 1987. According to Alan Thompson, a
police officer and doctoral student in the criminal justice department at Sam
Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas, only about 1.5% of Florida's 14
million residents have obtained a permit and the effects, either positive or
negative, have been hard to measure.
``The numbers are so small it's difficult to interpret what's happened there,''
he said.
A survey of Texas police officers found that most do not welcome the new law
because of concerns about their own safety and a feeling that it will put more
guns on the streets with little or no deterrent effect on crime.
In 1871, the Texas Legislature, tired of Wild West gunslingers' violence,
outlawed the carrying of concealed weapons. However it overturned the ban last
spring with a Bill quickly signed into law by the state governor then,
Republican George Bush.
The law has been diluted by a rash of local government decisions forbidding
guns in everything from public parks to city buses. The state Department of
Public Safety, in charge of administering the law, will forbid guns in its own
buildings and has ordered its officers to ask all drivers pulled over for
traffic violations if they have a permit and are carrying arms.
As January 1 approaches, many Texans are wondering how the gun law will affect
their everyday lives.
``Do you still shoot someone the finger if you're in your car and they cut in
front of you? My daughter has warned me to keep my hands on the steering
wheel,'' said a Houston editor who frequently admonishes bad drivers with an
obscene gesture.
Thompson cautioned gun holders not to get too carried away with their new-found
power. ``It's like a new police officer who gets a gun and suddenly feels 10ft
tall and bulletproof - what is commonly referred to as the `John Wayne
syndrome'.''
Thompson advised: ``Be reasonable and understand that no situation is without
alternatives . . . familiarise yourself with the limits of deadly
force.''-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>US buy-out rumours over Devonport Final Trident secret may go in sell-off</HEADLINE>

THE Government could be handing its last major military secret to the United
States on a platter if the #5000m Trident submarine refit deal goes ahead at
Devonport.
Despite an exchange of strategic intelligence unparalleled between any of the
other Western nations, Britain has always kept details of its
Rolls-Royce-designed power plant for nuclear submarines from even its closest
ally.
No US naval officer is allowed near the reactor compartment on any of the Royal
Navy's current 16 strategic or hunter-killer boats and the specifications for
the compact and efficient PWR2 nuclear steam-raising plant developed by RR's
Industrial Power Group remain classified.
However, the current Devonport Management Ltd, the consortium operating the
Plymouth yard on behalf of the Defence Ministry, includes the British
subsidiary of Brown and Root, part of the American Halliburton International
Corporation.
There are now unconfirmed rumours that Brown and Root may be about to bid for
outright ownership of the yard under Government plans to privatise both
Devonport and its Scottish rival at Rosyth.
The first Trident submarine, the 16,000-ton HMS Vanguard, is due for refit and
replacement of its nuclear fuel rods in the year 2000.
If a US-owned company takes charge of the operation, it would be naive to think
that the Pentagon and its Defence Intelligence Agency offshoot would hesitate
to take advantage of technology which British sources say is more advanced than
the reactors fitted to the US Navy's 14-strong fleet of Ohio-class Trident
boats.
As reported exclusively in The Herald last April, Devonport is currently unable
to obtain a safety licence from the independent Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate because of the potentially unstable nature of the limestone base
on which it is built.
Reinforcing former battleship docks at the site to meet the strict safety
regulations could cost anything between #500m and #700m and would make
Devonport's winning bid for the lucrative Trident work a commercial nonsense
and a political embarrassment for the Government.
There is also the question of the safety aspects of the yard's application for
an expansion of the nuclear refitting docks to within yards of a
densely-populated area of Plymouth.
The Government was understood to have been ready to make a compromise
announcement on the issue just before Parliament rose last week. The options
available included having the missile submarines refuelled at Rosyth and
refitted at Devonport, or a complete U-turn to reassess the financial aspects
of the contract and its re-assignment to the Fife yard.
There is a widely-held belief that the original bids were assessed more on the
fact that the Conservatives have four marginal Parliamentary seats in the West
Country than on commercial viability.
It is also understood that consideration was given to approaching the US Navy's
Trident boat refitting yard at Puget Sound in Washington State to carry out the
work to avoid having to make a politically-damaging choice in the UK. This
option was discarded in the face of naval objections.
The Cabinet is now hoping that it can delay a decision until the issue of
outright sale of the sites can be addressed in the New Year, despite pressure
from both management teams and unions representing workforces concerned about
their long-term future.
A Defence Ministry spokeswoman said last night: ``There are no new moves on the
refit plans. As far as the design and security of the Royal Navy's reactors is
concerned, it is MoD policy not to discuss nuclear issues in detail.''
An industry source said: ``The Americans gave the UK its first submarine
reactor, designed by Westinghouse, back in the 1960s. It was a gift aimed at
bringing the Royal Navy into the Cold War to tip the scales against a very
powerful Soviet fleet at that time. It went into HMS Dreadnought.
``Since then, there has been almost no reactor co-operation technologically.
The US has gone its own way and the UK has pursued a policy of improvement in
efficiency and reduction in size. The Rolls-Royce design is perhaps the UK's
last great secret.
``The Americans have opted for long-life cores in their reactors, which are
larger, which means longer intervals between replacement of fuel rods. They do
bring their subs back in for maintenance, however, at King's Bay in Georgia and
Brenerton in Washington State at regular intervals.
``This involves general maintenance and upgrading of sensor and weapons
systems. It has nothing to do with the reactor, which can be handled only at
Puget Sound.''
Rosyth, which has handled the bulk of the UK's nuclear refits over the last 25
years, was supposed to cease nuclear work in 1997. Because of Devonport's
upgrading and safety problems, this has now been extended.

A CONSULTANT involved with the care of elderly patients has been suspended by
his NHS trust employers.
Dr Kenneth McAlpine is believed to have been involved in disagreements with
colleagues. Now he has been told not to come to work pending an inquiry by
Renfrewshire Healthcare Trust.
Although he works mainly at Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley, Dr McAlpine is
employed by the Healthcare Trust, which provides long-stay elderly and
psychiatric services in the area.
At his home in Kilmacolm yesterday, Dr McAlpine refused to confirm or deny his
suspension.
``I have no comment to make. I have no wish to see anything published,'' he
said.
A hospital colleague said Dr McAlpine had been at odds in the past with other
geriatricians.
The chairman of the trust, Dr John Moffat, said: ``There is a matter of concern
which we are looking into and, as is common practice in the NHS, he has been
told: `Please stay at home meantime.' The suspension is not a disciplinary
matter.
``As the person who has to receive whatever report emerges from this, I cannot
say too much but I gather this is not over something that patients or relatives
need be alarmed about. It is more to do with internal affairs than with
anything directly affecting patients.''
Dr McAlpine is a graduate of St Andrews University and previously worked in
geriatric medicine at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Lightburn Hospital.
He was involved in controversy earlier this year as joint author of a review
which led to sweeping changes at East Park Home and School for infirm children
in Glasgow.
The changes included the dismissal of the matron, Mrs Eleanor McCreadie, and -
in effect - her replacement with administrator Mrs May Henderson, a divorcee
who was involved in a relationship with Dr McAlpine.

EIGHT years after Alistair MacLean's death, three new short stories and a
missing screenplay have been discovered in his mansion by Lake Geneva.
Villa Murat is still the home of the writer's first wife - they divorced in
1972 - and the manuscripts are thought to have been lying in the corner of the
house's damp cellar since then.
Mr David Bishop, the author's friend and executor, knew of the screenplay, The
Swashbuckler, when he began the search together with Mr Alistair MacLean Jr.
The three stories were a complete surprise. Two of them, The Black Storm and
The Good Samaritan, will appear in this paper tomorrow.
It is fitting that they should: it was winning The Herald's 1954 short-story
competition that launched a 37-year career that earned MacLean #20m.
The excitement of his prize and his propulsion to best-selling author - his
first book, HMS Ulysses, sold 250,000 hardback copies in its first six months -
meant the stories were forgotten. They were written while MacLean was still a
school teacher.
The screenplay, a pirate adventure, was written in 1968 and a copy had once
been owned by Elliot Kastner, the hell-raising Hollywood producer who had an
enormous influence on MacLean's writing. It was Kastner who convinced MacLean
to write the screenplay of a story before the novel, a technique that critics
felt harmed the quality of the books.
The screenplay is currently being examined by American producers to see if it
could stand alongside the other films written by MacLean.

BEN Lomond and the Rowardennan Estate on its flanks is to become a national
park dedicated to the memory of those who served the country in the Second
World War, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth announced yesterday.
In his New Year message to Scotland, Mr Forsyth said the park will be based on
conservation principles ``giving priority to landscape, nature conservation,
and quiet recreation''.
Plans for the area, which belongs to Forest Enterprise and the National Trust
for Scotland, will include a project for increasing the area of native woodland.
The second major plank in his New Year message was that leaders of the other
major political parties in Scotland are to join him in a Scotland Against Drugs
campaign.
Both initiatives, however, attracted immediate criticism.
Mr George Robertson, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, turned on Mr Forsyth
for hijacking the plan for the drugs campaign. It was clear last night that Mr
Robertson had expected a joint announcement with the other political leaders.
Of the Ben Lomond Memorial Park plan, Mr Robertson said: ``How much more
imaginative it would have been to declare the whole of Loch Lomond and the
Trossachs as Scotland's first national park.''

THE cold weather has claimed another four lives with the deaths of a homeless
man in Scotland and two men and an 11-year-old girl in a lake in West Yorkshire.
The lake victims died after they were trapped under ice for two hours in a
water park in Hamsworth, Kinsley, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire.
The accident happened after Tracy Patterson, 11, of Wortley Place, Hemsworth,
tried to rescue a dog. She got into difficulties and fell into the water. A
passer-by, Jack Crawshaw, of Wrenthorpe, near Wakefield, jumped into the water
but he was soon in difficulties himself.
Mr Mike Mee, 48, a fire officer who was walking in the park with his wife,
attempted to rescue the pair by spreading a tarpaulin sheet over the ice. But
the ice gave way and he too disappeared under the water.
Emergency fire services were on the scene in minutes but had to abandon their
rescue attempt and call in a police underwater search unit. The three were
found at a depth of three metres and had drifted seven metres from the bank of
the lake.
All three were taken to Pontefract General Infirmary and placed on ventilator
machines even though none had any heartbeat or pulse. Doctors attempted to
raise their body temperatures by using cardiac massage and injecting warm
fluids into their bodies. After five hours, however, the battle was called off
and they were pronounced dead.
In Bathgate, a 54-year-old man sleeping rough died as he huddled for shelter
against the winter blasts in a vennel. Mr John Murphy became the first homeless
person in Scotland to die in the severe winter. His death prompted calls for
more action to ease the plight of the homeless.
Mr Murphy's body was found in an alleyway between two houses in the West
Lothian town's Marina Road early on Wednesday morning as temperatures plummeted
to -15C. Police said he was found wearing a light jacket and trousers and had
no blankets covering his body.
It also emerged that the freezing temperatures claimed an elderly victim in
Renfrewshire on Tuesday night. Widow Elizabeth Donaldson, 77, was discovered
frozen to death in an industrial estate in Linwood by a teenage girl.
Police said the pensioner had decided to go out for a walk, possibly became
disorientated and had succumbed to hypothermia. She was found dead behind a
baker's store in the Mossedge goods yard. The pensioner, of Watson Avenue,
Linwood, lived alone but had been reported missing by a neighbour.
Mr Murphy's death prompted a call from Shelter, the homeless action group, for
more accommodation for those sleeping rough on Scotland's streets as weather
conditions looked set to worsen.
The organisation said it would be contacting Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
today in the wake of the death. It is estimated that between 500 and 1000
people have been sleeping on Scotland's streets over the Christmas period.
The organisation's Kate Caskie said: ``We believe that Mr Murphy's death
highlights the problems they face over Christmas and I will be contacting the
Scottish Office today to try and find a way of setting up temporary
accommodation centres for the homeless people during the cold weather.
``I accept that needs new cash but surely the Scottish Office with its
resources could find places to help the people on the street at least in the
short term.''
The Scottish Office later confirmed it was pressing ahead with a study into the
homelessness problem. When asked about Shelter's calls for temporary
accommodation for the homeless, a spokeswoman said: ``We regret the death of Mr
Murphy but it is up to the housing authorities to pinpoint their local needs
regarding homelessness.''
Ms Caskie described the Scottish Office response as ``a cop-out''.
She added: ``The Government has spent thousands of pounds through the years
finding places for homeless people in London. So far in Scotland they haven't
spent a penny which is appalling.''
Ms Donaldson's death brought a warning from Age Concern Scotland that many
pensioners would suffer severe health problems because of the drop in
temperature.
However, a spokeswoman for Strathclyde Regional Council's social work
department said the region's 75,000 elderly people appeared to have been coping
remarkably well with the cold weather but said there were concerns if the cold
spell continued.
Police forces said there had been a number of sudden deaths over the last few
days but only Lothian and Borders said that the deaths of seven people over a
24-hour period could be linked to the cold weather.
Officers were called to investigate the deaths of a 69-year-old woman in
Bathgate; a 21-year-old man in Dunbar; a 69-year old woman in Penicuik, a
91-year-old in Livingston; and a 78-year-old in Blackburn.
Two 54-year-olds also died at different addresses in Edinburgh. All the victims
died in their homes and there were no suspicious circumstances.
Assistant chief constable Tom Wood said: ``The deaths have obviously been due
to a number of factors but the cold is exacerbating it.''
Across Scotland emergency services reported a spate of frozen and burst pipes.
Strathkelvin District Council's housing department opened three emergency
centres for residents in Kirkintilloch to provide running water.
Mr Fraser Millar, who fell through ice at Threipmuir Reservoir, Balerno, on
Christmas Eve, was last night in a ``serious but stable'' condition in the
Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh.
Mr Millar, 29, of Bughtlin Park, Corstorphine, Edinburgh, had been trapped for
an hour in the reservoir after ice gave way beneath him as he tried to rescue
his dog.

EXCLUSIVE
THE family of 16-year-old John Colquhoun, who froze to death on Christmas Day,
revealed last night it was the second tragedy to strike them in as many years.
The dead youth's sister, Lorna, was left grieving the death of her boyfriend
early last year.
Like John, unemployed builder Martin Coia, 18, of Auchinleck, died from
hypothermia after trying to walk home early in the morning.
He walked out of the Colquhoun family home in Barbieston Avenue, Drongan, at
1am after a row with Miss Colquhoun. The couple had been together for 18
months.
He decided to cut across fields and failed to return home. He was found four
days later.
John Colquhoun, who also died after trying to walk home, was a passenger in a
car that slid off the road at 3am. He and the driver, Mr Ronald Paterson, 21,
walked off in different directions and John's frozen body was found the next
day under a bridge two miles from the scene of the accident.
Last night, Miss Colquhoun, 18, said: ``What happened to John has brought it
all back. I can't believe this has happened. We are all devastated.''
Miss Colquhoun explained why Mr Coia tried to walk home in bitterly cold
weather. She said: ``He had left my house early in the morning after we had
fallen
out. He had been drinking and he just decided to walk home to Auchinleck.
``He must have fallen asleep after stopping for a rest.''
Mr John Colquhoun Sr, 41, said: ``My advice to anybody in the same position
would be to stay off the back roads in weather like this and stick together if
anything happens. Don't be afraid to ask for help.''
He added that Mr Paterson, who was driving at the time of the accident, should
not feel guilty about what had happened.
He said: ``Although Ronald is a few years older than John, they hung around
together all the time. He was here last night and he was in an awful state.
He's
not letting himself come to terms with it and he's blaming himself, but he
shouldn't. We understand what happened and it could easily have been the other
way round.''

<HEADLINE>Border Grain enjoys record throughput</HEADLINE>

BORDER Grain Limited, the Berwickshire-based farmers' co-operative, had a
record throughput of just under 31,000 tonnes this year.
``We have had an extremely good year and are now examining a number of measures
which will enable us to build on our success next year and beyond,'' said
chairman Gareth Baird.
``While it is immensely satisfying to be able to base our operation on more
than 30,000 tonnes of grain for the first time in our 16-year history, we want
to convert as much as possible of the uncommitted tonnage which we attracted
this year into pre-harvest commitments next year.
The 17-strong co-operative group is also keen to add to its membership,
believing that its record over the past two years would stand comparison with
any similar grain-sector business.
``We are definitely performing at a high level and producing consistently good
results for our members,'' said Mr Baird. ``The combination of good yields and
good returns this year has given all cereal growers in Scotland fresh
opportunities to improve their long-term prospects.
``In keeping with others in the grain sector, therefore, we are determined to
use some of our 1995 gains to achieve greater trading strength in the future.''
As part of its development plan the co-op has decided to retain all of the
1994-95 profit of #28,500 in the business to cover the cost of the on-going
refurbishment and upgrading of Border Grain's drying, storage and distribution
base at Charterhall, Duns.
``When you consider that we haven't increased drying charges since July 1990,
our #28,500 profit is an indication of our current strength,'' said Mr Baird.
The Charterhall complex can dry up to 60 tonnes an hour and has a total storage
capacity of 30,000 tonnes. It also has a ``futures-approved'' store which
allows grain to be traded on the futures market without the imposition of
additional haulage charges.
The co-operative has a strong malting-barley base but also trades soft wheat,
milling wheat, milling oats, oilseed rape, high erusic acid rapeseed, protein
peas and beans, and linseed.
In addition to handling both committed and uncommitted grain from members,
Border Grain takes grain from non-members and provides contract drying and
storage services.

THE first medic on the scene was 22-year-old George McIlwraith, a volunteer
with St Andrew's Ambulance Corps.
The opening 15 minutes of the match were even more run-of-the-mill than usual.
He treated one man with a nose-bleed and another for a knee injury.
Bizarrely, both were to re-emerge from the terraces later - with one in
particular playing a crucial role in Mr McIlwraith's sudden appearance on
Stairway 13 just as the tragedy unfolded.
Close to the end of the game, the man with the nose-bleed returned for more
treatment. Then the man with the sore knee fell in an area close to where
dozens would topple to their deaths moments later.
Mr McIlwraith went into the crowd and patched up the man before taking him on a
stretcher to the trackside.
While there, Mr McIlwraith was ordered by another first aid officer to go to
the back of the stadium because of rumours that ``a gate had collapsed''.
Mr McIlwraith was adamant he subsequently asked a policeman on the terraces
where the gate had collapsed but was told only that he had no knowledge of it.
Speaking at length about his experiences for the first time - and also
expressing surprise that he was never called to the fatal accident inquiry - Mr
McIlwraith, now 47, and duty officer for first aiders at Hampden Park, recalled:
``I had gone up Stairway 14, spoke to the policeman, then went to Stairway 13.
I did not see, as everyone described in the press, a heap of bodies on the
stairs . . .
``But I did see a grass embankment covered in bodies and a lot of people lying
at the bottom of the embankment.
``A lot of people were injured, a lot were unconscious. Because there were so
many, I could not spend time with one particular person.
``Once I had established someone was breathing and had a pulse, I moved on to
the next. If the person was unconscious, I placed them on their sides to
prevent the risk of choking.
``I was on auto-pilot, in a mode I had never experienced before. Everything
clicked,'' Mr McIlwraith said.
However, he admits, his overall experience of the event was ``nothing short of
chaos''.
That is not a criticism, more a reflection on what was happening: ``No-one had
anticipated such a tragedy would every occur and it is possibly a reaction to
the horror of it all.''
At the time, Mr McIlwraith was an apprentice metallurgist and had been a corps
officer for about eight months.
He is now commandant of a Rutherglen corps and works full time for St Andrew's
Ambulance Association, involved mainly in health and safety in the workplace.

THE number of confirmed cases of Potato Brown Rot in the Netherlands has
advanced to 60 after remaining on 46 for more than two months.
The 14 new cases were identified during the final phase of a special testing
programme designed to screen the 250 farms deemed to be most at risk.
Spread throughout the Netherlands, the high-risk farms were identified as
having used seed from the same clonal source as was planted on the farm which
produced the first Brown Rot case in Holland. That case, discovered at the end
of September this year, led to a #3m testing programme which gave priority
attention to all clonal contact farms.
All potatoes grown on these farms were examined for evidence of Brown Rot
infection. Bacteria collected from any sample which gave cause for concern were
put through a growth test using tomato plants. The 14 new cases all failed the
growth test.
With all 250 of the high-risk farms now screened, the result is that 190 are
clean and have been freed to operate as normal, while the 60 diseased fields
have been put on a strict five-year non-potato production regime.
All infected fields must be put to grass for the next three years, after which
they can either be left in grass or used to produce a non-potato crop for a
further two years. The next available potato season therefore cannot be begin
until the year 2001.
Ministry of Agriculture officials in the Netherlands have still not reached a
decision on whether or not to allow potatoes to be grown on clean fields within
a farm which has a confirmed Brown Rot field.
EU plant health inspectors have visited the Netherlands during the past few
weeks and will be reporting their findings to the EU Plant Health Standing
Committee early in the New Year.
Meanwhile, both seed and ware potatoes grown on farms within a three-kilometre
radius of an infected field have to be tested and declared clear of Brown Rot
before they can be offered for sale.
All seed potatoes have to be tested and declared clear of Brown Rot before they
can be issued with a plant passport for export.
As an additional health protection measure, all cyclists, walkers and hunters
have been warned, through their various clubs and associations, to avoid
crossing any of the 60 diseased fields to halt the spread of Brown Rot.

AS Scotland shivered, the coldest place of all was Altnaharra, a hamlet in the
Highlands.
An early-morning temperature reading of -23C shot the group of 20 houses and a
hotel in the middle of Sutherland into the national spotlight yesterday.
The village lies 23 miles North of Lairg on the single-track road to Tongue, on
Sutherland's north coast.
Yesterday, postmistress Lesley Wilkie told how she, her farm manager husband
Alan, and youngsters Gillian and Keith feared they would not make it home when
the fierce blizzards struck on Christmas Eve after a shopping trip to Lairg.
However, super-chilled temperatures are nothing new to self-made Scots
millionaire Jim Gray, 55, who owns the 36,000-acre Altnaharra Estate, which
gives year-round employment to Alan Wilkie and to two gamekeepers.
Mr Gray is joint founder of Gray and Adams, the company based in Fraserburgh,
Aberdeenshire, Britain's leading manufacturer of freezer lorry trailers.
His company, which he started from scratch in 1957, now employs 300 at their
Fraserburgh factory, while a further 300 work at their manufacturing plants in
Dunfermline, Yorkshire, and Northern Ireland.
Mr Gray said: ``Minus 23? There's nothing new about that for me. That is
exactly the temperature at which the articulated wagons we make carry frozen
food from Europe to supermarkets throughout Britain.''
He bought the Altnaharra Estate from Lord Kimball, formerly Tory MP Sir Marcus
Kimball last year ``as a place for a bit of relaxation away from business
pressures''.
Although he lives at Memsie, near Fraserburgh, the self-made tycoon frequently
travels to Altnaharra for salmon angling.
There are eight youngsters at single classroom Altnaharra school run by under
headmistress Mrs Anne Mackay.
The 20-bedroom Altnaharra Hotel has recently been completely refurbished by its
Danish owners Anne and Daniel Tuscher.
Postie Alistair Mackay brings the mail to Altnaharra every day from Lairg
around lunchtime and he also delivers milk and daily newspapers to the folk in
the scattered community.
Altnaharra was luckier than many other remote communities in that its power
supply was only cut for eight hours on Christmas Eve.
Mr Wilkie looks after the hill farm with its flock of 1200 sheep. There are
also around 100 arable acres close to the village, which supports a herd of
Irish cattle.
The Wilkies have been in Altnaharra for three years. Previously, Alan worked on
a farm at Insch, Aberdeenshire. Lesley's pride and joy are her three horses - a
thoroughbred mare, a prize-winning Connemara pony, and a Shetland pony.
Yesterday, she said: ``This is definitely the coldest weather I have ever
experienced. It is bitter but the sun is shining and thankfully there is hardly
any wind, so it is bearable. Living in Altnaharra took a bit of getting used to
but we are all very h
appy here now, despite all the frost and snow.''

IT could have cost them #100,000 - but bookies would rather have seen a white
Christmas in London than faced the white-out that has confined race horses to
their stables across the country.
Boxing Day, normally one of the busiest days of the year for turf accountants,
was dismally quiet as - with the exception of one meeting in Limerick, all
races in the UK and Ireland were called off because of frozen tracks.
It was the first white-out for horse racing for 33 years.
Nearly all horse racing has been cancelled for the rest of the week - only
Wolverhampton will be offering action, with fixtures on its all-weather ground
on Saturday.
Punters have been left with the option of putting their money on dogs or South
African horse racing, which they can monitor via satellite.
Darts, American football, and rugby events are also coming up, but football -
the other main attraction for gamblers - will be devastated this weekend.
Only four games are likely to go ahead, at grounds with undersoil heating -
Rangers v Hibs, Hamilton Accies v St Mirren, Dundee United v Airdrie, and
Queen's Park v Ross County.
Horse racing fan Bob Hunter said yesterday: ``There's nothing for me to do. I'm
on holiday until January 3 and I like to punt as a hobby, but there's nothing
for me to punt on.
``South African horse racing is a joke, there's no detailed form. Punters at
the bookmaker's know the horses they're going in for, but with South Africa
it's only numbers.
``When there's been a bad winter in the past, there's always something
organised but this year it's absolutely terrible. It's bad organisation by the
British Horse Racing Board.''
Mr Jack Smith, a director of Glasgow-based John Smith Bookmakers, says his
turnover and profit are both 50% down this week. Most of the regular customers
at his betting office in West Nile Street - one of seven in Glasgow and
Coatbridge - are staying at h
ome.
Mr Smith said:``There are so many meetings on Boxing Day that a few usually
survive if the weather turns bad.
``We need continuity so that the punters who are coming in know what they are
doing. Once you have a break, it affects profitability.''
A spokesman for Ladbrokes bookmakers said: ``Betting shops have a social
atmosphere. People are coming in for only a couple of minutes instead of 15.
``It's true that we didn't have to pay out on the white Christmas bets but we
would rather have paid out on that than lost Boxing Day.''
Mr John Smee, spokesman for the British Horse Racing Board, said it needed
three days' notice to re-arrange fixtures.
He added: ``The weather forecasts are not particularly good and a lot of race
courses were making positive noises up until Boxing Day morning.
``If we had known three days before Boxing Day that we would be faced with a
white-out, we could have had all-weather track racing.
``The only fixtures we can line up are at all-weather tracks and we have begun
to do that.
Mr Smee said additional fixtures being staged this week would not be regarded
as cost effective by the Levy Board, the Government body which collects revenue
and distributes it as prize money.

KEITH BRUCE gets a special preview of the new season at the Citizens' Theatre
THE characteristic combination of imagination and thrift is evident in a
slimmed-down spring season at Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre. As he acknowledged
publicly for the first time at the theatre's 25th anniversary celebrations,
artistic director Giles Have
rgal is proud of his reputation for tailoring the drama to the cloth available.
Havergal has been outspoken over the past year about the dangers to arts
funding inherent in local government reorganisation and in the run up to the
effecting of that change at the end of March, the Citizens' programme is an
acknowledgment of the uncerta
inties that lie ahead. While nothing is a bankable certainty on the stage, in
the Gorbals there is clearly an attitude of ``safety first'', with all bar one
of Citz spaces spending time ``dark'', and three of the six productions being
revivals.
While he denies that financial considerations outweighed artistic ones,
Havergal admits the problems.
``Every playlist is a balance of what we want to do and what resources are
available and the spring season is always a tricky slot, because it is time to
hit that target.''
Although neither of the autumn's Edinburgh Festival transfers - Don Carlos or
TAG's adaptation of Alasdair Gray's Lanark - produced the hoped-for audiences
in Glasgow, Havergal insists that the Citizens' is ``doing OK at the moment'',
with healthy receipt
s from the Christmas production, Pinocchio.
It is followed on to the main stage by Havergal's adaptation of Graham Greene's
Travels With My Aunt, a three-hander performed by himself, Patrick Hannaway and
Derwent Watson - last seen at Mayfest in 1990 before transfering to the Lyric
in London. Its su
ccess was originally born of economic pressures when Havergal staged it as an
inexpensive end to a season of lavish productions. ``I'll just do something
myself in a pullover,'' he is quoted as saying. The revival runs from January
26 to February 17.
The next production in the same space is Harry Gibson's eagerly anticipated
follow-up to Trainspotting, his adaptation of Irvine Welsh's Marabou Stork
Nightmares, from March 1 for three weeks.
During the same period Citizens' head of design Kenny Miller follows up his
directorial debut (Look Back in Anger this year) with the stalls studio's only
spring show: Jean Cocteau's The Human Voice. This short piece consists entirely
of a woman talking o
n the telephone to her lover, an initially cordial conversation which
degenerates.
The Circle Studio is the theatre's busiest spring space, and houses two
familiar pieces and one intriguing rarity. Don't Start Me was a hit at the
Edinburgh Fringe for CPT (formerly Castlemilk People's Theatre). Ford Kiernan
and John Paul Leach's two-hand
er about Scottish stand-up Tasty McDade was described as ``memorable and richly
characterised'' by The Herald's Sara Villiers.
Lookout theatre's date rape play, Easy, by company founder Nicola McCartney,
returns to the theatre after a successful run in Mayfest last year and before
being made into a film by director John McGrath.
During March the studio sees what may be the British premiere of a late and
rare Tennessee Williams' In the bar of a Tokyo hotel.
n Booking for the Citizens' new season opens on Thursday January 4, Box Office
0141 429 0022.

Her looks first took her to the top but it is her new found belief in herself
that has ensured that Cybill Shepherd has overcome all the ups and downs of her
career, finds Douglas Thompson
SHE'S back. Again. Hollywood has pronounced Cybill Shepherd dead so often
investment in the resurrection business might be wise. Today she's very much
alive wearing a wintry - for California - outfit of snug-fitting camel jacket
over a dark brown polo-nec
ked sweater and long skirt, matching boots and, as usual, her heart on her
sleeve and a quip on her lip.
This is the lady who matches diamonds and emeralds with T-shirts and jeans and
smart remarks with demure glances.
She's lived her life with the fickle abandon of a 21st century Scarlett O'Hara
but at this moment Cybill Shepherd is more interested in Scott Fitzgerald's
take on life than Margaret Mitchell's: ``He said there are no second acts to
American careers but I
feel like this is my third act.''
Or is it fourth?
We're on the set of, appropriately, Cybill her new television series which is a
runaway success in America and is now being seen in Britain on satellite. She
used to bicycle from her Colonial-style two-storey home across the Sepulveda
Pass while she was m
aking Moonlighting but now its a flat run - by limousine - along Ventura
Boulevard to the CBS TV buildings in Studio City.
You find her on Stage 15 - at the junction of Gunsmoke Avenue and Newhart
Street - where she is the star and executive producer of what the television
executives call ``a bawdy adult comedy''.
Cybill Shepherd does good bawdy. And body.
It's on uplifting display on her hit TV series in which she's Cybill Sheridan,
a fortysomething actress who is the single mother to two daughters (Zoey
Woodbine and Michelle Pfeiffer's sister Deedee) by different fathers.
The series, she smiles, is ``loosely based on my own life''. Indeed, she says
it is the life she would have had if not for the worldwide success of the
extravagantly delightful Moonlighting. Except she would have had ``a bunch of
different kids by differe
nt men. Not just two.''
She went from home in Memphis, Tennessee, where she dated Elvis (``It was
mythic. He looked great. And he smelled great'') to magazine covergirl to movie
star in what seemed like a deep breath between 1968 and 1974. That included her
turn as the icy cool
blonde in Peter Bogdanovich's landmark 1971 film The Last Picture Show.
Bogdanovich became her lover (it lasted seven years) and mentor (he still is)
and together they went on to make a series of films which flopped. She became a
box office pariah. And th
en The Comeback Kid.
Along the way she married hometown boy David Ford and their daughter Clementine
is now 15. During the filming of Moonlighting she met the ``other Bruce'' - to
distinguish him from her co-star Bruce Willis - the chiropractor Bruce
Oppenheim and they have s
even-year-old twins Ariel and Zachariah.
She's now living with her children and musician Robert Martin, 46, (''the best
sex I've ever had'') who she met 18 months ago when he joined her cabaret
singing tour. At 45, Cybill Shepherd has a lot happening in her life.
There's the children, the ex-husbands, the nannies, the boyfriend, the high
profile careers (acting and singing). It sounds like a television series. There
is one sure fire comparison - Cybill is the boss on and off screen: ``I'm my
own person. No-one's t
rying to tell me what to do.''
She explains what she is trying to do with her TV series: ``I wanted to deal
honestly with a woman character who is in her prime - sexually and in every
other way. My age is the best time there is to be a woman. It used to be
middle-aged woman simply vani
shed. Look at me, I'm a spokesperson for a hair care product. I'm less of a
sexual object. It's kind of a relief not to be recognised just for my sexuality
and beauty.
``They used to say 35 was a woman's sexual prime. Listen, 40 is when it really
starts to get good. For me it was about getting over the fear of saying what
excites me. It was about finding a man you can feel safe with and tell what you
like, who will tell
you what he likes.
``It's only taken me 20 years to figure all this out. Twenty years to figure
out how to be myself.''
And that is what she's being. She has a pair of plastic breasts stuck to the
ceiling of her dressing room. Her own are equally noticeable.
``My first ex-husband asked our daughter if I'd had a boob job after he saw the
pilot show and I thought that was wonderful - especially since I hadn't had to
go to all that trouble. It was just one of those amazing Frederick's bras that
was very reasonab
le. Eighteen dollars. They're great. It's called The Captivator. Or The
Procrastinator. I don't know. Well, you could procrastinate while you're
captivating I guess. I strongly recommend them.
``I went through a period when I saw myself ageing. I'm certainly more aware of
ageing than ever before but beauty is as beauty does. That was drilled into my
head as I was growing up. I work out but its never gotten so bad where I'm
living on only aspara
gus. I've never been anorexic. You can tell by looking at me. When I was
modelling they had to tear the clothes to get them on me. I'm a big American
girl.
``But you have to work out unless you go through one of those gruesome tummy
tucks which they say is so painful. And once you start where do you stop? Fix
your stomach and what are you going to do about your ass?
``I hate the idea of plastic surgery. I don't want to say never but it's
important to me to learn to love the physical aspects of ageing myself.''
It's taken her a long time to love Bruce Willis. Now she is philosophical but
during the four-year run (from 1985 to 1989) of Moonlighting there was much
turmoil and an ongoing feud between the co-stars. Her memory is selective for a
moment as she says of
the series that brought her back from the dead: ``I loved every moment of
it.'' Pause. ``What am I saying?'' You want to know which minutes I didn't
love, right? It was like the best of times and the worst of times.
``We used to have fights before we had fights on screen and that went on for a
year and half before we realised that was our method of acting. I became a
success as a model when I was 18. But on Moonlighting Bruce was going through
that first success and
I had to pay for it. I took the success for granted. For Bruce to suddenly go
from not being successful to appearing to get everything that you want was very
stressful.
``I've never had a problem standing up for myself but it was like what Bette
Davis said - and man does that and he's admired, a woman does that and she's a
bitch.
``But he got actually very nice at the end. I think his marriage to Demi Moore
just had a wonderful influence on him. I don't fight with him anymore. We had a
wonderful conversation about three to four months ago and he offered to come on
the show and do
a little part. The hatchets are buried. The water is under the bridge. What
other cliches can you think of?
``I'm ready to do Moonlighting: The Sequel but I don't know. I think I'm the
only one. Anyway why are we talking about Bruce Willis? He needs more
publicity? He's certainly not making enough money......''
On Cybill her alter ego is on the lookout for a man if not a full-time mate.
What she calls ``the husband part'' is confused. ``It's not so much the
marriage part that I want to knock. I didn't do too well at it. But just
because I failed at it and am qui
te leery doesn't mean never again. I certainly wouldn't like to warn other
people off. I think Peter Bogdanovich and I were the first unmarried couple to
appear on a major publication some years ago and we were thoroughly trounced.
``How dare they say that not being married is sexier ..... I don't know about
the sexiness part. My marriages coincided so close with giving birth and giving
birth is not the sexiest thing in the world.''
Bogdanovich she credits with being one of the few people who realise ``my brain
isn't blonde''. She resents not having had children with him. She says there
were emotional difficulties over the years but now all is calm.
``It's really self-knowledge. I don't think I figured out anything until after
40. I really don't. This has to be the best time because you just really know
yourself. You make the same old mistakes - you don't suddenly become perfect.
But we change. We gr
ow and need different things.
``Suddenly, for me, I got far more particular. I figured out really what I
wanted and for the first time in my life was prepared to wait for it. No man
was better than the wrong man. There was a period where I went to all my events
by myself and it was ve
ry difficult. It's hard for women. The ultimate status symbol in our culture,
we are taught as we grow up, is a man on your arm. And you are only as good as
the man that you're with so to break away from that takes a lot of courage and
it didn't happen to
me overnight.''
She is changing. In upcoming episodes of her series being screened in America
she is to become a grandmother. A glamorous granny?
``That was my idea and producers said: `We admire you - you're so brave.' As if
I was saying I was going to cut my head off or something!
``Grandparents and raising children! First of all the fastest growing group in
America is over 60. Our whole world has changed radically in terms of ageing.
It's just a totally different world and we're shooting ourselves in the foot
not to develop the re
sources of our elders.
``I think the fact that I have this job at all and do what I do has a lot to do
with our changing world and the way we treat our elders. The whole cult of
youth is so destructive for everybody including the young.''
For a world class, outrageous flirt like Cybill Shepherd this is thoughtful
stuff. She realises it.
Much more telling is the trivia that her star on the Hollywood Walk Fame is
outside the Roosevelt Hotel which is but a hip-swivel away from the shop of the
original sex-in-lingerie people Frederick's of Hollywood.
Was it the Procrastinator? Or the Captivator?
Uplifting no matter what you call it.

PEOPLE have a greater fear than ever of being caught drink driving, according
to police chiefs.
Police believe this is supported by a fall in the number of drivers whose tests
have proved positive in the five weeks up until yesterday.
A total of 880 drivers provided positive tests, 18 drivers fewer than the same
period last year, according to figures released by the Association of Chief
Police Officers in Scotland (Acpos).
The decrease comes against a background of a huge rise in the number of drivers
stopped by Scotland's eight police forces. A total of 67,592 have been stopped
since the start of the Scottish Police Forces campaign launched on November 24
- a rise of 60% o
n the same period last year.
Mr Ian Mackinnon, secretary of the traffic standing committee of Acpos, and
Strathclyde assistant chief constable (traffic), welcomed the continued trend
but pledged that forces throughout Scotland would continue their efforts
against drink-drivers over t
he New Year holiday period and beyond. ``I am heartened to see a decrease in
the number of positive tests and I think it reflects a greater fear of being
detected drink-driving this year than ever before,'' he said.
However, he also warned drivers to take extra care in the current icy condition
which ``make for very dangerous driving conditions even without a driver taking
a drink''..

<HEADLINE>`In last year's mild winter, 239 Scots died of hypothermia - a cold statistic and a damning indictment' SNP plans cold payments Bill</HEADLINE>

THERE were renewed calls yesterday for a complete overhaul of the Government's
cold-weather payment scheme.
Mrs Margaret Ewing, parliamentary leader of the Scottish National Party,
announced she would be introducing a new Cold Climate Allowance Bill in the
next parliamentary session.
She said: ``The winter chaos and discomfort this year has been compounded by
the Government's ramshackle cold-weather payments system. This system, which is
manifestly unfair, given the need for sub-zero temperatures for seven
consecutive days before paym
ents are triggered, has been shown to be totally inadequate by the extreme
conditions over recent days.
``Last year, during what was a relatively mild winter, 239 Scots died of
hypothermia - a cold statistic which is a damning indictment of the negligible
support provided by the UK Government.''
As the controversy raged, a soup kitchen was set up at Cliasmol School by a
band of worried volunteers on Harris. Soup and food was being handed out to
shivering locals and electricity company workers battling to restore power to
50 homes on the island.
The SNP proposes weekly payments in southern Scotland from December to March of
#7.40, and #11.15 in northern Scotland. ``The total cost of such a system in
Scotland would be #170m per annum - less than 6% of the expected #3000m in
North Sea revenues next
year,'' said Mrs Ewing.
Meanwhile, Mr David Logan, convener of the Campaign for Cold-Weather Credits,
called for a system to ensure that people on benefit could afford to burn
enough fuel to keep warm during the winter months.
Ross, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy yesterday joined Western Isles MP
Calum Macdonald in demanding action from the Prime Minister and Social Security
Secretary Peter Lilley over the failure of Stornoway and Tiree weather
monitoring stations to tri
gger cold-weather payments.
The Tiree station acts as the trigger for a large part of central and Wester
Ross and Mr Kennedy said that he would now be writing to Mr Lilley asking for a
joint meeting when Parliament resumes. Mr Macdonald has already written to the
Prime Minister.
Mr Kennedy said: ``For years, I have been campaigning in Parliament for this
trigger point to be changed. It is clearly insane that Tiree should be used as
a guide for areas and communities like Garve, Torridon, and Ullapool.
``Successive Social Security Ministers have tried to maintain the nonsensical
proposition that Tiree could be regarded as indicative for these parts of my
constituency. That never was a remotely tenable argument and this latest
breathtaking revelation kil
ls it stone dead once and for all.
``I fully endorse Calum's call for a prime ministerial intervention and I am
working with him on this twin-track approach involving Peter Lilley as well.
The immediate crisis must be put right by urgent ministerial intervention.
Thereafter, we need a comp
lete reassessment of the weather station monitoring map, self-evidently a
discredited fiction.
``This entire fiasco would have been turned down as an episode for Yes Minister
on the grounds that it would be too far-fetched. It would be funny if it wasn't
so serious and downright unjust for people losing out in such a blatant
fashion.''
Shetland communities yesterday were continuing to help each other to cope with
the severe storms, which have left many homes isolated. In spite of further
snow falls, the situation was improving.
A Hydro-Electric spokes-woman said last night all electricity supplies on
Shetland had been restored.
She added that work was still being done to restore power to about 50 homes in
the Western Isles.
As food convoys left Lerwick to remote areas, Shetland Islands Council was
monitoring the situation to decide whether or not it would need to accept
external offers of help, including the use of troops.
Yesterday, Shetland coastguard continued to take over the role of the local
ambulances unable to operate on snowbound roads by airlifting two elderly
women, one from West Burra and the other from Sandwick, to hospital in Lerwick.
They also carried out a n
umber of other medical evacuations.
Mr Derek Cox, the director of public health, urged the elderly to keep their
heating on to ensure they were warm.
He said one of the dangers was that some elderly people were not aware of how
cold they were becoming and because they didn't shiver they didn't have the
sensation of being cold and could slip into hypothermia.
However, he said the network of GPs, health workers, and home helps throughout
the islands were being very successful in checking on the welfare of anyone who
might give cause for concern.
Mr Bill Bennett, the council's director of social work, echoed that message. He
said: ``Those on income support should not worry about fuel bills but should
contact the social work department for assistance.''
Chief Inspector William Murray, of Northern Constabulary, said the response to
the emergency had been a co-ordinated effort and public safety remained of
paramount concern. The police urged people in rural areas to make contact with
neighbours to ensure t
hey had adequate warmth and food supplies.
They also issued a warning that people should not travel unless absolutely
necessary to leave roads clear for the snow ploughs.
Shetland Islands Council is concentrating on clearing the main spine roads
throughout Shetland and yesterday they were passable by four-wheel-drive
vehicles. The worst hit area is to the west, where some areas are still
inaccessible.
Mr Joe Gray, director of roads and transport, said the council was doing its
best to deal with all inquiries. The isles of Skerries and Whalsay had supplies
delivered by ferry and arrangements have been made for similar deliveries to
Yell and Unst today.
Yesterday, a convoy of essential supplies from wholesalers in Lerwick was
delivered to rural shops with snow ploughs leading the way to clear any hazards.
This morning, 1500 propane and butane gas cylinders will arrive by ferry from
Aberdeen to help ease the shortage caused by the weather. Sumburgh Airport was
open yesterday and the local bus company was able to operate between Lerwick
and the airport.

A MOTHER stricken by conscience may hold a vital clue to the identity of the
killer of Kilmarnock schoolgirl Mhairi Julyan.
The detective leading the murder inquiry yesterday disclosed that a letter,
apparently written by a concerned mother, had been received by the Julyan
family at their home in the town's Samson Avenue.
Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder said the letter had been posted in the
Kilmarnock area earlier this week and had been received by Mhairi's parents on
Wednesday morning.
He declined to discuss the contents of the anonymous letter in detail but said
there were ``very clear indications'' that the letter came from a concerned
mother who had important information about the identity of the killer.
Mr Lauder added: ``It is vital that the author of this letter gets in touch
with me at the incident room as soon as possible in order that I can discuss
the contents of the letter with her.
``I assure this person that the information will be treated in the strictest
confidence and I will be happy to meet her anywhere at any time to have a
discussion about what she has written and what she knows.
``My message to the woman who wrote this letter is clear - it is important that
the person who carried out this awful crime is dealt with and while I know it
is a major hurdle, you must force yourself to get over it and contact us at
once . . . it will gi
ve you peace of mind as well as helping the Julyan family and the entire
community to come to terms with the loss of a young girl.
``It will not bring her back but I believe it will help if we can bring this
inquiry to a conclusion.''
Meantime, the murder squad, boosted by detectives from every division of
Strathclyde as well as the Major Crime Resource Unit, will assess the
information contained in the letter and follow up other important leads.
Mr Lauder conceded there was a possibility the letter was not genuine and
added: ``If that is the case, it would be a quite dreadful hoax to perpetrate
on a grieving family.''
He said it was unusual for such a communication to be received by the victim's
family, although sympathy cards and messages of support had come from the
immediate area and beyond.
Mr Lauder said another possible sighting of Mhairi - this time at the junction
of London Road and Nursery Avenue - on the evening of December 16 had been
reported.
He again urged anyone with the slightest piece of information to get in touch.
``No-one should think they are cluttering up the inquiry by making a call.
Their small piece of information could be vital.
``We are not going to go away. We are here until the person is found and the
inquiry closed.''
Mhairi, a fifth-year pupil at Kilmarnock Academy, disappeared on December 16
while on her way home from a pantomime at the Palace Theatre.
Her body was discovered in the Stagecoach bus depot in McKinlay Place, a few
hundred yards from her home, the next afternoon.
q A father yesterday made an emotional appeal for the safe return of his
teenage daughter who disappeared after a Christmas Eve disco.
Delivery driver Robert Smith, 49, pleaded for news of his daughter Louise, 18,
at a police news conference.
In a personal message, he said: ``Louise, we all love you. Please get in touch
by any means. We want you back.''
She disappeared early onChristmas morning following the disco at Spirals
nightclub in the heart of Yate, near Bristol.
Police are investigating the possibility that she was sighted shortly after 2am
in the passenger seat of a blue Ford Escort driven by a female friend called
Emma. Police are still trying to trace the friend and the car.

TOUGH measures to reduce delays in processing planning applications were
announced yesterday by Mr George Kynoch, Scottish Local Government Minister.
The changes, detailed in a review of the town and country planning system,
include performance targets along with tighter timetables for dealing with
planning applications and appeals.
\Performance targets will cover the progress of structure plan reviews,
national guidance and advice, decisions on individual cases as well as the work
of the Scottish Office Inquiry Reporters' Unit.
According to the Scottish Office, good progress has been made in this area and
work will continue towards meeting the target of 28 weeks for public local
inquiry cases by the end of 1996.
Once met, it is intended to tighten further the target for written submission
cases to 26 weeks.

SIX thousand skiers and snow-boarders enjoyed superb conditions on Scotland's
slopes yesterday.......the busiest day of the festive break so far.
Temperatures at the five Scots winter sports centres remained well below zero
all day, while clear blue skies, with hardly any winds, were the order of the
day.
Road access was clear to all centres. However, some resorts still do not have
as much snow as they would like and the White Corries Centre in Glencoe has yet
to open for the season.
The excellent skiing conditions will continue today and operators of all
resorts are keeping their fingers crossed that the settled but bitterly cold
spell of weather will continue beyond Hogmanay.
Not so the homeless and those working to keep them off the streets during
Scotland's big chill.
Shelter in Scotland director Ms Liz Nicholson said homeless people in the
larger cities had a wide range of hostels to choose from but those in smaller
towns were less fortunate.
In Glasgow, emergency accommodation is being provided through the city
council's Winter Watch Campaign between December and March. Under the scheme,
now in its third year, a number of places in hostels across the city are kept
for those who need accommoda
tion in an emergency.
The campaign is run through the Hamish Allan Centre, a hostel in Centre Street,
which links to other hostels in the city to provide beds.
The centre itself has 24 emergency places available.
Operations director Brian O'Hara said: ``We have had 62 presentations since the
beginning of the campaign and we have been able to accommodate them all.''
He said Glasgow did not need an emergency shelter for when the weather turned
bad: ``We do not have a homelessness problem on the scale of that in London.''
Ms Margaret Stevenson, director of the Talbot Association, a hostel also
involved in the campaign, agreed. ``Glasgow is unique as it has an adequate
number of places,'' Ms Stevenson said. ``There tends to be a place for everyone
who needs and wants it. Th
ere are small groups of people that just won't come in and we take food and
blankets to them.''
Major Raymond Ward, team leader for the Glasgow Homeless for the Salvation
Army, said: ``At this time of year, we get people who would normally sleep
rough. There aren't actually a big proportion of these in Glasgow.''
However, he does believe a large emergency accommodation centre would help.
Meanwhile, it became clear yesterday that the major problems in the storm-hit
parts of northern Scotland have arisen in areas where the original power-lines,
dating back 40 years, are still in use.
Hydro-Electric are spending #20m a year on replacing old lines. About 1000
miles of overhead lines will be replaced each year out of a total of 30,000
miles of cables carried by electric poles in the whole of northern Scotland.
In the Western Isles alone the privatised company has spent #41m on line
renewals during the past five years. A Hydro-Electric spokesman said: ``We are
seeing a clear link between the age of the lines and problems with cuts in
power supply during the pres
ent emergency.''
He said almost all the areas which suffered serious power supply problems were
still served by the network erected when the Highlands and Islands were
electrified in the late 1940s and 1950s.
Earlier this year, the company was the only privatised electricity utility in
Britain to refuse an order from the Government's Electricity Regulator to cut
power costs by 10% over a three-year period.
Hydro-Electric's chairman Lord Wilson of Tillyorn argued then that his company
was a special case because of the very long mileage of rural supply lines which
needed to be replaced.
He won his case in an appeal to the Government's Monopolies and Merger
Commission.

THE introduction of Republic of Ireland-style tax breaks and the establishment
of a single organisation to oversee policy and strategy were among proposals
put forward yesterday by the SNP to boost Scotland's post-Braveheart film
industry.
The plans, which will be contained in a consultation document to be published
in the new year, have been formulated after discussions with the country's
major film organisations and leading industry figures.
Ms Roseanna Cunningham, the SNP's parliamentary spokesperson on film, said:
``Future success depends on a sustainable level of domestic production that
will result in regular success for low and medium-budget films and the
attraction of international film
s to be shot in Scotland. Our consultations have led us to propose two
essential first steps.
``The first is the introduction by Government of tax breaks for production,
which must be modelled on the highly successful `Section 35' Irish scheme.''
Film investment from private sources, which Ms Cunningham also regarded as
vital, would not be forthcoming to any significant degree unless these tax
breaks were in place.
In the Republic, as a means of encouraging new work, a film company is allowed
to write off tax for new investment. To qualify, it has to prove that the
project is worthwhile, that a proportion of the budget will be spent on
training, and that the film wi
ll employ an Irish crew.
The policy has met with startling success. At present, there are 80 movie
projects in development in Ireland. In Scotland, there are 20. The tax breaks
were in part responsible for Mel Gibson's decision to move filming from
Scotland to Ireland for the hug
e battle scenes in Braveheart.
Though the eventual tax advantages did little more than cover the costs of
moving location, Gibson admitted that the Irish had been enormously helpful,
providing thousands of extras from the ranks of the Irish army and around 600
horses. It is this climat
e of assistance, as much as the tax breaks, which the SNP wants to create in
Scotland.
To this end, the Nationalists' chief executive, Mr Mike Russell, disclosed that
the second essential step would be the establishment of Scottish Screen, a
federated organisation which would bring together existing bodies such as the
Scottish Film Council,
the Scottish Film Production Fund, Scottish Screen Locations, and the Scottish
Broadcasting and Film Training Trust. It would be a ``one-stop shop'' for
film-makers.
It would also include a new department, responsible for marketing and
distributing Scottish films at home and - more importantly - abroad.
Further down the line, the party also proposed the establishment of a Scottish
Film School and the creation of a major sound stage for film and television
production.

PRIVATE sector tenants in the south and west of Glasgow have won a battle to
stop their landlord imposing a #1450 rent increase.
The Western Heritable Investment Company failed to convince the Rent Assessment
Committee that the rents of 539 properties in Kings Park, Croftfoot,
Hillington, Cardonald, and Kelvindale should be increased from the #2150
suggested by the Rent Officer to
#3600.
The tenants were represented by Aitkenhead councillor Louise Fyfe, who said
last night: ``These properties are occupied mostly by elderly tenants and tend
to be in a poor state of repair. Many of the tenants have great difficulty
getting their landlord to
carry out repairs efficiently, yet there is a move for this massive increase.''
It is the tenants' second victory against Western Heritable. A 1992 decision by
the Rent Assessment Committee to restrict rents for the same properties to
#1860 was upheld in the Court of Session last June.
At a recent hearing concerning the latest rents proposals, Western Heritable
claimed tenants had no grounds for complaint about repairs.
The company argued that similar properties were being rented for #3600 on the
open market. It also argued that it was not part of the company's function to
look after elderly tenants.
However, tenants' evidence suggested that many of the properties were in a poor
state of repair and that many tenants suffered from water penetration, poor
sound insulation, unsafe wiring, crumbling steps and pathways, and leaking
doors, windows, gutters,
and roofs.
The committee visited a sample of the houses and expressed ``concern'' about
the condition of some of the properties.
Councillor Fyfe said the #3600 rents proposed by Western Heritable were kept
artificially high by the Housing Benefit system and by the shortage of rented
housing in the area.
She said similar properties in the area, including Housing Association
properties, had rents set at #2150.
Mr Tom Rowlands, manager of Western Heritable's Glasgow Office, said: ``We are
disappointed. We feel we presented enough evidence to show that a market rent
was #3600.
``However, it was not sufficient to convince the committee that it was the way
to go about making their decision on rents. They decided they would prefer to
use comparable rents, which other rent officers had already set.''
A company decision on the possibility of an appeal to the Court of Session will
not be made until the board of directors has considered the decision in detail.

ECONOMY
THE CBI yesterday described prospects for the economy over the next two years
as ``generally encouraging''.
It believes economic growth, following on from November's Budget, will be 2.5%
next year, rising to 2.8% in 1997.
In a New Year message to members, chairman Sir Bryan Nicholson said: ``We are
cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the economy following the prudent
Budget and the early interest rate cut.
``We now seem on track for sustainable non-inflationary growth over the next
two years. We expect consumer spending to be the mainstay of this economic
growth as real incomes rise and the inflation outlook remains positive.''
Sir Bryan said the CBI is forecasting that underlying inflation, which excludes
mortgage interest payments, will stand at 2.8% by the end of 1996, falling back
to 2.7% by the end of 1997. This is close to the mid-point of the Government's
1% -4% target ra
nge.
``Providing we are able to maintain firm control of costs, we should see
unemployment fall very close to the psychologically important two million mark.
``By the end of 1996 we expect unemployment to be 2.19 million, falling to 2.07
million by the end of 1997.''
However, Sir Bryan warned of some uncertainties facing the economy in the short
term. ``Our latest monthly trends survey shows that UK manufacturers expect a
slowdown in output growth in the first part of the new year and that stocks of
finished goods are
at their highest level since November 1992.''
He said the CBI was also concerned about key European export markets, where it
predicts demand will continue to remain weak into the new year.
On interest rates, he believes the time might soon be right for a further
reduction. ``We are keeping a close check on the moderating pace of growth
among manufacturers.
``If this continues and inflation remains under control, we would support a
further cut in interest rates to provide a stimulus to business growth.''

LLOYDS Abbey Life, the life insurer owned in part by Lloyds Bank, is selling
its German life subsidiary, Transleben for #50m cash. The buyer is a German
company, writes NICOLA REEVES.
The purchase price, payable after a final injection of DM5m (#2.2m) for
solvency purposes to Transleben by Abbey Life, represents a deficit against
book value of #35m.
Transleben, whose primary markets are personal and small businesses in Germany,
has been loss-making in recent years. In 1994, it made a pre-tax loss of #13.6m
but is thought to have reduced this year's deficit to #5m. It was Abbey Life's
only non-UK fina
ncial services business.
City analysts believe that the disposal is at a reasonable price and is broadly
positive for Abbey Life. The disposal had been expected for some time. News of
the sale at a substantial discount knocked Abbey Life's shares down 4p to 449p.
However the disp
osal is expected to be slightly earnings enhancing next year.
While Lloyds Abbey Life is getting out of European markets Royal Insurance is
expanding its overseas network with the opening of its first Italian office on
January 1, outside Milan. The group already employs 22,000 people in 90
countries. The Italian off
ice will offer direct car insurance seven days a week.
The move illustrates Royal's confidence in southern Europe. It already has an
Italian subsidiary, Lloyd Italico, offering personal lines insurance with a
market share of about 1%. In addition it has a substantial share of the direct
Catalan motor market t
hrough Regal of Barcelona.
Following liberalisation of the Italian motor insurance market there has been
increased interest in direct services in what is a relatively under-developed
sector. In contrast, the UK motor insurance market remains highly competitive.

AMSTRAD'S chief executive David Rogers is to leave the computer and consumer
electronics group in January after only 17 months in the post, it was announced
yesterday.
Mr Rogers was recruited from Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, principally
to beef up the group's traditional consumer electronics business after chairman
Alan Sugar decided to withdraw from high street price wars by selling personal
computers and bus
iness equipment direct to customers. The reorganisation of the consumer
electronics business - including video recorders, stereo systems and satellite
- was part of a wholesale restructuring undertaken by Mr Rogers.
In a brief statement Amstrad said: ``Following a strategic review of the future
prospects of Amstrad's traditional business, Amstrad Consumer Electronics, it
has determined to alter the structure of ACE's activities with a view to
reducing its cost base i
nto line with its sales potential.
``Mr Rogers joined the board in August 1994 with a part of his brief to take
forward the business of ACE.
``In view of the decision taken by the board, Mr Rogers has indicated that he
wishes to step down from the board of Amstrad.''
Earlier this year, Mr Rogers promised ``a whole range of new products'' from
ACE in the near future, including fax machines, bubble-jet printers and a
pocket-size organiser.

LLOYDS TSB Group yesterday became the largest company registered in Scotland,
when the #15bn merger of its two constituent banks became effective.
Shares made a strong debut on the Stock Exchange, with brokers James Capel and
SG Strauss Turnbull taking ``buy'' stances.
The shares closed 4!sp above the notional Wednesday closing price of 339p set
by the London Stock Exchange, at 343!sp. More importantly, they were up 30!sp -
nearly 10% - on their ex-special dividend price of 313p. In an extremely quiet
London market, vol
ume was more than nine million shares.
John Tyce, banking analyst at SG Strauss Turnbull, believed the effective stock
split for Lloyds shareholders, who received 2.704 Lloyds TSB shares for each
Lloyds share previously held, was responsible for much of the strength of the
new shares.
He said: ``I think it (Lloyds TSB) is very strong for a variety of quite silly
reasons, like there is no business (in other stocks) and everybody loves a
share split.''
However, Mr Tyce sees benefits for the merged bank and is particularly
encouraged by Lloyds TSB's promise to cut annual costs by #350m by 1999.
The enlarged group's new registered office at TSB Bank Scotland's Edinburgh
headquarters was yesterday inaugurated by Gordon Anderson, the chairman of TSB
Bank Scotland who will sit on the board of Lloyds TSB.
Even though Lloyds TSB is now registered at Henry Duncan House in Edinburgh,
close to TSB's old registered office in Charlotte Square, Scotland accounts for
only 3300 of the enlarged group's nearly 90,000-strong workforce.
TSB envisages no net job losses in Scotland, where there is little duplication.
It also pledged not to axe any branches north of the Border next year, having
closed about 35 this year.
The enlarged group will be looking to reap benefits from the powerful
combination of TSB's extensive Scottish branch network and Lloyds' commercial
banking expertise, although it will no doubt be expecting a reaction from Bank
of Scotland, Royal Bank and
Clydesdale Bank.
A Lloyds TSB official said yesterday: ``We are aiming to be a very effective
competitor in Scotland, particularly in the commercial market.''
Emphasising the merged bank's focus on small and medium-sized Scottish
businesses, he added: ``I hope during 1996 we will be coming out with some
stuff which shows we are cutting the mustard in that market.''
Meanwhile, Lloyds TSB yesterday steered clear of rumours that it had made
approaches to potential purchasers of its Hill Samuel merchant banking
subsidiary.
It said it was ``far too early to say'' what its plans for Hill Samuel were.
Lloyds chairman Sir Robin Ibbs will chair the enlarged group, with TSB chairman
Sir Nicholas Goodison and Lloyds deputy chairman John Davies serving as his
deputies.
Sir Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds, has assumed the same role at the
helm of the enlarged bank. Lloyds chief financial officer Kent Atkinson also
retains his role in the merged operation.
A 68.3p special dividend will be paid to TSB shareholders only on January 18.

BARINGS, now part of the Dutch ING banking group, had a good year in terms of
corporate finance despite its well-publicised problems concerning Nick Leeson
and the subsequent collapse of the company and rescue by ING.
Baring Brothers has traditionally had a strong list of corporate clients and
managed to hold on to most of them amid its internal and external turmoil.
It topped the 1995 Acquisitions Monthly magazine's combined league table of
public and private transactions, ranked by deal value. Barings had 26 deals
worth an impressive #19.5bn. Eight of them, together worth #16.8bn, were public
takeovers.
Early in the year Baring Brothers was a co-adviser to Wellcome in its
high-profile #9100m takeover by rival drugs firm Glaxo - the largest
transaction of the year. Barings was also present on the second biggest deal,
advising Lloyds Bank in its #5900m tak
eover of the TSB Group.
It also advised on one of the few hostile utility bids so far, ScottishPower's
#1100m takeover of Manweb, the Chester-based regional electricity company.
There were 14 public bids over #1000m announced during 1995, compared with only
one in 1994. This was also ahead of the 1989 record when there were 11 such
deals.
Second in the corporate finance league table was Lazard Brothers with 30 deals
valued at #14.7bn. It advised Glaxo in its bid for Wellcome and is currently
working on two large deals: advising Granada in its #3100m hostile bid for
Forte, as well as acting
for National.&amp;.Provincial in its proposed #1300m takeover by Abbey National.
US banks did well in 1995 benefiting from the turmoil affecting several
domestic UK banks. Four of the major US banks, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan
Stanley and Lehman Brothers, were in the mergers and acquisitions (M.&amp;.A) top
20.
Acquisitions Monthly estimates that the City earned about #950m in fees from UK
takeovers in 1995. In 1989, the previous record year, this figure was estimated
at about #800m.
Philip Healey of Acquisitions Monthly believes that 1996 could be just as good
a year as 1995 for M.&amp;.A activity. The year will start with Granada still
battling to acquire the Forte hotels group.

MINUTES of the monthly monetary meeting held on November 1, 1995, between the
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and the Governor of the Bank of
England Eddie George show both agreeing that there was no justification for a
change in interest rates
.
But it is clear that the Governor still had doubts on inflation at that time,
though both men agreed on a quarter-point reduction at their next meeting on
December 13 - the minutes of which will be released on Wednesday, January 31.
At their November 1 meeting the Governor said that the data received since the
last meeting were uncomfortable - the cost and price figures were somewhat
stronger than would have been hoped, while the activity and survey data were
somewhat softer. Uncerta
inty about both future prices and activity had increased.
Listing some of the more positive and some less positive features of the cost
front, Mr George said it was possible to make caveats about all these numbers.
In particular, both input prices and retail prices were probably affected by
the unusually warm we
ather. But he said there was also some evidence of continuing attempts to pass
on cost increases and to rebuild margins at the retail level.
Overall, the Governor said that the main issue was whether the current
indications of weakness in the economy were temporary, or whether they were
likely to persist. The Bank's central projection remained that demand and
activity were likely to pick up in
to next year, but there were also downside risks.
For his part, the Chancellor said that most commentators expected the recovery
to remain on track. Consumer demand should pick up in due course, once the
impact of the earlier increases in taxes started to wear off. There was also
now less concern that in
terest rates would be raised significantly. The housing market was still weak,
although there were some tentative signs that it had bottomed out.
Mr Clarke considered that the behaviour of the labour market would be very
important for the future course of inflation. Falling unemployment did not
appear to have put upwards pressure on earnings, in part because of the labour
reforms the Government had
put in place.
On inflation, the Chancellor conceded it had picked up a little more than
expected in September, but this could be explained by the hot weather in the
summer. He continued to expect inflation to return to its downward path in the
near future. Producer pri
ce inflation was receding, particularly the growth in manufacturing output
prices, and commodity prices had also eased.
Mr Clarke said that ``the monetary data continued to give mixed and confusing
signals, which were difficult to interpret.''

<HEADLINE>Food team aims to build on European triumph and pursue new markets in North America and the Far East Scottish beef reaps export success</HEADLINE>

Breeding success ..... Alan Stevenson (left) and Dr Martin Grantley-Smith
checking on export quality at Low Boydston Farm, Ardrossan
SCOTLAND'S meat exporters can claim to be one of the success stories of the
1990s with a 162% increase in overseas sales in the past five years. That
growth has coincided with the formation of Scotmex - the Scottish meat export
initiative - which is spons
ored by Scottish Enterprise.
In 1989 meat exports were worth about #80m to Scotland. The most recent figures
show that sales of Scotch lamb alone now account for #94m and total meat
exports are worth #210m. The biggest contributor is beef, with sales of #108m.
At the other end of the
scale, pig meat comes in at #8m. Scottish food exports in 1994-95 totalled
#425m, an 11% increase on the previous year.
Dr Martin Grantley-Smith, chief executive of Scotmex, attributes the massive
growth in meat exports to two factors. He said: ``First of all, the
establishment of the single market led to greater access to European consumers.
``And the setting up of our own organisation and the efforts of the Scottish
Enterprise food team have greatly assisted Scottish meat producers in getting
into export markets all over Europe including advice and assistance with
exhibitions.''
Another factor has been the keen competition among supermarket groups which had
kept wholesale prices very low. That squeeze on margins had forced suppliers to
look to new markets and Scotland's reputation for quality produce had been a
major advantage in
penetrating export markets.
British beef didn't have a strong image in Europe but Scotch beef did have a
reputation for quality which had been built up over the years.
``In recent years we have seen a growing desire in restaurants across Europe to
stock the best ingredients and Scotch beef in particular is seen as the best -
along with our salmon and whisky,'' said Dr Grantley-Smith.
That perception has been encouraged by the setting up of the Scottish Beef
Club, which now has 600 restaurant members throughout Europe. In order to gain
membership restaurants must use Scotch beef and identify it as such on their
menus.
``The idea is that customers will enjoy their beef, notice that it is Scottish
beef and subsequently buy it themselves for home consumption,'' said Dr
Grantley-Smith. ``Beef has been our area of biggest growth - so it must be
working.''
Alan Stevenson, senior project executive with the Scottish Enterprise food
team, said: ``Scotland produces the best food in the world, but until fairly
recently we were not telling the rest of the world clearly enough that this was
the case.
``That is why we are now working hard to get the message across loud and clear
that Scottish meat is the best. We have met with a lot of success so far
through a programme of exhibitions, through our sponsorship of Scotmex and our
European Food Express sc
heme which works with companies wishing to get into export markets.''
The food team's aim now is to build on the European success and to pursue new
markets in North America and the Far East.

n IT'S hard to believe but the humble oatcake is ``hot'', humble only because
it's made with the simplest of ingredients: oatmeal, a small amount of fat,
baking soda, salt, and hot water; ``hot'' because suddenly the range and
variety of oatcakes availabl
e at your local supermarket has increased to such an extent that the shopper is
truly spoiled for choice.
There are little ones, big ones, finger shapes, triangles; thick ones, thin
ones, traditional and farmhouse; rough ones, fine ones, Highland ones and
English ones. Organic and bran, mixed herb and cheese, honey and - wait for it
- garlic!
The rising popularity of the oatcake can be attributed to a number of factors
including an increasing awareness of ``heritage'' foods which are not only
nutritionally sound but low in calories and price.
Manufacturers must be rubbing their hands in glee for, unlike scones and
pancakes, a decent looking oatcake is not easily produced at home owing,
according to the late F.Marian McNeill, ``to the stickiness of the dough and
the tendency of the edges to bre
ak''.
In her famous book The Scots Kitchen, first published in 1929, she writes that
oatcakes have been around for 1500 years.
Six hundred years ago the Scottish soldier always travelled with a plate which
could be heated in a fire and then spread with an oatmeal and water paste to
form a cake of sorts.
After Culloden (according to Ms McNeill who heard the tale from someone else)
an old woman who lived near the battlefield ``carried her table, her girdle,
and a quantity of oatmeal down to the roadside, lit a gipsy fire, and baked for
all she was worth; w
hen presently Charlie's men came by, speeding to the hills for safety, each
seized an oatcake from the pile''.
By comparison, the twentieth-century oatcake taste test that The Herald
conducted recently with a group of Glasgow's senior citizens, was a laid-back,
low-key affair.
Elizabeth, Agnes, Virginia, Mary, Isa, and Violet belong to a group which meets
once a week at Oakbank Primary School. All said they ate oatcakes from time to
time but not in any great quantity. One member said she recalled oatcakes being
served with stov
ies, which sounded an awfully dry combination. Violet was appalled at the
notion of putting anything sweet on an oatcake and reeled in horror at talk of
jam, marmalade, and honey. Marian McNeill certainly approved of marmalade,
however, and also stated th
at oatcakes were improved by being heated shortly before serving.
Our testers who had to make do with absolutely plain, stone-cold samples were
surprised at the variety of oatcakes on the market these days. They tasted
Nairn's Traditional, Paterson's Farmhouse, Stockans Thin Original, Wooleys of
Arran Original, Walkers
Cocktail plus Simmers cheese, and Stockan and Gardens Garlic. The prices ranged
from 20p per 75g packet to 87p for a 250g box.
The results showed that although one brand emerged as a clear favourite,
there's not much to be said about oatcakes.
Stockans thin original was thought by the majority to be too dry. The Nairn's
was nice and crispy, according to some, and too hard, according to others.
Everyone likes the Paterson's although the testers, apart from Mary, preferred
the bitesize Walkers co
cktail oatcakes which, according to the tartan box they came in, are very nice
with smoked salmon, caviar, and champagne.
Nobody had a good word to say about the thick Arran oatcakes (among my personal
favourites) which were described by some as being ``too coarse''.
Despite misgivings, everyone was pleasantly surprised by the Stockan and
Gardens garlic oatcakes apart from Mary who hates garlic and wouldn't eat one.
But of the two flavoured varieties the Simmers cheese oatcakes got the better
response.
Overall our testers preferred the Walkers cocktail oatcakes mainly because, due
to their softer texture and small size, they were easier to eat than the others.

Britain's pawnbrokers have polished up their shabby Dickensian image to become
successful players in the finance sector of the nineties, stealing middle-class
customers from banks and building societies. Beverley Lyons investigates
WHEN the rich were rich and the poor were poor, it used to be said that the
only place where you could borrow money was from the church or at the
pawnbrokers.
While it is argued that the former's stature may well have crumbled with
modernisation, the position of the latter is positively flourishing.
Within the past decade membership of the National Pawnbrokers' Association has
doubled and the UK organisation now has 140 members who are accountable for 230
shops. In Scotland, four new outlets have opened in the past year; and
longstanding establishmen
ts, including Glasgow's Robert Biggar Pawnbrokers (est. 1830), are being
refurbished.
Of course, pawnbroking has transformed itself since the days of dealing with
``divers persons of ill fame and repute who live in garrets, cellars and other
obscure places''. The three brass balls may still be there, serving as a
reminder of Florence's Med
ici family crest (originally featuring three blue discs) but nowadays they
represent a different form of the trade.
Historically known as the poor people's bank, the Dickensian image of the old
boy in fingerless mittens greeting you with an avaricious grin has disappeared
along with the ``wee wimmen from the steamie'' and the ``hackitt rag and bone
man''. In the nineti
es, pawners are likely to be greeted by a slick server in a smart suit who will
ask you to come into his office and sit on a Chesterfield.
The reason for this renewed interest in an industry as old as the olden days is
the emergence of our recession-based credit culture, claims Nathan Finch, a
spokesman for the National Pawnbrokers' Association. Finch explains: ``People
are not so reticent a
bout borrowing cash in the nineties, but the obstinacy of banks to extend
short-term overdrafts and credit limits has led them to look elsewhere.''
He says the processing fees which the banks and building societies charge can
often make a small loan a frightening prospect. ``Over the past five years
banks have been reticent about doling out the cash as they used to in the
eighties. If you're in a reg
ular job with a regular wage and have overextended yourself by the end of the
month, why should you be penalised for wanting an extra hundred quid to tide
you over?''
Isobel Lindsay, lecturer in sociology in the department of government at
Strathclyde University, is in no doubt that the credit-card boom of the late
eighties altered public perceptions towards borrowing money, an activity once
restricted to the ranks of
the poor and feckless.
Lindsay says: ``As long as you have high levels of insecure employment and a
growth in the number of short-term work contracts the problem of debt is one
which is unlikely to diminish. The changing balance of power in employment has
created a new kind of
credit customer whose expectations have been high in the past but who may be
experiencing hard times through redundancies.''
According to social observers, the ``newly insecure'' find it harder to cope
with irregular incomes and yet refuse to put their lives on hold and wait for
better days.
Lindsay adds: ``This middle-class group who need money to furnish their homes
and maintain their lives actually have possessions of some worth to pawn.''
This type of customer joins two traditional categories of client affected by
debt in Scotland - the ``permanently poor'' and ``social problem'' groups.
``Undoubtedly there has been a substantial extension of the `permanently poor'
over the past 15 years as a result of the economic decline, yet they have
little to pawn and their expectations are low,'' says Lindsay.
Traditionally, those who need to fuel their alcohol or gambling habits (namely
the ``social problem'' category) have been the pawnbroker's best customers.
However, while our propensity to gamble remains among the highest - Scots spend
more per capita on t
he National Lottery than the rest of our UK counterparts - it is evident that
the birth of the ``newly insecure'' implies a different attitude towards
borrowing. One of the most obvious changes has been the type of item which is
now being traded to the pa
wnbrokers.
Times have changed since the days when clothes were accepted as part of the
pawning, when wives used to queue at the pawnbroker's door on a Friday evening
to retrieve the brown paper bags carrying their husbands' suits.
``Nowadays it's cars, deeds for houses, and even share certificates which
qualify as capital,'' says Edward Fox, owner of Robert Biggar Pawnbrokers, who
has been offered everything ``from Rolls-Royces down''.
The kind of people Fox caters for are just as likely to come from Newton Mearns
or Bearsden as housing estates in the city. Why they should go to a pawnshop
rather than a building society or bank remains a subject of debate. It is clear
that the pawnshop
is a feasible short-term option when it comes to cash in your hand or a secure
place to leave your belongings when you go on holiday.
Alan Scott, secretary of the Committee of Scottish Clearing Banks, recognises
the appeal of pawnbrokers. He says: ``In some respects they are providing a
service in a niche market - for particular people in particular
circumstances.'' Such as when you don
't want to explain to the bank manager that you need #30 for putting a quick
bet on the dead cert on the 3.10 at Newbury.
However, Scott is keen to point out that the services which banks and
pawnbrokers offer should not be equated. ``It's like comparing apples with
coconuts in that bank loans are unsecured whereas pawnshops require security
before they pay out.''
Scott agrees that today's financial client has more options than ever and that
attitudes towards moneylenders have changed. ``It used to be said that the
cloth-capped worker went to the pawnbroker and the bowler-hatted chap entered
the bank. Thankfully th
e stereotypes have now changed and nobody has to fit any preconception to get a
loan.''
Kings and countrymen, whatever their faith, are welcome to take a pledge.

n IT'S an ill wind . . . and the sub-Moscow blast afflicting Scotland is good
news alike for gas and electricity companies and the house dust mite.
Turning up the central heating a few notches and draught-proofing doors in
double-glazed homes creates a haven for the thousands of unseen guests, whose
microscopic droppings are blamed for triggering asthma, eczema and other
complaints.
How to maintain a comfortable, yet allergen-free, environment is the challenge
boffins at ADM Indux claim to have met - with an air-brick size unit that

n SINCE a student who disturbed rail passengers by playing loud pop music was
fined #300, trains seem to have become somewhat quieter.
But what happens if it's the driver of your coach who's responsible for the
din, by relaying a commercial radio station over the audio system?
Don't gurn and bear it is the advice of Scottish Citylink, some of whose
passengers were subjected to such an ordeal between Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Drivers have been given orders not to inflict their personal preferences in
music on others, said Citylink after Check-Out complained on behalf of a
customer. That's good news for the increasing number of commuters who welcome
the company's fare deals but
don't want to be force-fed Bjork and the Beatles, hear testimonials to turkey

LIZ TAYLOR discovers what happens when the chips are down for the middle
classes and there's no hope of redemption
WHEN I was a junior reporter a long time ago there was a crisis in the office
after it was discovered there were not enough typewriters to go round.
First one vanished, then another, to be followed by a third and a fourth.
Eventually it was discovered that another reporter was pawning them, and our
forgiving editor sent someone round to the local pawnshop to redeem the tools
of our trade.
This memory came back when I saw a sale of unredeemed pawnbrokers' pledges was
to be held at Christie's, South Kensington.
A bored-sounding gentleman in Christie's jewellery department told me the
saleroom held four such sales a year and the majority of the lots were
jewellery or watches. It doesn't accept anything for sale that is valued at
less than #25. ``We get a lot of R
olexes and occasionally things like Cartier rings, but few surprises,'' he said.
Wondering what happens to more humble unredeemed pledges - typewriters for
example - I contacted the National Pawnbrokers' Association. Spokesman Harvey
Bell-Roberts said that when something was pawned, the broker lent money against
its value and could ke
ep it for six months if it was not claimed. Then 14 days' notice of intention
to sell the pledge had to be sent to the original owner. If it was still not
claimed the pawnbroker could sell the goods at auction, by tender, or by
private treaty.
If the sum raised by the sale was more than the original pledge, efforts had to
be made to return the balance to the person who pledged the goods originally.
If that person was untraceable, the pawnbroker could not claim the surplus
money for six years.
It is rare for a customer to vanish, he said, because most people who availed
themselves of pawnbrokers' services today were repeat customers, and usually
affluent middle class. Gone are the days of Charles Dickens when poor families
hocked their boots or
their blankets to get through the week. That sort of poverty is generally
taken care of by the social services now and today's pawnbroker lends money on
expensive golf clubs, good watches, or diamond rings.
Sometimes people try hocking their cars or the deeds of their houses. Every
pawnbroker has stories of the sort of things well-off customers attempt to
pledge in return for money to take expensive holidays, satisfy the mortgage
company, or pay the fees for
private schools. When the crisis is past and the cash flow has recovered, they
return and redeem their goods.
If pawnbrokers are suspicious about a customer and have doubts about how the
goods being offered have been obtained, they ask for receipts and can refuse to
take the suspect item.
Bell-Roberts said that for several years, because prices raised in auction
sales had tended to be low, pawnbrokers had not been sending much to the big
auction houses. Recently, however, things had improved and they were now using
auction sales again. Som
etimes items, particularly jewellery, were entered for sales as single lots,
but usually pawnbrokers used a saleroom in their own locality for shifting
unredeemed stock in bulk.
At the Glasgow Pawnbroking Company in Bath Street, Archie Crocket, who is an
NPA council member representing Scotland, said his company used Arthur Collins
saleroom at 114 Trongate to dispose of unredeemed pledges. Collins holds
pawnbrokers' auctions thre
e days a week, with goods being entered from all over Scotland. They sell
everything from television sets to silver and paintings and another two days,
Tuesdays and Thursdays, are set aside for selling jewellery.
Mr Crocket said about 7% of all pledges taken in his establishment were
unredeemed. People tried to pawn such disparate objects as their false teeth,
driving licences, and guitars. The oddest pledge he has accepted was a gipsy's
crystal ball, complete wit
h a book of instructions. The person who brought it in claimed it back within
the six months.
Another pawnbroker, Edward Fox, who has premises in Edinburgh and Glasgow, said
that 10% of his pledges ended up unredeemed. In the past he had been offered
such things as a skeleton from a medical student and a Lamborghini car (which
he did not accept);
gold discs by a failing pop star (which he did accept); and souvenirs of a
glorious past by a descendant of the Russian royal family who brought in
imperial cuff links, a red ceremonial sash, and some icons. They were not
redeemed but Mr Fox has kept them
, more for sentimental reasons than anything else. He thinks the Russian might
come back for them one day.

THE Stock Exchange faces a critical year in 1996 which could see a radical
change in the way shares are traded in the UK.
To start with the exchange will be reminded of its humiliating failure to
develop a modern electronic settlement system as Crest gets under way. The task
was taken away from it following the failure of its own Taurus development and
given to the Bank of E
ngland.
Crest has proceeded on schedule and to cost to the extent where detailed trials
involving all users will start shortly and it is due to be fully operational on
July 15.
Then the exchange will have a battle on its hands in trying to reconcile the
conflicting demands of the institutions which provide its members with their
business and the market-makers which provide the dealing system.
Institutions want to cut out the middleman and deal directly with each other by
using an order-driven trading system where buyers and sellers are matched
electronically, the system used in newer exchanges in other countries. This
contrasts with the tradit
ional quote-driven system where market-makers post the prices at which they are
prepared to buy and sell on an electronic bulletin board.
For once the exchange has sided with the modernisers and its own order-driven
system is due to begin in August. Market-makers fear they will be gradually
squeezed out and are fighting against change. This is hardly surprising since
their very existence is
under threat and with it an important part of the culture of the City of
London.
In reality the exchange has little choice if it is to avoid being outflanked by
rival share-dealing systems. An independent order-driven operation run by
Tradepoint is already in existence and others are likely, including attempts by
European markets to m
uscle in on London's business.
If the City is to retain its pre-eminence the exchange has to change with the
times in a more positive and committed way than it has in the past.
New route
ROYAL Insurance's expansion in southern Europe is the latest example of the
increasing internationalisation of the insurance market. This mirrors trends
seen in other financial services.
The impetus for these changes is coming from both the demand and supply side of
the industry, and are being made possible by the lowering of international
trade barriers in insurance and developments in information technology.
Within Europe the EC Insurance Directives, starting with the Reinsurance
Directive of 1964, have created for all classes of life and general insurance a
single market embracing all European Union (EU) and European Economic Area
(EEA) member states.
Since July 1994, an insurer authorised in any member state has been free to
enter into direct insurance contracts with a resident of any other member
state, this is subject to transitional arrangements for a few countries.
The UK motor account faces a particularly tough time with intense competition
from direct writers. These include the Royal Bank of Scotland's market-leading
Direct Line with over two million accounts representing over 12% of the market.
Therefore motor in
surance is a natural choice for the traditional composite insurers looking to
expand overseas. In 1995, private motor is expected to have accounted for
between 4% and 9% of worldwide general premiums.
The fact that there is so much competition in the domestic motor insurance
market with over 20 direct writers, means that insurance premium rates are
likely to remain soft as companies seek to increase their market share.
The prospect of this difficult trading background continuing for some time has
prompted Merrill Lynch to confirm its long-term underweight recommendation on
the sector.
Royal Insurance in particular, along with Sun Alliance, is thought to be
vulnerable to a cyclical downturn in the UK and structural change in the market.
Rule bending
MOVES by Carlton Television and Granada Television to get around their
excessive shareholdings in ITN - the news supplier to the independent networks
- look suspiciously like an attempt to bounce the Independent Television
Commission into accepting arrang
ements which fall short of complying with the rules.
The problem arose when the two companies took over Central and LWT
respectively. This resulted in them both doubling their holding in ITN to 36%
when the 1990 Broadcasting Act laid down a maximum holding by any one
shareholder of 20%.
The companies were given to the end of 1995 to reduce their holdings pending a
review by the Government of various ownership issues. The 20% limit was upheld
and the ITC expected them to comply by the end of the year.
Then at the end of November they came up with a scheme whereby the excess
holding would be parked into a separate entity where Carlton and Granada would
not be able to exercise the extra votes.
After taking legal advice, the ITC has now ruled that technically this would
not breach the provisions of the Act. But it does say it goes against the
spirit of the ownership rules and regrets the way the companies have
interpreted the Act. Furthermore it
will press for ``avoidance mechanisms'' to be dealt with in new broadcasting
legislation.
Carlton and Granada will no doubt argue that they can find no takers for the
shares, particularly given the way the television companies are trying to
negotiate better deals with ITN. However, they have had a whole extra year to
dispose of the excess shar
es and there must surely have been a price at which they could have been sold.
The whole episode is yet another example of the way in which the broadcasters
are constantly pushing against the rules which are rightly designed to prevent
market dominance.

Land Rover drives
to new record
THE Land Rover company built a record number of 127,287 vehicles in 1995, 35%
more than the previous record set last year, it was announced yesterday.
Production of the utility Defender range rose from 22,234 to 27,670, while
nearly 70,000 Discovery vehicles were built, compared with 54,424 last year.
The company, based at Solihull in the West Midlands, said weekly production had
risen from 2600 in January to more than 3000 by the end of the year. A further
1200 employees had been taken on this year taking the total to 11,900.
Meanwhile, with just a few days to go, total UK new car sales for 1995 are
expected to finish at around the 1,920,000 mark achieved in 1994.
The last official published figures showed sales for the first 11 months
totalling 1,873,826 - a 1.97% increase on the comparable 1994 total.
Property purchase
PEMBERSTONE is buying the first, second and third Roman property trusts for a
total of #11.7m. They own residential property let predominantly on assured
tenancy and assured short-hold tenancies for the purpose of sheltered housing.
Tamaris trio
TAMARIS has entered into operating leases in respect of three new,
purpose-built nursing homes, bringing the total number of homes under its
management to 15.
Lockout over
TATE &amp; Lyle's US subsidiary AE Staley announced that union members had voted to
accept the company's latest contract proposal, bringing to an end the 30-month
lockout of union employees at its Decatur plant.
Car scheme
BARR &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust has disposed of its VAG business in Leeds to a
subsidiary of Sytner Group for #1.4m. Part of the site is being let to Sytner

REPORT
THE annual rate of business failures in the UK in 1995 fell by 5.3% to 41,303
from 43,598 in 1994, according to business information service Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, writes CHRIS STONE.
The drop is considered disappointingly small when compared with the 16.3%
recorded between 1994 and 1993. In Scotland the number of companies going to
the wall actually increased by 22.4%, but the bankruptcy law differs from the
rest of the UK and so no d
irect comparisons can be made.
A breakdown of the Scottish figures shows that at 3388, bankruptcies increased
by 22.8%, while liquidations were up 19.8% at 704, still the biggest percentage
increase apart from London. Overall, business failures in Scotland accounted
for 9.9% of the UK
total.
For all of Britain there was a 4.6% increase in larger company liquidations
(from 16,335 to 17,280), the first rise for three years. More than 6000 larger
companies in London were liquidated compared to 4700 in 1994, an increase of
28%. This upsurge was l
argely compensated for by a 20% decrease in smaller business bankruptcies. But,
overall, business failures in London grew by 14%.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet's senior analyst Philip Mellor points to ``worrying signs'' in
the figures that liquidations are rising again in Scotland and the North of
England as well as in London. He says that in the past nine months there has
been a rise in company
liquidations in London which has spread to other parts of the UK.
It remains to be seen what impact this will have on smaller companies.
Wales emerges as the area with the biggest decrease in business failures.
During the year they dropped by 19% and there were also big falls in South-west
England (18.5%) and South-east England (16.6%).

NATURE gives little warning of the tragedies which unfold before our
disbelieving eyes. Yet, in the course of that Rangers-Celtic match at Ibrox
Park on the fateful day 25 years ago, I did experience a strange shiver which I
was later to put down to premo
nition.
No hint of it could be found, however, as the 80,000 people streamed towards
the Rangers ground on what I described at the time as ``a fine afternoon of
winter-red sun, always threatened by the haze which would eventually close in
around four o'clock.''
What else would happen before the twilight hour was still in the lap of the
gods.
I had made my way to Ibrox that day, partly in the hope of seeing a good
football match (neutrals actually did such things in bygone days) and partly
with the vested interest of an Aberdeen supporter, whose team was then at the
top of the league.
As reigning Scottish Cup holders, the Dons were being hotly pursued in the
league by the reigning champions, Celtic, then in the midstream of their
phenomenal run under the great Jock Stein.
Rangers' championship hopes that year were pretty remote but, as always, a
victory over Celtic would make the perfect start to 1971.
Without a ticket for the all-ticket match, I knew I had to get there early if I
were to pick up a spare. Parking the car half-a-mile away, I walked briskly
towards the red-bricked facade of Ibrox, arriving just after two o'clock.
For an occasion which was hailed in the official programme that day as ``the
greatest club game in the world'', I remember being surprised by an incredible
hush for that time of the afternoon.
Belatedly, however, the atmosphere did build up, generating that pre-match
electricity as players and well-known personalities rolled in for the game,
exchanging New Year greetings and craning necks in search of friends who had
tickets to collect.
I looked for the spare voucher and landed lucky at 2.45pm. Someone's friend had
not turned up and he could sell his ticket - for what was to become the
disaster end of the terracing, adjacent to Copland Road. Gate 13.
I paid him the six shillings (30p today) and hurried towards the fatal
passageway. But the gods were on my side.
Halfway there, I bumped into fellow-journalist Bill Aitken, who was duty
reporter for the Sunday Express that day, poised for any news stories which may
arise. Bill must have been the only man around Ibrox with a spare grandstand
ticket.
I gladly accepted it and soon found a willing buyer for my terracing ticket.
The man was delighted. I shall never know if I sold him a ticket to tragedy.
As I took my place at the right-hand end of the main stand, I was looking
directly across towards the corner of the terracing where I might have been. It
was in that traditionally Rangers end of the ground that death would soon run
riot.
For the moment, however, this ``greatest club game in the world'' was simply a
desperate struggle for pride as well as points. It was one of the best-behaved
Old Firm crowds I could remember, except for one particularly nasty chant which
stuck in my mind
for ever after.
In the fading light of half-time, the floodlights came filtering through in a
blue and ghostly shimmer. It was then I had one of those strange feelings. A
premonition? A journalist's hunch?
I was there as a paying spectator but journalists are a bit like policemen -
once a journalist, always a journalist. I remember consciously asking myself
if, in the event of something happening here today, I had taken in enough of
the atmosphere to write
about it.
So I quietly absorbed the vibrations of the scene around me. As the game neared
its end, Celtic were leading 1-0 and that seemed like the final score. I
decided to leave shortly before the end and was outside the ground just in time
to hear the almighty r
oar which almost certainly meant one thing only - Rangers had equalised with
the last kick of the match.
The mist which had dimmed the glorious horizon and lost us the crescent moon
also magnified that roar of ecstasy.
It was the moment when disaster struck. Rangers fans already descending
Stairway 13 turned back, seeking to glimpse their unexpected moment of triumph.
In the cross-currents of congestion, the crowd collapsed like a pack of cards.
In those circumstances, death comes quietly, so much so that most people were
home by their television sets before they knew anything had happened.
That the tragedy of Ibrox had claimed 66 lives in the arena where we had spent
the previous two hours - and that we had managed to walk away from it in total
ignorance - was a bewilderment which stunned us into silence.
At 4.40 that afternoon, the world had still seemed a place for the exuberance
of life. It took only seconds for the hush and the horror of death to descend.

THE brother of Mr John Buchanan, a father-of-three killed on Stairway 13, told
this week of the long-term effects his brother's death has had on the family,
Iain Wilson writes.
Mr Billy Buchanan was 21 when his brother John, then 31, was killed. He said:
``I do not think my mother has ever recovered from what happened that day.''
Of his own feelings, he said: ``I am fine.'' However, he said this time of year
was a particularly emotional one for his family, whose thoughts were with John.
The brothers had attended the game separately, mixing with their own friends.
Billy, who was on Stairway 12, left 10 minutes before the end.
``At the time, I was living in Springburn,'' Billy said. ``I left before
Rangers scored. I did not know anything had happened until I was at home and my
wife said she had heard something on television.
``I went round to my parents' house. We were told later that John was involved.
It is something I do not like talking about. I stayed with my parents all that
night, then visited his wife and children the next day.''
Mr Buchanan, a plater now living in Cumbernauld, said he had lost contact with
his late brother's children.
He welcomed Rangers' recently announced plan for a memorial to the victims.

TRAGEDY brushed Donald McInnes and the hundreds like him who left Ibrox
minutes, even seconds, before the fateful goal that led to death. Like many
others, he still wonders what would have happened to him had he stayed on.
The 19-year-old's home was just a five-minute walk from the stadium. It was
from there that he first heard the sirens.
A sixth sense told him that something dreadful was happening, perhaps a fire.
Thoughts then turned to the friends he had left behind on Stairway 13. Such
were the times, he thought that running, pitched battles had erupted in and
around the stadium.
Mr McInness left his McLellan Street flat and headed back to the ground where,
unknown to him, a colleague from the Rolls-Royce plant at Hillington lay dead.
He said: ``They always opened the gates 15 minutes from the end. With three
minutes to go, I remember saying goodbye to my friends and leaving with others
to escape Celtic's celebrations at the final whistle.
``I was about 100 yards away, walking down Edmiston Drive, when I heard a roar
and thought the game was over. At home, I heard on TV that Rangers had
equalised. There was no mention of a disaster.
``Then I heard the sirens. They were everywhere, coming from every direction.
``I walked back to Ibrox. People were milling about but no-one knew anything
about what was happening. That's my abiding memory - hundreds of people not
knowing what was going on.
``At Harrison Drive, I was stopped, pushed back by supporters who were coming
out the gates. They kept saying, `Don't go back, don't go in there.' At the
same time, the police were trying to get in.
``I remember it was black. There were no cordons. I remember the police,
running, in their black coats, and ambulancemen with their little haversacks
and dark suits.
``Then came the snippets; there had been an accident. No-one spoke of a
disaster. I tried to get in to find my pals. I had to find them, that was my
main concern. But I couldn't get in.''
He waited what seemed an eternity, like many others standing on garden walls in
Harrison Drive, hoping to catch a glimpse of his friends. Back home, a
broadcast spoke of deaths and, hours later, he finally tracked down his
friends. It wasn't until the nex
t day that the scale of the disaster became known.
Mr McInness, of Mosspark Drive, Glasgow, is now 44, is married with two
children aged 15 and 11, and is still with Rolls-Royce, as a turner.
He said of the disaster: ``I try not to dwell on it, but even now I sometimes
think `what if I'd stayed on?' I just put it down to luck that I didn't.''

<HEADLINE>Bradford, Heysel, and the horrific lesson of Hillsborough</HEADLINE>

THREE more recent football stadium disasters, probably etched indelibly in the
memories of all sports fans, were at the City Ground in Bradford, the Heysel
Stadium in Brussels, and Hillsborough in Sheffield.
The omnipresence of television cameras at major sporting events has ensured
that thoughts of each one conjure up vivid and horrific images - of people
fleeing a massive wooden stand ablaze at Bradford, of mindless fans rioting on
the terraces of the Heyse
l Stadium and of the contorted faces of supporters being squashed and
suffocated against a perimeter fence at Hillsborough.
The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade ground on May 11, 1985, resulted in
the deaths of 56 people.
A judicial inquiry chaired by Mr Justice Popplewell heard that it was almost
certainly started by a lighted cigarette dropped accidentally through a gap
underneath the seating in part of the main stand, where debris had collected
for at least 17 years.
The fire spread with devastating speed to engulf the wooden stand - built in
1909 - where about 4000 people had been among a crowd watching a match between
Bradford City and Lincoln City.
The Bradford football fire inquest returned verdicts of death by misadventure
in July 1985 on all 56 victims of the tragedy and agreed with the interim
Popplewell report that the cause was a dropped cigarette end, cigar butt or
lighted match.
Tough measures to enforce safety standards at sports grounds - including the
requirement of safety certificates to be issued by local authorities for stands
accommodating more than 500 people - came into operation at the beginning of
1989 as part of Gover
nment action taken in the wake of the Bradford fire.
Just 18 days after the fire, 38 people were killed and 454 were injured in the
Heysel Stadium disaster in Brussels on May 29, 1985, when rioting erupted
before the European Cup final between Liverpool and the Italian champions,
Juventus.
The tragedy, which came as violence in English football had started to
escalate, occurred when two sets of rival fans found themselves beside each
other on the terraces at the north end of the stadium.
Accounts varied of what happened but bottles and lumps of concrete started to
fly, mainly from Liverpool fans, an hour before the match was due to start.
As the Juventus fans fled the hail of projectiles, the wall of one section of
the terrace collapsed and the English fans later broke down and moved across a
fence, charging at the Italian fans.
The Italian section in front of the charging English cascaded down the terrace,
like ``a swirling river of bodies'', according to one witness, and scores of
people were crushed to death.
In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, few people had any doubt that the
Liverpool fans were to blame but inadequate ticket allocation was also cited as
a factor.
In addition, blame was apportioned to the state of the stadium. A report by the
Institution of Civil Engineers said the 38 people would not have died had the
``crumbling and decrepit stadium been kept in a state of decent repair''.
The report also said the local authority-owned stadium broke all European
safety rules and ignored the lessons of Ibrox Park, where 66 people died in
``very similar circumstances'' in 1971.
It said that many people would have survived if the 55-year-old crush barriers
at Heysel had been replaced.
The Belgian Government issued safety guidelines for sports grounds one year
after the riots. It called for immediate action to improve the construction of
stadiums, to segregate rival supporters, and to better co-ordinate police
forces.
UEFA, European football's governing body, quickly took punitive action against
English football teams in the wake of the disaster, imposing an unprecedented
ban from European competition.
Britain's worst sporting tragedy occured at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough
ground on April 15, 1989, when 95 people died at an FA Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
Many of the victims were crushed against fencing in the Leppings Lane end of
the stadium - which had been reserved for Liverpool fans - as latecomers surged
in from the back.
The death toll rose to 96 four years after the tragedy, in March 1993, when
Tony Bland, a 22-year-old Liverpool fan, died in hospital after his parents won
a court ruling allowing life-support systems to be switched off.
Lord Justice Taylor, who chaired a wide-ranging investigation into the tragedy,
said the immediate cause of the disaster was the failure to cut off access to
the already overfull central pens at the Leppings Lane end of the ground when
police opened an em
ergency exit to relieve the crush outside.
In a damning indictment, he also criticised South Yorkshire police and the
Sheffield Wednesday club and said no attempt was made to steer away from the
crowded pens the fans pouring into the stadium, no safe maximum capacities had
been laid down, and ther
e was no effective monitoring of crowd density.
Barriers in the pens were inadequate, with one collapsing, and a ``lack of
vigilant monitoring caused a sluggish reaction and response when the crush
occurred''.
The Taylor report, published in January 1990, also pointed to old grounds, poor
facilities, the ``scourge'' of hooliganism, and ``poor leadership'' as features
which ``disfigured'' football.
It said ``vision and imagination'' was required to achieve what Lord Justice
Taylor called a new ethos for the sport.
His main recommendation to improve safety and combat hooliganism was the
introduction of all-seater stadiums at every football league ground.
Lord Justice Taylor said there was no panacea to achieve total safety and cure
behaviour problems at football matches but added that he was satisfied that
``seating does more to achieve those objectives than any other single
measure''.

WITH just over five minutes of the game remaining, my two friends and I decided
that we had had enough. Rangers were not going to score if they played all day.
Losing to Celtic was a bad way to start the year but at least it was only
one-nil.
We trudged rather than walked back to the car and, as we drove off towards
Dundee, we did not even bother to switch on the radio. Silence and grief always
seem appropriate companions.
Eventually, the sense of solitude got to me and I turned on the news. To our
communal delight, the gloom was instantly lifted. Somehow Colin Stein had
managed to equalise. The game had ended in a draw.
The euphoria was short-lived. I had to tell my two companions to be quiet.
There was more news from Ibrox - the like of which I had never heard before and
hope never to hear again.
There had been some kind of major accident at the stadium. People were dead.
Throughout the whole journey home, there were constant bulletins, each bringing
graver news. The death toll steadily rose. I can still remember the
overwhelming sense of shock an
d disbelief. After all, it was only a game. None of us could think of anything
worthy of saying. At times silence and grief are necessary companions.
It was January 2, 1971, and by five minutes I had failed to witness the Ibrox
Disaster and the death of 66 of my fellow Rangers supporters.
The next day revealed that, after the equaliser, some of the crowd leaving by
stairway 13 had turned and tried to return to the ground. In the resultant
crush, people tripped and fell, barriers collapsed, and the tragedy gathered
its own momentum. I will
always remember the horrific but deeply moving photographs of the dead lying in
a row beside the pitch. It could not be true, but it was.
Rangers were represented at the funerals of all those who died.
However, this sharing of grief was not enough. The Rangers board knew that such
an event must never be allowed to happen again. Football had to leave the dark
ages which were taken for granted by so many in the game. Ibrox was to be
changed once and for a
ll. The old terraces would go and be replaced by a modern, safe, all-seated
stadium.
The main driving force was the late Willie Waddell, who travelled Europe in
search of a model for the new Ibrox. When he visited the Westfalionstadion in
Dortmund, he found his inspiration and so the work of reconstruction began.
When I joined the Rangers
board, I was privileged to get to know ``The Deedle''. A man of great strength
of character and kindness, his love of football, but more particularly Rangers
FC, made a lasting impression on me.
The prospect of a seated stadium nowadays does not in any way seem unusual.
Indeed, it is the norm. Yet all these years ago it was an innovation of
staggering proportions. This was long before the events at Bradford and
Hillsborough and the Taylor Report
which introduced compulsory new safety standards - and seats. Rangers found
their plans being met with opposition and ridicule.
Supporters did not want to sit at matches. You could provide seats but no-one
would use them. People liked being out in the wind and rain. Rangers persisted
and gradually the new stadium emerged and grew into the magnificent venue it
now is. Not that it w
as easy.
Rangers found, as many have since, that the cost of building a ground and
having a successful team can be mutually exclusive. After completion of one of
the phases, I remember that one of the jokes doing the rounds was that the club
was to sue the archite
cts as they had built the stand facing the pitch. There was a fire at Ibrox and
when the cry of ``Save the Cups'' went up, everyone ran to the canteen.
The vision of Waddell and his colleagues went beyond simply providing a safe
environment. It was about treating people with respect and in a civilised
manner - providing a degree of comfort and cover from the weather, food that
was edible, and toilets tha
t did not cause offence. The image of supporters standing in the pouring rain,
munching on a soggy pie, drinking cold Bovril, and running the risk of being
urinated upon, seems virtually barbaric. Yet, not so long ago, that was
Scottish football.
Other events brought dramatic changes to our national game.
The Scottish Cup Final of 1980 between Rangers and Celtic ended with a riot on
the pitch (involving the supporters, it must be stressed) and police horses
charging the rival factions. Drunkenness was blamed and this led to the
Criminal Justice (Scotland)
Act 1980, banning alcohol from grounds and making it an offence to attempt to
get into a football match while under the influence of drink.
Football had indeed changed - irrevocably - but for the better. Rangers had led
the way and yet the real tragedy is that many more lives had to be lost south
of the Border before others would follow that lead. Would they have done so but
for the Taylor Re
port? Eventually, I suspect, but clubs and administrators were far too
complacent. The notion that football supporters would turn up in vast numbers
and tolerate whatever conditions were provided for them, was clung on to by
many. Safety was taken too muc
h for granted. Comfort was expensive to provide.
Twenty-five years on, those who paid such a price on that awful day would not
recognise the place where they died nor the game which cost them their lives.
Modern stadiums are safe, comfortable, civilised places. Supporters, too, have
changed. The old loy
alties, the choruses and songs may still be there, but the vast majority of
fans are intolerant of trouble, drunkenness, racist chants, and the like. Treat
people like pigs and they will behave as such. Treat them with respect and they
will react accordin
gly.
The ceremony of the Loving Cup is performed at Ibrox at the first home game of
every new year. The directors of Rangers and the visiting team gather in the
Blue Room and drink the health of the reigning sovereign in memory of the men
who died in a disaste
r at Holditch Colliery in the Potteries. After that tragedy, Rangers played a
friendly against Stoke City to raise money for their families. The president of
Stoke presented the cup to the Ibrox club. In recent years, it has become the
tradition to rememb
er those who died that January day.
Twenty-five years has for me passed very quickly. Not so, I suspect, those left
behind with the memory of their loved ones leaving for a football match, never
to return. Their memory is always with those of us who love this club of which
I am but an insig
nificant party. I hope they will think it fitting that the magnificent Ibrox
Stadium started by Willie Waddell and his colleagues, and soon to be completed
by my friend and chairman, David Murray, stands as a permanent memorial to them.

`Three seconds
to live' under
pile of bodies
JIM Harris was told by doctors he would have been dead in another three seconds
and that the haemorrhaging he suffered was seen only in corpses.
The 18-year-old apprentice mechanic spent more than an hour trapped, crushed,
and suffocating between the dead bodies below and people piled six high above
him.
Injuries included a fractured pelvis, crushed ribs, fractures to both legs, a
dislocated ankle, and haemorrhaging from his eyes and ears.
However, the teenager felt no pain and, soon after his arrival at the Southern
General Hospital, he walked out. Hours later, he turned up at his home in
Lenzie, with no idea of how he had got there.
Today, Mr Harris is a 43-year-old fireman, married with three children. He is
appreciative of life and has put the disaster in perspective, although he often
thinks of a friend, just 16, who did not survive.
Mr Harris, now of Muirside Avenue, Kirkintilloch, had gone to the match after
winning two tickets in a supporters' club ballot.
He had tried to leave early and had reached the top of Stairway 13, overlooking
the exit, when there was a roar for the Rangers' equaliser.
There was a tremendous crush as people in front of him tried to return to the
terracing. Unbearable pressure followed, then people began to fall.
He was swept downwards, halted only by a wall of bodies.
Others fell on top of him and he lost consciousness - but not before a
near-death experience: ``They talk about life flashing in front of you. It is
true. It was like a quick re-run of a movie,'' he said.
When he came to, his arms were pinned and breathing was near impossible but he
heard a policeman say: ``This one's still alive.''
To this day, Mr Harris has nurtured an ambition to meet the sergeant who
battled for more than an hour to save his life. The unidentified officer, after
grabbing his hair and trying to pull him clear, ensured he would not suffocate
by pulling countless bo
dies away.
He cannot explain why he wandered away from hospital and only recalls turning
up at his home, which was filled with worried relatives, at about 11pm.
``My father was out at the coal bunker when I appeared like an apparition,
looking like someone out of a Dracula movie. There was blood coming from my
eyes and ears.
``A GP was called and he was horrified. He took one look, and my pulse, before
sending me to Stobhill Hospital, where I spent about eight weeks.
Mr Harris said he had seen some horrific sights as a fireman but nothing that
compared with the scale of the Ibrox tragedy.

THE jury at the fatal accident inquiry produced a probable cause for the 66
deaths, Iain Wilson writes.
They warned that more deaths or injuries could be expected on the stairway if
it was left in its present form and a closely packed crowd of people was
allowed to descend.
That finding, after a seven-day inquiry held in Glasgow in February, 1971, was
the nearest the jury came to accepting a recommendation by counsel for
relatives of the deceased that blame for the disaster should be placed on the
Rangers board.
Mr Charles Macarthur QC suggested that the Rangers directors had been engaged
in a game of ``pass the parcel'' after three accidents on the same stairway.
In his closing speech, Mr Macarthur told the jury of four men and three women
that some of the blame must lie at the door of Rangers because no-one seemed to
have done anything about suggestions made about the stairway after an accident
in 1969, the third
in eight years.
Mr W R Grieve QC, representing Rangers, said the club had no desire to shirk
responsibilities regarding provision for spectators at Ibrox. He said directors
were determined that there would not be a repeat of the accident.
He urged the jury to consider the evidence in its proper perspective. It did
not require much imagination to find the effective cause of the disaster.
Someone must have fallen.
Sir Allan Walker QC, the sheriff who presided at the inquiry, told the jury he
did not feel they should make any reference to fault or negligence in their
verdict. However, they might feel they had a duty to prevent such a tragedy
happening again.
The jury recommended that a reduction of numbers using the stairway was a
matter of expert advice. They added that similar advice should be sought on
methods of exit from all football grounds.
They found the accident probably occurred because one or more persons fell or
collapsed on the stairway when those descending were packed closely together -
and were being pushed downwards by the pressure of those above and behind them.
That downward pressure forced others to fall or collapse on to those who had
fallen first. As the pressure continued, more and more people were heaped upon
those who had fallen.

THE Scottish sports media was about to hail events at Ibrox on January 2, 1971,
as one of the most sporting Old Firm matches, both on and off the field, for
years. Only two arrests - both for drunkenness - were recorded from a crowd of
80,000 and the matc
h itself, handled well by referee Bill Anderson, was almost incident free.
The game, which had been played in a good spirit on a bone-hard pitch, was
heading for a no-scoring draw but, with a minute left, a Bobby Lennox shot came
off the bar and little Jimmy Johnstone was first to react, heading the ball
home to give Celtic the
lead.
Thousands of Rangers fans, thinking that the game was lost, began heading for
the exits but, with just 15 seconds remaining, Rangers were awarded a free kick
for a foul by Celtic full-back Jim Craig. Dave Smith sent the ball into the
penalty area and, as
it bobbed about, Colin Stein stepped in to score the equaliser.
Rangers fans who were on their way down the steep stairs turned and tried to
make their way back up to join in the celebrations - and the tragedy began.
Twenty-five years on, people are still affected by what happened, including the
club captains of that era, Rangers' John Greig and Billy McNeill, of Celtic,
who missed playing in the fateful match, because of injury.
Greig, who is now public relations executive of Rangers, said: ``I have been
involved with Rangers for around 35 years and, irrespective of everything I
have been through, it is the saddest day I can remember - undoubtedly the most
traumatic day in my car
eer. It is something I would never want to go through again and something I
hope nobody ever has to experience again. The sheer enormity of the disaster
gutted everyone at the club.
``I remember a few days afterwards we had a meeting in the dressing room and
Willie Waddell wanted every funeral covered. Everyone at the club had to muck
in.
``I also remember visiting the homes of fans who had lost their lives.
``It is something you never forget and there was an unreal atmosphere about
Ibrox for a long time afterwards. Not one of us connected with the club was
unaffected.''
Billy McNeill said: ``I was injured but watched the match. Obviously we didn't
know anything had happened, for on the final whistle we all headed to the
dressing room. I remember our club doctor, John Fitzimmons, coming in and
taking Neilly Mochan and Jim
my Steel away. It was then we realised something was wrong but we were kept in
the dressing room and the first we heard of the enormity of what had happened
was on the radio on the team bus taking us back to Parkhead.
``It was a real dismal journey back to our ground, although a short one. We
were all shocked by what we had heard.
``I don't think Neilly Mochan ever got over it, because he was heavily involved
in trying to help those poor people who were caught up in the accident. Years
later, Neilly still talked to me about that terrible day.
``In the weeks that followed, there was a strong unity between the clubs - a
combined effort to do all that we could. Of course, the Rangers lads were
affected much more, because they had met some of the people who had lost their
lives, even knew some of
them.
``I can well remember the very moving service at Glasgow Cathedral some time
afterwards - we participated in things like that.''
The teams that day were:
RANGERS - Neef, Jardine, Matheson, Greig, McKinnon, Jackson, Henderson, Conn,
Johnstone, Smith, Stein. Substitute: MacDonald.
CELTIC - Williams, Craig, Gemmell, Brogan, Connelly, Hay, Johnstone, Hood,
Wallace, Callaghan, Lennox. Substitute: Macari.

AS Gordon McLelland stood on Stairway 13 in the immediate aftermath of the
tragedy, a fog of disbelief, a feeling of total unreality, descended.
He was only 19, with a meagre 10 months' service with City of Glasgow Police.
Yet he had just witnessed and been involved in one of the most appalling
tragedies to be visited on the city.
Now 44 and a uniformed sergeant with Strathclyde Police, with 20 of his 25
years' service in the CID, Mr McLelland still has vivid memories of January 2,
1971.
One of the strongest impressions that remains with him was that people were
fighting, lashing out at each other. What he was witnessing was in fact people
fighting for their lives, faces contorted in panic rather than in anger.
Also vividly etched in his mind's eye is the attempt to reach over railings and
extract people who were obviously being crushed, only to watch them die in
front of his eyes.
He was one of many officers inside Ibrox that fateful day with the specific
task of monitoring the spectators leaving the ground via Stairway 13.
His position, which he recollects clearly, was on a grassed area to the left of
the stairway. He was in place 15 minutes before the final whistle was due.
Shortly before this, spectators began leaving, pouring down the stairway.
Everything was normal until the roar went up from inside the ground. Mr
McLelland knows with hindsight exactly what happened but in these few seconds
he was aware only that somethin
g terribly wrong was taking place and that there was a clear impression of
fighting.
``It was very difficult at first to take it in,'' he said. ``The stairway was
packed with people of all ages and there was no immediate reason for fighting.
There was total chaos. My immediate reaction was to run to a marked police
vehicle which was parke
d in Cairnlea Drive. I shouted to the officers in the vehicle to radio for
immediate assistance and then ran back to the stairway.
``I realised that many people were trapped about a third of the way up. Many of
them had fallen. The sheer pressure of hundreds of people further up, who
obviously had no idea what had happened below them, meant that more and more
people were being crushe
d where they stood.
``By this time, there were numerous other police officers at the stairway.
Along with members of the crowd, we were trying to pull people free.
``I recall actually getting one young boy, probably about 16, out of the crush
and it was obvious he had stopped breathing. I had been involved in competitive
swimming and lifesaving competitions so I had been trained in resuscitation
techniques. I starte
d mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and external heart massage as I had been taught.
``I remember thinking at the time that I should keep on doing so until a doctor
or a qualified person pronounced the casualty to be dead.
``I kept on doing so until a doctor reached me and told me it was hopeless,
that the boy was dead.''

The opening quatrain of an earlier verse runs:
I'll write to Arthur Woodburn,     boys,
And he will let you know,
That the Sacred Rights of     Property,
Will never be laid low.

DAVID Rowan Henderson characterises the European Union as the kind of hegemony
planned by Hitler and other European Fascists (December 23).
But what allowed these Fascists to come to power? It was the breakdown of the
European financial system - in which Britain willingly participated - due in
turn to the complete absence of any common financial policy.
To this were added the crippling reparations demanded of Germany by the Allies
after the First World War, hardly a united European policy itself.
Then came the starvation, the social unrest; and only then the fundamentalist
politicians of the left and the right became believable.
A union of European trade and finance would have made it impossible for an
opportunist ex-corporal to put a pistol to the world's head. But he was able to
step straight into the vacuum left in Europe by the collapse of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Mr Henderson alludes to his war service. I hope he will forgive me for pointing
out that he suffered greatly at the hands of the Japanese in the course of
this. But he has put this behind him and knows that the blame does not lie with
the Japanese people,
in whose culture, I believe, he is interested.
Strange that he is unable to reach the same accommodation with his nearer
European neighbours.

PROFESSOR Steve Bruce has proved that Scrooge is still alive and as ill as ever
(December 23).
At a time when there are more Christian believers in the world than at any time
in the history of our faith he says that there are not many of us.
Certainly he claims to be speaking for Scotland, but the fact that 14% of
Scottish adults were sitting in pews on an unheralded Sunday in 1994 is far
from being the whole story.
He adds, without the slightest evidence, that perhaps a further 20% believe in
a personal God. That figure could just as easily be 60%. That would get much
closer, with the 14%, to the 80% who have been reported as claiming belief in
God.
He has trouble with carols. He's not alone on that. The bleak midwinter, though
true of Scotland this year, is not true of all Christians' Christmases. But
Jesus Christ is.
That he was born and lived and died and was raised from death is my belief. It
is also well attested by contemporary records. It is therefore the one truth
about my world that transcends all the hype of modern media and even Professor
Bruce's Scrooge-like
opinions.
I remain one of those clergymen who hope that his annual visit to Church might
prompt a more enduring response. What I'm not is poor.
My riches are my convictions about the Christ who, for me and millions like me,
demonstrated in his own person that love did come down at Christmas, love all
lovely, love divine; and that, praise be, we are all the better for that love.
Professor Bruce is entitled to take his atheism seriously. He is not entitled
to assume that any particular percentage of his fellow-citizens join him in
voting for Scrooge.
He overstates his weight. One look at the sheer enjoyment, faith, and love on
the faces of the people I greeted at our midnight celebration on Christmas Eve
might jolt his dyspeptic unbelief into an infectious faith.
Such a faith would be suitable for children, yes; but also for those adults who
still want to learn how to love.
Perhaps Professsor Bruce would do us a service by composing a new, more honest
carol. I would be interested to read it, and even to sing it, provided that it
honours the Child in the Manger.

ONCE again a minister of the Church of Scotland, the Rev Ivor Gibson, seeks to
lay the blame for the decline in membership outwith the life of the church
itself, saying: ``There is an appalling ignorance of the Christian message
thanks largely to the fail
ure of Religious Education in schools, the collapse of Sunday school, and the
lack of church going'' (December 27).
It may well be the task of Sunday school to make Christians, and it might be
more effective in this task if it stopped recruiting young people who have not
yet worked out their own faith and using them as Sunday school teachers because
no-one else wants t
he responsibility.
It most certainly is the task of church members to bring people to the church,
and hopefully into the faith of the church. They might be more effective in
this if they stopped thinking faith was a private and personal matter.
It is not, and has never been, the task of Religious Education to make
Christians. Religious Education seeks to help pupils find meaning and purpose
in life, and to understand the contribution of the various religions to this
search.
This does not mean indoctrination or evangelism within the classroom, but an
open educational search. It seeks to equip pupils with the tools for the task
and the knowledge and understanding to help in the search.
Pupils are very aware of the valuable contribution that Christianity makes to
this search. They are aware of the words and the challenges of Jesus and the
claims of the church. Sadly they are also aware of the lives of many Christians
whom they meet in th
eir day-to-day lives. So often the two do not correspond.
Christianity for many of them seems to say one thing and the actions of
Christians another. Once these two are in harmony, the church might play a more
active role in the search for meaning and purpose in the lives of young people.

<TEXT>
THE Government which already boasts a thin majority over all other parties is
likely to see it shrink further; and could find itself a minority
administration early next year. Actuaries and other statisticians having been
making confident predictions to t
hat effect, and there seems little reason to doubt their accuracy. The
end-of-term lectures to their colleagues from Dr Mawhinney and Mr Heseltine are
justified in their own terms: parties which insist on public quarrels and
formal splits on important vot
es invite rejection. In spite of an improving economic performance nationally,
that rejection has been firmly fixed on the Tories. It is their own fault, but
has been made even more threatening for them by the simultaneous regard public
opinion still best
ows on Mr Blair. That might not have many short-term implications for a
Government with a secure majority but Mr Major, though he stacked up an
impressive popular vote in 1992, did not manage to translate it into an
unassailable lead in seats.
The electoral arithmetic is relentless. The Tories have not won a by-elecion
since 1989, and no majority, no matter how large, seems to confer a degree of
protection. One by-election is now pending in a Tory-held seat (because of the
former member's death
) and one is threatened (because a sitting member may be facing bankruptcy):
early in the new year Mr Major could be grappling with as small a majority as
Harold Wilson in 1964 but without the favourable electoral trend which allowed
Wilson to go to the c
ountry in the confident expectation of the victory he duly received in 1966.
The experience of the 64 Wilson administration shows that it is possible to
retain office with a small majority; and Mr Callaghan managed, while in a
minority, to hang on to powe
r for months by cleverly manipulating the small parties which are also a
feature of the present Parliament. Time may indeed be running out for the
Tories but their minority, should it materialise, will be under all other
parties combined: their present ma
jority over Labour by itself is a comfortable 55.
The Government has the advantage of retaining the political initiative and Mr
Forsyth's Christmas message to Scots shows how that can be used in commendable
ways which are bound to evoke support across a wide spectrum of political
opinion. It can also be
used in more narrowly partisan ways, through the budgetary mechanism, for
example, to enhance disposable incomes, which outcome ought also to be within
its grasp through reduced interest rates. But these moves need time to shift
opinion and there is littl
e evidence from opinion surveys that they can still actually do so, since
opinion seems to have set in a mould unfavourable to Tory hopes. They may,
after all, have the time to test the permanence of that mould both from the
problem the small parties pres
ent to an Opposition trying to unite them in the same parliamentary lobby, and
from the fact that the Ulster Unionists retain their Conservative identity, and
are there to be wooed. The memory of Lord Carson remains green for both
groupings, and with it i
s the fact that a Labour Government would be far more hostile to the Unionists'
ambitions. The question is whether the Unionists might ask too high a price for
the national interest to bear. But then Governments will pay a lot to ensure
their own survival

<HEADLINE>Getting the picture SNP moves to assist film industry</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974651601</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish National Party has been accused, with some justification, of
exploiting the Braveheart factor in using the popularity of the Mel Gibson
quasi-historical movie epic to stir up patriotic fervour for the nationalist
cause. None the less audience
reaction to the film is rather different in Manchester from the response in
Motherwell and it has probably done the cause no harm. So it is appropriate
that the SNP should return the compliment by proposing moves to assist the
indigenous film industry. T
hat there is nothing radical or astonishing about those proposals should not
surprise us. This is familiar footage and the few crucial steps that are needed
to prevent our film industry being forever described as ``fledgling'' are well
known. The chief an
d most frequently requested move is for tax incentives for investors in film to
parallel those available in Ireland - in contrast to the present situation
where, as the chairman of the Scottish Film Council outlined in Wednesday's
Herald, investors in fil
m are positively discriminated against by comparison with manufacturing
industry.
The competition between Scottish development agencies and those in Ireland for
inward investment from overseas industry has been fiercely contested and
well-documented. It makes no sense whatsoever for the enticement of film making
to Scotland, together w
ith the cash it generates, to be so clearly disadvantaged. Movie-making is set
to overtake the aircraft industry as America's largest foreign currency earner.
There would be a deafening political outcry if Scotland was seen to be fighting
with one arm tie
d behind its back with a jet assembly plant at stake. The level of increase in
Government support for the film industry which would be required to make a
significant difference to its ability to function as a revenue earner is not
large - and the cost imp
lications of tax breaks are nil if film-makers are currently failing to come
here because of the absence of them. Hollywood movies are fantastically
expensive to make and the regular use of Scotland as a location for major
movies would indisputably bring
a great deal of money into the country. That is before any consideration is
made for the impact on the tourist industry and the general promotion of
Scotland overseas that comes as a by-product of appearing on the big screen.
But in common with all branch
es of the media at the end of the twentieth century, there are various scales
of operation in cash terms and a small budget does not mean a reduction in
quality, just a different style of product. As Shallow Grave proved, a
low-budget movie can still have
panache, and has less to do at the box office before it begins to repay its
backers handsomely.
Beyond cash generation, of course, there is the question of jobs. Research
published this month by the Scottish Arts Council has shown that we cannot take
the attitude that artistic endeavours operate at the periphery of the
employment statistics. An anal
ysis of the 1991 census showed that the cultural industries employed as many
people as oil and gas extraction or insurance. Scotland's share of national
employment in film production, distribution, and exhibition is an eminently
improvable 4% in an indust
ry that is concentrated in and around London, but the quality of the freelance
workforce dividing its time between television, advertisements, and movie
making has often been remarked upon. The erratic nature of the work reflects
the fragmented state of t

sustain film-making pool their res

CHRISTMAS with the family on the far west of Lewis; a few inches of the white
stuff, lying deep and crisp and even. Snow, sands, and scenery...... A week
ago, it might have sounded idyllic. Next year, I suspect that it will be
difficult to market.
Lewis, I should explain to BBC reporters and the geographically challenged, is
the one in the top left corner of the map. Shetland is up at the top. Our own
outpost in the parish of Uig is marginally closer to Hawick than to Lerwick.
I make this point because it does become a little irritating, as one sits there
by candle-light, to hear ``Shetland and the Western Isles'' linked together as
if they were adjacent suburbs. For reasons which I will come to in a moment, it
is important to
understand that they are not.
The idyll started to crumble last Saturday evening, at some point between
Grandstand and the National Lottery. It was a chilly evening with a moderate
wind blowing. A rapid flurry of snow coated the ground. Nothing serious, but
definitely ominous.
``I suppose the electricity will go off any time now,'' my wife observed. And
verily, the lights flickered and died. The festive television schedules were
rendered redundant. That most generous offer to the little ones - ``why don't
you go and watch a vid
eo'' - was seized from our grasp. And slowly, it started to grow cold.
Now the point of geography. As the days went by, we would hear a lot about 30ft
drifts in Shetland and ``the worst conditions since the Second World War''.
These images have been used by Hydro-Electric's PR people as if they applied to
all the affected ar
eas, hundreds of miles away. In the interests of accuracy, it should be pointed
out that they did not.
I'm not sure what the urban perception of Hebridean living is these days, but I
assure you that it is as much dependent on electricity as anyone else's. Peat
fires and solid fuel stoves are fine, but unless there is power to circulate
the water, the radia
tors quickly cool.
So the four us huddled up in bed until Christmas Eve dawned. I was on the phone
bright and early to the Hydro-Electric information line. A recorded message
told me that they were aware of the loss of supply in a long list of places and
it was expected tha
t ``power will be restored by around mid-day''.
Experience rendered me sceptical of this reassurance, so I accepted the
invitation to stay on the line until a live voice appeared. Its opening gambit
was, as usual, to ask for a postcode, presumably in order to determine whether
or not I was an imposter
pretending to be the victim of a power cut.
Brief cross-examination of a reluctant witness elicited the more realistic
information that (a) they had no idea what the source of the cuts was; (b) they
therefore had no idea of when power would be restored, and (c) a helicopter was
not due to go out lo
oking for lines down until an hour later. This seemed to place the recorded
message in proper perspective.
In fact, the power cut lasted until 1pm yesterday - five long nights later.
After the first 24 hours, Hydro-Electric gave up on predictions about when it
would come back on. By that time, there were genuinely difficult conditions to
work in and I bow to n
obody in my respect for the linesmen and engineers who habitually battle in
atrocious weather to maintain the supply to remote places.
I am, however, less impressed about their employers, the privatised
Hydro-Electric plc, successors to Tom Johnston's great creation, the North of
Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. And it's not just because of their foolish habit
of giving out misinformation
when people need to know what is actually going on.
The fact is that, in many further-flung parts of the Hydro-Electric area -
including the ones hardest hit over the past week - power cuts are extremely
common and do not require extreme weather conditions to precipitate them. Hence
my wife's prescient res
ponse, the moment snow started to fall.
Rightly or wrongly, this is widely attributed to there being fewer locally
based staff since privatisation and an inadequate programme of renewals and
investment. What is undeniable is that the nature of Hydro-Electric plc, as
opposed to its public servic
e predecessor, has changed dramatically.
It is an under-recognised fact that the electricity industry as a whole paid
more to the Treasury in profits before privatisation than it has done since in
taxation. But I doubt if the Hydro Board was expected to make a positive
contribution to that figur
e. Its social remit was recognised.
Last year, in contrast, Hydro-Electric plc made profits of #168.7 for its
shareholders. Increasingly, they see themselves as a national and international
player in generation and distribution, who happen to be based in the North of
Scotland for historical
reasons.
Fair enough. But someone's first priority has to be the pensioners sitting
without electricity for five days, or the small telecom business which cannot
handle the frequency of power cuts. I welcome the fact that Hydro-Electric's
chairman has promised dis
cussions on these issues once the immediate problems are resolved.
I hope they lead to a clear-cut recognition that continuity of electricity
supply, within the bounds of what is humanly possible, is a first-world right
which has been entrusted to a private company in the Highlands and Islands of
Scotland. It cannot be a
variable extra, dependent on how business is going elsewhere.

<TEXT>
THE proposal by the Institute of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland for a
#650m new canal across Central Scotland has been under consideration before
(December 26).
F Mort, in his book, Dumbartonshire (1920) - yes, the title was spelt with an M
- describes plans for a Forth-Clyde Ship Canal. One scheme proposed a line
following the existing canal.
The other suggested beginning at Grangemouth on the Forth passing south of
Stirling and continuing up the Forth valley for several miles.
Coming round the south-west face of the Campsies it followed the Endrick valley
and would enter Loch Lomond near Balmaha.
There were to be two exits to the open seas. One was by means of a canal to be
cut between Tarbet and Arrochar to give access to Loch Long. The other exit
would consist of a canal from Balloch to Dumbarton.
In 1920, at a depth of 36 feet, the estimated cost was #20m.

READING Mr Skeoch's letter, I was reminded of some hazards of reducing coin
size. On returning from a holiday in the USA and checking my US currency I
found that I had a Susan B Anthony dollar.
The Susan B Anthony dollar is not very common and that which I have is the only
one I have seen. The possible reason for its unpopularity is that, unlike the
old cartwheel silver dollar, it is easily mistaken for a quarter.
I wonder how many people have lost 75 cents in such errors.
Earlier in the year I purchased two #2 celebration coins from the Post Office.
I then saw in a newspaper advertisement that I could have bought two such
mint-condition coins from an address in England post-free.
Can you purchase coin from the Mint in bulk at a discount, and if so why should
anyone want to pass that saving on to me? These coins are legal tender and it
is not as if they were antique coins selling above their face value.
There is an old saying that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is.
What is the catch?

YOUR recent coverage of the Princess of Wales was interesting. I should like to
add that it is time someone pointed out to her that a lot of ordinary women
could also do the Angel of Mercy act that she is so fond of carrying out in
hospitals. It doesn't r

What does require a great deal from one is cleaning up after a patient who has

BENEDICT Brogan in an otherwise excellent article states that Nova Scotia was
ceded by the French to Britain in 1707 under the Treaty of Utrecht (December
23). In fact the Peace of Utrecht was the name of several treaties following
the Utrecht Congress, 1
713-14.
They were concluded at Rastatt in 1714, thus ending the War of the Spanish
Succession and it was there that Nova Scotia became British territory.
Incidentally, I once heard that the American and Canadian nickname for a Nova
Scotian is ``bluenose'', but I have no idea whether this refers to the climate
or has some other deeper meaning.

<TEXT>
I WAS saddened to read that Glasgow District Council has refused a request to
name streets in a new housing development at Robroyston after William Wallace,
despite the fact that it is adjacent to a monument marking the spot where he
was betrayed.
The council claims that several city thoroughfares bear his name and that a
Glasgow streetfinder lists 11 such streets.
Readers in Rutherglen, Paisley, Clydebank, Johnstone, Blantyre, and Renfrew
must have been left with the impression that the new Glasgow city boundaries
have been extended to include them because six of the streets are in their
areas.
Since the list also includes four Wallacewells (Crescent, Place, Quadrant, and
Road in Balornock), there is only one city thoroughfare called simply Wallace,
that is Wallace Street in Kingston.
The district council's logic is even more questionable given that there are
many more than 11 streets in Glasgow alone with Victoria in them and that
nearly all the streets in Croftfoot begin or end in ``croft''.
A few years ago, in the face of fierce opposition, Glasgow District Council
renamed a city centre square after another nation's freedom-fighter, Nelson
Mandela. Surely it is not too late to commemorate one of our own nation's
freedom-fighters, William Wal
lace.

NEW York's mayor Rudolph Giullani would have to be crazy to change the system
of hailing cabs in the street (December 27).
The suicidal practice of launching oneself at a cab from wherever one happens
to be standing is one of the thrills of New York.
The thing that did throw me during a visit there a few months ago was the
response, in unintelligible accents, of many drivers when I asked to be taken

I ENJOYED Frank McGroarty's article on jam jars as currency during the early
decades of the century (December 16). Up to the late forties and early fifties,
the jam jar and bleach bottle still had a monetary value of one halfpenny.
Admission price to La Scala in Airdrie was threepence. The Saturday matinee was
known as the threepenny rush. The whole of Airdrie reverberated to clinking
glass as hordes of working-class weans converged on the cinema next door to a
wee sweetie shop whic
h paid money for jam jars.
Some confectioners operated a kind of scam that was enthusiastically abetted by
young toffee junkies. To buy a bar of toffee, threepence and an E-coupon
snipped from the ration book were necessary, but the use of money for toffee
was by-passed by giving t
wo E-coupons.
To me it was almost mystical, a process that transmuted the base metals of
glass and paper into gold of sweets and hours of entertainment. Even now in my
50s, I still wince when discarding a jeelie jaur.

Does not the absence of consultation with any representative of the Scottish

THE Nationwide Building Society has followed up the Halifax in forecasting an
improvement in the housing market next year. It does not suggest, as did the
Halifax, that 1997 could see a mini-boom, writes CHRIS STONE.
Reporting a ``modest'' fall of 2.5% in the Nationwide House Price Index in 1995
with a slight firming in the underlying trends in house prices since the low
point reached in the summer, Brian Davis, Nationwide's chief executive,
commented: ``Although stil
l tentative, there have been some signs in recent months that the market has at
least stabilised.''
He said the underlying trend in house prices already noted is one factor. In
addition survey evidence from estate agents has been cautiously optimistic
recently and ``this is in accord with our own reading of recent mortgage
lending data, which suggests t
hat the decline in market activity during the first half of 1995 has been
halted.''
Stronger growth in personal incomes, helped by recently announced tax cuts and
a very favourable interest rate environment should provide the conditions
necessary to support an improvement in the market during 1996.
``We believe an increase in transactions of about 10% is possible, and this is
likely to be translated into a modest rise in house prices, of about 3%,'' said
Mr Davis.

A COUPLE of months ago I wrote an article on these pages drawing attention to
the dearth of new Scottish plays. I was looking in particular at the autumn
season when no more than three or four original Scottish pieces got anywhere
near the professional st
age. And looking back now across 1995 as a whole, the question is less a matter
of whether a play was any good as whether it was on at all.
Scottish playwrights are a lively and vocal lot, but through no fault of their
own, it seems they're more likely to be known by reputation than by the names
of their plays. You might possibly have heard of David Greig, David Harrower
and Mike Cullen, but
could you also say which of them was responsible for One Way Street, Knives in
Hens and The Collection in 1995?
If John Clifford, Sue Glover and Chris Hannan are three of our leading
playwrights, how can we explain that none of them had original works staged in
Scotland during the year? And if you've heard people banging on about Iain
Heggie, do you find it accepta
ble that to see his first full-length play in five years - An Experienced Woman
Gives Advice with Siobhan Redmond heading up an excellent cast - you had to
travel to Manchester's Royal Exchange for the privilege?
With this in mind, 1995 was a surprisingly good year for the publication of
Scottish scripts. Making it into print is tremendously important both for the
individual playwright and the cultural awareness of society at large. The
printed word has a kind of
authority that the ephemeral world of the stage lacks; a script says this is
the real and valuable work of a real theatre artist, a thing of substance,
worthy of proper consideration. It can reach people who couldn't get to see it
in performance; it can r
each foreign nations and future generations. The play's the thing, of course,
live in front of our eyes, but the script is rather more durable. It has
cultural clout.
All the same, the market for playscripts is an uncertain one. You might take
Irvine Welsh or A.L Kennedy to bed with you, but how many people settle down
with a good John Byrne? A script is a functional thing, more commonly studied
in schools than slipped
in between your airport novels and your bonk-busters. Theatre Scotland
magazine, which I have edited for the past three years, uses a Trojan horse
approach - lure them in with a David Mamet interview or a Robbie Coltrane
feature, then catch them unawares
with a John Binnie romance or a Stuart Paterson fable. It's a trick that has
enabled Theatre Scotland to publish 15 plays since 1992, a figure unmatched
since the days of John Calder's publications and those of the Scottish Society
of Playwrights in the
1970s.
Call it coincidence, but 1995 was relatively healthy all round for Scottish
play publication. The year began with Methuen's Made in Scotland, an anthology
of four plays selected by me and Ian Brown of the Traverse Theatre. Recognition
for Sue Glover's Bon
dagers, Simon Donald's The Life of Stuff, Mike Cullen's The Cut and Duncan
McLean's Julie Allardyce was more than justified. All but McLean's play have
enjoyed success within and without Scotland and are in the process of being
rewritten for film by the a
uthors. McLean, of course, is celebrated among the bright new wave of Scottish
novelists, but his roots, going back to his days with the Merry Mac Fun Co, lie
equally in performance.
Methuen, under new publisher Michael Earley, is keeping a keen eye on Scottish
playwrights. It published Iain Heggie's An Experienced Woman Gives Advice to
coincide with the play's Manchester run, and picked up on David Harrower's
professional debut, Kniv
es in Hens, in time for its Traverse Theatre transfer to London. Earley has
also expressed interest in Tom McGrath's Scots translation of Stones and Ashes,
the Quebecois play by Daniel Danis that was the highlight of the Traverse's
autumn season.
Of the other London publishers, Oberon maintained its loyalty to Robert David
MacDonald, the Citizens' Theatre's resident polyglot, printing his translations
of Schiller's The Robbers (seen at London's Gate Theatre) and Don Carlos (seen
at the Edinburgh F
estival and in Glasgow). Meanwhile, Faber and Faber not only brought out a
collected edition of the plays of Sharman Macdonald, including her best known
piece, When I was a Girl I used to Scream and Shout, but also was honoured by
having it shortlisted fo
r the McVitie's Prize.
It's heartening to find that back at home passion and commitment are as
fashionable commodities as strict commercial sense. On the west coast the small
publishing house Dualchas has been turning out a slow but steady stream of
oddball writers, sometimes n
ovelists, sometimes playwrights, mainly unclassifiable and all with a lively
sense of performance. ``They're not following traditional narrative styles,
they're more theatrical or dramatic,'' agrees Morag Ramsay of Dualchas whose
most recent release, Hels
inki (Not the Town) by F.N O'Gafferty, is a curious collection of urban
Glaswegian stories and dialogues, not written for the stage but as often as not
looking just like a script.
``Why should there be a strict dividing line?'' says Ramsay. ``We've got a
project for next May with a new author who has written the missing pages of
Gogol's diary. We're going to try and stage it as a play as well. We're trying
to bring all the expressi
ve arts together because they can support each other. We're not doing it for
profit. There's no question that we're doing it for any business reasons. We're
doing it for the content - stuff that we think is worth publishing.''
Over in the east, operating out of Old Grindles Bookshop in Spittal Street,
Diehard Publishers has recently expanded its list to encompass playwrights,
among them John Cargill Thompson, Joy Hendry and Owen Dudley Edwards. ``We
started off as a general pub
lisher and the drama side took off more than the rest,'' says Diehard's Ian
King who has his own binding machine which gives him great flexibility in the
size of his print runs. ``When I was young the problem was that all the scripts
in the library were 5
0 years out of date and, stuck in Dunfermline, you ended up writing like
Bernard Shaw because that's what you got thrust upon you. I wanted to get away
from that syndrome of everybody writing old-fashioned plays. We'll be doing
these scripts five or six t
imes a year.''
King admits that play publishing is something of a kamikaze field, although his
most popular titles have sold out and even returned a small profit. Like
Ramsay, he's prepared to do it for the love of it how else could you account
for the six months of met
iculous proof-reading he's just put in to his next release, the early plays of
George Buchanan, a contemporary of John Knox, whose output was entirely in
Latin? He's not expecting a best seller.
For all this activity, though, I'm well aware that I'd never write an article
trumpeting about the number of plays published by English writers. Scotland's a
considerably smaller country, of course, but we're still talking about a pretty
feeble number of
publications. That's not a reflection on the publishers, who can hardly be said
to be raking in the money after all, it's more an indictment of a theatre
system that for one reason or another is not giving adequate voice to its
playwrights.

FOLLOWING its victory in the battle for South West Trains, bus giant Stagecoach
has confirmed its appetite for further railway acquisitions, writes KRISTY
DORSEY.
A spokesman for the Perth-based company said yesterday that Stagecoach was
considering making a bid for London's Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which runs
driverless trains in the east of the City's financial district. ``All I can say
is Stagecoach has ex
pressed a preliminary interest (in the franchise),'' the spokesman said.
An earlier statement from DLR said consultation on the future of the line had
prompted ``significant interest'' from potential bidders. The formal
competition for the franchise is set to begin early next year, and the
successful bidder is expected to be i
dentified in the autumn.
Company chairman Brian Souter has said that Stagecoach intends to bid for all
available franchises and is particularly interested in the London commuter
services, which makes a DLR bid seem all the more likely.
Stagecoach shares reached a record high yesterday, extending gains made since
the successful South West Trains bid. The stock closed up 12p at 352p, its
sixth day of gains since closing at 282p on December 18.

PROFESSOR Steve Bruce has proved that Scrooge is still alive and as ill as ever
(December 23).
At a time when there are more Christian believers in the world than at any time
in the history of our faith he says that there are not many of us.
Certainly he claims to be speaking for Scotland, but the fact that 14% of
Scottish adults were sitting in pews on an unheralded Sunday in 1994 is far
from being the whole story.
He adds, without the slightest evidence, that perhaps a further 20% believe in
a personal God. That figure could just as easily be 60%. That would get much
closer, with the 14%, to the 80% who have been reported as claiming belief in
God.
He has trouble with carols. He's not alone on that. The bleak midwinter, though
true of Scotland this year, is not true of all Christians' Christmases. But
Jesus Christ is.
That he was born and lived and died and was raised from death is my belief. It
is also well attested by contemporary records. It is therefore the one truth
about my world that transcends all the hype of modern media and even Professor
Bruce's Scrooge-like
opinions.
I remain one of those clergymen who hope that his annual visit to Church might
prompt a more enduring response. What I'm not is poor.
My riches are my convictions about the Christ who, for me and millions like me,
demonstrated in his own person that love did come down at Christmas, love all
lovely, love divine; and that, praise be, we are all the better for that love.
Professor Bruce is entitled to take his atheism seriously. He is not entitled
to assume that any particular percentage of his fellow-citizens join him in
voting for Scrooge.
He overstates his weight. One look at the sheer enjoyment, faith, and love on
the faces of the people I greeted at our midnight celebration on Christmas Eve
might jolt his dyspeptic unbelief into an infectious faith.
Such a faith would be suitable for children, yes; but also for those adults who
still want to learn how to love.
Perhaps Professsor Bruce would do us a service by composing a new, more honest
carol. I would be interested to read it, and even to sing it, provided that it
honours the Child in the Manger.

Along with Inverness businessman Alastair Gardner and former Black Isle
resident Ned Wayne, Mr Hill accepted responsibility for inadequate book-keeping
and records as directors of a failed tourist booking agency, Hi-Line.
A breach of the Companies Act involving an #11,000 car loan was also brought to
light in the Department of Trade and Industry case.
Hi-Line went into liquidation owing #358,000.
Although it was stressed during the action that there had been no question of
dishonesty on the part of the three men, the soon-to-be wound up Ross and
Cromarty Tourist Board advised Mr Hill to quit the post after the court ruling,
despite previously back
ing his application.
Ross and Cromarty Tourist Board chairman Ian McCrae said: ``He quite flatly
refused to resign when the board asked me to go and see him. He said he had
done nothing wrong and, of course, he was within his rights.
``But, to put it bluntly, I do not like it. This has caused a great deal of
irritation.
``My personal opinion is, and I do not care what the circumstances are, the way
forward should have been for him to resign from both Ross and Cromarty and the
new board.''
The HSTB takes power next April after the national reorganisation of tourist
boards.
The new board's chairman, hotelier Nicol Manson, said there were no plans to
take Mr Hill out of the unpaid post.
He said: ``Just because Mr Hill is barred from being a director of a limited
company, a company limited by guarantee, does not mean he should not be a
director of the Highlands of Scotland Tourist Board, which is a statutory body.
``They are not alike, and there is no comparison - it's as simple as that.''
Mr Hill, 53, confirmed he had been asked to resign by Ross and Cromarty Tourist
Board.
He said: ``I do not think I have done anything to be ashamed of. It is
ridiculous for anyone to say there is a need for me to resign from a public
body.
``I know my reputation has been dented but I feel we were made scapegoats.''
The Scottish Tourist Board's depute director of visitor services said: ``From
the legal position, everything is OK, but as for the moral question, I do not
think the STB can comment.''

ONCE again a minister of the Church of Scotland, the Rev Ivor Gibson, seeks to
lay the blame for the decline in membership outwith the life of the church
itself, saying: ``There is an appalling ignorance of the Christian message
thanks largely to the fail
ure of Religious Education in schools, the collapse of Sunday school, and the
lack of church going'' (December 27).
It may well be the task of Sunday school to make Christians, and it might be
more effective in this task if it stopped recruiting young people who have not
yet worked out their own faith and using them as Sunday school teachers because
no-one else wants t
he responsibility.
It most certainly is the task of church members to bring people to the church,
and hopefully into the faith of the church. They might be more effective in
this if they stopped thinking faith was a private and personal matter.
It is not, and has never been, the task of Religious Education to make
Christians. Religious Education seeks to help pupils find meaning and purpose
in life, and to understand the contribution of the various religions to this
search.
This does not mean indoctrination or evangelism within the classroom, but an
open educational search. It seeks to equip pupils with the tools for the task
and the knowledge and understanding to help in the search.
Pupils are very aware of the valuable contribution that Christianity makes to
this search. They are aware of the words and the challenges of Jesus and the
claims of the church. Sadly they are also aware of the lives of many Christians
whom they meet in th
eir day-to-day lives. So often the two do not correspond.
Christianity for many of them seems to say one thing and the actions of
Christians another. Once these two are in harmony, the church might play a more
active role in the search for meaning and purpose in the lives of young people.

<HEADLINE>Problems caused by poverty of the pulpit</HEADLINE>

I WAS saddened and angered to read Robert Wilson's statement that retiring
clerics should move away from the district in which they served (December 26).
Mr Wilson clearly does not understand the problems caused by the poverty of the
pulpit. The cleric's stipend and retirement pension are so low that he is
likely to be dependent on the earnings of his wife and children in order to
avoid destitution.
In my family's case where we lived on quitting the tied house on my father's
retirement from the ministry depended upon where I and my brother worked.
Furthermore, my father's stipend was so low that we were not able to apply for
posts away from home as our earnings were needed in order to provide for the
immediate needs of our parents as well as for ourselves. We had to act as
carers from a very early
age.
Not only is it un-Christian to dump people when they are perceived to be no
longer useful but it is also very hurtful.
Should not church members put enough in the plate in order to finance a
properly paid clergy? Only when this is done can clergy and their families have
the opportunity of choosing where they shall live.
