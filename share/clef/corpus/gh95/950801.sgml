CARPATHIAN can land a royal victory in today's Brighton Challenge Cup.
The Queen has landed numerous big races in more than 40 years as an
owner with the highlight, perhaps, the dual Classic wins of Dunfermline
in the Silver Jubilee year of 1977.
Yet her colours have been carried to success on many of the smaller
tracks too, as Carpathian himself has proved.
The colt may be royally bred -- he is the second foal out of Oaks
winner Diminuendo -- but he has spent most of his time in lesser company
and has scored on the all-weather courses of Lingfield and Southwell
this year.
Most significantly, he seemed to take to this unusual, switchback
course like a natural when he contested a mile-and-a-half handicap here
back in May and won with a good deal of authority.
Carpathian races off a mark only 5lb higher today and a good second at
Epsom last week suggests he is in the form to resume winning ways.
Frankie Dettori should be on the mark at Catterick where Crackernat
will be hard to beat in the Fraggles Conditions Stakes.
The champion jockey's mount looked a useful prospect when he made most
of the running to land a six-furlong race at York last month, staying on
very strongly to beat the odds-on Al Shafa by a head.
Dettori is sure to ride a positive race again on Crackernat, whose
stamina will be seen to even better advantage over today's extra
furlong.
Kalar is another good bet to make all in the closing Lillibulero
Handicap.
Speed out of the stalls is always at a premium in sprints at Catterick
and the front-running Kalar will be very much the one to catch in this
five-furlong contest.
He ran a fine race from a disadvantageous high draw when second of 17
here last month and can confirm that run was no fluke by going one place
better this time.

I am very distressed at the way Heart of Midlothian have handled this
thing
A STAGGERING list of litigation involving Hearts now will be added to
when Falkirk sue the Edinburgh club over last night's change of heart by
Jim Jefferies.
George Fulston, the Brockville chairman, has pledged legal action
against the Edinburgh club after having met Jefferies in the capital
yesterday to learn of his about turn. And in addition to recourse to
law, Falkirk are reporting their rivals to the Scottish League over
their talks with the manager who has served them for five years.
Foulston believes that Chris Robinson, the Hearts chairman, spoke to
Jefferies on Sunday, two days after a deadline had been set for
discussions for the club he played for and captained.
''I met with Jim and can confirm that he has changed his mind and
joined Hearts. We will be suing Hearts and referring the matter to the
Scottish League,'' confirmed Foulston.
''I am very distressed at the way Heart of Midlothian have handled
this thing.''
Yesterday's change of mind appears to end a bizarre episode, Jefferies
was believed to be wavering back toward Falkirk at stages, and the final
chapter depends on the existence of a sheet of A4 paper.
Robinson pursued his interest in the chosen replacement for Tommy
McLean in the belief that the business that had been conducted in
Brockville's board room on Saturday had been the subject of a hand
shake.
However, a document was signed by the new Hearts manager, which
referred to alterations to the contract which he was considering. This
was signed and witnessed.
The eventual agreement over a seven-year contract worth #100,000 a
year, will make Falkirk's claim for recompense one of the biggest in the
history of Scottish football.
And it joins a growing catalogue of legal action involving Hearts,
some resolved, some not, for in the 13 months since Robinson and Leslie
Deans replaced Wallace Mercer, there have been eight instances of legal
proceedings.
Last summer Sandy Clark and his assistant, Hugh McCann, sued following
their dismissals. After Clark froze several club bank accounts,
settlements for both were reached out of court.
Club accountant Gary Hay and commercial manager Charles Burnett
followed similar legal routes, and again Hearts offered payments, prior
to judgments being made.
The co-owners of Hearts are in possession of a writ from Mercer
seeking #125,000 from last June's exchange of shares. That case will be
heard shortly.
But Robinson and Deans have a counter action over warranties and
guarantees relating to the description of the club at the time of sale.
McLean's legal team delivered another writ on Friday, over the final
two years of his contract in which #200,000 is claimed following his
dismissal. If, as expected, Eamonn Bannon follows him, a similar action
could be winging its way to Gorgie Road.
It is an astonishing backlog of claims against a club who already have
borrowings in excess of #4m, but on the playing side, Jefferies'
decision is a tonic. ''I am delighted that Jim is coming to Tynecastle.
He was a great favourite as a player and I am certain he'll be as
manager,'' said player Gary Mackay.
And to add to Falkirk's misery they were beaten 4-1 at home by
Tranmere in a pre-season friendly last night.

Tommy Burns and I are different types of people. He realises my
limitations and I realise his limitations.
CELTIC'S managing director Fergus McCann last night admitted that, in
certain aspects, his club was perhaps two or three years behind Rangers,
but, despite suggestions that all was not well between himself and
manager Tommy Burns, he pointed out that he believed they could bring
success to the new Parkhead.
McCann's forthright views on the game also included a belief that
Scotland did not need a national stadium and that the country could
support only eight to 10 top clubs.
He realises some mistakes have been made, but believes he, with the
help of a lot of hard workers, has achieved much in the first year of
the new regime.
McCann, as he surveyed the new giant stand at Celtic Park, also said
he had no regrets about taking on a ''massive job'' and confirmed that
his intention of getting out after five years was a genuine statement.
''I don't think anyone should go into a job of this intensity for more
than five years,'' he told me. ''It just wouldn't be smart. At my age I
don't want to make a long-term career. I look upon this as a project and
I have a good team of people around me. It is not just dependent on me.
I have other things to do with my life and when my time is up here I
will go back to my home in Bermuda, play some golf, and live a healthier
life. By that time a better person may be ready to carry on the job
here.
''But I want people to judge me on what we have achieved at the end of
five years, not just on what has been done so far. When I came to the
club I wasn't used to being constantly in the public gaze or receiving
public criticism, but I suppose that comes with the job.
''I've no regrets about the job, but what I do regret is people
writing stories for stories sake.
''For example, there was the suggestion that someone was killed on the
construction site, the television gantry was declared unsafe, Celtic
forgot about television arrangements, and there was demonstrations from
the locals. If you believe all those things then you wouldn't be
believing anything that was true.
''It's the same with all the transfer stories -- blown out of all
proportion. Tommy Burns has maybe made enquiries about 50 players in 50
weeks, but that doesn't mean he has made bids for them.''
On the subject of Burns, who openly criticised the managing director
after the Scottish Cup final, McCann said: ''Tommy Burns and I are
different types. He realises my limitations and I realise his
limitations. I know he is under a lot of pressure from the fans and the
media. He has a football viewpoint and, in some cases, I have to take a
more pragmatic approach.
''But you could say that about most clubs. One thing is certain -- we
both have the same objective and that is to make a success of Celtic.''
On Rangers, McCann said: ''They have a big start on us at the moment,
because up until we won the Scottish Cup we had a six-year no-win
period. It will take us two to three years to catch up in some areas,
but we are doing a lot of right things here.''
On the question of why the Fergus McCann-Brian Dempsey alliance
folded, the man would only say: ''Perhaps you had better ask Brian, but
I have no axe to grind there. He was given every opportunity to invest
in the club and chose not to.''
Did he believe there was a conspiracy against Celtic, either from
within football or the media?
''I wouldn't say there was a conspiracy, but the best way to answer
the question is to say that we are not always surrounded by friends.
Take the double punishment handed out to us when Tommy Burns joined us
from Kilmarnock. I don't think that kind of thing would have happened if
it was a club like, say, Raith Rovers.''
McCann also shot down suggestions that he was something of a one-man
band.
''Of course I listen to the other board members. If I did everything
myself I would go nuts. You will never be a success in any field if you
don't listen to others and, at times, take advice.''
McCann, who also revealed that all the money coming through the
turnstiles and from season ticket sales, did not pay the existing wage
bill at Parkhead, said that there were too many clubs in the league and
that in many cases fans were being asked to watch ''second-class
professionalism''.
He said: ''There are too many clubs, too few supporters, and certainly
not enough investors.
''There should be only eight, no more than 10 top clubs. The Scottish
League should have capital and stadium requirements. What is going on is
a lot of subsidy from Celtic and Rangers. I just didn't realise the
extent of that when I came here.''
And when it came to a question of the money being poured into the new
Hampden, McCann said: ''I don't see the need for a national stadium. The
money should go to the clubs and big matches could be staged at other
venues such as Ibrox and Parkhead. Also, both the SFA and the League are
top heavy in administration for such a small industry.''
A lot of people will not like what McCann says, but the man is not
afraid to admit that he doesn't know everything or that he has some
overnight solution to the Celtic situation. He does, however, believe in
what he says and what he is trying to achieve.
''We are doing a lot of right things here,'' he said. ''We are not in
a transfer competition, but we will make further signings in the right
circumstances. And, as I said, let the critics and everyone else judge
me after my five years are up.''

Trail of a rugby revolution.
SCOTLAND'S top rugby players are pointing a loaded gun at the head of
the SRU, thinking a while, and gently squeezing the trigger. Whether
this game of brinkmanship ends in tears or smiles and handshakes, it's
too early to say, but it has emerged that some of the country's leading
internationalists have, indeed, been approached by the Packer circus,
and are mulling over the consequences.
The SRU will meet on Friday to decide on their course of action, with
player contracts perhaps top of the list.
The consequences of stars going with Packer would be that they would
be banned from playing for Scotland, a terrible fate for a group of
young men who started their rugby careers as young boys with that aim.
One current internationalist, who would not be named, told me: ''Yes,
some of us have signed confidentiality agreements. We are being advised
in every step, but I am not prepared to say who is telling us what to do
at the moment.
''It is so secret that we don't even really speak to each other about
it. Not everybody has been approached, though, and so not everyone has
signed.''
Like the big-money deals that keep South African provincial players
quiet about their rugby earnings, the provisional agreements that some
of the Scottish players have signed include secrecy clauses that forbid
any discussion on the topic.
I understand that the players have been told that it is the intention
of the Packer circus to confront the world's rugby unions at one time
with a list of the signatures they have obtained, and only if they have
reached their target number of signatures will they proceed.
The proposed tournament is to run between March and October 1996, and
it is planned to encompass three main areas of the world -- North,
South, and Central -- and culminate in a series of international
competitions. More than 500 games are planned for the period.
A total of 900 players are being recruited in five strata, 20 of them
Scottish, with salaries varying with seniority between #33,000 and
#150,000 a year, and signing-on fees of up to #180,000 on top of that.
All of which makes mouth-watering reading to young men in a country like
Britain, which purports to have an average working salary of around
#15,000 a year.
''All we really want to do is to play for our country,'' continued the
player. ''I don't suppose that many of us really think that this Packer
thing will take off. Look at the salaries bill they will have to find.
None of us really wants to leave the country, but it has got to the
stage now where we need to be looked after.
''I expect that we will be asking for something of the order of
#20,000 a year, perhaps a share of the gate receipts on top of that, and
some kind of savings scheme. Top-level rugby is a short career.''
Freddie McLeod, who will be travelling to the International Board
meeting with Allan Hosie, has now met with Gavin Hastings in his quest
for a solution to Scotland's particular problems. ''Gavin has put
forward some interesting proposals, and he had some good thoughts,''
said McLeod. ''I am hoping to meet with other players soon.''
Hastings, who announced his retirement as captain this summer, would
appear to be acting in an advisory capacity, but refused to confirm or
deny this. ''I was asked the same question by Freddie,'' said Hastings,
''but I am saying nothing about this subject at all. If I did, I would
only get drawn into it.''
Hosie, the former international referee, said he was amazed at the
players even considering the topic of Packer before the International
Board meeting at the end of August. ''Obviously things are going to
change, and the players should realise that the biggest single meeting
in the history of the IB is happening in a few weeks,'' he said.
''Freddie and I will also be getting our instructions from the SRU
committee this Friday night, and the Scottish mandate will be agreed
then. I think that the players should be waiting to see what happens. Do
they really think that this Packer thing will come about?''

FORMER Rangers striker Duncan Ferguson will face up to Celtic at
Goodison Park tonight and attempt to play himself into the Scotland
squad for the European Championship clash with Greece at Hampden later
this month.
Last night, when Scotland manager Craig Brown heard Ferguson would
play in the testimonial game for Neville Southall he immediately altered
his plans.
Said Brown: ''I was planning to see Duncan in the friendly with Oldham
at the weekend -- but this is an ideal opportunity to take a look at
him.
''I wanted to see him before naming my squad for the Greek game and I
know tonight's match won't be any friendly. This will be as competitive
as you will get and I will have the chance to assess Ferguson. I already
have a good report on how he played against Tranmere last week and this
will be the up-date I need.
''I shall be at Goodison and shall speak to the big fellow afterwards
to see how he feels.''
Added Ferguson: ''I don't know where the stories came from that I
didn't want to play in this match -- that's nonsense. This is the kind
of game any player enjoys.
''I know that I will get a bit of stick from the Celtic fans but that
won't worry me, that kind of thing never does. I will be up for this
one, believe me.
''I want to be in the Scotland squad again and I want to help them
qualify for the European Championship finals, and if we can beat Greece
then we could be there. Getting this chance to impress the Scotland
manager is just what I need at this stage of the pre-season.''
Everton also hope to field their close-season capture from Manchester
United, the Russian internationalist, Andrei Kanchelskis, for his home
debut.
Celtic will stick by the squad who have been in action in all their
pre-season games so far. This time, though, Phil O'Donnell will start
the game and Tom Boyd will also play through the 90 minutes following
his appearance at Birmingham.
Says manager Tommy Burns: ''We have been working up all the time
during our pre-season programme, always looking to improve the
opposition and ourselves at the same time.
''This is the toughest game we have faced so far and we have Newcastle
at the weekend which could be even more difficult. By the time the real
action gets under way we will be ready.''

THE two goals Ally McCoist scored in the pre-season tournament at
Ibrox are, he believes, the first signs of the rebirth of his scoring
career with Rangers.
Yesterday, as McCoist looked back on two years scarred by injury, he
promised that there were still goals to come -- ''and plenty of them.''
Since he broke a leg in Lisbon playing for Scotland against Portugal
in a World Cup qualifying game, the striker's career has stumbled from
one injury crisis to another.
''It all started with that broken leg,'' he pointed out. ''After that
I had a hernia operation, two torn calf-muscles -- in different legs, an
ankle operation in the close season just past, and seven stitches in a
knee gash I collected against St Mirren in the closed-doors game.
''The thing which kept me going was the fact that all the injuries
were different. It was not as if I was carrying the same knock all the
time. That wasn't the case, so I had to place optimism alongside realism
as I looked at the problems I had.
''Then, just when I thought things were going well what happened? I
injured a knee which kept me out of the pre-season tour of Denmark.
''Still, that is behind me now and it was tremendous to get back
playing and getting among the goals.''
Indeed, McCoist is relishing the new season. He has looked at the
talent amassed at Ibrox by manager Walter Smith and recognises the
challenges which face every player competing for a first-team place, and
has taken it all on board.
''This,'' he said, ''is the strongest squad I have ever seen at the
club. It may well turn out to be the best team we have had, too. But
when you look at the quality of player the manager has brought in and
the battle that there will be for places, you realise what has been
going on here during the summer.
''Take a look at the midfield. You have Paul Gascoigne, Brian Laudrup,
Stuart McCall, Ian Durrant, Trevor Steven, Ian Ferguson, Alexei
Mikhailichenko, and Charlie Miller. All of them are great players but
some won't get into the side. I think it will be the same in all areas
of the team.''
''Obviously, Europe is of major importance to us this season after the
disappointments of the past two seasons. We're all desperate to be in
the Champions' League. We've got to be there. It is something we want
for the fans, for the club, and for the whole of Scottish football. I
believe we can qualify this time.
''We won't underestimate the Cypriots but we know that we should win
and that's what we intend to do. The Champions' League is where we want
to be and it would be good to recreate the memories of the last time we
were there.''
McCoist also admitted that he spent a frustrating time as a spectator
for most of last season, watching Laudrup conjure up chance after chance
for the front men.
''It broke my heart to see all those chances going abegging,'' he
said.
''Brian seems happier making scoring opportunities than he does
scoring himself. It's incredible what he can do, and not being able to
team up with him last season was a major blow. I'm sure that I'll get
plenty of goals this season with the kind of service that's going to be
available.''
0 The Rangers manager pointed out: ''Alastair will get among the goals
again, because that is what he does best. Anyone who has written him off
will get their answer in the right place at the right time. I have no
worries about him at all.''
According to McCoist, he will not be the only person to get goals. ''I
believe there will be lots of openings because of the quality of player
we have here, and I also think that Paul Gascoigne will score more goals
than expected.''
McCoist would also love to score his 300th competitive goal for
Rangers next week in the European Cup preliminary-round tie against
Anorthosis.
Talking of which, Smith will watch the Cypriot champions in action
tonight on their tour of Germany.
Backroom man Ewen Chester has already watched one of their tour games
but now Smith will see another as Rangers complete preparations for the
clash which may mean many millions more pounds being added to the Ibrox
coffers.

LIZ McColgan has refused to reveal the identity of the coach who has
helped get her back into shape to challenge for the world 10,000 metres
title.
Despite having raced on the track only twice since the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics, Scotland's former world 10,000m champion proclaimed herself as
fit as ever, ready to face Scottish rival Yvonne Murray in a bid to
regain the crown she won in Tokyo four years.
As she prepared to fly out for the event which open in Gothenburg on
Friday, McColgan said she has had a new female coach for the past four
months: ''the best coach I've ever had. But I have promised to keep her
identity secret meantime. She is a former runner, for whom I have the
greatest respect.''
McColgan, recovered from career-threatening injury, and contemplating
litigation over the handling of her problems, was bubbly and relaxed as
she spoke of her hopes for Sweden.
''At the start of the year, I wondered if I would make the team. But
now, having run my fastest 5000m in Belgium recently, I have a lot more
confidence.
''People have written me off, saying I will never get back, but I
don't bother with that. I just keep my head down and get on with the
training. I have worked damned hard -- as hard as I have ever done. I
could not get any fitter.
''The 5000m was a word-record attempt, and I felt that with so little
track racing behind me, it was premature to get involved. I wish now
that I had.
''I want to forget the last two years and start enjoying championship
competition again. I think I can do well.
''There are a lot of good girls out there. I can't see them jogging
around for 9000m and then going for it. It should be a true race.''
McColgan was in London for the announcment of a new sponsor for the
London Marathon which she is committed to running next spring. Flora,
the margarine manufacturers, are spreading #6m over three years, the
biggest deal in the race's 15-year history.

COURSE punters who backed the 1-12 winner, Al Shafa, at Brighton last
evening could have saved themselves the bother. The youngster should
have faced just two rivals in the maiden race but his task was made even
easier when Suparoy had to be withdrawn.
The other contender, Miss Carottene, never got to grips with the
favourite but the deduction of 5p in the pound following the withdrawal
meant that, for every #12 that on-course customers staked, they had only
a profit of 35p.
Betting shop customers had no chance of backing the winner in the
first place with the 10% betting tax on off-course bets making it
impossible to back horses at odds of 1-10 or shorter.

* SALLY Gunnell, unable to defend her hurdles title in Sweden, now is
almost certainly out of the 4 x 400m relay. She was blown away by
Scotland's Mel Neef in Rhede, Germany, on Sunday in a final trial to
assess her fitness. Neef clocked the second fastest time of her life,
51.45, finishing second to Deon Hemmings (50.80).
Gunnell was sixth in 53.22 and feels she cannot justify keeping

Arbroath 0, Aberdeen 0
ABERDEEN lost Scotland striker Eoin Jess with injury last night
against Arbroath to add to their mounting problems, writes Ian Broadley.
Jess was forced to limp out of the match after 13 minutes after a
hefty tackle by defender John Fowler.
His loss presented a comeback opportunity for Scotland colleague Scott
Booth, making his return for the first time since being injured while
scoring for his country against Russia last November.
Not unnaturally, Booth showed visible signs of his lengthy absence but
nevertheless managed to test Arbroath's trialist goalkeeper on several
occasions. That was more than many of his Dons team-mates were able to
do as their lack of penetration, a problem which plagued them all last
season, re-emerged.
Jess should have scored before his injury but thereafter Aberdeen
struggled ominously against their third division rivals and there will
be much for their manager to ponder today as his side travels south for
their English tour where plans for the forthcoming campaign will be
honed.
* OWEN Coyle opened the scoring for Bolton last night when the English
side defeated Queen's Park 3-0 in a friendly match. Bolton's second was
scored by Andy Thompson, with the third coming from Fabian De Freitas.

FORMER world champion Graeme Obree rode the fastest 4000 metres in the
world this year yesterday, stepping up his drive to re-establish himself
as world No.1.
The Scot was disqualified from the defence of the world 4000m pursuit
title last year because he used an outlawed riding position. However,
early yesterday, he came within two seconds of his world record of
4min.20.894sec, which he set in winning the 4000m title in Norway in
1993.
''I cannot believe it,'' said Obree, who had scheduled for a time of
4-35. ''When I heard with two laps to go that I was under 4-25 only then
did I decide to have a real go. I must be approaching top form, and yet
I have not worked for it. In fact, I have been holding back.''
Clocking 4-22.618, Obree looks set to complete a hat trick of British
pursuit titles. He broke his British record by 12 seconds, and was the
fastest qualifier for the semi-finals by nearly seven seconds.
And in the round of the last four, Obree had an easy victory, despite
going back more than six seconds on his qualifying time. He clocked
4-28.926, and now will face Bryan Steel with hopes of beating his own
world record of 4:20.894 in the final.
Obree had to revise his riding style from the downhill skier position,
now banned, after he had twice set the world hour record and won a world
title. He has developed what he calls the Superman style, with his
extra-long arms stretched ahead on elongated triathlon-style handlebars.
The City of Edinburgh RC trio of Jacques, Hoy, and Stewart Brydon
clocked 48.469 to win the Olympic sprint final, beating CC Lancashire by
just under a second. TS Tameside beat Harlow CC in the ride-off for
bronze. Results:
Open 4000m pursuit (semi-final): G Obree (Die Continentale)
4min.28.926sec beat M Illingworth (Team Clean) 4-37.339; B Steel (Team
Chilwell) 4-32.232 beat R Hayles (Futurama) 4-32.723.
Olympic sprint (final): City of Edinburgh RC (48.469) beat CC
Lancashire (49.439). Bronze medal: TS Tameside 49.761 beat Harlow CC
50.297.

FALKIRK'S Colin Gillies heads the Scottish challenge for the
prestigious Glenmuir Club Professional Championship, which tees off
across West Hill Golf Club in Surrey today.
Having landed the Scottish Professional Championship at Dalmahoy in
such impressive fashion in May, Gillies hinted at a return to that form
on Saturday when he ran out a four-stroke winner in the Montrose Links
Pro-Am.
Defending his title is Ireland's David Jones, the former European Tour
professional who edged ahead of Robin Mann in last year's tournament at
North Berwick. Also competing for the winner's cheque of #8000 are
Scotland's former winners Russell Weir, of Cowal, and Edzell's Alastair
Webster.
With the first points for the 1996 Johnnie Walker PGA Cup being
awarded at the end of 72 holes of strokeplay on Friday, competition will
be double edged. Interest from the 11-strong Scottish contingent will be
keen considering the Ryder Cup-style match will be played at Gleneagles.

Scottish Hard-Court Championships at Dundee's Games Club when he
whitewashed former national junior champion Owen Hadden in yesterday's

deficit before overcoming James Pankhurst 7-5, 6-1. McKnight, 19, said:

FROM your tee-shot at a par 3 to a soft green, your ball embeds itself
on the lip of the hole, with part of the ball within the circumference
of the hole, part outside, and all below the level of the lip of the
hole.
Have you got a hole-in-one?
YES. Decision 16/2 confirms this, but the next item in the R and A's
oracle on the rules, Decision 16/3, points out that if part of the ball
is above the level of the lip the ball, by definition, is not holed. The
ball can be played as it lies, or lifted, the damage repaired, and
replaced on the lip of the hole -- a rare case of a ball required to be
replaced legally being put back in a slightly different position.

* This week's tip comes from GEORGE HAMPTON, the professional at
Pitlochry Golf Club.
MY tip is -- think swing. The point to remember is that it is the loft
of the club that lifts the ball into the air, so just think about making
a smooth and complete swing that rotates round the head.
Also, swing within yourself; you should always feel that you could hit
the ball harder. That helps maintain balance.
John Daly is known for his huge hitting. But watch him -- he never
loses balance, and he always completes his swing.
A good tip for ensuring the correct rotation around the head is to
follow the clock principle. Imagine that a clock-face is on the ground,
swing back at 20-past, and swing through at quarter-to. On the follow
through, extend the right arm and complete a full swing.
When I was playing in the Scottish Seniors' championship last year, my
partner stood on the first tee muttering: ''Complete the swing, complete
the swing.''
It was a good swing thought -- obviously his key to making sure he
followed right through on the shot.
Too many handicap players try to ''lift'' the ball into the air with a
bad swing. They launch themselves at the shot, fall back, and lose
balance. Let the club-head do the work -- think swing.

<HEADLINE>Pressure will come from low-cost producers, claims commentator. Bleak forecast for lamb prices</HEADLINE>

THE British lamb industry was effectively sold out during the most
recent round of Gatt negotiations, it was claimed yesterday.
All producers can look forward to is a continued downward pressure on
prices offset by aid packages for the environmental benefits sheep
grazing brings to remote areas.
Matt Dempsey, the highly regarded Irish farming journalist and
commentator, made no apology for his downbeat forecast at the opening of
the 1995 World Sheep and Wool Congress at Malvern, Worcestershire.
Pressures would come from low cost producers in New Zealand and the
central and eastern European countries, whose production costs were no
more than half the EU average, he said.
In Britain, politicians would be happy to see the industry as a
sacrificial lamb in fostering relationships with former
colonial-friendly Third World countries. In Europe, sheep accounted for
only 2% of total EU agricultural output, relegating it to a low priority
except in Greece and Spain, where the industry was well protected.
''It is, in my view, impossible to envisage lamb prices doing anything
but continuing to decline. The pressures are too great and too much has
already been conceded to low cost producers elsewhere and will be
conceded in the foreseeable future,'' said Mr Dempsey.
''If sheep are leaving a reasonable profit, then you are producing a
product for which there is a long term sustainable demand and you are
producing a product in deficit. If your production is based on marginal
land or by-products of labour or material, then I believe you should
stick at it.
''But for those on good land in a sheep-only enterprise, I would think
long and hard before borrowing for expansion.''
However, New Zealand delegate Brian Chamberlain argued that all lamb
producing countries faced the same problem of competition with cheap
pork and chicken in a commodity market.
''If we carry on as we have been doing for the last 30 years or so, we
are heading for oblivion. If not for oblivion then certainly for a much
smaller share of the potential market than we have now, and I don't
think any of us wants that,'' he said.
The answer was to get out of the commodity or volume market and market
a superior raw material to the two billion or so of the world's
consumers who demanded the best in a form they found attractive.
The sheep industry was too inclined to believe its own merchants of
doom. What it really needed was for industry leaders to become champions
of the product.
He called for more unified action by British and New Zealand producers
and marketeers to promote lamb eating overall, rather than compete for a
declining share of a declining market.

BEN Crenshaw, the US Masters champion, could put an unexpected seal on
Biggar Golf Club's centenary celebrations by being the second major
winner to visit the course this year, following Old Tom Morris . . .
Old Tom, who won the Open Championship in 1861, 1862, and 1864, may
have been pushing up daisies for 87 years, but his 'ghost'' -- in the
form of St Andrews thespian David Joy, well known as the man who plays
Tom Morris -- did turn up on the club's precise 100th birthday on June
13.
Meanwhile the real, live Crenshaw has accepted an invitation to become
an honorary member, and hopes to show up on his next visit to Scotland
in October.
The club has no direct connections with Crenshaw, unlike fellow
honorary member Sandy Lyle, who lives nearby, and honorary president Bob
Torrance, who has many friends in the area.
However, Harry Ward, co-author with his brother Alfie of the club's
newly published centenary book, explained that as Crenshaw is known for
his interest in the history of the game and its memorabilia, he
dispatched an early draft of the book, packed with the lore of an old
traditional Scottish club, along with the invitation.
Old Tom, like Torrance, had friends in the town and showed up in
person in 1901 to open the nine holes at the Heavyside district to
replace the first course at Langlees.
As reported in the centenary book, he had ''an eye still undimmed and
natural force unabated despite his full four-score years'' -- and was
presented with a walking stick. ''Just what I was needin','' he
responded, accepting the gift graciously.
David Joy, whose great-grandfather was a registered caddie with
Morris, takes two hours to make himself up as the old man, complete with
full wig and beard and every wrinkle in the right place, before
delivering his one-man show.
Biggar moved to its present location in 1907, and probably the most
significant event since has been the invitation by Clydesdale District
Council -- who run the municipal course -- to the club to take over the
lease of the new clubhouse, which they did in 1980.
That acted as a catalyst. The membership grew from 37 to 198 and today
there is a full complement of 250, with a short waiting list.
Members pay #130 for a season ticket to play the now well-modernised
5406-yard, standard-scratch 66 course plus #50-a-year club membership.
There are 42 women, who pay the reduced rate of #30. None has exercised
her constitutional right to have the same privileges as the men.
Biggar's ambitious centenary programme has also included a pro-am and
an exhibition by trick-shot specialist Noel Hunt.
The last scheduled event is a centenary match against Shotts, but Ben
Crenshaw may yet have the last word.

SCOTLAND follows many trends, one pace behind England's south coast,
and just as the 880-boat showpiece Cowes Week suffered with no wind on
Sunday and all racing there was cancelled, so Tennents West Highland
Yachting Week yesterday fell victim to the same doldrums.
Six of the eight classes endured three hours of milling around in the
tropical sunshine awaiting the arrival of the forecast 10-knot breeze to
no avail, and racing was cancelled.
Ironically, some two miles to the north of the main body of the fleet,
the two restricted sail divisions, classes 7 and 8, had a little breeze
and started their scheduled round-the-buoys inshore race.
Even their faint-hearted northerly win expired at the first turning
mark off the end of Lismore Island. The total distance travelled for
their afternoon's toil amounted to no more than a handful of miles.
While many were grateful to have had a contest at all, most will have
rued their choice of class, which forbids spinnakers, for the course was
predominantly downwind.
A computer operator error robbed William Marshall's vintage Honeybee
Crunluath of the victory they were initially credited with on the first
set of results published for Sunday' opening race.
Corrections which were made dropped them to second in Class 8 for that
passage race, but yesterday they gained some compensation by winning
their division by no less than five minutes.
In Class 7, Helensburgh's Colin Frier proved victorious in his MGC 27
Eureka, holding off past class-winner John Cowie in Joker 2. Results:
Race 2: Class 7 -- 1, Eureka (C Frier) 1hr 39min 41sec; 2, Joker 2 (J
Cowie) 1-42-22; 3, Silver Dollar (P Whalley) 1-42-40.
Class 8 -- 1, Crumluath (W Marshall) 1-35-15; 2, Mist of Malin (K
Beaumont) 1-40-42; 3, Rosanda (J and C Wilkie) 1-44-43.

called to the colours yesterday, Alan Reid and Graham Rankin, came
through the first round at Southerness
yesterday.
McKibbin was in considerable danger of having abruptly terminated the
reign which began 12 months ago at Renfrew when he was one down with
five to play against Stewart Meiklejohn, who had a short career as a
professional before the Aberdour golfer returned to the amateur ranks
and another outdoor job, that of postman.
Up to that point the play had been scrappy. Meiklejohn, an infrequent
competitor, lost balls at the first and third as he was to lose another
and with it the match. But McKibbin, who also parted company with a
ball, rose to the challenge.
The course has a particularly strong finish and McKibbin took four
holes in a row from the fourteenth, winning that and the short fifteenth
in par and the sixteenth and short seventeenth in birdies, first hitting
a No.3 iron to 15 feet and then a No.6 iron to six inches, the sight of
which induced his opponent to hook to oblivion.
The comparative remoteness of Southerness -- although it is now only
an hour from the M74 through the heaving metropolis of Dumfries -- makes
the 6566-yard course among the finest and least known links in Britain
and yet its pedigree and reputation has grown steadily since 1947 when
the club was formed.
The members had the good sense to recruit Mackenzie Ross, the
architect of Turnberry's championship Ailsa course, to make the unusual
design, which is unusual in two respects -- in its proportions and in
its course rating. Two of the five par-3s come in the last four holes,
and the par of 69 is four fewer than the standard scratch score.
In 1990 the links were ranked forty-ninth of the 50 best courses in
these islands, although like so many of its kind the beach leading to
the shimmering waters of the Solway Firth comes into play only once,
behind the twelfth green. The profusion of heather and the bunkering, as
economical as it is strategic, reinforce its defences.
None of these potential traps was able to halt the impressive progress
of two current internationalists,
Reid, last year's beaten finalist, who was one under par when he beat
local golfer David Watson on the thirteenth green, the same point at
which Simon Mackenzie concluded his match against Crail's Colin Mackay
in the same figures.
Reid, like McKibbin, has not lost all hope of one of the last two
Walker Cup team places, an achievement which would launch positively his
intended professional career.
The temperature would not have been unusual for
Graham Davidson, the young East of Scotland champion, who is attending
a Texas college. Davidson overwhelmed Scott Beattie of Moffat by 9 and
8, but still not as easily as former internationalist Wilson Bryson,
whose opponent, Peter Haggarty, failed to turn up.
Barclay Howard, the sponsors' 1994 Scottish Golfer of the Year, at
least knew his man had scratched and now he will face Allan Thomson who,
as winner and runner-up once each and also twice a semi-finalist, has
more recent experience of lasting the championship course than anyone,
but for two reasons Howard is firm favourite.
Thomson who works in the family roofing business, is more involved as
a selector than as a competitor these days and, anyway, he has thought
so little of his chances of progress that he is travelling from home,
which in Thomson's case means a 140-mile round trip from Ayr.
Wisely or not, given that he is approaching 43, Howard caddied for
Rankin through the heat and burden of the day for the 16 holes his
fellow newcomer to the Walker Cup team needed to beat Ardeer's William
Guiney. Rankin was never squared after he had hit a No.8 iron to a foot
at the sixth.
The day's only notable setback occurred in the early evening when
Roger Beames, a beaten semi-finalist in the Amateur Championship, lost 2
and 1 to Stirling's Craig Lee, winner this season of the Scottish Boys'
Strokeplay title
-- a result which can hardly have advanced the Wick golfer's senior
international team ambitions.
* HOLDER Mark Foster survived his first-round match against schoolboy
prodigy Justin Rose -- who just missed playing in last month's Open
Championship -- in the English Amateur championship at Hunstanton.
Worksop's Foster was dormie three against the 15-year-old from the
Northants club, but Rose chipped in at the fifteenth and holed a bunker
shot at the next for successive birdies. Foster, however, won with a par
at the seventeenth.
Steve Webster, the 20-year-old from Atherstone who was leading amateur
in the Open, plays his first match today.

THE computer at the Cavendish club in Derbyshire at first refused to
accept Ann May's holiday score over her one-time home course of Brodick,
writes Douglas Lowe. It was a level-par 65, equalling the course record,
and when her 11 handicap was subtracted that made a net 54.
There was a fail-safe mechanism in the programme, presumably to guard
against diabolical input errors, and the computer invited the match and
handicap secretary to double check the score, which was, indeed,
perfectly correct.
It makes Ann, who is 42 today, our bandit of the week with a good
chance of qualifying for the final at Haggs Castle, where, by
coincidence, she was a junior captain after leaving the island.
It was not, however, a totally unprecedented performance. Ann --
maiden name Cameron -- is a former under-18 and under-21 Scottish
internationalist, when she held a handicap of four. She has only
recently returned to the game after a 10-year absence to raise a family.
Her score, in the Brodick club's flag competition, equalled the mark
set more than 10 years ago by Belle Robertson in an exhibition match
with Dale Reid and the Cadden sisters from Cardross.
''I was really chuffed to play so well over the course where I learned
to play the game,'' said Ann, a probation officer.
It consisted of six birdies, six pars, and six bogeys in halves of 31
(one under) and 34 (one over), amid encouragement from marker Valerie
Gauld.
Ann's handicap has been reduced to 10 and she needs more away scores
to go lower, as she hopes to do, in order to achieve her new ambition to
play county golf for Derbyshire. This week's leading scores:

IT'S been Massie-a-go-go of late. The high-profile activity of writer
Allan Massie has included the recent publication of his new novel, the
fictional autobiography King David, a touring revival of his
biographical play of Sir Walter Scott, The Minstrel and the Shirra, and,
unusually for an established novelist whose preferred medium is the
printed word, the forthcoming opening of another new play, First Class
Passengers, at Pitlochry Festival Theatre.
It all amounts to quite a media onslaught, but Massie insists the
timing is coincidental, the tour of The Minstrel and the Shirra having
been organised by Robert Paterson, performer of the one-man show.
The final play in Pitlochry's season, First Class Passengers is set in
Perthshire, where a retired actress, Diana Lockhart-Nairn, is determined
to stage a comeback by organising friends and family in a production for
the local arts festival. It's a far cry from the fictionalisations of
historical heroic figures which Massie is famed for, from the Augustus,
Tiberius, and Caesar of his Roman trilogy, to Scott and King David. But
it was inspired by a dramatic classic, Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard.
This is the play which Lockhart-Nairn's amateur company is to perform.
Massie wisely insists he is wary of comparisons between his drama and
Chekhov's -- ''which must be to my disadvantage'' -- yet cannot resist
suggesting similarities of mood. ''There is a similar sense of loss of
direction, a similar feeling that life has slipped out of control, a
similar feeling that there must be a change, and comparable uncertainty
as to what form that change might take.
''As in Chekhov's time (and play) an inherited way of life appears to
have lost its validity, while what is to replace it seems unattractive.
The middle-aged are disillusioned and the young, finding little positive
to which they may attach themselves, are torn between a vague idealism
and a feeling that life has nothing but the pleasure of the moment to
offer . . . they know that the promise of a new dawn proved false. All
we are left with, says one bright young character, is 'sex and
fashion'.''
Massie claims that if he could only ever see one play again in his
life it would be The Cherry Orchard. So, is his play a tribute to
Chekhov's masterpiece? ''A humble tribute,'' he allows.
The title, arrived at only after the play was almost completed,
derives from an analogy one of the young characters makes, describing
the group as passengers in life who are travelling first class.
He describes his collaboration with the Pitlochry Festival Theatre as
pleasurable and reflects that he now feels inspired to write another
drama. He declares enormous respect for Perry and the company, saying
somewhat wryly: ''I've come to the slightly unhappy conclusion that if
the play fails it will be the fault of the play and not of the director
of the company.''

A FIVE-YEAR-OLD grey mare shown by Claire Edgar from Carrutherstown,
Annan, won the supreme championship at the Moniaive Horse Show.
What Not won the champion hunter section and then went on to win her
first ever supreme title.
Claire is a well known exhibitor and rider in the championship rings,
having taking part and won major championships at local shows and events
as well as Scottish and British championships.
Placed reserve Scotland was Dene Fire Falcon, an eight-year-old fell
pony stallion which is standing at stud at Dalmakerran, Tynron. The
stallion, owned by Debbie Wicks, was making his once-yearly outing at
Moniaive.
A new trophy which was donated and competed for this year was the Mrs
E Martin Memorial Trophy, and it was fitting that a relative, Mr Murray
Martin of Barjarg, Auldgirth, collected it with his foal.
Entries for the show were similar to last year and organisers were
delighted with the support and turnout of horses and spectators.
The trophy winners were:
Anderson Trophy for family pony -- Lorna Mundell, Kirkgunzeon; Douglas
Trophy -- Mrs Margaret Hunt, Maryfield, Terregles; Moniaive Horse Show
Trophy -- Jimmy
Martin, Dumfries.
Hunt Trophy -- Mrs J Rennie, Garnie Cottage, Gatehouse of Fleet;
Dumfries Tack Shop Trophy for leading rein and riding ponies -- Susan
Hunt, Maryfield, Terregles.
Mrs E Martin Memorial Trophy -- Murray Martin, Barjarg, Auldgirth;
Millgan Trophy -- Man Moore, Johnstonebridge; Drumcork Trophy -- A W &amp; W
J Rae, Dalswinton.
Glencairn Trophy -- Claire Edgar, Carrutherstown; Robert Weir Trophy
-- Debbie Wicks, Dalmakerran, Tynron; Showjumping Trophy -- Shirley,
Bissett, Thornhill.
Dardarroch Trophy for handy horse or pony ; Supreme champion silver
cup and sash of honour -- Claire Edgar; Reserve champion silver cup --
Debbie Wicks.

THE narrow measure of the money supply continued to grow robustly last
month, figures from the Bank of England showed yesterday.
M0, which measures notes and coins in circulation and bankers'
balances, increased by 0.7% in July, and the annual rate of growth was
unchanged at 5.7% -- well above the upper limit of its 0% to 4%
monitoring range.
Notes and coins on their own, the more meaningful constituent, rose by
0.6% and the annual rate accelerated from 5.9% to 6.1%.
The three month annualised rate for notes and coins was 7.1% -- the
third consecutive month that it had been above 7%.
The figures are the first hard data for the third quarter, and as such
are encouraging for the economy, which has slowed down but is still
growing at just above its trend rate of 2.25% per annum.
Strong M0 figures would normally raise hopes of healthy retail sales
figures, but the month-by-month connection between narrow money and
sales volumes is not close.
In recent months, retail sales have been lack lustre, despite robust
growth in notes and coins in circulation. This has puzzled economists.
The best explanation they can offer is that consumer spending outside
retail sales on the likes of the National Lottery is strong.
James Capel's Adam Cole said that yesterday's figures had few policy
implications. The money supply has slipped well down the Bank of
England's list of worries on inflation.
The quarterly inflation report tomorrow is expected to show that the
Bank would still like to see higher interest rates. It is worried about
the inflationary impact of sterling's fall from grace this year and the
above-trend growth in activity.
''It will take several months of hard economic data showing the
economy rebounding in the second half of the year before the Chancellor
(of the Exchequer) will be prepared to concede,'' Cole said.
Kenneth Clarke and Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank, have been
at odds on rates since May.

WHAT a lot of ''male'' plays there are around at present. If it's not
the gay boys bonding in the military and Kentish Town and 1950s Soho,
now even the straight lads in eighteenth-century Germany are getting in
on the act. Schiller's sardonically theatrical The Robbers -- the play
with which, as a 23-year-old military doctor, he first made his name --
is given thrusting modernity in Lindsay Posner's pounding and
atmospheric corridor production and Robert David MacDonald's wily new
translation.
Resentment is its key word, abuse it's second -- the kind of abuse of
male power unleashed in Rwanda or Bosnia but mixed here with individual
questioning that Camus's twentieth-century existential anti-heroes would
have understood only too well. When self-disgust and scepticism of a
dank and dirty world reaches such a pitch Schiller's two contrasting
brothers conclude the only solution is to defy eternal damnation and lay
seige to life.
Riven with Shakespearean echoes, Schiller's villainous, double-dealing
second son, Franz, is a vivid contrast with the conscience-stricken
Hamlet/Karl, the elder, more beloved brother driven just as deeply by a
sense of familial rejection. Schiller was on to something when he
recognised personal disappointment as the motivating force behind
political action.
With little room for women (though Carol Stark's Amaia conveys
consummate goodness and loyalty with touching sincerity), this ''sturm
und drang'' boy's night is given a definitively northern edge by James
Mair's Scottish Karl and Alastair Galbraith's Spiegelberg, a robber with
all the rancorous, fidgety energy of a John Byrne Slab Boy.

Performances at the Edinburgh Festival have always had their highs and
lows. This year The Herald is sponsoring special awards to mark both
triumph and tragedy, as Keith Bruce reveals
INSIDE a workshop at the port of Granton the resin is setting in the
mould of two new icons of the Scottish art world. The Herald Angel is an
imposing statuette, a gilded be-winged figure on a polished elm plinth,
an eloquent witness to the soaring performance of its recipient that
will soon become a talisman to the thousands who parade their dreams at
the Edinburgh Festival, its Fringe and its sister festivals.
In contrast, the Little Devil is less a fallen angel than a
fallen-over angel -- a figure of mischief rather than malice. Coal black
and dumpy, he will be granted to those on whom fortune has snarled, in
recognition of their fortitude.
Admittedly, Edinburgh's festivals are already awash with awards.
Student theatre companies vie for one sponsored by a London newspaper.
Stand-up comics chase the fizzy water one. Animators hope to be
recognised by the Post Office. The Herald Angels -- which have received
the blessing of Prince Edward -- make no such distinctions.
At the end of each week of this year's festival The Herald will
present two of these covetable figurines to examples of Edinburgh
excellence over the previous seven days.
There are no rules about who may embrace an angel -- the only
qualification is that their work has impressed The Herald's team of
writers and reviewers, whether in the ''official'' Festival or the
Fringe; in an art exhibition; in film and book festivals. They may go to
an individual, a group, an organisation, a venue. For Edinburgh's newest
and most comprehensive award, anything is possible.
Yet for every glittering success story, the world's biggest arts
festival always has a parallel tale of woe. Two Little Devils will be
awarded as a consolation prize to those for whom the fates have not been
so kind. The Little Devil is an acknowledgement of a terrible reality:
if things can go wrong, they will.
Examples? The opera which failed to start because a principal singer
had fallen asleep in his hotel room. Last year's crucially-timed failure
of a cinema-projector which blacked out the screening of award-winners.
The naked landlord who refused to leave the living-room he'd leased to a
Glasgow theatre company as a dormitory for their actresses. The power
failure, minutes before the first night; the fire-proofed floorcloth
that spontaneously combusts; the leading lady who loses her voice -- a
Little Devil recognises the problems and the sacrifices.
Both the Herald Angels and the Little Devils have been designed and
made by sculptor Allan Ross. He is only too familiar with the joys and
trials of the performing, his fiddle-playing having featured in plays
such as 7:84's The Cheviot, The Stag, and The Black, Black Oil and
Wildcat's The Silver Darlings.
Ross also worked as a theatre designer on Border Warfare and John
Brown's Body, and plays the fiddle regularly on the Edinburgh folk
scene. As well as making The Herald's Angels and Devils, he is currently
working on an installation for an Edinburgh park on a larger scale -- a
giant footprint 90ft by 30ft.

RECENT baking temperatures have hit sales at Greggs bakery group, the
company reported yesterday.
''As in 1994, the very hot weather across the UK has made for a slow
start to our second half,'' the company said.
The current trading picture accompanied results for the 24 weeks to
June 17 which were much brighter, showing taxable profits ahead by #1.1m
to #4.1m.
The Newcastle-based group is paying investors an interim dividend a
penny higher at 8p on earnings per share of 23.3p against 21.4p.
Sales of #96.6m were 86% higher than in the previous first half
because of the acquisition of the 424 Baker's Oven shops last summer
from Associated British Foods.
Since the middle of June, Greggs has bought 13 Pork Farms shops in the
East Midlands, and Olivers, most of whose bakery-related stores are in
Scotland.

NEW-look stores costing #167m are helping draw in a larger number of
customers to the Somerfield, Food Giant and Gateway chain. In the year
to April, sales rose 6% to #3156m, with the modernised units seeing
revenue improving by 14% on average.
However, the intensity of competition has resulted in operating
margins declining slightly from 2.12% to 2.06% to leave operating
profits virtually unchanged at #64.9m.
Likewise, pre-tax profits were little altered at #33m, although the
latest result included a #4m gain on property sales so that the pre-tax
margin was just 0.92%.
The group saw a reduction in store numbers from 645 to 618 units, with
over half still trading under names other than Somerfield or Food Giant,
although another 100 will be changed in the current financial year to
next April.
Happily, an increasing number of suppliers are prepared to grant
credit rather than demand cash on delivery.
The company, which is a fully owned subsidiary of Isosceles, has
exceeded its budget in the first 12 weeks.
However, it is widely regarded as being the most vulnerable of the
larger supermarket groups to any prolonged period of widespread
price-cutting by the industry majors.

MARK FISHER meets the creators of a musical on Scot John Paul Jones
who became an American folk hero
We were really quite worried about how our different styles would
combine
WHILE the rest of the theatre industry sinks ever deeper into its
summer slumber, Scottish Youth Theatre is valiantly banging the dramatic
drum in the centre of Glasgow. The 130 young people aged 12 to 21 taking
part in SYT's nineteenth annual summer festival have already been seen
turning their hands to a spot of street theatre outside the company's
Buchanan Street base at the Old Athenaeum. And this week they're showing
off the results of their intensive five-week rehearsals in three
separate productions.
Last night one team of young actors, musicians, and stage managers
from throughout Scotland opened a production of Shakespeare's Twelfth
Night in the darkest depths of the city's Arches Theatre. Tomorrow
another group heads out to Cumbernauld Theatre to stage Stuart
Paterson's literate fairy story, The Princess and the Goblin, a play
that makes a welcome appearance outwith the pantomime season. It is
directed by Raymond Short, himself a former summer festival participant.
Most ambitious of all is the show opening tonight in the Old
Athenaeum. It is a large-scale spectacular which the creators believe to
be the first all-new musical to come out of Scotland in a decade.
Retelling the story of a Scot who became an American folk hero after he
changed allegiance and fought against the British in the War of
Independence, John Paul Jones is the result of a happy first-time
collaboration between young Scottish playwrights Stuart Thomas, best
known for his work with his own Take Two Productions, and Lara Jane
Bunting, whose plays have been seen everywhere from Mull to Musselburgh.
Meeting them together you immediately get the sense of a productive,
sympathetic, and creative working relationship. The pair are fortunate
in preferring a similar working pattern. They both thrive on a deadline
and tend to end up writing quickly in all-night sessions rather than
linger round waiting for the artistic muse to strike.
''We were quite worried about how our different styles would
combine,'' says Bunting, who likes the lyrical where Thomas opts for the
quick laugh. ''So we decided to use the character of John Paul Jones's
sister to give it a balance.
''It suited us because I was able to do most of the sister scenes and
Stuart followed John Paul Jones's life.''
''I found it really good having another writer there all the time,''
says Thomas who has written all the songs for the show and is also
musical director. ''We always read what the other had written and we'd
then put our own input into it.''
The typical working life of a playwright is a solitary one. It's a job
that involves learning slowly by your own mistakes, providing little
opportunity to learn from others. This set up, however, has given each
playwright a real practical understanding about the way the other
tackles problems, and both are convinced that it will benefit their solo
work in future.
''I've learned from Stuart that you can write big scenes and make them
camp, make them funny, make them outrageous,'' says Bunting.
''And what I've learned from Lara,'' says Thomas, ''is that everything
doesn't need to have a laugh line at the end of it. When you're writing
on your own there's always a fear of following your instinct in case you
get indulgent -- you don't know how far to take it. But when someone
else is there, you feel supported.''
One of the impulses behind the project is to address the fact that so
few homegrown musicals are produced in Scotland. There are a couple of
small companies -- namely Edinburgh's First Base and Thomas's own Take
Two Productions -- that are dedicated to musical theatre, but most of
their output has drawn on existing songs and not original compositions.
For SYT to generate its own musical -- one in which a large cast can
get involved -- is the beginning of a solution to the artistic deadlock.
''There's a lack of Scottish musicals,'' explains Thomas. ''And this
is truly Scottish -- we're Scottish, the cast are all Scottish, and the
hero is Scottish and that's not usual.''
1 The events of John Paul Jones's itinerant life -- in Russia, France,
Jamaica, Scotland, and America -- created a natural dramatic shape that
made coming up with a plot the easiest part. And many of those events,
says Thomas, were crying out for musical treatment. ''There are so many
set pieces that are just there for you,'' he says. ''For example, he was
in Paris at the time of the French Revolution . . . there's the Imperial
Court of Queen Catherine . . . there's all these ships, and there's a
funeral. You couldn't not make it a musical.
''One of the strengths of youth theatre is that it gives us so much
scope -- there's a section at the beginning where they sing a lament and
because they're all so good and because there's so many of them,
drowning in all these lovely young voices, it's really moving.''

Washington, Monday
THE Mighty Mouse has bought itself some air time. Walt Disney is
buying America's leading television network, ABC, for $19bn. When the
merger is finished, the new company will be by far the biggest and most
powerful television company in the world.
This has been a good month for Disney: its theme park near Paris has
at last turned a profit and the latest cartoon movie, ''Pocahontas'', is
going well.
Good times are here for ABC, too. One of its rivals, CBS, has been
stripped to the bone by a financial manipulator, who has put the
decaying remnants on the block. Disney thought of buying it, but ABC is
far more attractive.
What is more, the new Republican Congress is busy cutting away various
restrictions on the networks, including one limiting the number of local
stations they can own. ABC will buy another two in August, giving it
eight, and no doubt it will buy more in months to come, using money from
the Magic Mountain.
Disney owns the Disney Channel and ABC owns 80% of the sports channel,
ESPN -- both on cable -- and ABC has interests in other cable channels.
It is not an international media empire like Rupert Murdoch's News
Inc, or the second-ranking US TV network, NBC, but it is quite possible
that it will now plunge off in that direction.

AMID the many true-life confessions with which Mr Morton creased us
mightily on Sunday night, the one about the helicopter was the most
shocking. Get this: our city's premier observer of la vie gallus et
Gallowgatienne has a long-term plan to chuck stand-up in order to become
a full-time sky-jockey, piloting helicopters!
On the evidence of Sunday's pre-Edfest try-out, aviation's gain would
be laughter-mongering's loss. Despite betraying a certain pre-Edinburgh
shapelessness, Bruce's show was distinguished by its creator's usual
acutely-truthful observations of street-life in post-industrial Glasgow.
He led us to ponder the everyday surrealism of being a lizard-keeper
in Possil; noted some of the politically-correct absurdities of life in
the West End, and provided handy tips on a) trumping proprietorial
Glasgow taxi-drivers and b) surviving queues for the lavvy at parties in
Partick.
Additionally, Bruce trained his sights on such universal topics as
door-to-door vendors of religion; telephone salespersons; teenage sexual
guilt; male sexual inadequacy; female sexual inadequacy, and all-round
human inadequacy.
Throughout, Bruce's matey mastery of the art of comedic performance
was more than adequate. To see him is to be amused and diverted by him.
Don't forsake this rare talent, Bruce

THE first of three plays which conclude the Scottish Youth Theatre's
Summer Festival, this production of Shakespeare's comedy is truly
captivating. Designer David Carter has created a delightful rose-strewn
illyria in The Arches back arch, and the fantastical elements of this
island of love are further emphasised in extravagant costumes, ablaze
with colour. Director Mary McCluskey extracts the full potential of the
in-the-round performance keeping her young talented cast constantly on
their toes with plenty of movement, including some deadly comic sword
fights, and spirited dance sequences.
It's a full-blooded production with an emphasis on the humour rather
than the love-at-first-sight romances.
The hilarious characterisations of Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Sir Toby
Belch, and the unfortunate Malvolio are brilliantly realised -- Paul
Austin's Aguecheek had me in tears of laughter and McCluskey allows even
the most minor characters, the gentlemen and gentlewomen of Orsino and
Olivia's households, to revel in comic nuance, with much nudge-nudge
winkery puntuating the play at appropriate moments.
McCluskey's innovations, creating more parts for her company by giving
Feste a silent shadow and having two Marias and two Fabians, work well.
Turning Antonio into Antonia was perhaps over-clarifying the dodgy
passion between the sea captain and Sebastian but a fine, feisty
performance by Claire McDaid carried it off.
The musical interludes, led by Thomas Mullins as a strong-voiced Feste
enhanced the atmosphere and certainly fed the love. A production of
verve and charm featuring excellent performances, this is a perfect
summer evening's entertainment.

PRINTED circuit board manufacturer Prestwick Holdings yesterday took
another step along the path back to the Ordinary dividend list, when its
directors declared their intention to clear Preference arrears in
November, writes IAN McCONNELL.
In December last year, Prestwick Holdings obtained High Court approval
to eliminate the deficit on its distributable reserves, run up while the
company was making losses, so that it could restore the payment of
dividends out of current profits.
Including the Preference dividend due yesterday, arrears currently
total about #535,000, which is equivalent to five half-yearly payouts.
Although the proposed clearance of Preference arrears on November 17
is dependent upon ''sufficient distributable reserves'', the directors
will already have a good idea of results for the 12 months to yesterday.
There is therefore little doubt that the bottom-line earnings figure,
which the company will announce on September 28, will exceed #535,000.
Preference dividend arrears must, by law, be paid before Prestwick
Holdings can consider payouts on Ordinary shares.
It is not clear whether Prestwick Holdings, which primarily supplies
the automotive industry, will pay an Ordinary dividend for the year to
end-July next year. The company may, instead, consider it prudent to
have a breathing space.
With executive chairman and company doctor Archie Coulson having
arrived last year, Prestwick Holdings turned an interim loss of #1.95m
into a pre-tax profit of #411,000 in the six months to January 29.
The company, which also makes circuit boards for mobile telephones,
computers, and industrial uses, is investing heavily in plant and has
increased its workforce in recent months. It now employs more than 600
people.
However, director Alastair McKie said: ''The company's prime objective
is to be able to restore Ordinary dividends. Until it has done that, it
can't seriously claim that it has completely recovered.''
* HARRY Wills, until recently managing director of the Swedish-owned
Robert Fleming paper and packaging group in Dundee, is becoming MD of
the Glasgow-based offset litho printer Wace Clark.
Part of the Wace Group, Wace Clark specialises in corporate and
promotional literature and packaging for the Scottish drinks industry.
Wills joined the business on July 1.

THE slowdown in manufacturing output reported by manufacturing
industry in general is reflected in the latest July survey covering
small firms from the CBI and chartered accountants Pannell Kerr Forster.
It also shows that the slowdown in output is accompanied by a fall in
the growth of overall demand, which rose at its lowest rate since April
1994.
Small firms says that new export orders continued to rise strongly,
although the increase over the past four months was the smallest since
last October. Over the months ahead, export orders are expected to
pick-up further.
Ian Grant, Tax Partner at Pannell Kerr Forster Edinburgh, commented:
''This survey shows the importance of export orders for small firms.
Although export growth has eased slightly, the trend remains firmly
upward and should contribute to keeping the sector relatively buoyant.
''In our experience, small firms in Scotland rely on the support
provided by the Enterprise Companies. We believe that an extension in
these services would be of great value to these companies.
''Company formations in Scotland in the first five months of this year
have seen a further increase of 5.7% over the same period last year,
which compares favourably with our English counterparts.''
The survey shows that small firms still expect to increase investment
in plant and machinery over the year ahead compared with the past 12
months, although they expect to cut back on investment in building
slightly.
Average domestic prices rose more slowly over the last quarter than in
the preceding four months, with a further slowdown expected in the next
four months. Average unit costs, however, rose at the same rate as in
the four months to April -- which was the largest rise since October
1990. This implies a further squeeze on margins.
Business optimism among small firms is levelling off; with a balance
of plus one saying they were more optimistic about their general
business situation than in the April survey. This represents the lowest
rise for 2[1/2] years.
One small firm that took part in the survey is Glasgow-based Begg
Cousland &amp; Co, a company which exports 80% of its pollution control
products.
Due to the long lead time that exists in the market in which Begg
Cousland operates, changes in the economy do not have an immediate
impact on the business. The company says: ''Export volumes continue to
grow while domestic sales remain static and below the norm.
''Several projects the company has tendered for have been held up. No
growth in employment is expected, but we will be looking to improve
training through in-house training.''

IN memory of Sir Alexander Gibson, last night's concert by the
National Youth Orchestra of Scotland testified to our enviable quality
of music education, bringing an orchestra of under 22-year-olds
dangerously close to professional standards.
Centre stage was Dave Heath's African Sunrise -- Manhattan Rave, a
showcase for percussionist Evelyn Glennie and an opportunity for NYOS to
perform something new. Heath's inspiration came from witnessing Glennie
behind a drumkit and the resulting work combines kit, marimba, and
orchestra with startling effect.
African Sunrise opens with hazy shimmers from marimba shaded by the
natural sounds of wind and water machines. Occasional rays of sunshine
from the trumpet penetrate the mist until the final splendour of the
sunset is revealed in gloriously warm textures throughout the sections.
Bird calls signal the end of sunrise and the call to party in the
aural orgy which constitutes a Manhattan Rave. Self-confessed rock chick
Glennie sat behind her drumkit and went completely off her rocker
pounding infectious rhythms over a hypnotic curtain of ''sampled''
orchestral sounds. Penultimately reaching sheer abandonment in a frenzy
of percussive mayhem, echoes of the African Sunrise return for a gentle
cool-down. And not a tab of ecstasy in sight.
A sensational Sibelius 1, from the earthy andantes through a frosty
scherzo to the tempestuous finale, confirmed the wealth of talent
growing in Scotland. Sir Alexander Gibson would have clapped till his
hands were sore.

ON the face of it, Hanson's agreed #2500m takeover bid for Eastern,
the second largest of the 12 regional electricity companies in England
and Wales, looks like encouraging and timely news for ScottishPower's
expansionist ambitions south of the Border.
Last Monday the larger of our two Scottish power utilities launched an
unwelcome bid for Manweb, a smaller fish in the pool of 12 southern
distribution and supply companies. Manweb's board says it will fight
what it has dubbed a mean offer.
The willingness of Eastern's relatively highly rated management to
yield so readily to Lord Hanson's well-practised embrace does two
things. It muddies the waters on the argument about the importance of
recs (regional electricity companies) retaining their independence. And
it sets a benchmark price against which all other offers in the sector,
friendly or hostile, can now be judged.
Hanson is willing to pay a bit more for Eastern than ScottishPower is
so far prepared to shell out for Manweb. In the world of corporate
takeovers, there is always a premium to be paid for securing your prey's
consent to the deed.
But Hanson has also targeted an expansionist-minded utility with
decent management. Manweb, by contrast, has stuck to its core knitting
-- turning its back, for example, on the opportunity to get into power
generation in a small way -- and is currently charging its customers the
second-highest tariff in the UK.
Not that Eastern is any corporate shooting star. On one independent
analysis I saw last week of all 17 UK power utilities, Manweb was bottom
of the league on the weighted average of three key indicators. Eastern
was third bottom. ScottishPower, incidentally, sat right at the top.
So confirmation of the Hanson/Eastern deal may have caused a quiet
ripple of satisfaction around ScottishPower's Atlantic Quay corporate
headquarters in central Glasgow yesterday. Certainly the stock market,
which marked Manweb's shares lower, even further adrift of
ScottishPower's offer, is saying the Scots are poised to succeed.
But all the above begs the really crucial question: what view are the
regulatory and competition authorities -- and, in the final analysis,
the new president of the Board of Trade Ian Lang -- going to adopt to
the current wave of bid fever gripping the sector?
With three bids now on the table and a fourth -- Trafalgar's revived
offer for Northern -- thought to be imminent, Opposition parties, led by
Labour's Brian Wilson, are demanding a bid-by-bid investigation by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission to stamp out what Wilson has dubbed a
casino mentality.
Last week the electricity industry regulator Professor Stephen
Littlechild seemed to be hinting, in his own consultation document on
the ScottishPower bid, that he too would like to see the MMC intervene,
albeit for less colourful reasons.
In the Manweb case, Littlechild appears concerned about the extension
of vertical integration -- the concentration of everything from power
generation to household supply in one company -- to the English
market-place. Like a true bureaucrat, he is also bothered about takeover
activity reducing the number of companies, making it harder for him to
compare performance and carry out his regulatory role.
The predators, unsurprisingly, see no need for the MMC to waste its
time in this way. ScottishPower, for example, points out that Professor
Littlechild is already allowing limited vertical integration among the
English recs, by giving them ceilings on how much generating capacity
they can develop in-house.
ScottishPower is also promising that, if it wins control of Manweb, it
will retain the distribution and supply company as a discrete entity,
holding its own licences and producing all the transparently separate
numbers Professor Littlechild needs to go on doing his job.
On any anti-competitive concentration of market share, normally the
principal concern of any MMC inquiry, ScottishPower points out that its
current share of the grid interconnector gives it around 1% of the
English pool. That amounts to a third of the share currently enjoyed by
France's cross-Channel nuclear exports.
In addition ScottishPower has around 3.6% of the competitive supply
market, covering larger industrial and commercial users, in the south.
These are not the kind of numbers which would normally set off the alarm
bells at the MMC. If Scottish &amp; Newcastle can become the largest brewer
of beer in the UK, through its acquisition of Courage, without an MMC
investigation, there seems little logical reason why any of the
electricity bids should be referred on market-share grounds.
The trouble is that logic is only a bit player in the emerging system
of regulation of our privatised utilities. When the script for that
great Thatcher adventure -- selling off state assets to the public --
was written in the 1980s, the emphasis was all on ensuring the buyers
got a bargain, while reassuring consumers that a system of price
regulation and golden shares would protect their interests too. No-one
then was too bothered about what would happen when these sectors
matured, golden shares expired, and companies started trying to take
each other over.
Even the MMC is caught up in the uncertainty. Last week it told the
French group Lyonnaise des Eaux it would block its proposed bid for
Northumbrian Water unless the bidder guarantees cuts of up to 20% in
customers' water bills as a sweetner.
The MMC seized on the implications of that bid -- the French already
own North West Water next door -- for the regulator's ability to compare
prices and maintain competition. That is precisely the point being
pushed, in the ScottishPower case, by Professor Littlechild.
But the hard bargain it has presented to Lyonnaise des Eaux -- and
which, on the grounds of consistency alone, it might try on the various
electricity bidders -- marks a significant evolution in its role as
defender of corporate competition.
It is an inevitable change, perhaps, given the emergence of a new
breed of price-regulated, privatised utilities. But it is a change which
ought to be publicly debated. Over to you Mr Lang. What's the view from
Victoria Street?

THIS week a huge new car ferry, the Isle of Lewis, assumes Caledonian
MacBrayne's service from Ullapool to Stornoway. In such an island as
Lewis, with its long tradition of matters marine, such change marks an
era in island history. When the new boat arrived last week, Stornoway
ground to gridlock as islanders drove in to goggle at the vessel. Now,
belatedly, tears are shed for the 21-year-old Suilven, shortly to sail
for New Zealand.
The Suilven was latterly unpopular; slow, cramped, and grubby. Yet
there is a notorious tradition for Stornoway ferries. The new boat
arrives, is heaped in praise, and then the mob wheels to scorn and
complain. I am just old enough to remember the delight with which the
Suilven was greeted in August 1974, when she replaced the unhappy
Clansman after that vessel's service of barely a year. But the Clansman
in turn had been hailed with joy after the sickening Iona. And the Iona,
which opened the Ullapool-Stornoway service in 1973, had in turn come as
a relief after the elderly Loch Seaforth . . . and so on, and so on.
The Isle of Lewis will have a pleasant honeymoon with the islanders.
For some months they will do nothing but coo in her vast lounges and
thrill to her 18 knots. But it will not be long, I doubt, before the
novelty wears and the complaints begin. The Suilven, inadequate as she
proved, was a sturdy seaboat on CalMac's most exposed service. The new
ferry, big and fat as she is, is likely to prove unpleasant in heavy
weather.
That, however, is not at all the same thing as being unsafe, and it is
irritating to see the arrival of the Isle of Lewis provoking media
frenzy over the safety of drive-through vehicle ferries.
In the Outer Isles and the West Highlands as a whole, car ferries are
our lifeline. And the drive-through design -- a full-length car-deck,
stern ramp at one end and bow visor and ramp at the other -- has long
been established as the best for car and haulage traffic. Our first
car-ferries were of the hoist-loading type, like the Arran of 1954 or
the much-loved Hebrides of a decade later. These loaded vehicles, four
or five at a time, by means of a lift and side ramps. But, at extremes
of tide, this was very slow. The power of the hoist limited weight; the
beam of the ship restricted vehicle length. By 1970 the Arran and the
Hebrides were already obsolete.
Caledonian MacBrayne moved -- with much difficulty; funds were short
and different services competed for the best new ferries -- to full
drive-through operation, converting their last major route only in 1994.
Hoist loading is now history; all new ferries can carry vehicles of
maximum weight and length permitted on British roads, and by faster
loading more crossings can be fitted into a daily schedule. Some shorter
CalMac crossings are still operated by little bow-loading ferries; but,
since 1978, every single vessel built by CalMac has been of
drive-through type.
The nervous argue that this design is intrinsically unsafe. The long
enclosed car-deck is a void space, they say, on which flooding water can
swirl and rock, tilting the ferry's centre of gravity and capsizing her.
And they point, of course, to three notorious disasters -- the loss of
the Stranraer steamer, Princess Victoria, in 1953; the Herald of Free
Enterprise calamity in 1987, and the recent Estonia tragedy.
But the Princess Victoria was a stern-loading ferry whose doors opened
inward -- an arrangement now unthinkable -- and was lost in a freak
storm of the kind only known once or twice a century. The Herald of Free
Enterprise set sail with her bow doors open; these were of the
''clamshell'' type, opening sideways, and none of CalMac's boats has
this feature. It is still unclear what sank the Estonia.
Caledonian MacBrayne have, in fact, never lost passenger life through
sinking or shipwreck -- a remarkable claim for a company in operation
since 1851. That is a tribute to the skill of company seaman and also to
the innate caution of Highland mariners: no Hebridean skipper would have
left port in such conditions as sank the Princess Victoria. But it is
also a tribute to the sensible design of CalMac's ferries.
None is as obscenely top-heavy as the ugly floating hotels crossing
the Channel, with tier upon tier of passenger accommodation and minimal
open deck space. (The design of the Herald of Free Enterprise, her
passenger decks enclosed from beam to beam, contributed to the high
casualties.) And, apart from CalMac's three most massive ferries, major
ships have the vehicle deck open at the stern, greatly reducing the
danger of trapped flood water.
A case might be made, I suppose, for installing ''baffles,'' such as
vertical bulkheads or doors, throughout the length of car deck on a
drive-through ferry. But such a feature is best kept for vessels to
come. The cost of modifying existing ships would be prohibitive. It
would also greatly reduce vehicle capacity and threaten the economic
viability of key CalMac operations.
CalMac's own history too, doesn't encourage massive modification to
car ferries. Denied adequate capital for new ships in the early
seventies, several older vessels were hastily altered for end-loading
service. In 1973, for instance, the hoist-loading Clansman, earmarked
for the Stornoway run, was converted to drive-through operation at huge
expense. The conversion was not a success and she was sold, prematurely
aged, in 1984.
In the wake of the Herald of Free Enterprise tragedy, many changes
have already been enforced in ferry design. Companies already wrestle
with dozens of new regulations. But that catastrophe was, in its
origins, as much the fruit of bad operating practices as of faulty
design.
Too many ferry companies still man boats with overworked and underpaid
crewmen, working inhumanly long shifts, often inadequately trained. This
is an issue which our MPs might profitably address. In the meantime they
should damp down this midsummer madness, and spare us their unoriginal
opinions on naval architecture.

YOU don't hear much about Mr Major's egalitarian society these days
but, like much else, no sooner had he intoned the goal of classlessness
than it withered and dropped right off the Prime Ministerial agenda. Of
course, class is so entrenched in British genes it would require
intensive NHS treatment to remove it, and anyway, as any etiquette
scholar would argue, there is no snob like the one who aspires to be
classless.
But consider that case, last week, of the warring neighbours in
Wootton Road. It might have happened in deepest Bedfordshire, but one
man regarding another as ''common'' sets off reverberations right
through the whole of England.
The feud between a retired company director and a former dealer in
used cars began, in bristling territorial tradition, with a garden
fence.
When Alan Kingston and his wife moved into Number 59 their neighbours,
the Wards at Number 57, replaced the chain-link fence between the two
properties with a wooden-slatted construction -- a gesture the Kingstons
found offensive. On the Wards' return from holiday they found the new
fence uprooted in their garden, and over the next three years there
followed charge and counter-charge between the families, the Wards
complaining to the planning authorities about the Kingstons littering
the street with second-hand cars; the Kingstons calling Ward a liar and
a fraud, and accusing him of involvement in the disappearance of their
daughter's Jack Russell terrier.
But the day when Wootton Road's decorum was utterly undone occurred
one Sunday during a lunch party at Number 57. As guests left the Wards
they were confronted by a rash of libelous posters proclaiming, among
other things, that Ward was a lying bankrupt and a conman. All the
notices were stuck on the Kingstons' fleet of cars, but earlier stickers
of similar neighbourly sentiment had been plastered on village
lamp-posts and telegraph poles, postboxes and bus timetables. Say what
you like about the Home Counties' idyll, its narrow anger and passion
remain spry as a nest of wasps.
In court last week it was alleged that the bad feeling between the two
families had reached such boiling temperature the Kingstons had
threatened to dig up the remains of the Wards' son who had been killed
in a car crash in 1979. Kingston, in turn, complained that Ward had
acted like a dictator, issuing orders about getting the grass cut and
the windows cleaned. Worse still, perhaps, Ward was a name-dropper,
informing his wayward neighbour that he was a pal of the chief constable
and played golf with Bedfordshire's High Sheriff.
It was perfectly plain to the Kingstons that they were considered
common. However, their retaliatory vendetta has cost them #1000 in
damages. Yet from both viewpoints this story confirms the Englishman's
unassailable belief that his home is his castle. In Scotland the
obsession with property is less entrenched, but in England lawyers will
tell you that most of their work concerns claims of harassment between
neighbours.
In this case even the judge, Sir Michael Davies described the affair
as a ''commonplace, straightforward village dispute''.
But how do we define the word common today? A lack of public
refinement is still the best interpretation although there is now a more
pronounced difference between commonness and vulgarity. To pick your
ears with your car keys is being common. To winkle away at your teeth
with a gold toothpick is vulgar. And where does this leave gentility?
Gentility is clutching your skirts about you, fearing offence from
lesser mortals. It is egotism on the sly, smug and righteous, timid yet
passively bullying, and not in any way to be confused with being well-
mannered.
What is so quintessentially English about the tale of Wootton Road,
however, is its red-in-tooth-and- claw paganism. Here, with a swish of
the curtain, are the violent embolisms which so easily dominate English
village life; the comic indignities which erupt beneath the smooth skin
of asmiling landscape.
Here are busybody hatreds and in-comer rancour. It could be Alan
Ayckbourn or Agatha Christie. It could be Ruth Rendell or William
Trevor, where nothing at allis as it seems, and the murder weapon is
that hanging basket beside the cottage door.

<HEADLINE>Bid values electricity company at #2500m. Hanson gets Eastern promise</HEADLINE>

THE Anglo-American conglomerate Hanson has made its long-awaited bid
for one of the regional electricity companies. Yesterday it offered to
pay 975p per share in an agreed bid for Eastern Group valuing the
company at #2500m. There is a loan note alternative.
Shareholders can look forward to healthy profits on their investment.
The shares closed at 700p last Friday, so the bid represents a premium
of 39%. Yesterday, Eastern's shares jumped 209p to 909p awaiting a
possible monopolies referral. Its shareholders remain eligible for the
final dividend of 20.05p net per Eastern share, payable on 2 October.
Commenting on the agreed bid, something which is not unusual for
Hanson, Lord Hanson said the full offer price ''takes into account
Eastern's strength as the largest regional electricity company, its
potential and its proven ability to expand further outside its limited
regulated regional electricity dsitribution business''.
James Smith, chairman of Eastern, said the group welcomed ''this
strategic and financial partnership, which will enable Eastern and our
management to reach our full potential as an integrated energy
company''. John Devaney, chief executive of Eastern has been invited to
become executive chairman of eastern upon the offer becoming wholly
unconditional.
Of all the RECs Eastern is the one most suited to be a part of Hanson.
In recent times Eastern has been downplaying the importance of its
distribution business, although it still accounts for the vast majority
of profits, 82%, preferring to focus on its developing integrated energy
business of electricity supply, generation and gas.
Eastern, whose geographic territory covers the south and east of
England including north London, made pre-tax profits of #203.5m last
year on turnover of just over #2000m. Its net assets were #831.1m. As
well as being the largest electricity distributor in England and wales,
Eastern is also the biggest electricity supplier in the UK with 14.5%
market share.
In addition, it has growing power generation interests and is keen to
grow its gas business on the back of next year's deregulation of the
domestic market. There is a #45m electrical contracting business. Its
electrical retailing interests are part of the loss-making Powerhouse
joint venture with Southern and Midlands Electricity which is up for
sale.
Eastern hopes to be making 45% of its profits from non core,
unregulated, businesses by the year 2000. It is this aggressive growth
strategy which attracted Hanson. Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson
and heir apparent to Lord Hanson, sees scope for Eastern to work on Far
Eastern power generation projects with Peabody, Hanson's US coal mining
business.
As well as increasing its energy interests, the Eastern acquisition
has other benefits for Hanson, namely the non-cyclical earnings, good
cashflow, strong growth potential and a better balance between its UK
and US businesses.
Hanson's existing UK businesses include Imperial Tobacco, Hanson
Brick, ARC, Seven Seas and Crabtree. Hanson had gearing of 37% at the
end of the half year. The Eastern acquisition pushes the pro forma
gearing level to 130% but Mr Bonham said he was confident that a mixture
of cost cutting, operating cashflow and further disposals of non-core
businesses would reduce the gearing quite substantially.
The generous terms of the Hanson bid raised speculation that
ScottishPower might have to increase its hostile offer for Manweb to
secure a recommendation but the two RECs are vastly different. Hanson is
paying a premium price for what is widely perceived to be the best of
the privatised RECs, a low-cost, low-price producer. Eastern's operating
efficiency is recognised by the regulator who has awarded it the most
favourable price control regime.
The lower ScottishPower bid reflects the amount of work needed to
bring Manweb closer to the financial performance of Eastern.
ScottishPower continues to believe that its offer is ''full and fair''
and that there is no case for an MMC referral.
Hanson's bid is the third in the electricity sector in as many weeks
and follows what is widely seen to be a benign second distribution
review by the industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild. The
subsequent takeover frenzy highlights the perception that the RECs have
continuing scope to make good profits.
Customers seem to have been forgotten in all the melee. Whilst the
distribution review does deliver further price cuts to customers, maybe
it is time that a thorough review of the whole sector was carried out by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. (In the absence of an MMC review,
Hanson expects to have completed the Eastern acquisition within three
months.)
The case for such a review is all the more pressing given the
likelihood of the flotation of the National Grid in the autumn. Eastern
has the largest holding in the National Grid at 12.5%, a stake which is
estimated to be worth #500m. In the absence of an announcement of such a
review, we can expect to hear news of further bids in the weeks ahead
with East Midlands and London Electricity seen as the most vulnerable.
Predators, both at home and abroad, are likely to take the view that
there may never be such an advantageous time to bid for a UK electricity
distribution company.

SCOT Andrew Dougal, who became finance director of Hanson only two
months ago, played a key role in the company's blockbuster bid for
Eastern Group.
While the City continued to speculate that the Anglo-US conglomerate
was looking at Yorkshire Electricity, Dougal was one of only a handful
of people who knew what was really happening.
For the last few weeks, the former Greenock Academy and Paisley
Grammar pupil has been involved in top-level discussions with Eastern,
via Goldman Sachs.
Dougal, a Glasgow University graduate who began his career in 1972 in
the Glasgow office of accountancy firm Arthur Young, only became finance
director of Hanson on June 1.
Given that his rapid rise was in no small measure down to previous
work on Hanson's biggest-ever purchase , Consolidated Goldfields, and
the post-acquisition break-up of Imperial Group, Dougal's baptism of
fire is somehow fitting.
Speaking last night, at the end of a gruelling day of City meetings,
he said: ''Going in at the deep end is very often the best way, as long
as you can swim.''
Hanson prides itself in its ability to wrongfoot the City. Its
obsession with complete confidentiality results in a much greater burden
on a few top people.
Dougal, who was hand-picked as a financial controller of Hanson by
chief executive Derek Bonham back in 1986, said: ''In Hanson, we tend to
do a lot of the work in-house. We don't tend to surround ourselves with
huge numbers of external advisors.
''That means that considerable work falls upon the relatively small
number of executives we have here, which makes it fascinating.''
Dougal earned his spurs conducting lower-level financial analysis work
on Hanson's ''white knight'' bid for Consolidated Goldfields, which the
conglomerate acquired for #3200m back in 1989.
Dougal also helped integrate Imperial Group into Hanson. This involved
the disposals of the likes of Golden Wonder, HP Foods and Courage
Breweries.
Hanson's #2500m bid for Eastern, its first major play since the $2300m
(#1400m) purchase of Quantum Chemicals of the US two years ago, is the
second-largest the company has made.
Now that Hanson's long-awaited bid for an English regional electricity
company has been announced, one of the questions facing Dougal will be
the appropriate structure of a funding package.
Assuming the deal receives regulatory and shareholder approval, he
will then have to apply his financial expertise to the integration of
Eastern into the mighty Hanson.
The conglomerate's task has been eased by the fact that it has been
able to agree a bid with Eastern.
Although Hanson is best known for its hostile approach, and its
ability to pounce on underperformers and cut out cost, the two bids
which Dougal has been involved with have both been amicable.
He said the process of discussions with Eastern had been very helpful
and had given Hanson a much more substantial understanding of the
business than would have been yielded by its own analysis.
Dougal received the call back to Hanson's head office, as deputy
finance director, only 18 months ago.
He had left head office in 1989 to become finance director of ARC,
Consolidated Goldfields' largest subsidiary, and was later appointed
managing director of ARC's biggest subsidiary, ARC Southern.
His earlier-than-expected promotion to finance director of Hanson was
a result of the group's decision to demerge 34 non-core businesses in
the US and the resultant management changes, which saw predecessor Bill
Landuyt move to the States.
Turning the clock back about 15 years, Dougal gained valuable
experience of the acquisition game during his time with Scottish and
Universal Investments, the House of Fraser family's industrial holding
company which was acquired by Lonrho in 1980.
Shortly after the takeover, Dougal helped Tiny Rowland acquire The
Observer newspaper from US oil company Atlantic Richfield.

ABBEY National's takeover enthusiasm is cooling down and it will be
off the bid trail for the next two or three years while it consolidates
after the proposed cash acquisitions of National &amp; Provincial Building
Society for #1350m and the First National Finance Corporation consumer
credit group for #285m.
However, chairman Lord Tugendhat did not rule out smaller infill
purchases.
The bank remains cautious over prospects in the housing market and
says that in due course it will pick up, but at the same time expects no
resurgence over three to four years.
Understandably, it is anxious to boost the non-mortgage side of its
business to the extent that that will contribute about half profits by
the year 2000.
In the first six months, pre-tax profits rose 14% to #483m, although
operating profits were just 10% higher. There has been a continuing
significant improvement (27%) in the bad debt and repossessions
situation, with overall provisions dropping almost a third to #28m,
while losses on repossessed properties sold on have dropped appreciably.
However, there is some loss of market share in new lending because of
the availability of cheap offers from a multitude of other lenders and
this accounted for just 4.4% in the first half, compared with 9.5% six
months earlier.
There was a slight improvement in the net interest margin, while the
cost position remained under good control. When the N&amp;P acquisition is
completed in perhaps a year's time, there will be a reduction of about
120 branches in the collective total to about 880, and a #50m fall in
annualised expense, as well as N&amp;P's strong customer base to provide a
sales platform for Abbey National insurance products.
Life assurance increased profits by 11% to #52m -- with Scottish
Mutual #2m higher at #25m annual pension business doubled, moving
against the industry trend.
There has also been a good response to the Abbey National PEP, which
has sucked in #87m. General insurance will widen under the joint venture
with Commercial Union, including motor in due course.
Treasury continues to astound by the level of profitability with an
extra #10m at #109m, despite heavy investment in information technology.
The blot is the loss of future profit following upon the Barings
collapse -- there were no losses but perhaps #10m of annualised profit
has been put in abeyance while the business is re-established with
another bank.
The FNFC takeover will bring in a substantial amount of unsecured
lending potential with some 2000 retail outlets feeding in new customers
looking for finance for house improvements and the like, and in a
sectorn where margins are twice those on mortgage lending.
Full-year profits seem likely to improve from #932m to about #1035m to
leave the shares at 521[1/2]p trading at 10.2 times possible earnings.
The interim dividend has been raised 27% to 7.25p, with a 24p total in
view for a 5.75% yield.

SCOTLAND becomes the centre of the universe, alienwise, at the end of
the month when Channel 4 presents a weekend of extra-terrestrial
experiences live from Glasgow. The coverage coincides with Intersection,
the world's biggest science-fiction convention which is being held at
the SECC.
An interested viewer will be Bob Taylor, a forester who had an
extremely close encounter with aliens 16 years ago when he was pursued
by robots from a spacecraft which had landed in Dechmont Woods,
Livingston.
Now 77 and living in retirement in Perthshire, Bob fears being
pestered all over again in the wake of Channel 4 coverage. ''The truth
is I never saw any ET-like creatures,'' Bob said yesterday. ''I was too
busy escaping the clutches of the robots -- resembling sea mines --
whose spikes ripped my pants.''
The black serge trousers were taken into police custody to be used by
police in evidence. The breeks became something of a cause celebre when
they were handed over by the polis to a TV company making a film on the
subject.
They are now in the hands of Scottish UFO fans, who venerate them.
Indeed, the Fortean Times, official organ of those who believe in all
this stuff, recently referred to Bob Taylor's trousers as ''the Turin
Shroud of ufology''.
Despite herculean efforts (well, three phone calls) we cannot find out
who actually has the sacred serge trousers but we hope they will be on
display at the SF convention.
All for Rabbie
THE haggis has been slighted and by no less an organisation than the
Taste of Burns Country committee. A tartan box arrived on our desk. It
contained a bite-size haggis and the message: ''Is this the best we can
do?''
The haggis, now unfortunately consigned to the bin because of the
odour-inducing effect of this unusually hot weather, came courtesy of Mr
Laurie Black, patron of Fouter's Bistro in Ayr and chairman of Taste of
Burns Country.
What, we asked, has Mr Black got against the chieftain o' the puddin'
race? Nothing, he said, but if our chefs can make such a delicious dish
out of a sheep's lungs, heart,liver, and stomach, just think what they
should be able to achieve with the other bits.
The Taste of Burns Country programme is part of next year's
celebration of the bicentenary of the bard's birth. With support from
the Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise agencies, chefs from
60 restaurants will get the chance to undergo training at the hands of
such Scottish culinary masters as Nick Nairn of Braeval Mill and David
Wilson of the Peat Inn.
Getting a bit technical, Mr Black said: ''We want to stop a lot of the
over-cooking that goes on and the swamping of food with sauces. We want
to encourage more grilling and more poaching.'' We could have said, but
didn't, that there was no lack of poaching in Ayrshire.
The Diary, for one, is prepared to forego our usual Ayrshire diet of a
fish tea if it's going to help mark Rabbie's birthday.

DEPT of A Nation Once Again: The Grampian TV documentary Highlanders
sought to raise various issues about nationhood in the wake of Culloden
and the failed Jacobite rising. There was one, small answer at the very
end of the programme when viewers were invited to apply for a booklet
based on the programme. They had to write to an address in London.

DEPT of A Nation Once Again, Again: Heinz have a range of traditional

IT has always seemed to us that Edinburghers take little interest in
the international festival which takes place in their city. (''Och no, I
don't think I'll be going to anything. Perhaps the Tattoo, but that's
all.'')
Now we hear of some capital citizens who will actually be performing
during the festival. They are a bunch of stand-up comedians who can be
caught each Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday at the Comic Den at
Christie's pub in West Port.
Under the name Take the Stand, they proudly proclaim: ''We're here all
year.'' The people behind the venture are Salt'n'Sauce Promotions.
Salt and sauce, for those unfamiliar with Edinburgh cuisine, is what
is liberally splashed over the comestibles in capital chip shops. The
sauce bit is a mixture of vinegar and brown sauce. Sounds horrific,
tastes great.
Among the many turns at Taking the Stand is Bill Dewar who is
described as ''Scotland's leading exponent of packaging humour''. His
previous experience includes being an iceman with a frozen food
distributor before diversifying into selling crisps and savoury snacks.
He has been described as Bathgate's only existentialist forklift driver
but we find that hard to believe.
Rising to the occasion
THERE was a veritable shoal of entries to our True Blue Fish Photie
competition, including many puns even worse than the one contained in
this sentence. Suggested names for the wee scaly fellow included Fergus
the Fish, Billy the Fish, and Gordan Perch. Our favourite was Timothy
Malloy O'Pilchard.
One of the better puns came from Stan Mallinson of Glasgow who thought
the fish was saying: ''It'll never be 10 in a roe.'' Denis Carberry of
Pollok, Glasgow, suggested that he is in fact Timmy Troot (the daftest
fish in the burn) and he is saying: ''I've got 'Celtic for the Treble'
tattooed on my erse -- you can't swallow that, so just throw me back''.
But after due consideration the judges have awarded the bottle of
Rangers champagne to David Carson of Dumbarton, who says: ''The fish in
question is obviously Billy 'Hazza' Haddock, great nephew of former
Clyde and Scotland full back Harry, and he is saying; 'And Mr McCann
even promised that ah'd get bait mair often'.''

YESTERDAY's #2500m plus agreed bid by conglomerate Hanson for Eastern
Group, the largest of the regional electricty suppliers, is something
the City has been expecting for almost a year, though various companies
have been mooted as possible targets.
Whether, though, this will prove to be Lord Hanson's valedictory throw
before his retirement remains to be seen. But for the moment, anyway,
Lord Hanson's company has taken another quantum leap, always assuming
the bid gets past the regulatory bodies.
The growth of Hanson to its present eminence owes a lot to Lord
Hanson's fellow director Gordon White, who heads up the US business. It
was White who suggested the two build a conglomerate through
acquisition, using a public company as a vehicle.
The basic strategy has never changed. They search for staid companies
in basic industries with strong market shares so that technological
change or competition would not be too threatening.
Then an established ''Hansonisation'' process is instituted, where
financial controls are tightened, costs cut and unwanted parts of the
company acquired sold off to provide the seed corn for the next
purchase.
Some major coups by Hanson Plc made the City institutions sit up and
take note. In 1980 the group took over Ever Ready after an epic battle,
and promptly recouped 40% of the purchase price by selling the
lossmaking European operations.
Another similar, though even more dramatic, purchase was United
Drapery Stores, where #190m of the #265m was recouped through selling
assets.
White had also finally hit the big time in the US, notably with the
audacious purchase of SCM for $1000m. At home, Hanson was looking at
ever larger targets, and the #2700m takeover of Imperial Group, the
tobacco company, took some digesting.
The Thatcher decade was Hanson Plc's heyday, when everything seemed to
go right and the shares had an enthusiastic following. An extraordinary
decade was capped by the acquisition of Consolidated Gold Fields for
#3300m.
But by this time the problem for a group depending on acquisitions for
profits growth was glaringly obvious -- it would eventually run out of
bid targets big enough.
Hanson failed to see the climate was turning against the mega-deal as
the 1990s got underway, and the group made a serious mistake when he
trained his sights on the stock market bellwether, ICI.
Hanson Plc never actually bid for the chemicals giant. It just
suggested co-operation after it bought a 2.8% stake. There is every
indication that Lord Hanson was taken aback by the furious reaction of
ICI and the doubts expressed in the press.
ICI managed to focus growing investor disenchantment with ''financial
engineering'' -- the complex accounting procedures and tax avoidance
strategies on which acquisitive companies so often depend to achieve
growth in earnings per share.
Its hard-hitting defence also uncovered a previously unknown
investment by the Hanson group -- #10m worth of racehorses which ran in
the colours of Lord White. This was a grave embarrassment.
Lord Hanson retired hurt with his reputation damaged.
But this did not stop Hanson Plc from pulling off a vintage deal soon
after with the purchase of Beazer, a UK housebuilder with interests in
US aggregates.
Lord Hanson has run the company for 30 years very much as a personal
empire and his personal charm ensures great loyalty from his staff. It
simply cannot be the same company when he finally goes, though this is
not planned before 1997.

MR Whittle writing about the costs of rail travel seems to be
ill-informed (July 15). While the national rail passenger figures are a
7% share, Strathclyde has a much larger share than this due to the
excellent rail network that has been invested in over the years.
Countering his point on BR's profits, I would suggest the only reason
that BR is profitable is the increase in subsidy to make the network
more attractive to potential investors.
The income-tax question is nullified when you level the playing field
by making road-users pay the whole cost of road usage. That includes new
infrastructure, maintenance, and the #16 billion on accidents.
Using Mr Whittle's figures and those provided in the Royal Commission
for the Environment's report, 8p is added to income tax by road travel,
compared with the 1p stated for rail by Mr Whittle.
Just making rail-users pay for the full costs would see another huge
increase in road-users. Adding the full costs to road-users would see a
massive increase in public transport usage.
Electrification of the Edinburgh-Glasgow line is not really a
cost-effective proposal. The time benefits which electrification would
bring would be negligible over the present diesel units.
On the other hand, the West Coast main line has been neglected for 25
years and the proposed investment is vital to enable us at least to keep
what we've got. The West Coast main line is the main route for freight
and passengers from Scotland. No investment would prove to be a costly
mistake.
In think that privatisation will be disastrous, but I also feel that
the present management team are the best and most innovative we've had
for years. I wish them all the best.

MR Gordon Lind has raised certain questions concerning Mr Tom Clarke,
MP (July 26).
Integrity in government, whether local or national, is vital to public
confidence. Thus where bad practice or worse is found or suspected it
must be investigated.
Labour is doing just that in Monklands. Ian Lang, when Secretary of
State, could have done so. He chose not to do so.
The conduct of Mr David Shaw, MP, was at the very least mendacious. In
January, 1993, the Government was in difficulty over arms for Iraq and
the Pergau Dam affair. I cannot remember whether questions at #1000 a
time came later or earlier. I doubt whether Monklands' difficulties
would have had his attention if the seat of the late John Smith had not
been in the area.
Mr Shaw was engaged in diversionary mud-slinging. Such behaviour
devalues our political system.
Later that year we had a by-election which sunk so low that The
Herald's critical editorial gained nationwide prominence.
I have met Tom Clarke a few times this year in his capacity as Shadow
Minister for disabled people. I find he is doing an excellent job. Yet
when he raised serious questions on Government policy on the very day
Labour suspended its councillors, the Prime Minister failed to answer
them, preferring to play with Monklands like Mr Lind.
Six and a half million disabled people deserve better.

IN his letter entitled Finding out the facts about Monklands, Richard
Ashdown refers to ''insidious . . . attempts of the local and national
press to play the religious discrimination card'' (July 29).
On behalf of the local press, namely the Airdrie and Coatbridge
Advertiser, may I correct this blatant inaccuracy?
Since the Advertiser broke the Monklandsgate story three years ago we
have consistently argued that the sectarian angle is a red herring,
serving merely to distract attention from the real issues.
These we identified as nepotism and patronage in the granting of
council jobs, a geographical spending imbalance, and an arrogant disdain
on the part of the ruling clique for the genuine concerns of many local
residents.
Far from playing the religious discrimination card, insidiously or
otherwise, we have gone to great lengths to play down what we have
always seen as a dangerous side-issue.
Mr Ashdown also says, in reference to his company's report on the
council's personnel procedures, that criticisms contained therein were
''based on experience and informed judgment, unlike the allegations that
went before and which have continued unabated since''.
May I remind him that the original ''allegations'' were made by four
members of the ruling Labour group who were so disillusioned by what was
going on that they felt unable to remain silent any longer?
More than enough ''experience and informed judgment'' there, I would
have thought.

I AM amazed at Mr Ashdown's statement that ''Monklands District
Council has a lot to be proud of in what it has done for people in the
whole of the area'' (July 29).
Mr Ashdown is rightly concerned about the facts coming to light, so
can I ask what Monklands District Council has done for the people of
Airdrie? This is at the nub of this whole issue.
As a proud citizen of Airdrie, I feel nothing but contempt for this
council as I have watched my town centre degenerate to an area of open
spaces, empty shops, and cheap discount stores at the expense of
Coatbridge, as the financial figures have proved.
The people of Airdrie gave their verdict on these issues at the
by-election last year. If Mr Ashdown could give us Airdrieonians the
facts of why we should be proud of the district council and even one
achievement within our town we would be delighted to hear of them.

YOUR correspondent who took some time to find her way to New Lanark
should realise that she is venturing deep into an unknown and mysterious
hinterland (July 28).
She is abandoning the refinements of urban life, and the prospect is
of exciting and leafy adventure, a prospect heightened by the vagaries
of privatised public transport.
Even the natives, friendly enough these days, don't always speak the
dialect of the Glaswegian tourist.
The answer to her problem was a hazardous 50-yard pavement trek, from
the haven of Lanark railway station to the headquarters of the Clyde
Valley Tourist Board.
Not only would she have received sympathy and understanding for the
excesses of the journey, but she would have been advised how to reach
the hidden valley which cradles the jewel that is New Lanark.
It is true that the village bus will stop on a single yellow line if
you give the appropriate explorers' arresting signal. The bus is not
always full of chickens and similar local colour, but it does run about
once every hour and a half.
Failing this, a taxi costs #2 in local currency. The walk is about 20
minutes downhill following the road signs, or the stream of other
back-packers heading youth-hostelwards.
Ultimately it is always possible to phone the New Lanark rescue
service on 01555 661345. We will do our best to advise the intrepid
traveller how to avoid entrapment on the journey, and also on the best
current policy for dealing with our decaying public transport
infrastructure.
It is all good preparation for visiting one of the great historic
sites of Scotland. The reward of arrival makes the hopeful journey even
more worthwhile.

IT is not too difficult to empathise with Jimmy Reid's cri de coeur
against the renewed determination of Tony Blair's New Labour Party to
distance itself from the trade unions by further reducing their
percentage share of the vote at party conferences (July 27).
Nevertheless Jimmy Reid grossly overstates his case when he claims
that Old Labour was ''the most democratic party in Britain, arguably in
the world''.
In point of strict fact Old Labour always was -- and, one suspects,
New Labour remains -- notoriously undemocratic in its internal modus
operandi. The construction of artificial majorities through the rigorous
mandating not just of trade-union but of constituency delegates, the
ruthless compositing of resolutions so as to minimise the prospects of
the platform being politically embarrassed by conference votes, and the
invention of constitutional rules of labyrinthine complexity --
regarding for example, the selection of parliamentary candidates -- have
long been traditional features of Labour's internal organisation which
raise questions about the party's commitment to genuine democracy.
After all, Jimmy Reid himself was forced to concede that the
monolithic block vote -- which John Smith and Tony Blair have quite
correctly sought to abandon -- ''was an anachronism,'' though it is not
clear that he fully appreciates just how much of an anachronism it was.
It was an anachronism not simply because it failed to reflect
differences in the views of union members who were nevertheless quite
happy to continue to pay a political levy to the Labour Party; it was
even more of an anachronism in so far as it failed to reflect the views
of the majority of trade-union members who actually failed to vote
Labour at the last four General Elections.
While it is entirely understandable that Labour should now be
attempting to distance itself from organisations which can no long be
relied upon to deliver the Labour vote, isn't it about time that the
trade unions theselves took more account of the views of those among
their own rank-and-file membership who have already deserted Labour,
assuming that they ever supported the party in the first place?

<TEXT>
THE Church of England's General Synod has voted to ratify the Porvoo
(in Finland) agreement for inter-communion between certain Lutheran and
Anglican churches including, it appears, the Scottish Episcopal Church.
This means that churches which have the historic episcopate would now
have to ''affirm the apostolic continuity of those Churches in which the
sign episcopal succession has at some time not been used,'' eg in the
Church of Scotland.
In turn this means that the Scottish Episcopal Church's recent
suggestion of ''seven-year bishops'' which the Church of Scotland might
take into its system can have no theological force whatever -- and why
should one change for non-theological reasons?
I do not think the Church of Scotland regards its episcopalian sister
as less than Christian, and no member of the Scottish Episcopal Church
need suppose -- in the light of Porvoo -- that he or she will receive
less than a full communion if taking part in a Church of Scotland
communion.
I understand, however, from the Ecumenical News International that one
Anglican priest wishes to take the Church of England to court to stop
the Porvoo agreement taking effect for his church.
It will be interesting to see whether a similar move comes from a
Scottish Episcopalian. And what will be the non-Porvoo Roman Catholic
Church's stance?
Incidentally, some Lutheran churches in Europe see themselves as
closer to the Reformed than to the Anglican churches.
I remain convinced that mutual recognition of ministries and of the
existing church structures is the Christian solution.
We are ''justified by faith and not by works'' -- though ''works''
have their place -- and none of us can claim that our interpretations of
Scripture regarding the ministry or communion are final.

THERE is an old adage about heat and kitchens that Charles Kennedy
should ponder as he reflects on the Lib Dems' narrow win in
Littleborough and Saddleworth (July 29).
So the Labour Party turns its guns on the Lib Dems. So what? That is
what political parties are all about, fighting their opponents and
maximising their votes.
As to the ''unfairness'' of Labour's attacks, from a party that has
blatantly played the race card over the years, from Birmingham Ladywood
to Tower Hamlets, this is really a bit rich.
And as for their recent commitment to animal welfare, where were the
Lib Dems when Labour tried to introduce clauses into the Criminal
Justice Public Order Bill to protect badgers from baiting and property
owners from hunters?
The facade of integrity of the Lib Dems slips double quick when
expediency demands it. I need only cite how David Steel's enthusiasm for
devolution, at the time of the referendum, quickly evaporated when he
discovered that a majority of his constituents opposed it.

The age-old skills of Scotch whisky making are being complemented, as
Sue Tranter reports, by the fast-lane moves of modern marketing and
sponsorship techniques
AT Scotland's most northerly whisky distillery things are much as you
would hope to find them. The barley is malting on a stone floor in the
traditional way, the peat fire is smoking nicely and barrels of the
finest malt are stacked in an old stone warehouse awaiting eventual
export in around 12 years time. Nothing hurries here.
Even the distillery cat is slumbering in the office Out Tray after a
night shift of rodent control.
Highland Park, with its familiar pagoda-shaped drying vents, is now
the only distillery operating on Orkney.
Little seems to have changed around the place since it was established
in 1798. So it comes as a surprise to find that the brand manager for
this favourite malt is not a crusty Orcadian of venerable years but a
youthful father of three young children who flies in regularly to nearby
Kirkwall from Perthshire.
The nearest British motorway to Orkney is 250 miles away in Perth,
which is co-incidentally the home town of Matthew Gloag and Son, the
parent company of Highland Park, and a group of other labels including
Scotland's leading blended whisky, The Famous Grouse.
Next month Steven Sleigh switches from his job on the malts to become
brand group manager for The Famous Grouse. After three years with the
company, he is one of a team of young marketing executives whose youth
is in stark contrast to the traditional, historic image of the product
they enthusiastically, even passionately, market worldwide.
Steven chose a career in the wine trade after gaining a business
degree at Strathclyde.
He started out with a London wine merchant and specialised in fine
wines for a couple of years. He then took a diploma in wines and spirits
and landed himself a scholarship to Portugal.
''I wanted to move into the branded end of the market,'' he says, ''so
I moved to a merchant with a broader range, including cognacs, champagne
and whiskies. But when the opportunity arose to join Matthew Gloag it
was too good to miss because of the brand's quality and reputation.''
He has now been working in Perth for three years and last year took
the Macallan and Glengoyne labels into his portfolio. The marketing
department at Gloag's has expanded rapidly, in fact as marketing
controller Maurice Breen explains, it didn't formally exist seven years
ago. Now, like most whisky companies, marketing has become crucial in a
highly-competitive world, and in an industry where fortunes fluctuate.
Maurice Breen is still in his early thirties, and has been with the
company for five years. He agrees that executives at Matthew Gloag and
Son don't mirror the stereotypes, which he says is an advantage.
''It's important to communicate our message to younger drinkers and to
develop an enthusiasm for Scotch, with its unique quality and heritage.
''But we won't change our core message of quality, which is as
relevant to younger people as to our more traditional consumers, perhaps
more so in a society where quality names and labels matter.''
Recruiting into the industry is done with an eye to world sales.
''We look for people who have an empathy with the product, but who can
also implement a brand message internationally. It's not about simply
controlling an advertising and promotional budget, but the effective
development and implementation of a complete business strategy.''
Recently, an important part of that strategy for the The Famous Grouse
was the sponsorship of the Rugby World Cup in South Africa, a massive
commitment on the part of the Perthshire company, and one which
continues with the ongoing sponsorship of the Scottish rugby squad.
At the sharp end of that partnership, Sarah Gilchrist is typical of
the modern, young executives now marketing whisky. She is currently the
senior brand manager for The Famous Grouse and vintage imbibers who
stubbornly cling to the manly image of Scotland's national drink will
surely be shocked to learn that the twinning of whisky and rugby are
among her responsibilities.
They may be even more surprised to learn that next month she becomes
senior brand manager for the group's malts, including Highland Park from
Orkney and Bunnahabhain from Islay.
''I had always wanted to work with whisky because it is uniquely
Scottish. It is extremely rewarding as a product, and everything is
aimed at the premium end of the market. Everything involved in the
business is done in great detail with immense thoroughness, and of
course The Famous Grouse is a fantastic brand.''

UNTIL recently I had been a member of the committee of a junior
football club in Ayrshire. The bulk of the clubs in the junior game
today exist as a result of patronage. Some would refer to it as
sponsorship but I think the former is nearer the mark.
I have travelled to every ground in Ayrshire, to many in the Central
League, and also further afield, and what has struck me is the
dilapidated condition of the facilities in which budding professional
footballers have to learn their trade.
I am also of the opinion that for many supporters, and the junior game
has some of the best, it is their only focus of transcendency.
Lottery cash for projects such as the upgrading of facilities at
junior stadia is the remit of the Football Trust in conjunction with the
Scottish Sports Council. Can I now ask how many junior clubs have
applied to the Football Trust for a grant, received the form, read it,
and thrown it away? I would not like to put money on a correct answer!
The form which the Sports Council sends out insists on so many
conditions and puts many impediments in the way of the applicant that it
is better not to bother.
The club I was involved with -- we are not owners of the stadium, it
is rented from the local authority -- decided that the shop facility was
far from the standard required to sell the staples of every football
match, pies, Bovril, tea, and coffee.
We decided to apply to the Football Trust, after we had purchased a
large lockable container, for a grant to allow us to plumb in a water
supply and to connect mains electricity.
It reached the point where we had to enlist the help of our local MP,
who is the honorary president of the club, to expedite the application.
What the club received was a drop in the bucket compared to the total
cost of the refurbishment and we had to rely on the generosity of a
local building contractor to complete the first phase of the work.
The club were informed that applications over a certain amount would
be processed between 12 and 18 months. Sums under that amount, a paltry
figure incidentally, could be granted in a matter of weeks, but only
with the help of someone in authority.
The money was received and part of the work was done, but two years on
the work still has to be completed. The bulk of the revenue, for a club
in our position, is sponsorship for which we are extremely grateful.
That money, in 99% of cases, goes directly to the manager to put a
team on the park, so where does the money come from to upgrade the
facilities that we would very much like to offer?
The junior football scene in Scotland will most certainly leave a
bitter taste in the mouths of most committee men who love their clubs.
It behoves the people with their hands in the till to free much more of
this money on a fairer, more even, distribution basis.
Junior football deserves it more than most!

MY understanding is that the rules on Lottery grants include that the
grant must represent no more than 50% of the total project cost, and
monies must be spent only on capital items.
In the case of the grant to the Royal Opera the largest part of the
#55m will be spent to meet temporary accommodation costs which can
hardly be described as a capital cost. The total project cost is
presumably a staggering #110m. Who is paying the #55m?
Perhaps those who approved this grant might tell lesser punters (who
contributed) as to which particular factor best qualified this
application to ignore these rules.

THE English tabloids would be foolish and ill-advised to treat the
decision by the High Court in the case of Michelle and Lisa Taylor as a
victory. Certainly, Lord Justice Stuart Smith and Mr Justice Butterfield
have decided that the decision of the Attorney-General not to prosecute
the Sun, Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, and Daily Express for contempt of
court is not open to challenge. But one of the judges stated that the
offending newspapers, whose reporting of the sisters' trial led to their
murder convictions being quashed, had crossed the acceptable limits of
fair and accurate reporting by a substantial margin. The issue is really
a stark and simple one, although the law surrounding it has been allowed
to get into an unholy mess in England, largely through the lethargy and
timidity of Attorney-Generals over many years.
People accused of crime should be allowed to have a fair trial based
on the evidence that is led in court before jurors who have as little
previous knowledge about the case as is acceptable in a democratic
society. If nothing else, the televising of the OJ Simpson case has
shown the intractable problem of securing justice if every aspect of the
case is examined in minute detail even before a suspect is arrested.
That is a dangerous path which the legal system and the media in
Scotland have resolutely declined to go down. In England, although
exactly the same Contempt of Court Act applies as in Scotland, the
warning signs have been flashing long before the Taylor case, but have
been studiously ignored by successive Attorney-Generals.  Who can forget
the reporting of the triumphal police conference at the capture of Peter
Sutcliffe, who turned out to be the Yorkshire Ripper, although at that
time had been charged only with a motoring offence. More recently, of
course, the coverage of the Fred and Rosemary West case has been nothing
short of a disgrace. It is the string-em-up, save the expense of a
trial, lynch-mob mentality of the Wild West. The problem with
approaching justice in this fashion is not just that you increase the
risk of convicting the innocent. You also multiply the chances of
allowing the guilty to escape because, even if there is a sufficiency of
evidence, you cannot be sure that the jury reached its verdict on what
was said in court or the prejudicial publicity. The more sensational the
case, the greater the need for the media to approach it in a cool and
level-headed fashion.
Rightly or wrongly, the impression has been created in England that
the Attorney-General has been afraid to take on powerful media giants
with unlimited financial resources. It is also difficult to escape the
conclusion that some sections of the media know perfectly well that they
are creating a serious risk of prejudicing a trial but are prepared to
publish incriminating background details and pictures because if they
don't their rivals will. On the unlikely assumption that they are
prosecuted, a #50,000 fine is a price worth paying in the circulation
war. Views have been expressed that by following the rules, the media in
Scotland has somehow been failing in its job to inform the public. We
would say rather that the Scottish press has exercised a degree of
responsibility that is in the broad interests of justice. There is, of
course, a delicate balance to be maintained between the right to publish
and the right to a fair trial and the media must always be vigilant to
ensure that the law does not become too restrictive, as it undoubtedly
did in Scotland in the 1960s. There has been a recognition north of the
Border that the right to a fair trial is rather more important and
fundamental than tomorrow's headlines. It is time that truth was
recognised in England, too.

MY JOB Building society manager
Society is brought to book as Eric Kennedy reveals
ISABEL Anderson has mortgaged her future, but nothing could give her
more pleasure. Her life as a building society office manager gives her,
shall we say, plenty of interest and she is never bored.
''You couldn't be bored in this job,'' she says. ''Building societies
have changed. There's a lot of variety.''
She is referring to issuing foreign currency for travel, advising on
investments, helping with queries on automated cash dispensers, and
other activities which seem light years away from the building society
of old.
Not that there is anything dull about the core business of arranging
mortgages and insurance, she hastens to add, especially as she herself
got married only recently, and has first-hand experience of all that.
It might be worth mentioning that building-society employees have a
bit of a laugh over the rest of us when it comes to home loans. They get
a preferential rate, and every little discount helps when such large
sums of money are involved.
Not that such considerations were high on the priority list of the
girl who studied at Drumcanrig Secondary in East Kilbride, then spent
two years at Kirkcaldy High School, as her father was in a contract
engineering job which involves quite a lot of moving around.
She left the school in 1985 with Highers in English, French, and
Secretarial Studies. Isabel then began a two-year Business Studies and
Languages course at Bell College in Hamilton. Her family had by then
moved back to East Kilbride. However, she had to abandon the course
after a year when her father moved the family to Italy for seven months.
When she came back to Scotland she worked as an accounts assistant for
a year, then joined the Abbey National as a cashier, moving on to become
a mortgage adviser. There she underwent a training course in
interviewing and insurance, and she moved to the Alliance and Leicester
in Hamilton in December, 1989.
She was a senior customer adviser there, supervising four people in
the mortgage department.
Towards the end of February this year the office manager's job at the
society's Clarkston branch was advertised internally. Isabel applied,
and started work in February. She reports to the branch manager, who is
also responsible for two other branches, and there are six staff, some
part-time.
She is in charge of the branch most of the time, responsible for
security, efficiency, promoting the work of the branch and the society,
and organising or carrying out the weekly staff training sessions.
She has to deal with the public every day, which she enjoys. Isabel
finds a monthly meeting for office managers, usually held in a
city-centre hotel, a great help in exchanging ideas.
Her own training days are not over and, apart from taking part in
courses organised by the society, she is considering embarking on exams
which could make her an associate of the Chartered Building Society
Institute.
''All in all, it is an interesting and worthwhile job,'' she says.
''There are clear opportunities for advancement, and I would recommend
it to anyone.''

RIPPLES from the film-making fiasco at Ballycotton will spread across
the Irish Sea. In particular, the sad fate of Divine Rapture may give
supporters of Scotland's promising film industry -- a small but
resilient force -- pause for thought. Ever since the Irish government
introduced measures to attract film makers to the republic, envious
looks have been cast in that direction by the movie makers of this
country. Britain's apparent official indifference to the state of its
film industry has been compared unfavourably to Irish enthusiasm. And
Irish faith has paid off, as proved by the tally of 18 films made there
in the past year. In one case Scotland could justifiably claim that ''we
was robbed'', for it was a cruel irony that Braveheart, the epic story
of our national hero in the person of Mel Gibson, came to be located in
Ireland rather than on William Wallace's native heath.
Now the sad saga of Divine Rapture, by all accounts a gentle tale of
Irish whimsy with a helping of magico-religious blarney, shows that film
making is not always a money spinning certainty for all concerned. There
have been losses all round. Even the talents (or at least the box-office
appeal) of Marlon Brando in the unlikely role of village priest were
unable to attract sufficient funds to save the movie. After a mere
fortnight on location the stars have departed, local extras have been
laid off, bills are unpaid, hotels and bed-and-breakfasts have lost
their expected custom, and Ballycotton's dreams of entering the hall of
filmic fame (with corresponding tourist interest in the future) have
been shattered. And so Ballycotton retreats once again into the
backwaters. A salutory tale -- for in other circumstances it could be
Plockton, or Moniaive, or Pinwherry.
Movies will always be a risk business and from our viewpoint across
the water the collapse of Divine Rapture seems more like a farce than a
tragedy. There is talk in Ireland of introducing a bond system as a
safeguard in the future. Meanwhile Britain still manages to stay in the
picture. Rob Roy was set among the lochs and not the loughs. On a more
modest scale there has been a resurgence in films which are truly
Scottish, which depend wholly on Scottish creativity, draw inspiration
from Scotland, and use home-grown talent. The thriller Shallow Grave has
been widely acclaimed and similar success is being predicted for the
forthcoming ''film noir with a Glasgow accent'', The Near Room, which
will be introduced next month at the Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival.
If such optimism can be generated on limited funding, what might be
achieved if there were wholehearted backing for a British film industry?

WEE Drew came back from holiday complaining he got sun-burned at Old
Trafford. He was sitting in the Rest Cupboard, the economy facility laid
on here which allows two to light up and the third to get a hit from
passive smoking, and he was brushing someone else's ash from a slightly
pink forearm.
Exposed to a rare win by England at cricket, the bitter reward for a
jaunt with pals to cheer on the Windies, he was inconsolable. Beyond
calomine lotion.
Wee Drew's squad had set out for Manchester on Saturday only mildly
perplexed by England's failure to collapse, but once they got their
seats out in the bleachers things just got worse.
They were confronted by the weary prospect of the home side insisting
on holding on to their sticky bats all day, making the other lot run
about and sweat. Laborious runs were being scored at periodic intervals.
The Windies sulked and hurled with inaccurate petulance, missing stumps,
batsmen's heads, and even the sight-screen at the other end when the
ball trundled down for byes and wides.
It was not cricket, not the cricket Wee Drew and his mates had come to
gloat over. Even the streakers were all at the wrong end of the ground,
eight of them in succession and only one woman, requiring seven
handkerchiefs and a blanket to make them all decent for their escort
from the listless oval. By now the crowd around Drew's party were well
away.
It was the final session, and they had been building a steady innings
with the beer since the opening.
They were from Preston, it turned out, and they started getting
obnoxious. They were noisy. They were drunk. They didn't like Windies
and after a few Mexican Waves they didn't like gringos.
What was getting up their nose about Wee Drew and the boys, in their
panama hats, with their binoculars and cool box, was that they were
still watching the cricket.
Call them old fashioned, call them naive or misguided, but they were
just there to see the game. Apparently, that's anathema.
Our lads, guests of Old Trafford on their Saturday outing, were
accused of being middle class.
Fortunately, it never got much beyond that, but it leads you to
thinking. Middle class? There are plenty of folk who would agree that
watching cricket is just about as mind-numbingly boring a way to spend a
day as they could conceive, but they don't usually pay their way into a
Test match to express their view. Still, I wonder if there might not be
a point at issue here.
You must have noted with some curiosity that Radio Clyde intend to
present their Saturday afternoon football Super Scoreboard programme
without having their team at any of the games.
Not so much an innovative idea as a necessity, perhaps, because the
station lost its contract for coverage with the Scottish Football
League. Newcomers Scot FM have struck a two-year exclusive deal which
will allow them live commentaries and reports around the grounds for
their Dug Out: Live programme.
The Clyde team intend just to sit around and talk all afternoon. Talk
about football every Saturday, but not necessarily be there. Virtual
football discussions. It's a radical concept. ''The ball is on the
slates as far as live commentary is concerned,'' wrote Clyde's programme
director Alex Dickson in this newspaper last week.
There are still a few slate roofs visible from Stark's Park,
Kirkcaldy. Perhaps the Clyde team intend to set up studio there for
Archie's reveries with Derek or Davie. Or hand over to Captain George in
the Eye In The Sky helicopter for an interview with the ball before it
descends towards the slates, just to keep ahead of the game.
Ceefax is my suggestion, and this goes for cricket as much as
football.
The game is much more exciting on Ceefax. It has real tension. You
wait and wait. They might be just retrieving the ball for a throw-in at
the football match, or toddling off for their tea at the cricket, but
you are willing a score with undiminished fervour, oblvious to the
hiatus.
You watch intently, interpreting all the little blips and flickers on
the Ceefax screen, wondering if this is to be a prelude to that
climactic moment when they flash up a goal, or a fallen wicket. And when
it comes, it is so sudden, so explosive. No slow build-ups. No
near-things. Just, bang! Your team has scored, and there in green
lettering is your scorer. What else do you need? What else could you
ever ask for?
So, maybe Alex is right. Maybe the neds from Preston have a point. Do
we really need to be watching this stuff any more, enduring the
disappointments and banalities of the real thing. Not being there
invites a supreme exercise of the imagination, and very soon we won't
even need the scores to sustain us.
Scottish football, and English Test cricket up until this weekend, are
too depressingly predictable to warrant our attention any more. It is
time to liberate the spectator from sport.

Geraldine Abrahams meets two men whose business philosophy aims to
make workers think positively and increase efficiency to new levels
IF you believe in two basic business principles -- that people are the
most valuable resource a company can have and that when people are happy
at work, they produce more and better work -- then it would seem to make
sense that anything which maximises the potential of the workforce must
be positive and creative, and of immense benefit to a company.
That is the ideal, but the reality is somewhat different, with
increasing numbers of people suffering from work-related stress. Keith
Bennett knows all about that. Until two years ago, he was the managing
director of a well-established quality consultancy: Conquest
Consultants, riding high on the crest of a wave when the company made a
disastrous move into the US marketplace.
The venture cost Conquest dearly. The company was liquidated and
although Keith continued to work in quality management, it was in a much
more contracted form, and from a more isolated position.
With the addition of financial worries, he was constantly exhausted,
drinking and smoking excessively, eating irregularly and unable to
sleep. A few months later, when his family collectively voiced their
concern, he realised that he had a problem and would have to deal with
it.
He decided to enrol on an individual-based training programme which he
had seen advertised in The Herald years before. The course was on TM or
Transcendental Meditation, which for most people conjures up pictures of
either Sixties hippies sitting around the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in
multi-coloured kaftans trying desperately to find inner peace, or of
saffron-robed monks with shaven heads. His visit to the TM centre in
Edinburgh exploded the myth.
He was taught how to meditate within ten minutes. ''The results for me
were astonishing,'' he says. ''Immediately I felt many of the stresses
and strains that I had accumulated over 18 months, dissolve. Within the
space of ten minutes I felt quite different -- less pain in my head, my
thinking was much clearer, neck muscles had relaxed and the constant
nausea I had been experiencing just vanished. I was taken aback by all
that. I remember walking back to the car feeling inexplicably happy in a
natural kind of way.''
The first big test for Keith was trying to meditate at home on his
own. He managed that, and then attended the other three days of the
course. He was told that the changes would be so subtle that he may not
even notice them, but they were instantly obvious to his family. After
only two meditations, he had hardly touched the glass of wine his wife
poured for him and had not smoked all evening.
That was last November. Since then he has found his approach to
business is now totally different. Practising TM for 20 minutes twice a
day, he sees everything in a more positive light.
He spends more time with his son, and family life in general is much
better. He looks forward to going to work in the morning and gets
through twice as much work as before, making fewer mistakes.
A by-product has been his growing interest in the mechanics of TM and
he has spent a lot of time examining the research on it, the most recent
of which has been business-based, focusing on companies and the
applications of TM at senior and middle management levels.
Looking at more than 100 Japanese companies where TM was introduced at
induction, there is evidence of higher productivity, lower absenteeism,
and a dramatic improvement in team-working. There were similar findings
from research carried out in the US.
Recognising that no one had targeted the business sector in this
country, Keith contacted the two Scottish TM centres and asked if he
could promote TM to businesses here.
Through quality management, he has retained links with Scottish
industry generally, and with the Local Enterprise Company network and
Scottish Enterprise at national level.
The TM centres agreed, but that was only half the battle. He still had
to persuade hard-nosed businessmen/women that this was an authentic way
of dealing with stress in the workplace -- a ''simple technique but a
difficult message'', according to Keith.
However, with 80% of physical disorders being stress-related, few
employers could ignore the fact that stress levels in business are
untenable -- especially when current legislation reminds employers of
their ''duty of care'' to their employees.
''When you are stressed you perceive negative, when you are relaxed
you perceive positive, see things as a challenge rather than a
problem,'' says Keith. ''When I took it up, I was told that my working
life would become easier, and that is true.
''With clearer thought, I am able to achieve much more, so much
faster, in an effortless way. This has become an extension of quality
management in which I am still involved.''
Keith Bennett considers himself living proof that the practice of TM
is one very positive way to alleviate the built-up stress, create a
satisfied workforce and to become more innovative in terms of marketing
techniques, manufacturing techniques and in service and delivery
techniques.
He has already started targeting those people he feels could benefit
from TM. He is conducting a series of seminars at One Devonshire Gardens
from September and every month thereafter, and invites senior business
people to attend a half-day seminar -- free of charge -- to explain to
them the process of the technique and the benefits that accrue.
He will be talking to former and present clients, and is about to make
a formal presentation to a major computer manufacturer based in
Scotland, and has found a useful analogy which describes the whole
process of TM.
''If you have some computer hardware that you want to run some more
advanced software on and you cannot afford to buy new piece of hardware,
you upgrade your existing hardware, and when you do that you will be
able to run more complex software,'' he says. ''With TM you are
upgrading the human physiology in a simple, natural way. There is no
mind-bending, no mind-altering. You positively look forward to doing it
every day.''

ALISON KERR predicts hilarious treats this month from jazz favourite
Marty Grosz.
IF past experience is anything to go by, then serious outbreaks of
hilarity can be expected up and down the country during the next couple
of weeks because both the Edinburgh and Nairn International Jazz
Festivals boast residencies by the inimitable Marty Grosz -- that
garrulous guru of the guitar.
Grosz is not your stereotypical jazzman. Tall, often bespectacled,
dapper (never onstage without a bow tie), even teetotal, ''Professor''
-- his nickname from army days -- would seem a more likely job title. As
Grosz himself points out: ''I'm probably the only jazz musician in the
world who reads The Letters of Lord Chesterfield to his Son, and the
works of Barbara Pym.''
Born in Berlin in 1930, Grosz came from an artistic background. In
1932 his father, the celebrated German expressionist, George Grosz
brought his family to America where Grosz grew up in a household
invariably sheltering political refugees, mostly artists and
intellectuals.
When Grosz talks about his father's early years on the New York social
circuit, he does so with the understandable envy of someone who was too
young to appreciate what was going on around him as it was going on.
This was the ''Jazz Age'' after all, and the Big Apple was the place to
be.
''My father was once at a party where George Gershwin had passed out
on a chair. Three or four guys just picked up the chair, carried him to
the next room, then rolled back the carpet and started to dance. I've
read subsequently that they would hire Fats Waller, James P Johnson, and
Willie the Lion Smith -- the great Harlem stride pianists -- to play at
these parties.''
Grosz's interest in jazz began when he was nine. ''I went to the
British building at the New York World's Fair and they had a short movie
showing. It had a little swingy combo playing, and as they played you
didn't see the band, you saw animation to it -- wavy lines, etc. I liked
that, and after going back several times the music stuck with me.''
Intrigued by this music, the young Grosz spent time in the library
reading up on jazz. He listened to everything and when he was at
boarding-school he would sneak out to catch bands playing in Boston. On
his way back from hearing Charlie Spivak's Orchestra, Grosz -- then on
probation for earlier AWOLs -- was spotted, reported and expelled. Once
back with his folks, he attended high school in Long Island. This added
a ''whole new dimension'' to his life.
Not only did this school have girls, but being at home meant that he
could practise playing his ''junky'' old guitar in the privacy of the
garage.
The secret practising continued until one evening when a friend of the
family came to dinner, armed with a concertina. He persuaded a reluctant
Grosz to duet with him for the other guests. ''We played Old Man River
and Blue Skies and my old man's cigar just about fell out his mouth!''
Luckily this initial experience of entertaining encouraged Marty Grosz
to bring his guitar out of the closet, and declare his intention to
become a musician.
The problem is that to make any kind of a living, jazz musicians are
obliged to travel, and play with guys they have usually just met.
Recording sessions are the only chance Grosz gets to prepare material
and work it over with a band of his own choosing. Grosz is a champion of
the lost song, he gets immense pleasure from tracking down and pepping
up arrangements of tunes he comes across in old, often forgotten,
movies. A recent CD featured the title song from a dreary 1936 skating
musical, One In a Million. Delivered from obscurity, the tune is now, as
Grosz points out, ''zippier than the movie''.
As well as assembling material and musicians, designing album covers,
and writing sleeve notes for CDs (a recent favourite is Songs I Learned
at my Mother's Knee and Other Low Joints), Grosz hatches a new band with
almost every recording. His penchant for inventing unusual bandnames
means that he has already led bands called The Orphan Newsboys,
Destiny's Tots, and the Paswonky Serenaders.
It has proved less easy to find musicians desperate to sign up as
members of The Bourgeois Scum or The Obsequious Toadies, but as long as
Grosz continues to uncover musical treasures from among the millions
routinely churned out in the twenties and thirties, you can bet that
this world-class, world-wandering, jazz jester won't be swapping his
guitar for a bus pass. There would be too many disappointed fans if he
did.
* Marty Grosz plays the Edinburgh International Jazz Festival on
Wednesday, August 9 and Thursday, August 10; then the Nairn
International Jazz Festival from August 16-18.

After a lot of promises, Tommy Lee Jones has arrived, in a big way,
via Gotham City, as Douglas Thompson explains
Jones's own face is an honest one which appears to have seen more than
one day at a time.
HE'S not a man you feel you should interrupt when he's playing with a
bottle of Budweiser -- no glass -- and a few words. They can be pleasant
pastimes but Tommy Lee Jones appears to be someone who takes everything
seriously. But, as in Chinatown, nothing is as it seems.
In the ego-revolving world of Hollywood this one-time oil field worker
and Harvard graduate -- and former room mate of American Vice-President
Al Gore -- who talks in an accent as thick as a Dallas traffic jam, is
one of the leading men of the moment but without the usual posing. Or
posturing.
Oh, he's snapping at Harrison Ford's heels -- as he was in his
Oscar-winning performance in The Fugitive -- and might not be getting
the Tom Cruise and Michael Douglas offers but Tommy Lee Jones is a
grown-up star. He has arrived. In a big way. After a lot of promises.
He's the original combustible cowboy who, at 48, has made more than 40
movies and appeared in landmark television productions like The
Executioner's Song -- as the ''I want to die'' killer Gary Gilmore --
and most memorably in 1989's epic western saga Lonesome Dove. From a
cast of hundreds, including Robert Duvall and Anjelica Huston, he stole
the show by saying very little indeed.
He's got a more difficult task this summer if he wants to get accused
of felony scene larceny. Now, it's more maniacal cackle than dialogue in
Batman Forever. In the third and remodelled of the Batman adventures
(the first two have grossed more than $700m) he appears as Harvey
Two-Face. A trifle of an acid accident turned half his face purple and
peculiar and made all of him a very bad boy indeed. This is The Joker
with more than a split personality.
But also around to confuse the Caped Crusader is The Riddler (aka
Edward Nigma) who is brought to life by another hot star, Jim Carrey,
who earlier this year was voted by America's youngsters (aged 14-19) as
their best actor. Carrey won his fan club for Ace Ventura: Private
Detective, The Mask, and the present release Dumb and Dumber.
But for Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones that was all a run-up for the
world-wide attention and exposure and money-machine of Batman Forever.
Director Joel Schumacher has taken over control of the fantasy franchise
from Tim Burton. The wunderkind Burton gave us a Dark Knight much in
contrast to the camp sixties television Batman and the comic (rather
than comic book) Saturday morning matinee antics of many yesterdays.
In turn, Schumacher is giving us his version of the good and bad
colourful celebrities of Gotham City. And to help Batman (the younger
Val Kilmer replacing Michael Keaton) compete with Harvey and The Riddler
we finally get to see Robin (Chris Scent of a Woman O'Donnell) complete
the Dynamic Duo for the first time since the new adventures began.
Burton's films were termed ''Gothic'' but Jones says that ''isn't
appropriate'' for the new movie. ''It's spectacular and it's rather, you
know, arch . . .''
Now, at first appearances you wouldn't place ''arch'' in Jones's
vocabulary. But here he is playing naughty games with two fellows in
capes and gender-defining bodysuits. He has a black pistol in one hand,
a silver one in the other. The crazed grin spreads across his face, it
just changes colour halfway there.
Jones's own face is an honest one which appears to have seen more than
one day at a time. It is like a relentlessly over-violent volcano,
potholes and creases everywhere. It didn't prevent his Tommy Lee Spruce
of films which has headlined him in and through the 1990s. He is
naturally taciturn about it. His friend, the singer Willie Nelson,
jokingly explains: ''Tommy Lee always thought he was a household name.''
But the work ethic has always been there. It's, he says, like being
thrown from a horse. If you can't ride him without spurs, don't get back
on. The critics have usually adored him and now the public -- as much
through his television work as his films -- knows him. But he will keep
getting back in the saddle.
After scoring, to most people's pleasure, the Best Supporting Oscar
for his obsessed Marshal Gerard in The Fugitive -- he gave another great
performance accepting his statuette, saying: ''The only thing a man can
say at a time like this . . . I am not really bald'' -- he reported not
to the champagne reception but to bed and work the next morning at 6am.
His head was shaved for his role as American baseball's haunted hero,
the mean Ty Cobb. In the biographical film, Jones makes you care for it
not like the violent, boozy, sporting God. He narrowly missed another
Oscar nomination.
Before it was The Client, the hat-trick of film adaptations of
bestselling author John Grishman's legal tangles, with Susan Sarandon
protecting a young witness and Jones supplying the goods as a
publicity-crazed Federal prosecutor. He was also a wily Irish bomber
matching tactics with Jeff Bridges's Boston bomb squad officer in Blown
Away. And in Natural Born Killers, as the prison warden, he was part of
an ensemble cast including Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis in Oliver
Stone's satire about love and violence and the American media. Natural
Born Killers was another major as well as controversial landmark in
Jones's career.
Every director and producer you talk to wants to work with him. He's
not very sure: ''I've called home and said 'I'm making the best movie
I've ever made -- possibly the best movie that's ever been made in the
history of the media'. And then it turns out to be a howling pooch.''
He's an eighth-generation Texan -- ''I just don't like to get very far
from a horse'' -- and a remarkably civilised man. He likes Oliver Stone
because he gets every literary reference Jones makes. He was a
scholarship lad at Harvard (his father did OK but not wonderful, working
a driller on the world's oil fields) and appreciates his learning.
This spring it was his 15th wedding anniversary to the former
Kimberlea Cloughley, now known to all around San Saba, Texas, as Mrs
Jones. The town 150 miles north of San Antonio is the closest to Jones's
3000-acre ranch: ''Being a cattleman is as creative as acting.
Agriculture is an art. Things don't grow automatically. If they did we
wouldn't have overgrazed this country and seen all the erosion.''
Jones looks and talks tough but when you ask his wife she says: ''He
has a very rough-looking face and maybe a rough demeanour but he's a
sweetheart inside.''
Well, she can ask him to put down his Budweiser and offer a few words.
''I get bored defending myself against charges of being sullen,
morose, and belligerent,'' says Jones before offering: ''And in fact you
piss me off.'' Ah Mr Jones is brightening up.
He's really quite a funny man. He played American football at
university and admits: ''It's only beginning to dawn on me that I'm
never actually going to play for the Dallas Cowboys.'' Instead he is one
of America's best polo players with a string of horses and his own
fields near the home he shares with his 36-year-old wife and their two
children, Austin, 12, and four-year-old Victoria.
He's a character. Asked the size of his ranch he replies: ''Are you
asking me how much money is in my bank account? Although I won't offer
any statistics I will tell you that I'm not fooling around.''
His film work is important but he says: ''Over the years it's made me
famous and by any standards well-to-do. But I usually don't pay much
attention to the glorification.''
He prefers simpler things: ''I've talked myself into believing I
remember the day that I was born. I hang on to my memories with cat's
claws. I can remember tornadoes in Knox County when I was three. We were
living in a trailer next to the hospital and near a cotton field. The
tornado jumped over our trailer and hit the hospital. I remember seeing
X-rays from the hospital floating down over the cotton plants in bloom.
''Some of my memories are clear -- very clear. Both my mother and
father used to go to honkytonk bars to do what everybody in that part of
Texas did -- drink. I'd wait for them outside in the car, alone. I
remember hearing music and singing coming through the walls of the
saloon to me in the car. I remember lying there just waiting, just
waiting alone.''
As an actor he has always been admired but he has waited for the
attention he's getting now. Andrew Davis, who directed him in The
Fugitive, is a fan. ''You can do nine takes with him and they'll all be
different and all be fascinating. He loves acting. He has the veneer of
a tough guy, his face and voice are very strong, but he can play a soft,
gentle character very well.''
Jones is asked why he goes on acting when it would appear he's happier
in the real saddle: ''The simple answer is it seemed like fun. The
complicated answer is it has to do with an enjoyment of and a necessity
for a vital imagination. But I'm not that analytical. I'll stick with
the simple answer. It's fun.''
Which is, he says, what Batman Forever is all about.
There are all sorts of freaky and weird gadgets used by the same sort
of characters. Jones talks of Harvey Two-Face like just another member
of his repertory. He's simply ''Harvey''. And Jones/Harvey like the
movie: ''The Batmobile drives into a wall and straight up it. I think
that's pretty cool.''
''Arch'' and now ''cool''. Another Budweiser? But Jones is wary of
some items: ''I don't want anything to do with the machine that robs
people's brain waves. It transfers them directly to Edward Nigma's
(that's The Riddler's) brain. I don't want that in my toy box.
''Acting silly and villainous was fun -- and playing this strange
character, especially jumping around with Jim Carrey.
''One day you're jumping out of the helicopter into an airbag. The
next day a big steel ball is crashing through the wall. The next day
you're speeding down an alley towards some blazing car crash. At other
times your character is impersonating an old homeless lady pushing a
shopping cart with a baby in it. I mean pick any day. It was a lot of
fun. Really.''
Nicole Kidman (aka Mrs Tom Cruise) changes style from a leggy redhead
to a leggy blonde to play Batman's ''love interest'' Dr Chase Merican.
The busty (it's a Wonderbra) doctor finds herself filling the space
between Batman and Robin. Well, what is the relationship between Batman
and the Boy Wonder?
Jones's view: ''I think it's Socratic. Batman is the teacher, leader.
And Robin is a good student. Yeah, I think it's a very decent,
all-American relationship.''
Batman Forever is expected to make something more than $400m at the
box office. The expectation is that big. There will be pots of millions
more from marketing, including everything from Harvey Two-Face dolls to
a fast food franchise link-up.
That, of course, is fun too for Mr Jones.
He's more glee than threatening about that. And there will be a Batman
4 and he would like to be part of it; ''I hope Harvey's back, the
Riddler's back. I hope all the villains are back. I feel certain that
good will triumph over evil even if they are coming back. That's all I
can say.''
So, in Batman Forever what you see is, like Chinatown, not always as
it seems? Jones does not reveal secrets, except to say: ''I want to play
Two-Face in the next Batman.''
These days Tommy Lee Jones tends to have his wishes granted. And it
can only be a bonus for the producers. He's safe hands.
Bill Wittliff was the writer-producer of Lonesome Dove which was an
enormous logistical undertaking. He recalled: ''Tommy Lee is somebody
you could trust with anything. There is a saying in Texas 'He'll do to
ride the river with.' That's Tommy Lee.
''Smooth water, rough water, you can depend on him.''
Hollywood's diving rod has got that message.

Since Nirvana's Kurt Cobain died, pop fans have cast about for a new
hero. BRIAN McIVER names candidates
FROM the moody mystique of Elvis Presley to the anti-Christ of Johnny
Rotten, pop music has always provided us with heroes. In the fifties it
was Cliff Richard and Elvis, while the sixties brought us Lennon and
McCartney, Mick Jagger and Jim Morrison. The seventies had John(ny
Rotten) Lydon, David Bowie and Marc Bolan, whereas 1980s heroes were
George Michael, Jim Kerr and Morrisey.
All were icons larger than life and instantly recognizable as heroes
who reflected and influenced the style and mood of a generation.
However, in this loser-slacker-Generation-X decade there is a distinct
lack of musical heroism, so who do today's pop pickers idolise?
Here is a guide to the most likely contenders to Live Forever.
* Liam Gallagher, Oasis
UP FIRST is the most likely of the lads, Liam Gallagher, the
loudmouthed Mancunian headcase singer of Oasis -- arguably the biggest
band in Britain. The remarkable success and popularity of Oasis (four
top 10 singles, one No 1, and the biggest selling debut album in
history), combined with Gallagher's hardman image and his detached,
petulant good looks make him the lust object of many.

* Damon Albarn, Blur
SINCE the phenomenal success of Blur's Parklife album last year, Damon
has become, along with Liam and Noel, one of the biggest stars of
Britpop. What makes this Colchester-bred art school-starlet a heavy
contender for hero-ship is the resounding commonality that he exudes.
Despite his boyish looks, he is very much seen as the beer-swilling new
pop man of the people.
Blur made the transition from good well-liked band to rock
superstars when they won four record breaking Brit awards earlier this
year, and they recently played to 20,000 people at London's Mile End
Stadium. They are also due to play Glasgow's SECC on November 28.
Potential Worship Rating:
nine out of 10.
* Jarvis Cocker, Pulp
THE tall, lanky superstar from the Sheffield council estates knows
where he's from and revels in it. Jarvis's enigmatic style and stage
persona have taken the band out of the murky indie scene to the verge of
superstardom. The last Pulp single, Common People, was the best to date
and made the top three. The band also managed to emerge victorious from
a last-minute headlining slot at this year's Glastonbury festival,
standing in for the Stone Roses. Facing a potentially hostile crowd,
Jarvis won them over and became the star of the weekend.
Potential Worship Rating:
10 out of 10.
* Gaz Coombes, Supergrass
ADOLESCENT singer/guitarist Gaz and his two Supergrass chums from
Oxford are the young pretenders to pop heroism. His first two singles,
Caught by the Fuzz and Mansize Rooster, caused such a stir that the
Monkey-resembling-man was on music press covers everywhere and the debut
album, I Should Coco, entered the charts in the Top five. Gaz's icon
potential was inflated some when earlier this year Calvin Klein asked
him to be an underwear pin-up, preferring the small skinny hairy crooner
to previous model, rapper Marky Mark. Gaz declined.
Potential Worship Rating:
nine out of 10.
* Justine Frisschman, Elastica
THE fawning Miss Frisschman is the first heroine of Britpop and plays
the sophisticated Princess to boyfriend Damon Albarn's Clown Prince. Her
band's punky and eponymous album was released this year, after a
succession of hit singles and magazine covers. Fortunately for her and
the rest of the band, she is gradually throwing off the Liz Hurleyesque
fame-by-association criticism and is now a star in her own right. Her
very English sexuality and attitude guarantee her good pin up-abilty and
heroine-ship.
Potential Worship rating:
eight out of 10.
* Tricky
THE latest British star, although his music is Trip-hop, which is a
fusion of hip hop and ambient dance music. His debut album, Maxinquaye,
is the critical success of the year, and he, following a world tour with
PJ Harvey, is currently earning rave reviews on the festival circuit,
which will include a spot at T in the Park.
His popularity is rising all the time, and his very infectious,
yet restrained stage manner, is winning him fans everywhere. His shaved
aerodynamic Michael Jordan look gets the girls while his co-vocalist
Martina is absolutely stunning.
Potential Worship Rating:
10 out of 10.
* Tricky, Elastica and Supergrass play T in the Park August 5/6, Blur
play Glasgow SECC November 28 and Pulp play Glasgow Barrowlands, October
1.

Following last weekend's
brutal killings
that shocked
every parent in
the country,
Ruth Wishart mourns the nation's loss of a happy childhood.
YOU can imagine the excitement beforehand. Not having to sleep inside
the house in a bedroom. Not having to observe any of the really silly
rules about what you can eat after your teeth are brushed, or when you
can stop gossiping and go to sleep. Camping out, even in the garden, has
always held a special fascination for children. In your mind the tent is
pitched anywhere you want it to be and in those strange surroundings,
with all the unfamiliar sounds of the night, you can imagine the most
wonderful adventures. But Sophie Hook will never weave those special
childhood fantasies again. And up and down the country thousands of
mothers will take yet another childhood treat off the menu.
However astronomical the odds against the same thing happening to a
similar child in a quite different part of the country, what mother,
contemplating the only too imaginable agonies of Sophie's family, could
ever take the risk that her backyard too might become the target of
someone capable of raping and killing a child?
And what of the families of Robert Gee and Paul Barker? What more
comforting a sight than boys of 12 and 13 not locked into the inanities
of computer games, not lying indolently in their holiday beds, but
setting off on that most traditional of summer treats, the
all-boys-together fishing expedition. Before this week what parent
wouldn't have looked on such a venture with fond indulgence? After it,
who will ever draw an easy breath during their children's absence?
Slowly and steadily and iniquitously young people are being robbed of
the most innocent of childhood pleasures, by a society now surely guilty
of grand larceny.
A child is abducted from a shopping complex by two older boys and is
found killed. And suddenly you hardly see a toddler without restraining
reins, or clasped reluctantly to his mother's hand. In the un-Scottish
heat of these summer nights it was once commonplace to find the streets
full of youngsters engaged in all kinds of sports or swapping secrets
with this week's bosom friends.
For my generation there was the briefest of pauses to pick up some
sustenance from the kitchen before disappearing after school, only to
return to the fold when bad light or intimations of more sustenance
stopped play. I doubt it ever occurred to my most assiduous of mothers
to look out the window to check on her offspring before the family tea
was on the table, or to give a moment's consideration to likely dangers.
Only once was I spanked by my father -- for straying on to a forbidden
railway line. And with the maturity of hindsight I recognise that his
uncharacteristic rage was fuelled by love and terror of what might have
been the result of such careless disobedience.
I appreciate too that while my by then widowed mother may not have
rejoiced in a teenage daughter who hammered all over Europe in a
battered jalopy, she was much more exercised by a skimpy knowledge of
geography and mechanics than the thought of the campsites being awash
with potential rapists.
Now the full horrors of cases like the Robert Black trial have etched
all kinds of other dangers indelibly into the soul of mothers and
fathers everywhere. Every parent you meet struggles with the seemingly
irreconcilable imperatives of allowing their children to grow while
keeping them safe from crimes of violence made the more terrible by
their apparent frequency.
I used to believe, I still want to, that the number of people with
psychopathic personalities -- people without the ability to separate
good and evil -- is very tiny. That the likelihood of their causing
damage to any of the young people in my ken is surely remote. Yet now it
seems we have to add to that tally of people with that psychotic
disorder a whole new cast list.
People with other serious mental illnesses who have been discharged
without proper supervision of the medication which allows them to
function reasonably normally. People drawn into a variety of drug
cultures whose dependence may well be temporary, but for whom all bets
are off when they are high. And, perhaps even more depressingly, people
for whom the moral parameters were never drawn, and who apparently draw
pleasure from other people's pain.
Hardly surprising then that the recent report from Barnardo's found
that children were quite pessimistic about their future, but that their
parents were even more terrified for them.
Hardly surprising either that so many children's play areas have been
rendered effectively out of bounds because the age group for whom they
were designed are regularly terrorised by teenagers with no gainful
employment and no apparent stake in tomorrow.
You don't need a sophisticated grasp of psychology to appreciate that
a happy, secure childhood filled with new and absorbing experiences
provides an unmatchable foundation for adult relationships in work and
at home.
A childhood filled with precious memories is possibly the richest gift
we can bestow. How appalling then the thought that an entire generation
may be deprived of many parts of it.

ONCE upon a time summer holidays meant seven weeks of blissful freedom
from organised activites. The murder of three children enjoying the
innocent summer pleasures of camping and fishing in one foul weekend is
likely to curtail the fun for hundreds of thousands of others from now
onwards.
What bewildered parents must remember, as they wonder how a child can
be snatched from a tent in her own back garden, is that abduction,
sexual attack, and murder of children is rare. The fear, however, is
almost universal. The number of children who were victims of homicide or
died as a result of assault last year was five. All boys under the age
of 10, two were babies who were battered to death, one was stabbed, and
two were fatally assaulted. There is now widespread consensus that
children should be trained to protect themselves from danger.
Jane Kilpatrick, assistant director of Kidscape, a charity founded 10
years ago to teach children how to avoid danger and escape abuse, was
adamant that parents should not panic and overreact. ''We cannot lock
children up, we must give them some freedom because already this
generation is one of the most controlled we have ever had. They need to
be taught some practical strategies. We cannot keep children safe 100%
of the time, just as you cannot guarantee they will never be run over
but still teach them how to cross the road,'' she said.
The idea that dealing with danger should be part of everyday life, but
explained in a way which is not going to frighten children, is echoed by
Nancy Ovens, co-ordinator of the National Centre for Play at Moray House
College of Education in Edinburgh. ''From the adult's point of view,
safety has to be the first priority, but a very good definition of play
is that it is about risk management.
''Unstructured play offers children and young people opportunities for
testing themselves, examining risks, and solving problems. They may have
been given skills in a structured way in school and at home, but they
need to develop them by themselves. Children who have not learned how to
cope in different situations are going to be more at risk as adults.
''People might not think of sleeping out in a garden as play, but that
is just the kind of experience which children need to have, being
allowed to do something out of the ordinary -- and adults need to feel
confident about allowing them to do that. You cannot totally legislate
for safety but you can take a commonsense approach. You can, for
example, tell children to run if they feel scared,'' she said.
Kidscape advocates more definite rules, the most important of which is
never talk to people you don't know. Next is that it is OK to shout and
make a really big fuss if someone approaches you or you are scared.
Their slogan of Yell, Run, Tell is one they would like all children to
put into action automatically.
It is an approach which enrages Dr Mayer Hillman of the Policy Studies
Institute. He argues that the present generation is at greater risk of
early death from heart attack as a result of the curbs on their freedom
to walk and cycle about their daily business than they are of the
abduction or attack which prompts the restrictions. He argues that the
more zealous campaigners exacerbate the instinctive fears that all
parents have.
''By talking about dangers to the extent they do, enormous damage is
done to normal neighbourliness and community life, where children and
adults are too frightened to talk to each other.
''Responsible parents should tell children that there is a minute
chance that someone might want to do something foul to them, but they
should remember that most of these incidents involve someone who is
known to them. Every day 460 people die from heart disease, and the way
to prevent that is regular daily exercise which starts in childhood, so
every day the fear of a largely hypothetical danger makes early death a
much more likely danger,'' he said.
Another example of concern curtailing activities has come to light
this summer. Play schemes all across Scotland have reported a sharp drop
in volunteers because of more rigorous vetting procedures, including
police checks, required by the Children Act. Most regions have cut the
number of play schemes by between one-third and a half because of the
drop in volunteers.
Organisers, while welcoming the quality control, have blamed
increasing documentation as well as more women working part-time, for
the fall-off.
No doubt thousands of other boys went fishing at the weekend and
thousands of other girls had the thrill of sleeping under canvas. How
many were allowed to bike off with their pals for a picnic yesterday,
and how many will be allowed to sleep out tonight? Parents restrict
their children's freedom because it is a measure that is in their power
to take, but only society as a whole can restrict the freedom of its
misfits.

Stuart Trotter
reviews the career of Lib-Dem MP David Alton who has decided to quit.
DAVID Alton, erstwhile Liberal Democrat Chief Whip and a campaigner on
moral issues at Westminster, announced yesterday that he is to stand
down after 16 years as an MP in Liverpool.
His present Mossley Hill constituency has been abolished by the
Boundary Commission and none of the new seats in which it has been
merged looks likely to be won by his party.
He told constituency workers and supporters: ''This is the end of a
chapter but not the end of the book.'' He would continue to work for
policies, ''based on social concern allied to personal responsibility''
particularly in association with the Movement for Christian Democracy
which he co-founded in 1990 with members of all the main parties. He
intends to devote much of his time to expanding the movement after the
next election.
He said: ''I remain deeply critical of the trend towards the
politically correct, technocratic policies greased by vested interests
which we see across the political spectrum.''
Elected for Liverpool Edge Hill at a by-election just before the 1979
General Election he became the youngest MP, serving for six days before
having to fight off a Labour attempt to retake it.
He held the redrawn Mossley Hill seat in 1983 and increased his
majority at the two subsequent elections. Drastic surgery by the
Boundary Commission abolished the seat altogether for the next election.
A friend said: ''The commission succeeded where the opposition parties
never could.''
Alton, who is 44, had a spectacular success last year with a campaign
to control the distribution of gratuitously violent videos despite
initial Government opposition.
He had less success in 1987 with a private Member's Bill to further
limit late abortions although it received the highest second reading
vote of any Bill of its kind. He complained about ''procedural mugging''
by opponents who talked the Bill out.
A devout Roman Catholic -- married with three young children, a
daughter and two sons -- Alton has spoken up for distinctively
Judaeo-Christian values in politics, not always helped by a failure of
the religious bodies to agree among themselves.
He clashed with Paddy Ashdown over the party's decision, later
rescinded, to make a woman's right to choose abortion party policy, but
supported him on Bosnia and on the desirability of closer links with
Labour.
If a Labour Government was to introduce proportional representation a
return to Westminster politics by Alton could not be ruled out. PR might
allow someone standing as a Christian Democrat a better chance of being
elected. Ashdown said last night: ''David Alton established a wide
respect beyond Westminster and a moral authority across party political
boundaries. Parliament will be a less interesting, less
independent-minded place without him.''
Archy Kirkwood, a successor as Liberal Democrat Chief Whip, said Alton
was, ''one of the outstanding Parliamentary figures of his time''. He
easily passed the test of all political careers, he said -- he had made
a difference.

Tam Dalyell, disturbed by apparent official reluctance to pursue lines
of inquiry continues to press for vigorous action
ROBERT Black, professor of Scots Law in the University of Edinburgh
tells us that there is an absolute obligation under Scots Law for the
prosecuting authority in the form of the Crown Office to pursue any lead
that would exculpate or tend to exculpate those who are charged of a
major crime. In the case of the Libyan Two there are fears that this has
not occurred.
The Dumfries and Galloway Police and the Crown Office appear reluctant
to follow up leads which serious people believe solid enough to warrant
further investigation.
Let us begin with the case of Lester Coleman. He may not be the most
important witness to be interviewed but I start with Coleman simply
because he is the subject of current controversy.
In September 1993 he and Don Goddard published a book called The Trail
of the Octopus. In that book a number of very explicit allegations were
made about the connection between a drugs-run from Lebanon through
Cyprus where Coleman was based and the Rhine Main Airport at Frankfurt.
Coleman's critics accuse him of getting out of the United States to
avoid charges of procuring a passport under false pretences. I believe
that the passport charges were trumped up. However what Tam Dalyell
believes or does not believe in this particular context is not of great
importance. The important point is that the Scottish police should have
the opportunity to form their own judgment of Coleman as a witness.
The FBI has said that Coleman asked for a copy of a birth certificate
of a dead person -- Thomas Leavy -- with which to forge a false
passport. When friends of mine approached the relevant authority in New
London, Connecticut, they found that the American officials insisted
that no person of that name was born at the time claimed by the FBI. The
entire case seemed to be trumped up.
Coleman from his various hideouts in Europe has phoned me on many
occasions. I can only form a judgment that he has been a medium-level
agent telling the truth. I would like the Dumfries and Galloway Police
to have the same opportunity of quizzing Coleman but face to face.
Coleman's collaborator was Don Goddard. I know him well. He was for 10
years an associate editor of the New York Times. Goddard is by no
figment of the imagination anti-American. As Coleman's co-author he put
his reputation on the line. The Dumfries and Galloway Police have not
been prepared to talk to him properly in three years.
Again, why haven't they talked properly to the Swiss businessman Edwin
Bollier and his engineer Ulrich Lumpart? The British authorities have
declined even to show the crucial timing device to those who were
responsible for manufacturing that device.
My own suspicion shared by serious people is that the timing device
which the British say that they have was not the timing device that was
involved in that bringing down of the PanAm Clipper Maid of the Seas but
was substituted at a later stage. If Ministers are as sceptical of
Bollier as they told me that they are, how come that they relied on his
evidence when it suited them to do so?
Again the whole case involving the Malta connection depends on the
evidence of the shopkeeper at Mary's Shop in Valetta who sold the
garments which purported to suggest that the bomb was loaded in Malta.
His name was Toni Gauchi. He was interviewed by the Scottish police at
an early stage and has given 18 different accounts of what happened
including identification of a man whose description was 20 years
different from that of either of the accused Libyans.
Moreover the reluctance to talk sensibly to the Libyans has been
total. In 33 years as a member of the House of Commons I have never been
so angry as coming out of a meeting with then Lord Advocate Peter Fraser
when I tried to suggest that Scottish lawyers representing the Crown
Office should at least talk to the Libyans.
Dialogue would have seemed sensible with Arabs who understandably
thought that in the light of the Guildford Four or the Birmingham Six,
the Libyan Two would stand little chance.
I and many others have tried to persuade the Libyans that the Scottish
legal system would in our opinion be fair to them. However one can
understand their perceptions of a country with whom they have no
extradition treaty.
No effort has been made by the Scottish police to talk seriously to
the film maker Allan Francovich and his colleague John Ashton. Any
reader of The Herald who saw The Maltese Double Cross screened on
Channel 4 must surely conclude that at the very least it needed an
answer.
Any investigating authority anxious to get to the truth of who were
the perpetrators of the greatest crimes against Western civilians since
1945 would surely have asked Francovich and Ashton to sit down with
them. That has not happened.
Nor do I think that there has been any attempt to talk properly to the
Rt Hon Paul Channon.
Channon has been my parliamentary colleague for a third of a century
and I have known him well since he was Rab Butler's Parliamentary
Private Secretary. He is not a fool. He is not a liar. He is not a
maker-up of stories. When he was Secretary of State for Transport in
March 1989 he told a group of journalists at the Garrick Club that the
perpetrators of the Lockerbie crime would be identified within a week.
The journalists who reported what Channon had said were very
experienced professionals who certainly on such a topic would have no
misunderstandings whatsoever. Why haven't the police asked Channon on
what he based his statement as Secretary of State?
Above all why have not the police put some very direct questions to
Lady Thatcher? Is it not extraordinary that in 800-pages she mentioned
Lockerbie not once? What she did say was that the much vaunted ''Libyan
terrorist attack'' was never to take place, when she was defending her
indefensible permission to the Americans to launch a raid on Tripoli and
Bengazi from British soil.
The fact of the matter is that Reagan and Bush through Sir Charles Poe
asked Mrs Thatcher to play Lockerbie low-key. The police have a duty to
ask her why she complied with this extraordinary request.
I am conscious that people say to me -- why nag on about something
that happened over six and a half years ago? Of course there is a duty
to the relatives.
But the consequences of Lockerbie drag on. Sanctions are being imposed
against Libya. There is hurt to a people who have been Britain's
traditional friends, most of whose leaders were educated at British
universities. There is the damage to British industries which have lost
their traditional markets (ask the management of Babcocks about the
consequences of the loss of traditional Libyan orders) but above all
there is the ongoing consequences throughout Africa which prompted
Nelson Mandela to write to the British Prime Minister about our attitude
to Libya.

Even in the aftermath of the Tay tragedy coastguards are divided about
the need to legislate on small boat safety, as Alan Hunter discovers
FOR those in peril on the sea, there is no legislation covering safety
standards for small craft -- only advice and education, according to the
coastguard station which monitored the Firth of Tay tragedy -- and a
former coxswain with a lifetime's experience of the dangers of
Scotland's coasts.
Yet there is division on how legislation may be introduced, and to the
degree it should be extended.
The honorary secretary of Anstruther lifeboat station, Peter Murray,
former cox of The Doctors, now a museum piece in Buckie, said he
believed the public already faced too much legislation on aspects of
safety and that the only freedoms remaining were in the mountains and on
the seas.
Murray was emphatic that he attributed no blame for the Tay accident,
despite the fact that survivor John Miller admitted later that the craft
had no radio or flares, and just one life belt.
Murray thought it possible that Miller, with an experienced crew,
planned fully to equip his boat after berthing at Arbroath from
Newburgh.
The officer of the watch at Fife Ness Coastguard Station agreed but
took a different tack. Coastguards, he said, had been pushing for years
for proper legislation covering small craft around Britain's waters.
While declining to be named, he explained: ''We think legislation should
be introduced.
''It is like having a jack in the boot of your car which may never be
used.
''At sea, it is different. Proper equipment must always be used,
particularly a radio system, from which we can get cross-bearings and
take immediate action.
''Anyone can take a small boat to sea, and whether they are properly
equipped with radio, flares, compass, and proper survival gear is a
matter for them.''
The coastguard added that frequently he and his colleaguesbecome
disenchanted and disgusted by the stupidity of people who sailed in
Scottish waters.
''On one occasion recently we had a sailor in distress who had no
radio but called us on his mobile phone in fog.
''He could not give us his position, but with proper radio equipment
we could have taken cross-bearings and had a fix on him almost
immediately.
''On another occasion we were called out to a boat in distress, with
children on board, but without flares or radio.''
He felt that, unfortunately, anyone could buy a boat and take it to
sea, without legislation covering the essentials required, and that the
public was naive about aspects of safety.
Owing to the increase in recent incidents at sea, the Lifeboat Service
now operates search and rescue helicopters besides its fleet of boats.
They are based at Sumburgh, the Solent, and Stornoway, all equipped with
heat-seeking equipment which can be used in virtually any conditions,
which could be vital in saving lives.
Former coxswain Murray has a simple theory about those taking to small
boats.
''The sea is the boss, and must be respected,'' he said.
He still remembers the sandbanks of the Firth of Tay. The same
sandbank involved in the weekend incident claimed the lives of lifeboat
crewmen aboard The Mona, in one of the worst incidents in the history of
the service, in the fifties.
From his home in Anstruther, Murray said: ''The bottom line is that
people must realise that they must be properly equipped.
''I want to see people enjoying themselves, whether it be on the hills
or at sea. But they must be aware of the dangers. You would not, for
example, jump into a car with four bald tyres, so why go to sea without
the proper gear?''
Explaining his stance on safety legislation for small boats, he added:
''I think there is already too much legislation in this country. All we
have free today are the mountains and the seas and I am keen to have
people enjoying the sea, despite the fact that I have been involved in
many rescues.''
In the absence of legislation Murray maintains there is a simple
answer to those taking to the waters of Scotland's coast: common sense.
Britain's 240 lifeboat stations are readily available to give advice,
as are harbourmasters' offices -- with equipment including lifejackets,
flares, torches, VHF radios, and life belts available from ships'
chandlers at moderate cost.
''For #25 you can buy a lifejacket which is perfectly safe, although
they can cost over #100. Survival equipment should always be considered,
to prevent exposure in the water and to retain body heat.
''I know some sailors consider the wearing of lifejackets 'cissy', but
that is a wrong.
''Especially where children are being taken on board small craft,
their jackets should be of the correct size, with the straps properly
adjusted.
''It is the best life insurance anyone can buy.''
Another side of safety at sea, he asserted, was the proper maintenance
of boats.
''We are a nation of seamen, but we still find that when the summer
sailing season starts, boats have been badly maintained when out of the
water over the winter, with planks stretching and engines seizing up.''
He conceded, however, that mariners were becoming better educated,
mainly due to ongoing publicity by the lifeboat service.
Even the most experienced sailors could run into trouble, as his own
Anstruther rescue boat discovered recently.
One yachtsman, laying buoys for a race, found his anchor snagged in a
lobster-pot line, and despite his experience had to call in the lifeboat
by radio to pull him back to shore -- or face six hours in the sea,
waiting for the tide to change.

It is only four years since Scottish Opera was baled out by a
controversial payment of #500,000. Now the begging cap is out again and
Michael Tumelty claims the real crunch is not far away
WHATEVER the scale of problems faced immediately by the results of its
chorus's balloting for strike action, it is clear that, for Scottish
Opera, they represent the tip of an iceberg.
Two months ago I wrote that Scottish Opera was in deep trouble, that
it faced the threat of extinction before the end of the decade. I have
heard nothing since to persuade me to change that view. Indeed, the
final precipice may loom as soon as next month, depending on the outcome
of talks currently taking place between the opera company, the Royal
Scottish National and Scottish Chamber orchestras, and the Scottish Arts
Council, under the chairmanship of company doctor, Sir Lewis Robertson.
More of that anon.
Currently, Scottish Opera is awash with rumours. Principal among these
is the allegation that once again the company is in financial crisis,
and that -- sensationally -- it is actually running at the moment with a
huge deficit of #750,000.
That, said Roberta Doyle, head of marketing and press for Scottish
Opera, is categorically not the case. It is the case, however, she said
yesterday, that a deficit of that scale has been projected for the end
of the current financial year.
Again? The public would be justified in a sigh of exasperation at
least, as the country's full-time national opera company seems to teeter
from one financial crisis to the next. It's only four years since Ian
Lang, as Secretary of State, baled out Scottish Opera (to the fury of
every other arts company in Scotland) with a one-off payment of
#500,000.
Where do they come from, these crises that overtake the company in
regular cycles? Depending on which bar you haunt, you can hear every
rumour under the sun, from allegations of management ineptitude to hints
of an inbuilt antipathy by the new generation of Scottish Arts Council
officers towards spending vast sums on opera.
The opera company itself is quite certain of the root cause of the
recurring problem. And it is cited in every quote given out by its
general director Richard Jarman. Basic underfunding. Opera is an
extremely expensive commodity, runs the argument. Two examples from
recent years: a new production of Bellini's opera Norma cost #250,000;
Donizetti's Mary Stuart cost #200,000.
Opera? You want it, it has to be paid for. And the problem, asserts
the company, is that -- as far back as anyone can trace -- the company
has never had the full amount of money adequately to stage a full
programme of work. If that is the case -- and it is one argued by almost
every company in the land -- then, year on year, Scottish Opera
estimates that it is running with a budget that is something like
#750,000 short of adequate.
In recent years the company has received a number of one-off payments
-- from the Secretary of State (which carried the insistence of the
Scottish Office that no further deficits be accrued), and, in two
payments for the above-mentioned operas, from the Peter Moores
Foundation.
And that's part of the problem, says Scottish Opera. These payments
were, in a sense, cosmetic. They plugged gaps. They helped disguise the
fundamental shortfall in funding. This year there are no one-off
payments, and the problem has threatened to erupt like a boil, revealing
the massive deficit projected for the end of the current financial year.
''Projected,'' insisted Scottish Opera's Roberta Doyle, yesterday. A
range of measures has been implemented to tackle the issue. These
include the company pay freeze that led directly to the strife within
the chorus. The freeze is estimated to save around #150,000. On top of
that, a number of administrative posts that have fallen vacant in the
company have not been filled.
Then there is the programme of work. The new season, with only seven
operas, is -- as I said when it was announced -- rather meagre. Eight
were originally scheduled. A revival of the company's production of
Janacek's House of the Dead was removed to save money. Scottish Opera
yesterday stated that the saving would be #100,000.
Additionally, the opera company has applied for #1.3m lottery money to
build a shed in Garscube Road that would draw together components of its
operation -- construction and storage of stage sets, rehearsal
facilities and wardrobe -- that are currently in premises scattered all
over the city. Savings in rent from such a rationalisation are estimated
at #125,000.
And on top of all that, in the words of the company yesterday,
''representations are being made to institutions in Scotland and beyond
to make up the deficit''. In other words, Scottish Opera is out with the
begging cap. (There is a strong rumour that this has included a letter
directly to John Major.)
However, if indeed the problem is a structural one, and the company is
actually short of the basic money to run its operation, then that
problem will return, and all these measures themselves are merely
cosmetic.
And to make matters worse, this is in a climate where Scottish Opera's
revenue grant from the Scottish Arts Council was frozen last year, went
up by 2% this year (less than the rate of inflation and the rise in the
cost of living) and is predicted to remain at a standstill for the
forseeable future.
In other words, Scottish Opera is trapped in a spiral. But that's not
the half of it. In September, the working party of the big three music
companies, formed at the insistence of the Scottish Arts Council (though
the SAC denies that it is in the driving seat), is due to report.
This is an extraordinary business. The Royal SNO, the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra, and Scottish Opera have been instructed to sit down with a
blank sheet of paper and see if they can come with collaborative
ventures. (The two orchestras already do this.)
If they cannot produce anything -- and, specifically in this case, if
there is nothing directly to the advantage of Scottish Opera (and
remember we are talking about a company that is looking for permanent
additional annual income in the region of #750,000) then that might well
prove the straw that break's the camel's back; and the last straw for
the paymasters of the Scottish Arts Council.
On the eve of an Edinburgh Festival that might well be opening without
Scottish Opera (and this will be catastrophic for the credibility of the
company) even an optimist would find it hard to see a long-term future
for a full-time opera house in this country.

Graham Ogilvy assesses rising concern among families, and politicians,
as selling elderly relatives' homes to pay for long-term care becomes
commonplace
The business of taking away people's houses is not Conservatism
FORTY thousand families lost their inheritance last year when their
elderly parents' homes were sold to pay for long-term care. An estimated
#2500m was removed from the nation's inheritance, not by the punitive
death duties or capital gains tax favoured by the left. It was removed
by what some Tories now believe was a short-sighted policy of the
buccaneering right to transfer responsibility to the individual for care
in old age.
That policy -- of reduction in NHS long-stay beds, and the transfer of
care for the elderly to the profit-making private sector and an
under-funded public sector -- now threatens to torpedo the Thatcherite
vision of a property-owning democracy in which wealth ''cascades down
the generations'' of a ''nation of inheritors''.
As social work directors are given more powers to seize the houses and
assets owned by the elderly to pay for their care, it is an irony that
is not lost on some Conservatives.
They fear an electoral backlash as the message gets through to the
fiftysomethings of Middle England that their long-anticipated windfall
will be dissipated to pay nursing home charges for elderly relatives.
Tory councillor Daphne Sleigh, leader of the Conservative group on
Edinburgh District Council, failed at this year's Scottish Conservative
Party conference to have a resolution passed calling for an increase in
the means test threshold for pensioners' savings to be increased from
#8000 to #50,000, above which pensioners must pay in full for their
care.
She speaks for privet-hedged, home-owning suburbia when she
passionately states: ''I'm very disturbed at what is happening. We
should send a clear message to the Prime Minister that this is a huge
problem.
''I'm sure that every constituency has complaints about this issue.
This is simply not a Conservative way of doing things.
''The business of taking away people's houses is not Conservatism. It
is not even socialism, it is more akin to communism.''
She added: ''The Prime Minister and the Conservative Party have
encouraged people to become home-owners and made it possible for tenants
to buy their council houses. Many people who scrimped and saved have
suddenly discovered that they have had to give up their homes, forfeit
pensions, and are left only with pocket money.''
Her arguments are formidably underpinned by Professor Chris Hamnett,
of King's College, London University.
He has undertaken research at the behest of PPP Lifetime, a company
selling long-term care insurance, which finds that, despite the huge
growth in home ownership during the past 25 years, the number of houses
inherited has remained largely unchanged for a quarter of a century.
Professor Hamnett, head of human geography at King's, based his report
published last week on Inland Revenue figures.
In 1989-90 the Revenue statistics show that (excluding transfers to
spouses) 101,000 estates were passed on at death compared with earlier
estimates of 133,000.
With the numbers of over-eighties rising steadily, growing numbers of
the elderly are finding that their pensions are not sufficient to fund
their care and that they must sell their house -- or have it sold for
them by the local council.
Unsurprisingly, what started as a trickle of clients visiting their
solicitors to inquire about the protection of assets from the local
representatives of the state has been steadily growing during the past
year.
Nick Barclay, a partner specialising in wills at Thornton WS
solicitors, says: ''We have been seeing an increase in people asking
about gifting assets, including private assets, before they go into
residential care.
''Previously, we hardly had anyone asking about this, but it's around
one a week at the moment.''
He said people were concerned that the family home would have to be
sold to pay for residential care, and they were asking to have the title
transferred into the names of their children.
In his capacity as president of the Association of Social Work
Directors in Scotland, Peter Bates believes it will become a major
political issue at the next General Election.
Recently he was astonished when he turned up to address a public
meeting on the subject. Expecting a crowd of 30 or 40 he was confronted
by 400 angry senior citizens.
He recalls: ''They were furious at having contributed in National
Insurance and tax over the decades only to face new demands in their old
age. They were angry that war service and sacrifice seemed to them to
count for so little, and they were particularly upset at the increase in
the older population being regarded as a 'problem' rather than an
achievement.''
In Tayside, where Bates is empowered to order pensioners' homes to be
sold, less than 25% of the elderly in care are in local authority homes.
Left to balance the underfunded poisoned chalice of community care, he
has no choice but to send people to expensive private nursing homes.
But Scottish Tory Chairman Sir Michael Hirst is leaving open a chink
of hope. He said: ''I keenly understand the anxiety which exists. I
expect this issue to figure quite prominently in the major consultation
exercise that the party has embarked upon.''
But he warned: ''There has been a huge growth in the number of elderly
people in residential and nursing home care. I don't think the taxpayer
can be expected to meet that escalating cost evermore.''

<HEADLINE>Brain-damaged child who is blind, deaf, and helpless is to be made a ward of court. Couple's first step in bid to let son die</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977109073</RECORDNO>

BRAIN-DAMAGED Thomas Creedon was yesterday made a ward of court as the
first stage of legal proceedings by his parents to allow their son to
die.
At a private hearing, a High Court judge ruled the 22-month-old boy
should be made a ward and, although he will remain at home, doctors must
seek permission from the courts for any changes to his treatment.
Thomas's parents, Fiona and Con Creedon, will now seek further medical
evidence for a case to be put to the High Court that their son should
not be kept alive artificially but should be allowed to die.
Mr and Mrs Creedon were not in court for the hearing but their
solicitor told reporters outside that he hoped the case would be heard
later this year.
Thomas was brain-damaged in the womb, is blind and deaf, and has no
control over his limbs. He cries inconsolably, has constant fits, and is
fed through a hole in his stomach.
The president of the High Court's family division, Sir Stephen Brown,
said he had the ''very greatest sympathy and understanding for the
parents of this tragic boy''.
Mr Creedon will now have to file an application for his son to be made
a ward of court in the next 48 hours, although legal representatives
stressed this was just a technicality.
Thomas will remain at his home in Hull receiving treatment from a
consultant and a team of carers and in the care and control of his
parents.
Any change to his treatment will now have to be approved by the
courts, Sir Stephen ordered.
Thomas will also continue to be treated on occasions at a hospital in
Humberside, which cannot be named, where he receives specialist care for
his condition, which Sir Stephen said was unlikely to improve.
The Creedons' solicitor, Mr John Burman, would not comment on
yesterday's proceedings but said Thomas's parents would now press ahead
with gathering further medical evidence for a hearing which may take
place in September or October.
Explaining the wardship decision, Mr Burman said: ''This simply
provides a mechanism by which the case can be heard and can proceed.
''The actual wardship application will be made in the next 48 hours
and from then it will be a question of further medical evidence being
gathered.
''The case will not proceed in any substantive way until that stage.''
The official solicitor, Peter Harris, acting for the child, was named
by the court as a respondent in any further proceedings.
The two NHS trusts who are responsible for Thomas's care and cannot be
named were also listed as respondents along with Humberside Council.
Sir Stephen said the trusts shared a heavy burden of responsibility
with Thomas's parents and the wardship order aimed to remove some of
that burden.
''The court is concerned for the protection and welfare of Thomas and
also to assist the parents in the desperately anxious and tragic
situation in which they find themselves,'' he added.
Sir Stephen expressed a hope that media coverage of the tragic case
would show sensitivity and understanding for the parents and Thomas's
carers and ordered that the trusts should not be named in any reporting
of the case.
He also ordered that information about the case or Thomas's condition
should not be obtained from any other sources except Mr and Mrs Creedon.
Yesterday's preliminary ruling follows the decision by the Irish
Supreme Court last week to allow a family to let their daughter die
after 20 years in a coma.
In a majority verdict, the five judges of the court, the Irish
Republic's ultimate legal authority, backed an earlier Dublin High Court
decision.
The woman, now aged 45, sustained severe brain damage when her heart
stopped during a routine operation at the age of 22 and had been in a
permanent vegetative state and was fed through a tube, although she was
able to recognise people at times.

HOUSEBREAKER William Bett's escape was halted by a tackle from a
teenage rugby coach.
Bett, 20, was trying to escape after breaking into a house near
Edinburgh's Boroughmuir rugby club.
Seventeen-year-old George Reid, of Braid Avenue, Edinburgh, who was
out coaching youngsters from Boroughmuir High School, intervened when
Bett ran off after police were called to the crime scene.
Depute-Fiscal Neil Allan told Edinburgh Sheriff Court: ''He put his
apparent expert knowledge of the game to particular use and brought him
down with an almighty thump.
''It was described as a firm rugby tackle,'' Mr Allan told Sheriff
Isobel Poole.
Yesterday, Bett was sentenced to eighteen months in jail by the
sheriff.
He and co-accused Paul Cameron, 23, both described as prisoners,
earlier had admitted breaking into a house in North Meggetland,
Edinburgh, on March 9 this year and stealing cash, jewellery, and other
items worth more than #2200.
Bett also admitted stealing #8500 worth of jewellery and money from a
68-year-old woman's home in Allan Park Loan, in Edinburgh, in February
this year.
Cameron also pleaded guilty to breaking into a house in Woodfield
Avenue in the city on March 6 and stealing goods worth #8000.
He was sentenced to two years in jail by Sheriff Poole.
Mr Allan told the court that the duo's crime spree ended when they
targetted a house in a development near the rugby club.
The woman of the house returned to find a rear window smashed and
after hearing footsteps in a bedroom went next door to call the police.
Police saw Cameron in bushes nearby and Bett was spotted running away
before Mr Reid intervened.

SCOTLAND'S first private prison moved a step closer yesterday with the
disclosure that the Scottish Prison Service has engaged a planning
consultancy to identify and explore possible sites.
The 500-place jail will be financed, designed, built, and run
privately and could be up and running within three years. If current
projections by SPS experts prove correct and the Scottish prison
population climbs over the 6000 mark by 1998, a second private jail is
likely to follow very quickly.
The project has been on the stocks for some time with a site beside
the existing Low Moss Prison, near Bishopbriggs, as the most likely
option.
There were indications from the Scottish Office yesterday that the
overt support of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, who was Prisons
Minister for England and Wales in his capacity as number two at the Home
Office until his promotion, has boosted the programme. He will still
have to approve the business case presented by the SPS.
Mr Forsyth made it plain in his interview in last week's Herald that
he sees private participation as the best option for the penal system.
He said then that from English experience he found that a privately
built prison cost half as much and was built twice as quickly than in
the old way.
When prison officers were consulted, he claimed, they said private
prisons were easier to run and more cost effective and that, he said,
was the way forward.
The SPS is indicating that the case for a new prison in west Central
Scotland is becoming pressing. Scotland's 21 jails house 5500 people in
capacity for 5200, with some local jails heavily overcrowded. Current
juggling with underused capacity at Cornton Vale and Castle Huntly will
ease overcrowded remand facilities but will not tackle long-term
problems. On top of that, much of the prison estate is Victorian.
The numbers are projected to rise to 5750 this year, 5900 in 1996/97,
and 6100 the following year. The private 500-prisoner jail, built to
take up to B-category prisoners, would still leave the system
overcrowded, making a second private facility almost inevitable.
In common with England, where a number of private prisons are already
running, with several more planned, the tendering competition is
expected to be strong both from existing consortia and from groups of
Scottish companies. The consortia usually consists of a building firm
allied with a security company with jail experience and a financial
company.
Drawing on English experience, SPS sources indicate that the
successful bidder could expect a 25-year contract.
The planning consultancy, Montagu Evans, has been engaged to examine
sites identified by the SPS, including some in the agency's existing
land bank and others in private ownership. Montagu Evans will then carry
out site exploration and submit planning applications.

JOBS at an Ayrshire foundry, which is in the hands of the receiver,
may be threatened by the failure of Scottish Enterprise to assist in an
early rescue operation.
There are also fears that creditors of the James Dickie Foundry will
lose more than one third of what they are owed if a new company takes
over.
Now South of Scotland Euro-MP Alex Smith is calling for an inquiry
into the role of Scottish Enterprise's investment group in early efforts
to save the firm.
The company's management was experiencing cash- flow difficulties
earlier this year and sought assistance from Scottish Enterprise and the
private investment company 3i plc.
It was not considered feasible then to put together a rescue package
and an examination of the company at that time is understood to have
identified problems with management structure.
Within weeks, the company was put in the hands of receivers Moores
Rowland and Mr Douglas Jackson set about finding a new buyer.
He said: ''Negotiations are at an advanced stage and I am hopeful that
an agreement can be reached in the very near future.''
It has emerged SE has helped Glasgow-based firm Duramet to allow it to
put together a takeover bid. There appears to be only one other
potential bidder, HKB Steels from the Midlands.
Union officials are concerned that the Scottish bid will give no
guarantee for the 90 jobs at the foundry in Ayr's Somerset Road.
Mr Smith said: ''I am surprised and concerned at what appears to have
been a cynical approach taken by Scottish Enterprise to the initial
rescue bid. I understand that they stepped back because of the
possibility of becoming liable for the debts of the company.
''Now it appears they are back in the game and have taken a stake of
around 20% in the company which wants to bid for the company.''
He is concerned that the agency is failing to operate a level playing
field for all potential bidders and that public money should not be
spent in supporting one private company against another.
Mr Andy Spence, of 3i in Glasgow, said he could not comment as the
issue is commercially sensitive.
A Scottish Enterprise spokesman said: ''As was fully explained to Mr
Smith when he was briefed on this matter a few days ago, SDF (SE's
commercial investment arm), was very keen to help this firm and carried
out detailed pre-investment appraisal work to ascertain the company's
position.
''Unfortunately, this showed their financial position to be extremely
precarious and on a scale which made the company unviable. In addition,
SDF was concerned about a number of operational issues. It reluctantly
concluded it was unable to invest public money in the company.
''SDF is hopeful, however, that a buyer can be found to take the
business forward.''

<TEXT>
TWO sisters have lost their battle for contempt of court proceedings
to be launched against newspapers which published ''prejudicial and
sensationalised'' reports of their trial for murder.
The High Court ruled yesterday that the decision of senior law
officers refusing to take legal action was not open to legal challenge.
Lord Justice Stuart Smith, sitting with Mr Justice Butterfield, said
even if they had had jurisdiction to intervene they would not have done
so as the decision not to prosecute was neither ''irrational nor
unlawful''.
Mr Justice Butterield said that, after anxious consideration, he
agreed -- even though offending newspapers had ''crossed the acceptable
limits of fair and accurate reporting by a substantial margin''.
Michelle and Lisa Taylor wanted prosecutions brought against the
''tormentor'' tabloids -- the Sun, Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, and Daily
Express -- following publication of a series of ''outrageous'' contempts
which put their chances of receiving a fair trial in jeopardy.
They accused Attorney-General Sir Nicholas Lyell of acting unlawfully
and irrationally in deciding that actions for contempt were unlikely to
succeed.
The sisters, of Forest Hill, south-east London, were sentenced to life
imprisonment in July, 1992, for the murder of bank clerk Mrs Alison
Shaughnessy, the new bride of Michelle's former lover.
A year later, the Court of Appeal quashed their convictions because
prejudicial publicity and material irregularities at the trial made the
verdicts unsafe and unsatisfactory. The court asked the Attorney-General
to consider bringing contempt proceedings against the newspapers
involved.
No action was taken and last December Michelle, 25, and Lisa, 22, were
granted leave for a judicial review of a decision by Solicitor-General
Sir Derek Spencer, acting on behalf of the Attorney-General, who said it
would not be appropriate to bring contempt proceedings.
The Taylor sisters were refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords
but are planning to appeal directly.
Solicitor Mark Stephens said the case was one of great constitutional
importance.
''That has been demonstrated with the certification of a point of
public importance.''
He added: ''There were known difficulties we were going to face here
with an Attorney-General who from the dim distant past has remained
unaccountable for his actions if he gets the law wrong or is
procedurally unfair. I think that is something which in a modern society
is unacceptable.''
The sisters, who were both legally aided, said they felt ''quite
chuffed'' with the ruling.
Said Lisa Taylor: ''We mustn't lose sight of the fact that we've
achieved quite a lot already. We've paved the way for someone else and
now we are going to the Lords.
''Although we may not have won today, we've made it known that the
press can't get away with it.''
Michelle Taylor added: ''We knew it was going to be difficult so we'll
just have to keep fighting.''
Lord Justice Stuart Smith, rejecting the argument that he could be
challenged in exactly the same way as were other prosecuting
authorities, said the Attorney-General was in a unique constitutional
position.
If Parliament had intended his discretion to be reviewable ''it would
have said so'', said the judge.

THE sun shone on Caledonian MacBrayne's new #16m ferry, Isle of Lewis,
and all who sailed on her yesterday for the vessel's first scheduled
crossing of the Minch between Stornoway and Ullapool.
It is hoped the 2200-tonne ship, built by Ferguson Shipbuilders of
Port Glasgow, will increase trade and tourism in the Western Isles.
With a top speed of 18 knots, the Isle of Lewis is expected to cut the
journey time between Stornoway and Ullapool by one hour. It can carry
968 passengers and 123 cars -- double the capacity of its predecessor,
Suilven.
CalMac said the new ferry, the largest vessel on the Western Isles
route, was designed to comply with the latest safety requirements.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said last week
during a tour of the new vessel that what happened to the Herald of Free
Enterprise could not happen to the Isle of Lewis because it had a
different type of bow visor and a sealed ramp.
Mr Colin Paterson, the ferry operator's managing director, said
yesterday: ''The Isle of Lewis will be a great boost to tourism in the
Western Isles and, more importantly, provide a faster luxury service for
those who live on the islands.''

New Delhi,
THE gruesome crime dubbed the ''Tandoori murder'' is gripping all
India, and newspapers are having a heyday with its potent mix of
politics and crime.
The case took centre-stage in Parliament today -- the first day of the
four-week monsoon session, with opposition parties accusing the ruling
Congress Party of harbouring criminals.
On the night of July 2, the body of Sushil Sharma's dismembered wife,
Naina Sahni, was discovered propped up inside a flaming tandoori oven in
a New Delhi restaurant.
The grisly nature of the crime, which Sharma says he did not commit,
was enough to grab headlines. However, Sharma's political stature -- as
former chief of Delhi's Youth Congress, he was a rising cadre in the
nation's ruling party -- and his own efforts to implicate political
rivals in the crime have turned the incident into a cause celebre.
The police claim that Sharma returned to his flat on July 2 and,
checking to see if his wife had been in contact with her alleged lover,
pushed a button on the phone which automatically redialled the last
number.
When he discovered that the last call had been to the man's home, he
allegedly went into a rage, shooting Sahni twice with his Armenius .32
calibre revolver.
The police charge sheet says that, after wrapping the body in a
plastic table cloth and bedsheet, Sharma went to Bagiya restaurant and
with the help of a worker, stuffed the corpse into the tandoori oven.
When he was arrested 10 days later in southern India, his head shaved,
Sharma said he had left Delhi on a pilgrimage. He is in custody, but no
trial date has been set.
With the Congress Party having proved vulnerable in several recent
state elections to charges of rampant corruption, leaders of the main
opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) agreed yesterday to demand
discussion of the case in parliament.
Today, to cries of ''tandoor, tandoor'', both parties of parliament
reconvened, with opposition parties claiming the case reflected criminal
elements within the party that has ruled India for all but three years
since independence.
Opposition members, demanding immediate discussion of the case, forced
a brief adjournment of the upper house, or Rajya Sabha.
''You should hang your heads in shame,'' the leader of the upper house
opposition, Sikandar Bakht, said to Congress members. Opposition members
shouted: ''Tandoor! Tandoor!''
Junior Home Minister P M Sayeed drew howls when he told Rajya Sabha
that charges in the case were before the courts and should not be
discussed. The Speaker then adjourned the stormy chamber.
''Congress is in the dock and the central government is answerable to
parliament,'' opposition leader Atal Behari Vajpayee told the lower
house, or Lok Sabha. ''We want to discuss the issue and censure the
government.''
Speaker Shivraj Patil asked the government to prepare a report within
two or three days on the law and order situation, and said the Tandoori
Murder case could be brought up in the context of the report.
Meanwhile, Sunday magazine has drawn comparisons between the Tandoori
Murder and the O J Simpson case.
Both accused were known to be jealous. Both allegedly abused their
wives. Both left the cities where the crimes were committed shortly
after the victims were killed. And both have lawyers who claim their
clients were framed by police.
However it pointed out one crucial difference. ''As the trial has gone
on, it has become clear that many Americans want O J Simpson to be
acquitted,'' it said. ''In India, however, the clamour is to hang Sushil
Sharma.'' -- Reuter.

Auckland
A NEW Zealand man today admitted to being the country's worst serial
rapist, with 129 charges against him including 46 rapes.
A district court was told that the hunt for the man known as the South
Auckland rapist ended on July 15 when Joseph Stephenson Thompson, 36,
opened his front door to police officers and said: ''I've been waiting
for you guys.''
Seventy-one of the 129 charges Thompson faces were sex-related. He
attacked 50 female victims aged between 10 and 43. Thirty-two of them
were aged 17 or under.
The search for the serial rapist cost #2m and tied up hundreds of
police officers in thousands of interviews. Thompson had been under
surveillance as a suspect and was later linked by DNA to some of the
victims.
Prosecutors said that Thompson, a factory cleaner, prowled
neighbourhoods on foot and felt the urge to rape when he heard voices
inside the homes of his victims.
Thompson himself had been sexually abused from an early age. He told
police he attacked to feed his sexual appetite, saying that when one got
hungry ''you go into the kitchen for a feed''.
Thompson has been remanded in custody for a psychiatric report and is
to be sentenced on Friday.--Reuter.

Zenica, Bosnia,
THE last two refugee families crammed into a UN minibus with their
bags full of possessions, left the camp, and passed through the guarded
gate of their temporary home for the last time.
Thousands of Bosnians from the war-weary area around Zepa fled to
Zenica after the fall of their former ''safe haven''.
Hundreds of them were forced to live in tents in a barbed-wire
enclosure near Zenica. The rows of white tents, along with makeshift
wooden toilet cubicles and an open communal area, are lined up past one
of Europe's biggest steel works -- now operating at a minimal level --
alongside the gentle river Bosna.
The refugees began arriving in large numbers last week. Around 5000
fled from Zepa after Serbian troops moved in. Most headed for Zenica and
its surrounding villages.
Now, however, the first wave of refugees have been moved into local
houses, schools, and empty buildings.
Yesterday, Turkish soldiers from the adjoining UN barracks worked
quickly to air the family tents, remove the narrow mattresses, and clear
up the scatter of empty food parcels to make the camp ready for the next
batch of war refugees.
Mesud, 14, was one of the first to flee his home and among the last to
leave the camp in the minibus.
He recalled having a gun was held to his neck and hiding with his
mother before finally fleeing his home. Young women frightened of being
raped by Serbian soldiers hid behind shawls and blackened their faces to
look older, he said.
Mesud said the camp had not been uncomfortable but he was glad to be
moving to a better home.
''This is not my real home. I wish I was there but we could not stay
there because of the soldiers. It is good we are moving into a house in
the city,'' he said.
His exhausted family added that they had no regrets about leaving the
conflict or the camp behind them: those who take their place could be
friends and family.
Up to 3000 people are still in hiding in the hills around Zepa. Half
are thought to be fighting men and the remaining 1500 their families,
refusing to move until their loved ones agree to leave or they can
return home.
A spokesman for the UN said negotiations were taking place to agree a
surrender or other peaceful settlement.
However the Bosnian fighters are unlikely to be allowed back into Zepa
town. It is more likely that they will be forced to make the 100-mile
journey to Zenica.
The central Bosnian city has escaped any serious outbreaks of
violence, though Muslims and Croats clashed in the surrounding areas
during 1993. At the height of the fighting it was reported that masked
Croats were killing Muslims house by house. A year before that an influx
of 35,000 Muslim refugees descended on Vitez, now home to the British
Army base.
The blackened and gutted houses common to local towns may serve as a
reminder of past brutalities but today the bleak city of Zenica,
surrounded by high mountains, is seen as a genuine safe haven by locals
and refugees alike. The rare and sporadic sound of gunfire and shelling
is attributed to drunken soldiers in the hills rather than serious
confrontations.
Mesud said: ''There is no fighting here and that is good. There have
been problems in my home town for a long time.''
Jasmin, a Muslim father of two who is married to a Croat, insists the
city is as safe as any in Bosnia. The war may drag on for three or four
years yet, he says, but Bosnia will recover.
Asked whether his daughters are Muslims or Croats, he says: ''They are
neither and both, they are Bosnians.''
Meanwhile, Serb refugees continue to seek sanctuary from the
intensified conflict around the Bihac area. Croat forces have captured
key Serb-held towns on the Bosnia-Croatia border where 25,000 Croat
soldiers are currently gathered. Last night, it was reported that peace
talks had broken down and there had been artillery exchanges in Krajina
Serb territory.

Dallas
MARK THATCHER has paid an undisclosed sum to settle a civil
racketeering suit involving a past business venture, his lawyer said
today.
Grantham Co, which Thatcher partly owns, had provided management
consulting services to Ameristar Fuels Corporation, in which Thatcher's
business partner David Wallace was an investor. Thatcher lives in
Dallas.
Both men were accused by Ameristar founder John Laughlin of trying to
oust him from the company.
The legal suit was filed in January last year, and Thatcher was
included in the action last February.
Thatcher's lawyer Skip Marter said the private settlement was
finalised last week.
''He made a business decision,'' said Marter. ''Given the costs to
litigate, and given the amount of publicity already developing, it made
economic sense for him to reach an agreement. He feels he's been
successful in doing that.''
He declined comment on reports that the former Prime Minister's son
had agreed to pay a six-figure sum to settle.--Reuter.

Larnaca
A SCIENTIST told a Cypriot court today that DNA tests on blood-stained
clothing worn by three British soldiers showed the blood came from the
same person.
Riflemen Alan Ford, 26, Justin Fowler, 27, and Jeff Pernell, 23, are
charged with the the manslaughter of 23-year-old Danish tour guide
Louise Jensen. All three deny the charge.
Nira Gallili, a forensic biologist employed with Israeli police, told
the court she carried out tests on specimens sent to her by Cyprus
police in October and November last year.
Blood found on exhibits worn by the British soldiers all came from the
same person, she told the court.
She added that she could not positively identify it as Jensen's blood
because a sample from her body, taken two days after her death, was in
poor condition.
''It originated from a person with the same DNA profile, and did not
originate from the defendants or the boyfriend,'' said Gallili,
referring to Jensen's Cypriot boyfriend.
The defendants, all stationed at the British base of Dhekelia, are
charged with abducting Jensen, a tour guide, and beating her to death
with a spade.
When arrested they were wearing bloodstained clothes. Their lawyers
claimed this was the result of police beatings.--Reuter.

Paris, Monday
FRENCH newspapers and television published three police descriptions
today of Arab-looking men wanted for questioning after last week's Paris
Metro bombing.
France, meanwhile, continued to suffer from a wave of false alarms and
hoaxes in department stores, stations, and at the Louvre museum.
The three men were described as ''important witnesses'' to the
underground blast, which killed seven people and wounded 86.
Investigators believe Algeria's Muslim extremist groups were behind
last Tuesday's blast.
However civil liberties groups have warned against whipping up public
animosity towards the large Arab community in France by turning an
entire population group into suspects.
The left-wing daily Liberation declined to publish the pictures,
saying they were mere ''sketches for internal use''.
The right-wing popular daily France-Soir however called one of the
three figures the ''number one suspect''.
Justice Minister Jacques Toubon said publication of the pictures was
decided after careful reflection and should be used warily. ''These are
important witnesses and not, as some people would have it, suspects,''
he told reporters.
Toubon said research into the explosive used at Saint-Michel station
would probably yield results within 48 hours.
One portrait was compiled with the help of an off-duty policeman who
overheard some Arab-looking men at a west Paris station say an hour
before the blast: ''Things'll get hot in Saint-Michel tonight.''
Another witness saw a man make an obscene gesture towards the train
after it left the station before Saint-Michel.
Meanwhile a judge in the Italian town of Trieste ordered a man
believed to be Moroccan to be held on a terrorism charge after he was
stopped at the border carrying bomb-making instructions on a computer
disc.--Reuter.

ROME: The opening night of the opera Tosca ended with a bang at a
summer festival in eastern Italy when the hero was shot in the foot
during the execution scene. Italian tenor Fabio Armiliato, playing the
painter Mario Cavaradossi, sat on the stage rubbing his left foot and
was taken away on a stretcher, organisers said. He was treated in
hospital for cuts and bruises.
Festival staff said he may have been hit by flying debris from a blank
fired from a rifle in the third-act execution scene. The rest of the
open-air performance at Macerata was scrapped.

Dagan Hill, West Bank
POLICE and soldiers dragged hundreds of Israeli settlers off a
disputed West Bank hilltop today, driving home the message that they
will not be allowed to block the planned extension of Palestinian
self-rule.
For much of the day, evacuated settlers ran straight back up Dagan
Hill, which they declared a part of the nearby Efrat settlement last
week. Dozens of settlers were arrested and at least 25 people, including
one policeman, were slightly injured.
About 400 police and army troops began the evacuation of Dagan Hill
around midday, surrounding the roughly 600 settlers and carrying them
individually off the hill in the scorching sun.
By evening the hill was in army hands, but settlers promised further
similar protests elsewhere in the West Bank. Tonight settlers on a hill
outside the settlement Beit El put up several makeshift shacks.
Settler leaders said today's confrontation, one of their largest yet
with Israeli troops, proved their determination to oppose the expansion
of Palestinian autonomy and served as a warning against any future
attempt to dismantle settlements.
''If it happened here, in a place we just got, it must be understood
that if, God forbid, they try to take settlers out of their homes . . .
it will be worse,'' said Rabbi Shlomo Riskin.
Talks with the PLO on a withdrawal of Israeli troops from West Bank
towns are being held this week in the Red Sea resort of Eilat. The deal
would constitute the second stage of the autonomy framework outlined in
the September 1993 Israel-PLO accord.
The current deal is more complex than the Gaza-Jericho self-rule
established 14 months ago because of the 140,000 settlers in the West
Bank -- compared to only 5000 in Gaza -- as well as the area's strategic
value and spiritual significance for many Jews.
''This is a critical point. In Eilat right now, they are signing over
the rest of our land,'' said Efrat resident Earl Harrow, watching as his
wife was dragged off Dagan Hill.
Mossi Raz, an Israeli peace activist, argued the area did not belong
to Israel. ''It is occupied land and the Palestinian flag, not the
Israeli flag, belongs here,'' he said.
Dagan Hill lies between Efrat, 12 miles south of Jerusalem, and the
neighbouring Palestinian village of Al-Khader. It is claimed by
residents of both areas.
The Civil Administration, which runs the West Bank, issued an
evacuation order against the Al-Khader settlers last week.
PLO chief Yasser Arafat's spokesman praised the Israeli authorities'
move against the settlers.
''As partners in the peace agreement, they have to take care of
extremists on their side. It was a wise movement,'' said Marwan
Kanafani.
In Tel Aviv tonight, about 1000 people demonstrated at the site of
last Monday's bus bombing that killed six Israelis. Television reports
said protesters attacked a TV crew, scuffled with police, and threw
gravel at guards. Several were arrested.
Meanwhile, an Israeli court today issued an arrest warrant against
Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, the first legal step towards submitting
a request for his extradition from the United States.
The charges against Abu Marzuk, a political leader of the Islamic
Resistance Movement Hamas, included conspiracy to murder, to
manslaughter, and to causing injury or grievous bodily harm.
The US Government arrested Abu Marzuk last week after it found his
name on the so-called ''Watch List'' of aliens not allowed to enter the
United States.
Hamas leads violent opposition to the Israel-PLO peace deal. Its
militants have killed scores of Israelis in suicide attacks since the
1993 accord, such as last week's bus blast.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israel's decision to pursue the
extradition sent a message to groups like Hamas that Israel was not
afraid to fight terrorism ''without mercy or hesitation''.--AP/Reuter.

IT is perhaps the most horrifying and heart-rending of all crimes. The
killing of a child, the tearing away from a family of its most precious
gift, leaves a wound which never really heals.
As well as the personal tragedy for the family involved, such an
attack on youth and innocence leaves a deep impression on the national
consciousness.
The weekend deaths of Sophia Hook, Paul Barker, and Robert Gee, out
and about enjoying their school holidays, add to the long list of tragic
child killings.
The names of the victims are indelibly imprinted on the public memory:
two-year-old James Bulger, battered to death by two 11-year-olds on
Merseyside; Nicola Conroy, 12, stabbed to death in front of her
classmates at her Middlesbrough school; Hartlepool three-year-old Rosie
Palmer, whose murderer was jailed for life last week.
The killers' motives are complex and varied but they come to share a
common notoriety: nurse Beverly Allitt, who killed four children she was
caring for at a Lincolnshire hospital; Robert Black, given 10 life
sentences for murdering three schoolgirls in the 1980s; and the most
notorious of all the child killers, the Moors murderers Myra Hindley and
Ian Brady.
Whatever the circumstances, the impact on the family is invariably
devastating.
Parents tend to turn first to family and friends for support but later
many feel the need to talk with people who have endured similar
experiences.
Ms Denise Watson, spokeswoman for the Bristol-based self-help group
Compassionate Friends, which helps bereaved parents come to terms with
the loss of children from murder as well as suicide, accident, and
disease, explained some of the particular pressures suffered by the
parents of murdered children.
''It's a brutally sudden way to lose a child. You're totally numb in
the early weeks after it happens but you still have to get on with
things like arranging a funeral.
''At the same time, there is also the sensationalist aspect of the
death. You have the intrusion to cope with, the interest of the press
and television, and then the very public inquest.''
The search for the culprit poses particular problems. ''The parents
face a very long ordeal. There's the question of bringing the
perpetrator of the crime to justice and it's a dreadful period before
the offender is apprehended.
''Even when the police do apprehend the murderer, the parents face a
prolonged wait, perhaps 12 months, for the case to come to trial. The
pressure is unimaginable.''
Ms Watson said it was important for bereaved parents to speak
eventually to organisations like Compassionate Friends, which has a pool
of around 240 volunteers, all bereaved parents, and is in touch with
around 2000 parents.
''There's nothing like being able to say, 'I know how you feel' and
for them to know that's true. It helps them to see further along the
road, to think that maybe they can get through it. You never get over
it, there will always be scar tissue, but you have to learn to live with
it.''
Most parents eventually learn to rid themselves of the desire for
vengeance. ''You live a maimed kind of existence if you let your life be
governed by that. But they do tend to feel that such an offender should
be kept very securely, simply so other parents don't have to go what
they have gone through,'' said Ms Watson.
However disturbing an individual killing may be, the statistics
indicate that the killing of children is not a growing problem.
The statistics remained roughly stable between 1983 and 1993, with an
average of 86.4 child homicides a year.
The figures cover the murders and manslaughters of boys and girls
under 16, as well as infanticides, in England and Wales.
The highest total during that 10-year period, 102, was recorded in
1985, with a ''low'' of 60 coming the following year, 1986.
In 1993 -- the last year for which the Home Office has complete
figures -- the total was 73, one less than the total of 74 recorded 10
years earlier.

THOUSANDS of pensioners may lose out on concessionary fares because of
boundary changes for the new Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority.
Those in rural areas of Ayrshire and Lanarkshire would be worst
affected as both subsidies and cheap fares would be under threat.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley and
chairman of the all-party pensioners group, has demanded an urgent
meeting with Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
He said: ''I fear that the plans as they stand will result in massive
unfairness to pensioners and disabled people.''
His call has the backing of Strathclyde Elderly Forum which expressed
its disappointment that following a meeting with the Scottish Office the
proposals went ahead without significant alteration.
The forum's Linda Martin said: ''There is no doubt that elderly people
will suffer if, as we fear, subsidies do not continue in certain rural
areas and the concessionary fares scheme comes to an end.
''We met with Lord James Douglas-Hamilton to seek a change of heart
but the boundaries of the new authority appear to be going ahead as
planned.''

A DOZEN bouquets held in place by stones from the pebble beach last
night marked the spot where Sophie Hook's body was found.
The cards with the flowers portrayed the shock and condolences of a
holiday community better known for its old-style amusement arcades, bed
and breakfast accommodation, and sweeping seafront promenade.
Perched among the flowers was a doll and a small rabbit -- one card
read: ''Sleep little angel, you are in heaven above.''
Holidaymakers carried on enjoying the blazing sunshine as best they
could and the nearby large paddling pool -- now reopened by police --
was thronged with children.
The bouquets seemed to pass almost unnoticed by most as parents kept a
closer-than-usual eye on their children, not letting them stray out of
sight.
Mrs Eileen Philips, from Telford, Shropshire, on holiday with her two
children, said she had heard about the horrific murder and was nervous
about making sure they did not leave her sight for a moment.
''You think it could be your children -- it's a terrible thing. Both
my two are now under orders not to stray at all but I haven't really
explained why -- it would be too frightening for them.''
Police continued house-to-house inquiries in the village in the shadow
of the Little Ormes Head just outside Llandudno. Other officers
patrolled the beach area, now busy with sunseekers, checking with
anybody who may have seen anything suspicious.
The pathway at the back of Sophie Hook's uncle's house, from which she
was snatched, remained sealed off.
Meanwhile, the woods around Eastham Rake, in Wirral, were silent
yesterday but for the noise of police carrying out a fingertip search of
the area where two boys on a fishing trip were brutally murdered.
The normal happy sounds of children running and playing in the long
grass and dense vegetation was stilled as the reality of the deaths sank
in.
Just three days ago, it had been a startlingly different picture.
Robbie Gee, 12, and his best friend Paul Barker, 13, had been among the
scores of children who used the area as a summer playground.
Yesterday, as the sun scorched down, police carried out an intense

''It is like something out of a horror film,'' said one.
0 The two boys had cycled to a pond known locally as ''the Carpies''

fishing tackle and bikes were found there by officers searching the
scene.
Eastham is a quiet, middle-class village, once known for its ferry
which long ago plied across the Mersey from Liverpool. In the 1930s, the
once picturesque village, with its ancient yew in the parish churchyard,
was developed as a dormitory suburb for Liverpool ''over the water''.

ONE of the new single-tier authorities criticised in a ''jobs for the
boys'' row has attacked the Staff Commission from which it received
advice on the appointment of a senior official.
Mr Michael Watters, chief executive of Dumbarton and Clydebank
Council, said the commission's behaviour regarding the appointment of a
depute chief executive raised ''serious questions about its competence''
to give advice on the complex issue of transferring thousands of local
government employees to the new councils next spring.
After appointing a depute chief executive, Mr Ian Leitch, from the
same field of applicants interviewed for the post of chief executive,
Dumbarton and Clydebank Council found its procedures being investigated
despite having taken advice from the commission in May on procedures.
Initially, the commission did not object to what the council was
proposing -- appoint a depute chief executive from applicants for the
post of chief executive. However, in a recent letter to council, the
commission, ''on further reflection'', recognised there could well be
potential candidates for a depute post who would not have wanted to
compete for the chief executive's post.
The commission said it would not be pursuing the Dumbarton and
Clydebank case but it has told the council that, in similar
circumstances, it would advise that a depute post be advertised in the
normal way.
Mr Watters has now written to the commission demanding an explanation.
He said: ''The commission can't have it both ways. Either they stand by
the advice they give councils or they lose credibility. It is totally
unacceptable for them to give the go-ahead for an appointment and then
criticise the appointment in public as if it had nothing to do with
them.''
In a revised set of guidelines issued yesterday, the commission says
candidates for a particular post should not be considered for any other
post on the basis that they were ''good runners-up''. All posts should
be seen as entirely separate and the full appointment procedure applied
in each case.
A commission spokesman said last night: ''The commission has already
accepted that Dumbarton and Clydebank Council acted appropriately on the
advice received. We came out with our hands up on that so I don't know
why he's so cross.''

<HEADLINE>Scots are measuring up for big metric muddle</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977109096</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
WITH exactly two months today to go before all prepacked goods such as
food and washing powder are by law to be marketed in kilogrammes, Scots
seem to be heading for a metric shopping muddle.
Kilogrammes will rule from October 1, although it will still be legal
to print the Imperial equivalent alongside on the packet. Which is just
as well, because Scottish trading standards officers are worried by
evidence of public ignorance and an ever-widening metric generation gap.
Despite years of buying petrol metrically, for example, a high
proportion of adults over 30 are hazy about how litres compare with
gallons. And the younger generation brought up at school with hectares
and grammes are equally vague on acres and ounces.
Mr Bruce Collier, director of consumer protection for the new unitary
South Ayrshire Council and national spokesman for the Institute of
Trading Standards, says: ''There is no national plan in sight from the
Metrication Board, and we urgently need an initiative to produce
literature to inform people.
''Public education has a long way to go. We will, after all, have gone
totally metric by the start of the next century, which is only
four-and-a-half years away.''
Fears about the dire level of metric confusion are backed by the
findings of a survey conducted by Borders tradings standards officers
who were worried by the apparent lack of Government urgency in getting
the message across.
A questionnaire answered by 200 consumers, a quarter of whom were
under 25, revealed that:
* Only half knew the gallon equivalent of filling a car with 45 litres
of petrol (10 gallons).
* Only 107 knew that a half-litre carton of milk contained less than a
pint.
* Out of the 200, 92 did not know that eight ounces of cheese weighs
more than 200 grammes (it is 227 grammes).
* Only around half knew that a carpet costing #15 per square metre is
better value than another at #15 a square yard.
* An overwhelming majority of 122 did not know how much they weighed
in stones if their doctor told them they tipped the scales at 70
kilogrammes (11 stone).
In all, only one person answering the questionnaire said they were
''very comfortable'' converting Imperial to metric. Of the rest, 52
described themselves are ''comfortable'', 114 were ''not very
comfortable'' and 24 said they were completely lost.
The survey was distributed equally among men and women.
Borders trading standards officer Mr Ian Clarkson said: ''The findings
confirmed our fears about the general level of ignorance. At the petrol
pumps it seems that most people are now buying in units of price -- say
#10 worth -- rather ran by quantity.
''It is a big change in habits when you remember how motorists used to
queue up to take advantage of a few pennies off a gallon.''
There is one consolation, however, for those who cannot tear
themselves away from thinking Imperially. Even after January 1, 2000,
you will still be able to buy a pint of beer and run (depending how many
kilogrammes you weigh) a mile.

Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East, wrote to Sir Basil Feldman,

mysteriously 'disappeared' thereafter, along with the sad resurgence of
nationalism and xenophobia in our great party.''
He said restoring the flag to the platform would highlight the party's

fervent wish for us to be 'at the heart of Europe'.''

WHO is Michael Forsyth going to call now? ''Bumf-busters''!
In fact, the new Scottish Secretary, who recently hired two political
advisers, has already made demands on his ministerial team to eliminate
the mounds of paperwork and the red tape which have become part and
parcel of Government life.
Announcing a ''bumf-busters' initiative'' yesterday, Mr Forsyth said
on his first day in office last month he had determined to get rid of as
much bureaucracy as he could.
His aim was to allow people at the sharp end of service to the public
to be able to get on with key tasks rather than wasting time on
unnecessary form-filling.
''I'd rather have surgical tape being used than red tape,'' said Mr
Forsyth, whose ministers have begun assessing, through consultation with
doctors, teachers, farmers, and police, how much paper can be blitzed
and will report back in six months.
''Each minister has been asked to look at their area of
responsibilities, identify the current load of paperwork, and in
consultation with people at the receiving end, report on what is
avoidable, and what can be simplified and made more user-friendly.
''The potential is there for a sizeable bonfire of official paper at
the end of six months.''
Mr Forsyth said, in the business sector, at least 653 forms were
issued to businesses and the general public, and some of them went to
20,000 people to ask for responses.
In health, there was potential for reductions of around 90% in the
number of paper claims from general practitioners to health boards.
In the criminal justice system, there were moves that would reduce the
flow of paper between organisations and free police officers and other
staff in courts and the prosecution service to concentrate on preventing
and combatting crime.
Savings of #3m were anticipated through cutting down on police
paperwork providing considerable benefits for those who came into
contact with the criminal justice system -- including crime victims.
Mr Forsyth said that, in education, he was taking further steps to
minimise the volume of written material issued to schools.
''I regard the tackling of unnecessary bureacracy into the lives of
the people of Scotland as a high priority, so that providers of services
and skills can be relieved of frustrating paperwork and be able to
concentrate on what they do best.''

<HEADLINE>Prescott warns summer campaign will turn heat on the Government. 'Chicken run' Tories face Labour taunts</HEADLINE>

LABOUR announced yesterday it was mounting ''Operation Chicken Run''
designed to monitor the number of Conservative MPs leaving their current
seats in search of safer constituencies.
Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson said: ''The Government says
the feel-good factor will win them the next election. But Tory MPs don't
feel good. They feel scared. That's why they are chickening out and
running for safer seats.''
One of the leaders in the rush, he claimed, was the Conservative Party
chairman himself, Dr Brian Mawhinney, whose Peterborough seat becomes
more marginal as a result of changes implemented by the Parliamentary
Boundary Commission.
Mr John Prescott, Labour deputy leader, said: ''If the chairman of the
Tory party intends to desert his constituents, what sort of message is
that to the rest of the party and to the country.''
They were speaking at the launch of Labour's ''summer heat on the
Tories'' campaign which will involve 150 events around the country
during the summer months when Parliament is in recess.
Mr Prescott said: ''We will make sure this is a long, hot summer for
the Tories. We will be telling people that there is now a straighforward
choice for Britain; no change with John Major or a new beginning with
Labour.''
Labour plans to cover every political issue. Shadow Northern Ireland
Secretary Marjory Mowlam, said they planned to seize the radical centre
with contemporary solutions to contemporary problems but also giving
people security.
The Conservatives, she said, were providing neither. ''John Major is
like a rabbit staring into the headlights of the approaching juggernaut
of change, too stubborn to move and too uncomprehending to understand
what is going to hit him.''
The summer campaign would give Labour the opportunity to get across
policies which had been swamped by the Conservative leadership contest.
Mr Prescott said they would exploit ''the Tories' continuing spiral of
decline''.
Dr Mawhinney said he still had to decide which part of his
Peterborough constituency, split into two unequal parts by the Boundary
Commission, he would seek to represent.
His majority at the General Election was 5376 over Labour and the
changes would make the constituency of the same name, which will hold
about two thirds of his current constituents, even more marginal.
He is thought likely to opt for the new North West Cambridgeshire
seat, holding less than one third of his present constituents but a much
safer proposition. When he makes his decision, he can be sure Labour
will give it maximum publicity.
He will not want to follow the party chairman at the last General
Election, Mr Chris Patten, who tried to combine that job with fighting
his highly marginal seat of Bath, which he lost.
Dr Mawhinney said the boundary changes had left him no option but to
choose between the divided parts of his present seat. Other Tory MPs
have taken the same line.
Mr David Amess, whose Basildon constituency was famous at the last
election as the first Tory marginal not to swing to Labour, said the
changes meant that the seat would be completely different except in
name. Around 20,000 voters have been added who are expected to provide a
Labour majority and Mr Amess will move to another Essex seat.
Dr Mawhinney pointed out that it was not only Conservative MPs who
were affected by boundary changes and who had to decide which part of
their former constituency to try to continue representing.
Also, he claimed that Labour, by forcing 32 constituency parties to
choose a woman candidate, undermined the legitimacy of the candidates
chosen and showed contempt for the electorate. He challenged them to
reselect now in these seats.

THE Rank Organisation yesterday announced plans to develop a #20m
leisure and entertainment park, creating 500 jobs, beside the River
Clyde in Glasgow.
The park would include a 12-screen Odeon multiplex cinema, a Mecca
bingo club, and four restaurants. If planning permission is granted for
the development of the Springfield Quay site, the facilities could be
open by the end of next year.
The site, almost 17 acres situated just west of the Kingston Bridge on
the south side of the river, was used for warehousing in the city's
shipping heyday. In 1988, it became a car park for the Glasgow Garden
Festival.
The site was subsequently used by the Royal Mail for a sorting centre
and vehicle workshop but it decided to dispose of these premises when it
moved to a new and larger facility in Springburn. The buildings have
remained vacant since 1993 and the site is now derelict.
A spokeswoman for the Rank Organisation said the proposed development
would include landscaping to the waterfront, with enhancement of the
riverside walkway and the creation of outdoor seating areas and piazzas.
There would also be improved access to the site direct from Paisley
Road, including traffic control measures and secure car parking for more
than 1000 vehicles.
One of the four restaurants would be a ''drive-through'' facility and
the other three, all on the waterfront, would be family orientated.
A spokesman for Glasgow District Council yesterday confirmed that it
had received Rank's planning application for the development and said it
would be considered in due course. It is understood it could take at
least two months before a decision is reached.
Rank has opened a public exhibition unit, including a scale model and
artist's impressions, for anyone who is interested in finding out more
about the plans. The unit is located opposite Springfield Quay, in Harry
Ramsden's car park, and is open every day from 12 noon to 8pm until
Sunday, 13 August.
Meanwhile, in an unusual scheme near Cambuslang, a developer is
building houses on greenbelt land but at the same time returning an
adjacent old steelworks site to green glory. The public-private sector
partnership is expected to create up to 30 jobs and housing for 3000
people.
The Banks Property Group has been granted planning permission to
develop the site of the former Hallside steelworks, which has lain
derelict for 15 years, in partnership with the Strathclyde Greenbelt
Company.

A CHRISTIAN charity worker
is awaiting sentence today for the rape of a 22-year-old student.
William Stevenson, 28, tied up and raped the woman in her Eastbourne
bedsit after tricking her into trusting him by quoting passages from the
bible. Lewes Crown Court in Sussex heard how the convent-educated woman
begged 17-stone Stevenson not to kill her during the two-hour ordeal.
Stevenson, who lives and works at a Christian drop-in centre in
Glasgow's Possilpark, had denied rape and another serious sexual offence
but was convicted by a jury yesterday. He was acquitted of a third
charge of stealing #24 from the woman.
Judge Alastair Troup adjourned sentencing until today.
The court heard Stevenson had followed the woman to Eastbourne after
she reluctantly befriended him at Victoria Coach Station in London.
He claimed he lost his money and could not afford to stay on in the
capital.
She had travelled up from Eastbourne to catch a coach from London to
Devon to visit her mother.
When she missed her coach she headed back to Eastbourne intending to
make the journey the next day but Stevenson followed her. He convinced a
British Rail guard to let him travel on her train without a ticket
because he had no money.
Stevenson persuaded the woman to let him sleep on her floor by sobbing
and telling her he would have to sleep on a park bench. The next morning
he woke her at 7am, tied her arms behind her back with her own pyjamas,
and raped her.
She finally managed to escape and ran naked and screaming into the
street.
Several neighbours stood guard at her door to stop Stevenson leaving
before police arrived.
Stevenson claimed the woman had invited him into her bed and he was
''freaked out'' when she ran yelling for help into the road.

A TOUCH of Glasgow bravado gave homeless William McKell a small slice
of Scotland's largest lottery payout yesterday.
When he spotted #3.7m winner Bob Westland posing for press
photographers in Buchanan Street, he dived in and asked if he wanted to
buy a copy of the Big Issue.
The bemused postmaster handed over #10 for a copy of the paper about
the homeless. It normally sells at 70p.
Mr Westland, 57, spent the morning handing out pensions at his small
sub post office in Plean, Stirlingshire, before heading for Glasgow with
his wife Anne and four sons to receive his cheque from Camelot. He
simply couldn't get anyone to stand in for him in the post office at
such short notice.
He said he had been a bag of nerves since realising that he had picked
the six winning numbers. ''The biggest problem was keeping the ticket
safe from Saturday until Monday morning. It was a major worry.''
His wife Anne, a teacher, said: ''Last night, I locked all the windows
and I never usually do that.''
News of the win had spread so quickly that they had no option but to
go public on it.
Mr Westland didn't use the traditional line that the money won't
change him. He plans to sell his sub post office. The family has no
clear plans on what to do with the money yet but Mrs Westland suggested
''a house in the sun''.

AN investigation was under way yesterday into the first North Sea oil
or gas diving death for 11 years.
Mr Bradley Westell died during cable laying work from the diving
support vessel Stena Orelia on Shell's Barque extension project.
A spokesman for his employers, Coflexip Stena Offshore, said Mr
Westell became detached from his life-support umbilical near the Clipper
complex, 60 miles off Norfolk, shortly after midnight yesterday.
An immediate rescue attempt involving the stand-by diver was made but
Mr Westell could not be located. The fast rescue craft from the Stena
Orelia was launched and his body was found on the surface.
Mr Westell lived in Portlethen, near Aberdeen, with his partner, Ms
Pauline Matthews, and her five-year-old daughter, Jennifer. It is
understood they hoped to marry soon.
Two inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive flew to the scene
yesterday to investigate the incident.
A spokesman for Stena said this was the first diving death in the
history of the company.
''We take this matter very seriously and thorough investigations will
be held by the Health and Safety Executive, police, our client, and
ourselves to discover the exact cause of the incident and what steps, if
any, can be taken to avoid a recurrence of this accident,'' said Mr
Steve Roberts, offshore resources manager.
After numerous diving deaths in the North Sea oil and gas industry
during the early days of oil production in the 1970s, the safety record
dramatically improved.
A Health and Safety Executive spokesman said their records showed
three deaths prior to 1973. The subsequent totals were 1973 -- one, 1974
-- three, 1975 -- three, 1976 -- six, 1977 -- two, 1978 -- two, 1979 --
three, and 1984 -- one.

A MAN who saw three friends die as he clung to a plastic drum in icy
seas for more than 17 hours relived his ordeal yesterday.
Mr Jim Miller, 44, set out with the group on Saturday morning on a
boat trip across the Tay Estuary, from Newburgh to Arbroath.
Mr Miller, Mr Gerald Bruce, 58, his son Ian, 26, and Mr Alan Jones,
50, all from Arbroath, ran into difficulties three hours later when
their 25ft cruiser hit a sandbank off Barry Buddon.
Mr Miller recalled: ''A wave came up, lifted the boat, and dropped it
down again. The engine room was flooded. The water was just pouring in.
''There were two pumps -- a hand pump and an electric pump. They were
working but not taking the water out.''
The men could see the shore and decided to make for land across the
sandbank.
''There were three plastic drums and a life-ring,'' said Mr Miller.
''We took them and we jumped into the water but it was only up to our
knees and thighs. We just headed for the shore.
''Then the fog came in and that was how we lost our direction. We were
heading towards the sound of the waves breaking but when we got there it
was just another sandbank.
''The waves had come in at different directions so we couldn't follow
the waves in to the shore.
''Gerry was in the ring and we all had the drums. We took our belts
off and put them around the handles and had them strapped over and we
were pushing Gerry.''
Mr Miller, of Linton Road, then endured the awful spectacle of first
watching Mr Bruce die and then his son a few hours later.
''When Gerry died, we took him out of the ring. We put his son in the
ring and we kept going, then Ian died,'' he said.
When dragging their two friends towards shore became too much, Mr
Miller and Mr Jones tied father and son to one other by the hands -- so
that they would be found together.
''Allan and I kept going,'' said Mr Miller. ''Then Allan just grabbed
his chest and turned over. I grabbed him but he was dead too. That was
about an hour before the lifeboat arrived.
''I lost him and I just kept going myself.
''None of them drowned. Gerry had trouble with his heart. There was
nothing anybody could do.''
The bodies of Mr Bruce and his son were recovered on Sunday and Mr
Jones's body recovered yesterday after a coastline search by police and
coastguards.
Mr Miller admitted last night that he was amazed by his own escape.
''I don't know how I managed to survive,'' he said. ''The doctor says
its because of my fat. That was one of the major factors.
''It was at the back of my mind that I would survive. But actually,
just before the lifeboat came, I was wanting to go to sleep.
''Then I heard somebody shouting. I turned round and the lifeboat was
there.
''It has still not hit me yet. I don't believe it has happened. I'm
devastated for my friends.
''Gerry just bought the boat for himself, just to go out for a sail or
out fishing. It wasn't a commercial boat.
''There was a lot to be done on it. It was being vandalised in
Newburgh, so he was bringing it down to sort it in Arbroath.''
After his rescue, coastguards criticised the lack of safety equipment
on board the vessel.
Mr Miller's survival suit, which he uses on inshore fishing trips, was
left at home and the boat had no flares or lifejackets.
Mr Miller commented: ''They would be right enough. The boat was more
or less being sorted at the time and it was just the shell with an
engine inside.
''With that kind of weather, we were not expecting anything like this
to happen. I didn't know what was on the boat because I was not
expecting to go on the trip. I only went at the last minute.''
Now the unemployed builder has vowed never to return to sea. He is
still recovering at home with his wife, Liz, 41, and four children,
Kevin, 18, Louise, 17, Madge, 14, and 11-year-old Catherine.
Mrs Miller said last night: ''He'll never get on a boat again. I'm
just relieved but I feel upset for the other families.''
Mr Jones, of Largo Street, had three children and was separated from
his wife, Joyce. His son, Lee, 22, said yesterday: ''The family are
distraught.''
The family of Gerald and Ian Bruce were too upset to speak at their
home in Arbroath's Princes Street.

WILLIAM Wallace will return to Stirling Bridge on September 3 when the
European premiere of Mel Gibson's film of his life, Braveheart, is to be
held in Stirling.
Gibson will attend, as will other stars of his epic film which ends,
Wallace dying, with the word ''Freedom'' on his lips. It features some
of the most lavish medieval battle scenes ever shot and opens throughout
Britain on September 8.
The film company's decision to opt for a Stirling premiere meant
Braveheart was not available for the Edinburgh Film Festival, which ends
on August 27.
It opened in the United States 10 weeks ago, has taken an exceptional
#40m to date, and also got excellent reviews. Whether Scotland's critics
agree is another matter and Wallace could get hung, drawn, and quartered
all over again.
As well as Gibson, sporting a commendable Scottish accent as Wallace,
the film stars Patrick McGoohan as Edward I, Sophie Marceau as the
Princess of Wales, with whom Wallace has an affair, newcomer Catherine
McCormack as his wife, Murron -- Marion Bradfute to us -- and Angus
McFadyen as Robert the Bruce.
Although some of the film was made in Scotland, the big battle scenes
were shot in Ireland, the film company having been attracted by the
better terms offered to film makers by the Irish Government as well as
by the availability of greater numbers of extras.
Written by Randall Wallace, Braveheart takes a typically Hollywood
view of Scottish history, which is to say it plays fast and loose, but
as a piece of epic cinema it is in the front rank.

FEWER couples in Scotland are marrying and even fewer are having
children, according to the annual report of the Registrar General.
Numbers of births in Scotland fell last year to 61,656, the lowest
since records became compulsory in 1855. Falling fertility rates also
raise the prospect of the country not being able to sustain itself.
''The rates indicate that, if current trends of birth and death rates
were maintained, the number of female births would not be adequate to
ensure that the population of Scotland reproduced itself,'' the report
said.
Numbers of marriages also fell to 31,480, the lowest figure since
1926. Divorces rose slightly to 13,133 and an increasing proportion
(13%) involved those who had been divorced before. A total of 10,000
dependent children were affected.
However, the recent trend of modest population growth continued in
1994, taking the total to 5.13 million. This was largely due to a 5000
drop in the number of deaths to 59,328.
The report also underlines the long-established health and social
divide between Glasgow and its more affluent suburbs. Eastwood has the
lowest standardised death rate (8.6%) in Scotland and Glasgow the
highest (13.6%). It also has the lowest birth rate to unmarried parents
(6.7%) in the country, whereas Glasgow has the highest (44%).

AN Ulster loyalist politician appeared in court yesterday on a
terrorist charge amid a massive security operation.
Mr Lindsay Robb, of the Progressive Unionist Party, who met Minister
Michael Ancram for talks in June, was charged with conspiring to procure
weapons for the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters.
Five other men were similarly charged. The six appeared at Falkirk
Sheriff Court after a high-speed dash from Maryhill police station.
A cavalcade of nine police cars, seven vans, and five motorbike
outriders took just 25 minutes to complete the 25-mile journey. Around
50 officers were involved in the transfer, most of them armed, including
the rapid response unit of Central Scotland Police.
Police marksmen were perched on the courthouse roof as the accused
arrived in six vans. Four officers, armed with machine-guns and
handguns, kept guard as the vans -- each carrying one prisoner and his
armed escorts -- reversed into the court premises.
Meanwhile, officers with alsatian dogs patrolled outside.
Earlier, police sniffer dogs had searched every room of the building,
the upper part of which was sealed off from the public two hours before
the 2pm hearing.
Outside, dozens of uniformed police cordoned off streets and diverted
traffic.
As the vans arrived, two men among a group of onlookers unfurled a
Union Jack. A woman PC quietly asked them to put it away and they did.
The six accused men were among nine detained more than a week ago at
Maryhill Police HQ, Glasgow, after an undercover anti-terrorist
operation in Falkirk, Airdrie, Lanarkshire, and Liverpool.
In court, each accused's case was heard individually in private.
Leading Scots criminal lawyer Joe Beltrami emerged to say that he
represented one accused -- Mr William McArthur, a Falkirk taxi driver.
Another of the accused is believed to be Mr David White, from Falkirk.
Mr Beltrami said the charges involved conspiracy relating to the
''conveying of firearms, ammunition, and explosives'' to Ulster.
He said the accused were scheduled to appear in Falkirk Sheriff Court
for full committal proceedings next Monday, when applications for bail
would be lodged.

<TEXT>
A MAN who raped a 20-year-old stranger after tying her up in a bizarre
sexual ritual was yesterday jailed for eight years.
Johnnie Burt, 31, attacked the woman as she took a short cut through
waste ground in Paisley last December. He pulled a chunk of hair from
her head, kicked her in the face, and stripped her.
Burt tied her clothing round her head and carried out sex acts. At one
point, he snapped a long, thin branch from a tree and assaulted the
helpless girl with it. He then raped her.
At the High Court in Glasgow yesterday, Burt, of Blackstoun Oval,
Paisley, was found guilty of the rape at the rear of a shop in Greenhill
Road, Paisley, on December 3 last year.
He was also found guilty of threatening and assaulting another woman
by abducting her and forcing her to commit a sex act.
Burt, who has also lived in Inverurie and whose parents come from
Fraserburgh, was told by Lord Clyde that his crimes were ''vicious and
brutal''.
During the trial, the rape victim had told Mr Jock Thomson,
prosecuting, how her ordeal ended when she saw the light of the torches
of two policemen who were checking property nearby.
After hearing the victim's screams, they investigated and discovered
the woman, terrified and naked, with her head shrouded in a turban of
clothes.
The officers heard her assailant scuttle into the bushes and put out
an alert for him. Minutes later, he was arrested.
Although the victim could not identify him, tiny fibres from the woman
were found in Burts' underpants and fibres on her came from his
clothing.

<HEADLINE>Opera's chorus of disapproval. Discord as group votes for strike action over pay</HEADLINE>

THE chorus of Scottish Opera has voted in favour of taking strike
action over the management's pay freeze.
The form of action taken by the 34-strong group has not yet been
decided but may include boycotting rehearsals and striking on
performance days.
The first casualty could be the opening performances of Dvorak's The
Jacobin, which Scottish Opera is scheduled to perform at The Edinburgh
Festival on August 14 and 16.
The results of the ballot, announced yesterday, showed 62% in favour
of industrial action including strike action.
Scottish Opera's marketing and press manager, Ms Roberta Doyle, said
the company was asking the conciliation service Acas to monitor the
situation.
However, while the company was hopeful of finding a solution, Ms Doyle
warned that any solution could not be found for the chorus in isolation.
''If the pay claim is met then we have to look at the rest of the
company and in order to do that we would be looking for #125,000 to
settle a cost of living pay increase for the whole company. We just do
not have that at the moment.''
Mr Drew McFarlane, Scottish organiser for Equity, the British Actors'
association, said that, under law, the chorus members now had seven days
to intimate to their employers what action they planned to take. That
action must be taken within 28 days of that seven-day limit.
Ms Doyle said that if the chorus gave the management notice of its
action today, any action could affect next week's programme of stage,
orchestra, and technical rehearsals. The company's technical dress
rehearsal and stage dress rehearsal are both scheduled for next week. If
either is targeted for industrial action, any performances of The
Jacobin which do go ahead at the Edinburgh Festival could prove to be
under-rehearsed.
However, Mr McFarlane said he hoped that the management of Scottish
Opera would ''see some sense'' before future performances were
jeopardised.
Chorus members came close to taking industrial action last year over a
pay offer of 2.4% but, following the intervention of Acas, a strike was
averted. Central to last year's deal was an agreement that a working
party be set up to attempt to ensure that any future negotiations would
be resolved without taking the chorus so close to industrial action
again.
However, Mr McFarlane said the joint working party had reported the
Scottish Opera chorus was the lowest paid in real terms in the UK, that
it was substantially underpaid in comparison with the Scottish Opera
orchestra, and had recommended the board address these matters. This had
not been done, he said.
He added many chorus members were on salaries of around #11,000 and
were forced to supplement income by family credit. The members are
asking Scottish Opera to make a one-off payment of #42,000 -- around 5%
per singer.
Mr Doyle said: ''The situation is that the recommendations of the
joint working party have been accepted by our board and the chorus. We
have said that all the points we agree on with the chorus from the
working party's document will be implemented when the company is in a
safe position to do so.
''Their claim is in pursuit of an actual pay rise rather than
conditions. That was certainly part of the working party's
recommendations but simultaneous to that happening, it became clear to
us that the organisation's overall funding situation was not getting any
easier. In order to alleviate that, a pay freeze has been implemented
across the board on all 250 of us.
''Other members of the company, some of whom earn less than the
chorus, while not happy about a pay freeze are understanding about the
company's situation. And other members of the company are actively
helping to work towards company unity which will strengthen our case for
increased funding.''

THE possibility of tolls on Britain's motorways moved up a gear
yesterday, with the Government announcing that motorway testing of the
various systems will begin next year. Labour immediately branded it the
Tory toll tax.
Motoring organisations were also critical, warning that tolls could
force thousands of drivers on to less suitable roads, which could lead
to more accidents, congestion, and environmental damage.
The Scottish Tourist Board urged caution with anything that would make
it more expensive for tourists to visit north of the Border.
The testing spot chosen for next year is the M3 in Hampshire.
Motorists will not be charged but companies will test specially adapted
vehicles to see if an electronic system which does away with the need
for staffed toll booths is feasible.
The introduction of such a system is unlikely for at least five years.
Labour transport spokesman Henry McLeish said: ''After the last
election, the Tories got their tax booty from homeowners and families.
Next time round it is the motorists who will pay.''
The RAC also questioned the move, saying that surveys showed that 86%
of motorists were opposed to paying extra to use motorways.
An AA spokesman said: ''We think tolls would force vehicles on to the
A-roads, which are far less suitable for heavy loads of traffic. They
would lead to an increase in accidents, congestion, and traffic jams and
an increase in the annoyance and air pollution that traffic jams
cause.''
Transport Secretary Sir George Young said eight consortia are to take
part in a research programme to test motorway tolling technology. They
will join test track trials going on at the Transport Research
Laboratory at Crowthorne, in Berkshire, before the M3 trials start next
summer.
Motorists will not be inconvenienced, as the trials do not involve
stopping any cars. Instead they will compare microwave and infra-red
systems which use transmitters from roadside beacons or gantries, and
global positioning satellites which send signals which are picked up by
an in-car unit.
The trials will also test various systems for levying charges on road
users and for enforcement.
Sir George said motorway charging offered a number of benefits,
including another source of finance for maintaining and improving roads.
No figure for charges has been set, although a Government green paper
two years ago suggested 1.5p a mile for cars and 4.5p a mile for
lorries.
The technology involved would mean some form of electronic device in
the car which would be registered by roadside equipment. The driver
would pre-pay for a certain number of motorway journeys.
Roadside cameras linked to computers would automatically read the
number plates and show up drivers who had not paid, and they could be
billed separately, probably at a higher rate in order to make buying the
transponders more advantageous.

A GLASGOW man and two other Britons will appear before magistrates in
Malaga today after hashish worth more than #80m was seized from a yacht
yesterday.
A total of 1.2 tonnes of the drug was discovered stowed below deck on
the Jersey registered Gamine de Mer, which was intercepted by a Spanish
Customs launch and helicopter 2.5km off the Costa del Sol.
Mr Gary Sugar, 44, from Glasgow, was arrested along with the vessel's
owner Mr Lawrence Woods, 31, and Mr Anthony Gavin, 30, both from
Liverpool.
Spanish customs officers believe the 36-ft yacht, which left Falmouth
on June 29, was heading for Gibraltar. It aroused suspicion late on
Sunday because it was sailing off the southern Spanish coast without
navigation lights.

THE councillor who has filled the hottest seat in Scottish local
governement for nine challenging and controversial years is to step down
to concentrate on being president of the Scottish Congregational Union.
The Rev David Laing, Strathclyde's jovial chairman of social work, is
to relinquish onerous and stressful responsibilities such as war on
poverty and child abuse.
When the 59-year-old councillor did not stand for the new City of
Glasgow Council, it was obvious his career was about to move in another
direction, although he will be continuing as a community minister in
Easterhouse where he runs a project caring for families suffering from
drink-related problems.
A man steeped in the hurtling conflict of the speedway track, he will
also be continuing his chaplaincy to the Glasgow Tigers, although he has
long since hung up his helmet.
Some of the most stressful and controversial phases of his career have
centred round the vexed question of child abuse and coping with the
incredible levels of publicity that have attended them. He and his
department have been in the firing line over the long-running Ayr child
abuse cases.
He was the man who sent Strathclyde social workers to Orkney to help
the local social work department with the child abuse allegations.
Councillor Laing said: ''The way the courts handle this problem is
still a major concern to me. In my view, we are actually abusing kids in
our courts. The Scottish court system is really digging a hole for
itself in its handling of these situations.
''The social work department is there to protect children and its
ability to do that is weakened by the system we adopt in this country.
''I really find it difficult to see very young children in the witness
box under our adversarial court system and I don't think it helps us get
at the truth of these matters.''
He urged all interested parties to learn from court systems adopted in
other countries. Councillor Laing visited the US earlier this year,
where some states have adopted a system in which prosecution, judges,
police, and the social work departments work more closely than here.
During his nine-year stint as social work chairman, the department
launched a welfare rights programme to assist the elderly and those with
very low incomes to claim millions of pounds of assistance to which they
were entitled. His position as chairman of social work will be filled by
Councillor James Burns, currently vice-chairman.

<HEADLINE>Hanson in #2500m bid for Eastern</HEADLINE>

TAKEOVER activity in the electricity sector took a dramatic turn
yesterday when the Anglo-American industrial conglomerate, Hanson,
launched a #2500m bid for Eastern Group.
The offer is by far the biggest seen so far among the privatised power
generation and distribution firms, coming a week after ScottishPower
launched a #1040m bid for Manweb and within a month of Southern group of
the US bidding a similar sum for South Western Electricity.
While the directors of Manweb and South Western are fiercely resisting
their takeover bids and are urging investors to do the same, the Eastern
board is recommending shareholders accept the 975p per share cash offer.
Lord Hanson, chairman of the group whose interests span bricks to
tobacco and which acquired a reputation in the 1980s as one of the most
aggressive predatory companies, said he was pleased the two boards had
agreed terms on the offer.
''This will bring into Hanson a new major business with first-class
management, under its chief executive John Devaney, with an excellent
growth record since privatisation.''
Mr Devaney has been invited to become executive chairman of Eastern if
the bid is successful. He stressed that it was business as usual for the
firm's employees and its customers, ''who naturally come first''.
Labour's trade and industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, immediately
called for the bid to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. He accused the Government of fostering a ''casino
mentality'' in the privatised utilities without regard for the consumer
interest.
''The least the consumers are entitled to under this regime is a
case-by-case study of how a takeover is likely to affect services,
investment, and regional identity.''
Mr Sol Mead, of the public service union, Unison, said: ''We are
worried about the effect on jobs of this latest bid in the dash to grab
a corner of the lucrative electricity supply market.''

FEW hotter scorchers -- that's the verdict from weather experts as
Britain wipes the sweat from its brow after one of the warmest Julys on
record.
The hot spell is set to continue this month, according to the
forecasters.
As July drew to a close yesterday, the experts were calculating
whether to rank it the third or fourth hottest July of the century. Both
1983 and 1976 saw hotter Julys in the UK, while July 1921 was about the
same as this year.
Temperatures were well above normal throughout last month nearly
everywhere in the UK, said the London Weather Centre.
Top temperatures for the month were 32-33C, with Heathrow and
Lakenheath, Cambridgeshire, both hitting 32C yesterday. However,
temperatures in the low 30s were recorded as far north as Kinloss on the
Moray Firth.
At Glasgow Weather Centre yesterday, staff were waiting for the
official end of July before finalising Scottish data for the month.
However, they were able to give provisional figures for Glasgow
itself. These showed an average temperature of 16.3C, which is 1.6
degrees above normal for July; rainfall 56% above normal; and hours of
sunshine 13% above normal.
Last month was also the seventh month in a row that Glasgow enjoyed
more sunshine than usual.
Across the UK, July was far drier than average, except for South-west
Scotland and Northern Ireland. In those regions, the extra rainfall came
mostly in brief thunderstorms. As much as two inches fell in one day at
Machrihanish in Kintyre.
The heatwave is set to continue. At the London Weather Centre, a
spokesman said: ''We are set for more of the same over the next week.
Most parts of the country can expect a good deal more hot and sunny
weather.
''The only exceptions are possibly coastal areas of North-east England
and South-east Scotland, which will have 17-18C at most, with mist.
Elsewhere it will be in the high 20s and low 30s.''
By the end of the week, another wave of thunderstorms may sweep across
the country, he added.
The heatwave has got bookies hot under the collar, with William Hill
slashing its odds on a record-breaking 100F (37.78C) in mainland Britain
to just 10-1.
The company's odds compiler, Mr David Brown, said: ''We don't want to
appear killjoys but we hope the weather doesn't get too much hotter. You
could say if it tops 100F, we'll get our fingers badly burnt and get a
real sun-tanning.''
The London Weather Centre's spokesman thought the bookies' money was
safe: ''We will get temperatures in the low 90s over the next few weeks
but I don't think it will top 100F.''

THE families of the three children who were brutally murdered at the
weekend last night pleaded for help to catch their killers.
At two emotion-charged news conferences, less than 60 miles apart,
they urged anyone with knowledge of how Robert Gee, Paul Barker, and
Sophie Hook had died to come forward and prevent their attackers from
striking again.
Last night, a man was still being questioned by police in the North
Welsh coastal town of Rhyl, in connection with the death of
seven-year-old Sophie. A second man was released earlier on police bail
pending further inquiries.
Detectives said Sophie was snatched from a tent in her uncle's garden
on Saturday night and strangled. Her naked body was found the next
morning on a nearby beach. She had been sexually assaulted.
Robert, 12, and Paul, 13, were stabbed repeatedly in an apparently
motiveless attack as they fished at a beauty spot not far from their
homes in Eastham, Wirral.
A team of 200 officers is engaged in the hunt for their killer.
Detectives have interviewed a 36-year-old local man and four boys who
were the last to see the victims alive, but stressed the man was ''just
a witness''.
Their deaths were the latest in the UK's lengthy catalogue of savage
child killings, at the hands of people like Robert Black, nurse Beverley
Allitt, and Moors murderers Myra Hindley and Ian Brady.
Other recent victims have included two-year-old James Bulger, battered
to death by two 11-year-olds on Merseyside; Nicola Conroy, 12, fatally
stabbed in front of her school classmates in Middlesbrough; and
Hartlepool three-year-old Rosie Palmer, whose murderer was jailed for
life last week.
The weekend killings seemed to gain an additionally poignant dimension
because of the fact that all three children were engaged in innocent
pastimes during their school holidays.
Canon Trevor Davies, the vicar of Colwyn Bay, said yesterday: ''The
families are so full of self-reproach and I have been trying to get them
to change that. They have done nothing that any other parent would not
have done.
''Children should have the right to camp safely in their back gardens
but I'm afraid this is another aspect of childhood that future
youngsters will be denied. I hope whoever did this can find some strand
of decency to give themselves up.''
Sophie's parents, Christopher and Julie Hook, fought back tears as
they said the ''monster'' who brutally murdered their daughter must be
brought to justice.
Mr Hook, 37, told journalists in Colwyn Bay: ''Julie and I want to
make a heartfelt appeal to anyone who may know anything, however small
the detail, which may help the police find the monster who did this
terrible deed to our beloved Sophie.''
His wife, showing obvious distress, added: ''Sophie was and always
will be to us a vivacious, fun-loving, extremely popular, beautiful,
intelligent child.
''No child could have received or given more love to us, to her
brother and to her two sisters and all her family and friends who will
all miss her very dearly.
''We do need to find the person responsible for this deed. He must be
brought to justice for Sophie's sake and for all our sakes,'' she said,
determined to finish speaking, despite her obvious anguish.
The couple, from Budworth near Winsford in Cheshire, have three other
children: Jemma, nine, Joseph, five, and Ellie, 21 months.
Meanwhile, relatives of Robert and Paul made equally emotional pleas.
Paul's uncle Mr Raymond Williams, looking strained, said: ''I would like
to appeal on behalf of both families for anyone with any knowledge of
how they met their deaths to come forward.
''Both families are devastated. It is the most traumatic thing that
has happened to us.''
Mr Aubrey Edge, the grandfather of Robert, added only: ''Their lives
must not be in vain. It must not happen to anyone else.''
Robert, an only child who lived in Darleydale Drive, Eastham, with
parents Leonard and Catherine, and Paul, who lived with his parents,
Richard and Pat, and 11-year-old sister Hannah, in nearby Rayburn
Avenue, went missing on Saturday during a fishing trip just a mile from
their homes.
Their bodies, both bearing multiple stab wounds, were found on Sunday.
Detective Superintendent Geoff Harrison, the man leading the murder
hunt, said one of the boys could have been enticed away from the pond
where they chose to fish.
Their fishing tackle and mountain bikes were found at the pond where,
it was revealed yesterday, they had been directed by the local man and
the four boys who were fishing elsewhere.
Robert's body was discovered in woodland 60 yards from their fishing
gear. Paul's body was further away on the opposite side of a field
skirting the M53.
Mr Harrison said he was investigating a number of theories but
admitted: ''We just don't know. The possibilities are totally wide
open.'' There was no sign of a ''real struggle'' at the scene.
The boys' school, South Wirral High, yesterday received a stream of
messages of sympathy and support. Deputy head, Mr Alan Favager, said:
''Both Robert and Paul were quiet, unassuming boys. The boys were a
credit to their parents and their school. They will be greatly missed.''
As detectives carried out a detailed search of the murder scene,
parents nearby were closely supervising their children on the streets.
One young mother said: ''We can't believe there is someone out there
who has done this terrible thing. The sooner he is caught the better,
and we can get on with our lives.''
The element of fear was equally tangible in Llandudno, from where
Sophie was abducted as she shared a night in a tent with her
nine-year-old sister, Jemma.
Mrs Eileen Philips, on holiday from Shropshire with her two children,
said she was now extremely nervous about their safety.

THE International Amateur Athletic Federation is to consider a new
anti-doping initiative which was first mooted by The Herald in the wake
of Ben Johnson's steroid-injected charge to Olympic 100 metres gold in
Seoul seven years ago.
The German Athletics Federation yesterday asked the IAAF council
meeting in Gothenburg to study proposals which would force the leading
20 competitors in every track and field event to undergo
out-of-competition tests on pain of exclusion from major championships.
The council has agreed to study in detail their proposal, which calls
for athletes to have at least two training tests in the year before
major championships, with the tests stamped in a special ''doping
passport''.
Federation secretary Istvan Gyulai believes it is unlikely that the
system could be operational before 1999 and there are concerns that less
developed countries may be unable to organise tests.
The DLV also wants the introduction of a major system of independent
flying drug-testing squads, which would test athletes at random world
wide, rather than leave the matter to national federations or sports
bodies.
When Johnson was stripped of his 100m gold in Korea, the testing of
the leading 20 competitors in each event was part of a package of
measures proposed by The Herald to the international federation.
It was also mooted that world records be ratified only if achieved by
a competitor who had been on the testing list for at least a year.
The package was shelved, and doping infractions multiplied. Johnson
even returned to competition, only to be caught a second time and banned
for life.
When Commonwealth 800m runner Diane Modahl was declared guilty of a
doping offence last December -- a verdict overturned on appeal last week
-- The Herald again called for radical measures.
Meanwhile, the British Athletic Federation has launched a vigorous
defence of its fight against performance-enhancing drugs, having come
under attack in a TV documentary last night.
ITV's World In Action programme claimed the BAF undermined its
out-of-season random testing programme by failing to notify Sports
Council anti-doping officers of the home address of world and Olympic
sprint champion Linford Christie.
Federation spokesman Tony Ward insists athletics' out-of-competition
regime is the toughest in UK sport and that Christie had been tested 17
times -- more than any other athlete.
''It does not say in our rules there has to be a home address. It says
there should be a contact address and we have always had a series of
contact numbers for Linford. The idea that a major athlete spends most
of his time sitting at home is quite wrong. A major athlete will spend a
large part of the year training in places like Australia or
California.''
* The IAAF council yesterday decided to submit the Modahl case to an
arbitration panel. The chairman of the IAAF doping commission, Professor
Arne Ljungqvist, said the evidence which persuaded a UK appeal panel to
overturn a previous guilty verdict should be heard within three months.
Last night, Diane Modahl urged the IAAF to think again about referring
her case to arbitration -- and called for a ''summit'' meeting of top
scientists to discuss its ramifications.

THE long-term future of the Fort William sleeper service looks like
being decided in the first week of September.
Meanwhile, Mr Robert Devereux, brother-in-law of tycoon Richard
Branson, and head of Virgin Communications and owner of Eilean Shona
island in Moidart, said last night that speculation that the group was
bidding to become partners with ScotRail in operating the West Highland
sleeper was without foundation.
This had followed reports that he and transport consultant Adrian
Quine had met ScotRail last Friday to make proposals.
Mr Devereux, 40, said from Eilean Shona last night: ''It is easy to
exaggerate my role in all of this. Basically, I gave Mr Quine the use of
a desk and a phone.
''I was acting entirely in a personal capacity as someone who happens
to own a property up here and is very concerned by the threat posed to
the area's economy by the proposed withdrawal of the sleeper to Fort
William. But there is only so much time I can devote to this.
''It is purely a coincidence that I am also a shareholder in Virgin.
But I can state quite unambiguously that Virgin has not changed its
transportation strategy and that does not include the West Highland
sleeper. It is quite outwith the ambit of that strategy.''
If the British Railways Board is to appeal to the House of Lords
against Lord Kirkwood's court order which prevents the sleeper being
withdrawn without proper consultation, it must do so by September 7, the
three-month deadline after its first appeal to the Court of Session in
Ediburgh was refused.
According to a board spokesman yesterday, there was still no decision
on whether to appeal. The board was waiting to see what decisions Mr
Roger Salmon, director of rail franchising, would take.
''As far as I know, all our eyes are on what Mr Salmon puts in his
Passenger Service Requirement for ScotRail -- that could change
everything,'' the spokesman said.
This follows the intervention of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
and ScotRail's proposals to make significant savings from the #2.6m it
costs to run the sleeper by combining it with the Aberdeen and Inverness
services.
The problem for the BR Board, however, is that it is not clear when
exactly Mr Salmon will publish the ScotRail PSR.
Following reports that Mr Devereux is heading a group which is
proposing to introduce three classes of accommodation on the sleeper,
from luxury cabins to economy seating while ScotRail continued to run
the train, a ScotRail spokesman said yesterday: ''It is true that we had
a private meeting with Mr Devereux and transport consultant Mr Adrian
Quine last week, at which they put forward certain proposals.
''We have noted these. If an organisation like Virgin was interested
in becoming involved, obviously we would be pleased to talk.''
The suggestion is that although Mr Devereux would be acting in a
private capacity, the project has the backing of the Virgin hierarchy
and that it might be promoted by Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Holidays.
Speculation last April that Virgin might be interested was rejected by
the company and, last night, a Virgin spokeswoman in London could not
say whether the company's strategy had changed.
A spokesman for Highland Regional Council said: ''The crucial point is
to get the Fort William sleeper in the PSR and we have done everything
we can think of to achieve that.''

Washington,
UN troops, mainly British and French, are ready to fight to defend aid
convoys bound for Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serbs were warned last night.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo adopted a notably robust line as he
arrived in Washington for talks with his US counterpart, Mr Bill Perry.
He said: ''We are there to make sure that we can get supplies through
to the people of Sarajevo.
''And that means that we will fight to defend the convoys that are
taking the vital supplies through to those people.
''Every threat and every ultimatum we issue has to be absolutely
credible. It has to be one that we are willing to see through to the
bitter end.''
He said the UK-French rapid reaction force now based on Mount Igman
overlooking the Bosnian capital would respond to any harassment or
stoppage of convoys and any attacks on peacekeeping troops in the area.
Mr Portillo, who is trying to dissuade the Americans from lifting the
Bosnian arms embargo, was meeting later with Vice President Al Gore and
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole.
Mr Perry said the North Atlantic Council, the political arm of Nato,
could make a decision as early as today on how the alliance might help
protect Bihac from attacks from Bosnian and Croatian Serbs and rebel
Muslims.
Both Mr Perry and Mr Portillo cautioned that the situation around
Bihac was much more complicated than in the Muslim safe haven of
Gorazde, which the allies intend to defend with air strikes on Serb
military positions if the Serbs attack.
''Bihac is particularly problematic. There are five, possibly six
different factions of war there. There is no clear line on the ground
that can be drawn so that we can say: 'If you cross this line, our
ultimatum comes into effect','' said Mr Portillo.
Croatian forces, apparently using the Bihac crisis as an excuse to
mass troops before a possible determined campaign to win back Serb-held
territory in the Krajina region, intensified their push yesterday.
Shelling was directed at areas close to Knin, the self-proclaimed
capital of the rebel Serbs in Croatia.
More than 10,000 Croatian troops were reported to be gathering to the
north-west of Bihac.
A further 10,000 were moving towards the enclave from the south,
bolstered by their stunning capture of the strategic towns of Glamoc and
Grahovo and the severing of the Serb supply route to Knin.
Earlier yesterday, a UN helicopter carrying the UN Commander for
Bosnia, Britain's Lieutenant General Rupert Smith, was hit by small arms
fire and forced to land west of Sarajevo. No casualties were reported.
Smith and his entourage boarded another helicopter in Kiseljak, 12
miles south-west of Sarajevo, and continued to a pre-scheduled meeting
with the Bosnian Serb commander, General Ratko Mladic.
It was unclear who fired the shots or why. A Bosnian army source
blamed the Serb rebels. However, a UN source said both Serb and Croat
forces were in the area and that it was impossible to tell immediately
who fired the shots.
The UN had made its flight path from Sarajevo known to all sides and
had obtained clearance for the flight.
It was reportedly hit in its fuel tank. It immediately dropped below
radar range and flew into Kiseljak.
Lieutenant General Smith later met Mladic and other Serb generals near
Mrkonjic Grad, south of Banja Luka, Bosnian Serb sources said.
A UN source said the meeting was called to discuss the fate of around
3000 Muslims marooned in hills above the eastern town of Zepa.

SEVEN people were injured yesterday when a double-decker bus was in
collision with an articulated lorry.
The driver of the Fife Scottish bus was trapped for more than an hour.
Mr Alan King, 25, of Valley Garden, Kirkcaldy, has serious face and leg
injuries and has been detained in Dunfermline's Queen Margaret
Hospital's intensive care unit.
Six of the passengers on the bus -- the 1.20pm Kirkcaldy to Glenrothes
via Kinglassie -- were also injured in the accident, which happened on
the eastbound dual-carriageway of the Glenrothes-Kinglassie B921 road
near Southfield industrial estate, shortly before 2pm.
Four of them were detained in Queen Margaret Hospital. They are Mr
Richard Bernard, 71, and his wife, Mary, 72, of Forest Road, Cardenden;
Ms Isabella Rutherford, 80, of Cardenden Road, Cardenden, and Lindsay
Hutchison, 16, of Pitlochie Terrace, Kinglassie. Their injuries are not
thought to be life-threatening.
The other two injured passengers, Ms Catherine O'Brien, 58, of Minto
Crescent, Glenrothes, and Mr William Small, 73, of Strathkinnes Road,
Kirkcaldy, were allowed home from Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy, after
treatment.
Workers at a factory on the industrial estate gave first aid to the
injured until more than 20 firefighters arrived, along with police and a
fleet of ambulances. An emergency medical team from Victoria Hospital
gave on-the-spot treatment.
The driver of the lorry, owned by John Mitchell of Grangemouth, was
unhurt but too shocked to speak about the accident. The westbound
carriageway of the road was closed to enable emergency vehicles to gain
access to the crash scene. The road was closed for four hours.
