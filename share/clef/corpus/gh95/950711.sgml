BRITISH Nuclear Fuels plc is to be prosecuted over alleged breaches of
safety rules at the Sellafield plant in Cumbria, the Health and Safety
Executive announced yesterday.
The company's court appearance follows an investigation by the HSE's
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate into an incident on March 16 last
year.
A flask containing spent irradiated fuel elements from Magnox nuclear
power stations had been transferred between buildings at Sellafield
without enough water to submerge fuel, contrary to operating
instructions.
An HSE spokesman said BNFL had reported the incident to the NII
themselves, on the same day, in recognition of the importance of
enforcing the rules.
''Whilst there were no radiological consequences from the alleged
events, the Health and Safety Executive is prosecuting because of the
importance it attaches to the need for the safe handling of irradiated
fuel at all times on the site and to comply with licence conditions,''
said the HSE statement.
Five charges are due to be heard at Whitehaven Magistrates' Court on
July 24.
The HSE spokesman said there had been ''seven or eight'' such
prosecutions against the nuclear industry in the past six years.
A spokesman for the company said last night the event did not result
in any release of radiation or any injuries to the workforce or the
public.
''Systems and procedures have now been put in place to prevent a
recurrence,'' said the spokesman.

DIET, the busiest horse in Linda Perratt's yard, scored on his
thirteenth run of the season at Edinburgh yesterday, leading all the way
in the Dunbar Claiming Stakes.
The nine-year-old gelding, owned by Mrs Mary Clydesdale of Ayr, is a
workaholic, having run on 110 occasions and won 12 times since going to
Cree Lodge seven years ago.
He ran at Hamilton Park only five days ago when beaten by Profit
Release and is entered to run again at Ayr on Saturday evening.
Yesterday, Diet broke smartly from the stalls and stayed on bravely
over the seven furlongs.
Miss Perratt said: ''He's having a great season and running out of his
skin. It was his second success this year, and gave the yard its fourth
winner.''
Soba Up, another consistent type, proved how much she loves racing
around the tight Musselburgh track when she cruised up in the George
Boyd Fillies Handicap and was eased as she crossed the line ahead by a
length-and-three-quarters.
It was Soba Up's fourth win in five starts since winning the Edinburgh
Gold Cup three weeks ago and her third success on this course. She may
run again at Chester this weekend.
Funny Rose (7-1), without a win on the Flat, was given a superb ride
by Daryll Holland to grab the Newbattle Selling Handicap Stakes on the
line and give Rosewell trainer Peter Monteith his first success of the
season. Funny Rose challenged from two furlongs out, making up an
incredible distance to pass Portite Sophie a few yards from the post.
Monteith said: ''If ever a horse deserved to win a race, it's her. She
is so tough and game.'' In the auction that followed, he retained the
five-year-old mare.
Holland completed a 35-1 double when he took the Mill Hill Handicap on
Legal Fiction (7-2).

Nimes, Monday
TWENTY-TWO people, mainly students, were killed and 32 injured when a
Spanish coach overturned on a motorway in southern France early today in
France's worst road disaster in 13 years.
In another accident, four people died and 25 were injured in a
collision between a Slovakian tourist bus and a truck in the Meuse
region of northeastern France, police said.
The Spanish coach, carrying 59 mostly young people from Spain,
Belgium, the Netherlands and France, struck a security barrier on the A9
motorway near Roquemaure, north of Avignon, while overtaking a truck
just before 2am.
It skidded and rolled over several times for 200ft, police, survivors
and local officials said.
''I saw nothing, I was sleeping. The bus braked unexpectedly and then
it pitched forward, overturned and slid for about 50 metres,'' said a
French survivor, who did not give his name. The bus was travelling from
Amsterdam to Barcelona.
''There was panic. People were bleeding and we were all trying to get
out,'' he said.
Police questioned the Spanish driver, who survived, and said they
suspected he may have fallen asleep at the wheel. A back-up driver also
on board the bus was questioned and released.
It was France's worst bus crash since 53 people died in a crash near
Beaune, in the Burgundy region, in 1982.
Emergency services, including several hundred firemen, about 30
doctors and five helicopters took more than three hours to cut all of
the passengers free from the wreckage.
The injured, of whom 15 were listed in serious condition, were
dispersed to hospitals in the nearby cities of Orange, Bagnols-sur-Ceze,
Nimes, Montpelier and Marseille.
A makeshift chapel was set up in a school at Roquemaure to receive the
bodies of the dead. Survivors were taken to the nearby town of
Villeneuve-Lez-Avignon.
Many of the dead were thrown from the coach by the force of the crash,
prompting calls for seat belts to be made compulsory.

ARSENAL completed a #4.75m deal yesterday to bring home England
captain David Platt from Italy to join #7.5m Dennis Bergkamp in a
mouth-watering Highbury partnership.
Platt's arrival on a four-year contract is likely to put him among the
Premiership's top-10 wage-earners -- certainly in the same bracket as
Dutch ace Bergkamp, who is reputed to be earning around #20,000 a week.
It emphasises again the new cash-splash policy the Gunners adopted
even before former manager George Graham was sacked in February. It was
a savage irony that Graham yesterday started his ''trial'' at the
Football Association on charges of receiving irregular payments over
transfers involving Denmark's John Jensen and Norway's Pal Lydersen.
Arsenal dismissed Graham just a few weeks after sanctioning his
purchases of #2.5m for Wales striker John Hartson, #1.75m for Ipswich
forward Chris Kiwomya, and #2.2m for Dutch winger Glenn Helder.

TRANSFER-seeking Andrei Kanchelskis has been told he can leave
Manchester United -- and he could be used as bait to tempt Spurs to part
with winger Darren Anderton.
Manager Alex Ferguson revealed yesterday he had been unable to pacify
the speedy Russian as United's summer of discontent continues.
Kanchelskis will be the third departure from Old Trafford after the
exits of Paul Ince to Inter Milan and Mark Hughes to Chelsea. Now
Ferguson admits he will be stepping up his bid for #5m-rated Anderton.
Kanchelskis could be part of that package with Anderton stepping
straight into his right-wing spot for next season's UEFA Cup contenders.
The announcement is sure to spark further fury among United fans
angered by the sales of Ince and Hughes.
Defending champions Blackburn, Leeds and newly promoted Middlesbrough
are expected to be among the clubs interested in pursuing Kanchelskis,
who is valued at around #4m.

DAVID Murray was in bullish mood yesterday as he announced the signing
of Paul Gascoigne after a summer of negotiations.
''We are a club who delivers,'' he said. ''We said that Paul would be
here and he is.
''I am glad that the Press have stayed with us on this deal because we
have delivered and will continue to do so.''
''We have signed Stephen Wright from Aberdeen already and now we have
signed Paul and we are ready to sign other players.''
The Ibrox chairman also expects that Romanian Florin Raducioiou will
sign next week to further strengthen Rangers' European ambitions.
''We want to do well in Europe after two years of disappointment but
we don't budget for a long run there.
Instead, we budget for being knocked out in the first round and if we
get a run, as we did three years ago, we are very happy.
''But we also have the 10 league titles in succession to look at
because that's a record we want to have.''

WALTER Smith wants Paul Gascoigne to take over the midfield general's
role which was adopted by Graeme Souness when he arrived at Ibrox nine
years ago.
Smith was fairly explicit as he laid out his plans for his team in the
new season and he looked at the Gascoigne role and said: ''He is one of
these players you don't have to tell what to do.
''He is like Graeme Souness and Ray Wilkins in that respect. You put
them into midfield and let them do what they are good at.
''I believe that Paul can make as great an impact as Brian Laudrup did
when he joined us last season.
''We have signed a player who can light up the fans, excite them, and
also be outstanding on the field.
''You don't always have that combination but I think that, in Paul, we
do.
''I will use Paul in as many of our pre-season games as possible to
give him the match fitness he requires so that he is ready for our
preliminary round European Cup tie next month.''

ABERDEEN manager Roy Aitken returned from holiday yesterday and
pledged that the club will keep out-of-contract forward Scott Booth at
Pittodrie, writes Ken Gallacher.
Last week full back Stephen Wright joined Rangers in a deal which will
be settled by a transfer tribunal. Now Booth, like Wright, is a target
for other clubs.
But Aitken claimed: ''We did our best to keep Stephen Wright. We
wanted him to stay and we want Scott Booth to stay and we will be
attempting ot make sure of that.''
Wright criticised the Pittodrie club last week when he said that he
had not been offered a re-signing deal which might have kept him at the
club.
Said Aitken:''We had the impression from the player and his agent that
he wanted to leave. We tried to keep him and we will try to keep Scott
Booth too.
''Certainly the Rangers' offer for Wright is far away from our
valuation.'' Rangers have offered close to #1m while Aberdeen are
looking to double that. A Tribunal may set the fee for a full back at
around #1.5m.

'There are one or
two young
players I saw in
training today
who looked as if
they might be
giving me a kick
up the backside'
THE words every Rangers' fan wanted to hear came in the Ibrox Blue
Room shortly after one o'clock yesterday when record signing Paul
Gascoigne assured the world: ''I'm not here just to recapture the form I
have shown before -- I'm here to do more.''
The extravagant hair-do, the designer luggage, the expensive tastes of
the soccer super star who joined Rangers yesterday in a #4.3m transfer
were pushed into the background by that statement as 2500 cheering fans
stood outside.
Gascoigne was being unveiled in Glasgow as a born-again professional,
looking lean and hungry, and insisting that he wanted to train at both
sessions yesterday with his new team mates.
His press conference was delayed because the one-time playboy had told
manager Walter Smith that he did not want to miss one of the work-outs
with the other players.
It was a different Gascoigne, relaxed, comfortable with the questions
hurled at him by the biggest media presence the Glasgow giants have
probably had to welcome, and able to joke about his own frailties too.
''Normally I would be coming back from Florida with five or six
chins,'' he grinned mischievously. ''But this time I have been working
out while I have been over there.
''And I didn't touch lager at all while I was on holiday. I had a
glass or two of wine and limited myself to one Pina Colada a week,
though I had two on Saturday.
''I feel fitter right now than I have felt for a long, long time. I
have had an extra spell of what you might call pre-season work -- seven
months or so, maybe -- and I feel great. I am almost ready for action.
All I need are a few games and the club has arranged six or seven before
we go into the European Cup ties.
''By the time I get through them, then I guess I will be match fit
because all I have to do is get these friendlies under my belt to get my
touch back.''
Amazingly, after all his football travels, Gascoigne seemed genuinely
affected by his Glasgow welcome yesterday. As the songs from the couple
of thousand fans drifted through the open windows of the Blue Room, he
said: ''I am probably affected as much by this welcome as I was by the
one when I joined Lazio.
''Back then, the welcome at the airport was exciting and a little
frightening, too. This time, right now, I feel as moved as I did then. I
think the people of Glasgow care about the game, and so do I.
''This is a massive club I have joined and I know that -- I knew it
even before today.
''Rangers have shown their faith in me by matching the transfer fee
which Lazio asked for, and now it is up to me to repay that faith. I
intend to do just that.''
Gascoigne, who has undergone 14 operations in the last three years,
does not let that fact concern him. Nor does it worry Rangers who have
had the player undergo the usual thorough medical examination.
All that does seem to prey on the player's mind is getting back into
action. He will do that on July 21 in Denmark when Rangers play the
first of their tour games against Brondby.
By then, Gascoigne will be a part of the Rangers' squad. ''I felt good
today among the other lads,'' he explained. ''I knew one or two of them,
of course, but the rest were all up shaking my hand and even the
apprentices were coming round to wish me all the best. That was nice. In
fact, it was touching.
''And there are one or two of these young players I saw in training
today who looked as if they might be giving me a little kick up the
backside. But I just want to be a part of this club, get to know the
lads, and try to help the youngsters as much as I can -- if I can -- and
take it from there.
''One thing I know from today's training is that I'm among good
players who can pass the ball, and want to pass the ball, international
players, and I just know I'm going to enjoy my time here.
''And that's what I want to do, get back to playing the game and
enjoying it.''
But, of course, Gascoigne would not be Gascoigne and Rangers would not
be Rangers, if winning was not also on the agenda. Predictably, it was,
as the English international player maintained: ''I want to help the
club do well in Europe but I also know that the aim here is to win the
title 10 years in a row and I can be a part of that too.
''I know that the game in Scotland will be tough. That doesn't worry
me. I like it when players get stuck in and that's what will happen in a
lot of the matches and I can handle that. I can give as good as I get in
these games.
''The pressure will not get to me at all. I have known pressure since
I was 18 years old and so this is not going to be any different from
what I have faced at other clubs.
''The expectations will be high from the fans, but I have to meet
these expectations. I am sure that I can do that.''
If he does, to his own and to Rangers' satisfaction, then Gascoigne
said that he would be happy to finish his career in Glasgow.
''Honestly,'' he said, ''if things are as good as they are looking
right now, then I would want to extend my stay here. I have signed for
three years but if I can please Walter Smith in that time, then I think
I would be happy to stay on for a further spell. I'm just 28, remember,
and in football terms, after missing out on so many matches, I look on
myself as a footballing 25-year-old.
''I could see myself signing another contract.''

HE NEVER uses foul language and he doesn't threaten umpires or line
judges with icy cold stares. In fact, Pete Sampras doesn't do anything
wrong and is entitled to expect that he be hailed now as a perfect
champion.
The American shouldn't hold his breath, however, because it seems the
English sporting public will never take him to their hearts, no matter
how many times he walks away with the Wimbledon singles championship. It
seems Pistol Pete just has one of those faces which turn others off.
Even in his hour of triumph the other day the Centre Court crowd were
more concerned about Boris Becker, who had been outplayed by the
23-year-old defending champion, and while their applause for Sampras was
polite, they almost brought the old ivy-clad house down for Becker. How
they fretted over the beaten German, as though he was a defenseless
little soul.
The people who crowd into Wimbledon remain the most peculiar in sport.
They follow no known patterns of logic as they select their heroes and
villains -- witness their affection for a huge lump of a man called Greg
Rusedski, who sees mileage, and maybe even a couple of million pounds
sterling, in denying his Canadian roots to become English -- but then
Wimbledon is more an occasion than a sporting event for most of these
so-called fans. Without fail, on the final day, they pack the place out,
even though there is no possibility of them seeing any tennis.
All that matters on the second Sunday of the two-week long tournament
is the men's final. All other courts lie empty and threadbare. There are
usually minor finals on Court 1, but still the crowds squeeze themselves
into the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club to watch not a lot.
They sit on every available space, picnicking and watching others
watching them. They get to sip some Pimms and congregate around the
outside of the Centre Court, listening to the audience being thrilled
inside. It's like the unwashed at the palace gates, hoping for glimpses
of royals and crumbs from their tables.
They convince themselves they caught glimpses of the great and the
famous who also are attracted to Wimbledon. ''Was that what's-his-name?
That Telly Savalas person,'' an elderly lady asked her friend.
''No, he's dead,'' came the reply.
''You sure? I really think that was him.''
Next time the old dear might see Elvis.
Eventually, after the silence from the Centre Court tells them the
tennis that they haven't been able to see is over, they pack up and
wander off into the night with their key-ring souvenirs and T-shirts.
Weary foot soldiers, secondary supporters who must make do with their
imaginations and grand delusions that they really were part of The
Championships.
If they had gone into Wimbledon village after the men's final around
10pm they might have stumbled across Becker and wife Barbara in their
favourite restaurant. He had just lost a Centre Court final for a fourth
time, but his world continues to spin for Becker no matter what, and
perhaps it his ability to accept to the letter the inscription from
Rudyard Kipling's ''If'' under which the players must walk before
reaching the Centre Court lawn which makes him special.
Few, if any, have met with triumph and disaster in the sporting world
and been able to treat those two impostors the same with the calm and
reasoned approach applied by Becker, who remains the youngest player
ever to have won the men's crown at Wimbledon. He was only 17 when he
first won in 1985 -- he also won in '86 and '89 -- and after having been
beaten in the final by Stefan Edberg in '88, he wondered genuinely why
so many people were anxious to know how he felt.
''I have lost a tennis match,'' he said, ''not a war. No-one was
killed out there today.''
People do like Becker, while they are not sure about Sampras, even
though he may possess the most complete game for grass. They treat him
with suspicion even if other players, especially Becker, try to insist
he is a warm and friendly person who can only compete at the highest
level if he remains focused and detached on court.
Even the villains this year were given more attention than the player
who became only the third in the modern era to win three successive
championships. The bad boys, Tim Henman, Jeff Tarango, and Murphy
Jensen, became the first players to be defaulted at Wimbledon.
Henman struck a ball-girl with a ball, Tarango lost his head during
one of his matches and walked off court, calling umpire Bruno Rebeuh
corrupt, and Jensen failed to show up for a mixed doubles match. Brave
boy, considering his partner was the sturdy Brenda Schultz-McCarthy.
His twin brother Luke, with whom he plays doubles, suggested Murphy
must have been kidnapped, which gave rise to some concern and then
hilarity when the missing link in the family phoned to say he was all
right and that he had gone fishing.
However, the best moment arrived when Tarango's wife Benedicte slapped
the umpire who had upset her man. That one even brought a smile to
Sampras's face.
Perhaps that's all the champ needs, a strong wife who will stand up
for him and go around Wimbledon next year skelping all those who say her
husband has no personality.
Not only does he have a task convincing people he is really human,
even the birds don't care for him. On his way back to his hotel after
practice before his first-round match, Sampras sat in the front seat of
his courtesy car with the sun roof open, and a pigeon timed its dump to
perfection. Precision bombing it was, and the driver of his car wasn't
brave enough to suggest the mess on his mop was a sign of good luck.
Sampras simply retreated further into himself and whacked out at
everyone in sight. Worked a treat, too, and the same tactics will
probably prevail next year. Already he and the women's champion, Steffi
Graf, whose final against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario was the delight of the
tournament, have been installed as odds-on favourites to win again.
Whether the public like it or not, the Pistol will be with us for some
time so perhaps we should make the effort to get to know him a little
better. After you.

SCOTLAND'S Ross Matheson is the defending champion when the Mercury
Communications Challenge begins in Bristol today, but Jeremy Bates once
again resumes the mantle of Britain's No.1 hope.
With Greg Rusedski on Davis Cup duty along with Tim Henman, Mark
Petchey, and Neil Broad, 33-year-old Bates again finds himself
shouldering major responsibility for a home success.
He is top seed in a singles entry of 32 for the tournament at Redland
Green, which carries a first prize of #4800. There is also a 16-pair
doubles competition offering #2066 to the winners.
Bates faces a stiff challenge from such as 6ft 8in Belgian Dick
Norman, whose booming serve proved too much for Stefan Edberg at
Wimbledon.

RAY Illingworth has come out fighting following claims that he
sentenced England's batsmen to third Test torture at Edgbaston.
''I should want a pitch to be up and down in bounce against the West
Indies like a hole in the head,'' said chairman Illingworth following
his team's innings-and-64-run thrashing.
Illingworth is being blamed in some quarters for the fact that
Courtney Walsh, Ian Bishop, and Curtly Ambrose were able to make some
deliveries lift alarmingly while others went through at a
lower-than-expected height.
He had been in contact with Warwickshire -- and groundsman Steve Rouse
in particular -- before the Test . . . and the outcome was a pitch green
in the middle, and bare at both ends.
Illingworth has now taken the unusual step of releasing copies of Test
and County Cricket Board minutes from a meeting held in May.
The objectives laid down for groundsmen were ''at the commencement of
a match the pitch should be completely dry, firm, and true, producing
pace and even bounce throughout, and should, ideally, wear sufficiently
to give spinners some help later in the game.''
Illingworth stressed yesterday: ''That is exactly what I said to the
groundsmen.
''Everyone saw that the Edgbaston pitch was unsatisfactory for Test
cricket. The big thing was the bounce, more than anything else.''
Illingworth has taken his first look at the Old Trafford pitch being
prepared for the fourth Test, which starts a fortnight on Thursday. ''I
won't be saying anything to the groundsman outside those official
guidelines,'' he insisted.
''I still don't think there's much between the two sides.
Unfortunately we've just had a wicket that was much in West Indies'
favour.''
The West Indies were back at Edgbaston yesterday, beating county
champions Warwickshire by 22 runs in a one-day match. Scores:

MICHAEL Johnson tasted his first Swedish athletics success of the year
last night with a panache which hinted there will be more to come when
he returns next month for the World Championships.
Johnson delivered the best of a string of American successes in the
Stockholm grand prix, taking the 200 metres in 20.15secs at the DN Galan
meeting, which was avoided by most Britons because of the the proximity
of their own world trials this weekend. It was the fourth fastest time
of the year.
Mark Crear, not good enough to qualify for Gothenburg, won the 110m
hurdles (13.20) ahead of Allen Johnson and Roger Kingdom who are bound
for Sweden.
Christopher Kosgei recorded the year's best steeplechase time
(8-06.86), four seconds outside the world best -- beating the current
holder Moses Kiptanui despite running without spikes.
Mozambique's Maria Mutola missed the world 1000m record by just five
hundredths of a second. Stockholm winners (US unless otherwise stated):
Men -- 100m: Dennis Mitchell 10.21secs. 200m: Michael Johnson 20.15.
800m: Jose Parrilla 1-45.48. 110m hurdles: Mark Crear 13.20. 400m
hurdles: Danny Harris 48.46. 3000m steeplechase: Christopher Kosgei
8-06.86. 5000m: Shem Kororia (both Kenya) 13:02.80. High jump: Steinar
Hoen (Norway) 2.29m. Long jump: Kareem Streete-Thompson 8.16m. Shot:
Andrei Nemchaninov (Ukraine) 19.86m. Javelin: Jan Zelezny (Czech Rep)
87.78m.
Women -- 200m: Gwen Torrance 22.24. 1000m: Maria Mutola (Mozambique)
2-30.72. 5000m: Tecla Lorupe (Kenya) 15-08.86. 100m hurdles: Olga
Shishigina (Kazakhstan) 12.57. High jump: Inga Babakova (Ukraine) 1.99m.
Javelin: Trine Hattestad (Norway) 64.20m.
* DOUG Walker, 200 metres bronze medallist at last year's AAA
Championships, will travel with his competitive edge even sharper after
having been written off for this weekend's event in Birmingham, writes
Doug Gillon.
Edinburgh student Walker, whose marginally wind-assisted time of
20.53secs places him fourth fastest in Britain this year, was overlooked
yesterday in promotional material for the two-day KP-backed meeting when
World Championship places are at stake.
Solomon Wariso, the defending AAA champion who suffered a three-month
drug suspension last year, has legitimate claims, having clocked 20.51,
while four-time champion John Regis returned to form with 20.52 in his
only victory of the year earlier this month.
But Walker was bemused to learn how the championship promotional
agents were singing the praises of Owusu Dako, Julian Golding, and Doug
Turner, none of whom have ever run as fast as him, legally or wind
aided.''It motivates me more than irritates me,'' said the 21-year-old

EVERYONE who has a fondness for the traditions of the royal and
ancient game will welcome the return of Carnoustie to the mainstream
with its staging of the Scottish Open this week.
No course as magnificent and demanding as the Angus coast lay-out
deserves to be confined to the wings, when a centre-stage position is
its heritage but, even if this is so, there are a lot of questions to be
answered this week which will indicate whether the switch from
Gleneagles to the east coast is justified.
When the sponsorship of the Scottish Open by Bells came to an end last
year it may have been great news for football which benefited by the
whisky company's decision to back the Scottish League, but it left many
people close to the golf scene wondering if the tournament could
maintain its remarkable progress away from the place that had seemed its
natural home.
First started at Haggs Castle as the Glasgow Classic, the tournament
was moved to Gleneagles by Bells eight years ago and went on to reach a
position among the top three in European golf, a status it has
established as the norm.
Attendances were superb, the promotion was brilliant, and the golf
entertaining. Above all, perhaps, the location of the Perthsire course
was as close to central as you can get in this context, where
enthusiasts from both east and west could converge with reasonable ease.
The fact that no single sponsor has taken over the competition makes
it less easy to promote as an entity and the question of attendance can
only be answered on Saturday night when the Scottish Open is over.
It is a golden opportunity for the golf nuts in the north-east to turn
up in great numbers, but whether the western aficionados will be able to
make the trip in large groups might be debatable, especially as they may
have reserved time off for the following week down the coast at St
Andrews where The Open will be the attraction.
The fact that there is a rail strike on Friday, traditionally the most
popular day, does not help matters. These are tricky conundrums that the
organisers hope can at least be partially resolved.
Perhaps no-one should expect too much in the first year of the switch
to Carnoustie and, just as the original tournament needed a few years to
bed into its position, the change of venue may well need time to
establish itself in golf fans' schedule.
What is likely, however, is that the Carnoustie course will ensure a
winner of the highest calibre. There is not much point in comparing two
greatly divergent courses, one the archetypal Scottish links and the
other moorland golf of high quality, but there is no question that for
the professionals Carnoustie is the far greater test.
You need only look at the men who won The Open there before it was
removed from the rota to appreciate the type of player who wins at the
place. Tommy Armour, Henry Cotton, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and Tom
Watson are the five whose names are associated with that honour and you
would be hard pushed to deny the brilliance of any one of them.
The Scottish Open has had a habit of throwing up relatively unexpected
winners and, while that should not detract from the quality of their
play, the list of names does not ring quite as impressively as that
little Carnoustie lot.
There have been superstar successes, like Bernhard Langer, who won the
inaugural event at Haggs Castle in 1983, when it was the Glasgow
Classic, and Ian Woosnam, who has won twice but often enough the man at
the top of the leaderboard has not been successful at the highest level.
Mike Allen, Carl Mason, Jesper Parnevik, and Peter O'Malley, who are
among the other winners, are fine players but not yet, at least, in the
top bracket.
The comparison is not entirely fair as we are using results of The
Open against the Scottish event, which does not have quite as
star-packed a field.
Even so, it seems probable that the man who is declared winner on
Saturday night at Carnoustie will be a world-renowned player capable of
taking on a world champions' test.
It might be that the switch from Gleneagles will provide Colin
Montgomerie, for instance, with his best chance yet to win the title he
covets second only to the majors.

FOREST Cat can land the Hartleys Jam Fillies' Rated Stakes on the
first day of Newmarket's July meeting.
Julie Cecil's filly has held a multitude of entries since winning a
#10,000 handicap at Sandown at the end of May but this is her first
outing since defeating Comanche Companion on that occasion.
Undefeated in the three outings since her debut fourth, Forest Cat has
come on in leaps and bounds and must rank as one of the gamest fillies
around.
Her courage was brought to the fore at Sandown where she had to
overcome all sorts of problems in running, including being squeezed
inside the distance, to get the better of the wayward runner-up, who
edged to the right, inside the last furlong.
One of the previously mentioned entries made for Forest Cat was in
tomorrow's Falmouth Stakes.
Today's handicap looks an easier opportunity than that Group 2 contest
and the broad hint is taken with Forest Cat a confident nap.
The Group 2 Princess of Wales' Stakes is arguably the highlight of the
day's card and sees Vodafone Derby third Presenting make his belated
reappearence following his excellent Epsom performance.
John Gosden's charge was due to contest the Budweiser Irish Derby last
week but injured himself when being loaded on to the plane bound for the
Curragh.
Despite being cut and bruised in the incident, Presenting has
recovered well according to the trainer and, although he pits the son of
Mtoto against older horses for the first time, Gosden obviously feels
his charge is well up to the task.
It won't be easy with such as Needle Gun and Right Win in opposition
but with the ground and distance in his favour -- he stayed on really
well at Epsom -- Presenting should get the better of his seniors.
* SUSAN Piggott is to retire from training at the end of the season
after eight years at the helm in Newmarket.
Reduced to a stable strength of 10, she plans to assist her son-in-law
and daughter William and Maureen Haggas after sending out her final
runners, probably in the autumn.

SCOTTISH OPEN:
THE paradox of Carnoustie is that although compared with St Andrews,
Hoylake, and Prestwick, its links came much later on to the rota of
championship courses, the almost complete absence of international
events of importance for the past 20 years has meant that as many as
three generations of professionals are strangers to it.
The first of the five Open Championships played there was in 1931 and
the last in 1975, essentially because the complex and expanding
infrastructure inseparable from all modern sports could not be
accommodated and, for a time, the condition of the course itself fell
below acceptable standards.
With the start tomorrow of the Scottish Open Championship, to be
played on a links for the first time after 10 years inland, recognition
has been restored as respect will as surely be admitted by these
''lost'' generations of players.
And this latest page in Carnoustie's history had hardly been turned
than in March the Royal and Ancient Club announced that The Open itself
would return in four years' time. Not as redolent of history as St
Andrews or as spectacular in setting as Turnberry, perhaps, but for the
austerity of its appearance and the unrelenting nature of its
examination, its character is all its own.
The unavoidable abandonment of Carnoustie was all the more frustrating
given the place in golf's history it had long since established for
itself.
Like its more fabled Fife cousin across the Firth of Tay, it is a
public course and as long ago as 1527 it was said of one, Sir Robert
Maule, that when not hunting or hawking ''he excersisit the gowff and
oft-times to Barry lynks, when the wadsie (ie wager) was for drink'' --
another example of things remaining the same the more they appear to
change. Moreover, Carnoustie established and then confirmed its pedigree
by producing Open winners of the highest calibre in Tommy Armour, Henry
Cotton, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and Tom Watson.
Mention of these names -- all but Cotton either American-born or whose
games were brought to maturity there -- recalls that few golfing towns
have exported so many players who spread their influence and their
methods in the New World, not to mention elsewhere.
The Smith brothers -- Willie, Alex, and Macdonald -- and Stewart
Maiden, who taught the young Bobby Jones, all came from Carnoustie, like
many others from Scotland who were recruited to teach players and design
courses, particularly around the turn of the century when the
transatlantic game was becoming popular instead of merely fashionable.
But the origins were primitive. In 1830 there was a layout of 10
holes. No flagsticks swayed in the snell Angus winds, tees were made by
digging sand from previous holes, which on frosty mornings were made by
greenkepers using mallets and chisels. But, beginning in 1842,
Carnoustie began its emergence from obscurity. Alan Robertson travelled
from St Andrews to design a new 10-hole course, which was extended 30
years later to 18 by Old Tom Morris. Then, in 1926, James Braid was
recruited to devise a championship course of aggressive character whose
challenge was further reinforced in 1930 with the design of its
notoriously severe finish.
Further alterations and refinements have been completed in time for
Carnoustie's revival as a focal point of British golf. Bunkers have been
introduced at the first, fourth, and fifth, the third green has been
reconstructed to allow for more pin placements, and the sixth green has
been relaid. The twelfth and probably the eighteenth will be played for
forward tees but the par will remain at 72 and, although the length of
7187 yards is formidable by any standard, it still falls some little way
short of the 7252 yards which in 1968 made it the longest Open
Championship course in history.
The attention to the sting in the tail delivered by the last three
holes tends to make the 15 others overlooked. But as the Masters
champion, Ben Crenshaw, said yesterday during his second reconnaisance:
''The course is every bit as strong as I thought it would be. It is
well-balanced and the short holes are particularly good.''

WALKER CUP
AT least three members of the Scotland side which beat England 6-1 in
the final of the European Amateur Team Championship in Antwerp can now
look forward to making a Walker Cup debut against America in September.
Eight of the 10-man Britain and Ireland team for the match at Royal
Porthcawl will be named later this week and British champion Gordon
Sherry, Barclay Howard, and Stephen Gallacher -- nephew of Ryder Cup
captain Bernard -- were all stars as the Scots avenged four previous
final defeats by England.
Sherry and Gallacher were assured of places in any case, but Howard's
4 and 3 victory over Bristol's Gary Wolstenholme, Amateur Champion in
1991, should have sealed a call-up for a man who is playing the best
golf of his career despite having been unemployed for more than two
years.
Wolstenholme will be on tenterhooks waiting to see if he has done
enough. But the experience of Dorset's Lee James, last year's amateur
champion and third best individual at the World Team Championships in
Paris last October, ought to guarantee him a place.
Ireland and Wales, respectively fifth and seventh in Belgium, will
hope to have at least one player named at this stage -- Padraig
Harrington and Bradley Dredge have both faced the Americans before.
And that could leave English champion Mark Foster, from Worksop, plus
Swindon clubmates David Howell and Gary Harris competing for two places
with Wolstenholme and Scots duo Alan Reid and Graham Rankin.
The ninth and tenth members of the side will be selected next month
after the national championships and also the British Mid-Amateur
(over-35s) at Sunningdale.

Doug Gillon discovers a Borders bargain
ONCE upon a time, and a very good time it was, too -- for it was
called one's youth -- ordinary folk played golf more or less where they
pleased. One did not require an income to gladden the heart of a senior
electricity or water board executive to afford the green fees of
Scottish courses like Gleneagles, Royal Dornoch, and the Old at St
Andrews, or other Open Championship venues -- such as Troon, Turnberry,
and Carnoustie.
Fathers would decant with their sons on two or three-day holidays, or
even for a week. Groups of lads would escape the wife for a few days.
Domestic friction was minimised, for the cost did not nuke the family
budget.
But times have changed. At some of these courses, having paid one's
green fees, one would now be pushed to find enough change out of #100 to
buy a second round of drinks for the four-ball. Indeed, hotel residence,
at considerably more than #100 per night, can sometimes be a
precondition of being allowed to tee off.
Newer courses, such as Loch Lomond, have a pricing and access policy
which will, forever, put it beyond the means of the ordinary player.
One consolation is that many clubs in Spain and Portugal, where costs
also soared higher than a Ballesteros wedge, are now being forced to cut
their fees. They have discovered there is a limit to the depths of the
golfer's pocket.
But until such time as the bawbee drops in Scotland, what are we to
do? Take comfort, for help is at hand.
We were recently made aware of some remarkably economical deals which
restore the game to the means of the ordinary mortal -- not in some
remote area, but easily accessible from Scotland's central belt -- the
forgotten, even undiscovered, golfing country of the Borders.
There the game can come as cheap as #6.60 a round.
The Scottish Border Tourist Board, in conjunction with Pringle and
Scottish Border Golfing Safaris, have introduced a Freedom of the
Fairways package.
Purchase of a passport allows access to up to 10 of the following 17
courses in one week: Duns, Eyemouth, Ladhope (Galashiels)*, Hawick*,
Hirsel*, Innerleithen, Jedburgh, Kelso*, Lauder, Melrose, Minto*,
Newcastleton, Peebles*, Selkirk, St Boswells, Torwoodlee*, and West
Linton*. (Asterisked courses are 18 hole.)
The passport, valid for weekdays only, comes in three-day (#43 for
adults, #21 for age-17 and under) and five-day (#66, and #34
respectively).
A maximum of 36 holes is permitted on any one course. If your stamina
is up to playing 36 holes a day for five days, it works out at #6.60 per
adult round, and #3.40 for juniors.
There is nothing to stop outings using the passport, but some courses
have restrictions on groups, so check with individual clubs first.
On a sampling tour of what the Borders have to offer, we recently
played The Hirsel (extended to 18 holes last year), Torwoodlee (whose
second nine opened in May), and Hawick, otherwise known as Vertish Hill,
for reasons which were to become painfully apparent.
The Hirsel (6092 yards, par 70) lies close to the Border, at
Coldstream, and is a parkland course providing a fair challenge. Good
scoring is possible for big hitters, who, in summer, will find some
par-4s driveable, but there are two par-5s, and large, mature trees, to
inhibit even those of a John Daly disposition.
It will be a much more searching test when the vast number of recently
planted trees mature. Beware of the par-3 fourteenth, with the river
across the front of the green. Under-clubbing is the rule, rather than
the exception, for the visitor.
The ground has bedded down so well that it is hard to believe the
extra nine holes are so new.
Torwoodlee (6018 yards, par 70), less than 10 minutes from Galashiels,
opened their back nine to celebrate their centenary this year. The
original nine-holer was hard to beat, and though there are a few bare
patches, responding well to greenkeepers' efforts in the new section,
even that part of the course is among big, mature trees which lend the
whole course character. It will be a track of some distinction before
long.
Both courses provide glorious views, but neither match the panoramic
vistas of Hawick (5929 yards, par 68) which, however, are enjoyed at a
price.
I genuinely feared for my partner, who had recently undergone heart
bypass surgery. Tell the truth now. I also feared for myself, and
watched in awe as Herald columnist Bill McLaren fair scampered over a
course whose opening holes are laid out after the hairpin fashion of
Alpe de Huez.
Even goats should be roped together at Vertish, the only course I have
ever seen where some fairways are lined with wooden boards to stop the
ball rolling hundreds of feet.
All three clubhouses offer good catering in a friendly, informal
atmosphere.

IN a medal round, you are playing with a 28-handicap novice who hits
his ball into a thicket. His actions indicate that he intends to play
the ball as it lies.
Having seen and been involved in great disasters in such circumstances
when things go from bad to worse, you stop him, intending to be helpful,
with the words: ''Come on now, think about it. Can you really get your
ball back out. Wouldn't you be better declaring it unplayable and
lifting it out under penalty?''
Are such remarks legitimate?
NO. You are penalised two shots for giving advice (Decision 8-1/16).
Information on the rules is not advice and you can tell him his options
but you must take care not to influence his decision.

This week's tip comes from John Scott, the professional at Ralston
Golf Club, Paisley.
EVERYBODY lands in rough, but not everyone can make a successful
escape.
There are certain key points that must be followed.
First, grip the club tighter than normal.
This will help ensure that the club-face doesn't get tangled in the
rough as you hit the shot.
The stance should be open -- the feet, knees, hips, and shoulders all
aiming left of target (similar to a bunker shot) -- and the ball should
be around the middle of the stance.
The club-face should also be laid open.
Now, swing the club on the line of the feet, hips, and shoulders, and,
coupled with the open club-face, this will result in a cutting action
from which the ball will pop out and, hopefully, end up on the green.
Keep the swing smooth and accelerate through the shot.
A full follow-through is essential.
When you do play out of the rough, imagine you are playing a bunker
shot.
The feeling of sliding the club underneath the ball should be the same
-- only on this occasion it is out of deep grass instead of sand.
Also, remember that there will be no spin on the ball, so aim to land
well short of the target to allow the ball to run up to the hole.
The main faults when playing from the rough are having too loose a
grip, standing too square at address, or standing open, but then aiming,
and swinging, along the target line.
The final point to remember is -- practice makes perfect.

THERE were outright winners in both the women's categories this week,
but the men had to be content with sharing the honours.
Beth Dyer has had her handicap at Bishopbriggs cut from eight to six
after her gross 73 (+1), the only entry among the women's scratch scores
to qualify -- meantime at least -- among the top-10 for the season.
Other scratch scores of interest were four-handicapper Alison Hendry's
73 over Colville Park, just a few days after having finished joint-third
in the club June Medal at Hamilton. Mrs Hendry, who recently won the
club championship, shot an 80 (net 76) behind club colleague May Hughes
(off three) whose 74 (net 71) put her on the +2 mark.
Also at +2 was Ruth Rankin -- one of our joint-winners at +1 the
previous week -- through a 76 (75) in the Lanark stroke event, a feat
she almost matched two days later when her 77 was beaten by a better
inward half for the Captain's Prize.
Another outright winner and lady in form was Ralston's Mary Scobie,
who, not content with having won a Stableford the week before, produced
a net 61 (-10) in the club's July Medal, winning the Cancer Relief
Trophy. All good things come to and end, however, and her banditry off
35 is a thing of the past -- her handicap is cut to 30.
Irvine's Alex Gourlay, with a 68, and Lanark's John Bauer, 66, share
the men's scratch prize at five under, both improving by one shot on our
season's leaderboard, having been already pencilled in at -4. That
latter score no longer looks good enough to make our finals day, with
six weeks to run. John's Lanark colleague, John Martin, was among those
at -3 this week.
Three handicappers were tied at 11 under -- Kilmarnock Barassie's Gary
Torbett, Fereneze pensioner Peter Mitchell, and Brian Campbell with a
net 59 at Bothwell Castle. Even that net score was beaten -- although
not, of course, in comparison to par -- by Lochgilphead'sStephen Lovie,
who made use of his 12 handicap to win the Saturday Medal by six shots
with a net 54.

<HEADLINE>Scottish NFU wary of English legislation. New law for tenants</HEADLINE>

THE legislation covering rented land has long been one of the most
contentious of all issues, despite the fact that the tenanted sector has
been in decline in Scotland over the last 50 years with only one-third
of farms not owned by farmers.
Traditionally acquiring a tenancy was the first step on the farming
ladder, but over the past 10 years landlords have been exceedingly
reluctant to let under the terms of the Agricultural Holdings Act lest
they gave total security to tenants with the consequence but the value
of the land might be reduced by as much as 50%.
Pressure for change has been particularly strong in England and Wales
and this resulted in the passing of the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995
which becomes effective on September 1.
Basically this legislation creates a freedom of contract situation.
The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, following a recent survey,
said this would bring another one million acres of let land on to the
market.
In Scotland, the picture is different with the NFU and the Scottish
Landowners' Federation at loggerheads. The SLF clearly state that they
wish to follow the English pattern while the NFU for the moment prefer
to stick to the status quo using limited partnerships to get round the
security of tenure problem.
Scottish NFU council convener of the legal and commercial committee
Jim Wyllie made this clear when he said: ''I doubt that the changes in
England will release significantly more land. There may be some
benefits, but I think it would be prudent for us to wait and watch what
happens. If things come to fruition we will be the first to engage in
discussions.''
Meanwhile, the Tenant Farmers' Association, which operates only in
England and Wales, has issued a series of guidelines for its members
over the new classification effective from September -- the Farm
Business Tenancy -- which echo many of Mr Wyllie's misgivings.
The chairman of the TFA, John Haydon, speaking yesterday at the Great
Yorkshire Show in Harrogate, said: ''The problem is that the very
individual nature of the new FBT, coupled with the risks that it would
be very easy to slip from an existing (secure) tenancy into a new one,
mean that any tenant being asked to make a change in an existing
agreement should as a matter of urgency take specialist advice.
''Anyone who is certain they want to retain their existing succession
rights should hold on to their current tenancy agreement.''
Mr Haydon's warnings relate chiefly to inheritance tax where at
present only working owner-occupiers enjoy 100% relief. However, in
England and Wales, again from September 1, landlords who let FBTs will
also gain this considerable tax advantage. Hence the pressure from some
owners to persuade tenants to make a change.
Mr Haydon added: ''Just varying the tenancy is not enough. In
virtually all cases actual surrender and regrant is needed. The tax
advantage lies entirely with the landlord, so if a tenant is asked to do
a surrender and regrant he too should have some commercial benefit.''
Even if the tenant does gain something from the change, such as a
reduction in rent, there may be capital gains tax implications. However,
the chief executive of the TFA, John Rennie from East Lothian, while
keen to point out the possible pitfalls, believes the new act is a move
in the right direction.
He added: ''We are already seeing existing large-scale landowners such
as the Crown Estates, the Church Commissioners, the Duchy of Cornwall
and the Duke of Westminster offering new tenancies under the act and the
terms look attractive.''
In Scotland, the NFU through a specialist sub-committee deals with
landlord tenant issues, but Mr Rennie does not rule out the possibility
of stretching his wings northwards.
He said: ''We're keeping a watching brief on Scotland, and perhaps
there may be ways we can help.''

ENVIRONMENT advisers with the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group in
Scotland expect to face a heavier workload in the years ahead.
At an open day near Blairgowrie in Perthshire yesterday, David Bell,
FWAG's new national chief executive, said there was a growing demand
from farmers who want mainstream advice on environmentally-responsible
land management.
The organisation's Scottish co-ordinator, Hilary Barker, said they now
had 19 advisers in the field, compared to 15 a year ago and anticipated
almost 2000 calls for the use of their services. ''Farmers and
landowners are beginning to realise the opportunities that exist for
saving money while improving the environment they manage,'' she said.
''They find ways to reduce costs in fertilisers and herbicides while
improving the agricultural environment involved in development
programmes for both livestock and crop husbandry.''

BORDER Television is doing nicely, but sees little room for growth in
its small regional television market and is seeking to expand through
radio, writes ROBERT POWELL.
Turnover and pre-tax profits rose nearly 18% in the year to April 30,
but the improvement was mainly due to a one-off boost in television
advertising revenue.
Finance director Peter Brownlow said the way ahead lay in radio, since
it was difficult for Border, one of the UK's smallest ITV companies, to
expand further in its small television area of Cumbria and the Scottish
borders.
Border spent an estimated #1.1m on launching Century Radio in
Newcastle in September last year and should hear next month whether its
application for a licence to start up another station in nearby
Middlesburgh has been successful.
''What we have done is to refocus,'' Mr Brownlow said. ''Rather than
having a whole host of holdings in the 20% to 30% range we would much
rather have effective control of a radio station.''
This change in strategy led Border to sell its minority stakes in
Central Scotland Radio, the operator of Scot FM, and Bay Radio, a small
radio station in Lancaster, at a net profit of #291,000.
Mr Brownlow said Border was happy to retain its minority stakes in
three other local radio stations for the time being, but the group had
its eye on new licences coming up for regional radio stations in
Yorkshire and the Midlands.
With cash balances of #1.8m at the end of April, Border would finance
any further expansion in radio from its own resources, he said.
Pre-tax profits increased to 17.8% to #1.93m for the year to April 30,
while turnover rose 17.6% to #11.61m. Border celebrated by raising the
full dividend 20% to 4.8p with a 2.9p final payout.
Most of the improvement was due an exceptional 16% increase in
advertising revenue after a strengthening of Borders' joint sales
arrangement with Granada.
The finance director said he expects advertising revenue to increase
by a more modest 7%-8% during the current year, in line with the ITV
average.
Border shares moved up 2p to 216p and may become more actively traded
when the company moves from the Unlisted Securities Market to a full
stock exchange listing later this year.

CAIRN Energy will nearly double its oil and gas production to 9000
barrels of oil equivalent per day with the #35.75m purchase of a 10%
stake in the Gryphon North Sea oilfield from Clyde Petroleum.
The deal holds tax advantages for both sides and will give
Edinburgh-based Cairn a new cash cow to finance the development of its
gas fields in Bangladesh.
The 4000 barrels per day of crude production from Gryphon comes on top
of 1700 barrels per day equivalent (bpdoe) of new gas output from
Holland Sea Search Holdings (HSSH), which Cairn bought for #17.8m
between April and June.
Cairn chief executive Bill Gammell said the combined output of the two
acquisitions would raise Cairn's annual revenue to about #20m from #8m.
The extra cash will help finance the development of gas fields in
Bangladesh, where Cairn plans to invest up to #9m over the next 12
months.
Edinburgh-based Cairn announced a one-for-three rights issue at 80p
per share to raise #16.9m net towards the purchase of Clyde Petroleum
(North Sea), whose main asset is the 10% stake in Gryphon.
Loans from the Bank of Scotland will finance the remainder of the
acquisition, which is effective from July 1, subject to the approval of
Cairn shareholders.
Mr Gammell said Cairn would be able to offset corporation tax losses
incurred in previous years against revenue from Gryphon.
''The oilfield's production will actually come to us tax-free for
about the first free years,'' he said.
The deal also brings tax benefits to Clyde Petroleum, as well as an
exceptional gain of #7.5m which will be posted in the second-half
results.
Clyde managing director Roy Franklin said the sale of 10% of Gryphon
to Cairn and the proposed sale of a further 3.5% to a different
purchaser would reduce Clyde's gearing from 60% to less than 40%.
The #48m income from the two transactions would also leave Clyde well
poised to make future acquisitions in the UK, the Netherlands, Australia
or South America, he said.
Cairn shares slipped [1/2]p to 89p, while Clyde Petroleum rose 1p to
42p.

ROY FAUDREE sits, niched in a den of media technology. To the right of
him are tape decks, to the left of him are video machines. Behind him is
a monitor, above him there are camcorders.
He is cocooned by devices that capture images, hold them hostage, then
release them after the event; devices that can rewind reality, cut and
paste fact, make fictions out of everyday life. And in the midst of all
these machines that have him -- and so much else -- taped, Roy Faudree
tries to get in touch with his true self.
In the process, he roams bleakly -- and with acid illuminating wit --
through the labyrinth of identity. Problems inside his marriage expand
into a running commentary on male/female roles and the desperate cry of
''somebody has to be the wife'' comes with the attendant suspicion that
the person (by default) is now him.
He beefs about this work; we soon gather he's a scriptwriter of sorts
and that his actress wife is doing better than him, and managing it
without him.
Now this could sound more moanologue than monologue, and there is a
distinct whiff of burning martyr in the text. But Dupe is cleverer, more
rewarding than that. Faudree (previously with the Wooster Group) is in
pursuit of what constitutes reality in our lives. As the monitor floods
with altering images, including another Faudree who talks to his
flesh-and-blood self, or a tape machine that plays back an earlier
conversation, we begin to doubt his sincerity, question his integrity.
Does he actually have a true self?
This is one of those marvellously tricky, astute performances that you
want to see again, just to pick up on the many fine details -- a strong
hint, here, to the CCA to bring Faudree and the No Theater back soon,
and for a longer stint.

PROBLEMS in the supply chain have prevented miniature disc-drive
pioneer Calluna achieving the break-even goal it set when it floated in
October, writes IAN McCONNELL.
At the time of its #10.1m placing, the Fife-based company forecast a
move into the black last month. Yesterday it announced it had more than
trebled turnover to #991,000 in the year to end-March.
However, in spite of this, it has been unable to reach shipment levels
compatible with its original break-even objective.
With the developing company continuing to invest in sales and
marketing, engineering and manufacturing, annual pre-tax losses grew
from #1.69m to #2.67m.
Managing director Doctor Norman White said this was in line with
publicly-undisclosed projections issued to some institutional investors
at the time of flotation.
Shares in Calluna, which rocketed from their 65p strike price to 92p
when they made their debut on the Unlisted Securities Market on October
31, have weakened since. Yesterday, they lost another 3p to 55p.
Production of the company's 1.8-inch ''callunacard'' disc-drive was
held back during the first half of 1995 by a number of problems in the
supply chain.
Although most have now been resolved, uncertainty remains over the
assured supply of one key component, most vital to the company's
highest-capacity 260-megabyte disc-drive. Because of its high-precision
nature, this component, sourced from the Far East, is difficult to
manufacture.
The demand for Calluna's disc-drives, which have applications not only
for lap-top and notebook computers but also in the telecommunications,
automotive, digital camera, aircraft and industrial instrumentation
fields, appears to be there.
Calluna, based in Glenrothes, said the first quarter of its current
financial year, to end-June, would be the highest to date in revenue
terms, exceeding the previous best of #360,000.
Calluna's current sales order backlog significantly exceeds turnover
for the year to end-March. Dr White expects the company to break-even at
some point during the current financial year.
With the supply problem outstanding, he said it would be foolhardy to
be more specific about the likely break-even date at this stage.

LAST year two friends and I compiled our personal collection of pop
kitsch classics. The only person to appear three times in the list was
the great (and we assumed late) Dean Friedman. But now, courtesy of
Channel 4's Big Breakfast, which feted him for much the same reasons,
here he is in Glasgow all the way from Petesville, New York, playing to
a full house on the Ferry.
And the man is everything you remember and more. In the line of great
American troubadours, imagine Jonathon Richman without the charm, Loudon
Wainright III without the wit, Randy Newman without the IQ, and there
somewhere lies Dean. He treated us not only to his hits but also to
various works in progress stretching back over some 15 years, all
performed with his Lloyd Grossman whine.
This extended paean to the suburbs, seemingly all inspired by his
unfortunate friends, contained gems including Typical Family and the
truly distasteful Nookie In The Post.
But it was the hits we were there to hear, and he didn't disappoint.
Plucked from the audience, Yvette, who knew all the words, and the
hapless Alan, who knew none, helped out on one. We got the title track
of the classic second album, Well, Well Said The Rocking Chair, the
soaring vocals of Ariel, a marvellously poignant pose held at the end of
Woman of Mine, and -- of course -- the peerless Lucky Stars.
The invitation for vocal assistance for that one led to a stampede
that left people trampled underfoot, before two lucky ladies were
selected to do their bit.
The crowd, of course, went wild. I found comfort in drink. You really
had to be there.

THE Government is to go ahead with its reform of the taxation of
state-issued securities and bonds but is to exclude the vast majority of
private investors from liability. It also intends to go ahead with the
introduction of gilt strips, a new type of bond, writes CHRIS STONE.
A consultative paper from the Inland Revenue in late May proposed that
capital gains on gilts and bonds should be made taxable and treated as
income. At present, the income from gilts and bonds is subject to income
tax but capital gains on gilts and most bonds are tax free.
The financial services industry had strongly objected to the Revenue's
proposals, arguing in particular that certain types of security should
be treated as shares rather than bonds, notably zero dividend preference
shares issued by investment trusts. Private investors who used savings
plans to provide for retirement or school fees would be hard hit by the
new system.
This argument has clearly been taken on board by the authorities and
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said that to protect the interests of private
investors, the new regime will not apply to to private investors with
holdings of #200,000 or less.
In addition, it will not apply to zero coupon Preference shares, or to
low coupon gilts widely held by individuals. So the financial services
industry appears to have won the bulk of the concessions it was seeking.
Probably fewer than 4000 private investors -- 0.5% of the total --
will be within the new regime. And these will be able to claim tax
relief if they sell gilts and bonds at a loss. There will be special
rules to ensure that gilt and bond unit trusts are not disadvantaged,
and that there is tax exemption for corporate bond PEPs.
The introduction of the new regime is scheduled for April 1, 1996, for
companies and until April 6, 1996, for the few private investors with
nominal holdings of more than #200,000.

Youth puts its best foot forward this week at a much-expanded Scottish
Youth Dance Festival. Mary Brennan explains why the event is flourishing
in Glasgow
WHAT stretches from Shetland, has a toehold in Wales, makes moves in
Nuremberg and is currently springing into action in Glasgow? The
Scottish Youth Dance Festival, that's what. From now until the end of
the week, groups of youngsters from all over Scotland and beyond --
there are indeed participants from Gloucester, Wales and Nuremberg --
will come together to make dance.
It's the eighth year that the SYDF has been in operation and it's
their largest festival yet. Morning, noon, and afternoon, about 200
youngsters will get into a cheerful lather as they do 90-minute classes
in various techniques, try out new steps or devise their own pieces.
Evenings are given over to performances.
A quick glance at the timetable shows the range of activities on
offer, as well as the impressive calibre of the teaching staff. Three
members of CandoCo are among the tutors, as are Don Hartley and Brigid
McCarthy who (as Incognita) are among Scotland's most innovative dance
makers.
Last week found them performing in gallery and outdoor spaces as part
of site-specific trilogy Frontier.
As well as being able to explore different aspects of contemporary
dance, youngsters at the SYDF can also sample the traditions and rhythms
of flamenco, Latin American, and Zanzibari, which includes some
belly-dancing. Or they can tap into step dancing and discover with Mat
Melins how certain percussive steps have put their stamp on so many
cultures.
But acquiring technique is only half the story -- it's what you do
with it that's really interesting. And here, the SYDF is keen to
encourage everyone to think, and work, creatively. Time is given over to
the devising of new pieces that will be shown, an informal sharing, at
the end of the week.
As much as anything, what these sessions develop are social skills and
the ability to co-operate and collaborate with strangers. Because the
groups are split and mixed up for these workshops, there is a tremendous
mingling of backgrounds and personalities -- though all joined by a
shared enthusiasm for dance.
And enthusiasm is certainly what shines through at every stage of this
event. It's the first time the SYDF has been based in Glasgow. The team
decided to use the run-up time to the festival by getting to know some
of the local communities, perhaps even interest some of them to take
part in the festival itself. And so they ran an outreach project which
stretched as far as Paisley, setting up workshops at Maxwellton Adult
Training Centre.
The organisers have been thrilled with the response. Enter, at this
point, with the clever, merry Weekend Fling, the recently formed Glasgow
North Area Youth Group.
Lisi Perry, who is the assistant artistic director of the SYDF,
recalls how her early conversations with the group about what it's like
to be Scottish, and young, turned to talk of ceilidhs . . . this set
them all thinking about the dance steps, the dance tunes that one
associates with such gatherings. The result is a bright piece of dance
with a distinctly Scottish flavour that is full of fresh energy -- and
some new recruits keen to take part in the festival itself.
That, in a way, sums up so much of what SYDF is about. It's not a
conveyer belt for would-be professionals, although the work schedule
certainly provides useful experience for anyone interested in making
dance their career.
It's really about enjoying dance, exploring dance, and sharing dance.
Those evening performances (tonight and tomorrow at the RSAMD) not only
allow members of the public to catch sight of what's happening in youth
dance across the country. They also allow the participants to show one
another what they have achieved prior to the festival.
It's a way of exchanging ideas and attitudes -- a process which is, of
course, furthered in those creative sessions where new works evolve from
the melting pot of different groups. In previous years the festival has
had to run its various classes in a higgledy-piggledy array of whatever
spaces the host towns could provide. This sometimes meant a hectic
regime of busing and walking between buildings. Glasgow's RSAMD,
however, allows the festival to flourish under one roof with facilities
that have already brought happy grins to the faces of artistic director
Winifred Jamieson and her colleagues.
The feeling is that this festival is shaping up to be the best ever, a
really inspiring mix of participants from different cultures and
countries all of whom are dedicated to the business of dancing their
socks off for the next seven days at least.
Just what their tutors can get up to is revealed in a Triple Bill on
Friday when CandoCo head up a programme of strong works that will not
only entertain but inspire the youngsters who are trying to follow in
the steps.

THE City seems to have forgotten that if #100 had been invested in
Tomkins in 1983 when the Greg Hutchings team came on board, the
investment now would be worth #6000 including re-invested dividends,
whereas the FTSE All-Share market would have shown just #750 on the same
basis, writes ANDREW WILSON.
So in a like frame of mind, the 17.9% increase in pre-tax profits for
last year to #303m was treated with some disdain and the shares eased 5p
to 235p.
Yet Tomkins is proving that the #990m acquisition of the RHM baking
and sauces group is a success earlier than expected by the
transformation of the British baking industry more into a profit-driven
rather than sales-led business.
Operating profits there have risen by 54% to #124m as a result of cost
cutting which has taken 5000 employees out of the group and the current
payroll is 23,000. There is a greater concentration on profitability
rather than market share. So that meant shedding up to #30m of
loss-making baking business which helped spur the major supermarkets to
think again about their own loss-making baking.
The turnround is encouraging thoughts of another major takeover with
Tomkins having net cash of #289m and so the potential of making a cash
bid of at least #600m.
Mr Hutchings yesterday specifically ruled out water and electricity,
property, high technology, and big ticket items but seems keen to move
fairly soon.
The core businesses saw good results in the US from mundane but stable
activities such as air-conditioning and bicycles. America accounted for
51% of profits. Smith &amp; Wesson, the small arms company, is benefiting
from sales of the Sigma polymer handgun but Tomkins is looking to
substantial benefits from mid-cycle industries to boost North Anerican
profits for the next few years.
In contrast, the UK non-foods businesses were fairly unexciting
overall but moving in the right direction.
Current year profits could reach #340m to leave the shares trading at
12.4 times likely earnings. This one full-point discount to the market
seems unfair and buyers of the stock should benefit when sentiment
eventually does change.
While waiting, there is the consolation of an above average yield of
4.6% on the dividend total raised 17.2% to 8.65p.

Keith Bruce reveals the award-winners for outstanding performances at
Glasgow Jazz Festival
ON Thursday night colleague Michael Tumelty was at Glasgow Royal
Concert Hall reviewing one of the greatest divas of our time. I was at
the Old Fruitmarket where trumpeter Arturo Sandoval was leading his band
Latin Train through a percussive frenzy that had a fair section of the
audience dancing, when suddenly the Scottish Organiser of the Musicians'
Union, Ian Smith, was at my elbow.
''Jessye Norman was the short straw tonight,'' he bellowed in my ear.
At the time it was difficult to disagree, but I am confident it is the
one and only time that I will ever hear Jessye Norman described as a
short straw.
The Sandoval concert was doubtless for many a highlight of the jazz
week that has been this year's Glasgow International Jazz Festival, but
such has been the standard of the gigs that it did not warrant a place
on the short list for the first annual TGI Friday's Award for the most
outstanding performance of the festival.
A panel of festival director Derek Gorman, programme co-ordinator
Olive Millen, myself, and -- with the weighty responsibility of
representing the concert-going public -- jazz fan Tom Shearer, were
charged with picking the best of the festival. The murmurs that greeted
our shortlist when it was announced before the Mingus Big Band concert
on Sunday night confirmed that jazz aficionados are unlikely to concur
with any such definition.
In the event, however, that band swept all before them to win an award
we decided to split into two -- best band and best individual
performance. The four of us, who had found plenty to divide us as well
as unite us, were unanimous in giving the thumbs-up to the storming
conclusion to the 1995 festival that the Mingus Big Band provided.
The individual category was another story, with us each backing a
different horse, but when the votes were counted it was Manchester
guitarist Mike Walker who defeated pianists Mulgrew Miller and Brian
Kellock, and trumpeter Gerard Presencer. Thirty-two-year-old Walker was
the star of the opening weekend with his contribution to the Julian
Arguelles Quartet and was also part of this weekend's Europhonium
programme at the Ramshorn Theatre that brought young musicians from
Scotland and the north of England together with visitors from Germany
and Holland.
Walker, who has also played with saxophonist Tommy Smith, trumpeter
Kenny Wheeler, and the big bands of Mike Gibbs and George Russell,
confessed himself suprised by the award and delighted by the festival.
Europhonium, he said, had been a particular pleasure. ''I like playing
in situations where I don't know what is going to happen next,'' he
said. ''It brings out the best in a lot of people.''
The festival itself is also celebrating, having achieved 106% of its
target ticket sales: a total of 11,300 tickets sold, almost 5000 of them
for the festival's core performances at the Old Fruitmarket.
Derek Gorman is pleased that his aim of making the festival more
accessible appeared to have been successful, with people of all ages
moving from venue to venue over the evening and at the weekend.

FISH-and-chip shop group Harry Ramsden's yesterday dished up a 27%
jump in half-year profits, helped by the continuing expansion of its
franchised chain.
The company, based at Guiseley in Leeds, made #129,686 before tax in
the six months to April 2, up from #101,824 in the corresponding period
a year earlier. Turnover was up 11% to #1.55m from #1.39m.
''This growth reflects an increase in the number of restaurants to 14
from 10 at the end of the same period last year and a good performance
from the company-owned Guiseley restaurant,'' said a spokesman.
The interim dividend stays at 1p on earnings per share increased to 1p
from 0.8p.

SARA VILLIERS visits a young-at-heart group who are determined not to
make a drama out of growing old.
CROUCHED on the floorboards of the hall of Parkhead and Calton Parish
Church in Glasgow, Sarah Gallacher picks up invisible jars of jam and
lentils and looks around for some stones suitable for a pair of scales,
recreating the imaginary grocery shop game she played so often in her
childhood. Gallacher is a member of PAGE (Pensioners Action Group East)
who are working with 7:84 to present a specially created production for
the Glasgow Fair Festival at the Ramshorn Theatre, from Friday July
14-16 at 8pm. The show is called Act Your Age but it's by, and about,
the eternally young at heart.
The project revises a collaboration formed last year, when the
pensioners participated in 7:84's successful community show Glasgow
Generations. Then, their segments, alongside those of secondary school
children and young unemployed, included dramatisations of their earliest
memories.
''Now we're acting like kids again,'' smiles Pat Woods, 78, commenting
on the inclusion in this show of similar evocations of the past. The
childhood segments symbolise the youthful spirit which characterises the
group. Jean Stewart shrugs her shoulders when asked her age -- at 66
she's the baby of the cast -- and firmly announces: ''I'll never grow
up''.
The play has been devised through extensive workshops with 7:84's
outreach worker, John Heraghty, who has been working with the group from
PAGE since January, building on the process they began last year by
expanding on skills and exploring character development.
For the past few weeks the group has been meeting daily, joined by
Gillian Robertson, a drama worker from 7:84, production manager William
Maxwell, and designer Evelyn Barbour. This year's show will be the
product of more polished production values and is also an important
example of 7:84's ethos of continuing the drama work they initiated in
communities.
However, while the group agrees that the theatrical experience has
been highly satisfying for them, Heraghty is quick to point out that the
exchange of experience is very much a two-way street. ''We're giving the
group the opportunity to do drama work but they get on with their own
work when we're not here. They don't have a desperate need for us.''
Indeed, it's surprising the PAGE group find the time for rehearsals;
they joke that the demanding schedule ''keeps them out of the house'',
but the truth is that they are all actively involved in community
issues, committing their time to various forums and campaigns. The
redoubtable Bessie MacDonald, 75, a regular face on Scottish
Television's Scottish Women, admits that the only reason she has been
able to fit in the rehearsals is because the Citizens' Advice Forum, of
which she is a representative, is on sabbatical over the summer.
Last week they all travelled through to Edinburgh to lobby the
Scottish Office against the closure of Belvidere Hospital, an experience
which is included in the show. A depiction of the campaigning work they
do on behalf of elderly people in Glasgow is an important part of the
play, and Woods hopes that it will be an entertaining way to get their
message across.
It's certainly not straight-faced agitprop. The group constantly
competes to wind each other up, and the dry humour, so in evidence
during their lunchtime bantering, also informs the text in
self-deprecating scenes, such as a hilarious conversation between a
threesome about the pills they take which escalates into bragging
comparisons and an expose of the temptations of sampling other people's
drugs.
''We hope the play will have a serious impact but there's a humorous
side, too,'' says Jimmy Hanlon, 69, who, like the rest of the cast,
plays himself, but also the narrator, Clarence McDougall, a fictional
character based on a chap who used to stand at Parkhead Cross and watch
the world go by.
''After all, you can't go through life being serious all the time.
That's not my style.'' The hoots and laughs of his colleagues, victims
of Hanlon's constant leg-pulling, confirm the veracity of that remark.

IRN Bru group A G Barr yesterday revealed the scars of soaring
packaging and sugar costs, with interim pre-tax profits falling 19% to
#1.82m, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Although the half-year dividend was maintained at 2p, shares in the
Glasgow-based soft drinks company were trimmed 9p to 364p.
Analysts do not expect Barr to emulate last year's record pre-tax
profits of #6.65m, partly because of the cost of centralising production
at a new site in Cumbernauld.
Most of this #1m-plus cost, relating to an as-yet-undetermined number
of redundancies and the movement of plant from existing operations in
Glasgow, Falkirk and Wishaw, will not be incurred until the next
financial year. However, some charge will be taken in the current 12
months.
Last year's 63% increase in profits was the result of a long hot
summer and chairman Robin Barr hopes the recent spell of excellent
weather will continue during the next crucial few months.
Turnover in the six months to April 29 was 3% higher than the
corresponding period last year.
However, this was offset by the spiralling price of plastic ''PET''
bottles, which cost 50% more than they did a year ago.
Sterling weakness also took its toll on Barr, having led to a 6%
increase in sugar prices in the three months to end-May.
In April, Barr implemented price increases, although these were kept
below 4%.
Sales of Barr brands, which also include Tizer, were up 4%. The
group's offbeat advertising campaign, which features on hoardings and
television, appears to be having some effect in the face of fierce
competition from ''premium'' colas, including Virgin.
Low-margin sales of retailers' own-label brands continued to decline
but turnover was boosted by Barr's takeover, on March 1, of the Orangina
franchise for the UK take-home trade.
Having announced in January that it was centralising production, Barr
purchased the property at Westfield, Cumbernauld, in April and is
upgrading it.
A production line for PET bottles should be up-and-running by the end
of this year, with installation of a line which will fill returnable
bottles scheduled for March.

YOU don't mean? Surely you're not trying to suggest? How could you
imagine that I might wander into a packed theatre in broad daylight and
sit there cynically picking the play apart while the audience looked
happily on beside me? I tell you, inspector, it didn't trouble me one
jot that the set was virtually identical to the one I saw here a
fortnight ago. Why, the second half was even quite enjoyable. I swear on
my Bible that I wasn't sniggering at all at the melodramatic turns of
phrase.
All right, so it's not a Bible, it's my programme, but I thought it
was a Bible. And in any case, are you implying that I might have
deliberately set out to? The very idea is absurd! You've got to believe
me! Surely you must know I cared for the Colin McIntyre Repertory
Players as much as anyone. It's perfectly ludicrous to imagine that I
might have cast doubt on this sturdy Victorian thriller by William
Dinner and William Morum, with its moments of wit, its telling
psychological moral, and its keep-'em-guessing plot line.
Why, there were even times when the four actors, Julia Sheridan,
Nicola Boyce, George Telfer, and Simon McAdam, were able to muster
performances of some passion and depth. Unless . . . You surely can't
believe that I might have guessed very early on that if it wasn't the
first suspect, and if it wasn't the second suspect, and if it wasn't the
police inspector, then it must have been . . . Very well! I confess it!
It was me who did the murder. Yes, yes, yes! I was the critic.

OBAN'S Moleigh Dancers went through the looking glass -- with dramatic
effect -- Grampian's Just Dance cut a dash with fans and Re-spect (from
Nuremberg) strutted so much seriously sexy attitude they cause hormonal
meltdown in the stalls.
The Scottish Youth Dance Festival is surely off to a rousing start.
These evening performances (there's one tonight, another tomorrow) are
essentially platforms for the participants (tutors included), a chance
for them to perform something from their own repertoire in front of
other groups and members of the public -- if they are wise enough to
turn up.
Last night's programme highlighted the range of activity now current
in Scotland and beyond. The Moleigh Dancers, for instance, have members
with special needs. The dance-course students from Dundee college are
about to embark on further training and will probably pursue a career in
dance-making.
And the lads from Nuremberg? Well they served as a reminder that cool
dudes can use dance to create an even cooler image. Dressed in sharp but
casual black and white -- and sporting white plaster ''gauntlets'' a la
Michael Jackson -- this team of guys breenged their way through a crisp
set of street moves, acrobatics and mean, moody poses.
Dramatic in a different way were the Moleigh Dancers with The Image,
where onstage percussion lent an imaginative edge to a surreal clash
with evil that shifted between both sides of a mirror image. Springburn
Youth Group belied their short time together with a really sassy
rendering of Weekend Fling while Bedwas Youth Group (from Gwent) offered
some merry choreographic tic-tac in Up In Arms.
The Dundee students augured well for their future, bringing clean
lines and considerable poise to Crash.
It's not possible to go into the detail of each and every piece
performed but on this showing it looks as if the rest of the festival
will be well worth watching.

CONSIDER this. If capping powers are lifted and councillors go
stir-crazy like lottery winners spending public money, you the voters
will punish them at the ballot box. But you, the same voters, should not
be trusted to pass the same judgment on the budget proposals of a
Scottish Parliament.
That, in essence, seems to be the logic of the policy we can expect
from our new Secretary of State for Scotland in the months ahead. It
seems Michael Forsyth wants to open up local authority funding while
attacking tax-raising power for a Scottish Parliament as he looks for
ways to put Labour on the spot north of the Border in the run-in to a
General Election.
Placing landmines along the road to home rule is all very well, but if
someone doesn't keep an accurate map of where exactly they are laid and
precisely who they are intended to ambush, Mr Forsyth may end up
stepping on one himself.
The first sketches of a policy programme, of which we were given a
glimpse last Friday at the unveiling of the new-look Scottish Office
team, provide us with plenty to ponder over our summer holidays. It is
to be hoped that thereafter we can get on with genuine analysis of
proposals and serious debate about alternatives free from the kind of
personalised invective which marked some of last weeks's press coverage.
Conservatives in Scotland and England are showing clear signs of
anxiety about the print media. North of the Border this has been a
persistent theme for several years as Conservatives lament what they
perceive as an anti-Tory bias in the Scottish press -- a sentiment which
has always foreshadowed a potential bid for a Scottish newspaper if one
comes on the market, such as the Scotsman.
Last week's performance by the Daily Record, where Mr Forsyth was
portrayed as the ''most hated man in Scottish politics'' and caricatured
as a figure from a horror film, will have reinforced this.
But there are new rumblings in London which suggest this is becoming
an issue there too. Former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil wrote in that
newspaper: ''Mr Major will be the first Tory Prime Minister in modern
times to seek to win a General Election without the unanimous and active
support of Fleet Street's finest,'' adding: ''A relatively unbiased Tory
press -- or at least one without malice -- is worth a dozen editorial
endorsements for Labour.''
This has been one of the direct consequences of the leadership
contest, as Lord Archer drew attention to on Sunday. Having lost the
confidence of pro-Thatcherite press barons Murdoch, Rothermere, and
Black by sparking off an election battle, Mr Major faces an uphill
struggle to win back their support.
Meanwhile, the leadership election has delivered to Scotland, the part
of the British political and media landscape most hostile to
Thatcherism, the principal torch-bearer of Thatcherite ideology. If
democracy is meant to deliver the politics that people want, then we
really have passed through to the other side of the looking glass.
Before anyone on either side of the politics-media divide in Scotland
begins to argue too loudly about the rough treatment meted out to Mr
Forsyth last week, they might usefully look back at some of the worst
excesses of Fleet Street and hope earnestly that none of these is
replicated here.
Mr Forsyth should be given a reasonable chance to outline and
propagate his views, some of which are potentially populist and sound.
For example, cutting red tape is hard to gainsay and on Friday new
Education Minister Raymond Robertson, a former teacher, gave a personal
commitment to cutting paperwork.
School sports might be given a nudge in the right direction,
particularly in working-class areas where family support is patchier.
The health service could find itself being given the odd piece of
hi-tech kit that it didn't expect. But then what?
What of the rest of the supposed agenda for change, the radicalisation
of local government that will lead the Scottish electorate to give up
its demand for a Parliament? It is absurd where it isn't contradictory,
and after the novelty has worn off the opposition parties will eat it
alive.
For a Government which has consistently weakened local government
suddenly to decide to strengthen its powers as a buttress against a
Scottish Parliament will be seen as an act of hypocrisy and in any case
it won't wash.
The Labour Party's old house has skeletons rattling in its closets but
Monklands, Renfrew, Kirkcaldy et al have seen action taken which has
changed all that. Labour in Scotland, behind all the genuine good
intentions about creating more informed and better educated councillors,
is now what would in the past have been called a ''tankie''
organisation. That is to say a bastion of democratic centralism.
Which in turn is to say that what Keir Hardie House says, goes. The
notion that Michael Forsyth can hold out a carrot to renegade local
authorities to make them reject a Parliament in Edinburgh is fanciful.
Going from crushing local government to empowering it, from starving it
of funding to loosening its purse strings, these things sound plausible
but will not hold up under scrutiny.
Above all, Tory rhetoric about the ''tartan tax'' will be laid bare if
it is decided to allow council taxes to run amok. Nor is there time. By
next year, when unitary authorities declare their budgets, they will be
able to blame the whole reorganisation process for the increase in
charges, and scapegoat the Government.
Meanwhile, Labour and its Liberal Democrat partner on the Scottish
Constitutional Convention will challenge the Conservatives to stand for
the Scottish Parliament on a low-spending platform, or to back off and
admit they have excluded themselves from the debate.
By that time, enough Scots Tories attracted by the idea of that
Parliament and its proportional representation voting system will have
broken ranks and stood on just such a platform. The Forsyth manifesto,
however ingenious, will have come too late.

THE consolidation of the building society industry went a step further
yesterday with Abbey National agreeing to pay #1350m for National &amp;
Provincial building society. The deal is expected to be earnings
enhancing within a full year, by 1997.
The City thinks that Abbey National may have offered too much and is
disappointed that the deal will not add to earnings until the first full
year and so its shares dropped 12p to 481p.
Both groups emphasised that the deal was good news for everyone --
shareholders, customers, members, and staff. It is particularly good
news for the 10,000 to 15,000 people who opened an N&amp;P account between
April 24, when Abbey National's interest was registered, and April 28
when N&amp;P announced that no new share accounts could be opened.
Under the terms of the deal all 1.3 million eligible N&amp;P saving and
borrowing members with at least #100 in their accounts on 28 April 1995,
will receive a fixed amount of at least #500 in Abbey National shares.
Members qualifying as savers and borrowers will receive a distribution
in both capacities.
Eligible savers of two years standing will also receive a variable
distribution based on their account balance at a date yet to be
finalised. The variable distribution will be available in the form of
cash or shares. Eligible employees and pensioners will also receive the
fixed share distribution with the option to receive cash instead of the
shares.
Abbey National has had its eyes on N&amp;P for years, and Lord Tugendhat,
Abbey's chairman, said the merger was ''the last major piece of the
jigsaw'' in terms of the group's growth strategy. Abbey National was not
the only group interested in N&amp;P.
However, N&amp;P refused to disclose how many other parties had been
interested in a merger or how much they had been willing to pay. In the
end Abbey did agree to pay the most money, increasing its original
#1200m offer.
Lord Tugendhat said the merger of the two organisations would create
''a powerful force in personal financial services'' and that there was
compelling strategic and commercial logic in the deal. There is a good
geographical fit with Abbey's southern customer base complementing N&amp;P's
strenth in northern Britain.
The group will have a combined market share of over 15%, consolidating
Abbey's position as the number two mortgage lender behind the
Halifax/Leeds building society.
With competition as intense as it is in the market, only the larger
players are able to offer a cost-effective extensive range of products.
Six years ago the top six mortgage lenders accounted for 46% of the
market. That market share has since risen to almost 60%
The addition of N&amp;P's three million customers to its existing 12
million will provide Abbey National with an increased base on which to
sell a range of products. Abbey wants to earn 40% of its income from
non-traditional sources by 1997. There are thought to be opportunities
for cost savings of up to #50m per annum, equivalent to around 5% of the
combined cost base, as the merger benefits come through.
As a result of the merger, National &amp; Provincial customers will get
access to cheaper wholesale funds, an additional 550 branches including
branches in more than 400 shopping centres, access to about 1100 cash
machines and a current account.
Up to 120 branches are to close as a result of the merger although
both companies were at pains to emphasise that no community that was
currently served by either of the two busineses would lose out. There
has also been a commitment to no compulsory redundancies among the N&amp;P
branch staff and the number of people employed at N&amp;P's Bradford
headquarters will be at least maintained at around 1400.
Bradford is going to be used as one of the major administration
centres out of which some of the newer activities such as the direct
telephone-based service and general insurance business will be run.
N&amp;P's existing life insurance business will be moving from General
Accident in Edinburgh to Scottish Mutual in Glasgow. In addition, the
Bradford site will be one of three national training centres.
The merger is subject to approval from the Building Societies'
Association and N&amp;P members. The ballot is likely to take place sometime
next year. Commenting on the proposed merger, Ken Culley, chairman of
the BSA, said that it was essential that the legislative restriction on
payouts to investors of less than two years standing should be enforced.
''It is wrong that short-term investors should be able to get something
for nothing without having made a contribution to the society over a
number of years.''
He added that the two-year rule had been written to prevent
speculative flows of funds destabilising the building society industry.
However, this it is patently failing to do. People are already looking
for where to put their #100 in order to benefit from the next merger.
My money is on the Alliance &amp; Leicester, a medium-size player with
4.1% of the mortgage market but it is too small to be truly competitive.
It is believed to have bid for N&amp;P which suggests that it is aware of
the need to become a bigger player in personal financial services.

T&amp;N chairman Colin Hope seems certain to appeal against a German
Federal Cartel Office bid to block its #125m acquisition of
Kolbenschmidt, Germany's second-largest piston manufacturer.
Mr Hope has until August 7 to appeal.
The Berlin-based Cartel Office objected on the grounds that the
acquisition would give T&amp;N share of more than 60% of the market for
piston rings in Germany as well more than 60% of the market for steel
and plastic slide bearings.
But T&amp;N is likely to argue that European component sourcing is
international and that it has the support of several major car
manufacturers.
There has been some surprise among German engineering companies how
successful the Birmingham-based group has been in gaining market share
in what has traditionally been a fairly closed market as far as
outsiders are concerned.

LOW &amp; Bonar shares fell 19p to 510p on profit-taking after the
Dundee-based packaging materials group reported a 22% increase in
interim pre-tax profit to #24.8m. Adverse currency movements reduced
first-half sales and profits by 1%.
Sales in continuing businesses were 13% higher. The interim dividend
is raised by 12% to 3.6p.
The results were in line with City expectations and were particularly
good given the sharp rise in raw material prices during the period.
Group chief executive Jim Leng said there were signs that some of the
raw material prices, such as plastic, were stabilising. In North
America, the company is seeing some price reductions. All divisions
contributed to the improved trading performace with the North American
business moving up from 7.8% to 10.5%.
Elsewhere in the group, margins in the European business moved ahead
from 11.9% to 12.2%. Demand improved in packaging and there was strong
growth in sales and profits in European Plastics with the business
benefiting from previous cost-cutting exercises. Although there was
lower demand in the UK for its specialist materials margins were held
and there was strong growth on the Continent.
Productivity within the group has been rising steadily. In three
years, the sales per employee has risen by #100m with 8% less staff.
Capital expenditure in the first half was #10m with investment almost
across the board.
The company has a strong balance sheet with no gearing and remains on
the lookout for in-fill acquisitions.
However, there is still thought to be scope to improve margins in 30%
of the existing business, principally in North America. In terms of the
outlook, Mr Leng said the group was realistic about the challenging
trading environment but was in better shape than most of its
competitors.

ALTHOUGH the producer prices data for June produced no great
surprises, financial markets took the view that, on balance,
inflationary pressures would strengthen the Governor of the Bank of
England's hand in his belief that interest rates should be lifted
despite the recent softening seen in the US, Japan and France and
suggestions that the Bundesbank could make a reduction this Thursday.
The increase in the headline output (factory gate) price index for
home sales of manufactured goods over 12 months was 4.2%, unchanged from
the May figure with just a 0.1% increase over the month and below
expectations for a 4.4% increase.
However, ''core'' factory gate inflation, excluding food, beverages,
tobacco, and petroleum, which leads core retail prices by six to nine
months, accelerated 0.3% over the month lifting the annual rate to 4.8%
in June compared to May's 4.6%, itself revised up from 4.5%. This is the
highest annual rate of increase since May 1991, when it stood at 5.2%.
The rate of increase in industry's raw material costs -- producer
input as opposed to output prices -- continued to decelerate, rising by
10.2% in the year to June, down from 10.8% in the 12 months to May. But
while this is well below January's peak of 12.1% it was still above
market projections of a slowdown to around 8.8%.
So far as the core output prices are concerned, these are likely to
increase the disagreement between the Governor of the Bank of England
and the Chancellor of the Exchequer who resisted the Governor's call for
an interest rate increase at their meeting in May and is also believed
to have done so in June and July.
The Chancellor could, of course, have a change of heart as data
unfolds which perhaps give support to the Governor's view but analysts
consider that nothing is likely to happen before the autumn. The
Governor, though, said last week that the UK was less likely to hit its
inflation aim. The official target is for retail price inflation,
excluding mortgage interest payments, of 2.5% or lower by the spring of
1997 and beyond.
Meanwhile, as a consequence of the current increase in produce output
prices, underlying inflation is thought likely to rise towards 4% in
early 1996, with a risk that it breaches the top of the Government's
broader 1%-4% target range around the middle of next year unless
monetary policy is tightened further.
The rise in underlying factory gate prices is, therefore, regarded as
a cause for concern but the continued strength of input prices and
upward revisions to back data are also worrying though in the
longer-term recent falls in global commodity prices would be expected to
start feeding through.
James Capel's Adam Cole warns that with capacity utilisation high, and
input and import prices surging, factory gate inflation is set to rise
further later this year.
Looking at the different sectors, inflationary pressure is most
pronounced in the early cyclical sectors. Pulp, paper and paper product
prices -- a sector previously identified by Capel as a leading indicator
of more general price pressures -- are rising at almost 20%
year-on-year. And price pressures in basic metals, chemicals, and
electrical equipment also remain strong.
The UK visible trade deficit for April, also released yesterday, grew
to #1411m from #520m in March, considerably greater than market
projections which had centred on around #800m.
The Central Statistical Office was quick to point out that
three-quarters of the increase in the deficit can be attributed to
erratics, in particular lower exports of precious stones and higher
purchases of foreign-built aircraft and the importation of the cruise
ship Oriana which added #300m to the import bill.
The underlying trade deficit, excluding oil and erratic items, widened
much less sharply to #1433m from #1266m.
In the three months to April, the estimates show the visible deficit
decreasing from #3000m in the previous three months to #2600m. Excluding
oil and erratics, the deficit was virtually unchanged between the two
periods.
The CSO makes the point that the pattern of the visible trade deficit
over the last few months has been erratic, making estimation of the
trend particularly difficult. Bearing this in mind, the latest estimate
suggests that the trend in the whole world visible deficit is fairly
flat.

IN Italy, where they now possess a rowdy cynicism for almost anyone in
public life, politics is usually regarded as the last refuge of the
mediocre. So there was little dejection or sense of betrayal last
weekend when a Venetian court sentenced a former Foreign Minister to
four years in jail for corruption. Here was just one more outbreak of
the judiciary's avenging forest fire which has raged through the country
since 1992, routing out finagling politicians, financiers,
industrialists, and Cosa Nostra bosses.
But the purge has been so profound the whole structure of governance
is caving in on itself and may yet cripple the very attempt to put the
country in good order. Gianni De Michelis, meanwhile, may be confident
that the labyrinthian process of appeal will ensure the jailer's lock
and key doesn't turn against him.
After all, in such matters he has been schooled by masters, two
ex-Prime Ministers in fact: Giulio Andreotti now effectively playing the
frail septuagenarian to fend off his various trials, and Bettino Craxi
who has transformed disgrace into fugitive's glamour by exiling himself
to a Tunisian resort. De Michelis, built like a bouncer, his long hair
worn loose or pulled back into a pigtail, was always a man contemptuous
of rectitude during his years of office from 1990 to 92. Here was the
spiv of international summits, impatient to be rid of debate and
communiques so that he could resume his disco-fever of the night before.
The court in Venice found him guilty of violating Socialist Party
financing by accepting bribes of around #500,000. De Michelis denied all
charges. As a former deputy leader of the socialists he is still
enmeshed in further probes about illicit funds but last year he was
cleared in one case when a Milan court ruled he could not be convicted
because the promised kickbacks at the heart of that particular scandal
had not been handed over.
Running parallel to all this there is the alleged chicanery which
cloaks Italian style, a charge that in September will demand the
appearance in court of some of the world's most distinguished fashion
designers. The allegations have already been well aired in the media,
with several of the biggest names -- Armani, Ferre, and Mariucca
Mandelli of Krizia admitting they had given money to tax officials in
return for lenient treatment. In each case, however, the designers
claimed to be the victims of extortion, and among them is Santo Versace,
brother of Gianni and business chief of the family fashion house.
Milan's Fashiongate prompts the same question posed by many bribery
scandals: were those involved really trapped in a widespread protection
racket which left them no alternative but to pay up or be ruined? Or
were they willing accomplices in a routine malpractice which would
benefit them enormously? Fashion is an immensely important industry in
Italy, employing more than one million people and averaging a turnover
of $44bn, 13% of which is drawn from exports. In Ferre's case, the
global turnover is around $573m. The Armani figure is about $545m and
Krizia's, $439m.
But now Italy faces a more difficult problem: knowing when to call a
halt to investigations and how to rein in over-zealous magistrates who
may be pursuing personal or political vendettas. Concealed within an
elegant, enigmatic code of charm and manners, much of Italian life has
always been anarchic, and it has long been accepted that even decent
people, somewhere along the line, will have paid a bribe to get work
done. Who knows how many of the country's 56 million inhabitants would
stay out of jail if everyone were to be sent down for paying off a tax
inspector?
However the sinister cronyism and fraud, first discovered two years
ago, has exposed a treachery far beyond acceptable levels of corruption.
Along with key politicians, titans of business have fallen and some,
with their squalid apparatchiks, are now implicated with the Mafia.
''The Mafia controls everything,'' says Nando Magnini, a university
lecturer. ''Previously we never felt able to challenge it but now that
communism is dead so too is the political system designed to oppose it.
Only so far we have no adequate replacement.'' But those who cry enough
urge the prosecutors to allow Italy's stumbling new political class to
embark on work which, however badly begun, must finish well and
honestly. The alternative, they argue, is economic and social paralysis.
And so it happens that Antonio di Pietro, the hero magistrate once
hailed as the people's guardian angel, is now demonised and placed under
investigation for abuse of office. Call it the poetic justice of a
lawless land, call it crude revenge, some Italians might not be joking
when they tell you that to make an appointment with a judge these days
you must turn towards a prison.

THREE remarkable things have come to light in the Highlands, and in
particular the policies of the Highland Health Board. First, the board
seriously proposed to install condom-vending machines in secondary
schools, and to this end recently commissioned an opinion poll of
parents. Their answers are most convenient.
Secondly, the Highland Health Board is to fund a branch of the Brook
Advisory Centre in Inverness, the first arrival in the north of that
noted no-questions-asked donor of contraceptives. Start-up funding, we
gather, will cost Highland council tax payers some #20,000; the annual
costs will average #40,000.
And, thirdly, the Highland Health Board has refused to give any
funding whatsoever to the Inverness Crisis Pregnancy Centre, a voluntary
organisation run by local Christians and which seeks to help young women
in trouble without recourse to abortion. Nor to Lifeline, a similar
outfit run by Roman Catholics.
What makes all this very remarkable indeed is that the Highlands boast
lower rates of teenage pregnancy, illegitimacy, venereal disease, and
Aids infection than the Scottish average. If it ain't broke, why fix it?
Enter the irrepressible Caroline Thomson, a 42-year-old London-born
wifie who is the vice-chairman of the Highland Health Board. She
commissioned a survey of parental attitudes by Strathclyde University's
Centre for Social Marketing. A questionnaire, remarkable both for its
obsession with condoms and spectacular leading questions -- what can you
do but agree to ''It is worth making condoms available to young people
if it stops one girl getting pregnant''? -- was sent to 1200 parents of
teenagers on the Highland school roll.
Many must have been highly offended: the survey dealt in matters one
would hesitate to discuss with one's doctor. Two reminders had to be
sent before 816 parents finally responded. And Thomson and her
colleagues seized delightedly on the finding that a majority agreed
condom-vending machines should be placed in all senior school toilets.
The local press, duly fed the line, happily played it. Few bothered to
note that the majority was a bare 51% for the proposal, with 49%
against. If 16 folk had changed their minds, the position would be
reversed.
Mrs Thomson has crusaded for this since 1993. ''We have a
responsibility and a part to play in reducing teenage pregnancy. We
cannot hide our heads in the sand and fail these young people.'' She
insists the survey is academically bombproof, and does not hide her
contempt for those who disagree with her. And she calls on the local
education committee, meeting in August, to action her demands.
This woman seems unable to see an intolerance in herself she so
stridently pins on others. ''We cannot allow a minority, whoever they
represent, to set our strategic direction,'' Caroline Thomson declares.
''This commonsense response is much more useful in directing policy than
the often unfounded remarks of the self-appointed guardians of public
morality.'' Yet what, may we ask, is she, but such a self-appointed
guardian?
And why, when a friend went to the HHB to ask for the copy of its
survey now lying beside me, did she have such difficulty in getting it?
They wanted to know if she was a journalist. They then wanted to know
who she was and why she wanted it. She said, smiling sweetly, that she
was a parent; she might have added that they had produced this rubbish
on her money.
Something has gone very wrong in the HHB. In 1993 it wanted the same
facilities in schools -- but to fight Aids, not unwanted pregnancy. A
small, extreme, self-righteous cadre is in command in Inverness, and
determined to pursue policies in a field which can be none of the health
board's concern; policies which, being made known, would shock very many
Highland parents.
Mrs Thomson has two pals to play with. One is Brian Devlin, an
ex-priest, sometime of Scottish Aids Monitor, sometime Aids Liaison
Officer for the HHB, now its public relations man. (Nice work if you can
get it.) Mr Devlin is notoriously hard to pin down in debate. My friend
describes him expressively as ''terribly nice, terribly dangerous, and
terribly yuck''.
And then there is Dr Stone, general manager of the HHB, he who would
give us Brook but refuses to spare a penny for the Crisis Pregnancy
Centre (nor, indeed, for the Roman Catholice Lifeline). This is because
Dr Stone thinks he is ''non-judgmental''. Indeed, he is very proud of
being non-judgmental, as two local ministers found in a recent Moray
Firth Radio debate.
''We're not in the position of making moral judgments here, we're
taking a strictly non-judgmental view. It is not the board's role to
make a judgment on any moral basis in this regard. Morality is, in my
view anyway, the problem of the church, of the family, and of other
people . . .'' etc, etc. But Dr Stone and his mates, if you pardon the
pun, are taking a moral stand. They wish to enable -- and, indeed, will
surely encourage -- sexual immorality. On our money.
A few home truths these quaint characters should remember.
First, any teenager of normal intelligence who decides to enter a
sexual relationship has access to contraception across the Highlands and
Islands. Are there no chemists? Are there no doctors? Why, suddenly, are
we to supply their needs in publicly funded schools? Do we seriously
expect them to do it in the classroom?
Secondly, it is against the law, and a serious offence, for anyone to
have sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16. (Or, indeed,
for two Scottish youths to bugger each other under the age of 21.) Yet
Caroline Thomson's survey polled parents of children in first to fourth
year. And, if her proposal is carried, Highland Regional Council schools
will tacitly invite children to break the law.
Thirdly, condoms are unreliable. I would not trust one to prevent
pregnancy, far less to block HIV. Their use requires a measure of skill.
They are very easily damaged. How on earth do we expect children, in the
blundering heat of a first fumble, to use them properly?
Fourthly: pregnancies, or disease, are not caused by not using barrier
contraception. They are wrought by sexual intercourse. The best advice
to give to teenagers regarding sex is to postpone it. The best advice of
all is to keep it for lifelong and faithful marriage.
Want more? In their 1980 study of teenage sexual activity, Zelnik and
Kantner ''found that the pregnancy rates for sexually active females
between the ages of 15 and 19 increased when their sexual activity
increased, even when contraceptives were used regularly. The failure
rates of contraceptives and the risk-taking propensities of this age
group are notorious. The provision of contraceptives and education
regarding their use actually encourages recruitment to the pool of
sexually active teenagers . . . Dawson reaches the same conclusion:
'Prior contraceptive education increases the odds of starting
intercourse (at the age of 14) by a factor of 1.5'.''
I quote Dr Gregory Gardner in the March 1995 edition of that notorious
fundamentalist rag, the British Journal of General Practice.
These proposals insult Highland parents, insult all under the care of
the Highland Health Board, and above all insult our teenagers. I shall
watch the education committee debate in August with keen interest. And I
will keep a very cold eye on the Highland Health Board and its three
wise owls.

IT is good to see that Sir Fitzroy Maclean is taking things easier
these days. As a lad he was kept quite busy setting up the SAS regiment
and helping Tito free Yugoslavia from Hitler's jackboot.
Later in life he became Conservative MP for Bute and North Ayrshire
and was a junior minister at the War Office. Then he retired to Argyll
to live in Strachur and help run the Creggans Inn, the family's upmarket
B&amp;B.
At the age of 84 he is leading a quiet life. If you don't count his
new book which comes out soon. It is called Highlanders and is his story
of the Scottish clans. The clan system ''took a bit of a knock at
Culloden'' but is now in very good shape, he says.
Sir Fitzroy has also been working as consultant to a documentary by
Grampian TV, also called Highlanders, which will be screened on ITV
later this month. He is recently returned from tramping the hills and
mountains of Tibet for a travel book on Central Asia.
Being a soldier he filled his rucksack for the trip to Tibet with
vodka and anchovy paste. Well it can get damned cold in Lhasa.
After the Asian travel book, Sir Fitzroy has just one other tome,
subject as yet unspecified, to polish off before he can settle down to
write his memoirs.
Us chaps at the Diary can only aspire to such industry.
Pirate flags
AMID all the jubilation at Ibrox Park as Paul Gascoigne signed for
Rangers there was a touch of consternation. The troubled person was none
other than Mel Stein, Gascoigne's business manager.
Mr Stein surveyed the mass of Rangers fan, many of them waving
suitably coloured flags bearing the name Gazza. ''Who authorised this?''
he demanded of the Rangers officials. ''Who is selling these flags?'' He
pointed out that Gazza is a registered name.
We fear Mr Stein may have a surprise waiting for him when the full
range of entirely unofficial Gazza merchandise is unveiled by the
entrepreneurial street vendors who follow Rangers matches.
Joust joking
THE entry into the Monklands Mafia controversy by the Knights of St
Columba, the Catholic men's organisation who are not at all secret,
prompts the following story from a Mr Jim Baer of Lenzie which may or
may not be apocryphal.
The scene is a hostelry somewhere in the aforementioned bailiwick of
Monklands. The weather is appalling and a local enters with the rain
running out of him, as they say.
''Filthy night,'' he remarks to the only other customer in the pub.
''Masonic bastard,'' is the immediate reply.
One man's meat . . .
WE do enjoy the ingenuity of New York artist Otto Berchem who is
currently doing art in Edinburgh. You may recall his oeuvre last year --
an installation in the gents' toilet at the Ross bandstand in Princes
Street gardens. It raised the issue of surreptitious willy-watching.
Otto's work of art was actually removed before its allotted time after
complaints and because Edinburgh parks department felt it might
compromise their chance of winning Loo of the Year.
But that was then and this is now. Otto is currently featuring at the
Collective Gallery in Cockburn Street, Edinburgh. One of his works is
called Boys will be Boys which consists of two videos. The first,
entitled Hand Catching Spanish Sausage is ''based on Richard Serra's
film Hand Catching Lead, depicting Berchem engaging in a critical and
humorous dialogue with Serra's Wagnerian machismo by catching a sausage,
rather than a block of lead.'' (Got that?)
The second video, entitled Ear Catching Dutch Sausage is, as you may
have guessed, a video of a Dutch sausage flying into an ear. See Otto?
See pushing onwards through the boundaries of artistic achievement?
The Name Game
WE are in receipt of numerous news releases telling us of the many
wonderful shows upcoming at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Most of which
go unread. But how could we ignore a missive from a company called Duff
Publicity.
Their information actually isn't so bad. One of their clients is a
show called Girls with Big Jests which is on at the Gilded Balloon. The
blurb asks: ''Have you ever thought how a Barbie doll really feels?'' We
have no answer to that. Henrietta Garden, creator of the show, has
another claim to fame. She appeared in a Head &amp; Shoulders commercial.
Another Duff client, Fred Macaulay, is also on at the Gilded Balloon.
Fred has never been in a Head &amp; Shoulders advert, being a wee bit on the
baldy side. His show is appropriately called Fred Macaulay Is Unfringed.
Dawn of new era?
GLASGOW, that entertainment capital best known for its curfews and
making sure everyone is home in bed early, is set to become the city
that never sleeps. Well, one small part of it is.
A new venture called Cafe Insomnia in Woodlands Road, near Charing
Cross, is offering food and drink 24 hours a day. Those familiar with
the vagaries of the Glasgow licensing board will have guessed already
that the alcoholic drink does not flow all day.
The situation is that customers can take in their own wine or beer or
buy it from the deli which is attached to Cafe Insomnia. The bad news is
that Crispin, the chap who has launched the venture, does not yet know
how flexible the licensing people will be.
The good news is that Insomnia is the kind of cheap, cheerful, and
laid-back place to delight bohemians of all ages. The limited menu is
cheap but delicious, from chicken Caesar salads, green stuff with dauds
of alfalfa, through to cassoulets and huge platters of cheese, pastrami,
Parma ham or anything you fancy from the deli. The prices are low (from
#2.50 to #4.95) apart from the #2 corkage on a bottle of wine.
The original concept of the premises is as an art gallery with food.
The works on the wall are currently gleaned from recent graduates of
Glasgow School of Art.

As the Royal Bank of Scotland offers a breath of fresh employment with
its new Greenock mortgage centre, Geraldine Abrahams looks at what kind
of jobs will be on offer, and at how a skilled workforce will be trained
NEXT month the new Royal Bank of Scotland Mortgage Centre will become
operational in its greenfield site on the banks of the Clyde, giving the
Greenock area a huge employment boost.
About 100 jobs will be created initially, building up to around 400
over the next two years.
At the moment, there are 50 project workers already in place designing
the operation and enjoying the marvellous views which the new building
offers. Eve Forbes, assistant director in charge of operations, will
supervise them until the end of the year, helping staff to adjust to
their new business roles.
Until now, mortgages have been administered in the branch network and
the accounts held in Edinburgh, but there has been growing support
within the bank for centralisation of the mortgage business.
The new centre has a state-of-the-art software package which is
customised to meet its needs and which is linked to the system in
Edinburgh. This means that speed and efficiency are not penalised by the
centre's picturesque setting.
There are various ways of securing a Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage.
All 750 UK branches of the bank are sales outlets, as are telephone
mortgage services. Whatever delivery channel a customer uses, from
August the processing work will be carried out at Greenock, guaranteeing
a uniform service nationwide.
The mortgage centre will have four departments: new business,
securities, administration and arrears, each with support functions.
The new business team will have 80-100 people and will deal from start
to finish with the verification of applications through to the release
of funds.
Another aspect of the work is queries about mortgages from existing
holders. There are three points of contact for this type of information
-- the regionally-based direct banking facility which deals with
telephone enquiries, the local branch, or direct calls to the Mortgage
Centre at Greenock, where a team of people are employed to provide
answers. In the case of arrears, there will be a unit specifically
designed to deal with the problems.
What does all that mean in terms of the type of jobs on offer at
Greenock?
When the centre is fully operational, there will be a wide variety of
job opportunities, from relatively unskilled/mono-skilled to fairly
highly-skilled.
The distribution of mail, for example is not a difficult task but,
with 5000 items of mail coming in daily, it is crucial. On the other
hand there will be people underwriting new business, which is a very
skilled job.
There will be customer service staff, and, given the centre's
remoteness from the sales outlets, telephone skills will be very
important.
''The people working in here will be customer-facing in the sense that
everybody who phones will be a customer, not necessarily just the
applicant,'' says Stewart Gibson, who is responsible for human resources
at Greenock.
''We are very keen here that the level of customer service is very
high because that is the cornerstone of how things will work. One of the
other key skills will be team working, because we are determined to
establish an environment of mutual support. This is crucial, given the
volatility of the mortgage industry.''
The bank is working with Renfrewshire Enterprise, Search Recruitment
Consultancy, Employment Services and local training providers to recruit
staff, and advertisements have already appeared in the main West of
Scotland press as well as the local press.
There are two types of advertisement running at the moment, one to set
up a pool of mortgage trainees and the other to establish a pool of
mortgage expertise.
Stewart Gibson says: ''When we design jobs, we identify what the key
competencies are, and then we transfer those competencies into the key
behaviour that people would have to demonstrate to perform the job well.
''When we are selecting people, we examine key behaviours to try to
detect whether they would be suitable for the roles for which they are
applying.''
The key competencies would include technical and professional
knowledge, customer orientation and the ability to work in a team. The
ability to gather information and achieve results would also be
important.
At trainee level, the criteria are slightly different. Graduates,
college-leavers or school-leavers would be eligible. So too would be
people who have not worked in a business environment before or perhaps
those who have been unemployed or taken a career break to have a family.
The key is people with potential, who are enthusiastic and have the
right attitude and learning skills. All new starts at Greenock will be
given intensive in-house training.
In conjunction with Renfrewshire Enterprise, the bank has designed a
foundations skills programme which will ease access to jobs. The
programme will include the basic business skills needed to work at the
centre.
It is a customised training course and includes telephone skills,
customer service skills, team-working skills, interview skills,
assertiveness skills, and basic personal computer skills. Training takes
two weeks, and performance will be assessed against SCOTVEC standards.
The centre is also involved with SCOTVEC in designing a module for
mortgage administration at SVQ level 2. Further discussions are also
taking place with some of the local FE colleges over running an HND in
mortgage administration.
''I would envisage people accessing that kind of educational training
by October this year through further and higher educational institutions
which have indicated that, with a similarity to HND in Financial
Services, the training and expertise are in place and will only require
slight tailoring,'' says Stewart Gibson.
The Institute of Bankers in Scotland also has a certificate in
financial services.
''Our main desire is to establish a centre of excellence at Greenock
that is based on sound training that we provide,'' says Stewart Gibson.
''We are here because this is an enterprise zone.
''There were incentives in coming here and we want to make sure the
local population has a fair oppportunity, and can access jobs at the
bank. We have to design training to allow that to happen.''

The Scottish Connection: Margaret Vaughan looks at the building of the
Thomson empire and the decision to sell the newspaper which was its
foundation
ON the drizzly morning of September 2, 1953, a man wearing a Crombie
coat and pebble glasses climbed aboard a tram and paid his sixpenny fare
for a top-deck view of Edinburgh. It was the characteristically frugal
beginnings of Roy Thomson's long journey around British journalism.
A day later the myopic Canadian millionaire was concluding a deal that
would buy him prestige and, eventually, a big slice of British newspaper
history. His short-sightedness did not extend to business dealings, and
his purchase of the austere Scotsman newspaper gave this pawkily
tight-fisted entrepreneur a launching pad for his assault on a fusty
business establishment that, frankly my dears, had thought him little
more than a jumped-up colonial.
The North American business this canny son of a drink-sodden barber
with shaky hands and Scottish roots left behind was bigger than the
Scotsman group and more profitable. But the newspaper and its associated
titles was infinitely more prestigious.
He went on to buy the Times, unashamedly pursue a hereditary peerage,
gain -- in his own words -- a licence to print money by winning the
franchise for the fledgling STV commercial television station, joined a
North Sea oil consortium and struck a fortune, founded a package-holiday
business, a raft of book and magazine publishing companies . . .
But it was the Scotsman, and Scotland, that were at the heart of his
activity for the next 20 years.
Yesterday, the inheritors of Lord Thomson of Fleet signalled their
intention to sever the last link. It may have been his daddy's first
buy, a nostalgic link with the foundations of the empire, but despite
all the gush of commentators, sentiment cuts no ice in the glacial world
of transglobal finance. The Thomson Organisation of Canada has hung a
For Sale sign on the Scotsman. Along with its Scottish stablemates, the
Edinburgh Evening News, Scotland on Sunday, and Aberdeen Journals, it is
now on the market.
It is part of the strategy which saw the sale of Thomson's interests
in regional English newspapers to Trinity International Holdings plc for
#327m, subject to a review by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The separate sale of the Scottish titles underlines their value: last
year they contributed around #10m to Thomson Corporation's coffers in
New York. The Aberdeen-based titles are seen within the organisation as
a ''cash cow'': low costs, high profit. It was being indicated yesterday
that an asking price of about #300m would not be unrealistic for the
Scottish titles.
But if there was concern and fear of the unknown among the staff of
the newspapers yesterday, there were in truth no glistening tears at the
loss of a management which has been at the forefront of introducing such
concepts as ''downsizing'', meaning job losses, ''rationalisation'',
meaning job losses,  and ''ongoing operating efficiency'', meaning job
losses.
''Look, it doesn't really matter who buys us -- we're so lean you can
see the bones. All the fat's long gone. As a newspaper we're practically
anorexic,'' an insider said. ''Frankly, all that remains now of the Roy
Thomson legacy in Scotland is his parsimony.''
The managerial track record of the Thomson organisation in Scotland,
to be charitable, has been mixed: ''Over the past 10 years, the Scotsman
has suffered interference by quite mediocre managerial people. There was
a loss of proprietorial protection for the paper after Roy Thomson died.
I think there was a running battle to preserve its distinctive status
as an independent voice, but eventually it was sucked into the centre,
and despite the best efforts of many on the editorial side, it has
suffered through that,'' said a former senior executive.
After a series of crippling strikes in the late seventies and the
eighties, and in the aftermath of the Wapping revolution led by Rupert
Murdoch, a new ''in-your-face'' managerial strategy was adopted which
led to mass sackings, resignations and rationalisation. Salaries and
staffing levels at the newspaper are now lower than in other comparable
titles.
Former Scotsman editor Magnus Linklater is hoping against hope that an
independent Scottish buyer, or consortium, will come forward to buy the
paper: ''The Scotsman has been an independent voice for Scotland for
more than 175 years. It is vital that it remains as such. I just hope
the Thomson organisation recalls that it was the first paper the late
Lord Thomson bought when he came to Britain and that they will ensure
that whoever the purchaser is, it will be somebody who has the interests
of the paper at heart and will guarantee its independent existence in
Scotland.''
It is a great opportunity to return the newspaper to Scottish hands:
''I hope that the money can be found in Scotland.''  He pointed out that
there had been two previous bids for the newspaper from Scottish
institutions. On both occasions the Thomson organisation had refused to
sell. It would, he believed, be disastrous if the paper fell into the
hands of a group with political intent: ''Anybody trying to buy this
newspaper or any national newspaper for purely political ends is going
to be fatal for the newspaper's interests.  It is vital that it remains
independent of political parties.''
The Scotsman was born in indignation at the ''unblushing
subserviency'' of local newspapers to the Establishment, with an
astringent and independent voice from its launch as a weekly paper of
liberal ideals on  January 25, 1817.
Fife-born solicitor William Ritchie and customs official Charles
Maclaren established the eight-page quarto journal paper with a pledge
to ''impartiality, firmness and independence'' and a circulation of 300
copies.
City newspapers had refused to print, even as an advertisement, an
expose written by Ritchie on mismanagement of the Royal Infirmary.
Soon, the paper began to publish twice weekly, a declared enemy of
privilege and corruption.
The earnest Maclaren became the paper's only editor to fight a duel,
stung by journalistic attacks from the rival Caledonian Mercury's
editor. The two exchanged shots but missed and parted without apology.
The paper went daily with the abolition of newspaper stamp duty in
1855.    It retained a sensitivity to the climate of Scottish opinion
through two world wars and helped in the creation of the post-war plans
for an international arts festival, as well as famously leading the
devolution debate in the seventies.
When, on September 3, 1953, Roy Thomson took it over, he poured
much-needed money into the company, reorganised management and pledged
no interference with editorial control. Which is precisely what it's
hoped the new proprietors, whoever they may be, might offer to a
fiercely proud newspaper.

* Olivia Reynolds's A Positive Guide to Mental Health would probably
score 10 out of 10 for its visual appeal to young people. And people in
the 16-to-25 age band are exactly who the 23-year-old art student is
aiming to attract as mental illnesses often begin to occur during the
turbulent teenage years.
The cover has expressions used to describe people suffering from a
mental illness: crackpot, screwball, gaga, barmy . . .
Some people have been shocked at this bold and frank approach to what
has always been viewed as a sensitive subject. Others say it is a much
needed breath of fresh air in the normally bland world of mental health
publicity.
But the new leaflet, launched last month at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art
Gallery, came about as a result of Olivia Reynolds's own experience with
mental illness. At the age of 20, after three stays in psychiatric
hospitals and an attempted suicide, she was diagnosed as a manic
depressive.
''I was one of the lucky ones,'' says Olivia. ''After I was diagnosed
and later joined the Manic Depression Fellowship in Glasgow I discovered
that there were some people who had suffered this illness for years
without knowing what was wrong with them -- sometimes because medical
staff had decided they shouldn't be told.''
In less than a month A Positive Guide To Mental Health -- financed by
a generous grant from Strathclyde Region's Social Work Department -- has
already exhausted its initial print run. Copies of the leaflet have gone
out to schools, health centres, and individuals all over Scotland.

What are words worth? A great deal if they're out of context, finds
ANDREW POPPLE
WE'VE had some bother with words in our household lately. Or, rather,
with what they mean. I am usually the one with foot-in-mouth disease,
but this time it started with my wife announcing to a gathering that we
were going to the nature reserve Open Day to do some skinnydipping.
It was just a few weeks after Easter -- long before the warmer weather
arrived. To incredulous looks, I denied it and shrank away, rather
literally. She meant, of course, pond dipping, but the word stuck. I can
visualise my son in years to come, holidaying with friends, mistaking
the meaning of an invitation and getting his net out.
The episode reminded me of a most embarrassing thing I did, at age
about 10, to the word ''precipice'' which resulted in my parents rolling
around helpless with laughter. They dined out on that one, at my
expense, for some years. I still cringe with shame at the thought of my
inadvertent -- and unprintable -- error. But it was the product of
trying out new words, trying to find what they sound like and what you
can do with each of the syllables.
Many of the best spoonerisms and malapropisms get their humour,
unfortunately, precisely because they are said by someone who does not
know any different, or is ignorant of their meaning. So all too often
the laughter is at the expense of the poor unfortunate perpetrator.
''Innocent'' examples can be explained, and this eases the personal
focus of the laughter, but the funniest usually involve risque, or just
plain rude, connotations. These cannot be spelt out so easily to young
children, so the feeling of being laughed at, rather than with, may
remain, unless it is carefully explained away. It is important to do it,
or you risk the sort of hang-up I got over ''precipice''.
Many good spoonerisms are funny (or rude, and these do not necessarily
go together) because of what happens when you reverse them, if you see
what I mean. Children, not aware of the reverse, will use them quite
innocently. In a TV tribute to Kenny Everett my daughter saw his
larger-than-life female character -- Cupid Stunt. On a simple level it's
the sort of character that can appeal to kids. She likes the name Cupid:
what if she wants to call a dolly after the character? She's going to
have an awful lot of ''better names'' suggested if the idea surfaces.
All of them in The Best Possible Taste.
Most kids like to experiment with words, playing on similar sounds,
using words deliberately wrongly to see what reaction they get. It's
just that like all experiments, sometimes you get unexpected results.
And occasionally the mixed-up words get stuck. A girl I knew a long time
ago referred to divided roads as Jewish Caraways. She just couldn't say
it any other way.
A nice -- also true -- example of troublesome words happened recently
to friends. The youngest of their several children came up with ''Mum,
what's a virgin?'' Instantly recognising the signs that a bit of sex
education is in order here, even though he is quite young for such
questions, she launches in full tilt. After all, she's had some
practice. After a short while young lad starts fidgetting: ''Sit still
this is important.'' ''But Mum . . .''  ''Be quiet and listen.'' Lad
shrugs and sits there. At the end of a comprehensive exposition, our
friends asks: ''Did you understand -- have you any questions?''
''Well,'' says the boy, ''I still don't understand why virgins don't
drink milk, or eat fish and that.'' Our reading today comes from Matthew
25: the parable of the wise and foolish vegans . . .

Keith Sinclair reports on Europe's remarkably safe record
IT will come as little consolation to passengers who feared for their
lives as flames came from one of their holiday jet's engines during its
abortive flight from Glasgow to Gran Canaria that travelling on a
charter flight to Europe is safer than flying with a large scheduled
airline, and the statistics prove it.
The reason, according to aviation industry experts, is quite simple.
Scheduled airlines operate many older aircraft while most European
charter companies such as Monarch and Britannia are proportionately more
profitable and can afford to renew their fleets more often.
As a result, the Boeing 737 or 757 you might be travelling on to
Majorca or Tenerife this summer is probably younger and so less likely
to develop potentially serious problems such as mechanical failure than
similar or sometimes identical aircraft used by scheduled airlines.
The public perception can contradict this, largely because a charter
flight as part of a standard package holiday is a very inexpensive way
to fly, and some people still equate cheapness with a lack of quality.
Some passengers taking bargain-basement package holidays using
generally smaller and often less-comfortable aircraft -- sometimes flown
by less well-known operators -- have an instinctive fear that aircraft
safety might have been compromised in a bid to reduce costs.
As David Learmount, operations and safety editor of Flight
International magazine explained yesterday: ''People have this concept
that there is something dicey about some charter airlines but that is
about 25 years out of date.''
Official figures show that, although the charter airline network is
more extensive in Europe than anywhere else in the world -- with
millions of holidaymakers flocking by air to the Mediterranean every
year -- it is by far the most sophisticated and the safest.
Air passengers have a one in 16 million chance of dying on a Western
European charter airline -- less than your prospects of winning the
National Lottery jackpot, which are one in 14 million.
An annual review of airline accidents throughout the world by Flight
International, shows that there have been no fatal accidents involving
charter airlines during the first half of this year.
There have, however, been two fatal crashes involving large scheduled
airlines -- Tarom Airlines in Romania, whose A310 Airbus crashed near
Bucharest in March killing all 60 on board, and Harke Air Services in
Nigeria. The aircraft involved in the Romanian tragedy was the same as
that involved in the incident at Glasgow airport.
Last year there were seven fatal scheduled airline accidents
world-wide and one involving a charter flight, which was not a holiday
charter, in Algeria.
Another reason for the good safety record in Europe is the very
demanding safety regulations, which apply to both charter and scheduled
aircraft and in Britain are the responsibility of the Civil Aviation
Authority.
A spokesman for the CAA stressed yesterday that all British aircraft
have to be maintained strictly in accordance with regulations laid down
by the aircraft manufacturer and approved and checked by the CAA.
''Like cars which have to be serviced more often if they are driven
more, a plane's service comes round more often if it is flown more and
the service has to be done by an organisation approved by the CAA. It
can not be flown again until it is signed as fit to fly by CAA-licensed
engineers.
''The turnaround for a plane varies because the aircraft inspection
schedule is different for every aircraft. They have a certain number of
things to do, such as checking the flying controls are working properly,
but the check list for a 767 is not the same as for a 737 any more than
the service required for a Ford is identical to say a Mercedes.''
The CAA has no control over foreign aircraft in Britain -- which
British holiday companies can charter provided they say they use them in
their brochures -- and these remain the responsibility of the
authorities in the country where they are based.
However, the operators of foreign aircraft such as the Oasis airliner
involved in the incident at Glasgow airport are subject to safety
regulations which are almost identical throughout the EC member states.
Mr Learmount declined to comment in detail about the engine fire on
the Oasis aircraft, whose owners have had no accidents since they
started trading under that name in 1986, but said there was probably no
way the pilot could have known in advance that there would be a problem.

WITH the apparent success of the Back to Back Campaign to lay infants
on their backs rather than tummies or sides to sleep, concern over cot
deaths has relaxed. In an uncanny mirroring of the way cot death happens
without any warning, the figures have risen again quite unexpectedly.
The latest available figures show 16 deaths between January and March
this year. In the same three months last year, the figure had dropped to
10, the lowest for several years. The decrease had been steady from 34
in 1991 to 26 in 1992, 18 in 1993 and 10 last year.
Technically, cot death is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, a term which
has been accepted as a cause of death by registrars since 1971, although
inexplicable infant deaths had been happening for centuries.
In most cases an apparently healthy child is laid down to sleep with
no hint of anything unusual, although sometimes they have a slight cold.
When next checked -- sometimes only minutes later -- the baby is dead.
There is no sign of a struggle and many parents have described it as
like a light being switched off.
The Scottish Cot Death Trust was formed 10 years ago to fund research
into the causes of cot death and provide support for bereaved families.
It now supports nine separate research projects costing a total of
#500,000. They are following up a great variety of possible leads, from
exposure to viruses and bacteria to the length of time babies are
exposed to sunlight (most cot deaths occur in the winter months) and the
timing of vaccinations.
The director of the trust, Mrs Hazel Brooke, said that it is too early
to draw any conclusions about the increase in cases this year, but is
concerned that all parents should follow the advice based on the
evidence they have so far. That is to avoid placing the baby to sleep on
its stomach, to avoid smoking during pregnancy and then to keep the baby
in a smoke-free room, to avoid overheating the baby and to consult a
doctor if the baby seems unwell.
In the absence of conclusive research findings, smoking is still the
main risk factor. The risk is increased seven times when the mother
smokes more than 20 cigarettes a day and smoking by other household
members also increases the risk. One of Hazel Brooke's concerns is that
as risk factors are identified, there may be an assumption that parents
whose baby has died have done something wrong, or failed to follow the
guidelines. Her evidence is to the contrary. She said: ''People try
incredibly hard. Most women give up smoking when pregnant and keep their
smoking to another room once the child is born. When there is no obvious
explanation for sudden death bereaved parents can start blaming
themselves, but so far although we have risk factors, none of the
theories have been proved, but many researchers think the babies
probably have very subtle defects which cannot yet be detected.''

It is every parent's
ultimate nightmare,
to wake up one
morning and find
your baby dead.
Tragically, it has just
happened to Brenda
Walker. She tells
Jennifer
Cunningham
of her agony -- and
of how she is trying
to rebuild her life
THE YEAR dawned sunny and glorious. In the afternoon of Sunday January
1, 1995, the proud smiles of Brenda Walker, then 18, and Barry
Henderson, 24, said it all: their daughter was the most beautiful baby
in the world.
Diana Nicol Henderson was not quite six months old when Barry found
her dead in her cot. His attempts at mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and
the ambulance crew's emergency ventilation were too late. The
pathologist estimated she had died four hours earlier.
The achievements of this tiny scrap of humanity in just a few months
were extraordinary. Arriving three weeks early, she weighed in at 5lbs
2oz, at 12.35pm on New Year's Day, in perfect health apart from the
slightest touch of jaundice, and became one of the five New Year babies
whose progress The Herald is following.
At the time, Barry and Brenda were in homeless accommodation in
Bishopbriggs but Diana's arrival speeded up the process of getting them
a house. From the moment they took her home from hospital, she was the
focus of goodwill. Her birth, heralding a new year, was a source of
inspiration to the couple's many friends in the homeless unit. One
caught her first few days on video, which shows her, snug in a woolly
hat, always the centre of admiring attention, usually sleeping.
In delight, Brenda and Barry moved into a two-bedroom house in Milton
of Campsie in February. Friends and relations rallied round with
furniture and they started decorating with great enthusiasm. In Diana's
sunny bedroom they painted the shelves pink to house the enormous
collection of fluffy toys she had been given. The cupboard is still full
of the baby paraphernalia they've collected but the cot, which had been
used for both Brenda and her little brother, has been broken up and
burned. ''You couldn't put another wean in it,'' said Brenda when it was
suggested she should give it to a charity.
Family disapproval had estranged Brenda from her own family, which
meant they had seen very little of the baby. In the shock of her death,
that has been forgotten and Brenda was reconciled with her mother, whose
first child had also died as an infant, but from heart problems. Brenda
had called her baby Diana after that sister she had never known. ''She
died when she was nearly seven months and mine was almost six months. My
mum had just turned 18 and I had just turned 19.''
Painfully they are trying to pick up the pieces of their life. One day
soon they hope to be able to tackle the half-decorated bathroom where
wallpaper brushes have been abandoned since June 22. They hope, now, to
get jobs, which will take them out of the house and allow them to start
paying off their debts. Further in the future they hope to have another
child, ''but maybe not for a couple of years'',  and as she watches the
video of her little daughter's first days, Brenda says she hopes one day
Diana's brothers or sisters will be able to watch it and know they had a
sister.

Paid employment could have provided life's little luxuries but, for
Jean
Sandison, it's just not worth the cost to her child
Being a ''working mum'' in the nineties is not at all uncommon and,
recently, hardly a day has passed when I did not ask myself if life as a
single parent would be easier for myself and for my daughter, Jessica,
if I worked. Financially, it would certainly make things a lot more
comfortable, but would it be right?
I am very grateful for the support I get from the public purse, but
living on state benefit does seem selfish and unfair -- even if I was
the victim and that it was not my choice to leave Jessica fatherless.
However, it is up to me to make life as happy and full as possible for
my little daughter and she deserves nothing less.
As an experiment, I did two weeks' voluntary work for the Highland
Printmakers Workshop and Gallery in Inverness and found it a very
worthwhile experience. Meeting new people, learning new skills, and
eight hours a day of independence was most enjoyable, at least while it
lasted.
Jessica did not agree. She was well looked after by my regular
baby-sitter, but it has taken Jessica and me five days to ''pick up the
pieces'' and we still have a long way to go before things are back to
normal. What had once been a secure, happy, independent little girl
quickly turned into a clinging little wreck.
I feel terribly guilty about it, even although it was only for a short
period, and it has made me realise just how important a mother is in a
young child's life; and, as a single parent, I am not only her mother,
but also her best friend. All she asks of me is to be there --
regardless of the situation -- and I had let her down.
Each morning when I left for work, Jessica would wave goodbye from the
window and I wondered what she was really thinking. Guilt was eating
away at me. Other working mums tried to reassure me, saying: ''She will
adjust, give her time.'' But I know Jessica -- she would cope, yes, as
she did, but adjust? Never.
Some women do not realise how much they have until it is gone and
everything has changed. Working to make more money to pay more bills for
more things. No one could possibly persuade me that this effort is for
the benefit of the child. More toys, or perhaps a holiday in the sun are
of little importance, really.
And I now find it difficult to understand how a mother can want a baby
so much, then, after it is born, happily leave the child all day long in
order to return to work. Surely the welfare of the child must come
first, always.
Every parent naturally wants the best for their children, I understand
that, but having more money is not necessarily going to make them
happier children, only a caring parent can do that. At this stage in
Jessica's life my presence at home provides the vital security which
will help us both cope more ably in the future.
Jessica will never feel neglected, neither will I have feelings of
guilt. Together, we can plan our lives to the benefit of both. I will
continue to study, to draw, paint and pursue my numerous hobbies which
Jessica can share and enjoy with me.
I am there to help her, with eating, dressing, counting, playing,
talking, and it is a privilege to be able to do so. We have so many
happy times together and there is a lot of laughter in our little flat.
We go swimming, to play-groups, our Gaelic language class.
We meet other single mums and share joint problems over a cup of
coffee while our children play together. My two weeks' full-time work
has been a valuable experience and I have no regrets. But I am more
aware now than ever before of my importance as a parent and of the fact
that a child's early years are precious.
There will be time enough when Jessica goes to school to find a job,
but whatever I do will have to be acceptable to both of us, a
partnership agreement. Meanwhile, I shall ignore the people who suggest
that I should be earning money. I shall ignore those who condemn me for
being a full-time mum. I do not mind in the least being called
''stupid'' and ''useless'' -- Jessica knows better, and that is all that
matters to me.

A SMALL ferry company many thought would sink when the Americans
sailed out of Dunoon will unveil its largest investment tomorrow.
The Dunoon-based Western Ferries is to hold a naming ceremony for the
#1.1m Sound of Scalpay, a former municipal ferry in Amsterdam.
The six-figure investment will also herald the rebirth of what was
thought to be a doomed resort.
The company's managing director, Mr Alan Bradley, said yesterday:
''This investment is a major step forward not only for the company but
for the community. When the US Navy left just over three years ago many
thought it was the end of the world.
''But conversely there has been an upturn in the local economy. Last
year we carried more than 370,000 vehicles, an increase of 12% on 1991
when the Americans were still here.''
Mr Bradley said the number of holiday makers using the service had
increased, but there were also more people living in Dunoon and
commuting to Glasgow and west coast towns.
The Sound of Scalpay, now the biggest vessel in the five-strong
Western Ferries fleet, will carry up to 37 vehicles and 220 passengers.
It is scheduled to start operations this week-end, in time for the power
boat spectacular in Dunoon.
Mr Bradley said: ''It's our biggest boat, and our biggest step
forward.''
He added: ''At weekends and peak times we operate four ferries an
hour. With Caledonian MacBrayne's one an hour, Dunoon is better served
by ferries than most towns are by buses.''

A 21-year-old man who admitted a series of five armed robberies at off
licences, filling stations, and a store in Ayrshire was jailed for seven
years at the High Court in Ayr yesterday.
Brinley Kerr, of Old Caley Road, Irvine, admitted: stealing #140 from
Burnside Filling Station, Irvine, after presenting a file at a
20-year-old girl assistant;
Presenting a knife at two girl employees in Haddows off-sales in
Hamilton Street, Saltcoats, and stealing #30;
While acting with another person, assaulting two assistants in
Rolphe's Wines and Spirits in Main Street, Prestwick, presenting a knife
and a baton and stealing #300;
Assaulting two shop assistants at Anne's Store, Burns Street, Irvine,
presenting a knife at them, and robbing them of a cash register and
#113;
Assaulting a male employee at Ravenspark Filling Station, Irvine,
presenting a knife at him, and stealing a quantity of cigarettes. The
offences happened between March 4 and March 16 this year.
Advocate-depute Valerie Stacey told judge Lord Gill that Kerr had
appeared twice in the High Court before -- among his 13 previous
convictions.
Advocate Martin Jones told the court Kerr, who was unemployed, had
been released from custody only in Februaryafter his last sentence and
had become involved with drugs while in custody.
He found it extremely difficult to fund his habit and was the author
of his own misfortunes, the advocate said.
Jailing Kerr for seven years, Lord Gill told him that the sentence
reflected his persistent record of offending.

A PROWLER with a skinhead haircut struck six times in one night in the
same area, a sexual assault trial at the High Court in Glasgow was told
yesterday.
His alleged timetable of terror began with the rape of a 31-year-old
secretary. Soon after, two women -- a 35-year-old social worker and a
17-year-old schoolgirl -- were attacked.
Later the same night, a barmaid making her way home became frightened
when a man followed her, and a 26-year-old woman alone in her flat was
confronted by a stranger who knocked on her door.
Then, three women in a car described how they spotted the man lurking
in a close and followed him when he came out.
On trial is a 15-year-old boy who cannot be named for legal reasons.
He denies rape, four charges of assault with intent to rape, and four
charges of placing women in a state of fear and alarm.
Two of the alleged incidents are said to have taken place on the night
of July 2 last year, and five on the night of December 2, all in the
Govanhill area of Glasgow.
On Friday, the secretary had told how she was dragged into a close in
Allison Street by a youth. She said she was raped twice and dragged by
the hair through backcourts by a skinhead who said he had a knife and
warned her he was going to kill her.
Yesterday, the jury heard details of what was alleged to have happened
on December 2.
A 35-year-old social worker told how she was walking along Torrisdale
Street at around 11.30pm when she felt the presence of a man following
her. She opened the front security door leading to her tenement flat and
was followed in by a man who shouldered the door before it locked.
The man punched her repeatedly on the head and she screamed. She felt
a tremendous blow to the head before he let her go and ran from the
close. She said she could not identify her assailant, who had closely
cropped hair.
The woman was followed into the witness box by an 18-year-old who was
a schoolgirl at the time of the alleged incident involving her.
She told the court she was in Torrisdale Street about 11.45pm when a
man with a skinhead haircut grabbed her by the hair and tried to pull
her into a close. He said he had a knife and told her: ''Don't scream or
I'll stab you.''
Then a car's headlights picked them out the attacker fled, she said.
At a later identification parade and in court, the girl picked out the
accused as being like her attacker.
Another woman, a 43-year-old barmaid told how she was followed by a
young skinhead man in Torrisdale Street at about 11.40pm. As she hurried
to her flat, she saw neighbours and shouted to them and the young man
disappeared.
Sometime between 11.45pm and midnight, a 26-year-old woman who was
alone in her flat went to answer the door.
She told the court she opened it to a skinhead who she identified,
both at a parade and in court, as the accused. He asked if there were
any men in the flat and she told him no, then became nervous and closed
the door.
As she called the police, the door was knocked again and after they
left the accused knocked once again.
Three other women told the court that, at around 20 minutes past
midnight, they saw the accused loitering in a close in Niddrie Road,
where one of them lived.
The trial before Lord McCluskey continues.

BANNERS in the streets proclaim that at the weekend it will be Glasgow
Fair. In more than one way it has become a flagging event. What's
usually the best of the good news that the streamers bring is an
improved likelihood of some refreshing downpours.
Without crabbing the carnival, it is hard not to say that if the
citizenry need to be reminded it's fun time, the holiday can hardly be
in their hearts any more. The Fair feels on its last legs.
But so it has been for most of its 800 years or so.
In that longish stretch of fortnights the Fair has had five different
forms, maybe six. Its magic is to have caught on at all. For it was a
gift of the nobs. Licensed by a king, the festival's big fans were the
merchants. They saw it as good for business.
For that reason the lieges, in their contrary way, might have rejected
the occasion. Instead, they accepted the main event for the sake of its
sideshows.
Farmers at first used the market to hire field hands and house
servants. It was to relieve the serfs of any readies they had on them
that the showmen moved in. Their plucking ground was at the top of the
town around the cathedral. Gradually it went downhill to Glasgow Green,
which the street banners again make the core of July.
For fringe attractions see the official tourist guide. ''Glasgow is
great!'' it exclaims. Wherein lies the greatness is the subject of a
warm introductory essay. Presumably in deliberate order, it details the
city's delights as (1) museums, (2) architecture, and (3) great
shopping.
Giving museums the topmost spot seems a deadly choice. Perversely, it
has always been so. History's lesson is that city visitors looked first
for a museum. In a way they did, although they expressed their interest
less positively. For museums they used a muted code word. They went on
and on about rain. Getting out of it was their big ambition.
With most memorable frequency, nearly all of the namely tourists who
afterwards wrote extended postcards about their time in Glasgow mention
the weather. Charles Dickens nearly sank the city with his reference.
''It rains as it never does rain anywhere else, and always does it
rain here. It is a dreadful place . . .'' he wrote.
Weather apart, Glasgow people enjoy the belief that the city's best
tourist feature is themselves. With good reason, they claim to have a
knack for being hospitable. They know patience. To lost strangers they
are helpful. More than just give directions to visitors, they walk them
to where they want to go. That way tourists and native guide get lost
together.
Very important travellers chronicled an opposite impression. They
found the city beautiful, but a pity about its inhabitants. Never mind
the bad behaviour, they did not even smell good.
Samuel Pepys confided to his diary a rooted nastiness he encountered.
And notoriously in his holiday journal Robert Southey, when poet
laureate, was adverse even to Glasgow Cathedral. ''The other fault (he
sniffed) belongs to the unclean part of the national character; for the
seats are so closely packed that any person who could remain there
during the time of service in warm weather, must have an invincible
nose.''
The Green in its time has given a go sign to all and any high jinks.
Possibly its most cautionary tale was recounted by one James Hall, a
gossipy clergyman, on his hols. In the park he joined a cheering circle
around a couple on the grass. The Rev Mr Hall, who missed nothing of the
spectacle, wrote in his book: ''One of the inhabitants, with an
abandoned woman, that had agreed to it, did what even cats, elephants,
and many other of the inferior animals avoid in public, for a Scotch
pint of gin.''
So frisky did the Fair become that even ladies of pleasure imported
from Edinburgh took a trick.
On the Green in July every arm of showbiz was in full swing -- travel
shows, penny peepshows, waxworks, Highland dancers, kiltie comics. The
Fair's stage was all the world. This year's Paris accent to the carnival
is not new. Back in 1850 the performers included a French gymnastic
professor along with a black comedian, an Ethiopian songstress, and an
American rope dancer. (He danced on a rope.) It was showtime in every
saloon down the Saltmarket.
Nor was drinking unheard of on the Green. No patch of the park was
left untenanted if it had enough room for a refreshment booth. Because
the citizenry started to enjoy themselves so much and came to make the
junketing so thoroughly their own, the magistrates had a fit about good
order and closed the showground. That was in 1871.
What Glasgow people did next remains significant. Undaunted, with the
Green shut to them, they extended their holidays. More and more they
went away. Their July fancy turned to going down the water to Saltcoats
and even Rothesay.
From the start the Fair has been a people's holiday. In one form or
another they made their own. Whatever festival was offically granted to
them they changed to suit themselves. Nothing so much improved their old
Fair as being told they could not have it. Now another prohibition might
again work wonders.
Instead of trying to beef up the wilting holiday with banners, the
city should try a ban on it. Then there'd be fun.

AS a widowed octogenarian, and a Conservative voter all my life, I
feel compelled to express my disapproval of the extra #1000 plus which
is being given to the mothers of four-year-olds to help with nursery
education.
Surely if children are really wanted the parents should willingly
accept the financial sacrifice involved.
For several years now, when one reaches the ripe old age of 80, an
increase of 25p is added to the pension -- enough to pay for the
first-class stamp needed to post this letter.

THERE was no hyperbole either inherent or implied in my letter anent
Private Clegg, released from prison that I prefer to call captivity
because I have known it myself (July 1).
Injustice knows no parameters and because Private Clegg has played a
minor part in the scheme of things make no difference to me even if it
does to Mr Devine (July 5).
Private Clegg was no part of the Irish dimension until posted to
Ireland with his unit -- he might just as well have been posted to
Germany, Bosnia, or any other NATO UK posting -- it was simply his bad
luck to be pitchforked into the Irish dimension that was no part of his
making and so, though I do not know the man, I'll fight his corner to
the end against the Irish Government, the IRA/Sinn Fein gangsters, and
the British Government whose quasi-judicial system that took more than a
year to stitch up a case that would appear to hold water but leaks like
a sieve -- else why has Clegg been released? -- for just as long as it
takes.
The name Clegg is made fall guy by the persons and people I've
mentioned, all in the name of the quasi ''peace process'', a chimera if
ever there was one.
From now on any sentry, any guard of the British Army should wear his
body armour front to back to protect himself not merely from the slings
and arrows of the IRA/Sinn Fein lot but from Brutus in the form of the
civil power that placed him in the forefront of terrorism's battle, then
not merely stood aloof but turned upon him.
Elsewhere in your columns Caiaphas, in the guise of Cardinal Cahal
Daly, describes Clegg's release as a ''crass blunder''.
I commend to him another look at Luke, Chapter VII, where he might
just learn a thing or two about respect for law and order -- held in
such low esteem in his own bailiwick that the flouting of it is ascribed
to joy, as in ''joyriding'' on the one hand, and the upholding of it to
murder on the other hand.
Finally, have the family of the dead car thieves -- ''joyriders'' --
made restitution to the owner of the car stolen and wrecked by their
offspring?
Not one of the parties in this whole luckless episode, not the Church,
not the Judiciary, not the Army, for sure not the IRA/SF and the
Loyalist factions, has given a second thought to the only other innocent
victim in this whole affair in which all of Ireland is culpable.

MR J F Montgomerie asserts that socialism has failed while blithely
ignoring Jack Angus's central point that socialism has never existed
(July 6).
If Mr Montgomerie accepts that, how can he logically claim that
socialism has failed? If not, then we demand sight of the evidence.
Let's be clear about this. There has never been a socialist society
anywhere, nor has there ever been any attempt to establish one.
Mr Montgomerie adds that socialism is based upon the false assumption
that people are perfect. Where is his evidence? Certainly we do reject
pessimistic assumptions about human nature, based as they often are upon
the childish fantasies of the Book of Genesis or the scribblings of such
as Mr William Golding.
That is not to say, however, that we therefore endorse the equal and
opposite myth of a perfect (or perfectible) human race. If the
pessimists are right (and Mr Montgomerie is clearly one such) then
society would be impossible. On the other hand, if the optimists are
right, then society would simply be unnecessary. A plague on both their
houses.
The point is not to derive our concepts of human society from
religious notions or from philosophical speculations about the nature of
man, a la Hobbes or Rousseau. Socialism is based upon what we actually
know about humanity's real history.
Taking that as our standpoint, we can see that human society has
evolved through a number of successive forms, each new form having
emerged out of, and on the basis of, its predecessors.
We think it reasonable to conclude that modern society, capitalism,
will turn out to be no different in this respect. Capitalism has not
existed since time immemorial, and there is no reason to suppose that it
will not be replaced in its turn by something new.
To this ''something new'' we give the name socialist (or communism,
the name itself is immaterial). It follows that this would be no ideal
society, conceived in the mind of a genius and foisted upon reality from
without, as it were. It would be formed from elements which are already
to hand.
Today we find highly developed productive powers, well capable of
satisfying the needs of the entire planet. We see a highly socialised
structure of production, which unites the world, potentially at least,
in one vast co-operative network. There is a growing and increasingly
sophisticated working class, which comprises the overwhelming majority
of the population. And there is the growth of a minimum level of
political democracy.
Against this there are capitalism's social relations, which operate as
a fetter on humanity's potential, depriving the majority of any real
control over the products of their own hands.
Socialism would be nothing more or less than the product of the
recognition on the part of this majority of their exploited, subordinate
position within this society, and their acting upon this recognition to
remove the barriers placed by capitalism in the way of their fuller
development as human beings.
It is a possible result of conditions which already exist and will
continue to exist as long as there is capitalism.
Those who wish to master the tenets of socialism would do well to
consult real socialists, rather than Mr J F Montgomerie, his Shorter
Oxford Dictionary, or his Ladybird book of human history.

FROM the early nineteenth century various kind of socialist movements
have been with us and it is evident from the confused response of J F
Montgomerie (July 6) that he thinks those who are still committed to
socialism are all Stalinist remnants or Labour Party fellow-staggerers;
and it is thought, crassly, that we can learn about socialism from a
dictionary.
Marxian socialism (whatever the Stalinist distortions) is based not on
the notion that humans are perfect, as J F Montgomerie imagines, but on
the opposite premise; that human society can only begin to free itself
from imperfection when capitalist exploitation and class society have
ended, and we can live in co-operation rather than competition.
Further, no-one can give the working class its freedom. The slavery of
capitalism can only be abolished by the organised slaves themselves,
when the slaves refuse to work for anyone but themselves and take over
control.
Meanwhile because of alienated market forces we are all existing in
conditions of social conflict which distorts even our most intimate
personal relationships and desire for wholeness or perfection.
This notion of perfection is ''religious'', but not in a doctrinal or
ideological sense, as J F Montgomerie would have it, but the contentless
indefinable ground of our being -- ''the kingdom within'', as Jesus put
it.
And it was not religious ideology that drove the early Christians into
sharing all things in common, but the spiritual awareness that open
human relationships could only be achieved when possessions were given
up.
This was communism in limited practice, but only centuries later could
genuine communism become possible world-wide, through the breaking of
the dictatorship of international capitalism.

THE United Nations has announced that July 11 is World Population Day,
claiming the biggest threat we face is over-population. Drawing
attention to the Third World, the discussion will centre on women's
empowerment but the underlying message will remain -- there are too many
people on the planet and Third World mothers are to blame.
The days are gone when Indians were offered a transistor radio if they
agreed to sterilisation. Today's strategies focus on family planning and
women's health. Previously critical aid organisations such as Oxfam have
been brought on side. Why? Because the pseudo-feminist language of
reproductive choice tallies with their own radical outlooks.
What has really changed? The old population control programmes and the
new ''women-centred'' schemes are both targeted at the Third World but
organised in the West and sponsored by western governments.
An African government lecturing British single mothers about parental
responsibility and condoms would seem a ridiculous interference.
Reversed, the situation is called ''empowerment''.
As for women's choice, here sterile women are provided with fertility
treatment. Who suggests that Third World women should have the same
facilities?
In poor countries where children are an insurance for old age,
infertility treatment is arguably even more vital. But it turns out the
only choice allowed is to limit family size.
The discussion should focus on the role Western governments and banks
play in sustaining Third World poverty instead of worrying about how
many black babies are being born.

FAR too many people are terrified by the very word ''radiation'' (July
7). The thought of its being near them offends their sensibilities. Any
reasonably educated person should be aware of the medical benefits it
can bring, whether through radiotherapy or through use as tracers, eg
iodine-131 (which has a half life of a mere 8.6 days).
These treatments and tracers were not bestowed upon us from on high.
The ground work and experimentation had to be done sometime. Of course
no-one wants to be a guinea-pig but somebody must.
The fear of radiation is such that there are very few people willing
to become involved in research. If the research is to be carried out,
however, it is only too clear that not all the guinea-pigs can be
enlisted of their own free will.
As for the experimentation on the bones of dead children, if the
families of the dead were not aware of the proceedings then I fail to
see what harm was done. Though I do not wish to belittle the grief of
Mrs Brown, when she said: ''If they had asked me for his heart to save
another baby, it would have been hard but I would have done it.''
I have to ask her if she would have been willing, if asked, to allow
the removal of some of her son's bones for experimentation. I would
suggest that she would have been unwilling despite the fact that through
the experimentation many lives may have been saved but through the heart
transplant only one life could have been prolonged.
People are only too willing to reap the rewards of medical research.
How can they justify throwing their hand up in horror at the thought of
the research being done?

CHRISTOPHER SIMS makes several telling points in respect of GEC's
annual returns (Business Herald, July 6).
Looking primarily at the defence side of GEC's operation it has to be
said that neither the company's increased profit margins nor its
ever-increasing cash mountain (presently at #2950m) provide comfort to
those employees who are currently facing the prospect of redundancy at
rock-bottom severance terms (or who have already experienced the
misfortune of redundancy with only statutory minimum redundancy
payments).
GEC's profits are generated as a result of the efforts of the
workforce and while it is recognised that some of the problems currently
being experienced by the major defence manufacturers are as a result of
factors outwith their direct control (eg the shift in Government defence
procurement policy and the move away from cost plus) this should not be
seen as justification for continually hitting the workforce with
redundancy after redundancy.
Since GEC bought the Ferranti Defence Systems business some five years
ago the workers in the former Ferranti defence plants across Scotland
have been faced with some nine redundancy declarations which have seen
the numbers of employed reduced from about 6500 to present levels of
about 3500 -- all of this coupled with a reduction of the severance
terms being made available to redundant workers.
This from a company which continues to increase its profits year on
year and can afford to splash out some #800m to purchase the Vickers
submarine yard at Barrow.
Where in all of this is any commitment on the part of the company to a
workforce which have given many years of loyal service to ensure that
the company maintains its position in the forefront of technology? The
answer is quite clearly none.
After all, it was Lord Weinstock who went on the record to declare
that he was only in business to make money not engineering products.
Christopher Sims is correct in his assertion that GEC will undoubtedly
make more money this year although it has to be asked at what price will
that money be made and at whose expense.
No doubt the workforce will once again be expected to be on the
receiving end whilst the cash mountain will continue to grow.
Would it not be much more acceptable all round if Lord Weinstock were
to declare that he is prepared to divert some of the cash mountain to
provide a cushion to the workforce in his defence plants to ensure that
they have some guarantees of continuing employment while at the same
time allocating another chunk of his #2950m into seriously tackling the
question of diversification into non-defence-related areas by utilising
the skills and technology which already exist within GEC's vast business
empire?

IT looks increasingly as if Mr Blair's model for new Labour's
relations with the trade unions is that between America's Democrats and
Labor. There the two are close enough to be mutually supportive,
something which involves the unions -- though with degrees of difference
between states -- contributing finance, but not so close that voters
imagine the party is controlled or unduly influenced by them. Mr Blair
argued strongly for something of that nature yesterday in his speech to
the Transport and General Workers, a large union which has so far been
markedly hostile to his reforms. Its leadership will continue to oppose
him on this aspect of his policies as well as on the issue of minimum
wages, where it is all for spelling out a precise minimum, of over #4 a
week, now. Mr Blair was anything but contrite yesterday. He knows very
well that Labour must not give the impression of returning to the union
closeness of the Wilson years, or even the ambivalent position enforced
on the party during the miners' strike, which so played into the hands
of Mrs Thatcher. His message was that new Labour must be free to pursue
the national interest without being beholden to any particular group.
Mr Blair was in effect appealing over the heads of his immediate
audience to the wider electorate and recognising that the unions, though
not as unpopular as they were, are still likely to be regarded with
suspicion, something which the Government would love to be in a position
to exploit. The same intention to guard his flanks explains why Mr Blair
is anxious to avoid spelling out a precise figure for a national minimum
wage while endorsing the policy of having one. It is harder to share his
thinking there. He says he wants to consult unions and employers only
after a General Election, but their views are not likely to be dependent
on the size of his majority, nor does the identity of the Government of
the day have much bearing on the actual level set as the minimum. It
cannot be much affected either by the ''need to consult the books''
argument which cautious politicians claim relieves them of the necessity
of specifics before and during election campaigns. On the basis of known
data it should be perfectly possible for Mr Blair and his advisers to
say what their minimum would be. He will almost certainly be forced to
do so during the election campaign.
The trouble is that it looks as if any figure Mr Blair names, whenever
he names it, will upset the T &amp; G as being lower than what it would
like. Mr Blair's feeling that naming a figure now would be
''counterproductive'' really means that it would merely absorb Labour's
energies and divert them to internal debate, the sort of thing which the
party was adept at in the past but which it has managed to leave to the
Conservatives these past three years. In a curious way his firm stance
vis-a-vis his friends is one of Mr Blair's electorally appealing
characteristics. Whatever old Labour owed to the unions, new Labour is
determined not to be in their pockets. How far that determination would
survive experience is anyone's guess but it is surely the right starting
position.

Gareth Smyth talks to a man who faces death each day as Saddam
Hussein's main political opponent
* AHMAD CHALABI was born 50 years ago in Baghdad, the youngest of a
liberal Shia political family. He studied at MIT and Chicago before
becoming a mathematics professor at the American University of Beirut in
the 1970s.
After 1977 he ran the Petra Bank in Jordan, when he was also a board
member of Visa International. In 1989 he was deposed by military decree
-- the result, Chalabi has always claimed, of the then good relations
between King Hussein and Saddam. Chalabi left Jordan but was convicted,
in his absence, of stealing $25m and sentenced to 22 years' jail.
A SUITE of offices overlooking London's Hyde Park seems a long way
from the tumult, dust and bloodshed of modern Iraq. In an Armani suit,
Ahmad Chalabi looks every inch the politician. He seems well enough, but
his face is a little drawn.
For Chalabi these days, this is a rare visit to the West. The head of
the Iraqi National Congress (INC), the main opposition group to Saddam
Hussein, has spent the past 18 months in the mountains of northern Iraq.
There he has set up an INC base on Iraqi soil -- at the former mountain
resort of Salahuddin, in the zone held by Kurdish guerrillas since the
Allies established ''safe havens'' in the aftermath of the Gulf War.
During that time, Chalabi has survived nine assassination attempts. On
one occasion, assailants fired rocket-propelled grenades at his car. I
ask who was responsible. ''All Saddam,'' he says quickly.
I first came across Ahmad Chalabi in northern Iraq in 1992. Within
three months we met twice more -- in Vienna, as he brought together the
opposition to Saddam for the first time as one coalition, and then in
Washington, as an INC deputation met top US officials.
Those were heady days as hopes for change were raised by Saddam's
defeat in the Gulf War. Three years later Saddam is still in power
despite several attempted coups. The people of Iraq face acute food and
medical shortages. There has been Kurd-on-Kurd violence in ''liberated''
northern Iraq, and the Shia resistance in the southern marshlands has
been brutally crushed.
Uniting the opposition has never been easy. The Ba'ath Party has
thrived on sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia Arabs and between
Arabs and Kurds.
The INC originally included the Kurds and liberal Arabs. But
crucially, Chalabi soon brought on board the Supreme Council for the
Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), the main Shia group confronting the
Iraqi army in the south. Chalabi drew up a programme for representative
government and Kurdish autonomy within a federal Iraq -- emphasising the
need for the rule of law.
Pitted against one of the world's most ruthless regimes, the INC's
progress has been mixed. But Chalabi's political project has been
threatened by armed conflict between the Kurds in which hundreds, if not
thousands, have died.
The primary fault for the fighting lies, he says, with the two main
Kurdish political parties, Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). ''They
are nice to one another in meetings, and they then give different orders
to their sub-ordinates.''
A ceasefire negotiated by the INC for the KDP and PUK failed to last.
Fighting erupted again at the beginning of this year and the INC
withdrew its observers. ''It quickly proliferated into all-out warfare,
this time with the determination to seek victory over the other side,''
he recalls.
A three-month ceasefire was this week extended at talks in Tehran. But
stalemate remains.
Chalabi is insistent that the Western powers must become more
involved. Having created the ''safe haven'', he says, the West left it
in ''diplomatic limbo, neither recognised as an independent state nor as
part of the Iraqi state which exercised token sovereignty over it''.
The West has a ''lack of policy'' over Iraq, says Chalabi. ''Sanctions
impose enormous hardship on the people. They are designed to make Saddam
harmless to Iraq's neighbours, but in the absence of a policy to help
the INC remove Saddam, the hardship is very difficult to justify.''
Western leaders, he says, fear that ''change in Iraq, unless under
very narrow conditions, will benefit Iran''. Having been taken by
surprise by Ayatollah Khomeini's 1979 revolution, the West has ever
since had an exaggerated fear of Iran. But the West's belief in a smooth
army coup overthrowing Saddam -- avoiding the uncertainties of popular
uprising -- is ''pure political fantasy'', says Chalabi.
Baghdad is controlled by special units of the Republican Guard.
''Change will come through the armed forces, but not acting in a vacuum.
Waiting for a coup is a hope, not a policy.''
Chalabi is encouraged by last month's army uprising in Ramadi, ''the
Sunni heartland''. And clashes between INC forces and Iraqi troops will
continue, he says.
Chalabi seems unperturbed by recent reports that Massoud Barzani is
considering a deal with Saddam. ''What can Saddam offer?'' he says. ''If
the regime comes back, there will be quiet. But it will be the quiet of
the grave.''

Kirsty Scott examines why France is willing to incur worldwide
condemnation by conducting a final series of nuclear tests at Mururoa
atoll
EXACTLY 50 years ago next Sunday, the desert of New Mexico was rocked
by the world's first nuclear test as the scientists labouring on
America's Manhattan Project put the final touches to the atomic bomb.
Half a century on, and more than 2000 tests later, the focus has
shifted to the tiny Mururoa atoll in the South Pacific where France has
caused global outrage by announcing that it plans to conduct eight new
tests between September and May.
As Greenpeace activists tussle with teargas-throwing French commandos
and New Zealand struggles to find a diplomatic solution to the imminent
tests, many scientists are trying to unravel the reasoning behind what
is turning into a public relations disaster.
It was in April 1992 that the then French President Francois
Mitterrand committed France to a moratorium on nuclear tests. Until that
point France had pounded Mururoa with more than 130 atmospheric and
underground nuclear explosions. Last month, the new President, Jacques
Chirac, citing the ''higher interests of our nation'' made the
announcement that they were to carry out the eight tests on the atoll.
Their defiance in the face of global opinion is inexplicable to some,
but the French have always bucked the trend when it comes to nuclear
weaponry. They have lined up for the US-sponsored ban on nuclear weapons
testing by 1996, but have worked alone in developing their own arsenal
of weapons and have apparently shrugged off opportunities to collaborate
or learn from other nuclear powers.
''France has had an independent nuclear programme unlike Britain,
which has had an integrated testing programme with the Americans in
Nevada since the 1960s,'' said Dr Simon Ball, an expert in nuclear
weapons at Glasgow University. ''The Americans don't need to do any more
tests and that means that Britain is not going to do any more tests
because the Americans won't let them.''
Socialist Prime Minister Pierres Mendes-France was the man who
committed France to building the bomb in 1954 and the country's first
nuclear test took place six years later in the Sahara.
The key to the French position appears to be that they need to do the
eight new Mururoa tests to give them the know-how to move towards
alternative forms of testing once the full-scale ban is in place.
So far so understandable. But the know-how for computer-simulated
tests and other alternative laboratory methods is already there in the
brains and software of American scientists, and all the French would
have to do is ask.
''The French say they need to carry out these tests in order to get
the data and the techniques necessary to convert to a laboratory
environment,'' said Suzanne van Moyland of the London-based scientific
thinktank the Verification Technology Information Centre. ''Even if this
is the case, America and Britain, who have been doing this kind of thing
for five years, would be happy to help. It is a case, probably, of pride
on the French part.
''When Mitterrand stopped the testing in 1992 it was in an environment
where everyone felt there was no way these tests could be justified. He
interrupted the testing programme of the military and what we are seeing
now is them going back to their programme.''
The French have indicated that they are working on a hugely expensive
laser project called PALEN, a weapons experimentation programme, but
it's thought the facility will not be operational until the turn of the
century.
The fact that France is pushing ahead with the Mururoa tests before
next year's proposed ban may also indicate the type of project being
tested. While computer simulation and laboratory methods can effectively
check existing weapons, scientists say new nuclear weapons, or
drastically changed ones, do need full-scale tests.
''I'm afraid you do need tests to check new warhead designs or
significantly altered designs,'' said Suzanne van Moyland. ''That may
give some indication that this is to do with upgrades. My general
feeling is that it is for new weaponry.''
She is worried at the apparent backtracking by a number of the nuclear
powers who are now making noises about tests using only a small amount
of material, or the low-yield threshold as it is known.
''No-one's official position has changed but the rumblings have done
enough to make the non-nuclear weapon states wonder whether they can
rely on the nuclear weapon states to keep their side of the bargain.''
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, meanwhile, has attacked France
unreservedly for this most recent infraction. CND say that under the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, France had pledged to ''exercise the
utmost restraint'' with regard to testing until a comprehensive test ban
treaty was signed, and have now broken that promise.
''We feel that it is outrageous. How can they ignore world opinion and
the environmental and health consequences,'' said spokeswoman Elana
Kravitz.
France has remained stoically silent about the uproar. The country is
proud of its independent defence policy and is also heavily dependent on
nuclear energy. There is no real anti-nuclear movement to speak of and
officials are managing to keep the veil of secrecy drawn over their
plans as much today as they were when they first started. There is
clearly no small irony in the fact that Mururoa atoll means, in the
language of the native people, the place of the great secret.

THE demise of the old building society movement has been on the cards
for some time but the process is now speeding up. Mainly the product of
Victorian middle and working-class thrift and with a strong regional
focus, the societies were bound to encounter pressure to merge in the
face of the challenge from large, and often more efficient, competitors
(like banks). These have access to wholesale money rather than the
accumulated, and expensively collected, deposits of hundreds of
thousands of customer-members. Abbey National itself helped lead the way
with its own conversion to a bank but last year Lloyds Bank broke new
ground by buying the well-regarded Cheltenham and Gloucester, a mutual
society, for #1600m; and this year the Halifax, the country's largest
society, agreed a merger with the Leeds. Abbey now has announced its
absorption of the National and Provincial society in a huge deal which
will distribute #1350m to that society's members, even ones of short
duration. Obviously those who know the business best believe that there
is a lot of life in the housing market yet and that the provision of
mortgages will continue to be lucrative, though there are grounds for
thinking that margins will be squeezed very hard as the competition from
the new giants hots up. Abbey's move has a defensive element and it jars
somewhat with its declared aim of getting 40% of its profits from
sources other than its traditional ones within the next few years.
Bigness does deliver benefits and Abbey hopes to derive efficiencies
from the less well-managed N &amp; P by applying its own systems and closing
more than 100 overlapping branches. It is hard to deny that a
generalised process of rationalisation will reduce choice, the
self-interested observation of the finance union, Bifu, but that will be
offset for borrowers by cheaper mortgages, especially as the day has
gone when most societies retained a local touch and were especially
understanding to individual members when assessing requests for loans.
Indeed the ease with which members have voted to exchange their
beneficial membership for some hard cash should make all existing mutual
societies reconsider their relations with members (Nationwide is making
big efforts in this respect). The defence of mutual structures
yesterday, from the chairman of the Building Societies Association,
included the claim that the societies did not distribute profits to
third-party shareholders but retained these in the business to the
benefit of their customers who are members. That will fall on deaf ears.
Building societies have tended to ignore their members and depositors
over the years, for example not sharing the benefits of insurance
commissions and often even exploiting them by insisting on inappropriate
endowment-linked mortgages to benefit from additional commissions. The
theoretical benefits of mutuality have, sadly, not always been obvious
to society members. There is no fund of goodwill among depositors for
traditional mutual building societies. Even the claim that their loans
tend to be cheaper than those bodies which have to pay dividends to
shareholders bears little examination: the Abbey has not been beaten by
the mutuals since it became a bank.
One aspect of these giant deals should not be ignored, though it forms
no part of the thinking of their creators. Some millions of people,
particularly in the North and Midlands of England, the cradle of the
societies, will be receiving tax-free lumps of cash, or easily cashable
shares in the present case. The injection of this money, some billions
of pounds, will have an impact on the economy and may even make some
recipients feel good, the very quality so far escaping the Government.
So will the defensive response of those societies wishing to retain
their mutual status, for they will only do so if they start delivering
real, rather than theoretical, benefits to their members.

IT WAS noted that the English Test team scored the same number of runs
in the second innings at Edgbaston against the West Indies as John
Major's opponents scored votes in the leadership election.
Another way of putting it would be that John Major's opponents scored
twice as many votes as the English cricket team scored runs in the
second inning against the West Indies at Port of Spain last year.
There is a remarkable similarity between excuses trotted out by the
England cricket team and the Tory hierarchy after by-elections.
At Edgbaston the excuse was ''a bad pitch''. Yet on the day the Test
began the England management praised the pitch.
The Tories blame by-elections on bad weather keeping their supporters
at home, ignoring the fact that bad weather hits supporters of all
parties.
The English cricket team is John Major's Government at play -- it
fights back but it never lasts.

IT was not the attendant PR which best illuminated Gazza's new Ibrox
career yesterday but the file of players shuffling from the front door
of the stadium to a minibus to go to Pollok Park for training. This was
in the morning, before the afternoon frenzy of the official press
conference and the arrival of a football-crazy public.
Paul Gascoigne shuffled out, head bowed, among McCoist, Ferguson, and
McCall. Durrant, oblivious to everything except the night before, yawned
and rubbed his eyes. But in the slow push forward between police
barriers, while 100 weans screamed and waved football programmes to be
signed, Gazza kept a tight hold of the ball. His possession could only
be a sign of great moments to come.
Paul Gascoigne was a compliant and willing monkey for the radio, TV,
and press circus. Earnest questions from British journalists were
efficiently dealt with, he maintained the right amount of respect and
interest in their cliched inquiries regarding injuries, disappointments,
and working under the spotlight. But Gazza was bored. It was obvious.
The man only wants to play football.
Gazza in Govan was pure showbiz. Fat and po-faced sports journalists,
who were given a private press call to the exclusion of news reporters
and feature writers, grew ruddy-faced in the greenhouse temperatures of
the Blue Room, while the chants of the 2500-strong mob outside drowned
out the star's voice with ''Hello, Hello, we are the Billy Boys'' and
The Sash.
Given the enormity of sound, fury, and passion blasting the open
windows, (reporters had to keep shutting them to block the noise, hence
the heat) Gazza seemed somewhat removed from the sectarian karaoke.
Footballers hear criticism, threats of violence, and declarations of
love from supporters when they're on the field. He is inured to the mob,
the Protestant or the professional kind.
There are very few moments in life, however, when you witness the
hysteria of men and boys openly and publicly expressing a deep need to
see another man succeed. ''He's only a bloody footballer,'' as one hack
observed bad-temperedly. No, frankly, he's not. The sea of
blue-and-white jerseys and blond copycat haircuts screamed and held up
scarves like pubescent teenies.
Mounted polis placed their horses between Ibrox main door and the
crowd. When Paul Gascoigne finally sauntered out into the sun in his
Rangers issue flip-flops to say hello, the rush of sound came at the
press inside as big and as deadly as ground to a parachutist.
Ibrox is a landmark. It signifies what some men love, William of
Orange, football, and winning. Gazza has pledged his allegiance.
It was a tough day for reporters. All afternoon the press were ushered
this way and that by frazzled security guards. We were finally invited
on to the pitch, for photo calls and TV interviews, then were chided by
groundsmen for spoiling it.
''Do you think you'll have any problems with the language barrier?'' a
Herald colleague asked good-naturedly, referring to the difficulties he
had understanding people in Italy. ''Ah ken, man, no,'' replied Gazza,
leaving everyone in absolutely no doubt that he would.
He seemed like a nice bloke and feeling rather sorry for him, as women
are prone to apparently, I moved in with a question about whether he
enjoyed the paparazzi fuss.
''No, but it has to be done,'' he said, posing for yet another pic.
''But it's nice to feel wanted again.'' This is a man who thought his
number was up for good.

AGENT Rune Hauge, at the heart of the George Graham ''bung''
allegations, is keeping everyone guessing about whether he will make a
dramatic intervention in the hearing into the conduct of the sacked
Arsenal manager.
Representatives of IK Start, the Norwegian club involved in one of the
transfer deals which has led to Mr Graham, 50, being charged with
misconduct, were the first to give evidence to the three-man Football
Association commission yesterday.
Highbury chairman Peter Hill-Wood and chief executive Ken Friar are
expected to recount their side of the story when the three-day hearing
resumes in North London today.
However, although both sides have approached Mr Hauge, there has so
far been no sign of the controversial Norwegian who, it is alleged, made
payments of #425,500 to Mr Graham following the signings of Pal Lydersen
and John Jensen.
''I am not going to make any comment at this stage,'' replied Mr
Graham's barrister, Mr Anthony Arlidge, QC, when asked if Mr Hauge was
lined up on his side.
Similarly, an FA spokesman said: ''There has been some communication
with Mr Hauge but I do not know whether he intends to appear.''
Mr Hauge co-operated with the Premier League inquiry into transfer
irregularities, which led to Mr Graham's dismissal following the
publication of its interim report in February. He has also been
interviewed by FA officials.
However, as he is now under investigation by the Skattedirektoratet --
the Norwegian tax authority -- he may be reluctant to expose himself to
unneccessary questioning.
It is alleged that Interclub Ltd, linked to Mr Hauge, made two
payments to Mr Graham in 1991 and 1992 and that Mr Graham had repaid the
money plus #40,000 interest to Arsenal in December last year.
With the FA haunted by Mr Alan Sugar's successful legal challenge to
its punishment on Tottenham for financial irregularities last season,
nobody expects Mr Graham's fate to be announced this week.
If Mr Graham is found guilty he could face a lengthy ban from the
game, which could be extended worldwide, although it is thought more
likely he will be fined heavily.
The commission, headed by top FA official Geoff Thompson, began by
hearing from former chief officials of IK Start, Mr Finn Hansen and Mr
Erik Stalleno, who were both involved in negotiations for Lydersen's
move to Arsenal in November 1991.
The London club paid #500,000 and has always insisted it was unaware
the Norwegian club had agreed a price of #215,000, later dropped to
#190,000.
The difference of #310,000 was paid to Interclub Ltd in Guernsey, and
Interclub paid #140,500 in cash to a bank account in Dublin on December
23, 1991.
The hearing will also investigate the transfer of John Jensen from
Brondby in 1992, also handled by Mr Hauge, in which the Danish club
claims it kept only #900,000, against the #1,570,000 paid by Arsenal.
Again, #739,433 was paid to Interclub and #285,000 by bank transfer to
an account in Guernsey soon after Jensen arrived at Highbury.
Mr Graham has said he had ''not expected and not asked for'' either
payment and repaid the money to Arsenal in December last year.
The former manager, who took the Gunners to six major trophies in
eight years, believes this is his chance to clear his name and has
promised full co-operation with the FA.
So far, he is the only ''name'' projected by the ongoing Premier
League inquiry, which is not due to report again until September.
Outspoken former manager Tommy Docherty claimed yesterday: ''There is
so much being swept under the carpet while George is being made the
scapegoat.''
The hearing adjourned after more than seven hours but nobody was
giving any clues as to the state of play.

THE Government is to commission a #75,000 two-year research project in
an effort to help young Scots at risk.
The study was announced yesterday by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton,
Minister of State at the Scottish Office, when he addressed the
International Community Education Conference at Edinburgh University.
The research will examine the forms of youth work which are able to
attract young people who would not otherwise take part in community
education.
It will assess the success of youth work in reducing the likelihood of
young people's involvement in crime, delinquency, and other anti-social
behaviour.
The Minister said that, in the past 20 years, society had witnessed
unprecedented social, economic, and technological changes, many of which
had brought a range of benefits. Some groups, however, had been less
able to access these benefits, particularly among young people.
Lord James said great temptations were placed in the wayof young
people, one of which was drugs misuse -- ''a serious and escalating
problem in Scotland''.
''For the individual, drugs can provide a quick boost but this is at
the risk of prosecution, damage to health, a drift into destitution and,
in a significant and worrying number of cases, even death.''
He said projects under consideration at the conference were of vital
importance, offering young people at risk the opportunities for
education and training, employment, income maintenance and generation,
full legal status, and active citizenship.
The Minister told delegates there would be a conference in Scotland
later this year on the subject of child protection.
The aim of the conference would be to promote the development of
school-based strategies to help young people acquire the skills and
values they need to resist or avoid hazards such as abuse, bullying, and
harassment.

A PORTRAIT of Scottish athlete Eric Liddell never before seen in
public was unveiled at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in
Scotland yesterday.
Watched by four of his nieces, Scotland's current 400m European
champion Melanie Neef performed the honours on the 71st anniversary of
the athlete's world record-breaking run of 47.6sec in the 400m final at
the Paris Olympics of 1924.
Mr Liddell, whose story was told in the film Chariots of Fire, was
also remembered for his strong Christian beliefs. He pulled out of the
100m final -- which he was expected to win -- because it was being run
on a Sunday.
Mr James Holloway, depute to the Keeper of the Scottish National
Portrait Gallery, said the public had been askedfor suggestions about
great twentieth-century Scots unrepresented in the collection.
Mr Liddell emerged as one of the strong favourites but no trace of a
portrait of him could be found until the gallery received a telephone
call telling them a portrait of the athlete by artist Eileen Soper was
due for auction.
The auctioneers cut 10% from the #8500 price tag and also gave the
gallery the easel on which the portrait had sat.
Mr Holloway explained that the artist -- illustrator of the Enid
Blyton novels -- had been a friend of the family for many years.
Mr Liddell's nieces, Dr Peggy Judge, 68, Mrs Rosemary Wilson, 61, Mrs
Joan Nicol, 58, and Mrs Sue Caton, 46, said they were delighted to see
the portrait take its place in the gallery.

A 15-year-old Scarlet Pimpernel is still on the run after escaping
three times from social workers.
The boy, who has ''a considerable history'' of car theft, has cost
Strathclyde Regional Council #68,000 to keep him in a secure unit in
Bishopbriggs for 11 months. He was transferred to a school in Ayrshire,
where charges are approaching #10,000.
He has twice failed to appear in court on a charge of attempting to
steal petrol and a sheriff at Stirling yesterday issued a warrant for
his arrest.
The youth, described as a middle-class child from a broken home, first
gave care staff the slip last October.
He disappeared while on an outing from the secure unit before trying
to force open a locked pump at a garage in Fintry, Stirlingshire.
Then, despite his impending court appearance, social workers
authorised his transfer to the open surroundings of the school.
In addition to the sheriff court charges, the boy has been reported to
the children's panel 10 times for car theft in Stirlingshire and
Strathclyde, with six more cases outstanding.
A Strathclyde social work spokeswoman admitted the boy had repeatedly
gone missing.
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was not present when
his case came up at Stirling Sheriff Court in June because he had run
away.
He was found and returned to the school but, on Sunday night, he
disappeared again, the court heard yesterday when he had been due to
appear again.
Lawyers for the boy entered guilty pleas on his behalf to forcing open
the petrol pump at the Fintry Garage, Fintry, on October 3, and driving
a car without a licence or insurance, and failing to stop when ordered
to by police.
Sheriff Robert Younger agreed to a prosecution request for a warrant.
Last night, Conservative Councillor Marjorie Abel, who represents
Fintry, hit out at Strathclyde social work department for failing to
safeguard the public.
Councillor Abel, depute provost of Stirling district, said: ''This lad
has been allowed to abscond three times. You could forgive once but
three times is absolutely unacceptable.
''I think it merits an immediate inquiry into Strathclyde social work
department, because presumably the same people have been involved each
time.
''It's putting the public unacceptably at risk and it's wasting the
public's money.''
She added: ''When teenagers like this escape they always seem to head
for the wide open spaces and it makes rural communities feel very
vulnerable.''
A spokesman for the secure unit said: ''Very few youngsters get away
from the unit but this one escaped while on an outing. We can't take
children out in handcuffs.''
A spokeswoman for the social work department said: ''Residential
schools aren't prisons and the boy was being prepared to be returned to
the community.
''We'll be considering placing him in a secure unit again when he's
picked up.''
The boy's case will be considered by the Children's Panel in Glasgow
today.

A 45-YEAR-OLD Scot became the father of his own daughter's child, a
court heard yesterday.
Later he left his home in Kilmarnock and set up house in Dumfries with
his son's wife and her child. His daughter-in-law is now also pregnant,
the High Court in Ayr was told.
The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was jailed for seven
years. He had admitted a charge of incest which alleged that he had sex
with his daughter on various dates between March 1990 and November 1992,
as a result of which she gave birth in 1991.
Advocate-depute Valerie Stacey told Lord Gill that, as a result of the
affair, the daughter had undergone psychiatric treatment on a number of
occasions, and had overdosed twice.
The court heard that matters came to a head when the girl was stopped
for speeding. She told the police she was feeling low and useless and
was having thoughts about doing herself harm. She was detained in Ailsa
Hospital, Ayr, and later at Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock.
The daughter had been engaged, but the engagement was broken off. She
moved out of the family home and her father visited her -- sometimes
drunk -- with sex taking place as often as once a week. Sex sometimes
took place also when she visited the family home.
When her pregnancy was confirmed her father said she should sort the
matter out and not tell anyone that he was the father. He continued to
have sex with her. She told her mother that the father of her child was
someone she had met at a disco.
Mr Gary Allaum, for the accused, said there had been complete
dislocation of family relationships as a result of what he called a
''tragic case''. His client had had no contact with the family since the
situation came to light. He added: ''It is unlikely they will ever be
repaired. That is the penalty he fears most.''
Jailing the man, Lord Gill told him: ''The psychological consequences
on your daughter have been ghastly.''

A BUTCHER was found sitting in his home beside his dying son, a murder
trial at the High Court in Glasgow was told yesterday.
Mr Patrick Harte, 47, was naked from the waist up and was smeared with
dried blood. His son, also Patrick, 21, lay beside him with his throat
cut.
Members of the jury were told that photographs of the deceased were
''too horrific'' to be shown to them.
Mr Harte Sr, who owns a butcher's shop in Shawlands, denies murdering
his son by repeatedly stabbing him with a carving knife about the neck
and body.
The court was told how an ambulance controller took a frantic call for
help from the Harte's home at Midlothian Drive, Shawlands, Glasgow, in
February last.
Ms Denise McDonald told Advocate-depute Bill Dunlop, prosecuting, how
she answered an emergency call.
She said: ''A woman said there was an intruder in the house.
''She said, 'He's going to die. There's a boy dying. His guts are
lying out. He broke into the house. Send someone quick'.''
Ambulancemen found Mr Patrick Harte Jr, lying with a massive neck
wound and with his throat cut, they later recovered a missing finger cut
from the dead man.
Trainee ambulanceman Stephen Rutherford, 28, told the court: ''There
was not a lot we could do and we took him to hospital.''
Constable Stewart Townsley, 40, told how he found murder accused
Patrick Harte Sr sitting next to his dying son.
''He was smelling of drink and his son was lying on the bottom step
beside him,'' he said.
There were no signs of a break-in to the house.
The trial before Lord Milligan continues.

THE logo of Scottish Woodlands Ltd resembles the non-native sitka
spruce tree -- in the shape of a pound sign. Last year, the company's
pre-tax profits were #1,062,403, up 68%. The shareholders' dividend was
41p, up 32%.
It is the largest manager of Scottish forestry land for owners who
live and work abroad and has close connections with the Danish-based
Jensen Foundation, managing all its lands in Scotland.
The Edinburgh-based firm, with a turnover of #20m, has clients in
Austria, Belgium, Germany, Holland, and Sweden, and is also involved in
managing sporting estates for absentee lairds. It regularly sends an
investment manager to Hong Kong to secure more business.
Core businesses include tree planting and timber harvesting, including
the sitka, popular for yielding valuable wood. The firm is also heavily
involving in buying lands and forests for clients and in consultancy
work on the industry and environmental issues. Its chairman is Mr Hamish
Leslie Melville, who is also chairman of the National Trust for
Scotland.
Managing director Robin Adam insisted that Scotland should have no
concerns about the Danes moving in because they were interested in
forestry, conservation, amenity, and public access issues.
They were also ''meticulously creating'' well-run forestry
enterprises, with input from Scottish Natural Heritage, the RSPB, and
local authorities. All were long-term projects and would prove
beneficial to local communities. Several sites had important wildlife
reserves and the owners acted accordingly.
Scottish Woodlands, based at Heriot-Watt University's research park at
Riccarton, manages 135,000 hectares. It employs 80 staff and has offices
in England, Ireland, and Wales.
Last year, the total volume of timber handled increased by 35%, to
531,000 cubic metres. New planting increased by 104% to 4430 hectares,
and replanting increased by 58% to 668 hectares.

SEVEN centuries after being routed in the Battle of Largs, the Vikings
are slowly but surely returning to regain Scottish lands.
Despite Scotland's lack of a proper land register, Herald inquiries
have uncovered an impressive list of Scandinavian owners, from
Kirkcudbright to Sutherland, whose total land mass is well over 100,000
acres. The list is growing all the time.
Those involved in takeovers include Denmark's largest, most wealthy --
and publicity shy -- foundation and the giant Danish Lego foundation,
and range from aristocrats to individuals who want to own a piece of
Scotland.
Even governments are involved. Securum, a limited company wholly owned
by the Swedish Government, is in possession of an estate at Knockdow,
Argyll -- where #400,000 in grants for tree planting have been made
available by the Forestry Commission.
The SNP is to turn the question of who owns Scotland into a major
issue in the build-up to the next General Election following concerns
about land ownership, tenure, and lack of Government controls.
The ultimate irony of the Vikings' return is that no foreigners could
get away with such land grabs in their own countries. In Denmark, for
example, property laws prevent people buying land or houses unless they
work or have lived there for five years.
Fear of losing this exclusion clause in an enlarged European Union was
a principal contributory factor behind the country's No vote in the
Maastricht referendum.
Denmark, whose people number the same as the Scots, was terrified of
being swamped in property markets by neighbouring Germany and by the
thought of little-used holiday cottages sterilising the countryside. It
voted Yes the second time around after retaining rights of control over
its land and assets.
However, Danes have no such qualms about being absentee landlords in
Scotland or elsewhere; they can even offset borrowings on property
abroad against income at home, mitigating their ''liabilities'' even
when owning a Highland sporting estate solely for pleasure.
Their interests are far reaching, from Highland sporting estates to
Lowland forests and everything in between.
A major player is the Danish-based Aage V Jensens Fonde -- the Jensen
Foundation -- whose main purpose is cited as the preservation and
protection of nature and wildlife.
It appears secretive about operations. A request for a face-to-face
interview in Copenhagen to explain its growing interests in Scotland was
flatly rejected.
Its chief forester, Lars Moller Nielson, refused to say just how much
the foundation is prepared to spend buying up Scottish real estate. He
would neither confirm nor deny that it has around #150m to spend in
international purchases.
Meanwhile, Edinburgh-based Scottish Woodlands Ltd merely acknowledged
it had ''heard'' of the Jensen Foundation. It did not volunteer the fact
that it manages Jensen properties in Scotland but did offer a glowing
testimony in general of Danish ownership and stewardship of property in
Scotland.
Even Danish journalists said that they were in the dark about the
foundation, which owns several Danish islands, four areas of Scotland
and other foreign assets, notably in Greenland. They said it was
Denmark's biggest and most wealthy international foundation but little
had been written about it other than recording it spent money ''to
protect the environment''.
Foundation money has also paid for farmer Dorte Christensen, daughter
of the late founder, to take over Rona, a 2345-acre island in the Inner
Hebrides, where Highland cattle were to be reintroduced and derelict
buildings renovated as holiday cottages.
The Government's fisheries and agriculture department received
#265,000 in 1993 for the island, whose last permanent inhabitant had
left in 1943.
The foundation owns 9650-acre Claonaig at Kintyre, Argyll; Comer, near
Ben Lomond; has land at Invertrossachs, Loch Venacher, Stirlingshire,
and around 1800 acres at Margree, Dalry, Kirkcudbrightshire -- a
commercial forest.
Despite purporting to champion conservation causes, it has failed to
escape controversy. The 1992 purchase of Claonaig, which is historic as
well as beautiful, in particular raised hackles over environmental
issues, regardless of Scottish Natural Heritage involvement in
foundation projects to improve lochs and rivers and enhance the flora
and wildlife.
Local opposition to tree-planting proposals at Claonaig included
allegations of damage to water courses and fish stocks and loss of open
moorland. It was also claimed that benefits to the local community and
economy would be non-existent.
The Forestry Commission finally approved a scheme for planting mixed
woodlands last year, after modifications to preserve breathtaking views
across to Arran and Jura and to take account of wildlife concerns.
Scottish Woodlands had applied to plant around 35% of the estate over a
10 to 20-year period.
Opposition involved the percentage of sitka spruce to be planted;
fears of acid contamination of water; loss of open farmland and
moorland, and loss of tourist amenity.
Mr Nielsen said the foundation did not normally give interviews to the
press. It preferred instead to get on quietly with its job of protecting
nature and wildlife.
There was no need to highlight its work because the foundation had
nothing to sell and publicity about its finances led only to ''piles of
letters asking for money''.
Jensen's was funded in 1988, its riches based on money left by a
master carpenter to trade who rose from a poor background to make
millions from building commercial and residential properties.
Mr Nielsen said the foundation's interest in Scotland lies in its
remaining one of Europe's most remote and unpolluted areas, with
long-term opportunities to preserve wildlife and habitat.
He acknowledged commercial forestry interests but argued that the
foundation was concerned mainly with trying to improve the wildlife in
such areas. Current studies at Margree involve planting species that
will encourage animals, insects, and flowers.
He added that the issue of foreign ownership was political and
declined to comment other than argue that the Danes ''lived and thought
like the Scots . . . they understood each other, did not try to change
everything overnight''.
Mr Nielsen said the foundation was co-operating with Scottish National
Heritage, the RSPB, and other interested bodies to protect wildlife and
nature.
It was impossible for Danes to buy land at home on the scale available
in Scotland. Some were here to invest in commercial forestry, and others
for pleasure, including owning sporting estates with shooting and
fishing.
The Scandinavians' largest single Scottish tract covers the
60,000-acre prime estate of Strathconan, which lies about 30 miles west
of Inverness and is regarded as one of the most scenic in the Highlands.
It was bought in March by the family which runs the Lego corporation
after group chairman Kjeld Kirk Christiansen arranged a private visit to
Scotland last year in a bid to buy land, its first outwith Denmark.
The purchase price, undisclosed, was met by Kirkbi A/S, a holding
company which is wholly owned by the Christiansen family which last year
was outbid when trying to take over the Glenfeshie estate in the
Cairngorms.
Kirkbi's objective is to continue the estate's forestry, stalking, and
fishing activities ''on a conservationist basis'' and in a way ''which
supports the social and economic wellbeing of the local community''.
It intended to manage the estate in line with Scottish Natural
Heritage's philosophy on the care and preservation of the environment.
Strathconan, previously owned by the Macdonald-Buchanan family, boasts
several Munros, 4000 acres of forest, and two sites of special
scientific interest.
Locals' optimism that the family has the environment at heart is
tinged with sadness that a Scottish buyer was not found; they are
keeping an eye on future development.
Other Danish interests, mainly in forestry land, include the Horsens
Folkebland Foundation whose 2000-acre Revack estate/forest at Nethy
Bridge, Inverness-shire, is also managed by Scottish Woodlands Ltd;
Lucas Aardenburg, with 10,800 acres at Pitmain, Kingussie; Carl
Lawaetz, 9600 acres at East Benula, Strathcannich, Inverness-shire --
which is currently on the market; Neils Tandrup, with 6700 acres at
Glencrispesdale;
TAP AG, with 1000 acres at Achany, Lairg; Niels Mikklesson and Henrick
Orskov, 600 acres at Ruskich, Glen Lyon; and P Meyrick, who has 400-acre
Balnabeeran Woodlands at Torness, Inverness-shire. Balnacraig at
Aberfeldy, Perthshire, is in the hands of Sofaelde Scov-OG
Ejendomsselskag A/S.
Danish count Adam Knuth, of Knuthenborg, owns the 24,500-acre Ben
Loyal estate near Tongue, Sutherland, said to boast one of the largest
North County Cheviot sheep flocks in the UK.
Edinburgh-based selling agents Savills confirmed there has been ''a
massive influx'' of Danes to Scotland in recent years, although success
in the Scandinavian market was subject to exchange rates.
Selling agents Strutt and Parker said the Danes were very interested
in forestry, farming, and outdoor pursuits. They could be ''seduced by
scale'', with the acreages in Scotland not available at home.

LAND ownership issues in the Highlands will be given a high profile by
the new Highland Council, convener Peter Peacock has pledged.
The new council has already set up a Lands Issues Working Group but
the present authority may reactivate its land committee, which has lain
dormant since the region's elections last year.
Mr Peacock said he has found in meetings throughout the Highlands that
land ownership was ''a key issue'' and one the new authority will treat
''very seriously''.
His promise followed veteran councillor Sandy Russell's protests over
a lack of definitive policy on land sales.
But for that, argued Councillor Russell, the Highlands might not now
be seeing ''the sale of one of the oldest family estates in the
Highlands -- and seeing it being broken up into parcels and sold to
people who come from abroad''.
He was referring to the sale of the #6m, 19,500-acre Lovat estate near
Beauly, Inverness-shire, which has attracted interest from the UK,
Europe, and further afield. The estate is likely to be broken up and
sold to a number of buyers.
Councillor Russell said the council must get more involved in the
allocation of land. Times had moved on and, although the subject had not
much support in the past, there was ''a new spirit abroad'' among the
new councillors. Constructive land policies were needed.
Development committee chairman Jimmy Munro agreed: ''We have tried to
take action over the land question for the past 20 years and many
councillors have not been interested. The Lovat estate has some of the
best lands in the Highlands and if it falls into foreign hands -- as now
seems likely -- the land will probably go to waste.''
Their comments follow SNP leader Alex Salmond's declaration to turn
the question of who owns land in Scotland into a major issue in the
run-up to the next General Election.
The party, increasingly concerned about absentee ownership, has tabled
a series of Commons questions on land ownership. They were put down by
MP Roseanna Cunningham, the SNP's environment spokesperson, after
reports that the UK Government has approved #400,000 in tree-planting
grants to a Swedish government-owned company which has land in Argyll.
Ms Cunningham wants the Scottish Secretary to number and name the
foreign-owned companies which own estates in Scotland and name the
foreign-owned companies which have been paid Government grants to plant
trees in Scotland in the past five years.
She believes the fact that a comprehensive register of who owns the
land, and how they use it, has not been completed is ''an example of the
near-feudal nature of Scots land law''.
The rights of crofters and the issue of land ownership reform have
already been raised at the United Nations' commission on sustainable
development.
According to the Assynt Crofters' Trust, which attended the meeting,
delegates from other EU countries were astonished that large tracts of
land could be bought and sold with no community involvement

A DRINK-driver is facing jail for causing a crash in a car he won in a
game of pool.
James Brown, 42, of Albyn Court, Nairn, who is serving a five-year ban
for drink-driving, admitted careless driving and causing a collision on
the Inverness to Nairn road on June 10, when he appeared at Inverness
Sheriff Court yesterday.
A motorist behind Brown on the A96 saw him veering erratically into
the path of vehicles.
The man flashed his lights to warn traffic but two cars coming in
opposite directions collided side-on as Brown sped away, the court
heard.
Brown then drew up at traffic lights but drove through a red light
when another driver got out and urged him to give himself up.
Brown admitted failing to stop after an accident, failing to stop at a
red light, failing to take breath and blood tests at Nairn police
station, and driving without insurance.
A defence agent said Brown, who is unemployed, had ''won a car in a
game of pool -- that was the only reason he drove that day''.
Brown, who admitted three previous convictions, was served a 15-month
ban from February 1983 for a serious road traffic offence. He was banned
for five years in November 1992 for drink-driving.
Sheriff Donald Booker-Milburn deferred sentence for one week for a
medical assessment of Brown's suitability for prison.
* A chief engineer with Bristow Helicopters, which operates the
Stornoway coastguard helicopter service, was fined #350 and banned from
driving for 18 months when he appeared at Stornoway Sheriff Court
yesterday.
Robert Winters, 58, of Goathill Road, Stornoway, admitted driving with
an excess of alcohol at Parkend, near Stornoway, on March 24.
Agent Ken Macdonald said his client had been chief engineer with
Bristow at Stornoway but had been moved to Aberdeen and effectively
demoted because of the offence.
* Celebrations to mark a first grandchild cost a lorry driver #150 and
a two-year ban at Haddington Sheriff Court yesterday for drink-driving.
Ian Garrow, 46, of Hillswick Walk, South Sheddocksley, Aberdeen,
admitted being over the drink-drive limit when stopped by police for
driving his heavy goods vehicle on the A1 Edinburgh-Newcastle road near
Haddington, East Lothian, on June 20.
* A Glasgow woman suffering from the after effects of a party crashed
into a caravan, Kilmarnock Sheriff Court was told yesterday. Brenda
Keaveney, 31, of Fulton St, Knightwood, pled guilty to five charges.
She admitted that on June 25 at Sandilands Caravan Park in Saltcoats,
she took her sister-in-law's car without permission; drove without a
licence and without insurance; drove carelessly so that she collided
with the parked caravan; and that she drove with a breath alcohol level
of 104 mgs.
Keaveney was fined #500 and banned from driving for two years.
* Quality control officer Thomas Weir drank six or seven bottles of
lager before driving over the centre of a roundabout while two police
cars were travelling in the opposite direction, Dumbarton Sheriff Court
was told yesterday.
Weir, 40, of Cloberhill Road, Glasgow, admitted being almost three
times over the limit on Great Western Boulevard, Clydebank. He was fined
#700 and banned from driving for 18 months.

MR DAVID DOUGLAS, a distinguished reporter with The Glasgow Herald for
many years, has died in retirement in Fife. He was 88.
Mr Douglas was chief reporter in The Herald's Edinburgh office in the
period after the Second World War and was responsible for organising
coverage and criticism of Edinburgh International Festival.
A former colleague recalled yesterday that he wrote a brilliant series
of pen portraits of festival personalities.
Mr Douglas later served as a leader writer and feature writer but, as
an all-round reporter, continued to cover the Scottish Office and all
important stories in Edinburgh.
He covered the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for many
years and sometimes recalled what had happened at assemblies back to the
Union of the Churches in 1929. When he retired in 1971, he was publicly
thanked by the Moderator, the Very Rev Dr Andrew Herron.
Mr Douglas had formerly served as a general reporter in Glasgow with
The Herald, before moving to Edinburgh.
His wife, Betty, predeceased him. He is survived by two daughters.

AN assault charge against a man who floored an alleged thief with a
flying rugby tackle has been dropped, the police and Crown Prosecution
Service said yesterday.
A CPS spokesman said there was not enough evidence for a ''realistic
prospect of conviction''.
Mr Russell Burrows, 28, of Sharnford, Leicestershire, raced 50 yards
to grab the man after he allegedly saw him breaking into a neighbour's
garage after midnight.
Police arrested a 21-year-old man and charged him with burglary --
then charged Mr Mr Burrows after the man made a complaint.
Leicestershire Police said: ''With regard to the case in which a
28-year-old Sharnford man was charged with common assault, the CPS has
reviewed the full facts of the case and decided there was insufficient
reliable evidence for the case to proceed.
''In accordance with normal policy, we will be writing to the
individual concerned to inform him that the case will be discontinued
and the CPS will formally notify him in due course.''
Russell had earlier told the press: ''I feel sick. When the police
said I was charged with common assault, I thought it was a joke. But I
was taken off for finger-printing and photographed for my police
mugshots. I felt like Hugh Grant.
''All I did was catch a thief. I knocked him over and just held on. He
wasn't even injured.''
Neighbour Mrs Margaret Wright, 51, who owns the garage, said after
hearing the news: ''I'm very pleased. He shouldn't have been charged in
the first place. They have these action watches, and things like that,
and when somebody does the good citizen thing, they're put in the wrong
for it.''

THE Unemployment Unit, an independent research organisation, today
criticises the Government's Jobseekers' Allowance legislation as
''mean-spirited''.
The attack is published in the unit's monthly journal and has been
backed by Opposition politicians in Scotland.
Unemployment benefit and income support are to be replaced by the new
allowance. It cuts entitlement to non means-tested benefit from one year
to six months, reduces help for the jobless with mortgage repayments,
and introduces measures to help people find work.
Mr Paul Convery, director of the Unemployment Unit, said: ''What a
mean-spirited piece of legislation this really is. More than a quarter
of a million people will be worse off -- including 70,000 who will get
no benefit at all.''
Ms Anne McNair, SNP employment spokeswoman, said: ''Claimants would be
better off if the Government scrapped these damaging proposals
altogether.''
The Jobseekers' Allowance legislation has received royal assent and
will be implemented between April and October next year.

A SCOTTISH soldier shot himself dead in his barracks while on a tour
of duty in Northern Ireland.
It is believed Private Scott Harrington shot himself minutes after
receiving a telephone call from a friend or relative.
Private Harrington, 25, of Craigpark Circle, Ellon, Aberdeenshire, was
found dead at Ebrington Barracks, Londonderry, where he was six months
into a two-year tour of duty with the 1st Battalion, The Highlanders
regiment.
An Army spokeswoman said yesterday there would be a full internal
inquiry. She confirmed he had died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds to
the head.
His parents, Maureen and Alistair, had the news broken to them by an
officer from the regimental headquarters in Aberdeen.
They said their son, who has a brother, Craig, 22, and sister Kirsty,
18, had joined the Army after leaving school. But a friend said he had
been unsettled in the Army and had been planning to leave next year.

THE crackdown on benefit fraud saved the taxpayer a record #717.6m
last year. This was #64m ahead of target and the majority came from
detecting more than 392,000 cases of people cheating the benefits
system.
Social security fraud covers a wide spectrum from people
misrepresenting the facts to claim benefit to organised gangs of
criminals.
No benefit is free from abuse, but the main areas of fraud are centred
on income-related benefits such as income support, housing benefit,
administered by local authorities, and short-term payments such as
unemployment benefit and incapacity benefit.

THE trend towards Scottish councillors becoming full-time
professionals will be hastened if the new unitary authorities follow the
advice in a report published yesterday.
After the disclosures that many senior councillors in future will be
paid proper salaries of up to #24,000 a year, the report by the Scottish
Local Government Information Unit calls for them all to be given better
and more professional help to carry out their duties.
This would include secretarial support, training and access to new
technology.
The unit says the number of councillors has fallen from 1695 to 1245
because of reorganisation but their workload will increase. In future,
they will have to concentrate on setting out strategy and policy and
improving the way they monitor council performance.
A survey found that there were was a considerable difference in the
level of support services provided by different authorities, with the
larger ones offering more in terms of staff, equipment and office
accomodation.
The convener of the information unit, Councillor Jean McFadden said it
was very important that the new unitary councils provided their members
with the level of support services that would allow them to represent
their constituents effectively and take on the important task of
creating the policy and structures of the new councils in a professional
manner.
She emphasised that, in particular, councillors would require
additional advice and support to represent their authority on outside
bodies and joint boards and to monitor the new water authorities and
other quangos.
The report, Helping Councillors to be Effective, suggests every
council should have a members' services unit and a budget for training,
development programmes and research facilities for members.

Brussels,
THE European Union yesterday signalled fresh determination to create a
single currency when it threatened sanctions against member states which
fail to meet conditions for participation.
Spain, Portugal and Greece were outvoted when the issue came before
economic and finance Ministers in Brussels. ''We have made it clear
there are teeth to this procedure,'' British Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
told reporters later, after voting with the majority.
Mr Clarke, a leading Cabinet European, dodged suggestions from
reporters that he must soon decide whether the new impetus for a single
currency meant he must re-enter the pound in the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The Spanish -- holders of the rotating EU presidency, and whose
finance Minister, Mr Pedro Solbes, chaired yesterday's talks -- are
major recipients of EU aid along with Portugal and Greece. With Ireland,
they form the EU's so-called ''cohesion'' states, the poorest in the
Community, in receipt of #12 bn over five years until the end of 1997.
The money is intended to help their economies become strong enough to
join a single currency by the end of the century. Ireland's has so far
improved enough to make it one of only three EU economies currently
meeting the criteria for joining a single currency as laid down in the
Maastricht treaty. The others are Germany and Luxembourg.
However, if the others fail to make the grade, they will now face
having their cohesion funding withheld by the European Commission. The
issue provoked a row behind the scenes yesterday when Mr Solbes
diplomatically played down Spanish indignation by saying it all boiled
down to a matter of interpretation of Maastricht.
Mr Clarke dodged questions about whether the Tories would make their
decision on joining a single currency known in a General Election
manifesto. The EU's steady progress towards economic and monetary union
(Emu)is seen as putting pressure on the Government to decide whether the
time has come to rejoin the ERM.
Under the Maastricht timetable for Emu, all currencies wishing to join
must have been within the ERM's fluctuation limits for two years. This
means that the pound should in theory be back in the grid -- from which
it was expelled on Black Wednesday three years ago -- at the start of
1997.
This places the Government in a dilemma, since a decision to rejoin
the ERM would be interpreted as Britain wanting to be part of a single
currency. A decision to stay out could indicate that Britain was
forfeiting any chance of playing a significant part in critical
policy-making before monetary authority is transferred to Frankfurt in
1999.
However, some senior British observers pointed out last night that
Britain's economic performance under Mr Clarke had already put the
economy on course for meeting the Maastricht criteria.
''What matters is whether the economy is performing to the criteria --
not whether we are actually in the ERM. If Britain meets the criteria
outside the ERM there is no chance the others would stop us joining,''
one British official remarked. ''They would never turn down the chance
of British participation if our figures showed we were ready for it.''
Politically the timing is awkward for Mr Major. He must go to the
polls not later than the spring of 1997, shortly after the deadline for
rejoining the ERM. It seems less likely as time goes on that the
Conservatives can continue to fudge a decision on joining in Emu,
especially as the temperature is rising on the issue in the rest of
Europe.
One solution could be an early General Election. Another could be a
referendum. Mr Michael Heseltine's increased influence in Cabinet could
be decisive. He is backed by Mr Clarke in resisting a referendum, saying
the issue should be decided by Parliament. Mr Major has sounded
equivocal on the referendum question.
The Chancellor chided reporters for suggesting there was still a split
on Europe in the new Cabinet. ''These stories of differing views should
start petering out now, I should have thought,'' he said.

THE days when trade union leaders had an ''armlock'' on Labour
policies are gone and would not be coming back, Labour leader Tony Blair
told the Transport and General Workers' Union yesterday.
In a blunt and bold address to the Blackpool conference of the TGWU --
the largest party affiliate and his own sponsoring union -- Mr Blair
made his strongest declaration yet that he would continue modernising
the relationship between the party and the unions.
He chided the union's general secretary, Mr Bill Morris, for dwelling
on that relationhsip in his eve-of-conference briefing when he should
have been telling the world what the union was doing for its members.
He would not get involved in ''ritual fan-dance,'' he said, before
launching into a no-nonsense explanation of his continuing drive for
modernisation.
There was little new in it, other than the intensity with which it was
delivered, but after 45 minutes laced with reaffirmation of items a
Labour Government would deliver, he won over most of the 700 delegates.
After a relatively cool reception, they eventually gave him a standing
ovation. Only Merseyside delegates and some from Scotland remained
seated.
Mr Blair's began by saying that there was a time when large trade
unions would pass policy and it was assumed Labour would follow; when
demands were made, and Labour responded.
Those days were now over and gone, never to return, he said. Unions
would be listened to, as would employers, but neither would have an
armlock on Labour which would seek to be a government for the whole
nation.
It was important that this was understood, he said, adding that no-one
should believe any nonsense about this being anti-trade union.
The new relationship, where it was recognised that interests could
differ as well as coincide, did not rupture the links or mean the party
had turned its back on the unions.
The trade union share of votes at the party conference would reduce to
50% as a result of large recruitment of individual members, and this
should be celebrated.
Later, Mr Blair refused to give any assurances that the union vote
would not fall further -- a fear that Mr Morris had drawn attention to
at the weekend.
On the introduction of a national minimum wage -- another flashpoint
for Labour and several unions, including the TGWU -- Mr Blair warned
that it would be counter-productive to attempt to tie Labour to a figure
or an inflexible formula. It would send precisely the wrong message to
the country.
Mr Morris had said earlier that the union would be demanding #4.15 a
hour from employers -- something the conference is expected to reaffirm
today.
Before leaving to campaign in the Saddleworth by-election, Mr Blair
described his reception by the TGWU delegates as very good.
Mr Morris declared himself ''very comfortable'' with the Labour
leader's speech which he said had received, a very warm reception from
almost all of the delegates.
Meanwhile, the President of the Board of Trade, Mr Ian Lang, yesterday
accused the Labour leader of conducting a ''phoney'' war with the three
big unions, the TGWU, GMB and Unison over a minimum wage.
He said: ''They want to put a firm figure of #4.15 on it. At the last
General Election, Mr Blair was happy to oblige. Three year later, he
refuses. Why? Because he does not want the voters to know that Labour is
signed up to a policy which, on recent estimates, could cost up to
1,500,000 jobs.
''So he fudges the issue. He says a future Labour Government would
look at the evidence and consult with -- you guessed it -- trade unions,
before getting a figure.''

SOCIAL Security Secretary Peter Lilley yesterday announced a fresh
crackdown on benefit fraud as new figures showed that fraudulent claims
for income support and unemployment benefit cost the taxpayer #1400m a
year.
On the basis that ''prevention is better than detection,'' he gave
details of four new strategies for protecting the benefit system against
abuse.
These include:
* The introduction of benefit payment cards so that better records can
be kept.
* About one million extra targeted checks a year, including more home
visits when new claims are made.
* More cross-checking of information held on internal DSS databases.
* A major new investment in information technology.
Mr Lilley's announcement coincided with a Labour-initiated Commons
debate in which the Government's approach to social and economic policy
was angrily attacked by Shadow Social Security spokesman Donald Dewar.
He condemned policies which, he said, had widened social division, led
to damaging inequality and insecurity.
Mr Dewar claimed that last week's abolition of the Department of
Employment signalled a complete lack of Government concern about
unemployment, insecurity at work, and skill shortages.
The background to Mr Lilley's announcement was two internal reports to
his department's Fraud Strategy Board, one of which showed that, on
income support and unemployment benefit, one in 10 claims were
fraudulent and people working while claiming accounted for the biggest
fraud losses -- #560m.
The other report showed that crackdown on benefit fraud saved
taxpayers a record #717.6m last year, but Mr Lilley is determined to do
better -- hence yesterday's announcement.
He said: ''Social security exists to help people in need. Every pound
lost to fraud is a pound less for those in real need. That is why I have
made the battle against fraud a priority. We have been increasingly
successful, but prevention is better than cure.
''I have been developing a new strategy which makes a quantum leap
from detection to preventing and deterring fraud.
''As far as possible, I want to stamp it out. In the past, our efforts
have been hampered by ignorance of how much fraud there is and what
kinds. At last I have developed a means of measuring the extent of
fraud, which will also enable us to measure future success in reducing
it.''
Mr Dewar gave a measured response to Mr Lilley's announcement, stating
that Labour was opposed to social security fraud in all its forms, and
that the victims were those entitled to benefit and the long-suffering
taxpayer. ''It is the duty of Government to strike at abuse wherever it
is found,'' he said.
He supported the steps to increase home visits, but said these should
look not only for abuse but for entitlement to unclaimed benefits.
Mr Dewar added: ''The public should know that it is this Government
which cut home visits year by year as a convenient way of saving money.
Mr Lilley should blush as he now describes such visits as the front-line
weapon against fraud.''
The Labour spokesman saved much of his fire for the debate, in which
he deplored the ''social divide'' -- with particular attention paid to
the earnings of senior executives of public utilities -- and argued that
it was essential for the Government to take action which promoted
employment opportunities, particularly for the long-term unemployed.
For the Government, Mr Lilley welcomed what he claimed was an increase
of 38% in average incomes and a rise in spending of all income groups
since 1979, and said the United Kingdom had fewer people claiming
unemployment benefits -- and more jobs -- than any other European
country.
Closing last night's debate for the Government, the new Secretary of
State for the combined departments of Education and Employment, Mrs
Gillian Shephard, strongly defended the merger and accused Labour of
being out of touch.
She claimed the merger, which had been welcomed by many organisations,
would lead to greater co-operation between education and business, and
would be a move towards ending the ''false division'' between academic
and vocational qualifications.
Labour's motion was defeated by 299 votes to 230, a Government
majority of 69.

Vatican City, Monday
POPE John Paul today issued one of his strongest defences of women's
rights in society and he apologised for the Roman Catholic Church's past
role in the oppression of women.
But, in a 19-page letter to women, he also reaffirmed his unbending
stand against women priests in the Church, saying it was justified by
the gospel.
Even dissident Catholics welcomed the letter. A major group which
usually criticises the Pope called it very helpful.
''I'm astonished,'' said Frances Kissling, president of the US-based
Catholics for a Free Choice.
''This is largely a helpful document on the secular level and a good
expression of women's rights.''
The Pope said that while those who have an abortion after a rape
committed a ''grave sin'', the primary blame should be placed squarely
on men and society.
He said that, although the modern feminist movement had made its share
of mistakes, it had been ''a substantially positive one''. But much more
had to be done ''to prevent discrimination against those who have chosen
to be wives and mothers''.
The unprecedented letter, which the Pope addressed ''to each one of
you as a sign of solidarity and gratitude'', was issued ahead of the UN
Conference on Women in Beijing in September.
In a section of the letter that read almost like a manifesto of
women's rights, the 75-year-old Polish pontiff said:
''As far as personal rights are concerned, there is an urgent need to
achieve real equality in every area: equal pay for equal work,
protection for working mothers, fairness in career advancements,
equality of spouses with regard to family rights and the recognition of
everything that is part of the rights and duties of a citizen in a
democratic state.''
He continued: ''This is a matter of justice but also of necessity.
Women will increasingly play a part in the solution of the serious
problems of the future . . . ''
He said that history had conditioned society and often put up many
obstacles to the progress of women.
''And if objective blame, especially in particular historical
contexts, has belonged to not just a few members of the Church, for this
I am truly sorry,'' he said.
The Pope did not elaborate, but Cardinal Eduardo Pironio told a news
conference at the Vatican that the pontiff was referring to the fact
that the Church had in the past blocked women from positions short of
the priesthood now open to them.
The Pope said sexual violence against women had to stop.--Reuter.

United Nations, Monday
SECRETARY-GENERAL Boutros Boutros-Ghali today welcomed the release
from house arrest of Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and said
he hoped it would be a step towards the establishment of a multi-party
system in her country.
A statement read by UN spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said the Burmese
government informed the secretary-general, who is now visiting Greece,
of its decision to lift restrictions imposed on the 50-year-old Nobel
laureate nearly six years ago.
''He welcome this development as an important step, which he hopes
will be followed by others, towards the establishment of a multi-party
system in Myanmar (Burma).''
The spokesman said Boutros-Ghali would report to the General Assembly
opening in September on the implementation of a mandate the assembly
gave him last December to continue discussions with the Burmese
government aimed at restoring democracy and promoting national
reconciliation.
Suu Kyi is married to Oxford University academic Dr Michael Aris and
efforts were being made to contact him. The couple have two sons.
Her unexpected release shows the confidence Burma's military rulers
have in their hold on power but it is too early to gauge the effect on
the embattled democracy movement, diplomats said.
''It's a bit puzzling, too good to be true. I just don't feel this is
real. I'd wait another two or three days before I rejoiced,'' said one
Bangkok-based diplomat monitoring developments in Burma.
Military officials of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration
Council (SLORC) said in Rangoon that Suu Kyi had been released
unconditionally after nearly six years of house arrest.
There was no announcement of her release on Burma's state-run media
but witnesses in Rangoon said groups of people who had apparently heard
the news by word of mouth gathered outside her house in the early
evening rain.
Suu Kyi was inside holding talks with pro-democracy colleagues, they
said.
Burma's southeast Asian neighbours, in particular Singapore, Malaysia
and Thailand, have been investing heavily in resource-rich Burma in
recent years.
The SLORC has effectively silenced all dissent, imprisoning virtually
everyone who dared speak out in opposition to military rule.
Diplomats said it was always possible she could be re-arrested if the
SLORC thought that her actions posed a threat.
The SLORC has insisted that a new constitution currently being drawn
up under its supervision would guarantee the military a leading role in
politics.
The London-based human rights group Amnesty International welcomed her
release but pointed out that hundreds of political prisoners remained
locked up.
The daughter of the revered architect of Burma's independece from
Britain, General Aung San, Suu Kyi was swept to prominence during a 1988
uprising against miltary rule.
The National League for Democracy, which she co-founded, easily won a
1990 election despite the fact she was already under house arrest.

Union, South Carolina, Monday
THE double murder trial of a woman who has admitted killing her two
young sons began today with the judge dismissing more than a dozen
potential jurors because of prior jail sentences.
Susan Smith, 23, is charged with the October 25 drownings of
three-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex, by allowing her car to
roll into a lake with the children strapped in the back seat.
For nine days last year, Smith maintained that a black man in a
woollen cap had pulled her out of her car at a lonely intersection and
driven off into the night with the two toddlers in the back seat.
But a national manhunt for the kidnapper turned up nothing and
suspicions about Smith's credibility grew as she made a series of
nationally televised appeals for information that contained much
emotional language but no tears.
Authorities announced her arrest on November 3 and her written
confession was later released by police.
The state wants to send the woman to the electric chair.
A separate hearing is expected to be held later today to determine
whether Smith is mentally competent to stand trial, a court
administrator said.
By midday, Judge William Howard had dismissed 36 potential jurors,
leaving 111 jury candidates. Fifteen were excused because they had been
convicted of crimes punishable by more than a year in jail.
The trial is taking place in a tight-knit southern community of 10,000
people where church bells ring at noon and merchants work only a half
day on Wednesdays. Smith is well-known in town, selected the
''friendliest senior'' in the Union High School Class of 1989.
The lake where the children died has become something of a shrine. An
enlarged picture of Michael and Alex is mounted above a toy helicopter,
police car, fire truck, stuffed animals and a cap marked
''Mini-Trotters: World's Smallest Basketball Team'' at the lake.
Many people have been visiting the spot every day, standing silently
before the picture and gazing at the boat ramp from which Smith's
burgundy Mazda rolled into the lake with the children strapped into
their carseats. They stare at the dark waters and shake their heads in
disbelief.
Smith has recently been baptised and her minister said at the weekend
she was ready to accept punishment for the crimes.
''She has accepted responsibility for the death of her two children,''
said the Rev Mark Long, the Methodist minister of a church she joined
after the boys' deaths said. ''She knows that she will be punished and
she accepts that.''
The pastor also said Smith is more worried about the prospect of life
in prison than death in the electric chair.
The judge set aside two weeks for jury selection, a process
complicated by the fact that prosecutors need a unanimous decision on
the death penalty from a jury drawn from residents of Union County's
close-knit community.--Reuter.

Paris, Monday
IN a new embarrassment to France over its decision to resume nuclear
tests, Greenpeace said today that two of its activists had briefly
occupied the drilling rig on the French South Pacific testing site.
Briton Richard Laney and Australian Madeleine Habib scaled the rig and
remained on it for about 20 minutes yesterday before authorities removed
them, the environmental group said.
The rig is used to bore deep holes into the rock below the atoll in
which the French bombs will be exploded.
France intends to conduct eight tests on the atoll beginning in
September, President Jacques Chirac announced last month, triggering
widespread outrage in the South Pacific.
In a sign that further action was planned, Greenpeace said three of
the 30-odd activists who sailed its Rainbow Warrior flagship into a
12-mile exclusion zone around the atoll yesterday had gone missing in
the area.
One of the three was David McTaggart, the group's founder and honorary
chairman who first sailed into Mururoa in 1971 in protest at French
testing, they said.
''What we've shown is that we're capable of breaching the military
security of the nuclear test site,'' said Michael Szabo of the group's
New Zealand branch.
''We've demonstrated our ability to disrupt the testing programme and
we're still in a position to look at future activities which could
further disrupt the preparations.''
A reporter in Mururoa for French television's second channel said four
Greenpeace inflatable dinghies penetrated the French naval barrier
around Mururoa.
She said two were stopped before reaching shore but two others managed
to land militants ashore and some of them chained themselves to ground
installations.
The French defence ministry said it had no information on the
Greenpeace claims or the television report.
The environemtalists acted after about 150 French commandos rammed and
then forcibly boarded the Rainbow Warrior using teargas yesterday after
it entered the exclusion zone.
The forcible boarding came 10 years to the day after frogmen sent by
Paris blew up and sank Greenpeace's original Rainbow Warrior flagship in
Auckland harbour on July 10, 1985.
The French authorities took the activists to the atoll and detained
them for questioning for 10 hours before freeing them and towing them
out to sea.
The crew had no passports with them, and when questioned, all gave
their names as Fernando Pereira, the name of the Dutch-Portuguese
photographer killed when the French agents blew up the original Rainbow
Warrior.
Szabo said the activists had made no promise to end protests against
French plans to end a three-year testing moratorium.
After the forcible boarding, New Zealand and Australia called in
France's ambassadors to explain why the commando raid was required to
subdue so small a group of unarmed individuals.
New Zealand called the assault ''totally over the top'' while the
15-nation South Pacific Forum called it excessive and irrational.
''One could argue that they haven't done this very well. You would
have thought they might have been a bit more sensitive, both in the way
they did it and in the timing,'' said a diplomat from a major European
ally.
Shrugging off the critics, French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said the
assault was justified to ensure respect for the law.
''We do what is needed to assure that the law is respected and we will
continue to do so,'' Prime Minister Alain Juppe said.
''We acted in the gentlest possible manner. No arms were used,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux told reporters.
However, an activist aboard the Rainbow Warrior said French troops
manhandled the crew when they stormed the vessel.
''We were in the radio room and the commandos split open the door with
an axe and threw a teargas canister into the room, so we had to get out
of the porthole, which was a little bit nerve-racking,'' activist
Stephanie Mills told Sky Television.
The French daily Liberation, quoting anonymous defence ministry
officials, said France would not stop at the eight tests announced by
President Chirac but would conduct undetectable miniature tests even
after a global testing ban scheduled to take effect in mid-1996.
Asked about the report, Juppe said Paris would abide fully by the
constraints of the treaty to be signed next year.--Reuter.
* The French Consulate in Edinburgh today was targeted by Greenpeace
supporters who laid a wreath at its door to commemorate the 10th
anniversary of the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior.

European transport commissioner Neil Kinnock said in Brussels that the
EU was ''making progress'' with a law to make seat belts in buses
compulsory.
The EU and its member states have been working for several years on
plans to compel bus companies to provide passenger safety belts. Some
member states -- notably those in southern Europe -- have resisted the
idea, arguing that the need for bus seat belts is unproved and would be
too costly for the coach industry.
The Commission is working on a series of draft directives governing
belts and the consequent strengthening of the anchorage of seats in
buses. ''We also intend to ensure that the construction requirements of
buses and coaches will include specifications relating to the structural
integrity of the vehicle,'' Mr Kinnock said.
''These so-called 'type approval' specifications relate to minimum
requirements for the marketing of new coaches within the European Union.
Member states may adopt more rigorous requirements if they so wish.''
He added: ''All the necessary steps should be completed by the end of
the year, enabling the laws to be put into effect in all EU member
states by October, 1996.

THE Government faces another damaging ''sleaze'' row after a Commons
committee set up to respond to the Nolan report split along party lines.
Tory MPs on the select committee on standards in public life combined
with the lone Liberal Democrat member to block Labour demands for the
early implementation of curbs on outside consultancy work by MPs.
Instead, the committee recommended further work on the issue ''as a
matter of urgency,'' with a fresh report, if possible, before the new
session of Parliament starts in the autumn.
In another development last night, it was announced that Harrods
chairman Mohammad Al Fayed is to be summoned before the powerful Commons
Privileges Committee.
MPs are investigating the sending of a fax on Commons-headed notepaper
by the Guardian newspaper during an investigation into a stay at the
Paris Ritz by former Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken.
The decision to call Mr Al Fayed, who owns the Ritz, marked a victory
for Labour MPs on the committee who had been seeking to widen the scope
of the investigation.
A spokesman for Mr Al Fayed said: ''He would welcome the opportunity
to help the committee which, like himself, is dedicated to cleaning up
public life in this country.''
On the issue of MPs' conduct, Mr Major, who set up the Nolan
committee, is in difficulty because Tory MPs are reluctant to disclose
the extent of their earnings.
Next week, the Government is obliged to stage a Commons debate on the
issue.
The committee agrees that there should be a parliamentary
commissioner, the MPs' register of interests should be updated more
frequently, and MPs should be obliged to declare personal interests more
specifically in motions tabled and supplementary questions asked.
However, Labour said it was ''disappointed'' that the Conservatives
had not supported measures to force MPs to declare their earnings from
consultancy work and to ban them from working for consultancies with
more than one client.
Next week, Mr Major could try to force through more disclosure in the
Commons debate -- but he could run up against dangerous opposition from
his back benchers, fragmenting the new unity in the Tory Party.
His Ministers last night were looking for a compromise by which the
select committee uses the summer recess and the autumn overspill period
of Parliament to resolve the remaining issues in time to meet Nolan's
recommendation that new rules of conduct for MPs -- which they would be
obliged to sign -- will be in place for the start of the new session in
November.
The disagreement over consultancies is set to overshadow the
committee's agreement to a series of sweeping recommendations concerning
MPs behaviour.
Labour last night promised it would be mounting an intensive campaign
aimed at putting pressure on Tory MPs to back early implementation of
the changes in the Commons vote.
As well as the new code of conduct, the report also urges the
preparation of written guidance for MPs on the registration and
declaration of their interests as well as the code.
It said MPs should have to sign a form and return it to the Registrar
of Members' Interests confirming they had read the document.
The committee also agreed there was a need to clarify the law of
bribery as it relates to MPs.
The four Labour MPs on the committee, Shadow Leader of the House Ann
Taylor, Mr John Evans, Mr John Morris and Mr Stan Orme, issued a
statement welcoming the broad thrust of the report while warning that
they would continue to press on the issue of MPs consultancy work.
''A lot of work has been carried out in a very short time by the
committee but we are very disappointed by the attitude of the Tories and
Liberal Democrat on the committee over some of the matters involved,''
they said.
''Labour intends to raise these matters when the House debates the
issue. We are sure that members of the public will take careful note of
which way their MPs vote.
''Having forced the pace so far, Labour will continue to press the
Government to implement the Nolan recommendations within the timescale
laid down by Lord Nolan,'' the statement said.
Liberal Democrat member Mr Robert Maclennan (Caithness and Sutherland)
said: ''The rules requiring MPs to disclose outside income in detail
must be in place by November as Nolan recommended.
''Labour's proposals would have left too many loose ends and
uncertainties. They would also have allowed Tory members to claim, with
some justification, that the House of Commons was being bounced into an
imprecise and unworkable scheme which could be evaded.
''That would defeat the whole point of Nolan's recommendations.''
''The select committee on standards must now tackle the outstanding
questions before the end of this parliamentary session.''

EVERY Government's dream question time came true yesterday. The
Opposition asked no questions. Tory back benchers stood up and said at
length how wonderful the Government was and what a shower the Opposition
parties were, and Ministers then got up and agreed that the Opposition
was a shower and the Government was doing wonderfully well.
What had gone wrong with democracy? The Prime Minister had promoted Mr
William Hague, a Yorkshireman and Yorkshire MP, to be Secretary of State
for Wales, and the Welsh Labour, Nationalist, and Labour Democrat
parties had taken such umbrage that they mounted what Tories wittily
termed a ''boyocott'' of his first Welsh question time.
The Scottish Opposition might well have been forced to do the same, if
Mr Hague had been posted to the North instead of the West, but the
availability of Mr Michael Forsyth avoided that political gesture,
although doubtless they are thinking up other rude ones.
Such is the preponderance of the Opposition in the Principality as in
the Northern Kingdom -- 32 out of 38 seats -- that this withdrawal of
Labour gave Welsh questions a destitude look.
The Sketch has to report that splendid as HMG's performance west of
Offa's Dyke may be, the eloquence of Ministers and backbench feeds was
not quite up to filling the allotted 35 minutes, puff and hyperbolise
though they did.
All they could think of to say -- ''wonderful, shower, etc''-- had
been said, indeed several times, by 3.05pm and the House had to move on
early to the savage cut-and-thrust of questions to the Church
Commissioners, a quaint relic of the Establishment which lingers on for
five minutes a month.
It no longer features the kind of subjects that Pym, Hampden, and
Cromwell got worked up about.
However, Pym and Co. might have relished the clash of the scriptural
quotations as Labour MP Tony Banks lashed the Commissioners for
investing so heavily, and disastrously, in property with the clinching
quote about the camel who finds it easier to make it through the eye of
a needle than a rich man does getting into the Kingdom of Heaven.
But in the Second Church Commissioner, Mr Michael Alison, also MP for
Selby, he found an antagonist ready for him with the Scriptural
broadside of making unto ourselves friends of the Mammon of
unrighteousness and recalling the servant told off for not at least
investing his master's cash for an improved return.
Shadow Welsh Secretary Ron Davies denied that the boycott was
racialist. It was not because Mr Hague was an Englishman, but because he
knew nothing of Wales and had shown up to now no interest in Wales.
This reminded the Sketch of a journalist who, told to review a
600-page volume on Buddhism, protested that he knew nothing about the
religion. ''You will when you finish that,'' said his editor. Mr Hague
will soon be spouting Welsh facts in a Yorkshire accent and, being
perhaps more politically adroit than his predecessor, will probably
learn the words of ''Land of My Fathers'' in English if not in Welsh.
That Mr Hague is a politician of some class is proved by the fact that
he has managed to get into the Cabinet at 34, despite nationwide
publicity for a ''Boy Wonder'' speech to a Tory Party conference when 16
-- ''roll back the frontiers of the state', being described as
''possibly another young Pitt'' by Mrs Thatcher, and described by
another Tory MP as ''the next Prime Minister but 14''. To carry that
prophetical baggage while advancing to the position of ''next Prime
Minister but two or three'' shows the man is a star.
One was tempted to conclude that the boycott, like most such
demonstrations, had achieved absolutely nothing until a colleague
pointed out that we had been joined in the Press Gallery by 25 other
colleagues, an all-time record, we were pretty sure for Welsh Question
Time.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth faced challenges from his political
opponents yesterday to make good his promise to be Scotland's champion
in the Cabinet over future Scottish public spending levels and the
accountability of quangos.
Speaking in St Andrews, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson
challenged him to defend the Scottish Office budget for next year from
further cuts.
Local government leaders also called on him to act over his declared
wish to make quangos more accountable by giving elected councillors
control of the three new public water authorities.
Mr Robertson said the key question for Mr Forsyth would be whether he
could protect the Scottish Office budget for next year or whether he
would follow his idealogical roots by offering up cuts to the Treasury.
''It is absolutely crucial that the future Scottish Office budget does
not become the sacrificial lamb on the altar of Forsyth's
fundamentalism'' he said.
Addressing the fourth International Conference on Adult Education and
the Arts, Mr Robertson claimed that spending on housing, education,
roads and health had been badly hit and rolling cuts were set to take
their toll over the next two years.
The Scottish budget was one of the biggest in government and it would
become a key target in the autumn if the Chancellor was stil obssessed
with producing tax cuts for the next election.
''Scotland will be watching his every move,'' Mr Robertson said.
''Does the new right-wing standard bearer in the Cabinet still hold to
his public cash- cutting beliefs or will the Scottish interest triumph
over his old zealotry?''
Cosla's senior vice president Councillor Keith Geddes said it would be
an indication of the Secretary of State's good faith if he accepted the
position that at least a majority of the members of the new boards
should be councillors who were nominated by local authorities.
At his first news conference in Scotland last week, Mr Forsyth said he
was looking at the membership of the boards of the new authorities.
A Scottish Office announcement about who would serve on them has been
delayed.
The uncertainty remained yesterday as a spokesman said the Secretary
of State ''naturally wished to apprise himself of the background and the
current position before proceeding to an announcement.''

CONJURING MP Greville Janner surprised the Commons last night with a

Mr Janner (Leicester West), a member of the Magic Circle, produced a
small ball from behind his ear and with a puff made it disappear.
He is also chairman of the Employment Select Committee and was
illustrating a point about unemployment.
Attacking the ''disgraceful'' decision to scrap the Employment
Department, he said: ''We have an illusion.
''The illusion is that without a Department of Employment,

<TEXT>
ONE of the North of Scotland's most senior policemen yesterday
condemned Government plans to cut the number of Customs posts in
Scotland.
Deputy Chief Constable Findlay MacLennan, of Northern Constabulary,
warned that the move would be a serious blow in the battle to stop drug
smuggling.
His warning came in the wake of claims by Customs and Excise chiefs
that the planned cuts would not reduce the effectiveness of the
organisation.
Seven small Customs offices in Scotland are to close early next year,
with a further eight under threat.
In a public statement yesterday, Mr MacLennan said: ''Customs and
Excise officers have the primary responsibility for the prevention and
detection of the importation of drugs into the country.
''Any reduction in this level of protection is likely to adversely
affect their effectiveness.
''Those who are involved in the importation of illegal drugs will
probably identify and exploit any weakness caused by a reduction in
staffing levels.''
Customs and Excise spokesman, Mr Bill Forsyth, claimed in response
that the nature of the changes to the anti-smuggling organisation had
been misunderstood.
He said: ''There will be only a minimal reduction in numbers of
officers but there will be a key change in the way they are deployed.
''Instead of a thin blue line we will have targeted fast response
teams and an increased emphasis on intelligence.
''Instead of criticising this move, he should be welcoming it. We are
confident that it will lead to more large seizures of drugs.''
Mr Forsyth estimated that the cuts would involve a reduction of around
14% in the numbers of officers combatting drug smuggling.

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S police chiefs are pressing the Scottish Office for the
funds to build a computerised crime intelligence centre in Scotland
which would be linked directly to the National Criminal Intelligence
Service in London.
Senior officers believe the growing internationalism of crime makes
such a move necessary. However, to avoid suggestions that Scottish
forces were losing their independence to London, any such intelligence
headquarters would have a dual role. Part of it would be a regional
office of the NCIS and the remainder would house the Scottish Criminal
Intelligence Office, currently based in Glasgow.
Ideally, the Scottish forces would want such a centre built on a
green-field site outwith Glasgow and Edinburgh to avoid charges from
smaller forces that it would simply be an extension of either
Strathclyde Police or Lothian and Borders Police.
However, if that proved too expensive, other options such as housing
the unit within existing police premises would be explored.
At present, the National Criminal Intelligence Service in London has a
Scottish desk, with a staff of three, which deals with requests and
information from Scottish forces. That is now felt to be inadequate.
In the field of drug trafficking, for example, the bulk of drugs in
Scotland come via England and the Continent, which is why the services
of the NCIS are so important.
There are also indications that money forgers in Scotland are turning
to the Continent to pass off their fake notes.
Recently, two German thieves were convicted in their home country
after carrying out an armed robbery in Dundee.
Such cross-border activity means a greater reliance on pooled criminal
intelligence.
The new European policing agency Europol has made it clear that it
wants to deal with only one agency in each member state -- which in
Britain's case would be the NCIS, which adds to the necessity for the
Scottish forces to be more actively involved in it.
Such a centre would not be too labour intensive -- anything from two
to 17 staff, depending on which option the Scottish Office agreed on.
However, the sophistication of the electronics and the level of security
would mean it would still be an expensive business.
So far, there has been no indication from the Scottish Office what
option it would agree to fund but a sub-group of the Association of
Chief Police Officers Scotland is lobbying hard for an early decision.

SCOTTISH Industry Minister George Kynoch yesterday urged businesses
which believed their rates were unfairly high to appeal against their
assessment as quickly as possible.
The Federation of Small Businesses met the Minister to express its
concern that, despite Scottish Office attempts to introduce a Uniform
Business Rate, Scottish businesses were still being charged more than
English counterparts.
After the meeting in Glasgow, Mr Kynoch said: ''I would urge any
companies who feel they are getting an erroneous evaluation to appeal.
That's what it's there for.''
Mr Kynoch said he wanted further details of specific examples raised
by the federation and he would have them investigated.
Mr Kynoch and federation officials discussed a range of concerns,
including local government reform and the performance of the local
enterprise network.
The federation has been one of the few business organisations openly
critical of Government policies in the past but, afterwards, Mr Jim
Torrance of the FSB, said: ''This was a positive meeting and, from our
point of view, useful. We will now be having regular meetings with Mr
Kynoch.''
Mr Kynoch also looked forward to more meetings. ''The Government is as
keen as the federation to improve the fortunes of small businesses and
to lift any unnecessary burdens on them.''
Although no specific promises were made at the meeting, the Minister's
supportive remarks pleased officials of the federation: an indication
that members of the new Scottish Office team are keen to portray
themselves as listening Ministers to deflect criticism that the Tory
Government forces through unpopular policies in Scotland without taking
into account public opinion.

<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977453292</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Labour Party will launch a campaign today to protect public
libraries from being privatised.
Labour claims the Conservatives are willing to ''throw away a public
asset because they put ideology over common sense''.
As yet there has been no public announcement by the Government but
Labour claims there are sufficient indications that such a move is
planned.
It says a management consultants' report on libraries was changed on
the orders of the Government from its original conclusion that there was
''no case for compulsory contracting out'' to read that there was ''no
overwhelming case''.
In addition, recent Commons questions by Labour MPs failed to elicit a
guarantee that privatisation was not an option.
Labour believes the Government may insist that local authorities put
their library services up for compulsory competitive tendering. That
could lead to private companies winning contracts to supply libraries
with books and run them as well.
Labour argues that, to make a profit, such private companies would
inevitably cut staff, buy fewer books, close branches and reduce opening
hours.
Such a policy would not have an immediate impact in Scotland. Because
of local government reorganisation, there is a moratorium on compulsory
competitive tendering until the summer of 1997.

THE deaths yesterday of two men have led to safety campaigners
renewing their call to make the entire stretch of the A1 between
Edinburgh and Newcastle a dual carriageway.
The men died when their northbound Astra van crossed the single
carriageway near Cockburnspath and collided with an articulated lorry
heading south. They were later named as Mr Neil McAndrew, 26, of Bow
Street, Denbeith, Buckhaven, Fife and Mr Gordon Barclay, 29, of
Roseville School Wynd, East Wemyss, Fife.
The lorry driver, who was taken to hospital but was not thought to be
seriously injured, was named as Mr David Coull, 59, of Rigg Place,
Aberlady, East Lothian.
Non-dualled sections of the road in Scotland claimed 31 lives between
1990 and 1994. Campaigners have been battling to have the entire section
of the main east coast road south upgraded to dual carriageway.
Medic One, the flying squad of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, stood by as
firemen cut the dead and injured free.
The road south was closed for more than three hours after the crash at
7.15am, causing commuter chaos for workers on their way to nearby
Torness Power Station.
The families of the who died were last night too upset to speak but
neighbours said Mr McAndrew, a father of two, and Mr Barclay had been
with friends at weekend stock car meetings in Skegness.
Other members of the party had left earlier and Mr McAndrew and Mr
Barclay were returning home when the accident happened.
A forklift truck driver at the United Distillers blending and bottling
facility at Leven, Mr McAndrew was married to Jeanette, who is a team
trainer at the same plant.
His widow and their two children, eight year-old daughter Khrasa and
son Kendell, three, were being comforted by family and friends.
Mr Barclay, the son of Donald and Mollie Barclay, who also have a
married daughter, was single and worked in the family haulage business.
Mr George Wanless, chairman of East Lothian District Council, said the
accident illustrated the clear need for complete dualling of the
carriageway between Edinburgh and Newcastle.
He said firm plans were in place for the road to be dualled from
Edinburgh to Dunbar, but no timetable appeared to have yet been drawn up
for dualling south of Dunbar.
Mr Wanless said there were improvements planned to junctions along the
road, but added: ''The overall effect is of piecemeal improvements,
which if anything make the roads more dangerous rather than less
dangerous.
''This latest tragedy just emphasises once again the danger there is
on this road and the need for dualling all the way to Newcastle as soon
as possible.''
Mr John Home Robertson, Labour MP for East Lothian, who has led the
fight for the uprgrading of the whole route, said speed cameras had
helped cut the accident rate, but said this latest tragedy hammered home
the need for complete dualling.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: ''The A1 south of Dunbar
will be considered for dualling progressively as and when it is
appropriate within the Scottish trunk road programme, which is reviewed
regularly and looks at Scotland's major routes.''
Work is already under way on a #27.9m upgrading on the busiest section
of single carriageway between Gladsmuir and Haddington. The stretch
between Haddington and Dunbar is expected to be upgraded in 1997/98 at
an estimated cost of #30m.

A YOUNG Shetlander who died while shearing sheep was named last night
as Mr James Johnson, 24, a single man, of Newton, Skae, Lochend.
Police said Mr Johnson, an electrician, had been helping his family
shear sheep on their croft last Friday evening and had stayed on in an
outhouse to finish the work while his parents James and Shirley Johnson,
went back to the house.
When he did not return, his mother went to look for him and found him
lying dead at 2am on Saturday. He had apparently been electrocuted while
using an electric sheep clipper. It is understood that two sheep were
also killed.
Police said a post-mortem examination would be carried out and a
report sent to the procurator-fiscal at Lerwick. There were no
suspicious circumstances.

A MAN threatened to expose the cocaine habits of a well-known
international businessman unless he was paid #1m, the Old Bailey was
told yesterday.
Mr Linval Williams, the accused, is alleged to have repeatedly rang
the public and unlisted numbers of the multi-millionaire's West End
business trying to speak to him.
Mr Nicholas Coleman, prosecuting, said eventually that Mr Williams
told the millionaire's personal assistant that he knew a girl called
Veronika whom he claimed was willing to testify in court that Mr X took
cocaine.
Mr Coleman claimed that Mr Williams had said the information would get
the alleged victim into trouble as the Government wanted him out of the
country, and newspapers would be very interested in the drug-taking
story, claiming one newspaper had already offered him #500,000.
Mr X cannot be identified on the orders of the Recorder of London,
Judge Lawrence Verney, who also banned public identification of his
business.
In a series of calls last November on his mobile phone, it is alleged
that Williams made a series of demands which culminated in a final
figure of #1m made to Mr X's business head of security.
Mr Coleman told the jury that the Crown contended that the drug-taking
allegations against Mr X were untrue, but whether they were or not the
disclosure of them would be harmful to Mr X and his business.
Williams, 31, of no fixed address denies blackmail in November last
year.
The trial continues.

ARMED police arrested a 19-year-old man after a starting pistol was
fired as Prime Minister John Major arrived at his constituency home, it
was disclosed last night.
Police believe the starting pistol was fired two or three times in the
incident outside Mr Major's Huntingdon home in the early hours of June
18.
An armed officer from Cambridgeshire police detained the 19-year-old a
short distance from the scene within a minute.
The man was later charged with affray and given police bail until next
Monday.
Last night, a Cambridgeshire police spokesman said: ''There was no
evidence then or now to suggest any terrorist implications.''
A chauffeur-driven limousine carrying Mr Major had just pulled off the
main road and into the driveway of his home when a police officer on
duty at the gates heard what he thought might be a firearm being
discharged.
Cambridgeshire police said they put into effect ''a well-established
contingency plan'' and the 19-year-old was detained.
Mr Major was made aware of what had happened. A source described him
as having been ''quite unruffled''.
The starting pistol which was recovered was said to be incapable of
firing bullets.
The 19-year-old has not been named but comes from Huntingdon, where he
is expected to appear before magistrates on Monday.
The police spokesman said the force's security arrangements for the
Prime Minister had been examined in the light of the incident but added:
''We are satisfied that everything we could do was done.''

A BRITISH tennis coach who went on a drunken rampage through a team
hotel has reached an out-of-court settlement with the Lawn Tennis
Association after he was dismissed over his behaviour.
Mr Fraser Auld, who was in charge of a British youth team during an
international tournament in the Netherlands, sued the LTA for unfair
dismissal.
An earlier industrial tribunal hearing in Reading, Berkshire, was told
how Mr Auld, 31, set off a fire extinguisher, vomited in bed, and banged
on the door of the US team coach after a drinking binge on July 4 last
year.
Firefighters and police officers were called to the up-market hotel in
the Dutch town of Leuwarden after guests were awoken by banging and
screaming.
Mr Auld, of Berriedale Road, Barassie, Troon, was in charge of two
young women players who were due to meet up with a party of boys and
compete in an international tournament.
Mr Adrian Lynch, representing the Lawn Tennis Association, told the
hearing in March that Mr Auld spent the evening downing beers in the
hotel bar and then went to a room to continue drinking with Australian
coach David Drysdale and Swedish coach Helena Norrby.
Mr Lynch said Mr Auld set off a fire extinguisher, causing a Russian
coach in a nearby room to raise the alarm.
He added that Mr Auld then repeatedly banged on the door of US coach
Beverley Bowse, whom he had spoken to several times during the day.
The Netherlands Lawn Tennis Association had threatened to abandon the
whole Windmill Tournament following the alleged incident.
Mr Auld admitted drinking, setting off the fire extinguisher, and
making noise in the corridor but said he did not believe he had been
representing Britain at the time.
He said he was there purely as an escort.
The tribunal had been due to reconvene yesterday but the Lawn Tennis
Association released a statement saying the matter had been settled by
the two parties.
An LTA spokesman said: ''The parties resolved their dispute in
mutually acceptable terms and legal proceedings between them have
ceased.''
The spokesman refused to disclose the terms of the settlement.

A FAMILY from the North of England celebrated their #20.8m National
Lottery win by cracking open a bottle of champagne yesterday -- but
vowed: ''We won't let the win go to our heads''.
Mr Terry Benson and his family said they would change their lives as
little as possible and continue to be a close-knit family.
Their huge jackpot was the second biggest win on the lottery -- last
month, two double-glazing salesmen scooped #22m.
Terry, 61, came up with the winning line by noting down crate numbers
at the foundry where he works.
He and his wife Brenda, 56, will keep half the money and the rest will
be split between their four children.
The family were part of an occasional syndicate, paying #12 for
lottery tickets whenever they got together for family celebrations.
Mrs Benson said she believed that money could not buy happiness:
''I have been hard up and I was just as happy then as I am today. My
husband worked long and hard to make us manage. Sometimes he worked
seven days a week.''
The former factory worker said her children would not be affected by
the win, adding: ''They are level-headed and sensible.''
Mr Benson, a cricket fan who has worked as an electrician for 47
years, said he would now retire from his job with Starkeys Technicast in
Hull.
The couple have been happily married for 37 years and live in a
three-bedroomed terraced house which they bought from the local council.
Terry admitted that his win had not yet sunk in.
He said: ''On Friday night, I came home from work and in less than 24
hours we were millionaires.''
He plans to eventually buy a new house and may buy a racehorse with
one of his sons-in-law.
There are no plans for a car:''I have never owned one and don't want
to.''
He shares his good fortune with his daughters Tracy Foley, 30, Heather
Kemp, 36, and Nicola, 21, and his son Keith 34.
Nicola, who lives at the family home on the Boothferry Estate, Hull,
has just finished university and will do a post-graduate course at York
before becoming a teacher.
She has a steady boyfriend and said: ''I would like to go to Italy.''
Heather works for the Yorkshire Bank and has two daughters, Amy 13,
and Rebecca 12. Her husband John is a chemical engineer.
She said: ''The girls are animal mad and I would like to take them on
safari to Kenya.''
She and her brothers and sisters said they would definitely not be
transferring their children to public schools.
''They all go to superb schools where they are very happy and have
lots of friends,'' she added.
Her husband John, of Frodsham, near Chester, said the family had had a
meeting and had decided that the parents should get half the win because
of their hard work in bringing up the family.
Son Keith and his wife Sue live in Hessle, near Hull, and have a boy
aged 10 and a girl of 11.
Keith has been working as a butcher in an abattoir and says he now
hopes to follow his hobbies such as keeping dogs and racing pigeons.
Daughter Tracy and her engineer husband John, of Chester, have a girl
of three and a baby boy of four months.
The family were at a birthday party at an ex-servicemen's club when
Terry saw the winning numbers on a TV screen.
He said: ''I thought I had five but I could not remember my sixth
number.
''I didn't say anything until I got home at 11.15 and found the
ticket.''
He has been getting a bus to his #200-a-week job for 17 years, since
taking voluntary redundancy from his previous job.
Asked what he hoped would come of his win, he said: ''I have six
grandchildren and I am glad that they are going to be financially secure
for the rest of their lives.''
However, daughter Heather said she wanted things to go on as normal
for her children.
She said: ''I want to keep their feet on the ground. I do not want too
much to change.
''I want them to still have to work hard at school and to know that
not everything will be given to them on a plate.''
Heather and Tracey both live in Frodsham.
The family said they decided to go public because they thought it
would come out eventually and they did not want to lie to people they
knew.

<HEADLINE>Ford to invest #500m in new Jaguar</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977453299</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CAR giant Ford is set to announce it will build a new small Jaguar in
Britain in a #500m project that could create thousands of jobs.
The long-expected plan should be revealed later this week. The
Department of Trade and Industry is expected to provide #80m towards the
scheme.
The new car, codenamed X200, will probably be built at the company's
Castle Bromwich body plant in Birmingham, rather than at the Ford-owned
Jaguar's Coventry site.
The project could create 1000 jobs at Jaguar, and thousands more in
the motor industry. Production could start in 1998 with the car on sale
in 1999.
It is the Government's willingness to provide financial aid for the
project that is thought to have persuaded Ford to build the car in the
UK rather than at its plant in Wixom, Michigan.
The car is expected to have a distinctive Jaguar look, but could be
powered by a Ford engine and use the chassis of the latest Ford Scorpio.
The car will compete with the likes of the BMW 5-series, the Mercedes
C-class, and Toyota's small Lexus. Jaguar currently produces more than
40,000 cars a year but the new car will result in annual production
rising to about 150,000 cars a year by the turn of the century.
Many of the new cars will go to the USA, which accounts for nearly 50%
of Jaguar sales.
Bought by Ford in 1989, Jaguar was badly hit by the early 1990s
recession which seriously affected luxury car sales.
The company is now on the road to recovery, with sales this year,
boosted by the new XJ series, expected to be the highest since 1988.

IRMA Hadzimuratovic, the seven-year-old who became a symbol for the
plight of the victims in Bosnia, was ''an innocent victim of war'', a
coroner said yesterday.
She died after 12 operations, having never fully recovered from
injuries sustained in a mortar attack which killed her mother at their
Sarajevo home in July 1993.
Her doctor made a television plea to the world from her hospital
bedside and moved a nation.
Thousands rang the Foreign Offfice and Downing Street, and within
hours Mr Major cut though red tape to authorise a medical evacuation to
the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.
Critically ill from serious spinal and abdominal wounds, which led to
meningitis, Irma was airlifted from the war zone to the children's
hospital on August 9, 1993.
She died in her sleep on April 1 this year after contracting
septicaemia.
Her father Ramiz, 37, stayed in London with her sister Medina, four.
Mr Hadzimuratovic, who has been living in Camden, was at St Pancras
Coroners Court to hear Dr Stephen Chan's verdict.
The only witness to give evidence was consultant paediatrician Dr Quen
Mok, who said Irma was ''a very bright girl''.
He added: ''She picked up English and would communicate in English to
the nurses and in Bosnian to her father and sister.''
Although she was paralysed from the neck down, Irma went on shopping
trips and visited Covent Garden.
Dr Mok gave the cause of death as septicaemia due to multiple
intestinal adhesions, peritonitis from shrapnel injury and contributory
causes of quadraplegia and spinal cord injuries.
Giving his verdict, Dr Chan said: ''I would like to pay tribute to her
father for his courage and his dignity throughout, and also to the
medical and nursing personnel whose dedication was unfailing and
unquestionable.''

POLICE searching for a nature-loving teenager who vanished from his
home near Stirling on Friday now think he may have staged his
disappearance in a bid to join Greenpeace.
Steven Marcinkiewicz, 16, left a note saying he was going walking in
the Ochil Hills. Yesterday police said that they knew he had around #800
in cash when he left.
A search costing thousands of pounds and involving dog teams, mountain
rescue specialists and a helicopter was finally called off last night
after a Glasgow travel agent telephoned Alloa police station.
She said a youth resembling Steven had walked in on Friday and tried
to book a ticket to Peru. He walked out when he was told there were no
flights until Wednesday.
A former school friend said he had seen Steven twice in Glasgow on
Friday.
Inspector Jim Dow, of Central Scotland Police, said last night: ''He's
obviously staged his disappearance.
''We now know he's got his passport, clothing, camera, and a
considerable amount of money with him.
''We also know he's desperately concerned about the environment and
endangered species throughout the world.
''He is also very interested in the activities of Greenpeace.''
Mr Dow added that Steven had been ''enthralled'' by the case of
14-year-old Peter Kerry, who travelled to Malaysia on his father's
passport.
Unlike Peter, however, the tall Clackmannanshire youth could easily
pass for a student on vacation.
He is understood to have got ''a bit of a grilling'' when he tried to
buy his ticket to Peru in Thomas Cook, Gordon Street, Glasgow, and may
now try to leave Britain by ferry.
Mr Dow said: ''I also want to know where he's been staying. We want to
alert hostels, bed and breakfasts, and small hotels to the fact that he
is missing.''
Police put out a warning to all ports and airports after the travel
agent's report.
Mr Dow added: ''He could be going any place in the world.''
Mr Dow said: ''We want to here from anyone who's seen Steven or
travelled with him since Friday.''
He is described as 6ft 2ins, slim, with short dark hair, and may be
wearing black jeans, a New Zealand rugby top, and carrying a
multi-coloured haversack.
Last night at the family home in Menstrie Road, Tullibody, Steven's
mother, Janette, 46, said: ''I'm just overwhelmed by the thought that he
tried to get a ticket to Peru.
''It hasn't sunk in yet -- I can't really believe it. I just wish he'd
ring and tell us he's OK. If he's stuck we'll help him.''
She added: ''I'm relieved to know he's alive and well but I just dread
to think what his next move is going to be.''

A MAN who thinks Political Correctness is impolite was voted president
of the Law Society last night.
Rebel candidate Mr Martin Mears wants to shake up the ruling body for
63,900 solicitors in England and Wales with his no-nonsense approach.
He wants to do away with circulars reminding lawyers that they must be
careful not to offend women and ethnic minorities.
He said last night: ''We know a number of solicitors who receive these
things and are annoyed. The great majority of our profession are not
prejudiced and do not want to practise discrimination. The vast majority
are decent people and do not need to be reminded to be polite.''
Mr Mears swept into power after challenging the society's
establishment. Previously, the existing vice-president automatically
took the top job.
However, Mr Mears forced an election for the first time in 40 years
and beat the Law Society council's preferred candidate, Mr Henry Hodge,
by more than 3000 votes.
After the challenge was launched, the then candidate for president, Mr
John Young, stood down after it emerged that sexual harassment
allegations had been made against him.
Mr Mears, 55, a partner in the Norwich law firm of Mears Hobbs and
Durrant, has been a member of the council for one year -- seven years
less than it would normally take someone to reach the presidency.
He was instrumental in recently getting members to reduce the
president's annual salary from a proposed #90,000 to #45,000.
He wants to improve the society's ''catastrophic'' record in
negotiating Legal Aid rates -- he thinks lawyers should be paid more --
and accuses the society of ''arrogance'' and treating the profession
''with contempt''.
Now he promises to watch the finances and will go on trips abroad only
if they truly benefit the society.
Mr Mears received 11,550 votes after 23,593 solicitors voted.
The outgoing Law Society president, Mr Charles Elly, said: ''I
congratulate Martin Mears and Robert Sayer on their success in these
elections and I wish them well during their terms of office.
''Although any contested election will always be difficult for all
concerned, I am sure that the vigorous debate which the election has
provoked will be good for the profession.''
Mr Mears and Mr Sayer -- both newly-elected council members --
launched the attack on the establishment together.
Mr Sayer is a partner in the small general London practice of Sayer
Moore and Co.

THE bombshell for the workforce came only days after each member of
staff received a ''company report'' with a message from Mr Warwick
Brindle, managing director of Scotsman Publications, about plans for
1995 which were ''bold and adventurous''. The document indicated that
1994 had been a good year for the company, with TSPL producing a net
profit of #9m which ''exceeded plan'' by nearly 6%.
That performance, the 850 staff at North Bridge were told, had been
achieved with the help of effective controls over costs. These had risen
only 3% despite a 4% rise in newsprint and a 3.5% increase in staff
costs. Newspaper sales had shown a marginal decline caused largely by
the cover price wars.
In his report, Mr Brindle said 1995 would be a very demanding year.

STAFF at Scotsman Publications headquarters at North Bridge,
Edinburgh, sought solace in the bars around their offices, reeling from
the news that they were on the market.
Plenty were talking but no-one was prepared to be named. The main fear
was over long-term uncertainty, if a buyer is not found quickly.
Many said the announcement that the publications were up for sale had
taken them completely by surprise. ''We had no idea this was about to
happen. The staff are stunned. We just don't know what is going to
happen,'' said one.
He claimed morale on all three newspapers at North Bridge had been at
a low ebb for some time.
''None of the newspapers has the same editor as it did a year ago.
Many award-winning staff have left, with no other jobs apparently in the
offing. There is no stability.
''They issued a report to staff last week, which showed Scotsman
Publications made a #9m profit last year, but it showed circulation was
down on both the Evening News and the Scotsman.
''Staff feel distanced from the real bosses. Thomson Regional
Newspapers is really run from Toronto.''
A second insider claimed the move had come as no great shock.
''I suppose it has just been a matter of time since the death of Roy
Thomson, because his son has never held the papers dear to his heart in
the same way as his father.''
A third member of staff said while there was concern, there was also
hope.
''While people are worried about things like pension funds, there is
also the hope that we can only go up.''
Others believe the Scottish arm of TRN has always been on the market.
''At the end of the day, it's no surprise. TRN has always made it
clear they were open to offers for their newspapers.''
Staff at Aberdeen Journals were also taken aback by the announcement.
''No-one really knows what is happening. We don't know any more than
the people outside,'' said one.
No member of senior management at Aberdeen Journals was available for
comment. Mr Alan Scott, the managing director, returned from holiday
yesterday and was involved immediately in a series of meetings.

ITV yesterday launched an estimated #200m blockbuster bid to win
viewers back from the BBC this autumn.
Executives were coy about how much they had spent on heading off the
competition after advertisers complained about the cost of air time, but
the implication was plain.
ITV chief Mr Marcus Plantin said: ''This schedule is designed to give
the BBC a good run for its money. For a public service broadcasting
corporation they are behaving in a very commercial way.''
He said ITV had set up a contingency fund to back big budget shows to
strengthen the onslaught against the BBC.
Mr Plantin was critical of the aggressive way the BBC has been
operating under its director-general, Mr John Birt. ''The only way to
have a winner is to have a range of programmes that the people like,''
he said.
He added that ITV would be striving to win back Saturday night viewers
lost to the BBC with the Lottery coverage.
A definitive documentary on The Beatles tells all in their own words,
with exclusive archive footage. ITV will also premiere for British
television audiences two new Beatles songs when they are released later
this year.
The enigmatic Inspector Morse returns for a new feature-length story,
The Way Through The Woods, after viewers clamoured for more.
Britain's answer to Top Gun, Strike Force, will bring dramatic
airborne action set on an RAF fighter squadron base in a one-off which
could become a series.
Coronation Street celebrates its 35th anniversary and there will be a
special week of The Bill, while Denis Norden marks ITV's 40th
anniversary with 40 Years Of ITV Laughter, in a trio of celebratory
shows.
Returning favourites include Cracker for a final series; Soldier,
Soldier; Taggart; Medics; Class Act; London's Burning; and Heartbeat.
Heartbeat star Nick Berry also stars in a 90-minute pilot drama,
Paparazzo -- which might become a series -- about an unscrupulous
photographer who never fails to get his picture of celebrities, whether
they want it or not.
Four Weddings and a Funeral star John Hannah plays a forensic
pathologist working in the sinister underbelly of London's East End in
McCallum, and, to herald the Wednesday night football season, there is a
new comedy drama from the producers of An Evening With Gary Lineker,
called The Perfect Match.
Saturday nights will feature top box office movies plus shows such as
Jonathan Ross's light-hearted investigation into the man behind the myth
of Agent 007, In Search of Bond, and new game show, Raise The Roof, with
a #100,000 house as top prize.

THE embattled tour operator Sunset Holidays, the company responsible
for 207 holidaymakers who were stranded in Glasgow over the weekend,
yesterday ordered a ''full internal investigation'' into operations amid
criticism from the trade association, Abta.
It will examine claims that it failed to provide adequate information
or company representatives to deal with the passengers who departed at
noon yesterday, 34 hours after their original Oasis A310 Airbus had to
return to Glasgow Airport.
Passengers signed a petition, refusing to travel on the aircraft, when
it had to jettison fuel and return to the airport after a suspected
engine fire.
The holidaymakers waited overnight in three hotels near the airport,
while Sunset found an alternative aircraft -- a Swedish Air Ops Tristar
-- to take them to Las Palmas, in Gran Canaria.
Twenty-four of the tourists, most of whom had booked one-week
holidays, subsequently cancelled. Yesterday, Sunset said they would be
refunded by insurers and promised compensation for those who travelled.
Some passengers claim they were denied clear information about
rescheduling for at least 24 hours afterwards and that, when they
arrived at Glasgow Airport yesterday morning, there were no Sunset
representatives there to deal with their queries.
One passenger, Mr Brian Caulfield, 27, of Balloch, said: ''It was a
farce from start to finish. First the plane was late taking off, then
the engine went on fire, and we were given no information or help. We
didn't have a clue what was going to happen when we were waiting for
news in the hotel.''
Mrs Iris Turnbull, 30, of Aberdeen, said: ''We were told when we had
landed that we would be given half-hour updates of what was happening.
But after we had been taken to a nearby hotel, it took hours before
anybody got in touch to say what was going on.''
Yesterday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the Bolton-based operators
could not confirm whether a representative had been present at the
airport yesterday morning.
She added: ''We will be holding a full internal investigation
involving our own staff in Glasgow, the aircraft company, and the
handling agent, Servisair.''
She said Sunset employed only one agency representative at the
terminal, Scotland's busiest international airport, who had dealt with
12 other flights at the weekend.
Earlier, Mr Phillip Pattison, Sunset's chief executive, issued an
official apology to its customers for the ''distress'' caused and said
the company had done ''everything possible'' to speed up their
departure.
He said that safety had been the company's foremost concern, adding:
''Due to this being the high season and at aweekend, when all aircraft
are highly utilised, no substitute aircraft was immediately available.''
The Oasis A310 is the same type of aircraft as a Romanian Airbus which
crashed in March after suffering technical problems, killing all 60
passengers on board.
The trade association Abta, which represents 7000 UK travel agents and
600 tour operators including Sunset, said the company had done ''very
well'' in arranging an alternative aircraft within 36 hours and praised
it for offering hotel accommodation and meals for passengers.
However, Abta said it was ''surprised'' at the lack of information
provided by the operator. A spokesman added: ''If an operator is aware
people have been stranded or delayed, then it would seem only sensible
to provide someone to tell them why. With most holidaymakers,
information is half the battle -- if they know why there is a delay,
then things aren't so bad.''
However, Sunset was backed by Servisair, whose staff liaised at
Glasgow Airport on behalf of Oasis. Spokesman Mr Tony Brunskill said:
''These situations are never particularly easy, as you often can't give
out definitive statements due to all the imponderables as to how and
when repairs can be carried out.
''We hope the passengers will enjoy their holiday in the sun and at
the end of it see everything possible was done.''

As the Orange riots flare, John Cooney poses the question troubling
Dublin.
THE Irish Government watched helplessly at the ugly upsurge of
sectarian violence in County Armagh last night.
Senior Ministers privately expressed their fears that the Orange
Order's showdown with the Royal Ulster Constabulary could provoke the
IRA into an immediate resumption of its traditional role as the supreme
defender of the besieged Roman Catholic minority community in Ulster.
Last night Mr Bertie Ahern, the leader of Fianna Fail the main
republican party in the south, expressed his concern that the show of
Orange force could reinforce the determination of the IRA to refuse to
hand over its weapons and explosives, as demanded by the British
Government as the price of its participation in political talks.
Mr Ahern was worried that the latest clashes between the Orange Order
and the RUC could so exacerbate tensions that the British and Irish
Governments could be neutralised in their diplomatic search for a
compromise on the vexed issue of the release of paramilitary prisoners.
The official line in Dublin last night was that it had no comment on
the incidents. ''These are an operational matter for the RUC to deal
with,'' a spokesman for Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said.
Irish Government officials continued to insist there was no risk to
the IRA ceasefire.
Earlier yesterday, Irish officials had held to the line that there was
no substance in weekend newspaper reports that the IRA leadership has
ordered its commanders to be on a war footing.
Late last night, however, the escalation of the situation in County
Armagh dampened this optimistic reaction.
A shadow has also been cast over earlier hopes in Dublin that British
and Irish officials will bring forward a package deal in the next few
days to resolve the linked issues of the release of paramilitary
prisoners and a schedule for the handing over of arms and explosives.
It had been envisaged that such a package would dramatically help to
reduce Orange and Green tensions in the wake of the release from prison
last week of Private Lee Clegg.
As well as devising a formula on the decommissioning of arms, Dublin
has intensified its pressure on Britain to announce prison reforms, such
as the transfer of republican prisoners back to prisons in Ireland.
Irish officials have also demanded that Britain address the frustrations
felt by nine prisoners -- both loyalist and republican -- who had been
due for release ahead of Private Clegg.
Last night an Irish Government official indicated that it may be
towards the end of the month before proposals emerge from a joint
committee set up by Prime Ministers John Major and John Bruton.
But with events now being forced at a pace determined by the Orange
Order, the Irish Government is falling back on a damage limitation
strategy.
Today Irish officials based at a special office in Belfast will send
their highly confidential assessment to the Dublin Cabinet of the extent
of the damage inflicted on the peace process.
The situation will be assessed by the Irish Government at its weekly
Cabinet meeting tomorrow.
A Government official said last night that there were no plans for any
emergency summit between Mr Major and Mr Bruton before their respective
summer holidays.
However, a meeting scheduled for the end of the month between Sir
Patrick Mayhew, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and the Irish
Foreign Minister Mr Spring, will now assume greater political importance
in the light of the deteriorating situation thoughout Ulster.
Yesterday's incidents were an echo of ten years ago in Portadown when
lines of police and armoured vehicles -- with soldiers of the Queen's
Own Highlanders in reserve -- barred the Orangemen's path through an
area known as ''the tunnel'', for 150 years the route of the July march.
Several police were hurt as they were bombarded with stones and
bottles. Orangemen in their bowler hats and ceremonial orange sashes hit
out at riot shields with their umbrellas.
The Rev Ian Paisley was there, as he was there yesterday.

A GROUP of Scottish Tory businessmen is set to bid to take over the
Scotsman newspaper.
The Herald can reveal a consortium led by lawyer Professor Ross Harper
is preparing a multi-million pound offer for the daily and four other
papers in Scotland currently owned by Canadian-based Thomson Regional
Newspapers.
The Scotsman's stablemates Scotland On Sunday and the Evening News in
Edinburgh, and the Press and Journal and Evening Express in Aberdeen are
on the target list. The five newspapers employ more than 1500.
Two weekly free newspapers, both titled The Herald and Post, which
circulate in Edinburgh and Aberdeen are also affected.
Professor Harper, former president of the Scottish Conservative and
Unionist Association, confirmed last night he had put a team together to
make a bid.
He said: ''We are interested in all the Scottish titles up for sale. I
will be writing to Thomson Regional Newspapers to register our interest.
''My personal view is that I would hope that Scottish newspapers could
be owned in Scotland by Scots.
''The problem with any bid for the titles will be over the price.
Newspaper owners have a habit of thinking that their product is worth
more than it is.''
Scottish Conservative Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst said he hoped
that whoever took over the paper would ''institute an editorial policy
which is less unsympathetic to the Government''.
Political parties last night criticised the move. Labour's Brian
Wilson described it as ''a crude attempt to acquire a political
mouthpiece in Scotland''.
Former Scotsman editor Mr Magnus Linklater said that any attempt ''to
buy this newspaper or any national newspaper for purely political ends
is going to be fatal for the newspaper's interests''.
The Herald believes TRN expects Aberdeen Journals to go on the market
for around #112m and the Scotsman for #120m.
Professor Harper refused to be drawn on where the money for the bid
would come from or give the names of the other people in the consortium.
However, The Herald understands those likely to be approached include
Mr Bill Hughes, chairman and chief executive of Grampian Holdings; Lord
Macfarlane, chairman of the Clansman Group and United Distillers; and
merchant banker Angus Grossart.
Others who have previously shown an interest in Scottish media
ownership include Mr Iain Sproat, now Minister of State at National
Heritage, and former editor of the Sunday Times, Mr Andrew Neil.
Meanwhile, an un-named source telephoned the Scotsman yesterday
morning offering all the cash for a management buy-out. It is not known
how serious management is taking the offer or from whom it came.
Among the other groups likely to be interested in the papers are
Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail; United News,
publisher of the Yorkshire Post; Pearson, which publishes the Financial
Times; the Scottish-based Johnston group; and magazine giants EMAP.
A spokesman for Caledonian Publishing Ltd, publishers of The Herald
and Evening Times, said: ''We have noted the statement made by the
Thomson Corporation with regard to their Scottish newspapers. This is a
development we are watching closely but at present we are reserving our
position.''
American-based director of TRN, Mr Mark Knight said it would take a
''very strong bid'' to prise away its Scottish titles. Mr Knight said
the company considered them first-class newspapers and the staff had
nothing to fear from the fact it would be listening to bids. ''If no
suitable offers are received they will be retained and developed
aggressively as part of our ongoing newspaper publishing interests,''
said Mr Knight.
However, staff at the Scotsman were last night shocked and angry at
the company's decision to try to end its so-called ''sentimental''
association with the paper, the first one owned by Lord Thomson of
Fleet.
They thought they had survived TRN sell-off plans announced by the
parent company over the weekend when all the English, Welsh, and
Northern Irish papers were sold to Chester-based Trinity International
Holdings in a #328m deal.
The Scottish newspapers were not included in the sale. However, 24
hours later it was announced TRN would be listening to offers for these
titles.
The Scotsman staff were officially told it was for sale by editor Jim
Seaton who read a short statement to them at 3.15pm. He then took
questions from staff on the future of the titles.
One senior Edinburgh staff source said: ''We just can't believe this.
One day we are told the company has a sentimental attraction to the
Scottish titles the next they are trying to sell us off.
''We're taking their assurance that they will develop the titles if no
buyer is found with a pinch of salt. Their sentimentality seems to have
been taken over by hard-headed business thinking. It's clear they want
to get rid of us, so long as it's to the highest bidder.''
Tory chairman Sir Michael Hirst said: ''I am not privy to the thinking
within TRN about the future of the Scottish titles. I am not aware of
any group of Tories who have acquisition plans but if there is to be any
change of ownership I hope that the new owners would institute an
editorial policy which is less unsympathetic to the Government and more
in tune with the exciting things that are happening in Scotland today.''
Concern was last night expressed over the future of the newspapers and
guarantees sought for the workers employed at both print centres.
The Scottish National Party leader, Mr Alex Salmond, said he would be
writing to TRN for assurances over staff levels and over the future
independence of the titles.
When asked about the possibility of a Tory buy-out of the Scotsman and
the other titles, Mr Salmond claimed it had been clear for some time the
Tories were trying to gain a foothold in the Scottish press.
Mr Salmond added: ''It is clear that a few years ago the Tories tried
to gain influence in The Herald and such a similar move involving the
Scotsman would be deeply regretted.
''It would be foolish to run a propaganda sheet for the Tory Party and
it would go down the plug-hole as fast as Tory fortunes in Scotland.''
Mr Wilson was dismissive over the Tory businessmen's plans to buy the
papers.
He said: ''I am certain that a crude attempt to acquire a political
mouthpiece in Scotland would backfire on them.
''Someone would have to buy the Scottish Daily Tory and I suspect that
their market would be quite small.''
The president of the Liberal Democrats, Mr Robert Maclennan, expressed
concern over the future of all the newspaper titles.
Mr Maclennan, who is also the party's media spokesman, said: ''It is
important that the diversity and quality of Scotland's newspapers is
maintained and the ownership is not concentrated in the hands of the few
for the sake of the entire Scottish newspaper industry as well as TRN's
workforce in Scotland.''
Mr Angus Grossart, managing director of Edinburgh-based merchant
bankers Noble Grossart said he was watching developments with interest.
Mr Grossart, a key adviser to leading Scottish corporates and a
leading player in the financial community, said: ''Everyone is
interested in the newspaper sector and people will be looking at things
with considerable interest.
''I cannot comment on specifics but I will be watching the situation
with interest.''
Mr Seaton was unavailable for comment last night.

POLICE opened fire with plastic bullets when they were attacked by
Orange protesters in Portadown last night in the worst loyalist violence
in years.
Some police officers were injured when stones, bottles and sticks were
hurled into their ranks. There was no immediate sign of any injury among
the crowd.
The plastic bullets drove the crowd away from police lines deeper into
fields.
The trouble broke out at the blockade the RUC had established on
Sunday to prevent the Orange march parading into the nationalist
Garvaghy Road area moments after the Rev Ian Paisley had made a fiery
speech.
The leader of the Democratic Unionist Party was cheered when he said:
''There can be no turning back on this issue . . . we will die if
necessary rather than surrender.''
The crowds chanted and shouted abuse at the RUC. Then the clashes
started.
An ITN camera crew which tried to get into the field to film the rally
at close quarters was attacked and chased off.
Mr Paisley, who also told the crowd that they had gathered to
establish the right of the Protestant people to march, and the local
Ulster Unionist Party MP David Trimble, at one point broke through
police lines, accompanied by a handful of Orangemen.
They were halted after about 100 yards.
As the night progressed a large section of the crowd tried to outflank
police lines by running across open fields to get nearer the Garvaghy
Road.
Police again opened fire with plastic bullets, stones were hurled at
them and pitched battles broke out.
Police commanders constantly had to move their men to combat the
crowds.
An Army helicoptor hovered above filming proceedings.
A spokesman for the RUC in Belfast said: ''A number of police officers
have been injured.
''Stones and bottles have been thrown by protesters and a number of
baton rounds (plastic bullets) have been fired by police.''
He could give no information about numbers of arrests or protesters
injured, or whether any police were seriously hurt.
After cross-country running battles, police finally held the breakaway
element of the crowd on the edge of the Roman Catholic Ballyoran Park
housing estate, just a couple of hundred yards from the Garvaghy Road.
Some of the crowd, driven back by police, set fire to a hedge in the
middle of the field.
About 200 people gathered within the estate, but were kept well away
from the loyalists.
Mr Jeffery Donaldson, assistant grand master of the Orange Order in
Ireland, said the whole Order stood behind those in Portadown. It was,
he said, ''a stand for freedom''. He added: ''We demand the right to
process the Queen's highway free from republican interference.''
The ranks of Orangemen in Northern Ireland are set to swell today with
the influx of members of the Order from Scotland. While some have
already arrived, hundreds more are expected to travel today for the
traditional July 12 march through Belfast tomorrow
They could have a travel problem caused by their own supporters. The
Antrim ferry port of Larne was virtually under siege last night with
lorries blocking the main road and crowds blocking others.
Local Ulster Unionist Party MP Roy Beggs said he had been informed by
the protesters around Larne that their blockade would remain until the
Portadown issue was resolved.
In Belfast police reported crowds gathered in various loyalist areas
and roads briefly blocked.
Earlier, Mr Paisley told the rally of several thousand that they had
gathered to establish the rights of the Protestant people to walk down
the Garvaghy Road.
''It is a very serious issue because it lies at the very heart and
foundation of our heritage, at the foundation of the future of our
family and this Province that we love,'' he said.
''There can be no turning back on this issue . . . we will die if
necessary rather than surrender.
''If we don't win this battle, all is lost. It is a matter of life or
death, it is a matter of Ulster or Irish Republic, it is a matter of
freedom or slavery.''
He condemned Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew for
''washing his hands of this matter''.
He added: ''He can wash his hands of the Protestants of Portadown but
he shook hands with Gerry Adams.''
Mr Paisley later held talks with the RUC at the blockade. He said
after his discussions with police chiefs that he believed an agreement
to resolve the Portadown situation was near.
He said: ''I think we are close to an agreement which will involve no
loss of face on either side and no surrender on the part of the Orange
Order.''
Soon afterwards, an Orange Order official told the crowd that the
local Orange Order members would be able to parade down the Garvaghy
Road. He said that after talks with the police, it was agreed those
stopped from marching could complete their route but the thousands
gathered to support them had to disperse.
There was no confirmation from the RUC.
Mr Paisley said: ''I think we have succeeded in calming the people,
succeeded in getting order out of disorder and I believe we are making
progress.''
He expressed his ''disappointment'' at those who had taken the law
into their own hands and attacked the police. It was a result of a build
up in Protestant tensions over the past three years to a point which
they had to vent their anger. They had had enough, he said.

THE Government's plans for an early privatisation of ScotRail appear
to have been derailed by the increasing political furore over the Fort
William sleeper service.
Industry insiders say proposals to invite tenders for ScotRail in
September have now been abandoned. It is claimed the operating company
has been relegated to the ''too difficult'' category in the meantime by
the Passenger Rail Franchising director.
Tender invitations will probably be postponed for at least two months,
throwing into doubt the chances of selling the operating company by the
Government's April deadline.
ScotRail was a member of the original ''fast track'' group of eight
train operating companies to be sold off by April 1, 1996. Any delay in
getting in bids could jeopardise the whole timetable.
The rail operating company has had a turbulent year, making it less
attractive to buyers. On top of legal challenges over plans to axe the
sleeper service, ScotRail has had to contend with claimed cash problems
and a dispute with Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive.
A spokeswoman for ScotRail admitted yesterday that problems had
affected preparation for franchising. She insisted, however, that
ScotRail would still be in the first tranche of companies to be
privatised next April and said it was only ''conjecture'' that ScotRail
would have been open to tenders in September.
Mr Henry McLeish, Labour transport spokesman, said the problems with
the ScotRail tendering timetable had opened the door for the whole
process to be abandoned.
A spokesman for the Passenger Rail Franchise director appeared to
indicate that ScotRail would not make September's tender invitations. He
said they would take place for ScotRail ''in due course''.
Meanwhile, attempts to head off a series of one-day strikes by train
drivers, due to begin this Friday, will resume today.
