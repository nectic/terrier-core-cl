THE fuel of business growth is money and like other fuels it comes in
different forms. At different stages of your company's growth, different
forms of funding will be most appropriate. Our money map points out some
of those types of funding. It is not definitive -- you should always
take professional advice -- and the stages of company growth can overlap
or differ between companies. Like the road we have depicted, business
development seldom moves in a straight line. It will, however, show you
that there are more ways to fund your company than you probably first
thought.
Overdraft
THIS is perhaps the most popular method of borrowing, usually based on
your company's cash flow projections. It can fluctuate within an agreed
limit, and should you require to extend that limit this can usually be
arranged locally. This type of borrowing is repayable on demand, and is
agreed over a specific period.
Term Loan
TERM loans are available for specific asset purchases. Repayment terms
are usually built around the anticipated useful lifetime of the asset. A
number of repayment options are available, including fluctuating or
fixed-rate loans, or ''bullet'' repayments from the proceeds of a
pension or insurance policy where interest only is paid on the loan.
Commercial Mortgage
A variation of the term loan, this is a flexible arrangement to be
used when purchasing or expanding commercial property for business use.
It is available for up to 25 years and can be used to fund up to 70% of
the purchase of the property or its valuation, whichever is the lower.
This is also available from Bank of Scotland with a Low Start repayment
plan, when a lower interest rate applies for the first two years.
Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme
RUN in conjunction with the Department of Trade and Industry, this is
available where traditional bank borrowing is not possible: for example,
because of a lack of security. The borrower must have contributed all
available assets and the bank must be satisfied that the venture is
viable. Borrowing can be between #5000 and #250,000. The DTI guarantees
70% of the loan, for which the borrower pays a small premium, and
repayment is over a seven-year period.
Small Business Loan Scheme
This scheme is run through Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish
Clearing Banks and is primarily for business development. It is
available to manufacturing and business services firms based in Scotland
with less than 250 employees. Interest rates for the beginning of the
loan are capped, and unlike the Loan Guarantee Scheme, funds can be used
partially to re-finance existing borrowing. Repayment is over a maximum
of seven years.
Central and Local Government Grants
THE range and variation in grants from area to area means you will
have to check with your local offices, but grants are available towards
the purchase of premises and equipment, towards employing people who
have been unemployed for certain periods and towards training.
Specialised Investors
BODIES such as British Coal Enterprise and British Steel (Industry)
were set up to help regenerate areas affected by the run down of those
industries. They provide funding in the form of loans and venture
capital (see later). Scottish Enterprise also has its own venture
capital arm, Scottish Development Finance. Often their role is crucial
in providing the first piece of a financial package which attracts in
other backers.
Factoring and Invoice Discounting
FACTORS assume responsibility for the sales ledger and debt
collection. As soon as an invoice is sent to them, the factors will
provide up to three-quarters of its value, with the rest payable when
the invoice is settled in full. This means your business receives cash
which could otherwise be tied up in invoices for months.
Hire Purchase
COMMERCIAL hire purchase works in a similar way to personal hire
purchase: the company receives ownership once the final payment is made.
In the meantime, though, the asset is treated as being owned by the
hirer, and the interest on the hire charge is seen as an allowable
business expense by the taxman.
Leasing
Leasing removes the need for initial funding to purchase new assets.
The business negotiates with the asset supplier, but the leasing company
purchases the asset and leases it to the business. Terms of the lease
will determine whether the asset is regarded for tax and accounting
purposes as belonging to the business or to the leasing company.
European Funding
THE European Coal and Steel Community Loans Scheme provides loans to
companies hard hit by the demise of these industries. The idea is to
encourage investment and job creation in those areas worst affected: in
Scotland the scheme is confined to Strathclyde, Fife and Lothian. For
businesses with fewer than 500 employees, loans may be available from
the European Investment Bank. Both types of loan can subsidise interest
payments, subject to the number of jobs created by them.
Innovation Grants
BRITISH and European grants for innovation are channelled through the
DTI and Scottish Office Industry Department. Some, such as SMART (Small
firms Merit Award for Research and Technology) are competitive and have
an annual closing date. Others have detailed criteria, such as the
Regional Enterprise Grant for Innovation which is for ''most''
activities but excludes man-made fibres and yarns and includes fisheries
and ''certain'' agricultural products.
Business Angels
THE LINC network, details of which are available from Scottish
Enterprise, helps to put young, growing companies in touch with
individuals with funds to invest. They are usually successful business
people in their own right and can provide advice as well as funds.
Venture Capital
VENTURE capitalists, who usually manage funds on behalf of investors,
look for early-stage companies to invest in. The greater risk is offset
by the fact that success will bring a greater return and the level of
funding needed in the early stages is usually lower. In return the
venture capitalist will want to own a substantial proportion of the
company. He will usually want to sell this stake on in the medium-term,
say five to 10 years.
Alternative Investment Market
LAUNCHED only on June 19 this year, the AIM is a second tier to the
London Stock Exchange with lower costs for entry and less strict rules
about the proportion of shares that have to be owned by outsiders.
Scottish-based lawyers Neil Clerk are offering a complete package for
firms joining AIM at around #50,000. Its greatest importance will be in
allowing other investors, such as angels and venture capitalists, a way
to recoup their investment -- and so might make them keener to invest in
your company in the first place.

THE notion that polluters of the countryside should pay for their
mistakes is one that is rapidly becoming established in the fiscal
system. While there is general approval, there are specific areas of
concern for both farmers and landowners, according to both the NFU and
the Scottish Landowners' Federation.
The Environment Bill currently going through its committee stages in
the House of Lords will set up Scottish Environmental Protection Agency
(SEPA) with a wide range of powers including control over land and field
drainage.
However, it is the proposed Landfill Tax which is of most immediate
concern. The intention to introduce this tax was indicated in the Budget
last November but it is only now after the publication of a consultation
paper that the full implications for farmers are coming to light.
Basically the Government is seeking to impose a tax of 30% on the
value of waste tipped at designated sites. In theory this may be sound
but according to the NFU's legal expert Ian Melrose the consequences for
farmers could be serious.
Speaking yesterday, Mr Melrose said: ''I think it will lead to an
increase in fly-tipping in certain areas of Scotland because some people
will just not be willing to pay extra charges to cover the tax.
''Fly-tipping is bad enough in some parts of West and Central Scotland
and this tax, unless it is properly thought out, could lead to all sorts
of difficulties with highly-unsuitable waste being dumped anywhere.''
This could put the onus on innocent farmers to clean up since the
Environment Bill states in Clause 54 that where contaminated land
requires attention then the person ''who caused or knowingly permitted
the particular substance to be on the land will be responsible''.
However, if that offending person cannot be found then the liability
passes to the owners or the occupier of the land.
Both the NFU and the SLF have made submissions to the Customs and
Excise with the SLF concluding their case by saying: ''Our primary
concern is that the imposition of such a tax will be bad for the
environment. The costs of remedying illegal tipping are extremely high
for the volume of waste involved. The SLF is therefore opposed to the
proposed introduction of a Landfill Tax.''

LEE KONITZ first played in Glasgow in the late autumn of 1958. He was
a member of an all-star package that also featured Zoot Simms, J J
Johnson, Kai Winding, Phineas Newborn, Oscar Pettiford and Kenny Clarke.
I remember going to St Andrew's Halls that night. I remember fish and
chips afterwards at the Berkeley restaurant. I remember absolutely
nothing in between -- not one note of what must have been some
remarkable music remains in the memory banks. My only excuse, if I need
one at this late date, is that I was 13. Ten years before, Konitz, then
aged 20, was a member of the Claude Thornhill band. Leaving late in
1948, the alto saxophonist's burgeoning reputation as a player of some
significance was further enhanced by his involvement with a nine-piece
Miles Davis group. Only a handful of recordings and a couple of gigs
between 1948 and 1950, yet the unit made an impact that reverberates to
this day. In the summer of 1952 Konitz was to be found in Stan Kenton's
reed section. He remained so for just over a year. That experience over,
Konitz was not to be a sideman again. From then until now he has been
master of his own musical destiny.
In 1957, Konitz signed with Norman Granz's Verve Label and the
resulting series of albums over the next five years proved conclusively
that outside of Charlie Parker, Konitz was the most consistently
creative alto saxophonist of their generation.
Sixty-eight this October, Konitz continues to occupy a pre-eminent
position in the jazz saxophone hierarchy. A restless musical spirit, he
has always been ready to explore new territory.
If you doubt that assertion just listen to the recently issued 1959
live date recorded at the Half-Note in New York and compare it with the
various and varied duets album on the Paddlewheel Label or the Broadway
Music sessions which will form the basis of the altoist's performance at
the Glasgow Jazz Festival on Monday night. These three albums spanning
well over 30 years, should be required listening for aspiring players of
all instruments. At the Half-Note, joined by tenorist Warne Marsh and a
rhythm section of Bill Evans, Jimmy Garrison and Paul Motian (who is
also the moving force behind the Broadway Music collaboration) Konitz
plays stunningly.
The two recent albums display a tonally tougher Konitz -- more angular
and abrupt, revealing denser configurations of ideas.One thing is
certain -- few musicians have been as consistent in terms of quality
over the long haul as has Lee Konitz. Perhaps he can shed some light on
the music from that autumnal Glasgow evening in 1958. I'd really like to
know because I'm positive that there was a whole lot more to the
experience than just a faint memory of fish and chips.

JUST when they are entangled in a nasty bout of fratricide, the Tories
have received some bad news on the likely performance of the economy
over the next 18 months. Not all of the news is bad, for the forecast of
falling growth reinforces the case for avoiding higher interest rates,
though were sterling to go on weakening some short-term increase might
be unavoidable. It could probably soon be reversed. Although most
informed commentators still tend to be gloomy about the likely interest
rate trend, the political pressures on the Chancellor are such as to
confirm his judgment that UK rates may have peaked. Within months, if Mr
Clarke remains lucky, the speculation about the onset of cheaper money
will begin.
That would be just as well since the bad news is that the need for
more public borrowing is unavoidable -- the deficit in public finances
is set to worsen by at least #1500m, as tax revenues come in below last
November's expectation. The extent to which this happens reduces the
Chancellor's ability to deliver lower taxes in time to affect electoral
fortunes. He might, of course, still abandon a balanced budget to create
room for lower income tax, but that could damage his credibility more
than anything else. There remains the possibility that he might be able
to juggle the revenues so as to permit some reductions in income tax,
but there is no doubting the degree to which he is strapped. The chance
of people feeling good from paying less tax is slight.
The economy's predicted slowing means too that fewer new jobs will be
created in the months ahead, and unemployment will continue to flatten
its downward curve -- and might even cease falling altogether. The
inflation picture is set to worsen too, if not by too much and probably
not for too long: the world economy is in a deflationary mode which
shows little indication of changing. Any short-term movements are not
likely to be to the Government's political advantage. It is true that
the balance of payments deficit will continue to shrink but that, though
welcome, is not the sort of trend to impact on popular opinion. More
might come from the Treasury's confirmation of building society
forecasts of improving house prices, but the increase predicted is very
modest, and will not be enough to eliminate negative equity for many who
are enduring it. The Government has just committed itself to further
efforts to expand home ownership, but the day may well have passed when
that is an electoral advantage to the Tories, whose support has been
damaged by the attacks on tax relief on mortgage interest payments. In
short, most of the forecast movements work against rather than for the
Government. One major imponderable is public confidence and the extent
to which it might still change and alter the whole political climate.
The fact is that the Government is presiding over a good economic
experience. Manufacturing is beginning to expand (along with some new
investment in it). The performance of exports is excellent and helps to
explain how the recovery is statistically demonstrable, yet unfelt by
many domestic consumers. By next year, even if tax on incomes is not
reduced, earnings will increase in a modest but real way to allow more
retail spending. On that, the Government's fortunes now rest (unless
everything is blown by the leadership contest in the next month).
Perhaps only a new Government, and the stimulus such a change always
provides, can deliver the elusive sense of confidence.

<HEADLINE>Questions for Mr Lang</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<ARTICLETYPE>LEADER</ARTICLETYPE>
<RECORDNO>977649790</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG is an astute politician but even the cleverest
practitioner can succumb to the temptation to be just a little too
cunning. For the past two years the Scottish Tories have had a barn door
to aim at in the shape of the reprehensible behaviour of Labour
councillors in Monklands district. Any criticism they produced could
hardly fail to miss the target and the merest mention of Monklands was
sufficient to bring a smile to wan Tory faces, even as far south as
Dover. The Labour Party in Scotland, which must have been well aware of
what was going on in Monklands despite its own unimpressive
investigation in 1993, has been desperate to clear up the mess and move
on. Labour's repeated requests for an official inquiry by the Scottish
Office met with rejection. Show us your evidence, said Mr Lang, with his
eyes rolling innocently to the ceiling. Eventually Labour produced the
evidence in the form of the report earlier this month by Professor
Robert Black. The suspension by Labour of Monklands councillors from the
new North Lanarkshire authority yesterday is sensible, and moral,
politics, especially when taken together with earlier action against
relevant councillors by the party in Scotland. Belatedly, Labour has at
least started the mucking out of its Lanarkshire stables and there can
be no question of its determination to do the job properly.
Given this background a visitor from Mars (or Dover) would have been
surprised at the howls of outrage in the Commons yesterday when Mr Lang
announced a full-scale statutory inquiry into the activities of the
Monklands councillors. True, it is a narrowly based inquiry destined to
focus particularly on the council's failure to comply with its statutory
duties in respect of proper conduct in the hiring of staff. It is, none
the less, a necessary inquiry, which is what Labour has demanded for
years. Mr Lang, who had something of the exaggerated innocence of a man
selling suspect oriental rugs yesterday, is accused of initially
refusing to hold an inquiry for two years to prolong Labour's agony, and
then slipping an inquiry into view at the very moment when the Tories
could best do with some political ammunition against their opponents.
The last charge is bogus; all politicians would choose the most
propitious opportunity to embarrass their foes. The allegation that the
Scottish Secretary has deliberately delayed holding an inquiry for two
years when he had reasonable grounds to suspect that one was justified
is more serious.
Mr Lang's line is that the Black report has changed everything. It
provides the evidence which he needed before he could take action. A
heated Mrs Helen Liddell doubted this yesterday. Mr Lang's reply to the
charge that he had allowed the situation to fester to gain political
advantage was to say that he had to view it in the light of statutory
requirements and he is now of the opinion that an inquiry would be
appropriate. But Mr Lang admitted that he had been aware of certain
allegations for some time. If this is the case, certain questions
follow. Mr Lang really must say what allegations he had heard, when he
became aware of them, and why he did not act. The statutory provisions
relating to employment requirements do not ring true as the catalyst for
the inquiry. Surely Mr Lang has heard more serious allegations than
those? As for Mr Allan Stewart, with his insinuations of dirty work in
other Labour councils, he must surely take his Prime Minister's advice,
and put up or shut up.

THE stock market again fell sharply yesterday in response to the
mounting political crisis in the Conservative Party, and is now about
120 points below last Thursday's close just before the Prime Minister
dropped his bombshell.
There were no nasty shocks in the Treasury's summer forecasts. Most of
the revisions had been foreseen, but eyebrows were raised at the
forecast of underlying inflation falling back to 2.5% by the end of next
year. This is 1% below the Bank of England's projection.
Sterling, gilts, and equities have all had a political price to pay,
but yesterday the first two held steady, though today's #2500m gilt
auction could hardly have been worse timed.
The big fear in the City is that John Major's gamble will backfire and
result in a relaxation of fiscal policy in pursuit of significant tax
cuts. It was notable yesterday that the present Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, claimed to be well on course for tax cuts,
despite upward revisions to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement.
It is clear that an easier fiscal stance would be damaging to gilts
and sterling, but equities are potential beneficiaries, especially
consumer stocks whose prospects would be improved if tax cuts put more
money into the pockets of the spending classes.
So it is a little surprising that the stock market should have fallen
so far so fast. The FTSE-100 share index, which sustained its biggest
one-day fall for 16 months on Monday, dropped a further 30.5 points
yesterday to 3282.7. It would have been more but for the Americans and
Japanese reaching agreement in the protracted car talks hours before the
deadline for sanctions.
Very little business is actually being conducted. In times of great
uncertainty institutions tend to sit on their cash piles waiting
clarification.
Nothing could be more uncertain than the prospect of a radical change
in economic policy resulting from a struggle for power in the ruling
party or ultimately the victory of the Opposition in a premature General
Election.
The main features of the summer forecast are higher inflation, lower
growth, and a larger PSBR. The Treasury expects underlying inflation of
3% in the final quarter of this year, quite close to the Bank of
England's projection of 3.25% and May's outturn of 2.7%.
Much more controversial is the forecast that inflation will be only
2.5% in the final quarter of next year, in the middle of the target
range.
The Treasury seems to regard the extra inflation being caused by the
weakness of sterling as a one-off phenomenon which will not have
second-round effects. The Bank of England takes a diametrically opposite
view. Hence the difference of opinion between the Chancellor and Eddie
George, the Governor of the Bank of England, over interest rates.
With the Treasury forecasting that the economy will continue to grow
at above its trend rate of 2.25%, it is difficult to see how the
Treasury's end-96 inflation forecast can be achieved without a
substantial increase in rates.
Indeed the highly rated economics team at City stockbrokers Goldman
Sachs is forecasting inflation of 4% in the middle of next year,
subsiding to 3.5% by the end, provided base rates are increased by 1%
over the next six to nine months.
There is a widespread suspicion that Kenneth Clarke will not be too
upset if he misses the 2.5% inflation target so long as above-trend
growth and tax cuts restore the feel good factor.
Worse, though the present Chancellor may be straying from the straight
and narrow of fiscal and monetary rectitude, other contenders for his
office should there be a new Prime Minister might well turn out to be
much greater sinners in the eyes of the City.
Arising from the reduction in this year's growth forecast from 3.25%
to 3% and the projection of a 2.75% rate next year, the Treasury now
expects higher public borrowing than it did at the time of the November
Budget.
The 1995/6 PSBR has slipped by a couple of billion to #23.6bn and
1996/7's by three billion to #16.1bn (despite finding an extra #1000m of
privatisation receipts from nuclear power).
As a result the public finances will no longer be in balance by
1998/9, the reason presumably why the Treasury now talks of bringing the
PSBR back ''towards'' rather ''to'' balance.
However, the continued improvement in the public finances undoubtedly
leaves the Chancellor with scope to cut taxes. On the revised
projections the 1996/7 PSBR will be down to 2% of gross domestic
product, comfortably below the Maastricht target of 3%.
The risk of course is that tax cuts will fuel a boom, repeating the
mistake of Nigel Lawson in the eighties. Clarke admitted yesterday that
they had not been factored into the Treasury's forecast of 3% growth in
consumer spending next year. But then whoever wins the leadership battle
political considerations are bound to rule the roost.

payment of #134,000 as well as agreeing a two-year consultancy
arrangement which could pay up to #78,000 annually. Mr Fidler left at
his own request.
The sums are in addition to the emoluments of #174,000, including a
#32,000 pension fund contribution for the financial year to March 1995.
In the annual report, chairman Sir Alick Rankin said that the early
weeks of the current trading year have provided some evidence that the

Women need better advice from doctors on the use of HRT, argues ANN
SHAW.
ONCE the menopause was a taboo subject. Today bookshelves are bulging
with volumes about it. You'd think it's just been discovered. In fact,
many feminists, including Germaine Greer, fear that the whole process is
in grave danger of being medicalised. What should be a natural
ageing-condition has suddenly become big business for the pharmaceutical
companies. Or has it?
Are women being ''encouraged'' to go on Hormone Replacement Therapy
(HRT) -- the buzz treatment of the 90s health scene -- simply to boost
drug profits, or is it really an elixir for the second half of life?
Teresa Gorman MP -- once involved in the Amarant Trust which promoted
HRT -- and television doctor Miriam Stoppard, are flag-waving supporters
of HRT.
Certainly amongst women in the 40-plus age bracket it's a major
talking point. Get any group of women together today and it's one
subject that will crop up as soon as health is discussed.
So, what do you do? Talk to your GP? He or she will smile sweetly,
give you a few facts then say: ''The decision is yours.'' Thanks. What
we want is someone to make the decision for us. After all, we are not
medically qualified.
So it was with some interest I picked up Sandra Coney's new book The
Menopause Industry (Women's Press, #8.99). I was optimistic that this
might be a valuable contribution to the debate. Unfortunately, it
rapidly became obvious that it is a diatribe against HRT.
For example, there are over 4,000,000 women aged between 45 and 60 in
the UK, and, Coney claims, large numbers are being persuaded to take
hormones. The facts are that less than 10% of women take HRT. Hardly
''large numbers''.
Her book is riddled with case histories of women who have had bad
experiences of both women's health-screening and HRT. Yet there is also
plenty of anecdotal evidence that HRT is beneficial.
However, Coney fails to produce examples of women who have benefited
from it.
So, who is Sandra Coney? She is a New Zealand journalist who made her
name by exposing the maltreatment of women with cervical cancer at the
National Women's Hospital in Auckland eight years ago.
Now she has turned her attention to the ''menopause industry'',
claiming that there is a frightening absence of any ethical regulations
governing the creation of ''cures'' for the menopause, and the
frightening growth of a billion-dollar industry allegedly based on
patient disinformation. Alarming stuff, you've got to admit.
But what are the facts? Most drugs have side-effects, and the longer
they are used the greater the potential damage. That much is undisputed.
The debate over HRT revolves around the fact that while its short-term
use for menopausal symptoms is accepted as a low risk and a highly
effective way to eliminate hot flushes and night sweats, and reduce the
risk of heart disease and osteoporosis in the long run, using it for
more than five to 10 years carries a risk of breast cancer, according to
some studies.
But there have been no long term studies on the use of HRT amongst
older women with a control group of women of similar age in good health
who have not taken it. That's the crux of the matter.
That's not to denounce HRT as a drug dreamed up by male-orientated
pharmaceutical companies simply to make a quick buck, then hyped up by
the media, and doctors.
A much more useful discussion on the subject is to be found in Dr
Christiane Northrup's book Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom (Piatkus,
#25). She is a holistic physician and a member of the Natural Healing
and Health Advisory Board in the United States. She says about half her
post-menopausal patients are on an HRT regimen.
''HRT needs to be kept in perspective. It is not the only way to
alleviate the problems that some (not all) women experience,'' says
Northrup.
She says the current ''medicalisation'' of the menopause has been so
successful that many women's own menopausal wisdom and trust in their
bodies to remain healthy during this natural life stage is almost
non-existent.
''Since I don't believe that the menopause is a deficiency disease, a
woman's desire to try HRT is the number one reason why I prescribe it.''
Given the current link between research funding, drug company profits
and the medical profession, she adds that it is unlikely that the kind
of ''proof'' required to assure women that they can remain healthy
without hormones will be forthcoming.
''Because we have no large-scale, unbiased medical research studies on
healthy women who do not take HRT, I cannot cite research to help women
make the choice to avoid or go on HRT. I have only the 'anecdotal'
experience of caring for the women in my practice who have decided to
avoid it with my support.''

DAWSON International's new chairman sees no need for lengthy
management contracts, like those which cost the troubled group #2.17m in
golden handshakes to former directors.
Speaking after the company's annual meeting in Edinburgh, Derek
Finlay, asked if he resented having to make the hefty payments, said:
''I have never had a management contract in my life and I don't have one
now.
''If you do well, you are paid well. If you don't, you go.''
Earlier, the honorary life president of the Pringle group, Sir Alan
Smith, told a surprisingly subdued meeting: ''The shareholders and
employees have had a rough ride in recent years. The share price is down
by more than half and the dividend cut by two-thirds.
''However, I would suggest we must forget, if not forgive, the cost of
the mistakes of recent management and look to the future.''
Revealing that the payoffs had been agreed after ''tough''
negotiations between Dawson's lawyers and those of the former directors,
Mr Finlay said: ''If you have a legal contract, the only way the company
is relieved of any financial payments is if he (the director) walks out
voluntarily. In this case it did not happen.''
News earlier this month of the former directors' payoffs whipped up a
storm of protest, coming hard on the heels of the textiles group's
announcement of more than 400 Scottish job losses.
Former US head Philip Kemp, whose departure in April last year was
prompted by the poor performance of Dawson's American businesses, is
receiving a #1.36m payoff, including pension contributions of #842,000
over seven years.
Former chairman Sir Ronald Miller, who was ousted in a boardroom coup
at the end of March, will receive compensation of #378,000.
His payoff is equivalent to about two years' salary, as is that made
to former managing director Nick Kuenssberg. Mr Kuenssberg, also forced
out when Mr Finlay became chairman, negotiated a one-off payment of
#308,000.
John Embrey, who was succeeded as finance director by George
Fairweather last August, was awarded compensation of #117,000. He
formally retires next month.
However, in spite of Mr Finlay's personal views on management
contracts, managing director Peter Forrest's contract entitles him to
three years' notice of termination.
Finance director George Fairweather is entitled to two years' notice.
Both men joined the board prior to March's senior management changes.
Following the boardroom coup, Dawson's remuneration committee has
ensured no director or senior executive is now given a rolling contract
of more than two years' duration.
Mr Finlay told yesterday's meeting that, in the 90 days since he took
control, the new top management team had made significant progress in
turning Dawson around.
He referred to the recent disposals of Dawson Home Fashions, the
loss-making US shower curtain and related products business, to Springs
Industries for about $41.4m (#26.2m) and of Premier Fabrics for #2.6m.
Negotiations relating to the sale of six of Dawson's nine remaining
fleece and jersey plants in the US are progressing well, according to Mr
Finlay.
However, the chairman hinted that further job losses could be on the
way.
He told shareholders that the focus on improving Dawson's competitive
position and restructuring to match capacity and product demand would
have to continue.
Speaking after the meeting, he said: ''I cannot ever say we have
reached the end of the road. We have to continually strive for operating
efficiencies and lower unit labour costs.''
As always, Dawson is hoping for a ''mighty cold winter'', the absence
of which exacerbated last year's problems.

DEEDEE CUDDIHY finds the legend of a native American Princess has this
year sparked an animated movie, a play, and a tourism opportunity for
Gravesend.
ONE thing's for sure: Gravesend isn't going to let Rochester get its
hands on Pocahontas.
Pocahontas, you may recall, was the seventeenth-century native
American princess from Virginia who may -- or may not -- have saved the
life of the English colonist John Smith, and who less famously went on
to marry John Rolfe, another colonist. While on a trade mission to
England with her husband and baby son, Pocahontas took ill and died
during the first leg of her return journey to America. She was buried at
Gravesend, Kent, on March 21, 1617.
Since her death, Pocahontas has been the subject of numerous plays,
books and works of art. Now, during what is believed to be the 400th
anniversary of her birth, Walt Disney Pictures has made a full-length
animated film based on the Pocahontas legend. It will open here in
October.
If ever the town of Gravesend had an opportunity to cash in on its
Pocahontas connection, the forthcoming Disney movie is surely it. The
company is already predicting that Pocahontas will become the movie
event of 1995.
So is Gravesend gearing itself up for a massive influx of visitors,
all desperate to see where this latest Disney character is buried, and
probably just as desperate to shell out for any number of Pocahontas
souvenirs?
Not exactly. Gravesend, you see, doesn't even feature in the new
movie, despite the fact that Pocahontas's life ended there at the early
age of 22.
Surprisingly, although Gravesend can boast a statue of the princess,
plus two commemorative stained glass windows; a mural; tour boat the
Princess Pocahontas; and the recently-conceived Pocahontas Day, when
local people dress up in native American costume, there's not so much as
a tea towel for tourists to buy and take away as a souvenir of their
visit. Gravesend council official Shirley Whatmough admitted: ''We just
haven't got the resources to exploit the fact that Gravesend was
Pocahontas's final resting place.''
Pocahontas wasn't the only famous person with Gravesend connections.
Charles Dickens stayed in the area in the final 15 years of his life,
but the nearby city of Rochester got in first with its now
world-renowned Charles Dickens Centre.
Fortunately for Gravesend a bona fide descendent of Pocahontas turned
up earlier this year in Rose Powhatan, and agreed to act as cultural
adviser to a respected local drama group, the Resolution Theatre
Company. They are bringing their version of the Pocahontas story to this
year's Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
Powhatan, ateacher and an artist who is in Britain for a year on a
Fulbright Scholarship, is annoyed that Disney serves up the story of a
romantic involvement between the princess and Captain John Smith (voiced
by Mel Gibson) as a statement of fact.
''Pocahontas was only a girl of 14 at the time,'' Powhatan protests,
''while John Smith was twice that age. Disney has made her look older
and him younger, so that the idea of a romance is more acceptable.''
But at least some people are inclined to side with Walt Disney on this
one. Songwriters John Davenport and Eddie Cooley wrote Fever in the
belief that Pocahontas and Smith had the hots for each other. As Peggy
Lee memorably first purred in 1956: ''Captain Smith and Pocahontas/Had a
very mad affair/When her daddy tried to kill him/She said: ''Daddy, oh,
don't you dare!''
Maybe Gravesend should consider getting that printed on a tea
towel.

* STRESS caused by increased workload is the reason given why almost
half of doctors would switch to another career if possible. They were
questioned in a survey carried out by GP magazine. Out of 811 GP's who
took part, 45% were considering a change. One doctor said: ''The
pressures are increasing and it seems it can only get worse. GPs do not
seem to get the respect they used to: everybody seems to want things
done better and quicker than they used to.''
* IF you take the Pill you are less likely to get ovarian or
endometrial cancer. A new long-term study confirms the protective effect
of the Pill in certain cancers, according to the British Journal of
Cancer. The study by the Oxford Family Planning Association involved
17,000 women followed for up to 25 years.
They found that women who had never used the Pill were nearly four
times as likely to develop ovarian cancer as those who had used it for
longer than four years. However, this protective effect wore off within
eight years of stopping the oral contraceptive.
* NOW for the bad news: yet another study confirms that smoking causes
breast cancer. Research found that women who smoked for over 30 years
have an increased risk of the disease. The prevalence of breast cancer
amongst non-smokers is 7%, against 15% cent who smoke. Smokers are also
likely to develop the disease earlier; on average they were eight years
younger than non-smokers.
* GIVING children extra calcium in the hope of them developing strong
bones is not as effective as regular exercise.
A study of 1359 children aged seven to 11 years found that only
exercise increases bone mineral density.
Researchers at The Rotterdam Medical School found no link between high
calcium dietary intake and stronger bones, according to the Journal of
Epidemiology and Community Health.
* THE National Back Pain Association has produced a booklet on the
common causes of back pain. For a copy send a #2 donation to the
Information Department, National Back Pain Association, 16 Elmtree Road,
Teddington, Middlesex TW11 8ST.
Meanwhile a new, useful self-help guide on joint stiffness is Body in
Action. Available from Penguin, price #5.99p.
* WE are constantly told that we should eat five portions of fruit and
vegetables a day. But what constitutes a portion? Now the Department of
Health have drawn up clear and unambiguous advice: one portion is a
large slice of a fruit such as a pineapple; a whole banana or apple; two
plums and kiwi fruits and a cupful of raspberries of grapes.
For green and root vegetables and for pulses (including baked beans) a
portion is recommended as ''two serving spoonfuls'' with three spoonfuls
for peas, sweetcorn and other small vegetables. Also a bowlful of salad
is needed too.

Pamela Smith is a fitness trainer who makes no excuses for injuries.
Judy Mackie reports that rehabilitating accident victims and reading the
riot act to flagging footballers is all part of her job.
PAMELA Smith's job requires a chameleon personality. A soft-spoken
Geordie with a determination of steel, the Aberdeen-based personal
fitness specialist is constantly changing tactics by the hour to suit
the many needs of her clients.
Whether it's reading the riot act to flagging footballers; sharing a
joke with her aqua-aerobics class, or sympathising with a frustrated
sports lover suffering a painful injury, 48-year-old Pamela has the
knack of knowing just which approach will spur a person to achieve his
or her personal goal.
A former nurse, she fulfils a unique role in Grampian as the first
fitness trainer with a special interest in rehabilitation. Taking over
where the physiotherapist leaves off, she has among her clients car
accident victims, post-operative patients, arthritis sufferers and
injured sports professionals.
''Physios do an excellent job, but they are over-stretched and the
time they have to spend with patients is very limited. I can give a
person all the time they need and help them get back to full fitness, if
that's possible,'' she says.
Pamela was the first person to introduce deep-water training to
Scotland -- an idea she picked up at a conference in Nashville -- which
she uses regularly to train and rehabilitate players from Aberdeen
Football Club at the RGIT Survival Centre.
A particularly intensive type of training, it involves ''running'' and
non-weight bearing activity in deep water, wearing an aqua vest -- a
procedure which often has even the fittest footballers begging for
mercy, according to Pamela. But perseverance is well worthwhile, as both
Alex McLeish and Eoin Jess discovered after the technique helped them
overcome ankle and leg injuries.
''Training with me is very tough and I make no excuse for injuries.
Eoin had a broken leg in plaster, but I told him that wouldn't stop him
going into water -- he just had to dry out the inside of the plaster
with a hairdryer later,'' she says with a laugh.
Tough she may sound, but Pamela has a deeply caring nature.
Hilary Buchan, a 40-year-old public relations officer at Grampian
Television, says she wishes everyone could have a Pamela Smith to help
them overcome their injuries.
''I heard about Pamela when I was recovering from a hip replacement
operation and we've been working together since last November. If I
hadn't met her I think I would have ended up in the nearest river, I was
so frustrated with myself.''
Hilary, a keen golfer, swimmer and hockey instructor, was horrified at
the extent her leg muscles had wasted after the operation to remove her
arthritic right hip joint. Two 15-minute sessions a week with a
physiotherapist were not enough, in her opinion, to restore her to her
previously fit state.
''If it had not been for Pamela, I probably would have charged ahead
on my own, either getting nowhere or setting myself back months. I see
her twice a week for two hours in the gym, and once a week for
hydrotherapy, and despite me having to go back for a further operation
in February, she is helping me regain my muscle strength in both legs
and in the upper part of my body.''
Pamela is also interested in helping people with particular health
conditions achieve their optimum fitness and gives lectures on exercise
for those suffering from high blood pressure, asthma, diabetis, HIV Aids
and cancer, as well as on keeping fit in old age and during pregnancy.
After leaving nursing to bring up her children, Jane (23) and James
(19), Pamela achieved a science degree at the age of 38, which helped
expand her knowledge of physiology. Now self-employed she is based at
the Bon Accord Sports Medicine Centre, which specialises in sports
injuries and physiotherapy, and whose director is her husband, Francis,
a consultant in charge of Nuclear Medicine and MRI at Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary.
Another aspect of Pamela's work is one-to-one training with people who
simply want to be fitter. She begins with a free screening session to
assess their health and fitness levels (thereafter lessons are #15 each)
and then, providing they are committed, will tailor-make a programme to
suit their age, abilities, and lifestyle. And she will accompany her
clients to ensure they are exercising correctly.
She has also recently become involved in the increasingly popular
practice of corporate fitness training, which involves employees
exercising in company time, with the blessing -- and she insists,
participation -- of their employers.
''The one thing I can't do is promise to make someone slim. People ask
me for advice on spot-reducing, but if I knew the secret I'd have the
tiniest backside and waist and biggest chest in Aberdeen,'' she jokes.
As it is she is content to be ''the same weight and size I was at 14''
and puts her supple figure down to regular exercise and a reasonably
healthy diet.
With around eight fitness classes a week, on top of numerous
individual training sessions with clients, she is showing no signs of
slowing down. Pamela is interested in women's fitness and health,
particularly how they respond to new challanges in middle age and
menopause. Her own early experiences of menopause have left her
exhilarated, rather than exhausted.
''People perceive the menopause as a very negative experience, and
it's time we started being more positive. I believe regular exercise is
helping me handle the situation, and I'm thinking of devising a
programme especially for menopausal women.''
And somehow, despite a seemingly watertight schedule, this determined
lady is sure to find the time to do it.

A SENIOR figure in Roman Catholic education has been appointed to a
new post which will involve spreading the word about denominational
schools doing a good job.
The Catholic Church in Scotland has announced that Mr John Oates, who
took early retirement from the post of headteacher of St Modan's High in
Stirling in March, is to be the first field officer for the Catholic
Education Commission.
He said yesterday that Catholic schools should be up front about their
achievements rather than defensive when they came under scrutiny.
And he accepted the case for school closures as long as they could be
justified, and good provision of Catholic education could be maintained.
The Catholic Education Commission is the most important advisory body
to the Bishops on Catholic education, and, at their recent conference,
they unanimously approved the creation of the post.
Scotland's senior Catholic figure, Cardinal Thomas Winning, who is
also president of the commission, said Mr Oates would have an important
job as the link with other Catholic educational bodies.
Mr Oates said yesterday: ''The commission is breaking new ground. The
job is recognition of the fact that it is getting involved much more in
the delivery of services to Catholic schools, and in big developments
such as the programme for five to 14-year-olds and the faith and
learning initiative.
''Perhaps most importantly we need to provide support for teachers in
schools. Cardinal Winning is very strong on this. Teachers have to feel
they are being supported.
''There is a need to instil confidence in schools and teachers in the
quality of work they are doing. Sometimes they feel they are constantly
under the lens and are always having to defend themselves.
''They need to promote themselves because they are doing a lot of good
work.''
Mr Oates, who had been in teaching for 36 years, said local government
reform would be one of the big challenges facing him in his new,
part-time post.
Although the Government had agreed under pressure from Catholic
leaders to amend the law and protect secondary-school catchment areas
which had been under threat because of new council boundaries, Mr Oates
said the Church would remain ''very vigilant.''
It plans to have a representative on each of the 32 new councils to
put the Church's case on education matters.
Some Catholic secondaries in urban areas which suffer from low pupil
rolls because of demographic changes will face the threat of closure,
particularly since the new councils, which will have smaller capital
bases, will be pressed to cut costs and balance the books.
Mr Oates said: ''The Church does not man the barricades against every
school closure. Where there is a case for closure it has been reasonable
in working with authorities and I imagine that will continue to be the
case.
''When the facts are staring you in the face it does not make much
sense to defend every instance. The Church will continue to fight for
the maintenance of the good provision of Catholic education.''

YOUNG people throughout Britain and the world's poorest countries feel
the biggest threat to their future is the destruction of the
environment, it was claimed last night.
Development aid organisation VSO, which helps developing countries
improve food production, was launching a week-long programme throughout
Scotland and the UK of awareness of the world's most pressing problems.
Its director, Mr David Green, said in Edinburgh that the continuing
effort to improve forestry preservation and regeneration and fishing
stocks was essential in underlining the work of the service, which is
embarking on a major fund-raising exercise through volunteers in 57
countries to supplement its annual aid budget of #24m.
Referring to a recent survey of 2000 young people, he said 77% felt
the world would be a more dangerous place in the next century, with
almost the same percentage thinking that pollution could be the biggest
threat.
The theme for VSO Week is natural resources and, appropriately,
volunteers who have returned from abroad -- including 122 from Scotland
-- met at the Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh.
Among them was volunteer worker Ms Adrienne Wilson, who now works with
the Central Scotland Countryside Trust. An agricultural degree student,
she spent more than three years in northern Nepal, working on forest
projects.
For her, she said, the most satisfying aspect was that the Nepalese
were becoming aware of the need to protect and regenerate forest areas;
however, much more work had to be done there as in other areas
throughout the world.

SCOTLAND could end up talking itself into a housing slump fuelled by
scare stories from London-based media, it was claimed yesterday.
The Edinburgh Solicitors' Property Centre called its first news
conference in 24 years to allay fears of negative equity and present a
new report with an upbeat picture of the Scottish housing market.
ESPC chairman George Clark said the volume of misinformation, based on
serious problems experienced in the south of England, had reached such a
level that it had been decided to take action.
''We have had major building societies reporting falling prices. We
have had London-based brokers telling us that negative equity north of
the Border is rocketing upwards.
''There has been far too much gloom and despondency about the property
market of late. It is misplaced. The picture is not nearly so grim as
many would have us believe.
''We do not have a problem in Scotland with negative equity, which in
any sensible definition is dependent entirely on house prices falling,''
Mr Clark said.
He said where people owed more to the bank or building society than
their house was worth, it was generally due to them borrowing more than
100% on the loan or falling into problems with repayments.
''Scotland's property market is definitely not in the doldrums but our
fear at this time is that all this doom and gloom can become a
self-fulfilling prophecy,'' he added.
Mr Clark said that in all its 20 years of monitoring sales and prices,
the ESPC had always seen yearly increases. A similar picture of relative
stability, but with some local variations, was reported by solicitors'
property centres in Glasgow, Dundee, and Aberdeen.
Although overall ESPC sales fell by 15% last year, there was still a
1.8% increase in the average price of properties in the last six months
compared to the same period in 1994.
''It is not a huge increase but it is radically different from the
position painted by the London-based media,'' he said.
Mr Clark said the Department of the Environment was one of the worst
culprits. Its widely-reported comments that cases of negative equity in
Scotland had risen from 12,000 to 85,000 in the first quarter of this
year were ''absurd and palpably wrong''. Following representations from
the Scottish Office, it had now agreed to re-examine how it examined its
statistics.
''The Scottish market has always been distinctive. We have not seen
the boom and bust pattern experienced in the south of England but the
danger is that people may start to believe that this is happening
here,'' he added.
Mr Clark said there was a slowness in the market due to people wanting
to sell before they bought. However, the single most important
constraint was a dearth of suitable properties to buy.
He said there were real anxieties about the state of the economy and
job security but these should not be confused with the slump and
negative equity in the English housing market.
There were no signs that Scots were moving away from home ownership to
renting since, under current rules, most leases were for a minimum of
six months but not more than 12.
''I think people are right to consider the options. Generally, a
Scotsman buys his house as a home and people do not want to set up a
relationship and have children and then find they have to move,'' he
said.
Asked about those who have fears for job security, Mr Clark said: ''If
your job is not secure, and if you feel your job is not secure, you
should not be buying a house at all.''
Mr David Jenkins, chief economist at Bank of Scotland International,
said the Scottish housing market had always been very different from
that in the south-east of England.
Levels of home ownership in Scotland had risen from 36% in 1980 to 55%
in 1993. ''Scottish people didn't have the same degree of house price
inflation and people didn't borrow anywhere near as much,'' he added.

Secondary school pupils could be deprived of some courses next session
after Strathclyde region reacted with ''great regret and much
reluctance'' to an equal pay ruling which went against it.
The education authority warned that the implications of the ruling
could threaten teachers' job security.
An industrial tribunal recently ruled that nine out of 10 unpromoted
teachers employed by the authority were entitled to equal pay with
principal teachers because they were undertaking the same duties.
Strathclyde is to appeal against the ruling in a higher court but it
has moved to avoid further cases from unpromoted teachers claiming they
are carrying out principal teacher duties and to limit the value of
claims from those already doing promoted teachers' jobs.
The authority's deputy director of education responsible for
personnel, Mr Keir Bloomer, has instructed secondary heads to ensure
that no unpromoted member of staff carries out principal teacher duties.
In a letter to head teachers, he writes: ''I must stress that all
offers by staff who are not principal teachers to assume voluntary
duties commensurate with those of principal teachers must be rejected
forthwith.''
Where these duties cannot be allocated to members of senior management
such as assistant heads or where more junior staff would have to carry
out principal teacher duties ''the activity or curricular area will
require to be terminated,'' writes Mr Bloomer.
That could lead to fewer options for pupils in smaller departments
such as computing, art, music, and geography, where the problem has
arisen because principal teachers have not been appointed but subject
teachers have been doing an equivalent job.
Mr Bloomer tells head teachers: ''The number of equal pay claims which
are being lodged in this increasingly litigious area, and the cost to
the authority if it is unable to defend successfully these actions,
means that service delivery as well as the security of jobs is now being
threatened.''
However, the general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers'
Association, which represented the 10 teachers before the tribunal and
also succeeded in an earlier equal pay case, last night said it was a
''shambles of Strathclyde's making''.
Mr Alan Lamont threatened the authority with a mass tribunal next
session unless it stopped what he described as a ''nonsense'' and
''penny pinching''.
The Educational Institute of Scotland is also collecting evidence from
teachers with the aim of taking equal pay claims against Strathclyde,
which provides education for half of Scotland's school pupils.
Mr Lamont said the SSTA had learned of one school in Strathclyde in
which eight departments were run by assistant principal teachers.
''These are people who do not have to go to a tribunal to prove their
case. They should be paid for doing the job and that is that.''
He accused Strathclyde of making matters worse by giving secondary
heads considerable discretion to use a promotion points system which
discriminated against subject departments.
Some heads left assistant principal teachers in charge of bigger
departments so that they could appoint an extra assistant head, he said.

Six Degrees of Separation (15) directed by Fred Schepisi, Filmhouse,
Edinburgh.
Beyond Rangoon (12) directed by John Boorman.
Congo (12) directed by Frank Marshall.
* An entertaining affair * A view of two worlds * Things that go bump
in the night -- William Russell previews the latest films.
WITTY, elegant, impeccably performed, Six Degrees of Separation
directed by  Fred Schepisi turns John Guare's successful Broadway play
into a film of rare quality. It is story about deception, about people's
willingness to believe in something they know cannot possibly be true
because belief is essential to their wellbeing.
The Kittredges -- Ouisa (Stockard Channing, recreating the role she
played on stage in New York and London) and Flan (Donald Sutherland),
both on cracking form -- are wealthy New York art dealers entertaining a
wealthy South African, Ian McKellan, whose money they need to finance a
dodgy art sale, when Paul (Will Smith), a handsome, well-spoken black
boy, bursts into their apartment. He claims to have been mugged in the
street below and, because he is a friend of their children, who are at
Harvard, has come for help. They believe him.
The boy is nicely dressed, clearly cultured, knows lots of intimate
details about their lives, and asks only to borrow $50  to pay for a
cheap hotel room until his father turns up.
When he confides that his father is Sidney Poitier all reservations
vanish, the wound is patched, they invite him to stay, he insists on
cooking dinner, and a marvellous time is had by all. In the middle of
the night the Kitteridges hear a noise from his room, investigate, and
discover all is not as it appeared.
Next day they meet their friends, Kitty and Larkin (Mary Beth Hurt and
Bruce Davison), with the merry cry -- ''Have we got a story to tell
you!''  ''Have we got one to tell you!'' they reply. Paul has visited
them too. The film starts jerkily with some misjudged, confusing
flashbacks, but once the two couples start trying to find Paul to
discover how he came to know all about them, Schepisi gains control and
it glides smoothly to its climax.
These are people rich in worldly goods, but poor in spirit, who latch
on to any fresh thrill that comes their way to give some meaning to
lives devoted to being in the right place, doing the right thing, and
wearing the right clothes.
Will Smith, making amends for the awful Bad Boys, is a plausible
charmer, who wants only to belong somewhere, while in the course of
their search the hard-hearted Ouisa discovers feelings she did not
realise she possessed. Channing and Sutherland give the performances of
their lives. A truly civilised, entertaining affair.
John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is an exciting chase thriller which
aspires to higher things and falls between two stools. It is set in
Burma in 1988 when there was a popular rising against the ruling
military junta led by Aung San Suu Kyi. She won the 1990 general
election, but the generals refused to recognise the result, and she has
been under house arrest ever since. Boorman's aim is to draw attention
to this state of affairs.
A young American widow, Patricia Arquette, is holidaying in Rangoon
trying to forget a hideous family tragedy -- her husband and young son
were murdered by an intruder. Unable to sleep, she goes out for a
late-night stroll and blunders into the famous confrontation when Aung
San Suu Kyi defied the junta's troops, ignored their guns, and joined
her supporters. In the crush Arquette's passport is stolen and her tour
group leaves without her. She must remain until the US embassy issues a
replacement.
She decides to go sightseeing outside Rangoon with a charming guide, a
dissident academic, played by U Aung Ko, their car breaks down, and they
get cut off by the rioting which has broken out. He is wounded when the
soldiers open fire on them, and they are forced to flee for their lives
to the Thai border.
The film confronts two worlds -- the woman from a democracy with a
culture of violence and man from a country with a pacific Bhuddist
culture ruled by a violent military regime. But while Arquette is good,
she is not quite big enough  a star to carry a film single handed, and
the character is at times so wantonly silly that one loses sympathy with
her and the film's message gets lost in one's irritation. Instead of
being inspired by her rediscovery of the will to live, one feels like
knocking some sense into her thick head.
Malaysia stands in for Burma most effectively, and Boorman sustains
the tension during their flight to freedom, but the mixture of two
genres -- thriller and polemic -- does not work.
This week's blockbuster -- summer is upon us and they are coming out
of the woodwork -- is Congo, a ludicrous, but thoroughly enjoyable
adventure yarn set in the Congo -- where else? Based on a novel by
Michael Crichton, it involves a handsome explorer, a beautiful heroine,
a cuddly monkey, an effete villain, things that go bump in the night,
diamond mines and a lost city hidden in impenetrable jungle. But there
is a difference -- all the stereotype characters are nicely subverted.
The big white hunter hero (Ernie Hunter) is black, the white hero
(Dylan Walsh) is a wimp, who spends much of his time being adored by
Amy, the loveable lady gorilla -- the Cheetah figure -- while the
heroine (Laura Linney) is a resourceful new woman with more gimmicks in
her kit than James Bond, who does not scream at danger, but fires her
gun or delivers a karate chop.
The plot is about a search for King Solomon's mines where a mad
communications tycoon, Joe Don Baker, hopes to find a pure diamond to
operate his latest space satellite.
He sends his communications ace (Linney) to find out why an expedition
led by his son has disappeared after finding the diamonds. She joins an
expedition led by a young animal expert, Walsh, who is returning his
gorilla, Amy, which he has trained to speak with the aid of an unlikely
machine, to the wild from whence she came, and a Hungarian adventurer,
Tim Curry, who thinks Amy knows where the lost city is.
The only cliche missing is that immortal line, ''The Gods are
restless'', a native tribesman always utters when the local volcano
threatens to erupt, although we do get the equally classic remark, as
the ground trembles and the plaster rocks fall -- ''It will blow any
minute''. We know, of course, that it will do nothing of the kind. The
volcano always waits for the final reel.
The lost city, guarded by specially trained killer gorillas, is
magnificent -- the designer, J  Michael Riva, Marlene Dietrich's
grandson, is to be congratulated -- and the special effects when the
volcano erupts, the earth moves, and the lava flows, are stunning. It is
the best boys' own adventure of its kind since Indiana Jones hung up his
bullwhip, which is only to be expected as the director, Frank Marshall,
produced all three Indiana Jones films.

THE problem with really good dancers is they make it look so easy and
Rambert currently rejoice in a fine collection of really good dancers.
They make the human reef-knots and other intricate, athletic tangles of
Kylian's Petite Mort look unnervingly easy. They slippy-slide in and out
of nifty cats' cradles -- on occasion involving a her, a him, and a
fencing foil -- with such deadpan poise you just have to grin.
But then, this piece of cunning humour has been in their repertoire a
few months now. The alacrity, the clean, precise energy, the fine
timing, all carry through, however, into the new work: three pieces with
vastly differing dynamics that point up the stamina and flexibility of
the company as a whole.
Matthew Hawkins's Dancing Attendance on the Cultural Chasm (premiered
last night) is a sly, provoking melting-pot of styles that juxtaposes
classical with club and drops in frissons of much else besides. Set to
Rameau's Les Indes Galantes, it at times seems like an intriguing battle
between nobility and primitivism, perhaps a reflection on various
battles within the dance world between contemporary and ballet camps.
Dressed in exotic bodyskins -- transparent but with strategic lacy
panels -- the dancers create scenarios that at times evoke the courtly
dances of renaissance masques, or else those romantic encounters full of
sylphs and swans so beloved of nineteenth-century balletomanes. It's a
pity that some of the most interesting looking dance -- and Hawkins has
a real flair for combining details of different styles -- is somewhat
obliterated by the heavy pattern on the veil that descends midway
through . . . not so much a chasm as a barrier.
Following on from the driven, impassioned plaints of Per Jonsson's
Jupiter Is Crying came Bruce's own witty, humane, and utterly engaging
Meeting Point, made for the recent celebration of the United Nations
50th anniversary. Ways of coming to terms -- all the trickery of
confrontation and bluff -- were ordered into a fresh, sassy piece of
dance that explored not just the tensions and reconciliations between
the suits who govern countries, but also the participants in the war of
the sexes.

IF the influence of the Jesus and Mary Chain has been extensive in
their 10-year history, then Drugstore are an appropriate support act,
inheriting many of the influences and mannerisms of the formative Mary
Chain.
Asides from a shared love of the Velvet Underground, this manifests
itself in an uneven and at points chaotic set. Fresh from a successful
Glastonbury appearance, it was reasonable to expect a band at their
peak, this show coming on the back of constant and productive touring.
If it looked promising early on, when they incorporated Starcrossed
and Devil from their awesome debut album, then it began to fall apart on
their cover of the Flaming Lips Vaseline, careering downhill into an
indulgent solitary party groover.
By contrast, the headliners exhibited many of the qualities Drugstore
lacked. Picking on what, by their own standards, was a crowd-pleasing
selection from all stages of their career, the one-hour, song-packed set
did much to display the sheer quantity of good songs written by the Reid
brothers across their five albums.
Singles like Sidewalking, Happy When It Rains and the more recent Come
On were the high points, and if the idea of a sing-along, clap-along
Mary Chain gig seemed improbable in 1985, then powered by excellent
playing and having been honed in US arenas, it is happening in 1995.
Not that they have changed all that much; the lyrics remain ensconced
in druggy, rock 'n' roll cliche, making the encore of their recent
single I Hate Rock 'n' Roll even more resonant.
They may claim that ''rock 'n' roll hates me'' but without one the
other could not exist. Without the bland mediocrities they serve as an
antidote to, the Jesus and Mary Chain would have lost their relevance
some time ago.

IVORY &amp; Sime's Optimum Income Trust has raised its dividend for the
year to end-May by 7.9% to 8.20p, with a fourth-quarter payout of 2.15p,
writes IAN McCONNELL.
The income-orientated trust, which reported yesterday, achieved a 9%
rise in net asset value to 98.21p during the 12 months, compared with an
11.7% increase in its benchmark FTSE-100 index.
Optimum Income, which aims to provide shareholders with a high and
growing level of income through investment in UK blue chips, has
increased its dividend by 34.4% since its launch in 1989.
Unlike some of its peers, it was not forced to cut its payout during
the early 1990s.
During the same period, the retail price index has risen by 18.5%.
Gordon Neilly, a director of Edinburgh-based fund management group
Ivory &amp; Sime, expects the trust's ''good dividend progress'' to
continue.
The #63m fund is due to be wound up in March 1997 but it is
anticipated that proposals for the continuation of the trust will be put
to shareholders before then.
Optimum Income's largest individual holdings are in Lloyds Bank,
petroleum giant Shell, British Gas and British Telecom, which each
account for between 4% and 5% of the portfolio.

ITALY'S biggest bank, San Paolo di Torino, is the latest to join the
IBOS cross-border instantaneous money transfer system which has been
developed by the Royal Bank of Scotland and its Spanish partner Banco
Santander.
San Paolo di Torino has about 1100 branches, roughly twice as many as
the Royal, and ranks 59th in the world by asset base.
By joining IBOS, it adds another piece to the international presence
and strategy of having one major bank in each country and brings the
total to nine.
It is thought that another European bank will join next month with the
priority to establish a network throughout the EU.

CAPTAIN'S LOG . . . Stardate 2095.6: These are the voyages of the
Toryship Enterprise, our mission to boldly go to the depths of the
opinion polls where no party has ever been before. Star Trek Command
informed us last week that the Prime Minister of the Britannicus
territory was being threatened by an alien force, namely a coven of
British-based Vulgars, led by Greengrass John, late of the valley Wales,
where not even Lloyd George admitted to knowing his father.
The PM Major John has resigned. This is so he can be re-elected. No, I
know this does not seem logical to you, Spock, but these Britannicans
are not noted for their ability to follow a straight course from planet
to planet and insist on driving their spaceships round the left-hand
side of the moon.
Our mission is to go, observe, and ultimately destroy the forces of
darkness and keep the good old Major John on course for the final battle
with Nintendo Blairboy, a political chameleon who bounces from policy to
no policy. It would be a disaster for everybody if Blairboy won.
Beam me down, Mr Scott, and come with me -- this is not the sort of
mission on which we can trust anyone we meet.
SCENE: WESTMINSTER, LONDON BRITANNICUS.
Greengrass John: And so I say to you, hand on where most of you have
hearts, that despite the fact that I was a member of the Major Cabinet,
nothwithstanding that I pledged my support for him three times last
week, never mind that I went along with all the decisions of the
Government without protest, I must announce my candidacy for his job. We
will win.
Vulgar Throng: We will.
Captain K: I tell you, Mr Scott, I have seen nothing more frightening
than this since we encountered the tribe of Millwallian Socceranimus
Supportereen on the planet Earth some time ago.
Mr Scott: Actually, Captain, these are some of the same people.
Captain K: You mean you know about some of them?
Mr Scott: Yes, I read all about them in The Moon newspaper. ''Vulgars
tell Major to Hugh Grant'' was the headline, though I didn't understand
it myself. The fat guy in the blazer, that's Claus von Marlow; next to
him is Mother Theresa Gorman; and there's Peerie Norrie -- he used to be
a big Government figure, now he is just a big figure.
Greengrass John: My Government will cut taxes, abolish crime, hang
murderers, pay doctors and nurses more, and make everybody happy.
Mediaperson: How are you going to do all that, then?
Greengrass John: Don't you try any of your trick questions, here,
laddie. We have ways of dealing with the left-wing bias of the media. In
the new Britain there will be no place for whingers, no support for
scroungers, no immigration, no . . .
Minder: Well, I am sure that covers all the points you wished to
raise. Our leader will be off now, avoiding constituency chairmen,
turning down in-depth television interviews, polishing his soundbites,
the usual stuff. See you again tomorrow when we will reveal how Major
John never had a dog.
Captain K: We have a serious task on our hands here Mr Scott.
Mr Scott: There's more. Major is not only opposed by the Vulgars,
there are also the Klingons to consider. They are led by Mr Kortillo and
hate everyone on the constellation of Europa even more than the Vulgars.
Captain K: Just a minute, Mr Kortillo says he supports Major John.
Mr Scott: That's the problem. Actually Mr Kortillo hopes Greengrass
will wound Major and the Klingons will then attack the Vulgars and
become the leader of all Britannicus.
Captain K: Will that happen? Mr Scott: Not if Tarzanius and his gang
have their way. If Major John falls they will swing down from the trees,
batter the Vulgars and the Klingons, and ride off in search of Blairboy.
Captain K: Does Major John have any real friends?
Mr Scott: Yes, there is Languid Ian, a loyal Scot, Forsyth of Stirling
-- one wonders why -- Malcolm of Rifkind, and most of the rest of the
Cabinet. But remember, this is a secret ballot.
Captain K: Are these tribal wars ever going to end?
Mr Scott: Well, probably not, until civilised democracy returns to
this part of the planet. Blairboy has a whole army of Dissenters
Leftuses just waiting to spring at him.
Captain K: Never mind the future, what can we do to help now?
Mr Scott: I have a plan, captain. Did you notice a wee fellow standing
at the back of the Vulgars; well, I know him, he comes from where I did
originally.
Captain K: You don't mean Sir Taylor Teddius. I heard him on the box
they call television and he said, quite honestly -- eight times -- that
he did not know what to do.
Mr Scott: Nothing new there, Sir. No, no, this man is much dafter than
Teddius. I cannot reveal his identity -- it is only supplied to electors
on a need-to-know basis -- but his codename is Biggles. If we were to
supply him with the firepower, a small airship with full firepower to be
used on party leader election day, plus a written guarantee, he could
become Lord Protector of the Scottish estates, or Cock o' the North or
some such title, he could be our man. Perhaps Mr Sulu could steer a
course for him, we don't want him wiping out the whole of Somerset.
Captain K: Has it really come to this? Has one of the Earth planet's
oldest democracies, containing the Mother of Parliaments, degenerated
into a snakepit of backstabbing and personal abuse? Is there nobody who
believes in honesty and decency anymore?
Mr Scott: Major John tried that -- see where it got him!
Captain K: Biggles it is. Beam me up, Mr Scott.
* To be continued at the same time next week, and possibly the week
after that, and maybe . . .

MORTGAGE lending by the banks continues to decelerate, with net
lending showing a rise of #428m in May against #508m in April and #629m
in May last year.
New loan approvals were more encouraging, showing a 19% rise by number
to 26,605 and 22% by value. Although the average value of loan approvals
recovered from #49,900 in April to #51,200 in May this still showed a
year-on-year fall, as happened for the first time last month. In 1994
the banks accounted for 36% of net mortgage lending.
Tim Sweeney, director-general of the British Bankers' Association,
commented: ''There is still no sign of any real improvement in the
housing market. Both gross lending and new approvals were well up on
April's poor figures but both are still some way below the figures
achieved in May last year.''
Gross lending in May went up by nearly 8% to #1385m, but this was
inflated by remortgaging which is thought to represent a significant
part of the total.

Geneva, Wednesday -- After more than two years of bitter motor trade
talks, the United States and Japan reached agreement today, averting US
sanctions which threatened to spiral into all-out trade war.
''Today Japan has agreed that it will begin to truly open its auto and
auto parts market to Americans,'' President Bill Clinton said in
Washington. ''This agreement is specific. It is measurable. It will
achieve real, concrete results.''
Aware of the high domestic political stakes, both sides claimed
victory.
Mr Clinton said the agreement would lead to a major increase in sales
of US automobiles and spare parts to Japanese companies. Washington
would now drop its threat to impose sanctions against $5900m worth of
luxury Japanese automobiles, that were due to come into effect midnight
Washington time, he said.
Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said the accord excluded set
numerical targets to measure increasing US sales. These were demanded by
Washington and were resisted by Tokyo. Instead that aspect was dealt
with by private sector action.
Mr Hashimoto said Tokyo had withdrawn its complaint against the United
States before the World Trade Organisation -- the global trade policeman
in return for Washington dropping the sanctions threat.
''This successful agreement is a victory not just for the United
States and Japan, but also for the newly created WTO and its members
countries,'' said Mr Hashimoto. There had been fears that unilateral
American action would undermine the authority of the new international
body which is meant to help settle disputes.
Mr Hashimoto appeared smiling and relaxed at a joint news conference
with US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor after virtually non-stop
negotiations this week.
News of the breakthrough was sudden. It had been expected that the
talks would continue right to the deadline.
The accord averts a potentially devastating trade war between the
world's two top economies which would have undermined global business
confidence and soured political relations. There had been indications
that Japan would have retaliated against American products.
At the heart of the dispute was the US trade deficit with Japan, which
came to $66bn last year, more than half of that in the motor sector.
''This agreement helps to close the (trade) gap,'' said Mr Clinton.
''This commitment means thousands of new jobs for American workers. Jobs
for Americans making parts sold in Japan, jobs for Americans making
parts for Japanese cars sold in the United States,'' he said.
In a bid to ease fears of Europe and Australia in particular that they
would lose market share in Japan, Mr Hashimoto said benefits of the deal
would be extended to other trading partners.
He said Tokyo had achieved its goals because the deal between the two
governments excluded the US demands for targets for measuring increases
in sales of spare parts and in the numbers of dealerships.
The Japanese government had rejected the numerical targets and said it
could not force companies to buy American products. Action was up to
individual companies, it maintained.
As soon as the accord was reached, major motor manufacturers in Japan
announced ''voluntary'' plans to increase production and investment in
North America and use more American spare parts in vehicles assembled
there. This was one of Washington's key demands.
For instance, Toyota said it would raise its North American production
to 1.1 million units in 1998 from 900,000 units in 1996. It said it was
considering construction of a new North American plant.
Nissan said it would step up manufacture in North America of major car
parts and build a new assembly plant in Tennessee. Honda said it would
increase purchases of spare parts and boost investment in North America.
Mazda said it would boost exports from Auto-Alliance International, a
joint venture with Ford and buy more foreign parts. Mitsubishi Motors
said it would curb exports of parts and components from Japan abroad. --

LOADS of plus points about last night's Royal SNO Prom. First, a
damned good programme; classics all the way, a stream of great music,
with not an ounce of rubbish or ''music merely for feet''. Secondly, a
steamy tropical night, a well-filled house, and an audience bustling
with a ready response.
Thirdly, the house lights dimmed, music stands lit, and some
atmospheric changes of colour on the platform -- for those who do not
regularly attend classical concerts, the convention is bald house lights
all night. This was extremely effective, especially when the lights
closed down on the horns in the introduction to Coppelia (and horn
players, as everyone knows, do it better in the dark).
A lot of the music, conducted by Christopher Seaman, just couldn't
miss the target: at one extreme, the pounding Death of Tybalt from
Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet; at another the soft calm of flautist John
Grant's playing in Faure's Pavane, or the seductive hush of the Berceuse
from Stravinsky's Firebird (brilliant woodwind playing) and the
subsequent, magical Finale.
But, you know something? I wish conductor Christopher Seaman would get
angry once in a while. He is an extremely nice guy, and -- as you would
have been able to tell from his introductions to the pieces -- a perfect
gentleman. But in a lot of this music he was just too downright polite.
The pizzicato from Sylvia needed more plucking panache, those infernal
ducks in Swan Lake were so stodgy they must have been on beta-blockers,
while the waltzers were as stiff as a board and the Ritual Fire Dance
was fuelled by damp kindling. Oh, for a whiff of danger.

MURRAY Split Capital Trust suffered a 1.5% fall in net assets during
the nine months to May after a lacklustre performance by the utilities
and medium-sized companies in its portfolio.
''Good performances by the trust's investments in banks, insurance,
pharmaceuticals and food were not sufficient to offset the two weaker
areas,'' the trust managers Murray Johnstone said.
Net assets fell to #25.2m from #26.5m, contrasting with a 0.4% rise in
the FTSE All-Share Index over the nine-month period.
The net asset value of zero dividend preference shares rose 8.4%,
while that of income shares edged up 0.8%, but the nav of capital shares
slumped 9.5%.
The trust held its quarterly dividend unchanged at 2.65p.
Murray Johnstone said uncertainty over interest rates was likely to
limit equity gains over the Summer, but the longer term prospects were
more encouraging.
''The autumn season should see further progress in corporate earnings
and combined with strong dividend growth provides a positive background
for equities,'' the Glasgow-based fund manager said.
The Murray Split Capital Trust's main investments at the end of May
were in British Telecom, Shell Transport and Trading, Glaxo Wellcome,
and British Petroleum.
Each of these companies accounted for between 3% and 4% of its overall
portfolio.

WITH her husband's jaiket on a shoogly nail, it may not be the best
time for Norma Major to concentrate on her latest literary project. But
unless she gets a move on, her book on Chequers, the prime ministerial
country residence, may be written from the point of view of a former
tenant.
Mrs Major has spent two years researching the book. Her original
publisher, Little Brown, changed their minds and pulled out of the
project.
The idea has now been taken up by Harper Collins and the book is to be
published next spring -- stalking horses and leadership elections
notwithstanding.
* John Major features in an exhibition called Sporting Prints at the
Glasgow Print Studio. A screenprint by David Mach, the artist better
known for building giant structures out of tyres, depicts the Prime
Minister (until Tuesday at least) on the receiving end of a punch. It
could be an omen.
Dramatic irony
WITH impeccable timing, Premiere, the American movie magazine, has a
certain British actor on its front cover with the headline ''The
indiscreet charm of Hugh Grant''.
* By another sheer coincidence, Mr Grant tops the list of new entries
in the International Who's Who 1995-96. Editor Richard Fitzwilliams
tells us that Mr Grant has chosen not to list his leisure interests.
You will no doubt be riveted to hear that his middle name is Mungo.
Editor Fitzwilliams adds that ''while Hugh Grant has secured entry to
the book, alas Liz Hurley will not yet be joining him between the
covers!''
Unusual hobbies listed by entrants include ''restoring Second World
War Jeeps'' by ex-King Michael of Romania, ''raising orphaned
marsupials'' by Australian writer and academic Luise Hercus, and
''collecting the wrappings encasing citrus fruits in greengrocers'
shops'' by German banker Hilmar Kopper.
Glasgow's own Booker prize-winning author, James Kelman, is included
for the first time but he too has not an effan word about his leisure
pursuits in his entry.
Sales talk
A NEW card shop at the corner of Queen Street and Argyle Street in
Glasgow has come up with a brilliant marketing concept -- a section of
cards with the heading ''Say it with words''.
Heads and hi-tech tails
DEPT of Really Useful Information: What illustration is to be found on
the reverse (or back side) of the Isle of Man #1 coin. It is not the
three-legged device, nor even the cat with no tail.
It is, in fact, a likeness of a mobile phone with a satellite in the
background. We asked the Manx coin people why. Is it because the Isle of
Man is full of rich people with big bank accounts who can afford mobile
phones?
No, they chose to celebrate technology and the mobile phone seemed
like a good idea. Their 50p piece has a computer on its erse. Or is erse
the language they speak on the Isle of Man? It's so easy to get
confused.
One-upmanship
A PIECE of Even More Useful Information. Dr Paolo Capanni of
Bishopbriggs writes to tell us of a drug called Caverject ''which is
given, by injection, by doctors to treat erectile dysfunction in men''.
Dr Capanni wants us to know that the aforementioned drug is manufactured
by a pharmaceutical company called Upjohn.
Parliamo Glesga
GEORGE GORMAN of East Kilbride continues our Auld Alliance theme with
some memories of the Free French troops who were billeted in Johnstone
during the Second World War. The soldiers had picked up most of their
English from the local factory girls.
Mr Gorman's father was on a bus coming home from work. One of the
passengers was a French officer sitting on the long seat at the back of
the bus.
He was dressed smartly in uniform and looked every inch the perfect
gentleman. Indeed, when a lady boarded the bus at a subsequent stop, the
Frenchman gallantly stood up and offered her his seat.
The overall effect was somewhat spoiled by the words with which he
accompanied his gesture. He stood up, clicked his heels, saluted, and
said with all the natural gallantry of his nation: ''Madame, plank your
arse down there!''

THE scene is the Bail Appeal Court in Edinburgh where advocate Alan
Muir is trying to persuade Lord ''Tiger'' Morrison that his client
should be freed pending trial. A major plank of the appeal is that Mr
Muir's client has a severe medical problem.
Give me details, says His Lordship. Actually he suffers from chronic
diarrhoea says Mr Muir. ''And I should point out that his application
for bail is wholeheartedly supported by his cell mates.''
Lord Morrison was amused and in an understanding mood. Bail granted.

DEPARTMENT of Some Mistake Surely: the weather reading in the Scottish

A DECISION on who will go through to the final phase of bidding for
the port of Dundee has been delayed until next week, writes ROBERT
POWELL.
At least three companies have submitted preliminary bids for the trust
port, which is expected to fetch anywhere between #12m and #20m.
These are Clydeport, Forth Ports and John Sutcliffe &amp; Son, the
operators of Boston port in Lincolnshire.
There may also be other contenders who have not yet made their
intentions public.
Bidders were expecting hear yesterday whether they had been cleared
for the second and final round of the bidding process.
But a spokesman for Dundee Port Authority said: ''Matters have not
been finally decided yet. The expectation is that short-listed bidders
will be advised that they are on the short list next week,'' he added.
James Sutcliffe, the chairman of John Sutcliffe &amp; Son, described the
delay as ''infuriating''. ''I don't know how to read it quite frankly,''
he said.
Once the preferred bidders have been chosen by the port's
privatisation committee they will have a further month to submit final
proposals.
The sale of Dundee port, which handles about one million tonnes of
cargo per year, should be finalised in the late summer or autumn.
Since Sutcliffe revealed its interest in Dundee at the weekend the
family-owned firm has been sounded out about Rosyth. But Mr Sutcliffe
said he was not interested in converting the quayside of the Firth of
Forth naval base into a commercial port for the time being.

Rob Adams speaks with talented jazz trombonist Annie Whitehead about
the new band she is bringing to Glasgow.
VARIETY for Annie Whitehead is not just the spice of life -- it's the
main ingredient. ''It's important for me to do lots of different things,
to keep stretching,'' she says. ''Because I get frustrated having to be
in one little box. The idea that I can't play on a rock band's record
because I also play with a serious jazz band seems to me absurd, but you
still meet people who think that way.''
Since she moved down to London from Oldham in 1981, Whitehead has been
taking her trombone into an ever-widening sphere of music. Her diary
this year includes dates with the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, jazz trumpeter
Harry Beckett, and rock band Blur, as well as umpteen recording sessions
with bands whose identities half the time she doesn't even know --
because the session musicians have played their parts, packed up and
gone on to the next job before the ''stars'' arrive.
The band Whitehead brings to McEwan's Old Fruitmarket tomorrow
reflects the breadth of experience she has gained in 25 years of
professional music making. I'm not sure if you can hear traces of her
time with Ivy Benson's peripatetic finishing school for young women
musicians, but the influences of South Africans Dudu Pukwana and Chris
MacGregor, Brazilian Hermeto Pascoal, British free improvisation doyen
John Stevens, and reggae-flavoured Fun Boy Three all surface on the
cassette which arrived prior to our chat.
The band, called appropriately the Annie Whitehead Experience, was not
her own idea but was suggested by London jazz animateur Debbie
Dickinson. ''I'm not really interested in forming bands just for the
sake of having your own band,'' says Whitehead. ''And I thought long and
hard about whether I wanted to have my own band and who I should have in
it.
''I knew I wanted to play my own stuff, which is very eclectic, and I
needed to choose musicians who could respond to that without being
directed all the time, musicians who could be free -- not that we play
free music as such -- and that I could just talk to about a concept. For
instance, when I had the idea about the tribute to Dudu Pukwana
everybody knew the emotions that I had in mind, and the piece happened
very naturally.''
She chose Dutch keyboard master Jasper Van t'Hof (who has certainly
been underexposed in the UK and in whose African-styled band Piri Piri
Whitehead also plays), guitarist Ian Maidman, bass guitarist Dudley
Phillips, and drummer Liam Genockey who, if you're looking for
eclecticism, is your man. From Gerry Rafferty's soft rock to Trevor
Watts's free jazz, Genockey has provided an expert touch in all manner
of musical situations.
Having the trombone as the only front line instrument, though unusual,
was intentional. ''I liked the idea of being able to play unison lines
with the guitar and to add little impromptu figures behind other
people's solos,'' says Whitehead. ''When you play in a horn section it's
usually all arranged and you can't just decide to come in anywhere you
like.''
While the Experience supplies enough dance floor-friendly grooves and
funky rhythms to satisfy the average party animal, there's a reflective
side to the music, too. ''I really like playing quietly,'' says
Whitehead. ''I like the sound of the trombone played loud. But playing
quietly gives you a lot more fluency, allows you to express more
emotion.
''For a long time I was scared of expressing my gentler side and I
kind of assumed that because I'm a woman people would expect me to play
pretty and ladylike. So I deliberately developed a brash, loud tone and
played really bolshie-like so that I wouldn't be accused of being a
wimpy, feminine trombone player. But now I've proved that I can play, I
just play the way I feel.''

SHELL's volte-face over the sinking of the Brent Spar oil storage
platform last week in the face of international criticism was a useful
reminder, to those companies that need it, that they do not operate in a
vacuum. In the past businesses just got on with the task of creating
wealth but these days they also need to keep on the right side of public
opinion.
Shell, Europe's biggest oil company, and the privatised utilities,
have paid a heavy public relations price for insensitivity in their
business activities. It is not that everyone necessarily disagrees with
the company's actions, but it is more a case of disapproval of the
arrogant and insensitive manner in which various proposals have been put
forward.
It is not the first time Shell has attracted controversy in its
business dealings. The company's headquarters in London have been
picketed by protesters concerned about the environmental damage they say
has been caused by Shell's exploration on lands owned by the Ogoni
people of Nigeria. The issue was covered in a Channel Four film, The
Drilling Fields, broadcast last year. For many years Shell was the
subject of a consumer boycott because of its continued trading in South
Africa during the years of apartheid.
Well-run companies know these days they need carefully to balance the
interests of all stake holders in their business: staff, shareholders,
customers, and the general public.
Large public relations teams are employed by most major companies --
certainly those listed in the FTSE-100 index. One of their jobs is to
try to pre-empt just the kind of bad publicity which has engulfed Shell
in the past week. Trading conditions are highly competitive in almost
all business sectors, and so few companies can afford to alienate a
section of the community and precipitate a consumer boycott.
Many major companies have extensive community activity programmes. For
example Kingfisher, whose retail outlets include B &amp; Q, Woolworth's and
Comet, has programmes covering a number of areas: equal opportunities,
homelessness, community safety and crime prevention, education, and the
environment. In Actions Speak Louder, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chief
executive of Kingfisher, outlines how the company's approach to social
responsibility has evolved from just giving charitable donations into a
wider investment of time and effort into the community.
Sir Geoffrey quite rightly says it is not enough to have a portfolio
of worthy activities. A practical commitment to improving certain
aspects of society must also be demonstrated. He believes the multiple
benefits of involvement in social responsibility provide the basis for
significant competitive advantage. Indeed, such responsible companies
are likely to be better able to attract and retain staff, and their
products and services will be sought out by a growing section of the
community.
The issue of companies being responsible in their trading activities
has been highlighted by the success of Anita Roddick's Body Shop. The
group grew rapidly in the 1980s as consumers became more concerned about
''green'' issues. While the company would be the first to admit that it
is not perfect, it does pride itself on trying to be a socially
responsible company. Ms Roddick says: ''Values are a part of the Body
Shop's genetic code''.
The company has long had a campaigning role for fair trade and
developing relationships with communities in need across the world. It
was one of the first to carry out an environmental audit of all aspects
of its business in line with the European Eco-audit regulation of March
1992.
In addition it has set up a Values and Vision Centre, linking its
Against Animal Testing, Environmental, Fair Trade, and Human Rights
departments. The group's high profile stand against animal testing has
prompted other mainstream cosmetic retailers such as Boots and Sainsbury
to launch their own range of products not tested on animals.
While the Body Shop is not an example that all companies could or
should follow, it is a clear illustration that it is perfectly possible
for companies to make money while being sensitive to the needs and
concerns of the world at large. Increasingly, the most successful
companies will be those that integrate environmental concerns into every
aspect of their operations.
By contrast, those that employ outmoded attitudes and practices which
treat the environment as a free resource can expect declining market
share and increasing costs as ''green'' or ''eco'' taxes are imposed to
make polluters pay.
* Actions Speak Louder, A Management Guide to Corporate Social
Responsibility by David Clutterbuck with Dez Dearlove and Deborah Snow
is published by Kogan Page in association with Kingfisher. Price #10.95.

''IF he had told more interesting stories I would have loved him
more,'' says the overall-clad, bespectacled Chinese documentary maker,
Wu Wenguang reflecting on his civil servant of a dad and perhaps
speaking for children the world over. If only one's parents were as
interesting as we wished them to be.
It is just such personal connections that gives this strangely moving
presentation from three of China's most alternative -- read bravest --
artists such an universal appeal. Highlighting the human in the midst of
impersonal and bureaucratic uniformity is not exclusive to China though
perhaps more extreme.
And certainly it lies at the heart of File O -- a mixture of words,
video, and performance art (welding taking place in real time on stage)
in which director Mou Sen juxtaposes textures, sounds, and images to
underline the violent contrast between state impersonality and the
fragile fecundity of the human and individual: words describing the
education of a child set against the video of a child having open-heart
surgery; words describing the room of files in which thousands are
catalogued and categorised against the very personal account of Wu
Wenguang talking about himself and his father and later, another
performer, Jiang Yue, reading an account of an intense but doomed love
affair.
Inspired by a poem, File O by Chinese poet Yu Jian, maybe there is
something naive in its simplicity, in the sudden billowing of a white
sheet in the air, in the dashing of apples into a thousand pieces
against a giant fan. But equally there is not a hint of sensationalism
in all this -- just a cool, questioning sense of inquiry which proves
absolutely devastating.

YESTERDAY one of our readers wrote to ask if the world really needed
critics. This is a very good question, as anyone who has ever been
forced to spend an evening with a critic will know. Hitchcock said
actors should be treated like cattle; sensible people might argue that
critics should be treated for mange. As Dorothy Parker noted, they are
writers for the ages -- generally the ages four to eight.
What galls most people about critics, perhaps, is the perceived
unfairness of the relationship. When the comedian Stephen Fry deserted
the country (and his career) actor friends defended him much as any old
queen is defended: don't harass him, he can't answer back. Critics were
likened to muggers, terrorists, hit-and-run drivers and anyone else,
from Attila the Hun to the editor of the Sun, disinclined to accept
responsibility with their power.
The point is, however, that everyone is a critic, not least those who
write to the press to ask why the world needs critics. Just about
everyone is hitting back at their critics just about all the time. The
man who thinks a sink is where used crockery goes to die will long since
have learned how to handle his partner's cavilling, much as a Cabinet
Minister learns the body swerves required when dealing with Jeremy
Paxman.
John Major has, for example, been answering his critics lately. The
foppish star of the hit British comedy Four Bastards and a Leadership
Campaign is fighting to save the career that has given us all so much
entertainment. Having admitted to indulging in ''lewd behaviour'' with
the entire Conservative Party, he hopes now to ''silence his critics''.
That is his right, poor clown.
But rather than ask who is entitled to call himself a critic, it is
better to ask who isn't. All columnists are critics, for example, even
those whose relationship with the planet is a mere accident of gravity.
The only difference between them and the man in the pub who has also
heard the story about the three Cabinet Ministers is that columnists are
paid, after a fashion, to mouth off.
Yesterday our correspondent -- criticising the critics, if you like --
argued that by ''panning'' a show reviewers are, in effect, ''preventing
theatres from being well-attended''. This would be a noble ambition, if
it were true, but since the theatres are all that stand between the
average reviewer and penurious madness, the accusation doesn't really
stand up.
What the writer really meant, I think, was to ask what, if anything,
we learn from criticism. A good reviewer thinks he can tell you in 600
words exactly what is wrong with a book that a novelist spent three
years writing.
Someone who couldn't put two coats of emulsion on the kitchen will
tell you exactly where an artist has gone astray. A writer who couldn't
get the kids in shot for the holiday video will explain why Orson Welles
is over-rated.
Is any of this useful? This columnist writes as one who has seen both
edges of the sword.
Having spent years merrily slashing and burning (and sometimes
praising) it was his lot, a couple of years back, to be on the receiving
end. This was, as they say, a learning experience.
First of all you learn that even an experienced journalist, so called,
can be turned into a kid with a new toy by a few kind words from the New
Yorker. Then you learn that, contrary to all previous belief, the
Guardian is populated by scumbags while the Telegraph and the Times
actually contain some really nice, intelligent people. Neither praise
nor blame tells you anything you didn't already know. In other words,
you learn nothing about your work and something about yourself.
This isn't a new phenomenon, even if some people persist in pretending
they never read their notices. Richard Nixon, for example, revealed
everything about himself by his reaction to criticism: everyone was an
enemy and all had to be destroyed. Similarly, Tony Blair's press aides
are fast acquiring a reputation for the sort of paranoia that did for
Harold Wilson.
Why? It's not that these people mind being written about, quite the
contrary. They exist only to be written about; they couldn't survive
without it. It's not journalism actors or politicians object to -- just
nasty journalists who write nasty things. Tempers really become frayed
when the nasty things happen to be true.
That's the nub of it: accurate criticism hurts. The claim that
journalists have no ''right'' to make adverse comments meanwhile gets
its answer in the splendours of the market economy. No-one is being
forced to read commentary or reviews -- though the idea might be worth
considering if the Government intends to strengthen penal policy.
Criticism is, or should be, public argument. If this writer tells you
of a Saturday morning that your favourite TV show is as intellectually
testing as a conversation with Sooty and slightly less believable, he
means only to pursue an argument about what makes good television, not
to finger you as the credulous dope you probably are.
All critics serve the same primary function. Would this play, book or
album be a waste of your money or an experience beyond price? Is this or
that political event good for the country or bad? Broadly speaking, it
is not the critic's mission in life to drive pantomime dames to drink or
send MPs to the funny farm.
All rules have exceptions, of course. One is that a columnist can
criticise anything except himself. The raving bigot who spares no effort
to condemn, the witch-finder general making it up as he goes along, also
admits to no fault. This is convenient for him and unpleasant for his
readers.
Naturally, The Herald has never employed such.

THE soaring German mark has dealt a major blow to the flagship of
German industry with Daimler Benz saying that it is transferring both
production and component buying abroad.
It is forecasting a ''severe loss'' for 1995 and will be making
reorganisation charges totalling more than DM1000m (#460m).
The news shocked stock exchanges in both Frankfurt and London and the
shares plunged 7% to DM639, wiping the equivalent of #1125m off the
market capitalisation to #15bn.
That was despite the company saying its management board expected
there was a high probability that 1996 group results ''would again be
clearly positive''.
Analysts are now forecasting losses of about DM12 per share compared
with earlier expectations of earnings of about DM18.
Making the best of a bad job, Daimler said the changes in global
competition and higher risks triggered by the foreign exchange rate
moves would provide a good opportunity for a critical review of its
stake holdings and to continue its streamlining of its portfolio.
Significantly it no longer saw the strength of the mark (against the
dollar) as temporary.
The Mercedes-Benz car division has performed well even if overall
sales in the first five months of 1995 have fallen 7.2% to 178,249 units
although the UK market has been particularly good, rising 8.5% to 14,474
cars, with sales in May alone accelerating by 11.4%.
Commercial vehicle registrations have also been strong in Britain.
The bulk of the damage appears to have been incurred in the DASA
aerospace division where prices are dollar based but costs are in marks.
Since the beginning of January, the currency has appreciated 11% against
the dollar and 10% against sterling which has given competitors such as
Boeing and British Aerospace a huge cost advantage.
The Daimler decision will almost certainly be repeated by other major
German companies which also have to bear hefty social security costs.
It seems likely that a substantial amount of work will be transferred
into eastern Europe and particularly the Czech Republic although
component manufacturers such as T&amp;N and Laird should see increased
business for their UK domiciled operations. However that will be offset
by a probable reduction in overall volume as concern grows that there
may be a significant slowdown in the German economy reappearing again.

TMU-Na -- Hebrew for moving pictures -- are back in London. The
Israeli company who made international waves with their 1993 production,
Real Time, have now been brought to BAC, Battersea Arts Centre, by its
new young chief, Tom Morris.
As an introduction to their work, Transit Hotel (seen at the Belfast
Festival last year) presents, however, a confusing, troubled picture.
Conceived on the back of a horrific incident 20 years ago, the
occupation of the Savoy Hotel in Tel Aviv by Palestinian guerrillas and
its subsequent storming by Israeli soldiers which left 15 -- hostages
and Palestinians -- dead, it's a theatrical experience that underlines
cultural differences with a vengeance.
Tmu Na's angst-riddled, emotionally melodramatic end-of-performance
drama whose equivalents here lie in the younger, Euro-crash physicality
of groups like Volcano or DV8 is an ocean away from the cooler ironic
emotionalism of Theatre de Complicite or even Forced Entertainment whose
painful nihilism their work in some respects also resembles.
But for director Nava Zukerman and her dedicated corps, ambiguity is
clearly an unknown word. The drama of that terrible night is painted in
almost entirely one-dimensional, if occasionally striking, images of
agony -- unfortunately in the English translation, often banal ones too.
Nor does ex-Woodentop Murray Gold's self-conscious acoustic soundtrack
help, though gradually the sight of these writhing, clutching, clinging
bodies does generate its own demonic sense of desperate sadness.
Sex as a tool of escape from fear, love as a place of doom and
betrayal -- at the heart of this raw, punctured storm is a portrait of
unbearable rootlessness. Allied here to a specific event, it seems to
stand for a whole emotional state within Israelis themselves.

CABLE &amp; Wireless will pump #825m of new capital over the next three
years into Vebacom, the joint telecoms venture with Veba Group, a German
conglomerate, which was first disclosed in January.
Vebacom will be 55% owned by Veba and 45% by C&amp;W and the money will go
toward developing activities in the German telecoms and mobile phone
markets. Cable &amp; Wireless will contribute #490m on completion of the
deal and the balance over the following three years.
The investment will give C&amp;W a stake in the fast-growing market which
will soon be liberalised with the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom next
year. Veba is also taking a half-share of Cable &amp; Wireless's existing
European telecom interests outside Germany and the UK and will chip in
#39m of new capital. C&amp;W will continue to manage this business.
Veba and C&amp;W intend to take a more unified approach to the development
of their telecoms activities in Europe. C&amp;W chairman Lord Young
indicated that the talks following the initial announcement in January
had gone well.
''We have achieved exactly what we set out to do. We are laying the
foundations for a formidable partnership with enormous potential in the
telecoms markets of Germany and the European Union, which are among the
world's largest,'' he said.
Vebacom will start with a number of telecom interests, including a 28%
stake in E-Plus, one of Germnay's mobile phone networks. Many other
telecom groups looking at the German market, with BT having made an
alliance with Viag, and competition will be fierce.
Cable &amp; Wireless has 5% of another German mobile network, Mannesmann
Mobilfunk, and it will sell this stake to avoid conflicts of interest.
Analysts reckon this could bring in #250m-#300m, reducing the cost of
the Vebacom investment. This cost will push gearing up to 46% but C&amp;W
says it will then reduce as a result of the group's strong cashflow.

THE fingers of Miles Davis were loosened by decades of trumpet playing
before they ever picked up a paint brush. But the rhythms remained and
flowed on to canvas between 1980 and his death in 1991.
To coincide with Glasgow's Jazz Festival the Art Exposure Gallery in
Parnie Street will from tomorrow exclusively display a selection of the
musician's sketches and paintings, as seen above with gallery director
John Heuston.
Musical and African influences are found in swirls of pastels, pencils
and paint. The exhibition is shown in association with Jonathan Poole,
European agent for the Miles Davis estate.
It will also include the jazz-influenced drawings of Glasgow school of
art graduate Jeff McDonald.
Hueston describes Davis's paintings as ''free''. ''The way he plays
music is the way that he paints. There is a true freshness to them.''

EVERY day we are deluged with information on health matters from
newspapers and magazines to radio and television.Is it any wonder we end
up confused?
Should we starve a fever and feed a cold? Is honey better for you than
a sweetener? How much alcohol should you drink and what regular medical
checks should men and women carry out?
Well, one book that attempts to cover all these issues is the Reader's
Digest Good Health Fact Book. Its sub-title could be: 1001 Questions
You'd Most Like to Ask Your Doctor.
Yes, it certainly tackles subjects with gusto: from hypnosis to old
age, childbirth to infidelity. The question and answer format makes for
easy reading and reference (for instance the guide to good posture
presented on the left).
My complaint -- a minor one -- is that it's too easy, too facile,
covering everything but nothing in depth.
Still, it's a useful reference book, and at least opens up discussion
on a wealth of issues which affect our everyday lives.
For example, on friendship, love and marriage: Why Friends Matter.
Question: ''I've always enjoyed being by myself. Is a large number of
friends a necessary component of mental health?''
Answer: ''People do need people. The true loner, the hermit who
habitually prefers only his own company to that of others, is a rare
individual.
''A solid network of friends and family can help you deal with stress
and make it less likely that you will suffer depression, anxiety or
other mental health problems.
''A rewarding social life has also been found to increase longevity
and lower the risk of developing cancer, heart disease and other major
illnesses.
''On scales of psychological satisfaction, friendships generally rank
lower than stable marriages as a source of happiness, but higher than
work or leisure pursuits.
''Friendships are usually strongest in childhood, from adolescence
until marriage, and again in old age, when retirement and bereavement
can decrease other social attachments. Psychologists believe that the
reason women usually adjust better than men after divorce or the death
of a spouse is largely the result of their broader social networks.
''Exactly how friendship influences mental and physical health is not
completely clear. One theory is that friends act as a buffers,
protecting one another from stress and nurturing one another's
self-esteem.''
* Reader's Digest Good Health Book, price #24.95
Head and neck
* KEEP your head upright with weight centred at the top of the spinal
column. Don't strain or tense your neck muscles.
Upper body
* HOLD your shoulders well back to open up the chest and rib cage.
Don't tense your shoulder muscles or throw your chest forward
unnaturally. Try to lift gently up with your thighs.
Pelvic region
* GENTLY pull your stomach muscles in and tilt forward. Don't hold
your breath or make a forced effort to suck in the abdomen. The stance
should feel natural and relaxed.
Legs
* KEEP your legs straight when standing, but don't lock your knee
joints. Bending your knees slightly helps you tilt your pelvis forward
and makes it easier to pull in the stomach muscles.
Feet
* DISTRIBUTE your weight evenly on both feet, adjusting your balance
so that you have slightly more weight over the ball of the foot and the
toes than over your heel.

ENGLAND'S Fiona Greaves struggled to beat young compatriot Tracey
Shenton yesterday in the first round of the Women's World championship
in Hong Kong.
Seventh seed Greaves admitted she played the wrong game against the
promising 18-year-old and she had to rely on experience to pull her
through 9-6, 4-9, 9-6, 8-10, 9-6.
''That's the first time I have played her and I really did not know
what to expect,'' said Greaves. ''I played the short game too much,
which was the wrong game to play against her.''
Shenton said that the match had given her confidence ahead of next
week's World Junior championship in Sydney.
Second seed Suzanne Horner of England reached the second round with a
9-7, 9-2, 9-3 win over Scotland's Senga Macfie, while No.4 seed Sarah
FitzGerald of Australia stormed past England's Donia Leaves 9-1, 9-2,
9-2.
Robyn Cooper put one over her coach, Sharon Bradey, with a 9-3, 9-5,
9-5 win and in-form Liz Irving of Australia took just 17 minutes to make
her presence felt with a comfortable 9-3, 9-0, 9-3 win against American
qualifier Amy Milanek.
Irving plays Sabine Schoene of Germany in the second round after the
ninth seed carved out a 9-6, 10-8, 10-8 victory over Leilani Marsh of
New Zealand.

<HEADLINE>Board clears the decks for new Trafalgar House bid. Northern Electric boosts dividend</HEADLINE>

NORTHERN Electric rewarded its loyal shareholders with a 33% rise in
the annual dividend to 33p after proposing a final shareholders' payment
of 23.4p. This is the largest dividend increase so far of the regional
electricity companies with just two more still to report their annual
results.
Last year, Northern increased its pre-tax profit by 21% to #155.8m
before exceptional charges. Earnings per share before exceptional items
grew by 26% to 100.6p.
The business was restructured during the year with the loss of 600
jobs. Gearing at the year-end was around 25% compared with zero at the
end of 1993-94, boosted by the group's decision to use #101.6m to buy
back 10% of its shares. The board is seeking approval at this year's
annual general meeting to buy back a further 10% of the share capital.
The main event affecting the company last year was the hostile #1200m
bid by Trafalgar House which subsequently lapsed following the surprise
announcement of a regulatory review by Professor Stephen Littlechild of
OFFER. Bid defence costs were #15.1m with fees to Warburg's merchant
bank thought to be between #3m and #4.5m.
Northern has since replaced Warburg with Schroders as its financial
adviser and merchant bank. This follows a view from the Takeover Panel
that neither Warburg, Swiss bank nor the combined group SBC Warburg
should advise Northern in the event of a bid for the company by
Trafalgar House. SBC advised Trafalgar House and Warburg advised
Northern Electric during Trafalgar's controversial bid last December.
However, since then, SBC has acquired Warburg and the Takeover Panel
was concerned about the need for both companies to get independent
financial advice.
Earlier this month an attempt to force the board to allow Trafalgar
House to renew its takeover bid at not less than #9.50 a share was
heavily defeated. It is thought likely that Trafalgar will renew its bid
for Northern.
The Northern board has agreed that once the regulatory uncertainty is
removed Trafalgar House should, if it so wishes, be allowed to make a
new offer irrespective of whether or not the board would recommend the
offer.
Northern Electric's chairman, David Morris, does not believe that the
company's offer to shareholders of a #560m package during its bid
defence, sparked the regulatory review.
The package included a special dividend of #1.50 a share, a bonus
issue of Preference shares with an underwritten cash alternative worth
on issue at least #1 per share and the distribution to shareholders of
the benefit of the group's holding in the National Grid estimated at
about 257p, as well as increasing Ordinary dividends.
There is to be no special package for customers although the company
stressed that domestic bills were cut by 5% during the year and were now
14% lower in real terms than in 1991.
Mr Morris said that the defence did not reveal anything that was not
already in the public domain. He added that the strength of the balance
sheet was visible and that the group's costs were exactly in line with
what was forecast at the time of last August's regulatory review.
The timing of the announcement of the new review, during the flotation
of the Government's remaining 40% shareholding in the shares of the
power generation companies National Power and PowerGen, prompted a sharp
fall in their share price which particularly annoyed overseas investors.
Northern Electric's results were in line with City forecasts but the
shares lost 2p to 774p where they yield 5.3%. Along with the other RECs
the shares remain overshadowed by the uncertainty surrounding the
outcome of the regulatory review and the Tory pary leadership contest.
The City fears the stricter regulation of the utilities that would come
from an incoming Labour government.

MIDLANDS Electricity pleased the stock market with a
bigger-than-expected full-year dividend of 29.75p a share, an increase
of 28.2%. The final dividend is 20.45p.
The company's annual profits were in line with City expectations, up
11.6% to #218m before tax. This was before setting aside #40m to cover
the disposal of its Powerhouse electrical retail joint venture. It
increased its losses last year to #2.2m compared with #1.5m in 1993-94.

GLASGOW'S office market is being flooded with outdated, second-hand
space while there is a shortage of new development. This lack of new
supply will push prime city-centre rentals up to around #19 per sq ft in
the short term, according to a report on the city's office market from
surveyors Lambert Smith Hampton (LSH).
The possibility of a Labour Government within the next two years,
changes in local government, and the continuing absence of the
''feel-good factor'', combine to pose uncertainty for the property
industry over the next two years.
The report predicts that the shortage of city-centre supply will boost
demand for peripheral office park schemes. The good news for the city is
that George Square could become an important office location again.
Over the last six months only 362,278 sq ft of office space was let or
sold, compared with 493,032 sq ft in the same period in 1994.
''Traditionally, the first six months are an indication for the year and
we predict that take-up for this year will be down on 1994,'' says Lynn
Arnott of LSH.
Signs off the continuing downturn are also evident in the complete
lack of lettings in the Park Area of new or refurbished property
available on the market for first letting. ''Supply continues to be the
theme of the recession with an ever-increasing amount of second-hand
property flooding the market, coupled with a low supply of new property
in the city centre,'' she says.
There are a large number of out-of-town office developments now
seeking planning permission, with the inevitable result that companies
faced with greater choice outside of the city centre will relocate to
business park settings. ''The differential in rents is slight at the
present time, but city centre prime rents will rise steeply over the
next two years due to low supply. This will only be a blip in the rental
growth curve until the development cycle catches up with supply and
rents even out. Short term rents will return to their level of 1991/92
when they peaked at #19 per sq ft,'' she predicts.
Worries that a change in government could impose new restrictions or
costs on the property industry are contributing to the continuing low
level of activity. ''Even though the Labour Party has a new, friendlier,
face there are still fears over taxation policies which have not yet
been voiced -- as well as a predictable increase in public spending. In
the past the property industry has had to deal with some fairly onerous
legislation under Labour -- Development Land Tax, development control,
and such like.''
Reforming local government is creating further fears about job
security, departmental control, and relocation of principal functions.
''Local government has always been a principal occupier in the local
market. New administrative centres will have to be created in the new
single-tier authority areas but not until policy decisions have been
confirmed.''
New development in Glasgow city centre focuses around two distinct
areas, the Broomielaw and George Square. ''It is a two-horse race at
present with the winner redefining the business district within Glasgow.
Our money goes on George Square, as a number of properties are already
under redevelopment,'' says Lynn Arnott.

WORLD 100 metres record-holder Leroy Burrell will not compete for the
rest of the summer because of a swollen tendon in his left foot.
The American suffered the injury last summer and now wants to
concentrate on the 1996 Olympics.
He set his world record of 9.85 seconds a year ago in Switzerland, but
finished fifth in the recent US championships and so failed to qualify
for the World championships.

By Patricia Gibb, manager of quality and communications, UK Banking
Scotland.
IT must have happened to everyone. You're awaiting an important
delivery and it hasn't shown up. You talk to customer services and they
pass the buck to someone else.
After endless telephone calls you receive an assurance that your
parcel is on the way. Two weeks later it arrives with a part missing and
during it all, you haven't received even the hint of an apology.
Poor service has become such a common occurrence that we've almost
come to expect it. It's easy to be smug and think ''not in my company''
but on closer inspection, how does your customer service stand up? Many
businesses these days are moving away from a price-orientated service to
an increasingly customer- orientated service. The aim is to meet
individual customer needs by providing customised products and services
at minimum cost.
Whatever your business, your competitors can often match you on price.
This makes it more difficult to compete on terms of cost to the customer
or unique selling points. The way forward is to offer a level of service
which sets you apart from your competitors and develops a strong
relationship with your customers.
Holding on to your existing customers is as important as reaching new
ones. It costs five times as much to attract a new customer as it does
to keep an old one. If you reduce customer loss by only two per cent, it
will have the same impact on your profits as a 10% reduction in
overheads.
Your long-term customers are loyal to your company. They want to buy
from you, and if you can provide exceptional service they may even
favour you over companies with lower prices.
Providing exceptional service means always meeting, and if possible
exceeding, your customers' expectations. You should always be prepared
to bend the rules a little to accommodate unusual customer requirements,
and above all you should have the genuine desire to put your customers
and their needs first.
It's not enough, however, simply to adopt these attitudes yourself.
You must create a ''culture'' within your organisation which puts
customers first. If you and your management team consistently provide
excellent customer service, then the rest of your staff will be
encouraged to act in the same way.
Encourage your staff to come forward with ideas. Ask them what they
think and reward good customer service. Demonstrate that this is your
top priority and it will become the priority for everyone within your
organisation.
In order to put customers first, you must find out what they want,
identify your key clients and examine their needs. You can then focus
your energies on satisfying those needs.
You will find that you maximise the return on your investment in
customer care if you concentrate on these clients, and encourage the
rest of your staff to do the same.
If you really want to understand what your customers need from you,
you should make sure you have a close relationship. Meet them on a
regular basis -- visit them on their own ground. Once you know their
needs you have the advantage over your competitors. You may be able to
offer solutions to their problems, even identify opportunities for them
before they do so themselves. To find out what your customers think of
your service, you can carry out telephone and postal surveys. It is
easier, however, and less expensive simply to talk to your customers on
a regular basis. Talk to staff -- they will probably have more
day-to-day contact with clients and customer comments are always a good
source of fresh ideas.
The down side of customer service is complaints. No-one likes them,
and no- one wants to handle them. Handling complaints should be a
high-priority task, handled by staff who are confident, highly trained
and who have the power to put things right. If a complaint is handled
satisfactorily, the chances are that the customer will remain loyal.
Complaints are also another means of identifying and responding to
customer needs -- so don't get stressed out about complaint figures --
you should be concentrating your energies on who is complaining and why,
and doing your best to solve your problems.
It doesn't matter what size your business is, your people are your
single most important asset. To customers they represent business, they
deliver the service. Success built solely on price and product can be
difficult to sustain. Success built on customer care creates customer
loyalty -- and loyal customers always come back for more.
Don't cut corners. Training in customer service skills is as essential
as training in any other area. Your staff need to be equipped to handle
even the most difficult of customers, and if they have the necessary
training they and you will be confident that they can.
Encouraging your workforce to think for themselves will allow them to
take the initiative when dealing with customers. As your business
expands it will become more difficult to handle each customer
personally, so you must be prepared to delegate. Give your staff broad
guidelines, but allow them to get on with it. Your front-line staff are
those who come into direct contact with your customers, they must
understand the importance of customer service, and the best ways of
delivering it. Make sure that staff who do not always come into direct
contact with clients also understand the importance of customer service,
and of supporting those who provide it.
Customer care is a serious commitment. It means always putting your
customers' needs first, and constantly anticipating these needs.
Making your customers feel as important as they are gives you your
best advertisement for your company. Customer needs are always changing,
though it is important to listen to what they tell you. In the years to
come they will be the solid and loyal foundation for your success.
Hard as it sometimes is to believe, the customer really is always
right, and today exceptional customer care is the heart of almost every
service industry.

If growth is on your mind Sandy Paton, associate director of business
banking, UK Banking Scotland recommends an interview with your local
manager.
STARTING up your own business is never easy. It takes, time, effort
and money and by the time it's up and running you may simply want to sit
back and let it take care of itself. But this is possibly the best time
to consider expanding your business, while profits are high and the
market is strong.
Before you decide to expand there are many things you'll need to
consider: your new market, for example, and competition; cost in taking
on more staff; and perhaps moving to new premises.
The people who helped you get started can also help you to move on. By
now your business banking manager should know your business almost as
well as you do, and he or she will have had plenty of experience in
helping small businesses expand.
Talking through your ideas with your business banking manager gives
you a good ''sounding board''. He or she will give you good advice and
honest opinions on what you can realistically expect to achieve. Once
you've thrashed out the basics, it's time to sit down and work out the
next step.
When you have your ideas assembled, it's time to put them together to
form your most important weapon in the battle for expansion -- your
business plan. You can get help with this from your accountant or from
your local enterprise trust or business shop.
Your business plan should answer all the questions you'll be faced
with as you expand. It should contain cash flow and profit and loss
projections for at least the first three years, it should identify your
new market and your new competitors, show any new products and
demonstrate how all of this will affect your core business.
If you can, you should undertake some market research -- again your
accountant or local enterprise trust will provide advice on this. They
may also be able to point out any grants that are available to you.
At the end of the day what you should have is your plan -- it has to
reflect what you think is possible -- and it also has to convince the
people you're going to ask to back you that it's possible.
Once you've got that in place, you should be looking at the strengths
and weaknesses of your business. Carrying out a SWOT analysis --
checking the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to your
business -- should help you identify and address any problem areas while
helping you make the most of your advantages. A SWOT analysis will
identify all the pros and cons of expansion. For example the pros might
include a strong balance sheet and a good record of profitability.
You may have a large spread of customers, giving you a powerful
potential market. Perhaps your financial projections demonstrate your
potential for profit.
These strengths create your opportunities -- you can increase your
customer base, making it larger and broader than before, and the chance
for increased earnings is always an incentive to push forward.
It is important, however, also to bear in mind the ''cons'' -- the
weaknesses and threats which may stand in your way. Once these have been
identified you can take measures to prevent them -- or to turn them into
''pros''.
You may have to move to bigger premises as the result of expansion,
and you will have to consider the increased costs this will create. You
might also have to train new employees, which also means more costs as
well as a delay in reaching full productivity.
It may be that you are in need of training yourself, to teach you how
to handle your larger business.
There may be problems with entering new markets, particularly foreign
markets, where there is the risk of fluctuating exchange rates,
devaluing your investment. In an unknown market there is no way of
telling whether payments will be made on time, and there is always the
possibility that your new workforce will not be loyal to you.
Consultation with your accountant, local enterprise trust, or business
banking manager should help you identify these problems and devise the
best ways of dealing with them.
No matter how carefully you consider all the options there are still
going to be many ''what ifs'' to consider. Again consultation can help
you identify the ''what if'' and modify your business plan to
accommodate them.
Assuming that you've identified all your pros and cons and you've had
your business plan accepted by your backers -- including the bank --
it's vital that you keep your plan by you all the time. You should
regularly compare your actual results with your projected results so
that if you need to modify your plan you can do it quickly and easily.
Keep your bank informed at all times of any changes to the plan or to
the business. Don't expect smooth sailing -- expanding your business can
be as tricky as starting up in the first place. If your business banking
manager knows what's going on, he or she is then in a better position to
offer you help when you need it.
By constantly monitoring your plan you keep your finger on your
business's pulse. It's not easy, but if you are always on top of the
situation you substantially increase your chances of success.
When planning the basics your first step is to find your sources of
advice and assistance. Your business banking manager, for example, is
locally based and can easily make lending decisions for small to
medium-sized businesses. Your accountant will help you plan, and set up
all your tax and VAT requirements.
If training seems to be a problem, your local enterprise trust can
arrange to train you and your workforce, the trust may also be able to
point out any grants you are eligible for, to help with the costs of
expanding.
Another source of grant aid may be your local authority. This may also
be able to help you if you are planning to relocate your business.
There are many places and people you can turn to for help. By using
their advice and expertise you should be able to develop a realistic and
successful plan for expansion.

SCOTTISH football could be set for the biggest shake-up in its
122-year-old history following the setting up of the game's Independent
Review Commission yesterday.
The long-ago recommendations of the Chester Report, buried in the
football archives for more than 20 years, may have to be dusted off and
examined once more.
That almost forgotten policy document suggested that the game in
Scotland should be run by a single body instead of being administered by
both the Scottish Football Association and the Scottish Football League.
Over the years the authorities have dragged their heels on the Chester
Report, but now the same advice looks likely to be repeated from the
commission they themselves have set up.
The chairman of the new commission, former SFA secretary Ernie Walker,
admitted that administrative change would be something considered by his
think tank, and one of the foreign voices heard at Hampden yesterday --
that of Swedish FA general secretary Lars Christer Olsson -- suggested
that was, indeed, the way ahead for Scotland as we approach the next
century. Veteran Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the father of ''total
football'', is the other foreign influence on the Independent Review
Commission.
While Walker himself has insisted his support for the status quo as
recently as the end of last season, he admitted yesterday: ''We need
someone from outside our own game to look at the problems we face. It is
not enough to look at them ourselves.
''We are saying here that we want help, and we are recognising that we
need help, and that is important.''
He added: ''We have to look at the shape of the SFA, at its structure,
and we have to see if, after 122 years, changes have to be made and
whether some parts of the structure have to be pruned.''
Shortly afterwards Olsson appeared to suggest that pruning was in
order -- though he did so with reference to his own highly successful
nation.
The man who has been hailed as one of the most successful of the
game's administrators in Europe -- only recently in the Faroes, Scottish
supremo Jim Farry told me that the Swedes were a model for the rest of
Europe -- believes that small is beautiful and that small is also
manageable.
He stressed yesterday: ''We have only the one body governing the game
in Sweden. Some years ago we changed the structure and we have found it
to be successful for us.
''As we are nations of comparable size, I would imagine that our
system would work well for Scotland. We had a national association and a
league, just as you do, now we have just the association.
''Even then we have cut the numbers. There is maybe an executive of
around six people who run the game. Then we have areas around the
country where we can have discussions about what is to happen in the
game.
''There are always strong personalities in football and so we have
found that if we lessen the chances of conflict by bringing down the
number of people involved in decision-making, it works for the good of
the country.
''I will be looking at your set-up, because that is why I am on the
commission, and I will be making suggestions.''
Olsson, as well as his impeccable Swedish credentials, is also highly
rated in UEFA's corridors of power.
Even while his early views might be unpalatable to those who form the
League and SFA committees, they remain valid because of the success of
similar policies in Sweden.
They might mean, in the long run, a shortage of jobs for the boys, but
the football bosses have asked for advice, and questions will be asked
if advice which might be unwelcome to some is ignored.

Business growth is no longer of concern only to ambitious
entrepreneurs and financial backers -- it affects, directly or
indirectly, the financial well-every person in Scotland. In this special
Herald supplement, Francis Shennan and John Grady highlight the benefits
to be gained from, and the dangers of ignoring, growing Scottish
companies.
SCOTLAND'S future depends on growing companies -- and not only
Scotland's. All around the world the companies listed on the nations'
stock exchanges are changing.
Corporations which were listed only 20 years ago are being replaced by
companies which have been started more recently. While the day-to-day
news report focuses on whether and how well we are emerging from
recession, there are increasing signs that this was not the trough in a
routine economic cycle.
According to Scottish Enterprise's director of business development
Russel Griggs, who is interviewed on page three: ''The day of the big
corporate structure has probably passed. We are going through a period
of transition. This has not been a normal recession -- it is a
restructuring of the world economy.''
What this means is that business growth is important not only to the
individual companies but to the rest of us. Without Scottish companies
prepared to take on the work of expanding, our future jobs and the state
of our economy will suffer.
The figures to support this view are now available. Scottish
Enterprise began compiling a data base of companies which had been
started in the past 10 years and whose turnover topped #1m a year.
At present the number of companies listed stands at 203, although the
data base is not complete. Yet between them those companies employ 7600
people and their combined turnover is just under half-a-billion pounds.
There are two ways to look at these figures. First, the productivity
of the people employed in those firms is high. On average, those 203
companies employ 37 people each who generate business worth #2.5m.
In other words, the average company member is generating more than
#65,000 in turnover.
The other view, equally valid, is that the cost of creating new jobs
is growing. The days when we could look to major corporations to create
tens of thousands of jobs for us have gone.
Companies such as Shell, for example, will not return to the size of
workforce it had in the 1980s. There are two main reasons for this.
One is the constant development of technology which, far from slowing
down, is showing every sign of speeding up. Different technologies are
not only becoming more sophisticated, they are converging: combining
computers, television and telecommunications produce developments at a
geometrical rate of acceleration.
The other is the move towards outsourcing: finding outside sources for
goods and services which are not part of the corporation's core
activities. This allows the corporation to concentrate on what it does
best and not to involve itself in the details of those services.
All it has to do is to find another company to give the service it
needs at the best price it can get. Even activities which were once
believed could not be done outside are being outsourced, such as
accountancy services.
This fundamental change in the world's corporate structure presents
both a danger and an opportunity. The danger is that if we wait in line
for the corporation to start hiring, the line will always be larger than
the numbers being hired.
Even when Scotland wins inward investment, which it has been
successful in doing especially in sectors such as electronics, we will
not reap the sole benefits if we let the business of supplying those
companies go elsewhere.
Companies like IBM prefer to source their supplies locally, but what
it means by locally is Europe. In fact, national boundaries are becoming
increasingly meaningless to global companies.
To them, the world is made of economic regions -- Europe, North
America, the Pacific Rim -- and none of those regions is very far from
each other. Production and jobs can be moved between them to where the
markets and the economic conditions are most favourable.
Home-grown companies are more likely to keep jobs at home and, even
when they grow to an international scale, there is a better chance of
the head office remaining here.
It is not enough to start companies, important though that is.
Scotland has a number of companies which have grown well in the early
years and then settled at a certain level of turnover.
Sometimes they are taken over by larger competitors or by
mini-conglomerates looking to enter a new sector or to move into a
complementary market to their own core activity. More often than not,
these companies are headquartered outside of Scotland.
There tends to be two reasons for this. One is that the next stage of
growth for that company demands the resources of a larger corporate
parent.
It may, as in the case of Kirkintilloch-based McGavigan's which was
acquired for #9.5m by Pressac, be due to the high cost of research and
development needed to make that company a world leader in supplying the
automotive industry.
McGavigan's instrument display panel can be found in one in 10 of the
cars made in the world.
The second reason is that the growing company needs to move into a new
phase. After the years of the fast-moving, hands-on entrepreneur who is
able to grow the company in the early years, it may now need a more
formal corporate structure with a larger management team.
Managing this kind of change can be traumatic. The founder or founders
of the company will have to accept the need to delegate much of what
they enjoyed doing themselves and they may feel constricted by the
introduction of the kind of management controls which are necessary for
a larger enterprise.
If they cannot make the change themselves, they can either bring in a
fresh management team, leaving them free to concentrate their
entrepreneurial skills on new areas which the company may want to grow,
or sell all or part of the business, giving the funds to invest in
entirely new projects.
The injection of fresh management talent could come from programmes
which are specifically designed to develop it, such as the business
ventures programme, which is described in detail on page five.
Exit routes for investors and founders of companies are more easily
available, especially with the launch of the Alternative Investment
Market, as described briefly on pages six and seven. This will allow the
so-called ''serial entrepreneur'' to keep using his talents to generate
business growth.
What is certain is that Scotland, no more than any other country, can
afford to squander the talent of anyone who can grow businesses.

COMPANY growth depends on having the right team in place. Finding the
right management team is more than a matter of recruiting good
individuals, they have to grow into a cohesive unit who can act and
react well together.
Often the people who start a company are not the best ones to grow it.
At some point an injection of fresh management expertise may be needed.
The Business Ventures Programme sets out to grow management teams and
to put them in contact with new business ideas for the companies who
need their expertise.
It is not merely a training course, and it is not for the faint
hearted. Run by Business Ventures Ltd (BVL) it is funded by the Glasgow
Development Agency and the European Partnership.
Candidates are expected to have a minimum of #20,000 to invest. ''We
work at the top end of the market,'' says chief executive George
Hammersley. ''We are not looking to start one-person businesses. We are
looking for the bigger firm.''
Business Ventures Programme started in April 1993. Since then it has
achieved Scotland's highest business start-up rate, raising more than
#4m of equity to launch more than 20 new businesses.
''We take concrete opportunities,'' said Hammersley. ''We take people
who have a business idea but need it developed, companies that have just
started but are now struggling. Rather than that company disappearing,
it could be turned round by putting in additional management and
finance.''
Building teams can be the way out of financial trouble for struggling
companies. Bringing in new partners not only provides fresh ideas, it
also generates fresh capital investment and fresh skills.
The course does not rely on any psychological model of team-building,
but on bringing like-minded people together. Teams can then emerge
naturally. A residential weekend course at the Beardmore Hotel in
Clydebank is the starting venue. Through discussion, and often argument,
teams begin to emerge.
Pentranic Limited is the kind of venture which could not have been set
up without BVL. It is a joint venture with Canadian company Pentranic
Inc, run by Chinese Canadian James Lee, and operates in the computer
hardware sector of the games industry.
Allan Ewart, Alistair Murray and Asif Habib came together on the
Business Venture Programme. ''We went in with absolutely definite goals
in mind,'' said Ewart. ''I wanted to start a business and I was serious
about it.''
They had been looking at one or two projects, when Habib became
interested in Pentranic. ''The three of us locked ourselves in a room a
lot,'' said Ewart.
''We tried to dispense with the formalities of the programme. It got
very, very personal. We decided this was a stage we had to go through.
There was a lot of jostling for position in the early stages. We had to
address what our strengths and weaknesses were. It was like a therapy
session.''
Eventually the three settled on the roles they felt they should play.
''We had a lot of difficulty convincing people we were in the right
role,'' said Ewart. ''Alistair emerged in the leadership role but he had
no experience as such, although he has an MBA.
''I have an accountancy background but ended up in the sales role
while Asif has retail experience but is operations director. It was
based on what we were best suited for rather than the traditional
roles.''
Techniques for creating, growing or spotting entrepreneurs vary but
BVL concentrates on those with experience and money to invest. It then
puts them together with similar people and later with good business
opportunities.
It works with teams for nine months to a year. From the start it
stresses the importance of adequate funding -- at least enough to carry
it through the first three years. By the third year BVL wants to see
firms doing business of more than #1m.
Each participant has paid #375 for the course, which is in fact a lot
less than the actual cost but it is seen as a token of commitment. They
are selected by CV and interviews. All have management experience, and
all are keen to succeed. By now, BVL staff have a good idea what to look
for.
Hammersley's team of eight includes two accountants and a venture
capitalist. ''All have experience of working with start-up companies,''
he said. ''We are looking for people who are good at their jobs.
''They must have motivation and an 'awkward streak'. We put in a room
people who are relatively like-minded. I am trying to start with the
most committed group of 20 people I can get. They are hungry. They are
eager. These are not meak and mild people we deal with.''
The programme offers companies and individuals the opportunity to make
the most of their combined skills to build success. The emphasis is on
finding the right teams to achieve this. It can also offer these
companies the chance to bring in new inward investment from North
American companies like Pentranic Inc who would not otherwise be
investing in Europe. ''We work closely with Locate in Scotland,'' said
Hammersley. ''We identify young companies, doing $10m to $30m four to
five years old, maybe struggling a bit financially but having a product
or service that can come to the UK.''
Transatlantic links are more difficult to achieve. BVL has been
working in the US and Canada since 1993, but it is only recently they
have really seen results. They aim to have four or five transatlantic
companies up and running by the end of this year.
BVL have set themselves an ambitious target. They want to double the
amount of their creation over the next two years, taking on 120 people
each year, instead of the current 60.
In programmes such as those run by BVL, companies tend not to be grown
from scratch but are put together from a skilled base formed by people
who want their companies to grow.
The methods used by BVL emphasise the importance of building the right
team for the job. It is essential that all members of the team work
together, harnessing their own individual expertise and ability to the
company's success.
Each team member contributes to, and taps into, the pool of skills in
the group, increasing the company's chances of growth.
Though only two years old, the success rate of the Business Ventures
Programme has been impressive and there is no reason to doubt the
survival rate of the companies it has acted as midwife to will be any
less so.

NEWCASTLE United are ready to swoop for Aberdeen's Scott Booth. The St
James' Park club have contacted Aberdeen and been quoted #2m for the
fit-again striker.
That valuation will not deter manager Kevin Keegan, who is keen to
unite the explosive pace of Booth with the aerial power of Les
Ferdinand.He has been monitoring the stalemate between Aberdeen and
23-year-old Booth, who is out of contract tomorrow.
Booth has already put his house up for sale in readiness for any move
away from Aberdeen. He said: ''I have come through an extremely hard
time since being injured playing for Scotland against Russia eight
months ago. But all my physical problems are behind me now.
''I spoke to the manager before he left on holiday, but no offer was
made. I am still totally in the dark over my situation.''
Rangers are expected to tie up a #1.5m deal for Booth's team-mate,
Stephen Wright, within the next week.
* THE news that David Pleat has been given the all clear to take over
as manager of Sheffield Wednesday could hasten the transfer of
midfielder Trevor Steven from Rangers.
Pleat is a long-time admirer of the former England midfielder, whose
Ibrox future is in doubt following the capture of Paul Gascoigne.
Frenchman Basile Boli could be another who will leave Ibrox soon.
Several clubs back in his own country have been linked with him. Lyon
are one and Bordeaux another, and the Scottish champions would be happy
to set up a deal which would take the powerful defender off their books
after his disastrous #2m move from Marseille last summer.
* MIKE Smith yesterday paid the price for Wales' failure in the
European Championship when he was sacked as manager.
* JIM Glass's promised bid for control of Hearts, which he had hoped
to make this week, was placed on hold yesterday when he flew off to
Florida for a holiday.
Last week, Glass was optimistic that his formal move would be made
yesterday or at least by the end of this week, but he admitted yesterday
that he had been forced to revise the timescale.
* HRISTO Stoichkov, the Barcelona striker, looks set to join UEFA Cup
holders Parma next season.
''All that's missing is the signature. We consider the deal
practically done,'' said Parma president Giorgio Pedraneschi.

THE Centre Court rose to a new hero yesterday when Greg Rusedski's
determination, confidence, and raging serve killed off the Wimbledon
dream of Guy Forget in a thrilling four-set match, and the adopted
Englishman thoroughly deserved the acclaim.
At the end of a match which lasted two hours and 22 minutes the crowd
looked more drained than even Rudeski, who celebrated by throwing just
about everything he owned (apart from his two passports, of course), it
seemed, into the outstretched arms of his new-found legions.
''Even God seemed to be on his side,'' said Forget. When the
Frenchman, seeded 16, hit a dreadfully weak backhand return to a second
serve out of play to give Rusedski a 6-1, 7-6, 7-6, 7-5 victory,
Rusedski threw his racket into the crowd, then a head band, and a shirt,
too.
Then he bent down and, for a horrible moment, it seemed as though he
was reaching for his chair, but it was only to pick up his bag before
strutting off court with clenched fist raised above his head.
It was a remarkable match, during which Rusedski, whose serve has been
timed at 137mph, which is one mile per hour faster than that of even
Goran Ivanisevic, served 28 aces, but also double-faulted 13 times.
Yet, when the match started Forget looked as though he was cruising
into the third round, winning the first five games. When Rusedski held
serve for the first time in the sixth game he turned to the crowd and
flashed a smile full of white teeth.
Whatever else he may be, the Canadian who has used his mother's
English nationality to become a British player, is certainly dashing and
has the credentials to become the player who finally gives Wimbledon's
regulars something about which to puff out their chests again.
''If he serves like that he certainly could,'' said Forget after he
recovered from his disappointment. ''However, I hope he has many more
rackets, because if he is going to keep throwing them away he might run
out.''
Rusedski will play Olivier Delaitre in the third round and, if he
survives, will meet Pete Sampras in the last 16. Then we will discover
exactly the stuff of which the new hero is made.
After he had recovered from his slow start Rusedski looked to be
drawing strength from the crowd and, as he grow in confidence, so the
atmosphere became even more charged. Eventually one was feeding off the
other and Forget was frozen out.
Rusedski simply refused to be beaten and in the second set tie-break
he won five successive points to come from behind. The second tie-break
was easier, and Rusedski won his first break of serve in the final game
of the fourth set. By then Forget was battling against too many
opponents.
''It was such a great feeling, I've dreamed of winning on the Centre
Court here and now I've done it,'' Rusedski said. ''I think the crowd
had a lot to do with it. In fact, they never gave up on me and they won
the match for me. They did it. With this type of support anything can
happen.
''It's a wonderful feeling to be playing like that at home.''
Hold it, Greg. Don't get carried away boy. Playing at home? Isn't home
in Montreal?
The high noon encounter out on Court 14 offered conclusive evidence
that Miles Maclagan, who was born in Zambia, is British all right. He
lost badly, just like a good Brit, a real one, usually does in this
tournament.
The 20-year-old, who has been claimed by the English and the Scottish,
was whacked soundly by another Brit, Chris Wilkinson, who has fallen out
with his country because of the willingness to award Greg Rusedski
citizenship, the country's No.1 ranking, and a place in the Davis Cup
team. A row has been gowing on over this issue, but first let us deal
with Maclagan, who lost 6-1, 6-0, 6-2 in only 85 minutes.
Let the English have him. If he had won they would be claiming him
and, in any case, the player himself says he is a product of their
system. Played like one, too.
Maclagan looked completely bewildered by his experience and he might
now lose the Davis Cup place, which he only recently won. There is no
possibility of Wilkinson being in the squad, because he refuses to play
now that Rusedski has been adopted.
The Davis Cup captain, David Lloyd, said that Wilkinson and Rusedski
should sit down together and talk out their differences, but Wilkinson,
who is Britain's No.4 ranked player, said: ''I have said all I want to
about this and there there is no way I will go back on what I've already
said.''
What he said was that it was wrong for the tennis authorities to allow
Rusedski a place in the Davis Cup team, because he is a Canadian. Not
now, he isn't. The Wimbledon patriots have claimed him also.

ONE of the fastest-growing sectors of British and American economies
-- a trend unmatched in Germany and Japan -- has been that of
consultancy services. The range of expertise that can be bought in this
way is greater than ever: specialist manufacturing consultants, total
quality management, BS5750, statistical process control, just in time,
manufacturing resource planning, cellular manufacturing, management
organisational development, and so the list goes on.
It tends to be easiest to make the decision to buy in specialist
expertise for limited projects, such as bringing in software or
telecommunications experts to advise on re-equipping the office or
plant. When it comes to advice on the core of the business, such as the
management structure, personnel or marketing, it may be more difficult.
For one thing, the decision to examine a major area of the business may
have an impact elsewhere. A good marketing plan, for example, will
depend on financial position, production capability and quality of
personnel.
Sometimes the solution to problems is not immediately apparent but in
retrospect may seem obviously correct. A dairy company which wanted to
diversify but had neither a brand name nor a sales force was pointed by
its consultant in the direction of contract production. Its customers
had the marketing capacity but did not want to make the investment in
plant which the dairy company already had.
Management consultants can advise on corporate strategy and business
development, working with directors to decide on new strategies,
products or markets. They can not only help with the recruitment of
senior personnel but with deciding what kind of people and management
structure are needed.
In these situations asking in an outsider, however qualified, might
seem less like consultation and more like abdication. ''Companies often
make the mistake of having the consultant work in isolation,'' said John
Ker, Arthur Andersen's partner in charge of operational consulting in
Scotland. ''In that situation the knowledge disappears with the
consultant when he or she goes and there is limited lasting value from
the project.
''It is important for the client and consultant to work in partnership
together so ownership of the project can be transferred to the client
throughout its duration.''
Every company is different, with its own problems, challenges and
solutions for survival, but one that does nothing more than survive
offers little more than a livelihood and an insecure one at that. It
might decide not to grow, but its competitors probably will and they
will be competing for the same market. To grow, it has to focus on the
long term.
Each step on the road to growth has particular characteristics but
tends to make a similar demand for quality people who can grow with the
business, learning new skills in the process.
There are predictable times in a company's growth when an outside view
may be necessary to move on to the next stage. In the first stage of a
new venture, the business focuses on its market niche, developing its
product or service. Any limitations in management resources are not
always apparent and the successful founders of the company have the
knowledge and the personal commitment to keep control.
By the second stage the business is established in a market offering
long-term profitable growth, but it will need the people who can bring
that growth about. The resources of the original management team will
become stretched. As they delegate they have to ensure adequate channels
of communication. They will also have to change the way they work and
learn new management skills.
Changes may mean errors creeping in, with a decline in product quality
or service, threatening the very move towards growth that is giving rise
to the problems. More individual effort may not be enough to counter
this: it may need new working procedures to be put in place.
One metal fabrications company grew its turnover significantly but
found its productivity declining. By improving the management structure
with the help of consultants, the structure and role of the management
team was changed to make better use of their skills. Management was able
to perform better, focusing on everyone delivering objectives, and
productivity increased by 20%.
The third stage sees a growth in staff numbers at most levels. As more
people have management roles, their responsibilities must be defined and
management controls introduced. This will involve giving up some if not
most of the entrepreneurial style of the early days. Some owner-managers
find it difficult to embrace this change which can mean accepting
restrictions on the level of their control. Some of the executives they
will need to recruit may know more and have more experience in
conventional management terms.
Successful ones realise they have to delegate decision-making and
become facilitators, giving employees the tools to work to the optimum
level and to take responsibility for their own output. Middle managers
often find these changes difficult and need help developing new
management skills.
If they have the courage to move from an entrepreneurial to a
professionally-managed company they are faced with the problem of the
fourth stage, which is one of consolidation or stagnation, depending how
well it is handled. Many recruits to the business may have missed the
period of the company's fastest growth and will need to be imbued with
that culture so they have a clear idea of where the company is trying to
go.
That culture has to be one of continuous improvement throughout the
workforce to prevent increased turnover and a larger staff straining the
company's system. Managers expecially have to be helped to grow with the
company.
''The consultant can be a source of new skills, for example in
team-building and the culture change prospect,'' said Ker.

If a small company is to maintain its edge it may have to invest in
replacement technology.
SMALLER fast-growing companies can not only compete with the big boys
-- they can have the edge over them.
The key is their ability to respond faster than the large corporations
and especially to leapfrog them in the use of technology. The PC has
become the fulcrum with which one man -- or woman -- can move the world.
Russel Griggs, Director of Business Development at Scottish
Enterprise, goes as far as saying: ''The PC
in the hands of a single entrepreneur makes him as powerful as IBM in
some ways. You can be as upfront and as aggressive as a large company.
''All the evidence suggests that it is the small and medium-sized
companies that are picking up new technology ahead of the large firms.
That's where their USP (Unique Selling Point) is.
''It may be that small and medium companies need to get into the
technology earlier. That is where the relationship with the financial
community needs to get better. Banks are spending a lot of time helping
their managers understand that.''
If the smaller but growing company is to maintain its edge it may mean
investing in replacement technology before the equipment it replaces is
obsolete. This can put increased financial pressure on the company.
It also demands a close relationship between the company, its bank and
any other lenders and investors. Only if the financial backers properly
understand the reasons for the additional expenditure will they make the
resources available. ''One of the difficulties for the banks is that if
they just base their lending decisions on the gearing ratios of today,
they could stop a lot of good companies moving forward,'' said Griggs.
''What they are investing in is the future.''
Banks are useful for more than loans. Their merchant banking arms,
such as the Bank of Scotland's subsidiary British Linen Bank, can also
be part of financial packages that bring in equity partners.
The funding situation for small firms is ''a lot better than it was'',
said Griggs, adding: ''The banks have taken a very positive attitude.
They have done work with us on the Small Business Loan Scheme.''
They have also been valuable in things like the LINC network, which is
referred to affectionately as the ''host of angels''. These are
experienced businessmen and entrepreneurs who can both bring expertise
and attract funding to growing companies which they take under their
wings. And banks have worked closely with Scottish Development Finance,
the venture capital arm of Scottish Enterprise.
''But I think the area we still will have some challenges in is how we
get small companies to invest in technology in advance of real
returns,'' said Griggs.
The owners/managers of growing firms could be forgiven if believing
they are being given mixed messages. On the one hand they are being
warned of the dangers of undercapitalisation, over-borrowing and growing
too fast for their resources or their management structure. On the other
they are being advised that they must take advantage of the edge that
technology can give them.
This paradox is only apparent, however, technology which makes them
more efficient and competitive is not an add-on luxury. Expenditure on
it should be included in projects of the capital costs the company must
meet. At the same time they must make a realistic assessment of the
returns that technology will give them.
''Me too,'' purchases or corporate virility symbols might buy them a
few nights preening in front of colleagues, but if the added efficiency
cannot be quantified it probably does not exist.
Advocating expenditure in advance of the benefits the expenditure will
bring is not an argument for wishful thinking. It is an argument for the
most rigorous scrutiny of the projected benefits. Ideally all
expenditure would be subjected to the same scrutiny; the price of new
cars for the directors can buy an awful lot of software and computing
power these days.
The same kind of critical assessment would ease the path of attracting
investors. One thing which even the most benevolent of angels will be
looking for is an exit route. This does not mean they will be anxious to
jump ship at the first hint of trouble. Quite the contrary, if they are
experienced entrepreneurs who have been through difficult experiences
themselves.
However, even the most worthy and worthwhile company must give an
investor the realistic hope that they will be able to realise literally,
to make real -- their investment. The launch of the Alternative
Investment Market earlier this month should prove to be a major
seachange.
Apart from the lower costs of having your company traded on the AIM
compared to the full Stock Exchange, there will be no minimum proportion
of shares which has to be trade on the market. So owners can keep hold
of as much of their company as is consistent with the funds they need to
raise.
''One of the things which has held the UK back in the past has been
the capital market,'' said Griggs. ''That is why the Alternative
Investment Market is so fundamentally important to the future of
Scotland and of the UK. Those companies that have been afraid to go for
a full listing will now be able to control the amount of shares they put
on to the market.''
The prospects for business growth in Scotland are promising, though
there is no room for complacency. ''We have as many would-be
entrepreneurs as anywhere else,'' said Griggs. ''Something stops them
making it happen.
''Part of it is cultural. They are not valued enough by the community
as a whole. One of the things we are going to do is to make it clear how
important they are. If we don't get entrepreneurs we have a severe
economic problem.
''Everyone thinks funding is a problem but when I speak to
entrepreneurs they tell me it wasn't. That if you have a good enough
idea you will find funding.
''Entrepreneurs are not bastards. All the ones I know in Scotland are,
without exception genuinely nice human beings. They just set their
sights higher than most of us.''
Russel Griggs: 'the PC in the hands of a single entrepreneur makes him
as powerful as IBM in some ways'

SCOTLAND has long prided itself on its tradition of innovation and
there is plenty of evidence that the Scots are an innovative people. The
resulting high-value work is especially important to a country on the
geographical periphery of the world's largest market.
It can provide a valuable source of income for companies, especially
smaller ones. They do not have to proceed to full production on a volume
scale: a licensing agreement can provide an income stream through
royalties. The more aware financial institutions will now treat a
patent-protected innovation with market potential as a capital asset.
As the recession began to ease there were signs of increased patenting
activity among smaller companies. The South of England especially saw a
sharp decline as the recession took hold. Among larger firms this type
of activity tends to be less affected by the economic cycle. Definitive
figures are hard to find though. There is no central register of
Scottish patents and applications can be made through Scottish patent
agents, the UK Patent Office, or even the European Patent Office.
Advice on innovation is available from a number of bodies, including
local enterprise companies, the Department of Trade and Industry, the
Scottish Office Industry Department, Euro information centres and
Scottish Innovation. The areas on which companies will need advice,
though, are even more numerous: intellectual property, patents,
licensing, royalties, marketing, finance and venture capital.
Innovation, though, is more than ''gee whiz'' hi-tech. As Michael
Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, once put it: ''Companies can
innovate simply by finding a way of doing something better than they did
before. It is a process of constantly seeking to improve performance.''
This form of innovation is essential to every successful firm, but
taking the technological route to a lead over your rivals can produce
big returns -- and big risks.
A prime example is Cairntech, an Inverkeithing company which has
become expert at security devices for telephones, faxes and radios. A
big market always seemed to be just around the corner but it stayed out
of reach. Three years ago it came within three months of closing. Then
Timothy Laing, its managing director and 95% owner, came up with the
idea of a tapeless answering machine, using a memory chip instead of a
cassette.
His technical team lost several nights sleep working on the project,
which involved data compression. Unless voice messages could be
compressed by a third the cost of the machine would have been too high.
In two weeks they knew they could produce it and in three months they
had a real machine. Laing approached BT, for whom Cairntech had earlier
produced a telephone conferencing system though it had failed as the
recession had hit potential buyers.
Cairntech's specification matched BT's specifications for an answering
machine which was about to go out to tender, but it had only three weeks
to produce costings and find a manufacturer. Hughes Microelectronics was
chosen.
Eight months after Cairntech's first designs were produced, the
combined telephone and answering machine, no larger than a simple phone
and complete with a remote control, had passed BSI tests. It went on
sale 18 months ago under BT's name of Response 120. It has new features,
such as a pre-recorded message, because new answering-machine users
often forget to record an outgoing message.
BT's initial order was worth #10m and all sales expectations were
exceeded. Yet Cairntech's subsidiary, The Phone Box, formed to handle
the machine, only just avoided a loss on the first production run, even
though it boosted monthly turnover from #4500 to #450,000. The reason
was that margins were kept very tight so it could get a foot in the BT
door. This approach worked because it went on to work for BT on another
model.
Innovation costs money. Funding from both the UK Government and the
European Union is channelled through the DTI and the Scottish Office
Industry Department. Grants and awards are available but the number and
their widely differing criteria produce a maze almost as complex as some
of the research and development.
The Regional Enterprise Grant for Innovation, for example, is for
''most manufacturing activities'' but not man-made fibres and yarns and
includes fisheries and ''certain'' agricultural products. SMART Awards
-- Small firms Merit Awards for Research and Technology -- are
competitive, with companies competing against each other for grants to
stimulate innovative projects.
European Innovation Awards read like a word game where the object is
to make names out of the initials: ESPRIT (European Strategic Programme
for Research and Information Technology), RACE (Research in Advance
Communications in Europe), COST (European Co-operation in Scientific and
Technical Research), and many more.
Most innovators find the procedures surrounding SMART straightforward
compared to many other sources of grants and awards. These sources have
the advantage -- yes, advanatage -- of offering relatively modest,
though significant, amounts of money.
For the main problem with commercial backing from venture capitalists
has traditionally been that it is not usually worth their while getting
involved in investments of less than #1m. The Chancellor's decision to
introduce a form of investment trust called Venture Capital Trusts was
aimed at helping fill this funding gap.
The view of the venture capital company, though, tends to be that
innovative companies fail less because of the nature of the innovation
than the quality of the management. Venture capitalists cannot be
expected to fill the gaps in a management team, especially if their
investment is small. They will achieve a better return putting large
amounts into more mature companies which require less attention. Even
when they make a substantial investment and perhaps put a non-executive
director on the board, he or she is not there to run the company but to
be consulted.
Ironically, a 1990 report on innovations in the UK found that the
venture capital industry had at its disposal five times more funding
than is available to its opposite numbers in Japan and 15 times more
than in Germany. However, the proportion of the funds devoted to
start-up and early stage financing produces a different picture. While
0.1% of funds are invested in seed capital in the UK, the US utilises 2%
solely for this purpose.
The key to convincing investors tends to be the all-important business
plan. It is usually an accountant who has the final say on whether a
project proceeds.

BICC is well known for its cables operation but the Balfour Beatty
construction division is keen to grow its share of the UK building
market. It has historically had a presence in Scotland where it has a 6%
market share.
Recent commissions include the design and construction of the second
stage expansion of the international facilities at Glasgow airport, the
new printing complex for the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail in
Glasgow and the #4m redevelopment of Ibrox stadium for Rangers football
club.
Alistair Wivell, managing director of Balfour Beatty Construction,
said the group is now aiming to increase its share of the market south
of the Border from its current level of 1%.
While the demand for new buildings remains depressed, refurbishment of
offices, council housing and student accommodation continues apace. In
addition to this market Balfour Beatty Construction is actively involved
in the growing market for hospital design and build work. Among its
health portfolio is the new district hospital in Ayr and a theatre suite
and intensive therapy unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
BICC Construction believes that it has a number of operational
advantages including its network of offices around the country and the
ability to draw on the expertise of other parts of the BICC group, such
as Haden facilities management.
However, the business has no intention of repeating the mistakes of
the 1980s when virtually all construction companies over-expanded and
therefore had to retrench sharply during the 1990s' recession. It is
actively building up partnership relationships with major customers such
as C&amp;A and sub-contractors and is keen to play a role in the
Government's Private Finance Initiative, aimed at bringing private
sector finance and expertise to public infrastructure projects.

IT was as though the elements had chosen to misbehave over Wimbledon
yesterday when the sound of thunder resounded across clear blue skies,
but before the order was given to stand by with the court covers, the
source of the noise was traced to just outside the Centre Court complex,
where the mighty Goran Ivanisevic was taking care of business and
Jonathan Stark.
The American lost in straight sets, but he should have been awarded a
medal for valour. Ivanisevic boomed down 28 aces as well as a number of
service winners which stunned Stark, a 24-year-old from Seattle, who did
remarkably well to win so many games and take Ivanisevic to a tie-break
in the third set.
In the end, however, the Croat's thundering power was too much and,
rather than slip out of the premises quietly given the growing concern
about the way in which heavy hitters have hijacked Wimbledon and reduced
rallies to a minimum, he stood his ground and spoke in favour of his
kind. ''You want slow tennis, you go to the French Open,'' he said after
his 6-4, 6-2, 7-6 second-round win. ''You'll see plenty of tennis there.
''Me, I like Wimbledon even if they have made the balls heavier. They
can put water in them if they like I wouldn't care, because I'd still
hit 20 to 30 aces. Don't come here to Wimbedon to see tennis. What do
you want, women's tennis or to see people hit the ball?
''It isn't my fault I can hit the ball hard. People think you have to
go the gym and pump iron to serve hard, to be like Schwarzenegger, but
you don't. It's an action. But aces aren't all I have. I served 209 of
them in '92 and I won nothing.''
Fair enough, big guy, but what about the need to entertain the crowds,
to bring them to their feet in the way that only thrilling rallies can?
''I don't care, I don't come to Wimbledon to entertain. I come because
it is the biggest tournament in the world and because the courts are
fast. If I want to entertain then I will play exhibition matches.''
Ladbrokes offered odds of 11-10 against Ivanisevic, who was beaten in
last year's final by Pete Sampras, a finale which was described as one
of the most boring Wimbledon matches ever, smiling if he plays on Centre
Court, and when this was pointed out to him he replied: ''That's crazy.
I smile all the time.''He was straight-faced, of course, and then added:
''Well, if I do play on Centre Court I'll make sure I smile all the
time.''
However, if many of the traditionalists frown on the Ivanisevic
heavy-duty tennis he is a hero of the the young girls who flock to
Wimbledon every day. ''Yes, the young girls always cheer for me,'' he
said. ''I suppose it is better than having the young boys cheering me.''
There was a lot of cheering on Court 1, where Britain's Tim Henman was
playing the defending champion, Pete Sampras, and the old arena trembled
in anticipation when the Brit broke the Sampras serve in the opening
game of the third set. However, Sampras recovered and won the match 6-2,
6-3, 7-6.
Asked if the young Englishman has a chance of doing something in the
sport, Sampras said: ''Possibly. He has an all-round game, but he needs
to develop a weapon. In fact, he reminds me of Jeremy Bates.''
Oh dear. Perhaps young Master Henman ought to consider restructuring
his entire game.

SUSAN MacDONALD, the top goal-scorer at the recent European Nations
Cup in Amsterdam, has retained her place in the Great Britain Olympic
training squad along with six of her Scotland team-mates.
Diane Renilson, Susan Fraser, Janet Jack, Pauline Robertson, Rhona
Simpson, and goalkeeper Tracey Robb join MacDonald in the pool of
players from which the party of 19 will be selected for the tour to
Australia in August.
The large Scottish contingent is in the main justified, although Jack
would be first to admit that she has not been playing at her best in
recent months. Great Britain coach Sue Slocombe has obviously kept faith
with her, following Jack's outstanding performances against the USA in
San Diego earlier this year, but Slocombe must also find difficulty in
justifying a number of her other selections.
The most surprising include the England captain, Sandie Lister, who
announced her retirement from international hockey just prior to the
Nations Cup, while Karen Brown took a similar decision with regards to
GB after Barcelona three years ago.
Question marks must also be raised over the inclusion of Jill Atkins
and Chris Cooke, who struggled at the heart of the England defence in
Amsterdam, while Tiny Cullen's single goal against inferior opposition
like Belgium, Italy, Ireland, and France hardly strengthens her claim
for a place among the forwards.
Slocombe has also seen fit to bring in two English players who did not
figure in Amsterdam, and with four members of her former club Clifton
included, her sense of loyality might also be questioned.
The selection of young players like Anna Bennett, Lucy Cope, Lucy
Culliford, Lucy Youngs, Charlotte Merrett and Yana Williams has to be
welcomed, for this is after all an extremely old squad by modern
standards. But in the same concept it does come as a surprise that no
places have been found for young Scots Helen Walker and Susan Gilmour.
Granted this pair were used as back-up players in Amsterdam, but both
did sufficient to suggest that exposure at a new level, such as a Great
Britain training squad, just might have helped speed up their
development. Moreover, Gilmour at least equalled the feat of Cullen and
scored a goal. Squad:
Jill Atkins, Lisa Bayliss, Anna Bennett, Karen Brown, Chris Cooke,
Lucy Cope, Tiny Cullen, Lucy Culliford, Mandy Davis, Sandie Lister,
Tammy Miller, Mandy Nicholls, Hilary Rose, Jane Smith, Jo Thompson, Lucy
Youngs, Jane Sixsmith (all England), Susan Fraser, Janet Jack, Susan
MacDonald, Diane Renilson, Tracey Robb, Pauline Robertson, Rhona Simpson
(all Scotland), Charlotte Merrett, Yana Williams (both Wales).

IF the phrase ''information superhighway'' makes you want to take the
next exit and you think ''fibre optics'' are for keeping your whisky
warm, it's time to look again at technology.
It is easy to get lost in the ''techno-babble'' surrounding some of
the latest advances, but looking beyond the jargon, no company, big or
small, can afford to ignore the importance of technology in keeping
businesses alive and growing.
Information is the life-blood of any modern business and this decade
has seen a wealth of new ways to channel the flow of information. Those
who can access and use it quickly will remain a step ahead of their
competition.
Telecommunications are now essential to every business. Its advantages
are not only speed and capacity, but reach. Scotland's geographical
position in the European Union would be a serious problem but for
effective telecommunications.
The affordability and reliability of Telecom's services have been
dramatically, if quietly, changing work patterns. This can free growing
companies from the cost of expanding or changing premises simply to
accommodate additional staff.
One in five people spend at least part of each week working from home
and in Scotland nearly half of the working population are expected to
increase the amount of time spent working from home, according to
research by SW2000, an Oxford-based firm of forecasters.
As well as increased flexibility and convenience, working from home
can cut down time and travel costs.
According to findings by Aberdeen University's Psychology Department,
people who work from home are less likely to suffer from stress, take
less time off for illness, and are more adaptable if working hours
change.
The equipment needed for this is little more than a personal computer,
a fax machine and a separate business line.
As well as the phone and fax, electronic mail makes communicating with
staff in different areas -- or even different time zones -- as simple as
sending memos to staff in the office.
Even the simplest telephone services -- such as call waiting, call
diversion, and three way calling, available cheap from BT and Mercury --
can help to ease congestion on lines whether at head office or in
out-workers' homes.
BT's Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) has been designed to
offer increased clarity on telephone lines, making it useful for the
transmission of large quantities of data.
The real increases in efficiency, however, are to be achieved from
convergence: combining telephones and computers. Staff who are on the
road or in satellite offices can use phones to interrogate head office
computers.
In many companies voice and data systems still run on different types
of cable and making any changes to your system may mean re-cabling the
entire office. Modern cabling means all your equipment can be part of
the same wiring scheme. Satellite technology even makes it possible to
be in two places at once. A system known as CamNet, developed by BT and
in use at the RGIT survival centre in Aberdeen allows for remote
diagnosis.
CamNet and similar technologies mean businesses will soon be able to
send technicians out to sites while more advanced specialists receive
visual information and make diagnosis from the base.
Telecommunications, in the widest sense, are expected to be the growth
industry for the future and any attempt at definitive description of
available systems will probably be incomplete or quickly out of date.
The key to its successful use is to decide on the company's needs, and
to find the technology that fits those needs. ''Gee whiz'' devices
quickly become redundant, if they do not serve your business.
Machines should work for you, not the other way around.

LAURA Davies will be back in action in the #350,000 Hennessy Cup, the
second richest event on the American Express Tour this year, which
begins at Refrafth, Cologne, today.
Liselotte Neumann, the British Open champion from Sweden, is defending
the title she has won for the last two years against the strongest field
of the season. Neumann had to come in after nine holes in yesterday's
pro-am to have a stomach muscle treated, but expects to play today.
Scotland's Pam Wright has been unable to obtain a release from the
LPGA in America and is the only notable absentee.
Davies makes no secret of wanting to add the Hennessy Cup to the 36
titles she has won worldwide since 1985. ''Most of the girls regard this
as a major,'' she said, and there is another target -- a fourth
order-of-merit title. She is currently leading with #56,082.
The select field of 66 includes Scots Dale Reid and Gillian Stewart,
joint ninth last year, and Julie Forbes.

VETERAN Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the father of ''total football'',
the man who made Ajax a household name in European soccer, and who gave
Holland an international stature they had never enjoyed before, has been
chosen to show us the way ahead for our national game.
Michels, possibly the most respected coach in Europe, was at Hampden
yesterday sitting alongside Ernie Walker and the others who will make up
the Independent Review Commission which will attempt to plot the future
progress of football in this country.
He is joined by Swedish FA general secretary Lars-Christer Olsson,
Lord Ranald MacLean, chairman of the SFA's Appeals Board and Senator of
the College of Justice, Tony Higgins, secretary of the Players' Union,
and Martin Rose, secretary of the Scottish Federation of Football
Supporters Clubs.
But the main burden of the commission will surely fall on Walker and
the two men he has brought in from Europe to join his think tank.
Walker knows their worth. His time in UEFA and FIFA has given him a
rare insight into the game abroad, possibly one unique in our domestic
game.
Equally, his stature abroad is such that he has been able to attract a
major football figure in Michels and an emerging legislative genius in
Olsson to come to the game's aid.
The input from Michels will be most important of all. The Old Dutch
Master has already identified some of the problems of the Scottish game,
though to be fair to both him and our domestic product, he admitted with
some gusto that he enjoyed watching Scottish matches.
He added: ''There is a lot in the Scottish, or the British game, that
has to be admired. There is the spirit of the players, and the attitude
and the feeling which exists between the teams and the supporters.
''When people come from Holland to this country they like what they
see. When they look at the games on television they enjoy them. I do
too. Just to watch the games is fine. There is excitement and there is
action.''
Ernie Walker intervened: ''It can be great theatre. There is a lot of
drama and there are bodies falling everywhere, but there is a marked
division from the game as played here and the game played in Europe.''
Michels continued: ''When I was coaching and I knew that we were to
play a Scottish or an English team then I would tell my players to keep
possession. That was our way of taking your passion away from the
game.''
The task which Michels will take up with the commission will not deal
primarily with the premier division, of course. His expertise in the
development of young talent will take priority.
Walker said: ''The major complaint from clubs and coaches is that the
talent which was once coming through is not there any longer. I spoke to
Walter Smith recently about this and he told me that youngsters coming
to Ibrox do not have the basic skills the way they used to.
''I know there is always a danger that we look back at the old days
and think they were so much better, but I don't think that is the case
here. There is a lack of talent and we have to address that problem
before anything else.''
''We have had this problem ourselves,'' smiled Michels, ''though,
perhaps, people won't believe that today. But back in 1974 when I was
national coach to the team which reached the World Cup final in West
Germany, everyone in Holland thought that success would carry on
forever.
''But football is not like that and so when the development of young
players was neglected around that time our country found itself with
problems. When I returned as national coach in 1985 I tried to set up a
structure which would deliver good young players to the clubs.
''We are seeing the fruits of that now. It all takes time and it will
take time here in Scotland. But a similar set-up may work and that is
what I will be looking at in my time on the commission.''
Michels, though, also will speak to club coaches and to the SFA's own
technical department as he attempts to help our ailing game.
Walker added: ''This is not mission impossible. Progress can be made
and, if this initial effort is not an obvious success then it will have
set the ball rolling and it will be rolling in the right direction.
''That is the important thing. We have to be ready to accept change
for the better, and the fact that we have this commission in place
surely says that we know there are problems in the game and that we want
to improve.''
Walker anticipates that the Commission will meet around nine times a
season over a possible three-year period. He added: ''We will make
suggestions as we go along rather than wait until the end of the time
span. It will be better to do that and to try to make changes as soon as
possible to bring about the improvements everyone wants.''

IAN Ross, the manager of Scottish champions Kingussie, confirmed this
week that he will remain in charge for another year. He had intended to
step down following the season just ended.
He said: ''We were delighted with our performances over the season.
People keep on writing us off but we will still be the team to beat in
the new National Premier League.
''I am prepared to accept that challenge for another year, with Jim
Gow as my assistant. It should be an interesting time as clubs adapt to
the new set-up.''
Ross was speaking as his club -- along with beaten Camanachd Cup
finalists Oban Camanachd -- came out on top in the final allocation of
Marine Harvest shinty club-of-the-month awards.
The respective league champions from the north and south have picked
up the last of the #100 awards.
Strathglass and Tayforth, the respective division two champions,
received the #50 runners-up prizes.

INCLUSION in the Scottish team that leaves for Lyon, France, on
Saturday has denied Cameron Black and Kirsty Hope the chance to dominate
the senior sections in the Hind Scottish Age-group championships
starting at Glasgow's Scotstoun Pool today.
However, the chances are they won't leave empty-handed. Black is
favourite to pick up the 17/18 year-old age-group 100m butterfly title
in today's opening session, and Hope is firm favourite for the 200m
backstroke tomorrow.
Cumbernauld's Karen Marie Lewis and her former clubmate Steven Kidd,
now with the City of Glasgow, should underline their potential in the 15
and 14 year-old sections respectively.
Craig Miller is another City of Glasgow youngster who should collect
several titles in the 17/18 year-olds.
The 19/24 year-old section has been deleted this year because of
falling numbers.
The event marks the national championship baptism for the new 10-lane
Scotstoun Pool.

SUDDENLY Wimbledon's lawns were not such wonderful surfaces after all,
so far as Mary Pierce was concerned. The fifth seed, playing in the
championships for the first time, got to perform on Centre Court
yesterday, but found that her French opponent, Nathalie Tauziat, was in
no mood to play a bit part in the newcomer's big day.
Pierce and her one-piece dress looked the part, but she seemed to
forget she was facing a woman scorned, and paid a heavy price. Pierce,
who holds three passports, elected to become French, which relegated
Tauziat from No.1 to second place.
Tauziat has harboured a grudge ever since, and yesterday was pay-back
time for the 27-year-old from Bayonne.
After she had won 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 she whooped with delight and punched
the air. She knew she had an excellent opportunity of beating Pierce,
who around these parts is as green as the surfaces, but she didn't
expect to see Pierce, her Federation Cup team-mate, collapse so meekly
in the final set. She went like a little girl who had strayed too far
into unfamiliar territory and was left questioning her decision to
include Wimbledon, which she had studiously avoided in the past, in her
schedule.
It was just another bad decision by Pierce, who must also feel she
made the wrong choice when she decided to become French instead of
American. She could have become a Canadian also, but living in Paris
seemed much more glamorous, although the thought of what she might have
earned had she presented her American passport instead is interesting.
Had she done that, she would have been the USA's No.1 ranked player,
the natural successor to Chris Evert. Martina Navratilova filled the
void left by the queen of the baseline, but she was much too uppity and
did not quite fit the Evert profile, whereas Pierce would have done.
She, too, is a baseliner, and comports herself with effortless grace.
America would have fallen madly in love with her. She can play, too, but
not it seems on grass.
''I just didn't play well at all today and I was up against someone
who has more experience of grass and who, in fact, is a great player on
it,'' she said. ''I didn't move well, didn't get enough first serves in,
and I made too many mistakes.''
Pierce sensed Tauziat was ''extremely focused'' during the match
because of the national rivalry, but the 20-year-old said she wasn't
thinking about any conflict caused by her arrival on the French scene.
''I'm very disappointed it's over so soon,'' Pierce continued, ''but I
don't think I'll shed a tear. I'll come back next year because I feel I
still have much to learn, and maybe someday I will be able to win the
Wimbledon championship.''
She doesn't know what she will do to fill in her free time now, but
she might go and do some more sessions with her mother Yannick's new
friend, who is a photographer and who has already had some work
published, with Pierce as the subject. She may be short of the
confidence and prowess required to go the distance at Wimbledon, but she
is hot property none the less.
Tauziat admitted she had been psyched more than usual because she had
been deprived of her status as France's leading female player. ''It was
important for me to win this one,'' she said. ''It lets certain people
know that I can play.''
The defending champion, Conchita Martinez, made the potentially
hazardous journey out to Court No.2, a patch which has been unkind to
seeds and favoured players throughout the competition's history.
However, all was well with her game and she beat Jana Kandarr 6-4, 6-3.
''I'm improving with every game and that's the way I like it,'' said
Martinez afterwards. ''If the improvement continues then, yes, I could
win the championship again.''
Fellow Spaniard Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the tenacious No.2 seed,
played one of the many Japanese women who have swarmed on to the circuit
but despite a difficult first set, which she won 7-5, she found her
range in the second set, taking it 6-2. ''It was difficult at the start,
but as I settled and concentrated better, my game began to come together
and I felt good by the end,'' she said.
Gabriela Sabatini, seeded No.8, is not short of supporters at
Wimbledon, where she has always under-achieved. Often, when the going is
hard, the Argentinian's game can fall apart in a most appalling manner,
but she was in full control yesterday, winning 6-2, 6-2 against Italy's
Silvia Farina.
Steffi Graf, who believes Martinez has the crown only on short-term
loan, had a rest day yesterday and left her coach, Heinz Gunthardt, to
explain why she withdrew from the doubles competition, in which she was
to partner Martina Navratilova. ''You all know Steffi has a sprained
wrist and a painful back, so we thought it was wise not to put added
pressure on these injuries,'' he said.
Graf's back problem is so acute that she will have to end her career
earlier than she had planned, and a sixth Wimbledon title would
certainly help ease both the physical and mental pain.

Women need better advice from doctors on the use of HRT, argues ANN
SHAW.
ONCE the menopause was a taboo subject. Today bookshelves are bulging
with volumes about it. You'd think it's just been discovered. In fact,
many feminists, including Germaine Greer, fear that the whole process is
in grave danger of being medicalised. What should be a natural
ageing-condition has suddenly become big business for the pharmaceutical
companies. Or has it?
Are women being ''encouraged'' to go on Hormone Replacement Therapy
(HRT) -- the buzz treatment of the 90s health scene -- simply to boost
drug profits, or is it really an elixir for the second half of life?
Teresa Gorman MP -- once involved in the Amarant Trust which promoted
HRT -- and television doctor Miriam Stoppard, are flag-waving supporters
of HRT.
Certainly amongst women in the 40-plus age bracket it's a major
talking point. Get any group of women together today and it's one
subject that will crop up as soon as health is discussed.
So, what do you do? Talk to your GP? He or she will smile sweetly,
give you a few facts then say: ''The decision is yours.'' Thanks. What
we want is someone to make the decision for us. After all, we are not
medically qualified.
So it was with some interest I picked up Sandra Coney's new book The
Menopause Industry (Women's Press, #8.99). I was optimistic that this
might be a valuable contribution to the debate. Unfortunately, it
rapidly became obvious that it is a diatribe against HRT.
For example, there are over 4,000,000 women aged between 45 and 60 in
the UK, and, Coney claims, large numbers are being persuaded to take
hormones. The facts are that less than 10% of women take HRT. Hardly
''large numbers''.
Her book is riddled with case histories of women who have had bad
experiences of both women's health-screening and HRT. Yet there is also
plenty of anecdotal evidence that HRT is beneficial.
However, Coney fails to produce examples of women who have benefited
from it.
So, who is Sandra Coney? She is a New Zealand journalist who made her
name by exposing the maltreatment of women with cervical cancer at the
National Women's Hospital in Auckland eight years ago.
Now she has turned her attention to the ''menopause industry'',
claiming that there is a frightening absence of any ethical regulations
governing the creation of ''cures'' for the menopause, and the
frightening growth of a billion-dollar industry allegedly based on
patient disinformation. Alarming stuff, you've got to admit.
But what are the facts? Most drugs have side-effects, and the longer
they are used the greater the potential damage. That much is undisputed.
The debate over HRT revolves around the fact that while its short-term
use for menopausal symptoms is accepted as a low risk and a highly
effective way to eliminate hot flushes and night sweats, and reduce the
risk of heart disease and osteoporosis in the long run, using it for
more than five to 10 years carries a risk of breast cancer, according to
some studies.
But there have been no long term studies on the use of HRT amongst
older women with a control group of women of similar age in good health
who have not taken it. That's the crux of the matter.
That's not to denounce HRT as a drug dreamed up by male-orientated
pharmaceutical companies simply to make a quick buck, then hyped up by
the media, and doctors.
A much more useful discussion on the subject is to be found in Dr
Christiane Northrup's book Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom (Piatkus,
#25). She is a holistic physician and a member of the Natural Healing
and Health Advisory Board in the United States. She says about half her
post-menopausal patients are on an HRT regimen.
''HRT needs to be kept in perspective. It is not the only way to
alleviate the problems that some (not all) women experience,'' says
Northrup.
She says the current ''medicalisation'' of the menopause has been so
successful that many women's own menopausal wisdom and trust in their
bodies to remain healthy during this natural life stage is almost
non-existent.
''Since I don't believe that the menopause is a deficiency disease, a
woman's desire to try HRT is the number one reason why I prescribe it.''
Given the current link between research funding, drug company profits
and the medical profession, she adds that it is unlikely that the kind
of ''proof'' required to assure women that they can remain healthy
without hormones will be forthcoming.
''Because we have no large-scale, unbiased medical research studies on
healthy women who do not take HRT, I cannot cite research to help women
make the choice to avoid or go on HRT. I have only the 'anecdotal'
experience of caring for the women in my practice who have decided to
avoid it with my support.''

Bruce McKain considers the motivation which drives an unusual band of
lawyers.
THE case of asthma victim Kenneth Gibson, forced to accept
compensation of just #2500 for the damage to his health caused by years
of working among flour dust, is typical of the crusading law firm which
acted for him.
Robin Thompson and Partners represented striking miners, often doing
themselves no favours with the legal establishment, and lobbied
successfully for more generous payments for the families of asbestosis
victims who were dying before their cases could get through the courts.
They played a crucial role in defeating the Home Secretary's plans for
a less-generous criminal injuries compensation scheme and have railed
against the Compensation Recovery Unit, which was set up to claw back
benefits from the victims of accidents and industrial disease, such as
Mr Gibson.
Like most lawyers, Frank Maguire, a partner in Robin Thompson's
Glasgow office, chooses his words carefully, but he is scathing about
the 1992 Social Security Act which introduced the CRU and which cost Mr
Gibson thousands of pounds.
''It is a disgusting piece of legislation. No credit is given to
either the victim or the employer for the number of years of payment to
national insurance contributions.
''It undermines the rights available to victims of injury and disease
and in many cases forces them into accepting paltry offers, or not
proceeding with a claim at all.''
Publicity is, of course, a double-edged sword and not all of the
recent headlines surrounding the firm have been welcome. Earlier this
year two of the firm's partners in Edinburgh were accused of a #2600
fraud based on allegations that they had overcharged other lawyers.
After a three-week trial, the charge was thrown out by the sheriff and
a statement issued on behalf of the partners was unapologetic and
combative. They said they were ''looking forward to renewing challenges
to Government policies which take away people's basic rights in the
field of employment and personal injuries.''
It was a statement of which the firm's legendary founder, William
Henry Thompson, would have warmly approved, but then WH was no ordinary
lawyer.
He refused to serve in the Great War and spent 18 months in various
jails as a conscientious objector until his release in April 1919.
When he began to run his own law practice in London he went into
partnership with another ''conchie'' and at first refused to employ
other lawyers because he was so suspicious of their middle-class
attitudes and values.
The business carried on by his sons Robin and Brian has mushroomed
into one of the country's most influential law practices, but WH's
legacy of Suffragettes and the first workmen's compensation cases
remains largely undiminished.
Robin Thompson now has offices in almost every major city from the
South of England right up to Edinburgh and Glasgow. Partners are in
regular contact, trying to take the law forward by exchanging
information about cases.
Frank Maguire is currently involved in a passive-smoking case against
an employer in Glasgow and is using information gleaned from a
successful Thompson case in Manchester.
''A great deal of our work is for trade unions, but as well as the
high-profile political stuff we also deal with the problems of members
who have been injured at work either through disease or an accident.
One of the issues he would like to see Scots law address is why a
child's death is worth so little.
''We seem to recognise that if somebody's character is defamed they
get a large amount of damages and if somebody's car is smashed up they
get the value of the car.
''We are very good at compensating for loss of property, but when it
comes to life and limb we don't seem to know how to put a value on that.
We go to one extreme and say because we can't put a value on it we'll
give no value to it or we'll give a token value to it because these
things are inestimable.
Frank Maguire does not claim that his firm is unique in its commitment
and attitude to clients, but says: ''We have a motivation and that's
what drives us. You go the extra mile, you put yourself out because you
see it as part of a general philosophy.
''At the same time you can't have a wonderful philosophy and be a
rotten lawyer. People employ you because you're a lawyer and you've got
to be as good a lawyer as you can be and give an efficient service. I
would like to think we do have respect within the profession for being
good lawyers and lawyers who have taken the law forward in a lot of
ways.''
It is an image which, with some reservations, seems to be shared by
rival lawyers who generally rate Thompson's highly as opponents.
''They are generally thorough, professional, well-prepared, and have
thought about the issues of fact and law in the case, which is not
something you could say for all firms acting for pursuers,'' one highly
experienced Court of Session said.
''Their weakness is that they sometimes become so committed to their
client's cause that they lose their objectivity. That is always the risk
in adopting the moral high ground -- you are always the good guys and
the defenders are the bad guys.''

By George Birrell who backs the vision of Redwood and Portillo.
IT was Lord Salisbury who shrewdly observed that it was impossible to
say how many people voted Conservative, not for love of Conservatism,
but for dislike of the other side. John Major is finding out. The
answer, in a consensus Britain, where a new orthodoxy has been
established with Tony Blair and where it is impossible to discern any
substantive difference in economic policy between the two, is damn few.
The result has been to plunge Conservatism into crisis.
The two pillars of modern Toryism are respect for traditional values,
and the approval of the free market. They stand sentinel over the
battlefield for the leadership of the party.
All sides pay homage to these symbols; only their perception differs.
This way lies confusion and disharmony.
The Majors, the Hurds, the Clarkes are the consolidators. They are the
natural heirs of what was once known as the ''stupid'' party,
pragmatists within a tradition historically shy of ideas. The Redwoods
and the Portillos are the radicals with a passion for Thatcherite icons
such as low taxation, sound money, individual responsibility -- combined
with veneration for Crown and Parliament. It is they who are
self-confident enough to engage the reinvigorated Labour Party in the
battle of ideas and redefine Conservative philosophy. The future lies
with them.
Major may well be the one to unite all wings of the party but only
because, politically, he is the lowest common denominator. He will put a
halt to further reforms in health and education, tinker with interest
rates to hold the pound steady and inflation down, and trim state
spending where possible. But this is the agenda of a middle-rank
manager, not a programme for a national political party.
It harks back to the managerial/technocratic approach of the sixties
and most of the seventies. Thatcher changed all that with her revolution
based on economic liberalism. Selsdon Man under Ted Heath was the father
of the idea; she nurtured it to adulthood. It was resonant of political
thought stretching back to Hume and Adam Smith and was distinguished
from continental philosophy by a sturdy individualism grounded in
absolute property rights.
This is the vision of which Portillo and Redwood are the heirs and
which creates the true blue stretch of water between an identifiable
Toryism and the New Model Labour Party.
Central to it is giving people the freedom to spend their own money.
The current spending cuts give the impression of Government stinginess
rather than prudence. For the middle classes the loss in mortgage tax
relief and child benefits can be compensated by significant direct tax
cuts. This is not just an economic good but a moral one because taking
money away and then handing it back is the state undermining the family.
They also revel in the unwritten constitution which by its very nature
is flexible and capable of adapting to changing circumstances, to the
New Right responding to the demands of devolution from the Scots, or to
a bill of rights, and is not precluded by a blinkered unionism. Variety
and individualism are paramount and Portillo, especially -- Portillo who
eagerly backed the non-privatisation of Scotland's water -- is receptive
to proposals for better government which is not the same as Labour's
present assembly plans.
This Conservatism is invigorating in the mould of Edmond Burke, the
father of Conservative thought with its reliance on the great
institutions that hold society together -- family, law, Parliament --
but fashioning them in a meritocratic way. The philosophy of Portillo
and Redwood is in keeping with the Thatcher revolution towards more
economic freedom and less government.
This does not rule out closer ties with Europe -- only an anathema to
creeping federalisation and common exchange rates which, they believe,
will lead to Britain losing its independence and the entrepreneurial
spirit which is the key to economic salvation.
Unlike many in the Cabinet they do not see a contradiction between
supporting the nation state and being good Europeans. One of the
prerequisites of a European market has to be that it is competitive
enough to meet the challenge of Asia, not hide behind a protectionist
wall.
It is in Europe that Portillo and Redwood see the tradition of Tory
free trade stretching back to Peel and his abolition of the corn laws,
and the battle at the beginning of this century against Joseph
Chamberlain who wanted his own common market and single currency in the
form of imperial preference.
The New Right, however, is not homogenous. Redwood is more futuristic,
an Internet politician readier to surf into the Promised Land. Portillo
has a greater sense of history and tradition. It may have to do with his
family background -- a Spanish father and Scots mother -- or more
probably the influence of one of the New Right's most influential
figures, the Cambridge historian Maurice Cowling.
Cowling, like Sir Keith Joseph, espoused a broader Toryism than the
mere pursuit of free markets. He also instilled in Portillo a sceptical
mind which warned of the dangers of ideology and the limits of theory.
Portillo nevertheless plays the ''British'' cards with vigour. He has
attacked the ''new British disease: the self-destructive sickness of
national cynicism, too many politicians, academics, churchmen, authors,
commentators, and journalists exhibit the full-blown symptoms'', he
said. ''We must temper our traditional tolerance when confronted by
those who stock in trade is to belittle and undermine the fabric of our
society. We are a proud nation and will not allow a small group of
pessimists to bring us down.''
This appeal to national greatness has always been a central tenet of
Conservatism. It is far removed from John Major's soft-focus vision of
cricket pitches with lengthening shadows and warm beer.
Yet allied to this is a pragmatism first articulated by Burke who said
that a wise Government was distinguished by knowing ''the best time and
manner of yielding what it is impossible to keep''. Portillo learned
this lesson early. He was champion of Mrs Thatcher's poll tax; he was
also its undertaker. In this he is a traditional Tory, more concerned
about preserving the continuity of the state than in the continuity of
policies.
What underscores Portillo's Conservatism and distinguishes it from
Labour is that he freely borrows from Tory intellectuals. From Michael
Oakeshott, the celebrated Conservative thinker, he supports humane
Conservatism which seeks to mitigate the worst of man's inhumanity to
man ''reconciling ourselves to circumstances not seeking to transform
them.''
Yet probably his most unifying belief, for those worried about the
lack of any consensus, is his reiteration of the Oxford don Dr John
Gray: ''It is inappropriate for Conservatives to be engaged in permanent
revolution. We are not Maoists.''

By R D Kernohan, who invokes the weight of Conservative tradition.
I'VE heard more about the soul in the past few days of politics than
in years of sermons. Westminster's Conservative spectacular of fractious
rebellion, pre-emptive strike, vaulting ambition, and repayment of old
scores is said to be a battle ''for the soul of the Tory Party''. One
BBC journalist even spoke of the soul of the right wing.
But the soul is notoriously difficult to define, in matters temporal
as well as spiritual. Nowhere more so than in the Conservative Party.
All politics are about power, office, influence, and survival as well
as ideas, but the Tory tradition is especially pragmatic. Political
Conservatism is not doctrinaire.
Its survival reflects its ability to adapt to social and economic
ideas, from Adam Smith by way of Shaftesbury and Keynes to Friedman and
Hayek. Its philosophy ought to be about the limitations of politics and
frailties of human nature, not the imposition of Utopia.
But Conservatism is an accumulation of experiences, ideas, and
instincts -- not least that instinct for survival which can turn so
savagely on a leader who outstays his welcome or her achievement. That
was so, long before Margaret Thatcher went the way of Edward Heath.
It's always hard to disentangle ideology or principle from the
personal or tactical in the interludes of turbulence which punctuate
Tory Party history. I heard John Redwood this week try to adapt a phrase
of Disraeli's. Looking up the original, I also encountered the ferocity
of the ambitious young Disraeli's onslaughts on Peel. The party of order
has always had spasms of disorder.
But ideology does sometimes intervene. The philosophical Arthur
Balfour was worn down over several years by divisions on tariff reform
and free trade akin to those on Europe which have so harassed John Major
since Maastricht. And, although the differences were often more over
pace and style than direction, Margaret Thatcher managed to harness
ideology to ambition when she overthrew Edward Heath -- the more obvious
line of succession having been broken by Iain Macleod's death and Keith
Joseph's clumsiness.
The Thatcher shadow still falls over the party which was possessed by
her. This influence is inevitable, because in a sense the present
turbulence is unfinished business arising from her fall. John Major had
(and still has) great gifts of courage and clarity, and except for his
realism on the poll tax did not obviously diverge, even on Europe, from
Thatcher policies. Yet he won because more Tories wanted to punish
Michael Heseltine than were ready to be grateful to him.
But the power of the Thatcher personality, and the love-or-loathe
reactions which she provokes, make it hard to assess both her place in
the Tory tradition and the condition in which she left the Conservative
soul. Her achievement and iniquities (more or less the same things seen
from different viewpoints) have obscured a clear view of three
limitations of ''the Thatcher revolution'' which achieved so much in
privatisation, tax cuts, trade union reform, home ownership, and the
eventual conversion of the Labour Party from socialism and
class-consciousness to realism and public relations.
The first limitation is that Thatcher Governments, like others, had to
compromise, even over Europe, and bend to pressures of expediency, as in
the ghastly Anglo-Irish agreement. Like every other Tory Premier
(probably any Premier) she had sometimes to take decisions at odds with
her party's emotions.
Secondly, like the subsequent Major administration and any likely
Labour one, the Thatcher Government had to struggle to contain the
ever-soaring costs of the welfare state. It envisaged gradual changes,
notably on pensions for an ageing population, but never risked radical
reform.
Thirdly, and most importantly, there was no British counter-revolution
in manners, morals, and tastes. Occasionally (as over abortion) this may
have reflected ''liberal'' opinions which Margaret Thatcher shared.
Sometimes it expressed a widly libertarian streak -- call it the Mellor
Tendency -- which began to appear in the more traditional Conservative
emphasis on individual freedom.
But most often it simply reflected the limitations of government in
any free society, especially one which is becoming culturally more and
more diverse. You cannot impose patriotism, family values, good taste,
or good English. And (as John Major discovered) you cannot even try to
go back to basics without confusion and embarrassment over public policy
and private behaviour.
This is the real difficulty today for the Tory tradition and
especially ''one-nation'' Conservatism, usually a frame of mind rather
than a set of policies. Baldwin, for all his indolence, assuaged the
bitterness of class war. Macmillan, poseur though he was, genuinely
cared about unemployment and even let his emotions cloud his judgment.
Iain Macleod (so admired by John Major) showed that in politics you can
hit hard without hatred or rancour.
A similar frame of mind in today's conditions is needed to ensure that
Conservative priorities are not set only by the Home Counties or even
''Middle England''. It needs to be sensitive as well as realistic in
dealing with those trapped in a dependency culture. It needs something
of the Heseltine foray into Toxteth in helping blighted communities.
But ''one-nation'' Conservatism has to address two even profounder
problems. One is the frame of mind as well as the framework of policy in
which Britain relates to continental Europe. The other is the extent,
limited though it may be, to which Government leadership and policy can
strengthen family life and encourage things which are true, honest,
just, pure, and of good report.
Europe, though it has given John Major so much difficulty, ought to be
the easier problem. Tory pragmatism must take account of the hazards of
trying to get out and the opportunity for influence within.
The tide of opinion on federalism, Commission bureaucracy, and
agricultural absurdities is in our favour. So too is the expansion of
the European Union -- and the self-evident survival of nationality in
France and everywhere else.
It will be harder, in John Major's neat but premature phrase, to help
Britain to be at ease with itself. For the fractiousness of the Tory
Party may mirror a fractious mood in the country, also reflected in what
Douglas Hurd recently called the ''culture of criticism'' in the media.
We may be a more classless society and we are certainly a much less
deferential one -- even in the Conservative Party, which no longer has a
Willie Whitelaw or Alec Douglas-Home available to moderate in a crisis
or become ''available'' as a last resort.
In such a situation the Tory Party ought still to be a voice of
reason, a factor for stability and a force for order, remembering Edmund
Burke's reflection that ''good order is the foundation of all good
things''.
For the past year or two, it has been none of these things and has had
a better Prime Minister and leader than, on recent form, it deserves. I
fervently hope it re-elects John Major. If not, the only hope for its
soul may be to turn to Michael Heseltine after all.

Frances Horsburgh reports how senior councillors in the new unitary
authorities can earn up to #24,000
WHEN she was leader of Glasgow District Council, Jean McFadden once
famously remarked that for running the city she was paid less per hour
than her office cleaner.
For years councillors have unsuccessfully pressed Tory and Labour
governments to do something about their levels of remuneration. Many
have argued for full-time salaries and claimed: ''If you pay peanuts you
get monkeys.''
Well, something has been done, and for some people at least local
government reorganisation has brought a bit of a bonanza. Now not even
the highest-paid cleaning lady could match the #24,000 a year Mrs
McFadden will receive next year for chairing the new single-tier City of
Glasgow Council.
Even the Labour leader of the smallest new unitary authority of
Clackmannanshire, Teresa McNally, will get a total of almost #17,000 a
year compared with the #3500 she got previously as deputy leader and
housing spokeswoman for Clackmannan District Council.
What has happened is that, courtesy of the Government, the Convention
of Scottish Local Authorities, and the council taxpayers' purse,
something approaching real salaries are being paid for the first time to
councillors in the top local authority jobs.
A big change in the fortunes of many senior councillors has been
effected almost by stealth, with neither the Government nor the Labour
Party ever declaring themselves in favour of full-time salaried
councillors.
For a start, the Tories' determination to move to a one-tier system of
local government meant the number of councillors was reduced by about a
third.
The old system of attendance allowances had already been abandoned
three years ago and replaced by a flat-rate yearly allowance.
Simply by maintaining the total #7m sum of money paid in consideration
of these flat-rate allowances the Scottish Office ensured there was more
cash available for basic payments.
For the new councils these range now, on a population basis, from
#5000 to #6000 a year.
Ministers also agreed that rates of travel and subsistence would in
future be aligned generally to rates paid to council officials for which
Cosla had been pressing.
The Government's crucial contribution to what has happened, however,
was in its agreement earlier this year ''to leave decisions on the
payment of special responsibility allowances (SRAs) at the discretion of
councils themselves who will have to balance their priorities and needs
in determining payments.''
This means the money to pay SRAs must be found from within the budget
provision of the new councils, which continues to be subject to capping.
It was agreed that guidance to councils on the level of SRAs would be
drawn up by Cosla.
Details of the Cosla scheme -- unanimously agreed by all political
parties on the convention and sent to councils -- states: ''Although the
Government maintains that these are allowances, not salaries, the
convention considers that the post of leader of a council is likely to
require a full-time commitment, indeed a commitment which will extend
well beyond a normal 35-40 hour working week.''
It suggests the range of skills required is comparable to such council
posts as a social worker, whose basic maximum grade pay is just over
#19,000, and a teacher, with a basic maximum of #20,190.
The scheme recommends an SRA of #18,000 for top posts in Glasgow,
which is the amount being paid to Councillor Jean McFadden and
Councillor Bob Gould, the leader of the Labour administration. Add to
this the basic allowance of #6000 and you reach the #24,000 total.
In Edinburgh, the leader of the new Labour-controlled city council,
Keith Geddes, will receive a total of #23,000, which includes an SRA of
#17,000.
Cosla recommends that councillors chairing important committees should
have SRAs at 75% of the leader's level, with posts of slightly lower
responsibility having an SRA at 50% of the leaders' level and so on.
What might raise an eyebrow among the public is the fact that in the
new Glasgow council, for example, Labour has managed to spread the SRAs
widely enough to ensure that 57 out of 77 of its members receive extra
payments tapering down to #2400 for vice-chairs of smaller committees.
One Tory activist told me that allowing Cosla to draw up a scheme for
paying responsibility allowances was like giving a blank cheque to the
Labour Party, and indeed most of those who benefit throughout Scotland
will be Labour councillors as they have won control of most of the
larger new councils. However, that is scarcely their fault!
But most Tory councillors are not opposed to the new level of payments
as such. In the new Glasgow Council opposition Tory group leader John
Young will get an SRA of #4500.
He said yesterday that the basic allowances were still lower than
those paid to many people who gave up far less time to serve on quangos
or other public bodies. Even with the special responsibility payments
they were still much lower than the sums paid to those serving in local
government in Europe or the US.
Councillors of all political shades point to the multi-million-pound
budget decisions they have to make and to the level of salaries paid to
council chief executives -- Bob Gould in Glasgow will still be getting
only about a quarter of what his top official is paid, and councillors
have no local authority pension entitlement.
At Clackmannan District Council, McNally said her new #17,000 post was
a full-time job in an authority which had only 12 members and was taking
on major new service responsibilites as a result of reorganisation.
But she went on: ''I did not come into local government to make money,
although it is nice to have the recognition of that extra
responsibility. I also recognise that there are a lot of people out
there on low wages struggling very hard.''
Cosla's Labour president, Councillor Rosemary McKenna, emphasised that
in the past many people had been discouraged from standing for election
because of the level of remuneration and the difficulty of getting time
off work.
She said the new flexibility over special responsibility payments
meant that for the first time there was an element of choice for people
entering local government. They could see it as a possible career
without the inevitability of having to juggle two jobs.
Over a period of 10 years in local government she herself had lost
five years of pension rights as a teacher because of the time she had to
take off for council business.
It is clear that now some councillors at least are receiving what
amounts to full-time salaries -- a bit like sportsmen turning
professional, they will have to perform well and maintain a high
standard of play to please the crowd.
The last word to Jean McFadden: ''The responsibilities of running the
new unitary authorities are enormous, and there is no apology needed for
this level of payment. It is up to us to prove we are worth it.''

Alison Daniels reports that civic apathy could thwart plans to erect a
statue of Bonnie Prince Charlie in Derby to commemorate the 250th
anniversary of the Jacobite retreat from the English town.
LIKE the event it is meant to commemorate, a plan to erect a
larger-than-life statue of Bonnie Prince Charlie in the centre of Derby
could be shortlived, defeated by civic apathy.
Yet with the 250th anniversary of the prince's retreat from the
English town only six months away, those behind the scheme are confident
-- in the face of unfavourable odds -- that the specially commissioned
statue will win hearts and stir latent Jacobite passions.
It is envisaged that the prince, astride a walking horse, will cut a
dash in the town centre, his profile facing south to the capital, the
nag's head, significantly, tilted north towards the Border.
Well, that is the idea. But the fate of the new prince rests with the
planning committee of Derby City Council. So far, it has refused to
grant planning permission. In an explanation the council's planning
director, Alan Aldread, says the people of Derby have only a tenuous
grasp of the events surrounding the Young Pretender's brief sortie into
Derby. ''I think opinion is 10 to one against the idea along the lines
of, 'the guy was here for five minutes and who was he anyway?'''
But as he reads through contemporary accounts of the prince's
occupation, the proprietor of the Derby Heritage Centre, historian,
Jacobite enthusiast, and would-be statue builder Richard Felix, remains
unabashed in the face of civic intransigence. He has, he says,
supporters, including the Derby and District Chamber of Trade, and local
entrepreneur and owner of Derby County Football Club, Lionel Pickering.
Pickering has already commissioned Oxford-based sculptor Anthony Stones.
If the councillors on the city's planning committee remain unimpressed
with the historical significance of the Young Pretender's fleeting
visit, Felix is keen to breathe life into history. He launches into a
narrative peppered with words such as ''epic'', ''incredible feat'', and
''momentous'' to describe what was, after all, the prince's furthest
foray south.
Charlie, he reminds us, arrived in Derby on December 4, 1745, with an
Army of 5000 Scottish and English troops en route to London and the
throne. ''He got within 120 miles of the capital; there was panic in the
streets of London. George III had his bags packed for Germany.''
The prince and his Army occupied the town for two nights and three
days before a fateful decision, taken in Exeter House, to turn back,
thus effectively ending the Jacobite cause. Had he not, sighs Felix,
no-one, including Derby councillors and antagonistic letter writers to
Derby's Evening Telegraph opposing the idea, would have had difficulty
recalling his name.
With hordes of 1990s Jacobite pretenders, draped in tartan and let
loose across Scotland and northern England in celebration of the
Jacobite Risings this year, Felix believes his proposed bronze statue
would be a fitting reminder of Derby's role. It will cost about #100,000
of which #20,000 has already been raised. Funds are being sought from
Scots at home and abroad as well as from local businesses.
Felix and his committee of fundraisers have their eye on a city-centre
site for the statue, currently being landscaped, and only a stone's
throw from Exeter House -- now a police station. Perhaps, he suggests,
the site known locally as ''the hole'' could be transformed into a
commemorative garden.
At a time when most public statues aspire to attention-grabbing
modernity, Bonnie Prince Charlie would be cast in a traditional
material, echoing the realistic style beloved of eighteenth and
nineteenth-century town planners.
Sculptor Anthony Stones has already created a quarter-scale model in
clay, based on a bronze bust of the prince by the French sculptor
Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, cast in 1746 and now in the Scottish National
Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. Once completed it will, he says, be the
only sculpture of the Young Pretender in the world. The figure on top of
the Glenfinnan memorial is, contrary to popular perception, a
Highlander.
''From my point of view it's a terribly exciting thing to be asked to
do. It's one of the greatest moments of history. I specialise in
realistic, commemorative work so it is in my line. I suppose my
philosophy about sculpture is that it should be evocative, not a
waxwork-like resemblance.''
Stones has until December 6 (the prince's last day in Derby) to
complete the statue -- money and planning approval permitted.

<HEADLINE>'Triple threat' to oil sector jobs</HEADLINE>

THE North-east of Scotland, dominated by the oil industry and with one
of the strongest economies in the UK, could face job losses in the next
five years, it was claimed last night.
Industry and business leaders were given this warning in Aberdeen when
the Royal Bank of Scotland and Grampian Enterprise presented a new
analysis, prepared by their economists, on the outlook facing the area.
Mr Mark Shea, energy economist at the Royal Bank, said employment in
the oil sector faced a triple threat from intense competitive pressure
to cut costs, the development of new production technologies, which had
lower manpower requirements, and the anticipated decline in oil output,
which could begin as soon as next year.
He believed oil prices would remain, in real terms, at the present
level for the rest of the decade and this would maintain the pressure on
oil companies to cut costs and result in greater contracting to firms
which offered lower costs. This could draw labour from throughout the
UK.
''As costs and manpower are reduced, the link between North Sea
production and economic activity will begin to break down,''said Mr
Shea. ''Thus, if prices continue to fall, in real terms, it will be
necessary to continue to cut costs and also to compensate for the
accompanying job losses.''
In preparing for this eventuality, the oil service industry in the
region faced two principal options. They were to export expertise in
existing oil and gas technologies to win business in overseas oil
provinces, where the market was still expanding, and to reposition
businesses to take advantage of growth opportunities outside the oil and
gas industry.
Mr Hance Fullerton, chief executive of Grampian Enterprise, said it
was commonly accepted there would be a 5% loss of jobs in the oil
industry per year and they did not see any other sector of the area's
economy coming forward strongly enough to replace that level of jobs.
As well as the oil industry, there could be job losses in agriculture,
construction, food processing, and mechanical engineering.
''If the Grampian economy, with its currently strong economic
performance, is to benefit further from the backcloth of continued UK
and Scottish growth, there are a series of sectoral challenges which
must now be addressed,'' said Mr Fullerton.
However, he added that the headline news for Grampian was good and the
current good health of the national economy gave the area the
opportunity to build on its strong base and develop strategic solutions
to some of the more crucial challenges ahead.
Mr Jeremy Peat, chief economist at the Royal Bank, said that while
there might be job losses in the short term, this was necessary to
provide a secure foundation for all sectors of the Grampian economy to
continue and to be successful.

<HEADLINE>Survey shows 64% of workers suffering.  Scots' stress levels 'higher than average'</HEADLINE>

STRESS in the workplace has reached epidemic proportions across the UK
and the problem in Scotland is higher than average, according to a
survey published today by the Manufacturing, Science, and Finance union.
The union blames the increase in occupational stress on growing
workloads borne by fewer people, harder sales targets,
performance-related pay, spiralling paperwork, fears about unemployment,
and ''increasingly vicious management techniques''.
It believes the rising level of stress is resulting in increased
absenteeism and reduced work performance. In Scotland, 64% of workers
were found to be suffering stress, compared to a UK average of 60%.
Mr Willie Gibson, MSF Scottish regional officer, yesterday urged
employers to adopt a new ethos towards the welfare of their employees.
''Organisations are paying a high price for the stress epidemic in our
workplaces,'' he said. ''Employers should realise stress is bad for
employees and bad for business. They should act quickly to ensure they
are dealing with the causes and not the symptoms.
''The focus on stress must be shifted away from the sick individual
and on to the sick organisation. Employers have a clear duty to tackle
stress and we will be ensuring it is a number one priority for health
and safety negotiators throughout the country.''
The main causes of stress identified by MSF members were: insufficient
time to do the job; poor relationships with bosses; little or no
involvement in decision making; and lack of control over the job.
The most common symptoms were irritability, tiredness, inability to
sleep, and headaches.
The MSF survey covered 412 private and public sector workplaces
employing 140,000 workers throughout the UK. Slightly more than half
were from manufacturing, the rest from the service sector.
It found that stress levels were higher than average in health,
financial services, education, and voluntary groups.
Across the UK, 39% of people were dissatisfied in their present jobs,
and 71% said stress levels were higher than five years ago.
A regional breakdown of the results suggests that Northern Ireland has
the highest proportion of workers suffering stress, 88%, while the
South-east of England has the lowest rate, 42%.
MSF has published a Preventing Stress At Work guide which is being
sent to all the union's health and safety representatives. They are
being encouraged to raise the issue with their employers.
The union says the problem is an organisational one rather than the
result of individual weakness and is asking employers to identify causes
and make changes in areas such as job design, workplace layout, and the
way work is managed and arranged.
It also says, although current health and safety legislation obliges
employers to counter stress, the Government should introduce a law
making this commitment explicit.
Mr Gibson said: ''We are trying to raise awareness about this
unacceptable workplace illness. We believe many employers are ignoring
the severity of the problem.''
He added: ''If employers ignore the warnings, the union will be
supporting members, whether that be at industrial tribunals for
constructive dismissal claims or in civil courts for compensation
claims.''
He gave examples of the union's involvement in stress-related cases,
including:
* A worker in the electronics industry developed Myalgic
Encephalomyelitis as a result of stress arising from ''an inordinate
workload'' and the union was called upon to negotiate early retirement;
* A group of employees at an NHS hospital trust in Fife complained
about stress resulting from ''insufficient staffing levels'' and the
union persuaded trust managers to recruit an extra three staff.

A RESCUE plan was launched yesterday for family doctors buckling under
the pressure of overwork.
The move follows a Royal College of General Practitioners conference
on stress in May which noted that round-the-clock call-outs, taking on
managerial responsibilities, and having to treat patients formerly seen
by other health- care professionals have taken their toll.
The new measures will include setting up an information database of
good practises, organising courses on managing stress and producing
educational videos, liaising with the Health Department, medical
committees and other groups, and introducing stress management at
medical schools.

A LEADING Scottish Conservative yesterday criticised the Government
for cutting financial aid to job-training agencies for disadvantaged
people.
Mr Bill Hughes, president of Work Wise Ltd, which trains the socially
deprived to obtain job qualifications, said a 17% cut in Government
funding since 1990 had left the disadvantaged without proper means to
finance training.
He added that only generous contributions by the Scottish business
community had allowed his own charity to pursue its remit.
Mr Hughes, the treasurer and former deputy chairman of the Scottish
Conservative Party, told the Work Wise AGM in Glasgow yesterday: ''The
least able in Scottish society are in danger of losing out as Government
support for special training needs is cut. These are people, left aside
by circumstances, who can make a real contribution to society.
''The Government must be more supportive of innovation in the special
training needs field, realising that this may require more flexible
funding than is often the case.''
Work Wise trained 200 people last year, including single mothers and
youngsters with drug or literacy problems, of whom 60% found full-time
work.
The charity recently received #51,000 from Levi Strauss, ScotRail, and
Whitbread to fund the development of a training centre in Drumchapel.

<TEXT>
AN increasing number of men are claiming they are being sexually
discriminated against in their quest for jobs, it was claimed yesterday.
The Equal Opportunities Commission, traditionally viewed as the
champion of women's rights, found that one quarter of the complaints it
received in Scotland last year were from disaffected men.
It claimed that figure will rise this year as more men lower their
sights in the job market.
Speaking at the launch of the EOC's annual report in Aberdeen,
Scottish director Morag Alexander said the majority of claims related to
access to jobs.
''Men are beginning to go for jobs that they did not apply for in the
past,'' she said.
''These are for mainly part-time jobs and because they have been out
of work for so long.
''They are finding out they are coming up against attitude barriers
and they are getting knocked back,'' she added.
Men bring fewer cases of sexual discrimination than women, although Ms
Alexander highlighted the case of one Aberdeen restaurant owner who was
prepared to employ only female waiting staff.
''Women are more likely to complain about sexual harassment and issues
related to pregnancy and maternity than access to jobs,'' said Dr Joan
Stringer, recently appointed commissioner of the EOC.
''We are an equal treatment organisation offering equal treatment for
women and men.
''We focus much more on women because they are much more likely to be
discriminated against than men.
''But we defend actions relating to men with the same vigour as we do
those of women,'' she added.
In the coming year, the organisation in Scotland intended to focus
more on initiatives outside the central belt.
''We intend to raise awareness of individual rights and look at
training and education opportunities,'' said Dr Stringer.
The organisation also has found the pay differential between men and
women is greater in Grampian than other areas of Scotland.
Dr Stringer pointed out that the gap in the Aberdeen area runs at 40%
compared with 30% in the rest of the country.
It attributes this to the oil industry conflicting with traditional
women's jobs in the fishing and rural sectors.
The EOC is concentrating its efforts on encouraging good practice
among employers rather than taking confrontational actions against them,
Dr Stringer added.

THE timetable for a privatised ScotRail still has May next year as its
target, the director of passenger rail franchising insisted yesterday.
However, Mr Roger Salmon's commitment to ScotRail's inclusion in the
51% of UK train operating units for privatisation by then was
''ludicrous'', according to Mr Henry McLeish, Labour's transport
spokesman.
The MP was adamant that the privatisation timetable remains in
''disarray'', regardless of his meeting with Mr Salmon in London,
yesterday.
Mr McLeish also claimed that the franchising office was ''in a
shambles'' over the detail of its proposed cuts in levels of subsidy to
operators who run trains in Scotland and elsewhere.
He warned that the public and political furore over the threatened
Fort William sleeper service must not detract from campaigns to preserve
other services within the Scottish network.
The sleeper, whose losses are put at #2.5m a year, was excluded from
Mr Salmon's recent draft Passenger Service Requirement (PSR) for
ScotRail, and scheduled for closure last month.
Two subsequent court rulings reprieved the service until Mr Salmon
makes up his mind about the minimum PSR after a public consultation
exercise.
ScotRail then warned that services will be cut elsewhere if it is
obliged to run the sleeper without grants.
The British Railways Board has agreed that the sleeper will continue
to run until September 22, and also agreed to pick up losses over the
four-month period.

THE Prince of Wales yesterday said goodbye to the man who has guarded
him and other members of the royal family on their visits to the
Highlands over the past eight years.
Detective Sergeant Archibald Campbell has kept a watchful eye over VIP
visitors in the Northern Constabulary area since 1987. As the prince
came to the end of his visit to Inverness, he surprised Mr Campbell by
coming over to wish him well in his retirement.
Mr Campbell, 50, said: ''He asked me if I intended to spend a bit more
time in the garden and shook my hand. I feel quite honoured.''
He retires at the end of August after 32 years' service.
Earlier, a kilted prince was greeted by glorious sunshine and hundreds
of cheering schoolchildren when he touched down in Inverness by
helicopter.
He inquired among some of the youngsters if they had brought
sandwiches for the lunchtime visit and, on being told most of them would
be returning for school dinners, said: ''I suppose it will be chips
again, then.''
The visit, in the 250th anniversary year of the 1745 Jacobite
uprising, confused one small boy, who shouted: ''Is it Bonnie Prince
Charlie who's coming?''
The very hot weather proved almost too much for the prince, who has
plenty experience of tours in the Tropics. He raised a sympathetic cheer
from fellow diners sweltering in a marquee in the grounds of Eden Court
Theatre in Inverness when he told them that it was ''one of the hottest
tent lunches of my life''.
The prince presented the Highlands and Islands Business Awards. The
award for the business of the year went to Sir Patrick Grant, chairman
of Grants of Dalvey.
The company, headed by the Highland clan chieftain, is based in
Alness, Easter Ross. It manufactures a range of highly specialised
stainless steel gift products.
Sir Patrick's firm was praised for its high-quality products and for
enhancing the reputation of the Highlands in the 42 countries it exports
to.
The smaller business award went to ATC Cosmetics of Invergordon,
Easter Ross, which makes nail varnish for companies which include
Yardley, Revlon, and Avon.
The most promising newcomer was named as Nairn Bike Colours. Its
founder, Mr John Curran, customises motor bikes and helmets.
The prince also presented a #1000 special award to two men who set up
a business in 1992 with help from the Prince's Scottish Youth Business
Trust.
Mr Chris Cairns and Mr Boyd Henderson set up Conserve, environmental
contractors, in Grantown-on-Spey and received a #3000 expansion loan
from the trust in 1994.
The Prince of Wales is president of the trust which he set up in 1989
to help young people start their own businesses.
Conserve, which employs 10 people, is involved in hill path
management, erosion control, surveying, and consultancy.
The youth business trust has spent #8m helping to start 2716
businesses throughout the UK, involving more than 3323 people aged
between 18 and 25.

THE arts in Scotland are significantly out-performing the rest of the
UK, according to a five-year study published today.
Cultural Trends in Scotland 1995, a survey by one of Europe's largest
independent researchers, the Policy Studies Institute, suggests that
Scots spend considerably more money on attending and supporting the arts
than the English.
The report says that Scotland has more than 1700 arts venues and that
Scottish theatre is attended by a quarter of all adults every year.
Total theatre performances have dropped across the UK since 1990 but
those in Scotland have declined at only half the national rate.
Museums and galleries also do better than the rest of Britain, with
three in five Scots attending each year.
Scotland has one bookshop for every 20,000 people, and 35% more is
spent on libraries per capita than the UK average.
However, the report suggests vast regional differences in the levels
of arts funding in Scotland. Local authority arts expenditure per capita
in Lothian is six times that of Dumfries and Galloway, with Tayside top
for literature and the Borders highest in terms of venue provision for
performing arts.
Local authorities remain by far suppliers of the highest funding of
arts in the country, although central government support to the Scottish
Arts Council increased by a quarter over the last decade.
Ms Christine Hamilton, director of planning and development at the
SAC, welcomed the figures and said they were evidence of ''the
tremendous resource'' of public support and facilities for the arts in
the country.
However, she added: ''Everything in the garden is not rosy as there
are still grave financial difficulties for individual artists trying to
survive in Scotland.''
Waterstone's in Glasgow confirmed that book sales went consistently
over budget in Scotland, while in the rest of the UK turnover was
patchy. Ms Belinda MacDougall, assistant manager of the Princes' Square
branch, said interest in Scottish writers was at a high and added: ''It
has also become very trendy for the big English publishers to 'sign'
Scots authors to their lists, because of the success of people like
James Kelman and Irving Welsh.''
Scotland was also found to have one of the highest UK employment rates
for craft workers and to have witnessed a significant growth in
traditional arts festivals such as the Gaelic music feisean over the
past decade.
Despite the recent spate of films made and set in Scotland, such as
Shallow Grave and Rob Roy, film attendances remained the only area
lagging behind the UK average, and jobs in the film industy declined by
a third in the four years to 1991.
According to the study, 93% of Scots felt the arts gave them a lot of
pleasure and 87% thought the nation's cultural activity conveyed a
positive image of Scotland to the rest of the world.

<RECORDNO>977649869</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NEW midge repellant made from sweet gale could provide a jobs boost
for Skye.
The cream, made from oils extracted from the plant, is to undergo
marketing trials throughout the north of Scotland this summer.
Five thousand tubes of the Callanish Myrica, which costs #4.99, went
on sale this month.
Dr Iain Cloughley, technical director at the Efamol Research Institute
which developed the cream, explained that the formula took four years
and #250,000 to develop.
The cream gives off a smell which, it is claimed, repels even the most
bloodthirsty midge.
Efamol has already set up a factory to make the cream at Armadale on
Skye.
However, if the results of the summer trials are good, the repellant
could be manufactured on a much larger scale with more workers being
hired.
Efamol is also planning to develop a whole range of insect repellants
based on sweet gale and other plants.
Dr Cloughley said: ''We already employ five people at Armadale, as
well as casual labourers to pick the leaves of the plant, but we're
hoping that will rise if the cream does well.''
He added: ''So far, our tests show that nine out of 10 people have
complete protection, which means no midge bites.
''Fortunately, the smell is not so repellent to humans -- sweet gale
usually gives off a sweet, slightly medicinal odour.
''The crofters used to put sweet gale in the straw beds they slept on
to ward of biting insects.''

A TEENAGE mother armed with a nail file who tried to rob two shops was
given two years' probation at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday.
Judge Lord Morison heard that Henrietta Johnstone, 19, was deeply in
debt and faced threats for repayment from loan sharks.
The court was told that in her desperation to repay the money which
she owed, she had gone into a greetings-card shop in Sauchiehall Street,
Glasgow, and, when the woman shop assistant opened the till, she had
lunged forward threatening her with a nail file and demanding money from
the till.
However, the assistant screamed and slammed the till drawer shut and
Johnstone ran from the shop without any money.
Later on the same day, Johnstone had gone into a jeweller's shop on
Argyle Street and again when an assistant opened the till she had lunged
at her with the nail file, demanding money. This time she grabbed #244
from the till and ran out of the shop.
However, Johnstone tripped over a child outside the shop and was
apprehended by a passer-by. She was brought back into the shop and threw
the money on the counter, saying: ''I needed the money''.
Mr Colin Boyd, QC, prosecuting told the court when Johnstone was
charged with the offence she told police: ''I was desperate for money''.
Miss Margaret Scott, defending, said Johnstone was a first offender
who had gone ''off the rails'' and one who had left home after becoming
involved with a man with a drug habit. The couple were in debt to loan
sharks and Johnstone had an 18-month-old child to support.
She said Johnstone had no intention of injuring anyone in the shops.
When she was caught she told police: ''I am sorry for what I have done,
I regret it, I feel guilty, I feel terrible.''
Since her arrest, Johnstone's relationship with her boyfriend had
broken up and she has become reconciled with her family.
Johnstone, of Charles Street, Royston, Glasgow, admitted assault and
attempted robbery of a quantity of money at two Glasgow shops on August
24 last year.
Passing sentence, Lord Morison told her he was not going to impose a
custodial sentence. However, he warned her: ''Cases of this serious
nature would normally result in a substantial custodial sentence''.
Lord Morison said he would give her a chance and instead of
imprisoning her, he would impose an order to carry out 200-hours'
community service during a two-year probation period.
The judge said he accepted that she was acting under the influence of
the man she lived with. He added that he had taken into account the fact
that Johnstone was a first offender and had expressed genuine regret for
the offences.
He said he also noted that she no longer had broken off the
relationship with her boyfriend.
Johnstone was warned to be of good behaviour or face a return to
court, and the likelihood of a custodial sentence being imposed.

Portland, Wednesday,
JURY selection is under way in the case of two British former leaders
of the Rajneesh cult who are accused of plotting to murder Oregon's top
federal prosecutor.
Sally-Anne Croft and Susan Hagan were extradited to the United States
earlier this year to stand trial on charges of conspiracy to murder then
US Attorney Charles Turner in 1985 when he was investigating immigration
fraud at a commune established by Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh on
an Oregon cattle ranch.
The alleged plot was never carried out.
The two women have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which their
lawyers say are based on the claims of other conspirators who received
either immunity from prosecution or lenient prison sentences.
The pair were returned to the United States earlier this year after
losing a five-year battle to block extradition.
Croft, 45, she served as Rajneesh's chief financial adviser in the
1980s. Hagan, 48, was president of the Rajneesh Investment Corporation.
The commune disbanded in 1985 after Rajneesh pleaded guilty to
immigration fraud. He paid a fine, gave up his fleet of 93 Rolls-Royces,
and moved back to Poona, where he died in 1990.--Reuter.

THE Nato allies were close last night to approving a plan for the
withdrawal of all or part of the 22,500-strong United Nations
peacekeeping force in Bosnia this autumn.
However an international row is brewing about the command and timing
of the operation, fuelled by French mistrust of the United States and
confusion over the UN's reluctance to give its peacekeepers the
necessary firepower and rights to protect themselves.
Up to 60,000 Allied troops from bases in Germany, France, and the UK
will be deployed to cover the retreat of units stranded deep in the
mountains of central Bosnia before winter traps them there and leaves
them at the mercy of surrounding Serbs.
As revealed in the Herald on Monday, the British and French have
already agreed a contingency plan to pull out their troops, the two
largest contingents in the country.
Government go-ahead for the extraction of up to 10,000 British
servicemen is expected within the next few weeks. Senior military
advisers have told the Cabinet that time is running short for a
successful withdrawal this year.
Key staff officers with expertise in intelligence, logistics, and
planning have already been placed quietly on alert to cope with the
immense task of masterminding what could become a fighting retreat down
a handful of mountain roads to the Croatian coast.
Britain has about 2800 troops in Bosnia, with a further 6500 either en
route or earmarked for despatch within days as part of a new Allied
rapid reaction force. These men are armed and equipped to protect the
isolated garisons and their vehicles as they fall back towards safety.
The force includes armoured engineers with vehicles designed for rapid
mine-clearance and bridge and road repairs, air-portable light
artillery, two battalions of mobile infantry, and up to 80 transport and
attack helicopters.
Nato ambassadors are expected to give provisional approval to a wider
plan later this week, with the official line that it will be implemented
only if the UN requests Alliance help.
Unofficially, a row is already developing about who will command the
operation. The French have said they will not serve under a US leader,
but Nato insists that it must have overall control if it is asked to
intervene effectively on a rescue mission.
The diplomatic confusion and tangled chains of command are the main
reason Britain and France have set their own agenda. UN policy on rules
of engagement -- the right to shoot back in self-defence -- have been a
bone of contention for international peacekeepers throughout the
38-month conflict.
Intelligence predictions indicate that the Bosnian Muslims and Croats
will renew their bids to break Serbian control of strategic roads and
raise the siege of Sarajevo this summer.
All sides are now gearing for a struggle to gain the upper hand before
winter limits movement on the ground. UN forces are caught in the
middle, and unable to intervene or guarantee humanitarian aid to the
civilian populations of disputed areas.
The new international negotiator for the area, former Swedish premier
Carl Bildt, warned last night that a pull-out of peacekeepers could lead
to a humanitarian disaster and spread the war beyond Bosnia.
Earlier this week, Mr Bildt said the UN might be forced, reluctantly,
to withdraw if the protagonists prevented them from performing their
mission, or presented them with unacceptable risks to peacekeeping
troops.
Meanwhile, a BBC TV crew covering the war in Bosnia escaped injury by
moments yesterday when Sarajevo's television centre came under fire.
The team, which included reporter Jeremy Bowen, had filed satellite
reports via the European Broadcasting Union facility in the building
shortly before a modified anti-aircraft rocket and a mortar struck.
The TV centre has been a regular target for Bosnian Serb gunners
laying siege to Sarajevo for three years but its thick walls have
withstood most previous attacks unscathed.
Five people died in the rocket attacks and three others in shelling
elsewhere in the Bosnian capital.
UN peacekeepers said the makeshift rockets, carrying warheads weighing
hundreds of pounds, were ''rudimentary, inaccurate, and
indiscriminate'', but they dealt huge damage to their targets.
A police guard died and Bosnian and foreign journalists were among 38
people wounded by the blast, which destroyed three floors at the
fortress-like television centre.
Four people were killed minutes later when a second rocket turned
flats to rubble on upper storeys of a nearby high-rise tower.

Beirut, Wednesday,
SECURITY forces seeking the body of British journalist Alec Collett,
kidnapped in Lebanon in the 1980s, revealed that they dug up a site in
the eastern Bekaa Valley last week.
''They dug an empty hole and came back. Nothing was found,'' a source
said, adding that another attempt would be made.
Collett, a retired journalist working as a contract writer for the UN
Relief and Works Agency, which cares for Palestinian refugees, was
snatched on March 25, 1985, in west Beirut during a wave of kidnappings
of Westerners.
A UN mission visited Lebanon two weeks ago and was assured of help
from the Lebanese authorities in uncovering his fate and that of three
other missing UN employees.
Mr Collett is believed to have been executed by his captors in 1986.
The source said a team from Lebanon's security forces with
representatives of the British embassy and a UN doctor went to the Bekaa
valley last Friday after receiving a tip-off.
''They met Syrian officers and Palestinians and they dug for a long
time and came back empty-handed,'' the source said.--Reuter.

Karachi, Wednesday,
PAKISTANI authorities have asked Interpol to arrest Pakistan's exiled
Mohajir National Movement (MQM) leader Altaf Hussain, who is living in
self-imposed exile in Britain.
Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar told reporters that Islamabad had
asked Interpol for the immediate arrest of Hussain so that he could face
criminal charges in Pakistan.
Hussain is accused by the authoritities of inciting his followers to
violence in the southern port city of Karachi. is based.
Babar said the Foreign Ministry would take up the matter with the
British Government.
Six people, including a policeman, were killed in Karachi today,
pushing this month's death toll close to 300. A three-day strike called
by the MQM raised the toll.
A spokesman for the MQM said the organisation was considering how to
respond to a government move apparently aimed at resuming peace talks.
Hussain, who has been in London for three years, is seeking political
asylum in Britain, with which Pakistan has no extradition
treaty.--Reuter.

Berlin, Wednesday
POLICE were bemused and embarrassed today after four armed bank
robbers gave them the slip by tunnelling through a cordon and getting
away with #2.4m in loot.
The four robbers literally walked out under the feet of hundreds of
police bristling with heavy weaponry, armoured cars, and night-vision
equipment to a getaway car parked outside the cordon, 100yd from the
bank.
Police laid siege to the bank for 17 hours believing the robbers armed
with machine guns were threatening the lives of 16 customers and staff
to back their demands for #8m, a getaway car, and a helicopter.
However it was a 3am telephone call from one of the hostages which
told police that the robbers -- who had last spoken to them two hours
earlier -- appeared to have left.
When a crack unit stormed the building 45 minutes later, their only
task was to free the hostages unharmed and establish that the robbers
had never meant to use a car or helicopter but had escaped in classic
fashion -- through a tunnel. In fact two, totalling 230ft in length.
''The deed does demonstrate a certain dash and a certain degree of
skill,'' said sheepish police chief Hagen Saberschinsky.
''The robbers were very well prepared, well organised, and well
disciplined,'' he said.
He said police still had no clue to the identities of the men, who
were masked and put shopping bags over their hostages' heads.
His embarrassment was compounded by the fact that police officers clad
only in swimming trunks had, on the gangsters' instructions, brought
five bags to the bank containing #480,000 each as a down-payment on the
ransom.
The money, and still-to-be valued jewellery and cash from safes and
safety deposit boxes, vanished into thin air along with the
thieves.--Reuter.

Cairo, Wednesday,
A YOUNG British diving instructor has died and another Briton is
missing after an accident off the resort town of Dahab on the Red Sea, a
spokesman for the British Embassy in Cairo said tonight.
Lisa Thomson, believed to be in her twenties, was found on Sunday.
David Bruce Warner was said to be missing, presumed dead.
Two Germans are also missing, presumed dead.
The embassy spokesman said it was understood there had been a diving
accident but no other details were available.
A Foreign office spokesman said the Egyptians had called off the
search for the missing divers two days ago because conditions were
dangerous.
''We are trying to get the Egyptians to resume their search,'' added
the spokesman.
He said Ms Thomson's body had been recovered from ''some depth'' in
the Red Sea by Israeli divers.
Next of kin had been informed, he added, and they were making
arrangements for Ms Thomson's body to be flown home.

Kyrenia, Wednesday,
A HUGE forest fire raging through northern Cyprus today swept past the
holiday town of Kyrenia, destroying houses on the outskirts but leaving
most of the town intact.
Nine people, including two firefighters, were injured after the blaze
ravaged an area of about 27 sq miles.
The flames destroyed at least 14 villages, said Turkish Cypriot
television.
A strong sea wind blew flames eastward past Kyrenia, a picturesque
harbour town on the northern coast of the Mediterranean island, burning
down at east two villas and a vineyard.
''It's bloody awful,'' said Sylvia Ridley-Dash, an elderly British
resident of northern Cyprus, whose two houses on the outskirts of
Kyrenia narrowly escaped destruction.
''We were a bit scared,'' she added, saying she had evacuated with her
son his wife, and her two cats to stay the night in safety across the
mountains in Nicosia.
Two helicopters from a British military base in Cyprus scooped water
from the Mediterranean and dumped it on the flames.
However Army spokesman Tony Worner said the Wessex helicopters sent at
first light returned to base this evening as they could not be operated
at night.
The inferno, which started in a forest last night, also skirted a
Crusader castle and a 12th century Gothic monastery near Kyrenia.
Firefighters from the rival Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities,
divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion, have joined forces to fight the
blaze.
The Greek Cypriots were with firefighters from the British base, and
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides on Wednesday criticised authorities in
the north for refusing offers of help.
''This is a big disaster. Our country is on fire,'' Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash said after he went to inspect fire-fighting
efforts.
Explosions, believed to come from bombs, shells, and mines left
scattered in the forest from the 1974 conflict, could be heard
throughout the night.
Strong winds fanned the blaze all today, taking it dangerously close
to the Saint Hilarion Crusader castle and the Gothic 12th century
Bellapais monastery.
Saint Hilarion, built by the Lusignan conquerors of Cyprus in 1288 and
named after a Syrian hermit, overlooks a pass through the Kyrenia
mountain range, while the ruined abbey of Bellapais is among the most
picturesque spots on the island.
Turkish Cypriot authorities closed the Nicosia-Kyrenia road.
The British bases deployed two helicopters, four fire engines, and 30
firemen, among whom were Greek Cypriots who had not been to the north
since 1974.
Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Hakki Atun acknowledged that the tiny
breakway northern state was not prepared for the fire.
''An inquiry will tell if we were late and what the reason for the
fire was but in any event we have to admit we weren't ready,'' he said.
Cyprus fire brigade spokesman Stelios Ioannou said they had
immediately offered their services to the Turkish Cypriots to contain
the fire when it broke out last night.
''They did not bother to even respond,'' he said. ''If we had been
called in, the fire would have been contained by now.''--Reuter.

Madrid, Wednesday
SPANISH Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez today accepted the resignations
of two colleagues, both victims of a bugging scandal.
Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra and Defence Minister Julian Garcia
Vargas are two of Gonzalez's longest-serving government colleagues and
the most senior to quit in a three-year wave of scandals.
The two had offered their resignations two weeks ago, after newspaper
revelations that the military intelligence unit Cesid had bugged leading
Spanish personalities including King Juan Carlos.
Socialist party parliamentary leader Joaquin Almunia told a news
conference that the resignations reflected the ministers' acceptance of
political responsibility, not of any guilt.
Opposition reaction to the announcement, which came on the eve of
Gonzalez's scheduled appearance in a parliamentary debate on the Cesid
scandal tomorrow, was fiercely critical.
''This is just a manoeuvre to distract attention and avoid his own
direct responsibilities in the Cesid affair,'' said Popular Party MP
Loyola de Palacios.
The scandal is deeply embarrassing to Gonzalez as Spain takes over the
EU presidency on Saturday.--Reuter.

The FBI confirmed the authenticity of a letter sent to a San Francisco

Geoffrey Parkhouse, Political Editor, describes a change in mood which
may benefit John Major.
THERE was a distinct taste of flat champagne about the Redwood
campaign yesterday. It lacks the essential momentum to survive. It
chunters on surviving on whispers.
However, these whispers are about Michael Portillo and Michael
Heseltine and how on earth they can get involved in the battle for the
leadership in their own cause. The Redwood rag-taggle of upfront
supporters are looking a bit desperate. It is galling for them to find
that he is, after all, a mere stalking horse and not the serious
candidate of Cabinet rank.
Unless Mr Redwood is able to rustle up a dozen serious Tory names
willing to commit themselves publicly in the next 24 hours, his bid for
the leadership looks like fizzling out.
One of his people, who has not put himself in front of the cameras,
but works for him nonetheless, told me yesterday: ''I wake up in the
night thinking that Redwood's campaign is ending. We don't seem to be
able to get the serious names to give him some substantial backing.''
This same chap on Tuesday estimated that when it comes to the vote
next Tuesday, Mr Redwood might get 50 supporters, with another 50 or so
abstentions. Yesterday, his calculations had changed. They are now
looking at 20 or 30 supporters and only 20 or 30 abstentions. Once this
gets around the corridors and bars, waverers might think that it is
pointless to stick their necks out for him.
The mood seems to have swung in the course of the last 24 hours. More
credence was being given yesterday to the confident prediction from the
Major camp that the Prime Minister will not only win on Tuesday, but win
well. They're looking at a 2-1 majority. In the short history of Tory
leadership, elections no winner has done much better than that.
This feeling appeared to be reflected in a lacklustre performance by
Mr Redwood at his news conference yesterday. A touch of wildness
appeared in his statements.
If elected, he would not wait until a November Budget to cut taxes.
His first Cabinet meeting ''must get to grips immediately with spending
and must offer something immediately on tax.'' This would be a one-off
exercise, with more to follow.
At the same time, he promised no cutbacks in frontline health and
education services. ''As Prime Minister, I will lead from the front and
expenditure will be reduced at the first Cabinet.'' This left MPs
wondering what kind of magic wand Mr Redwood has, not available to the
Cabinet he has just quit.
So the murmurings and the whisperings about Mr Heseltine and Mr
Portillo as later-stage candidates increase. However, no-one can state
how such a contest between these two -- a true battle for the soul of
the Tory Party -- can be brought about. So people are beginning to
suggest that if it can't happen next month, it is bound to come later in
the year.
''Portillo will be Prime Minister by Christmas,'' one hears. ''When
the time comes, Hezza will romp it, because the right will be split'' is
another forecast that in the light of the increasing confidence of the
Major camp seems fanciful.
Yesterday, if the argument had been about Europe alone, the Prime
Minister, making his statement to the Commons after the Cannes summit,
would win hands-down. He delivered a teach-in about his
keep-all-our-options-open policy which nobody was able to destroy.
However, the argument is not just about Europe, it is about hanging on
to power, or at least not losing it in a Labour landslide. Now Mr Major
is going to speak to as many of the 328 other Tory MPs as he can before
next Tuesday.
The supporters of Mr Portillo -- who Mr Major claimed yesterday is
backing him -- can only watch this helplessly because their man has
chosen not to engage in the contest. Much the same applies to Mr
Heseltine who is going about cautiously defending the Prime Minister. He
is determined this time that no taint of treachery will be laid upon
him.
However, whispering is a potent weapon in a secret ballot vote.
Anybody can swear undying loyalty to Mr Major, to his face or otherwise,
but still vote for another or abstain. A second ballot is still
possible, but then, if the Prime Minister insists on staying in the
fight the dilemmas of Mr Portillo and Mr Heseltine will have to be
faced.

Benedict Brogan, Political Reporter, reports on how the leadership
challenger's bandwagon has slowed.
JOHN REDWOOD yesterday tried to shore up his stalling campaign to
unseat Mr John Major with a promise of summer tax cuts funded by an
immediate #5bn reduction in public spending.
The former Welsh Secretary said all that was required was ''political
will'', something he was prepared to impose on his ministerial
colleagues. The first meeting of a Redwood Cabinet would have to agree
on savings worth 1.67% of Government expenditure.
Mr Redwood used what has become his daily news conference at
Westminster to set out his right-wing alternative to Majorism. ''There
must be an immediate one-off exercise to cut costs and to give something
back to the people. That is something they deserve and expect,'' he
said.
He criticised Labour's proposals for devolution in Scotland and Wales
as a high-priced attempt to create more bureaucracy. Reinforcing the
staunchly Unionist theme that has marked his campaign, he said: ''They
would end up spending a fortune on the very things I'm attacking.''
Mr Redwood cited management waste, excessive use of consultants, and
inefficient spending as areas for savings. However, his proposals were
immediately dismissed as economically simplistic and unworkable by
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke.
Following the publication of a gloomy Treasury economic forecast,
which shows the Government will have to borrow #3bn more than expected
this year to compensate for slower than expected growth, Mr Clarke
accused his former colleague of ''plucking figures out of the air''.
However, Mr Redwood claimed no business would have difficulty finding
savings of 1.67%, and neither should the Government. He did not detail
what would be cut, and suggested health and education would be
safeguarded. However, the Civil Service could face a recruitment freeze.
His supporters were joined at yesterday's appearance by the prominent
Euro-sceptic MP Iain Duncan-Smith, bringing to more than 20 the number
of Tory back benchers prepared to offer public backing.
However, he has so far failed to produce any ''big name''
endorsements, either from among his former Cabinet colleagues or from
the ranks of senior former Ministers who have criticised the Government,
strengthening the impression of a campaign that is failing to take off.
Mr Redwood disclosed that he would ask the present Cabinet to stay in
place for the short term, pending a summer reshuffle. The future of
individual Ministers would depend on their willingness to endorse his
tax and spending package.
''I will ask my colleagues to confess their sins,'' he said. ''Where's
the money hidden in their budgets? Where are the inefficiencies? Those
who answer well will have good prospects. As Prime Minister, I will lead
from the front and expenditure will be reduced at the first main meeting
of the Cabinet.''
He refused to say who his choice for Chancellor or Foreign Secretary
would be. And asked if Mr Major would be offered a post in a Redwood
Government, he said: ''I would have to think about that''.
Instead, he emphasised his own leadership abilities, and in particular
his readiness to give direction to his party. ''If the team is doing
badly the captain has to do something about it. He has to lead,
encourage, tell them how they can do it.''
Morality will also play a prominent role in Mr Redwood's policies.
Although it was up to individual Members of Parliament to decide how to
behave, his government would demand higher standards, he said, and
incoming Ministers would be interviewed to ensure they understood what
would be required of them.
Despite his populist approach -- his policies announced so far range
from helping the elderly to saving the royal yacht -- Mr Redwood denied
it was modelled on the radical American politician Newt Gingrich, who
led the Republicans' successful recapture of Congress last year.
Comparisons were flattering because Mr Gingrich was a winner, he said,
but there were big differences between Republicans and British
Conservatives. ''I rest on my policies, not on his.''
He rejected the suggestion that he was no more than a ''super stalking
horse'', a John the Baptist making the way straight for his fellow
right-winger, Employment Secretary Michael Portillo.
''I'm in this contest to win the leadership of the Conservative Party.
There is no second ballot at the moment. There are no other candidates.
MPs have to make a simple choice: whether they like me and my ideas for
the future of Conservatism or whether they like the Prime Minister.''

THE wife of John Redwood yesterday praised her husband's ''bravery''
in challenging for the Tory leadership as she spoke for the first time
of her initial fears that he could be jeopardising his political career.
Gail Redwood said she stood by her husband's decision to fight for the
Premiership and described him as a man of principle who could not live a
lie.
However, revealing her reservations about his gamble, she said: ''It
had taken him a long time to build up his career, and I felt he may well
be throwing it all away.''
She said her husband was ''shocked, shocked, shocked'' by John Major's
decision to resign as Tory leader, leaving the party in limbo.
He was ''crestfallen'' after the Prime Minister's refusal to be
persuaded -- after a meeting between the two men last Wednesday -- of
the need for a radical new agenda.
Describing the moment her husband told her he was throwing his hat
into the ring, Mrs Redwood said: ''John told me 'I can't lie. I have to
be straight.' That is typical of John -- what you see is what you get.''
Her priority now was to shield their children, Catherine, 16, and
Richard, 12, from media scrutiny and ''keep up normality for them''.
She said there was a news black-out at home and she had not read the
newspapers. In the car, the radio was switched off.
Mrs Redwood 46, a senior British Airways executive, said her husband
was told of Mr Major's intention to resign by Home Secretary Michael
Howard little more than an hour before the Prime Minister made public
his decision.
''The overwhelming impression John had was 'Why has the Prime Minister
done this? He has precipitated something we were trying to help him
avoid.'
''John rang me at home at 4.45pm and just said: 'You'll never guess
what has happened.' I said: 'What?' and thought I'd better sit down
because something ghastly had happened.
''Your heart leaps. You think -- car crash, somebody has died. You
think of some family crisis, not necessarily a work thing.''
Mrs Redwood said she did not initially understand the significance of
Mr Major's announcement.
''I think I said to John: 'What does it mean?' And he said: 'Mr Major
has resigned as leader, not as Prime Minister.'
''I said: 'What does that mean?' And he said: 'There has to be a
contest.'''She added: ''We just left the conversation there.''
By Sunday, the course had become clear. Both knew he would resign the
next day as Welsh Secretary and challenge the Prime Minister for the
Tory leadership hours later.

IT speaks volumes about Mr Major's charisma that his Commons statement
on the Euro-summit in Cannes, made in the intensely dramatic
circumstances of his own job being at stake, should have turned out to
be just as much of a drag as all his other reports have been. By the
end, the Tory benches were much less than half full -- the others
clearly preferring plotting to listening.
The only charisma on display was provided by Mr Tony Blair. When he
said more needed to be done for the long-term unemployed, some Tories
unwisely shouted ''Where's the money coming from?''
Mr Blair pointed out that Vulcan Redwood had just announced that
#5000m could be hoovered up just from cracking down on Government waste.
''We could have a programme for the long-term unemployed. We could
finance the royal yacht'' (one of the few specific Redwood pledges which
has left him looking faintly ridiculous) ''and we could have enough left
over for a new Prime Ministerial spaceship to help him in his bilaterals
with Planet Portillo,'' he mocked.
Though this reference to Mr Redwood as the candidate from Outer Space
cannot have displeased Mr Major, Mr Blair's recital of the differing
Cabinet views on a Euro-currency was less helpful. He told Mr Major:
''There are now at least nine different positions on record . . . and
you are responsible for three of them.''
Scanning the Treasury Bench manned by Major loyalists, Mr Blair noted
the conspicuous absence of Messrs Heseltine and Portillo, ''probably
because they are putting in the telephone lines''. The reference to
possible second ballot headquarters was not lost on the scowling Tories.
Supporters of these pretended loyalists had been plotting like mad in Mr
Major's absence, he said, ''twisting the knives, striking deals,
briefing the papers in a way that would have made Francis Urquhart
blush''.
Mr Blair then threw in a bit about ''defeat'', ''squalor,'' and
''unfit to govern'', and sat down. After that, it was downhill all the
way. Mr Major tried a piece about Labour divisions on Europe but none of
the punches hurt. Mr Blair shrugged.
Mr Major bravely said that, for all this talk of twisting knives, he
was unbloodied and would remain unblooded. Clear winner of the prize for
Prime Ministers keeping cheerful in adversity (at least in public), he
was able to take out any annoyance he might have been feeling on Mr Bill
Cash (Stafford), who he knows will definitely will not be voting for
him.
Mr Cash, whose views on Europe verge on obsession, asked, as his wont,
a complex question which only the European cognoscenti can have grasped.
Mr Major, first preserving parliamentary decorum, replied: ''With great
respect, you are talking through the back of your head,'' adding: ''I
have never heard such claptrap in my life.''
Mr Major was at his best as he explained carefully to Mr Tony Wright
(Cannock and Burntwood -- Lab.) his reasons for sitting on the fence on
the single currency. It was a good and persuasive exposition and one saw
again why foreign leaders admire him as a negotiator. However, a
disgruntled Tory Party seems to want something more. This rather grey,
plucky, persistent man won one election unexpectedly for them, but they
are far from sure he can do it again.
At the end of his formal statement, Mr Major paid a handsome tribute
to the retiring Foreign Secretary. As he ended his brief political
epitaph on Mr Hurd, Cassandra Skinner prophesied: ''There'll be saying
that about you next week.''

<HEADLINE>Lawyer claims new evidence will clear Clegg</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEW evidence will show that Private Lee Clegg could not have fired the
shot which, it was claimed, killed the teenage joyrider for whose murder
he was jailed for life, his legal adviser said yesterday.
Experts had identified the weapons responsible for the three bullets
which hit the car from behind -- one of which the prosecution said
killed 17-year-old passenger Karen Reilly -- and ''we can say
categorically they were not Private Clegg's'', said Mr Simon McKay.
''We have been able to identify whose weapons they did come from,
although we are not going to identify them at this stage.''
The new evidence from a consultant forensic scientist and a consultant
pathologist -- who travelled to Northern Ireland to examine the bullet
fragments -- is to be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Mr McKay said it would also form part of a fresh application for the
case to go back to the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.
The 26-year-old Paratrooper, jailed for the killing of Miss Reilly at
an Army checkpoint in Belfast in September 1990, is awaiting a decision
by Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew on a recommendation by
the Life Sentence Review Board that he should be released from Wakefield
jail.
Private Clegg's case has always been that the teenager was not killed
by one of the bullets fired from behind the car but that was the
prosecution argument on which he was convicted.
Mr McKay said: ''I am confident that, in due course of time, I will be
able to satisfy the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland that Private
Clegg did not fire after the car had passed him as the trial judge
found.
''I think I will be able to go further and show who did fire and this
evidence will be forwarded to the DPP at the correct time.
''In the meantime, Private Clegg continues to await knowledge of his
fate. I urge the Prime Minister to now personally intervene in this case
to effect Private Clegg's immediate release.''
Mr McKay said he would await a decision from the Secretary of State
about whether the case should be referred to the Court of Appeal before
sending his new evidence to the DPP.
He accused the Government of ''the most outrageous and cynical
procrastination'' in delaying a decision on Private Clegg's release,
which he said was pushing his family to breaking point.
He said the papers had gone to Sir Patrick on June 6 and he understood
the Secretary of State had already spoken to the Lord Chief Justice for
Northern Ireland and the trial judge.
''There can only be two reasons for any further delay,'' said Mr
McKay.
''First, to appease those who object to Private Clegg's release in the
context of the political process in Northern Ireland as a whole. Or
secondly, because of the leadership election currently under way within
the Conservative Party.
''Either way it is both an unconstitutional and perverse way to treat
a citizen of the UK.''

<TEXT>
SINN Fein attacked the British Government last night for threatening
to push ahead with Northern Ireland all-party talks without it.
Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said the delay in the
decommissioning of weapons would not be allowed to hold up dialogue.
Until the IRA started to hand over the guns, it could have no place at
the negotiating table.
However, the warning angered Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams and SDLP
chairman Mark Durkan who accused Sir Patrick of being ''downright
irresponsible''.
Sir Patrick said: ''The political talks process will have to proceed
without Sinn Fein. It will not leave the nationalist viewpoint
unrepresented. It is not right to suppose that Sinn Fein are the only or
even the largest nationalist party.
''Nobody is going to hold up the development of the talks process by
making conditions of that kind.''
Even though no date has been set for the start of talks between all
sides in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick's threat to move on confirmed the
Government's exasperation over the IRA's refusal to make some sort of
movement on weapons.
Mr Major and the Republic's Prime Minister, Mr John Bruton, who met in
Cannes on Tuesday, apparently moved towards reaching agreement on how
they want decommissioning to be handled. Sinn Fein has insisted it
cannot happen in advance of an overall settlement.
Mr Adams accused Sir Patrick of pandering to the Tory right wing as a
tactic of the leadership contest.
He said: ''All sensible people know the process must be moved on into
all-party talks. When John Bruton met Mr Major he was aware of a very
clear understanding of what was required to consolidate the process.
''Everyone must ensure London does not reduce this unprecedented
opportunity for peace into a single-item agenda or some part of what is
essentially a domestic or inter-party matter for British Tories.''
Decommissioning will be raised when the Republic's Foreign Affairs
Minister, Mr Dick Spring, meets Sir Patrick at a meeting of the UK-Irish
Conference in London on Friday.
However, it is clear any move to call all-party talks at this stage
without Sinn Fein's involvement is unlikely to have the approval of the
main nationalist party in Northern Ireland.

GOVERNMENT plans for dealing with anti-social behaviour on housing
estates by allowing councils to put new tenants on a year's probation,
were yesterday attacked as ''discriminatory'' by the Scottish Consumer
Council.
The consumer watchdog has told the Scottish Office, in comments on its
recent consultation paper, that, as only a small number of people are
involved, there is no logic in a proposal which would reduce the rights
of all new tenants.
Chairwoman of the council, Ms Deirdre Hutton, explained:
''Probationary tenancies would place the problem of anti-social
behaviour at the feet of public sector tenants. The rights of all new
tenants would be reduced and the behaviour of new tenants would come
under a scrutiny not applied to anyone else.
''This would leave the new tenants in a vulnerable position, open to
discrimination by their neighbours. Problems caused by long-standing
tenants and by private sector residents would still not be addressed by
a probationary tenancies scheme.''
Ms Hutton added: ''Housing management and the police should work
together to deal with the problems of anti-social behaviour, physical
abuse, racial harrassment, and other criminal activities. Housing
officers should not be expected to have sole responsibility.''

IRA bomber Donna Maguire arrived back in Dublin to a heroine's welcome
from friends and supporters last night. She had earlier been freed by a
German court -- just hours after being jailed for nine years for her
part in an attack on a British Army base.
The court, at Celle, near Hanover, set Maguire free because she had
already served about two-thirds of the sentence in prisons while being
held on remand, said spokesman Harmut Wick.
The moves came just hours after 28-year-old Maguire was found guilty
of taking part in the bombing of the Quebec barracks at Osnabruck, in
1989.
Maguire was convicted of attempted murder, explosives offences, and
spying on British military installations in Germany.
Last night, when she arrived in Dublin from Frankfurt with her father
Malachy, around 50 supporters had gathered at the airport arrivals area
to greet her. They carried a large banner with the words ''Failte
Abhaile Donna'' -- ''Welcome Home Donna''.
She appeared shortly after 9pm but refused to speak to waiting
reporters on her way to a secret reunion with her family.
The former convent girl from Newry, County Down, had spent almost six
years on a ''European tour'' of jails in Ireland, Belgium, Holland, and
Germany. During the trial at Celle, she became the longest serving
remand prisoner in German legal history.
Mr Wick said the court sentenced Maguire to nine years on three
charges, the attempted murder of British soldiers, planting explosives,
and spying on British military installations with intent to sabotage.
''The judge lifted the arrest warrant on her because she has nearly
served two-thirds of her sentence in remand prisons already,'' he said.
Outside the court, defence lawyer Barbara Klawitter said Maguire was
determined to fight for a full acquittal of the charges, which she
denies.
Ulster Unionist Party security spokesman Ken Maginnis yesterday
welcomed the conviction.
It was expected that she would be freed if found guilty because of the
time she had already spent in custody, said the MP for Fermanagh and
South Tyrone.
Sinn Fein, however, condemned the sentence and insisted that the
verdict was of a ''purely political nature''.
The party's spokesman on prison issues, Councillor Pat McGeown, said
informed legal opinion made it clear that after two trials in Germany
''not a single shred of evidence has been presented to back charges
against Donna Maguire''.
German police had called Maguire, who helped to mastermind one of the
IRA's most concerted campaigns outside Northern Ireland, the most feared
woman in Europe.
Early in 1989, she slipped into Europe as a key member of the IRA's
''Continental Unit'', operating from The Hague and Hanover.
In the following 18 months, seven people were killed and several
injured in a series of bombings and shootings in Germany and Holland.
With her arrest, and that of three other suspects in June 1990, IRA
activity on mainland Europe ceased.
In the first big joint operation by European anti-terrorist squads,
police forces in Holland, Belgium, Britain, and Germany began compiling
a detailed dossier on Maguire before she walked free from a Dublin court
in February 1990.
She had been arrested as she left a ferry from Cherbourg with a
Belfast IRA man. In his suitcase were 10 mercury-tilt switches -- used
to make car bombs -- and a quantity of sodium chlorate.
Traces of the explosive chemical, along with lists of weaponry and
colour reconnaissance photographs of British bases in Germany, were
found in her rucksack.
West Germany applied for Maguire's extradition in connection with a
failed bomb attempt at Quebec barracks at Osnabruck in June 1989, and
the car-bomb murder of British soldier Corporal Steven Smith at Hanover,
in July 1989.
When cleared on the explosive charge, she was not re-arrested and
almost immediately headed back to the Continent to rejoin her unit.
It was the first of three acquittals of IRA-related charges in three
countries -- Germany, Holland, and the Irish Republic -- before
yesterday's conviction for the Osnabruck bombing.
On June 16, 1990, four months after her release from prison in Dublin,
Maguire was arrested again after police heard shots in a forest in
Belgium.
She was in possession of a false US passport in the name of Pamela
Shaul, and charged with membership of a criminal organisation and
illegal possession of arms.
The case never came to trial.
Extradited to Holland, she was tried and acquitted in 1991, of the
murder in Roermond, a year earlier, of two Australian tourists mistaken
by the IRA for British servicemen.
Switched to Germany, a Dusseldorf court acquitted her last June of
charges of bombing a British Army base near Hanover in May 1990, and of
involvement in the murder of Major Michael Dillon-Lee in Dortmund, the
following month.

<HEADLINE>Professor Black's report on Monklands District Council provokes organisation to go public.  Catholic Knights threaten action</HEADLINE>

THE Order of the Knights of St Columba (KSC), an organisation for
Roman Catholic men, yesterday threatened to take legal action over
Professor Robert Black's report on Monklands District Council.
Leaders of the order declared that none of the councillors was a
member of the KSC, denied it was a secret society, and rejected any
comparison with freemasonry.
In his report published last week, the Edinburgh University law
professor and QC referred at one stage to the national code of conduct
for councillors and pointed out that they should disclose membership of
organisations when decisions affecting those organisations' or their
members' interests were being discussed.
He continued: ''It has repeatedly been suggested to the inquiry that a
number of the elected members who serve on important committees are
members of the Knights of St Columba.
''There is, of course, no suggestion that there is anything improper
in such membership but it must be stressed that a declaration of
interest should be made by any councillor who is a member when the
council is making decisions affecting any member of the public who is
known by the councillor to be a member of the organisation.
''This duty of disclosure is specifically mentioned in the code with
regard to freemasons and the same duty must exist in relation to the
Knights of St Columba.''
Yesterday, the Order of the Knights of St Columba took the unusual
step of holding a news conference at its Glasgow HQ to respond to
Professor Black's report.
The order's national president, Mr Tony Britten, said in a prepared
statement that at no time had the professor or anyone else involved in
the inquiry contacted the order to check ''the bald assertion'' that
councillors on important committees were members.
''We are entitled to know the identity of those who made such
suggestions,'' said Mr Britten. ''There are no elected members of the
said council in the Knights of St Columba. We are entitled to know why
such assertions were not checked. The inference is quite obvious taken
within the content and purpose of the report.''
It was also a serious matter when relationship was made to ''another
organisation'' with whom the order had no connection or similarity of
constitution, incorporation or internal practice.
The order had instructed its Scottish legal adviser, Mr Peter McCann,
to make ''certain inquiries'' from Professor Black and a ''certain
newspaper'' whose recent article had failed to reach the standard of
investigation and responsibility expected from a responsible free press.
The order was a non-political body with charitable aims, stressed Mr
Britten.
''We want no sectarianism in the UK. We deplore that we have been
obliged to react to make straight the record. We trust that we can
establish to our satisfaction that no-one is left in doubt that we have
been inequitably referred to in an exercise required by a political
party in a council where we have no connection.
''If that is not achieved, then we will take advantage of our
constitutional right at law.''
Answering reporters' questions, Mr Britten said there had been a slur
on the organisation's good name. ''The implications are that we are a
secret society, that we are manipulating things, and that we are
controlling certain councillors.''
He said that of the 105 members the order had in the Monklands area,
only 15 were employees of the council. None of them was a senior
official.
Mr McCann, a former Lord Provost of Glasgow, declined to say what
grounds, if any, he believed the order might have for taking legal
action over Professor Black's report.
Once he had received a reply from the professor, he would advise his
clients accordingly, he said, adding: ''I am not prepared to advise in
public what I will advise in private.''
During a special meeting of the Monklands council last Friday to
discuss Professor Black's report, all of the ruling Labour group members
present stated that they were not members of the order.
The council rejected the principal criticisms contained in the report
and agreed to seek ''clarifications and corrections'' from the professor
on a number of points.

THE Labour Party was last night taking legal advice over whether it
could proceed with an investigation into the affairs of Monklands
District Council in the light of the official Scottish Office inquiry
announced yesterday.
The Shadow Scottish Secetary, Mr George Robertson, said: ''The
decision to hold an inquiry is unaltered but questions about its timing,
form, and scope will have to depend on what legal advice we get.
''I think that if the Labour Party had not acted with such firmness
last week, the Government might never have moved. They have now acted
with such suddenness and swiftness because they realised they were being
outflanked.''
There was considerable anger within the Labour hierarchy about the
Government's response, quite apart from suspicion about its timing and
motivation. It was pointed out yesterday that the Secretary of State for
Scotland had always had sweeping powers to order such a Section 211
inquiry even solely on the basis of his own ''opinion'' that such an
inquiry was necessary.
Officials pointed out that this ''opinion'' need only extend to any
doubts over whether Section 7 of the Local Government and Housing Act
1989 was being complied with. This states that ''every appointment of a
person to a paid office or employment under a local authority in
Scotland shall be made on merit''.
One party official said: ''It is clear on the basis of this that Ian
Lang could have chosen to act at any time over the past few years. He
did not have to await evidence or the Black report. We have him banged
to rights on this.''
The NEC unanimously endorsed the Scottish Labour Party's decision to
suspend the entire Monklands District Labour group in the wake of
Professor Black's revelations of nepotism and spending irregularities.
It launched its own investigation, to be directed by a senior Labour
official from party headquarters in London, to determine what
disciplinary action, if any, is required.
The official, expected to be named next week, will have experience in
handling party investigations into local party abuses. The party's aim
is to produce recommendations for the NEC within weeks.
Meanwhile, local reaction to yesterday's announcement of a full public
inquiry was muted, with council leader Jim Brooks not available for
comment and Provost Eric Burns issuing a terse statement.
The provost said: ''I welcome the Secretary of State's decision to
institute this inquiry. The council asked him to do this almost three
years ago and I can assure everyone that we will co-operate fully with
this inquiry.
''I am confident that this inquiry will give a different picture to
that which has been presented so far.''
Councillor Burns and his 11 Monklands district colleagues elected to
the North Lanarkshire authority in April were due to attend a Labour
group meeting of the new council in Motherwell last night but now find
themselves outside that group, denied the Labour whip on both
authorities.
* The 12 councillors on the North Lanarkshire authority who were
suspended from the Labour Party as a result of yesterday's NEC ruling
are:
Mr Jim Brooks (leader), Mr Eric Burns (provost), Mr Tony Clarke, Mr
Arthur Fitzpatrick, Ms Betty Leitch, Mr Jim Smith, Mr Hugh Lucas, Mr
Thomas Curley, and Mr Tom Maginnis; plus three of the four so-called
Labour rebels who protested about the running of Monklands district, Mr
Jim Logue, Mr Tommy Morgan, and Mr Peter Sullivan.
Three other Monklands councillors who were also suspended last week by
the Labour Party did not win seats on the new authority: Mr Patrick
Boyle, Mr Edward Cairns, and the fourth rebel, Mr Brian Brady.
Two further councillors, Mr John Dillon and Mr Joseph Quinn, were
first elected to Monklands as Labour members but resigned some time ago
to sit as Independents and will not be on the new authority.

A SUSPECT who confessed to police after they threatened to expose his
relationship with a married woman to her husband, suffered a miscarriage
of justice, three appeal court judges ruled yesterday.
In his summation, Lord Ross, Lord Justice Clerk, who presided at the
appeal, said: ''The rules of fairness and fair dealing were flagrantly
transgressed in this case.''
The Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the conviction of Mr Steven
Roche, 41, for theft by housebreaking, for which he was jailed for nine
months.
Mr Roche, of West High Street, Buckhaven, Fife, was jailed at Cupar
Sheriff Court for the offence, which took place on February 28 last
year, at a house in Newburgh, Fife.
He appealed on the grounds that the sheriff should not have allowed
evidence of a taped police interview to go to the jury.
His counsel, Mr John Beckett, argued that it was unfair for police to
offer an inducement or threat or apply pressure to force a suspect to
confess.
During the interview, Mr Roche was asked about an alleged relationship
between him and a married woman. The suggestion was that it was through
this relationship that he had set up the housebreaking.
When Mr Roche continued to deny that he knew the woman, one of the
officers conducting the interview told him they would have to go to the
woman's house with a search warrant.
They said that the woman's husband might be home, and that he probably
knew nothing about what was going on. If there was a relationship
between Mr Roche and the woman and her husband knew nothing about it,
they could understand the predicament Mr Roche and the woman would be
in.
If he persisted in saying that he did not know the woman, they would
have to go to see her immediately.
Mr Roche asked what the alternative was and was told that police could
telephone the woman and arrange to see her at some time in the future.
The officer explained that such an arrangement would not cause the woman
any difficulties, and the police were not in the business of breaking up
marriages.
Mr Roche then admitted that he knew the woman and gave details about
the housebreaking.
Mr Beckett said it had been made clear to Mr Roche that if he did not
confess police would go to the woman's home. He argued that to allow the
statement to go to the jury in these circumstances rendered the fairness
test meaningless.
The Crown emphasised that there had been no question of physical
violence and claimed there had been no flagrant unfairness.
However, Lord Ross said: ''We have come to the conclusion that the
present case was one where no reasonable jury could hold that the
incriminatory statements made by Roche were voluntary, and had not been
extracted by unfair or improper means.
''It is plain that there was a lack of fairness here, and that the
incriminatory answers were obtained from Roche as a result of inducement
and pressure.
''If the police had information implicating the woman Roche was said
to be associating with, they could have gone to her house with a search
warrant. Instead, they used the information to put pressure on Roche to
incriminate himself.
''They were offering the inducement that if he spoke up they would not
go straight to the woman's house, which might lead to her husband
finding out about the relationship.
''In these circumstances, we agree that the rules of fairness and fair
dealing were flagrantly transgressed in this case.''
Lord Ross added: ''We recognise that where issues of fairness are
being considered it is necessary to consider not only the interests of a
suspect or accused. One must also have regard to the public interest in
the ascertainment of truth and in the detection and suppression of
crime.
''No-one wishes to impede proper police investigation, but we are
satisfied that the questioning of Roche went too far.''

<TEXT>
Buckingham Palace published annual accounts for the first time
yesterday -- detailing how it spent #20m of taxpayers' money last year.
Publication of the Grant-in-Aid report for 1994-95 follows criticisms
that many Royal Household staff and courtiers were living rent free in
so-called grace-and-favour accommodation.
In all, #20.5m was spent during the last financial year on royal
palaces including: Buckingham Palace; Kensington Palace; St James's
Palace; Clarence House; Windsor Castle, and several smaller properties.
Much of the spending was on installation of automatic fire-detection
equipment in the wake of the 1992 Windsor Castle fire.
Grant-in-Aid also contributes 30% towards restoration work at the
castle, with 70% paid for from the profits of opening Buckingham Palace
to the public.
Since the financial year 1992-93, spending on electricity has been cut
by 9%, on gas by 17%, and on water charges by 53%.
The accounts show that #3m was saved last year.
The report said restoration work at Windsor Castle was progressing
well and should be completed by mid-1998 within the budget of less than
#40m.
Fire detection and prevention work should be completed by April 1997.
Rewiring at Clarence House, the Queen Mother's residence, will also be
undertaken for ''fire-safety reasons''.
The Royal Household aims to reduce annual grant-in-aid to #15m by the
year 2000, after completing work at Windsor.
The Queen took over direct responsibility for running the occupied
palaces from the Department of the Environment in 1991 and appointed Mr
Michael Peat as her finance and property services director.
The report details Mr Peat's salary -- he is the highest-paid royal
official -- at #140,000.
Mr Peat said: ''The report demonstrates that the Royal Household has
made encouraging progress . . . in achieving substantial savings for the
taxpayer.
''We hope to have saved more than #70m by the end of the decade.''
Since 1991, the palace has submitted four annual accounts to the
Department of National Heritage, which until now chose not to make the
figures public.
Royal officials have always insisted they have no objection to the
accounts being published but the decision lay with Government Ministers.

CAMPAIGNERS wanting a Millennium Forest for Scotland are trying for
100,000 signatures to back their idea of restoring native woodlands.
Their proposal, they say, is the only all-Scotland one of the 14
Scottish bids shortlisted by the Millennium Commission for funding this
year. It would cost #100m.
By July 20, the group behind the bid hopes to have collected the
100,000 signatures to show the commission that one of its criteria has
been satisfied -- that the project has widespread public support.
Mr Simon Pepper, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature in Scotland,
and one of the prime movers behind the project, said that the bid
already met another of the criteria laid down by the commission -- that
funding should go to ''projects which give something back to the natural
world after centuries of taking from it''.
He added: ''Native woods are very special places. They are a beautiful
element of the landscape, an important habitat for wildlife, and a haven
for the human spirit. They are a productive and self-perpetuating, but
very much neglected, economic resource. They are also threatened. Some
96% of native woods have been destroyed -- victims of other land use
priorities.''
If funding is forthcoming, the initiative is expected to provide for
500 separate projects, ranging from educational to economic to
replanting proposals.
Mr Magnus Magnusson, chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage said:
''This is a very Scottish initiative, enriching the environment through
a natural process.''
Jimmie Macgregor, writer, broadcaster, and environmentalist, said:
''One of the great aspects of this project to me is that it is aimed at
interesting young children. If a child plants a tree he won't stand
around and watch another kid kick it down.''

Police believe a father stabbed his six-year-old daughter to death
then killed himself by setting fire to his cottage in Denton, near
Garsington, Oxfordshire.
The body of Rachel Endsor was found in the back garden of her home
after firefighters were called to tackle a blaze at the cottage
yesterday -- inside they found the charred body of her father Richard
Endsor. A report is being prepared for the Oxfordshire coroner, but
no-one else is being sought in connection with the deaths.

<HEADLINE>Hearing orders pharmacist to be struck off</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A PHARMACIST from Dumfries-shire was ordered to be struck off
yesterday for misconduct after a disciplinary hearing heard that he had
supplied a patient with eye drops which could have cost him his sight.
Mr Moses Kungu gave the man -- Mr S -- the drops, containing a
powerful steroid, at his pharmacy in Deli Road, Eastriggs, on May 28
last year without a prescription and without contacting his GP in nearby
Gretna, even though the doctor was on duty, it was claimed.
Mr Victor Franklin, an inspector for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society,
told its statutory committee in London that the taking of such eye
drops, except under the strictest controls, could cause ''loss of vision
or even the loss of an eye''. They also could result in chronic
glaucoma, he added.
The patient's doctor, who complained to the society, felt that the use
of these drugs in treating eye infections without assessment by a
consultant opthalmologist was ''dangerous''.
He also believed a prescription for any eyedrops containing steroids
required hospital assessment of the patient.
The committee was told this was just one of a catalogue of complaints
against the pharmacist regarding his three premises at Eastriggs, in
High Street, Lockerbie, where he lives, and in Main Street, Kirkconnel.
Mr Josselyn Hill, solicitor to the society, said Mr Kungu had
''apparently ignored'' requests for him to provide a satisfactory
closure between two properties owned by him at Lockerbie since 1989.
The two premises are Mr Kungu's pharmacy and a next-door newsagent's
which are connected by a doorway. Access to the public when the pharmacy
was closed should have been prevented by a security door.
Mr Kungu's version of such a door was a piece of expanding garden
trellis ''which could be lifted by anyone using their little finger,''
said Mr Hill.
The Lockerbie pharmacy also dispensed the fungicide nail solution
Trosyl, with an expiry date of July 1993, to a patient on January 19,
1994.
A further complaint concerned claims that although the Eastriggs
premises were open 40 hours a week, a pharmacist was employed for only
28 hours, said Mr Hill.
Mr Kungu told the committee that he had tried to become part of the
Lockerbie community, especially by getting involved with helping as a
local councillor after the 1988 PanAm jet outrage.
He admitted he knew he had broken the law by giving the eye lotion to
Mr S but said he had gone to his Eastriggs pharmacy ''on a mission of
mercy'' to try to help a patient suffering agony with his eyes.
He claimed he had been suffering great financial difficulties with the
Eastriggs and Kirkconnel pharmacies, which had prevented him with making
some of the improvements he would have liked.
Chairman Mr Gary Flather, QC, said the committee accepted that Mr
Kunga was caring and compassionate and this was shown by the fact he had
become a regional councillor in 1987.
However, the failure to replace the trellis over six years and his
failure to put right the conditions at Kirkconnel were in themselves
sufficient to render him unfit to be a pharmacist.
The incident with the eyedrops and, to a lesser extent, the frequent
lack of a pharmacist at the Eastriggs pharmacy, also were serious
misconduct.

THE Government came under renewed pressure in the Commons yesterday to
react more urgently to the problems revealed by the Braer tanker
spillage off Shetland.
In a brief Commons debate, the Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and
Shetland, Mr Jim Wallace, said there had been a lot of good intentions
around at the time. He now wanted to see a sense of urgency.
The tanker ran aground in January 1993, bringing fears of huge
pollution in the area and setting off a heated debate about the safety
and procedures of taking tankers through those waters.
The Government commissioned a report from Lord Donaldson, which was
published 13 months ago. It accepted 86 of Lord Donaldson's 103
recommendations, and said it was considering a further 13, but yesterday
Mr Wallace argued that not enough was being done.
He told the House: ''I want to inject into this debate a sense of
impatience. We cannot just sit around and wait. It is now some
two-and-a-half years since the Braer ran aground and there are important
lessons to be learned.
''It is important we keep up the pressure to ensure this issue does
not go underground -- or under water -- until there is another maritime
casualty around our shores.''
Mr Wallace accepted that some action had been taken, but he wanted the
Government to publish a timetable for further action. The talking had to
stop and the action had to start.
Transport Minister Steven Norris said Lord Donaldson's report had been
excellent and he wanted to make clear the Government's commitment to the
whole process.
However, he added: ''Putting to one side the many initiatives we have
already undertaken, we have undertaken to consult on a number of key
issues.
''The complexities of these matters, and the recognition by Lord
Donaldson himself of the need to further develop some of his
recommendations, all mean that a) we are obliged to consult widely and
b) we will have to proceed, generally speaking, through the
International Maritime Organisation or some other international
organisations.''
During the debate, Labour MP Calum Macdonald (Western Isles) voiced
fears about the deep-sea route recommended for tankers in his area. ''It
has been a long-standing worry among my constituents that the route is
still too close to shore and should be extended farther to seaward,'' he
said.
Tory Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne), who has practised as a shipping
lawyer, said the Braer's master was ''very much to blame for failing to
do certain things'', yet he was still plying around the world.

A HUSBAND suffering from morbid jealousy syndrome was jailed for eight
years yesterday for the violent killing of his wife.
The High Court in Edinburgh had been told that Bryan Pringle became
convinced his wife, Heather, was having an affair with her boss and made
up his mind to kill himself while forcing her to watch.
Instead, it was his wife who suffocated after he tied her up and
gagged her.
Pringle, 48, of Allan Park Loan, Slateford, Edinburgh, was originally
charged with the murder of his 45-year-old wife at their home on March
25 or 26 this year but the Crown accepted his plea to the charge of
culpable homicide.
Three psychiatrists who had examined Pringle considered that at the
time of the offence he was suffering from a mental disorder which
reduced his responsibility for his actions. One described the condition
as morbid jealousy syndrome.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, was told that the root cause of the
killing was the worsening relationship between Pringle and his wife.
Sexual relationships had ended and the couple occupied separate
bedrooms.
Despite the state of the marriage, Pringle could not bear the thought
that his wife might be having a relationship with another man. He became
convinced that she was after he discovered that she was on the pill
although he had undergone a vasectomy.
On March 17 this year, Mrs Pringle went to a dinner with her boss and
Pringle saw them kissing in a car after her boss gave her a lift home.
A week later, Pringle pounced on his wife as she returned from a night
at the theatre. He punched her, grabbed her by the throat, and knelt on
her back before tying her hands and gagging her with a tea towel.
She died through suffocation, coupled with other injuries, caused by
what the Crown described as a sustained and determined assault. The
couple's two younger children returned home, unaware that their mother's
body was lying behind a locked bedroom door.
Pringle later told psychiatrists that he had intended to immobilise
his wife so that she had no choice but to watch him commit suicide.
Mr Derek Ogg, defence counsel, said yesterday that there was no
previous history of domestic violence in the case and the offence was
the result of a severe mental illness from which Pringle had been
suffering at the time.
There was nothing to suggest that Mrs Pringle had deserved anything
other than the best of support from him and Pringle did not wish to
attack her behaviour in any way.
He recognised that his conduct was ''bizarre and inexplicable''.
''It has left him with a considerable amount of shame and guilt,''
added Mr Ogg.
''There was no intention to harm her other than to have her witness
his own self-destruction.''
Jailing Pringle for eight years, Lord Ross said he recognised that it
was a tragic case, in which Pringle's diminished responsibility had
reduced the charge to culpable homicide.
However, Pringle had used considerable violence in the attack upon his
wife, which had caused her severe injuries.
Whatever Pringle might have believed about his wife's relationship
with another man was no justification for what he had done.
''My duty is to impose an appropriate sentence for what was a violent
killing.''
The judge said he accepted that the offence was out of character and
that Pringle had been suffering from a depressive illness but added: ''I
cannot close my eyes to the fact that you assaulted your wife, tied her
up, gagged her, and left her to die. My sentence must recognise the
gravity of that offence.''
The couple have three children, Mark, 27, Darren, 24, and Lesley, 19,
and Darren and Lesley still live in the family home.
In a statement issued after sentence was imposed yesterday, Mark
Pringle said: ''My family and I have been devastated by the terrible
tragedy involving both our parents. Today's events simply allow us to
close one area of the tragic incident that has occurred.
''There are still many pieces that we must try to put into perspective
before we can move forward and rebuild our lives.''

THE wife of Hollywood star Michael Douglas has filed for divorce
because she can't stand his womanising.
The 50-year-old actor, whose successes include the raunchy thrillers
Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct, separated from his blonde
36-year-old wife Diandra Luker last Friday.
She said she could no longer put up with the 50-year-old actor's
antics after 18 years of marriage and intends to apply for custody of
their 15-year-old son Cameron.
Her lawyer Dennis Wasser filed the divorce papers at Santa Barbara
Superior Court.
Earlier this year, the couple, who have a luxury home in Los Angeles,
made a last attempt to patch up their rocky marriage which was the talk
of Hollywood gossips.
Ms Luker said: ''These women Michael had didn't care less that he was
a man with a wife. They didn't hesitate. If I had been younger, I would
have left him. But now, for me, my family is the most important thing.''
In September 1992, Douglas checked in to an Arizona clinic which
specialises in so-called ''sex addiction''. He later claimed it was just
a ''cute story'' to publicise Basic Instinct -- famous for its sex
scenes -- and insisted he was treated for the effects of 20 years'
overwork and alcohol abuse.
Ms Luker said of her husband's famed enthusiasm for sex scenes: ''I
often ask why he's picked those roles and I still don't know the answer.
''I think they've made it more difficult for me to live my life. I
would be lying to you if I said this is every woman's dream.''
In March this year, Douglas said he would not film any more sex
scenes, adding: ''They are hard to pull off because sex is one of the
few areas in screen acting where everybody is a judge.''
Ms Luker was brought up in London, Madrid, and Paris and attended
boarding schools in England, Switzerland, and America, where she hoped
to follow her father into the diplomatic service.
Mr Douglas is one of Hollywood's richest men, with hit films including
the Oscar-winning Wall Street and Disclosure, so a divorce settlement is
likely to cost him millions. In 1975, he beat his father Kirk Douglas in
the race to produce One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, starring Jack
Nicholson.
He is a noted workaholic, spending long periods away from home when
the temptations of would-be starlets have been more than he could
resist.
In 1992, Diandra found him in bed with a woman at the five star
Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Staff reported hearing a furious row, with her
demanding he seek help to save their marriage.

THE Prime Minister yesterday pledged his support for former Japanese
internees and prisoners of war who are battling for compensation and an
official apology from Tokyo.
Mr Major was speaking at the Foreign Office as he launched the
Government's plans to mark the 50th anniversary of VJ-Day and the end of
the Second World War.
Reconciliation was notably absent from the themes of the two-day
series of events on August 19 and 20.
Scots will play a prominent role in the events. Mr Harry Tomlin, 90,
from Edinburgh, and an RAF veteran of the Burma campaign, will be one of
the oldest taking part.
He will join passengers on a plane being chartered to carry up to 370
Scots veterans to London for a commemoration service and the march past
outside Buckingham Palace.
The Scots will return to Edinburgh to attend a service of
commemoration at St Giles Cathedral and a sunset ceremony on the
esplanade of Edinburgh Castle the following day.
The Princess Royal will represent the Queen at these events.
Mr Major said there would be total support for former internees and
prisoners of war seeking compensation. The least that might be expected
from the Japanese government was an official apology for war crimes, he
said.
''The world is immeasurably different today but the fact it has
changed does not mean that we can or we should forget what happened,
forget past injustices, or forget past crimes,'' he added.
He declared that the country could never forget the suffering
inflicted.
Mr Major was supported by Burma Star Association president Viscount
Slim, whose father commanded the 14th Army in Burma.
''If we want to forgive, that is an individual business, but no-one
will forget,'' he said.

NUCLEAR physicist Professor Ernest Walton, one of the first scientists
to split the atom, has died aged 92, it was revealed yesterday.
Professor Walton, of Belfast, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1951 with
Sir John Cockcroft, of Harwell, for their fundamental work on the atom.
His funeral service took place yesterday at the Methodist Centenary
Church in Leeson Park, Dublin. Professor Walton was a Fellow of the
city's Trinity College. He and Sir John made headlines in 1932 when they
split the atom at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. They conducted
their experiment in the high voltage electricity department developed by
Lord Rutherford, bombarding atoms with artificially-produced particles
to transform matter for the first time. Their experiments sparked off a
revolution in nuclear physics.

NEWS International is to increase the price of The Times by 5p as from
July 3 to try to combat sharply rising newsprint costs.
Editor Peter Stothard said the move follows a rise in newsprint costs
of 50% in the first six months of this year.
As a result of an increase in demand across the world and the pressure
on production capacity due to paper mill closures, particularly in
Canada, in the earlier years of this decade, newsprint has become a
''seller's market''.
There have been overall price rises of 15% as from the beginning of
this year, with increases of up to 33% coming into effect on July 1.
Additionally, one major Scandinavian producer has forecast an additional
8% charge as from October.
Several titles have had difficulty at times in obtaining supplies for
immediate production. That has led to unconfirmed stories of a major
London based, non-News International broadsheet having a ship carrying
newsprint diverted to a continental port where buyers were offering a
higher price.

THE wife of former Leith MP Ron Brown has died after a long struggle
against cancer.
Mrs May Brown, 52, a mother of two, passed away in a hospice where she
had been for several weeks after fighting a five-year battle against
breast cancer.
It was thought she had beaten the disease after having a breast
removed but earlier this year she fell ill again and moved into St
Columba's Hospice in Edinburgh.
Mr Brown, who recently started a new job with Edinburgh District
Council, was too upset last night to talk about the tragedy. The couple
married in 1963.
His wife, a devout socialist, used to work as her husband's
constituency secretary, taking up local issues on his behalf. She stood
loyally by her husband during his controversial deselection battle five
years ago.
A spokesman for the Leith constituency office said: ''May will be
sadly missed by many people. She had been a major influence in local
politics and had been a staunch supporter of the party.
''She played a very active part when Mr Brown was in office and our
thoughts at this time are with Ron and his family.''
Mr Malcolm Chisholm, who succeeded Mr Brown as MP for Leith, said he
was saddened to hear of her death.
Mr Chisholm, who is secretary of the Commons all party-group on breast
cancer, said: ''Everyone in Leith Labour Party will be sorry to hear the
news. She did a lot of work for the constituency.''
A funeral service will be held on Friday at Warriston crematorium.

SOCIAL security rules which have deprived victims of accidents and
industrial injuries of compensation have been strongly criticised by
lawyers.
The lawyer representing a bakery worker, forced through ill health to
leave his job, said yesterday that the man had been denied around
#20,000 because of the rules of the Government's Compensation Recovery
Unit.
Mr Kenneth Gibson, 34, from Kilmarnock, became asthmatic while working
in a bakery hand-dusting rolls and pies. However, he was advised to
accept an out-of-court settlement of #2500 after four years spent
preparing a claim. Anything over that amount would have been claimed
back by the CRU.
In another case which emerged last night, Mr Patrick Lawlor, 65, from
Ballymena in County Antrim, said the CRU had clawed back #2500 after he
was awarded #41,000 by Glasgow Sheriff Court earlier this month. He had
suffered severe injuries when he was struck by a car outside his former
home in Mount Vernon in Glasgow.
The CRU was set up under the 1992 Social Social Security Act to recoup
compensation as repayment for benefits paid to victims while they are
ill. Both Mr Gibson and Mr Lawlor received invalidity benefit while
preparing their claims.
Mr Gibson's lawyer, Mr Frank Maguire, criticised the system, saying it
left insurance companies laughing all the way to the bank while
penalising victims who had spent years contributing National Insurance
payments.
He said the Government was also in fact losing out, because the rules
made people accept #2500 settlements. In Mr Gibson's case, had he been
diagnosed a year earlier, he would -- if he had won his case -- been
entitled to around #22,000 as the rules had not yet come into force. As
it was, the bakery owners offered an out-of-court settlement a week
before the court hearing and did not admit responsibility.
Mr Gibson said he had been forced to quit his job at Lauders Mather's
bakery in Kilmarnock, now Grays the Country Bakers, in July 1989 after
13 years. He did not start another job until February 1994. During that
period he received benefits totalling #51 a week.
He described how he started to feel faint and often had to be sent
home ill. Finally, after a spell in hospital six years ago, he was
diagnosed as an asthmatic. His father, Mr Jim Gibson, said his son was
wracked by coughing fits every night and his health had been ruined.
''I feel very angry. It's not been his fault that he got asthma. It's
a shame that he doesn't have his full health for the rest of his life.
''He has been fortunate enough to find another job washing cars but
earns #89, much less than he would had he been able to continue as a
baker.''
Mr Gibson's claim was backed by the union Usdaw. Scottish divisional
officer Pat McCormick said that Mr Gibson's claim, which had stood every
chance of success, had effectively been a waste of time.
However, with the rules currently being examined by the Commons Social
Security Select Committee, and 20 similar cases in the pipeline, he
hoped the ''harsh and oppressive'' system would be overhauled.
Mr Lawlor's lawyer, the Glasgow-based solicitor Mr Harry Flowers,
called for a change in the law. ''It's a most unpopular piece of
legislation which has financially hurt an awful lot of people when they
desperately need their compensation to help them get on with life.''

A FATHER pleaded with police yesterday to find and lock up his
13-year-old son, who has gone on the run after being sought in
connection with new alleged offences.
The boy has a criminal record running into several pages, including
arson, assault, criminal damage, and burglary.
He has been treated for drink and drug abuse and is so out of control
that the most secure units in Britain have refused to take him, his
father said.
Social workers in Nottingham have been scouring the country for two
weeks to find a place in a suitable juvenile unit, and the father is
meeting social services managers today in a further bid to solve the
problem.
He said: ''I'm stuck. I still love him and I want him to come home. I
don't want him roaming the streets. He has gone past the point where any
normal person can help him. He needs to be put away for a while for his
own protection.
''The nicer you are to him the nastier he is in return. Sometimes he
will come around for a cuddle, and the next day he is robbing our house.
''I took him to a psychiatrist who said he was fine -- just a bit
boisterous for a 12-year-old boy.''
Nottingham Social Services are worried for the boy's safety, as people
in the community where he has caused havoc, with burglaries and other
crimes, are seeking revenge.
Last night, neighbours on the boy's housing estate revealed they had
formed a squad to track down the youngster, who is believed to be
sleeping rough.
One angry neighbour said: ''We just hope the police get him before we
do. We dare not go out at night knowing he is on the loose.''
The boy's father said his son thought nothing of drinking a bottle of
whisky in an evening, and had frequently been admitted to Nottingham's
Queen's Medical Centre for drink and drugs-related incidents.
As a last ditch measure, his father sent him to a school in Derby for
children with behavioural difficulties. But during a six-month stay he
assaulted teachers more than 200 times.

MODEL Liz Hurley put on a brave face to the world's press yesterday as
her actor boyfriend Hugh Grant kept a low profile following his arrest
on a sex charge in Hollywood.
Ms Hurley lacked her usual dazzling smile as she emerged from a
day-long meeting in London with her employers, the cosmetics company
Estee Lauder, with whom she has a #1m contract.
Dressed in a smart pink suit, she walked from the Halkin Hotel, near
Hyde Park Corner, to be confronted by a large group of reporters and
photographers.
Protected by colleagues amid the jostling throng of clicking
cameramen, she was escorted, silent and straight-faced, to a waiting
Mercedes which drove away at high speed.
Ms Hurley, 29, heard of Grant's vice charge on Tuesday night. He
telephoned her from Hollywood shortly after he was arrested in his
rented car with a prostitute and accused of committing a lewd act in
public.
Grant, 34, star of the hit British comedy film Four Weddings and a
Funeral, had been expected back in Britain yesterday to apologise in
person to Ms Hurley.
However, he was not spotted arriving at either Gatwick or Heathrow
airports.
''We have no idea of his movements,'' said a spokeswoman for his
London agents ICM. The actor's publicists in New York and Los Angeles
also said they were unable to specify his whereabouts.
Ms Hurley arrived for her meeting at the Halkin Hotel after spending
the night at the flat of her friend Lord Henry Brocklehurst, who runs
his own film company.
Her reaction to heart-throb Grant, her boyfriend of nine years, is
thought to be crucial in determining whether the public will also be
lenient towards him.
Grant, in Hollywood to promote his new film Nine Months, was arrested
in the early hours of Tuesday by Los Angeles police.
He swiftly issued a statement in which he said: ''Last night, I did
something completely insane. I have hurt people I love and embarrassed
people I work with. For both things I am more sorry than I can say.''
Grant's image as a clean-cut hero has suffered a blow but the key will
be public response to his latest film, Nine Months, which is released on
July 12 in the United States and in October in Britain.
Grant plays a bumbling, lovable bachelor who is forced to think about
commitment to his girlfriend when she announces she is pregnant.
Ms Hurley's mother Angela said her daughter would carry on working as
usual despite the shock of Grant's arrest.
''Liz will not be visiting us because she is working in London for
Estee Lauder for the next two days,'' said Mrs Hurley, speaking at the
gate of the cottage in North Waltham, Hampshire, where she lives with
her husband Major Roy Hurley.
* Ms Hurley's parents were caught up in further embarrassment
yesterday when one of their friends dropped his trousers in front of a
village policeman.
The man, in his 70s, showed off his Y-fronts to the officer and
newsmen who had gathered outside her parents' house.
The man, who had earlier taken the Hurleys' dog for a walk around the
village, was let off with a police warning.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry launched after blunder frees swindler</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AN INQUIRY has been launched after it emerged a notorious swindler was
wrongly released last week.
Police have been informed that Barry Gray, who has spent a lifetime
conning victims with carefully crafted webs of deceit, was ''unlawfully
at large''.
The 61-year-old ''gentleman swindler'', as he likes to call himself,
was sentenced to two years imprisonment by senior Southwark Crown Court
judge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC, on Monday last week.
However, apparent confusion over the judge's remarks meant that hours
later the man who regards his dishonesty as a ''profession'', was told
he could go.
In a statement released last night, a Prison Service spokeswoman
confirmed a top level inquiry had been launched.
It was ordered after a news agency contacted the service to ask why
Gray was allowed his freedom when it seemed that was not what the judge
intended.
Gray pled guilty to nine offences of deception and one of attempted
deception involving losses of #3250 between June, 1991 and February,
1993.
The court was told the grey haired, bespectacled Gray had spun tales
of industrial espionage, telephone bugging, secret surveillance and
blackmail for 40 years.
The judge pointed out to him that following his arrest at his home in
Nice in June, 1993, he had ''strenuously'' fought his extradition to
Britain.
''You exhausted all the appeal procedures and it was not until January
10 this year that you were extradited to this country,'' he said.
In his view Gray only had himself to thank for the 18 months in a
French prison.
It was at this stage the judge outlined the way that period in custody
abroad was to be treated by the court.
He told Gray: ''Nevertheless, I consider that justice demands that I
make an allowance for the period you spent in a French prison and I
propose to make a reduction of 18 months from the sentence which would
otherwise be imposed upon you.''
Those in court last week took the judge's remarks to mean that, but
for Gray's spell in the French prison, he would have been jailed for at
least three-and-a-half years.
But after Gray was led down to the cells, a degree of confusion seems
to have set in over what the judge meant in relation to certain parts of
the 1967 Criminal Justice Act and a similarly-entitled piece of
legislation enacted in 1991.
Section 67 of the first Act deals with the computation of sentences of
imprisonment passed in England and Wales.
That states in part that the ''length of any sentence of imprisonment
imposed on an offender by a court shall be treated as reduced by any
relevant period''.
Section 47 of the 1991 legislation concerns prisoners who have been in
custody abroad while awaiting extradition.
That provides for the court to order that time spent behind bars
abroad in this way can be regarded as a ''relevant period'' to be
counted as sentence already served.
It seems those who took the decision to release Gray may have added
the 18-month term to the six months he spent in Britain waiting for his
case to come to court, reached a figure of two years -- the same as the
sentence -- and decided he should be immediately released.
It appears that what should have happened, however, was that only the
six months should have counted against his sentence, meaning that after
the usual 50% remission he would have had just another six months to
serve.
A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said last night it had been informed by
the prison service of the situation but could do nothing until a warrant
was issued for Gray's arrest.

CELTIC Football Club's chances of kicking off the season with their
#18m new stand fully operational have suffered a major setback because
of problems over crowd safety.
The club faces the embarrassing prospect of being unable to use large
sections of the 26,000-seat stand, or having a safety certificate
refused, because police say access to and from it is unsafe.
They are now involved in a race against time to persuade Glasgow
District Council to allow fans to use Janefield Street, to the rear of
the stadium, as an additional route, despite enormous opposition from
local residents.
The club must obtain a new planning consent from the city council and
a separate safety certificate from Strathclyde region before August 5,
the day pencilled in for a friendly against Newcastle United to mark the
grand reopening of the stadium.
Celtic's problems centre on their proposals to use the Celtic Walkway
as the way in and out of the stand for around half the fans. Strathclyde
Police say the route is tortuous, the walkway is not in good condition,
and there is a strong potential for ''crushing and conflict''.
Chief superintendent George Burton, Divisional Commander of E Division
at London Road police station, said that in his opinion it was unsafe.
''If there was any kind of disorder in the walkway, I would have to plan
for that and it is not safe for police and stewards to be put in a
static position there. As match commander, I must be able to police the
match safely.
''Around 12,000 fans would require to use the Celtic Walkway and that,
in my opinion, as it stands, is unsafe.''
Mr Burton said the safety certificate would not necessarily be
withheld if Celtic failed to get permission to use Janefield Street.
''The terms of the certificate could be altered to reduce the crowd if
we felt we had to bring them all in through the Celtic Walkway.''
The East End club's biggest problem is that they were granted their
original planning permission on the basis that Janefield Street was not
used for access. Overturning that condition now appears to be their only
hope of countering the police objection.
A new planning application asking for a variation has now been
submitted to the city council and has sparked a major campaign of
opposition from local residents.
More than 100 letters of objection to the proposal have been lodged
and both the local district councillor and the newly-elected councillor
for the shadow authority have objected.
A spokesman for Glasgow's planning director Mike Hayes said the
application had been received and was being dealt with as rapidly as
possible.
''We have got to balance the question of crowd safety against
residential amenity and we will be processing the variation request as
quickly as we can,'' he added.
Celtic spokeswoman Ms Clare McGee said the problem with access to the
stand ''is one of the issues that are currently under discussion with
the planning department and we are hopeful of it being resolved.'' She
added that the Newcastle game was not scheduled and was only a proposal.
A spokesperson for Janefield Street Tenants' Association said the use
of the street would cause major disruption to the life of residents.
''We have had a year of freedom to live our lives unrestricted while
Celtic were at Hampden and now we're being asked to go back to the way
it was,'' she said.
''We're not knocking Celtic or the fans' enjoyment of their game but
any person with half a brain would say why should we live with this when
there is an alternative. Since the time of the original application,
Celtic Way has been the route and the police didn't object to it then.''
The decision on a safety certificate will be taken by Strathclyde
region's general purposes committee. A spokesman for the region said it
was aware of the police objection and the separate application to use
Janefield Street. ''The decision on whether access to Janefield Street
will be given is solely a matter for the district council,'' he added.

SCOTLAND continued to bask in its warmest weather for years yesterday
with Tulloch Bridge, near Fort William, and Dumfries the hottest spots
at 30C (86F).
Glasgow enjoyed its best day since August 1984 with 29C (84F) while a
row simmered on Colonsay over a Glasgow Weather Centre report that it
had enjoyed its highest temperature yet, 28C (82F). Mr Dougie McGilvray,
84, the island's elder statesman, disputed the claim. He said: ''It was
definitely hotter here in 1948.''
The east coast, including Aberdeen and Edinburgh, was slightly cooler
with temperatures of 21C and 24C respectively. ScotRail said it was
close to rectifying an overhead electrical line problem caused by the
heatwave which had severely disrupted services yesterday from Glasgow
Central Station.
Reports of a drought in parts of Renfrewshire were dismissed by
Strathclyde region. A spokesman said the demand for water by residents
in Kilmacolm, Lochwinnoch, and Johnstone had been ''exceptionally high''
which had affected pressure.
Glasgow Weather Centre forecaster Ms Heather Reid said today would be
the eighth and final day of the heatwave, with the best of the sunshine
in the west.
A full-scale rescue operation was launched in the Firth of Clyde
yesterday after a teenager experienced difficulties while swimming at
Troon beach. James McBarnes, 15, had been on an outing from the Kibble
residential school in Paisley when he went swimming with friends. He
complained of feeling tired and cold and was helped to the shore.
A Royal Navy helicopter landed on the first fairway of Royal Troon
golf course to allow a medical assistant to examine the boy.
As hundreds of people, many visiting Troon for the day as part of the
50th Glasgow taxi drivers' outing for children, looked on, the boy was
carried on a stretcher to the aircraft and flown to Crosshouse Hospital
where he was treated for exhaustion and hypothermia and released.

<HEADLINE>Police escorts called to protect officials forced to run gauntlet in bid to close down hydrants</HEADLINE>

FIRE crews and water board officials in Strathclyde have been forced
to use police escorts after coming under a series of violent attacks
while trying to shut off hydrants set off in the hot weather. In some
incidents axes and other missiles have been thrown by youths.
Strathclyde Firemaster John Jameson said yesterday there had been some
''very serious attacks'' on officials and the ''usual round of attacks''
on firefighters who had shut down thousands of hydrants in the past
week.
More than 700 hydrants were turned on illegally, mainly by youths, in
the east end of Glasgow last weekend.
Firefighters had been called to shut down individual hydrants up to 15
times in the same day.
Water board officials had to dodge axes and other missiles thrown at
them, while firefighters had been forced on several occasions to retreat
to their vehicles and summon police assistance, the fire chief said. In
some cases the fire brigade had requested a police escort before
attending the hydrants.
The incidents had mainly been concentrated in the peripheral Glasgow
housing estates of Easterhouse, Drumchapel, and Castlemilk, and the east
end of the city, according to Mr Jameson, who warned of the potentially
serious consequences of the ''irresponsible action''.
He explained the water supply in many areas, particularly Easterhouse,
was from tanks. If these became drained through misuse of hydrants, a
shortage could result for fire fighters.
''More importantly, contamination could enter an open hydrant and the
mains, which could result in severe health problems for communities when
the water was turned back on.
Appealing to parents to exercise more control over their children's
actions, Mr Jameson commented: ''There is no doubt that lives would be
at risk if we had a good-going fire.
''We are not getting the help from the parents in those areas that we
should be getting. It is not a fun game. It is a very serious situation
for us right now.''
The firemaster made his comments shortly after announcing an all-time
record low in fire deaths in the region, and a substantial reduction in
the number of people who suffered burns. In his report for 1994/95, he
noted deaths fell to 42 in the past year. This compared with more than
90 victims 10 years ago, and a figure above 80 five years ago.
The most pleasing aspect, he said, was the reduction of more than 1000
people who suffered serious burns. Almost 800 people were also rescued
last year.
Mr Jameson said: ''We are not complacent, but these are substantial
reductions. We are very conscious that when young children especially
are burned they go through their whole life carrying the physicial as
well as psychological effects.''
He said the reductions had been secured despite an ever-increasing
operational and administrative workload and severe cuts in funding by
Government.
The number of malicious calls had also been reduced substantially to
6000, from 12,000 the previous year. This was mainly due to new
technology available to trace the calls, although police and community
efforts had also been a factor.
He said the reductions in fire deaths and accidents were principally
due to a five-year fire brigade campaign which had resulted in 75% of
homes in Strathclyde now being fitted with smoke detectors.
Community firefighters had also been appointed to target problem fire
areas, offering advice to those most at risk.
Mr Jameson emphasised that the reductions in fire deaths and injuries
were due in part to a restructuring of the brigade which had seen staff
redeployed from offices to front-line services.
He said Strathclyde was the only fire brigade in the UK to have had
such substantial reductions in deaths and accidents in recent years.
The firemaster rejected a suggestion that the overall downward trend
could have implications for funding, given that the demand on manpower
and vehicles may not be as intense.
He said: ''In England and Wales Government funding is linked in that
way, but in Scotland the procedures are quite different.
''We are looking to continue our current campaign which will reduce
the number of fires and the number of deaths.''
Mr Jameson said the warm weather had brought a vast increase in the
number of forest and heathland fires.
Firefighters attended 300 incidents in Strathclyde on Tuesday alone,
90 of which were quite serious forest fires.

<HEADLINE>Major given boost by poll rating</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister's luck seemed to be on the turn last night as
support for his rival, Mr John Redwood, dwindled and an opinion poll
showed a dramatic increase of 7% in Tory support. Mr Major's personal
rating has also increased by 7%.
It is the best Tory rating for two years. It was taken after the Prime
Minister's daring move to force a leadership contest next Tuesday. It
gave the Major campaign team a big boost on his return to the Commons
from the Cannes summit.
He went straight into action, talking to dithering Tory backbenchers
in his room at the Commons, with the Times/Mori poll in his hand. It may
turn out to be a key weapon to defeat Mr Redwood handsomely on Tuesday.
It coincided with an impressive statement from him in the Commons on
his European dealings in Cannes and a distinct lack of lustre in the
former Welsh Secretary's performance.
His supporters fear that they have not got sufficient backing from
influential Tory backbenchers and that their target of forcing a second
ballot is slipping away. Those who hope that their heroes Michael
Heseltine and Michael Portillo might get a chance of entering the lists
in a second round were also looking glum.
The Major was exploiting this changing situation. They are playing on
a residual anti-Heseltine feeling among right- wing and centre-right
MPs. As for Mr Portillo, a fellow Cabinet Minister said: ''He doesn't
want to be seen as playing second fiddle to Redwood in a first ballot
and losing out to Heseltine should there be a second ballot. What would
Baroness Thatcher say about that?''
This thinking is based on the theory that, should it come to this, a
Heseltine v Portillo battle would go to the President of the Board of
Trade on the grounds of his General Election campaigning skills.
Mr Redwood's campaign yesterday was showing signs of desperation. At
his press conference, he promised that his first Cabinet would cut both
taxes and state spending. This kind of pitch might work with the British
electorate -- but the hard cases on the Tory benches regard it as
''silly bravado''.
Treasury Ministers in the Major team are ramming home the message by
murmuring that they have almost given up trying to cost the Redwood
alternative programme.
Mr Heseltine yesterday could hardly be faulted in his loyalty to the
Prime Minister in a BBC radio interview. He emphasised the need for a
substantial victory for the Prime Minister on Tuesday.
This was being taken two ways at the Commons because if there is not a
substantial victory for Mr Major it is Mr Heseltine's only chance to
make his own play. His supporters have perhaps the worst dilemma.
''If the Redwood intervention in this sorry affair has done nothing
else, it has shifted the argument to the right in the Tory Party,'' said
one of Mr Heseltine's trusties. ''It is very difficult for us to see a
way through here.''
The Portillo people were saying the same thing. There is more talk now
of him biding his time for a few more months, or until after a General
Election, and less talk about how abstentions in the Tuesday vote might
let him in.
The Times/Mori Poll canvassed 1921 adults between June 23 and 26 --
the first opinion poll to sample public reaction to Mr Major's
declaration that he wants his party enemies to ''put up or shut up''.
However, it was largely completed before Mr Redwood resigned from the
Cabinet on Monday.
Tory support has risen since the end of May from 22% to 29% -- the
best result for them since April 1993. Labour's following has slipped a
couple of points to 56% and the Liberal Democrats have dropped three
points to 13%.
The satisfaction rating for Major as Prime Minister has increased from
21% to 28% -- the highest since early 1993 and dissatisfaction has
fallen six points to 64%. Among Tory supporters, his rating has gone up
10 points to 63% since the end of May, while dissatisfaction has fallen
nine points to 30%.
The Prime Minister will be using this as evidence that he is beginning
to have support for his message and his conduct of affairs from the
country.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang has won a battle with Cabinet colleagues
to avoid capping spending by Strathclyde Regional Council. He will
announce the outcome to the Commons today.
He came under heavy pressure from the Treasury and Department of
Environment Ministers to curb Scotland's biggest region, which
threatened court action if the Government acted to restrict its planned
budget.
Environment Secretary John Gummer took the view that if he was
proposing to cap spending by eight English councils Strathclyde, whose
estimated overspend was #5m more than all of theirs put together, should
not be allowed to escape. He was backed by Chief Secretary to the
Treasury Jonathan Aitken.
Strathclyde warned that capping would mean the loss of jobs and cuts
in services.
The region sent out its council tax bills in April to a million
households. If capping had gone ahead new bills would have had to be
sent out at a cost of #300,000.
Mr Lang argued that would be a waste of money and that months of
friction with Strathclyde would hinder the smooth transition to unitary
local authorities within the region.
Whitehall sources are reportedly annoyed but Mr Lang was helped by the
fact that Mr Gummer eventually went for less severe caps on English
councils than he had first contemplated.
Strathclyde would have been forced to cut spending by #107m.
It planned to try to move around #45m from capital spending into
services to soften the blow but job losses and a freeze on filling
vacancies would have been needed to bring it within the new target.

<HEADLINE>Government action on council jobs controversy gives Conservatives rare chance to upstage Labour.  Lang orders a full Monklands inquiry</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang last night announced a full-scale
statutory inquiry into the activities of Monklands District Council.
Beginning later this year, it will focus on the council's appointments
procedure and practice and is likely to be headed by a senior legal
figure, who has yet to be appointed. The evidence is expected to be
taken in public and the inquiry will be able to summon witnesses and ask
to see documents and accounts as it deems appropriate.
The announcement came as Labour's national executive committee met to
extend the suspensions on Monklands councillors to include the role of
those also sitting on the new North Lanarkshire unitary authority and to
confirm the party would press ahead with its own inquiry into the
affair.
This was instantly upstaged by the Government. Mr Lang's announcement,
which came during Scottish Questions in the Commons yesterday, stunned
MPs and caused uproar. It followed the report earlier this month from
Professor Robert Black, which upheld claims of nepotism and spending
bias in the council.
Mr Lang told the Commons yesterday: ''I have considered the contents
of Professor Black's report very carefully. On the basis of its
contents, I have concluded that, in principle, there is now a case for
initiating a statutory inquiry.
''This will concentrate on the allegations that the council failed to
comply with the statutory obligation on it under section seven of the
Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to appoint staff on merit.''
In the Commons yesterday, Speaker Betty Boothroyd frequently had to
call for order as Tory MPs fired barbed comments at their Labour
opponents following Mr Lang's announcement. With the Conservative Party
in disarray, Monklands has provided them with a rare chance to hit back
at Labour.
Labour's line, put forward by a furious Monklands East MP Helen
Liddell, the successor in the constituency to the party's late leader Mr
John Smith, was that it had been calling for such an inquiry for years
but the Government had refused and was now using Monklands as a
political football.
Mrs Liddell, who faced heckling from the Tory benches but was given
full rein by the Speaker, said: ''It was my distinguished predecessor
who first called for an inquiry and I am shocked by the action of the
Government in delaying it for this length of time.''
She said that shortly after her by-election a year ago, the then
Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart -- ''before he fell on his
pick-axe'' -- had pointedly refused to institute an inquiry.
The Scottish Secretary retorted that he understood Labour had wanted
him to set up an inquiry. During the Monklands East by-election, he had
asked Mrs Liddell to send him the evidence she had. Earlier, he had
asked Mr Smith to send him details of Labour's internal inquiry. Neither
had done so.
''However, as a result of Professor Black's report, we do have further
information which we have considered very carefully and that has led me
to the conclusion I have just announced,'' said Mr Lang.
Labour MPs reacted furiously when Mr Stewart told Mr Lang to recognise
there was ''nothing terribly unusual about Monklands''. He said most
Labour councils in the West of Scotland behaved in exactly the same way
and he pressed Mr Lang to bear in mind the possibility of holding
inquiries into others, ''particularly Dumbarton and Renfrew''.
Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond told Mr Lang: ''While
nobody will take seriously Labour's attempt to abdicate its
responsibility for Monklands, there is a question as to why it has taken
two years for you to take the action you have announced today.
''Is it the case that it was the policy of past and present Scottish
Office Ministers deliberately to allow the Monklands situation to fester
for political advantage, just as it was the policy of the Labour Party
to try to sweep it under the carpet?''
Mr Lang replied: ''That is quite wrong. I have been aware of certain
allegations for some time but I am obliged to consider the situation in
its statutory context. I now am of the opinion that it is appropriate to
initiate an inquiry of the kind I have announced.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, who was called last in the
exchanges, said the announcement had been ''slipped in'' at question
time, and added: ''This is the usual sleekit way we expect these things
to be announced from the Tory Party today.
''It was left to the Labour Party to call for Professor Black's
independent inquiry and, in contrast to the dilly-dallying of you and
the Scottish Office, we took action on it within 24 hours.''
In a statement issued at Westminster last night, Mr Robertson
emphasised that Mr Lang must now say why it had taken him so long to
act.
The Liberal Democrats' Scottish leader, Orkney and Shetland MP Jim
Wallace, said: ''Mr Lang has behaved in a wholly opportunistic way,
delaying the inquiry to milk as much political capital out of it as
possible and, in the meantime, neglects his duty to the citizens of
Monklands.''

A TOP British doubles pair were last night disqualified from Wimbledon
over an incident in which a ball girl was struck on the side of the head
with a tennis ball.
Jeremy Bates and Tim Henman are believed to be the first players
disqualified from the championships in the Open era, after a flare-up in
the final match of the day.
Their match with Swede Henrik Holm and American Jeff Tarango was
locked at 6-6 in the fourth set when Oxford's Henman missed a crucial
net cord and hit a ball in anger.
Ball girl Caroline Hall had run on to court to retrieve a ball when
Henman let fly, hitting her on the ear from close range. She fell to the
ground but then got up and walked back to her position in tears.
Henman walked over and asked how she was but when she was helped back
to a spot beneath the umpire's chair, she was still rubbing the ear and
crying. A doctor and tournament referee Alan Mills were summoned to
court 14 by Australian professional umpire Wayne McKewen, who announced
that Henman had been defaulted for a code violation.
Caroline received ice treatment and was then taken home.
Henman, a 20-year-old Davis Cup international, had been beaten earlier
in the day by American champion Pete Sampras in the singles.
Later, he said: ''I am a little shocked. It was a complete accident.
As soon as the ball hit her, I had an idea I might be defaulted.''
Only American John McEnroe, in the 1990 Australian Open, and German
Karsten Arriens, in the French Open this year, have been disqualified in
Grand Slam events.

TWO men were in custody last night and are expected to appear at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court today as detectives continue to investigate the
death of a man whose charred remains were found beneath a derelict tower
block in Leith.
His body was found by firemen called to the block of flats in the
port's Lindsay Road, believing they had been alerted to extinguish a
pile of burning debris.
Later, as a post- mortem examination was being held, they said he had
been identified and they were treating his death as murder. A spokesman
for Lothian and Borders police said his name would be withheld until
relatives had been informed.
The man's body was found by a security guard patrolling the area,
which was a vacant but sealed site. Yesterday, detectives visited nearby
pubs and checked security videos from local flats in the hunt for
possible clues.
Meanwhile, the district council yesterday gave the go-ahead for the
#7m refurbishment of the block of flats, Grampian House, and the
adjoining Cairngorm House, which were bought from the council by private
developer Muirfield Glen Ltd. The flats have been empty for four years.
