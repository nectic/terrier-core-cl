<HEADLINE>The high price to pay for rail lives Union claims safety system rejected as too costly</HEADLINE>

FIVE out of six rail accidents in which 48 people have died and more
than 1000 injured would have been preventable by the Automatic Train
Protection system, shelved by Railtrack as being ''too costly'',
according to a union.
The system had been recommended by a report into the Clapham disaster
of 1988.
The loco drivers' union, Aslef, made the case for ATP at the resumed
public inquiry into last October's head-on crash on a single track in
fog at Cowden, Kent, in which five people were killed.
Aslef maintains the Cowden accident would have been avoided with ATP
as would those at Bellgrove, Glasgow, and Purley in March 1989; Cannon
Street in January 1991; and Newton, Lanarkshire, in July 1991.
Railtrack has advised the Health and Safety Executive that ATP, which
automatically curbs trains' speeds or stops them altogether if limits
are exceeded or danger signals passed, would cost about #600m and equate
to about #14m per life saved.
Aslef counsel, Mr Allan Gore, urged Major Kit Holden, assistant chief
inspecting officer of railways, to recommend that the Government gives
the go-ahead and funding for an ATP system covering the busiest 30% of
the rail network and some 80% of passenger miles.
Despite constant recommendations to adopt ATP, there continued to be
accidents which would have been prevented had money been spent, said Mr
Gore. It is available on many European railway systems, he said. It is
in use on Eurostar trains in France but not when they run from the
Channel Tunnel to Waterloo.
Aslef is also demanding radio phones and data recorders in every loco
cab and strongly urging the inquiry to recommend the complete removal of
single lines on the route concerned.
Pointing out that over the past five years there have been collisions
at four locations, including Bellgrove, where double lines or junctions
have been singled, Aslef says it ''cannot conceive of a more blatant
example of safety being subjugated to commercial considerations''.
Mr James Watson, counsel for BR, denied that those who managed the
system were responsible for a ''knowing and deliberate cost-driven
failure to make effective safety provision''. He said: ''To say they in
some way regard loss of life of drivers and passengers to be 'affordable
and acceptable' is both irresponsible and untrue.''
To say or imply that cost benefit analysis represented an abdication
of responsibility was rubbish and a slur on their integrity. ''In short,
breach of promise is a sterile allegation to make. It is hardly a breach
of promise for the board to attempt, responsibly, to prioritise
investment so as to ensure continued progress.''
The inquiry is expected to report in the spring.

A RETIRED bank clerk left almost #2m in his will, it was revealed
yesterday, and the National Westminster Bank has been appointed to
administer the estate.
Mr Stanley Oulton Brown, who died on September 17 last year, lived
modestly in a semi-detached house in Childwall Park Avenue, Liverpool.
But his will published yesterday shows that Mr Brown leaves an estate
valued at #1,995,011 gross (#1,932,876 net).
His surprised former neighbours believed Mr Brown worked for the
NatWest as a broker and there was speculation that he may have amassed
his fortune ''playing the markets''.
They described Mr Brown as ''a nice old chap'' and said he had been in
his late nineties when he died. He lived alone.
He had suffered from arthritis for some time, leaving him virtually
housebound and reliant on a home help, although he was occasionally seen
getting in and out of taxis.
It was thought he had family in Wales.
A spokesman for the National Westminster Bank said he was unable to
confirm whether Mr Brown was an ex-employee because of client and
employee confidentiality rules.

TONY Stanger, who dared to say no to the international rugby
selectors, has been recalled to Scotland's colours for the A game
against Ireland at Myreside a week today.
After 36 caps, the Hawick wing, the Scots' second top try-scorer of
all time with 16, announced he only wished to be considered as a centre
in future.
He had relented to play on the wing against the Springboks, but had
made it clear he was determined to switch positions. Left on the
sidelines for the Canadian match, he now lines up in a centre
partnership with another ''reject,'' Scott Hastings -- two men with but
one point to prove.
''Tony had a good district championship,'' said team manager Arthur
Hastie, ''and, as this is the final A international, we felt it was fair
to give him a run at this level.''
Stanger, still only 26, was delighted. ''Making the World Cup squad is
my target, so any chance I have to impress the selectors I will gladly
accept.''
The other recall is for ''forgotten man'' Derek Stark, capped four
times in 1993 and virtually ignored since. He has forced his way back
into contention with 25 tries so far this season, five of them in one
match for Boroughmuir.
There are six changes in all from the A side beaten 13-9 by France
last week. Stanger is in for Ronnie Eriksson and Stark for Sale's Mark
Appleson.
The front row is re-cast. Alan Sharp, eager to prove his fitness,
takes over from John Manson, Orrell hooker Martin Scott, pardoned after
having been sent off three weeks ago, replaces Jim Hay, and Alan Kittle
is in for Danny Herrington.
In the only other alteration, Melrose's Doddie Weir, who hopes to
resume tomorrow, displaces the rather unlucky Stuart Reid.
Scotland A -- R J S Shepherd (Edinburgh Academicals); H R Gilmour
(Heriot's FP), A G Stanger (Hawick), S Hastings (Watsonians), D A Stark
(Boroughmuir); S R Laing (Instonians), G G Burns (Stewart's Melville
FP); A V Sharp (Bristol), M W Scott (Orrell), A J Kittle (Stewart's
Melville FP), J F Richardson (Edinburgh Academicals), captain, R Scott
(London Scottish), F D Wallace (GHK), G W Weir (Melrose), I R Smith
(Gloucester).
Replacements -- M Dods (Gala), D W Hodge (Watsonians), K Troup (London
Scottish), S J Reid (Boroughmuir), A G J Watt (GHK), J A Hay (Hawick).

FREE. Free at last. Neither Alex Cleland nor Gary Bollan ran up
Tannadice Street shouting this message at the top of their voices, but
there is little doubt both players felt relieved to be getting away from
Dundee United and absolutely thrilled at the prospect of playing for
Rangers.
Walter Smith made his double signing for a cost of only #750,000,
which constitutes a decent afternoon's work since Bollan is a current
Scottish under-21 internationalist and Cleland a former regular in the
same side, and, although it appears Rangers have secured the best part
of the deal, United will not be too unhappy, either.
They were to be taken to court by Bollan, who through the Scottish
Professional Footballers' Association, was disputing the legality of his
contract.
He had signed a four-year deal with an option clause of similar
length, which meant he was facing a further four years at Tannadice.
Cleland already had done his eight years, but both say they are now
looking forward to the challenge of securing a first-team place with a
team which is much bigger than anything they have ever known.
They have signed on at Ibrox for the remainder of this season and then
three full seasons more and Smith expects to get good service from both.
Cleland, regarded by many as the brighter prospect of the two, said:
''It is up to us now that we have been given this chance to prove we are
good enough to play in this team.''
They certainly will find the atmosphere within Ibrox different from
what they have become accustomed to inside Tannadice, where relations
have been strained in recent times, and, as they sat on either side of
their new manager yesterday, both were still trying to come to terms
with the dramatic change which circumstances effected.
They were training as normal yesterday morning when United chairman
Jim McLean arrived on the scene and told them they had to go back to
Tannadice.
''On the way back he told us we were wanted by Rangers,'' Cleland
said. ''It was sudden and we had no idea. We have been given the chance
of a lifetime.''
Smith asked about Cleland earlier in the week and was told he and
Bollan were available, and, if you were a cynic, you might say United
would have been happy to have Bollan included in the deal in order to
end the controversy which has settled over them because of their
practice of using option clauses. Now, it is believed, only four players
remain on long-term contracts at Tannadice.
For once, a transaction between Rangers and United has gone smoothly
with Smith saying business between himself and McLean was
straightforward. Although it appears McLean was the one doing business
at United's end, their manager, Ivan Golac, was trying hard last night
to spend the new money.
''If I bring off one of the deals I am working on, it would be a
fantastic signing for Dundee United,'' he said.
Golac arranged for a Portuguese defender to fly in on Wednesday and
added: ''The player will be with us until next Thursday and I will have
a look at him when we play a second-team game against Aberdeen at
Pittodrie.''

ERIC Cantona, who shocked and shamed British football with his attack
on a Crystal Palace supporter, stands on the verge of losing it all, but
he might be the only one unconcerned by the trouble he has caused or
even the dreadful consequences which might have to be confronted.
Yesterday, the FA charged the Frenchman with misconduct and bringing
the game into disrepute, and while all manner of experts were trotted
out to comment and pass judgment, the Gallic superstar was behaving as
though nothing had happened.
Indeed, it was as though Cantona was starting a new day and that
anything which had gone before was now of little, or no, significance.
The frenzy of controversy whipped up in the wake of his rush of blood to
the head at Selhurst Park where he lunged into the crowd after having
been ordered off for kicking out at an opponent was of interest to
others.
He was busy buying a replica United shirt -- No.7, of course, and with
his name on the back -- for his seven-year-old son while his sanity was
being questioned by a former team-mate, and the president of the French
Football Federation was suggesting Cantona would not play again for his
country.
Sheffield Wednesday's England internationalist Chris Waddle, who
played with Cantona for a season at Marseilles in the late 1980s,
suggested that the United star might need psychiatric help. ''He is a
genius, but there's this other side of him,'' Waddle said.
''Maybe he needs help, I don't know. Maybe he needs someone to examine
him, a psychiatrist or somebody.
''If you go too strong on him he might walk away from it. That's the
type of lad he used to be. He quit in France and there's no reason why
he won't quit here.''
Cantona, who has been sent off five times in Britain, now faces an
automatic three-game suspension, which will begin on February 8 as the
precurser to the FA's full wrath, banishment into the international
wilderness by the FFF, and possible police action.
However, Manchester United were painfully slow yesterday to condemn
their manchild but they, too, must hand down punishment for their own
good, and for the sake of the game.
The player ignored the press gang camped outside his home in
Boothstown, near Bolton, when he got into his car and drove off without
comment around 10am yesterday morning for a meeting behind locked doors
at United's Salford training ground with manager Alex Ferguson.
Later, Cantona took reporters by surprise by appearing at the club's
new Megastore were he bought the replica United shirt.
''It was just the normal Eric,'' said a member of staff. ''He was as
cool as a cucumber, you would have thought nothing had happened. He
walked round as if he did not have a care in the world.''
Was this the behaviour of a man fully aware of what was going on, or
of someone weighed down by remorse?
FFF president Claude Simonet said his national team captain may have
won the last of his 45 caps. ''Eric Cantona was captain yesterday, but I
can't say if he will be tomorrow,'' Simonet said. ''It seems to be
incompatible after an action such as that.''
Even Cantona himself has talked of his darker side. ''I play with
passion and fire,'' he says on his video, ''Eric the King.''
''I have to accept that sometimes the fire does harm. I harm myself
and I am aware of harming others.''
Cantona has 14 days in which to respond to the FA charge before an
association commission decide what further action to take, but FA chief
executive Graham Kelly said the ''unprecedented'' incident involving
Cantona during United's 1-1 Premiership draw at Selhurst Park was ''a
stain on the game.''
Kelly went on: ''This has brought shame on those involved and the game
itself. We especially deplore the example set to young supporters, who
are the game's future.''
Scotland Yard said Cantona and Paul Ince, who it is suggested has been
caught up in the controversy, had not yet been interviewed but would be
questioned ''in due course.''
A spokesman also confirmed that two Crystal Palace fans had given
statements at South Norwood police station alleging assault. One
spectator alleges assault by Cantona, the other assault by Ince.
Cantona could be caught up in a scenario similar to that which allows
Duncan Ferguson to play for Everton until the end of the season. If
criminal charges are brought against Cantona it would be unlikely any
further FA punishment could be enforced until after legal proceedings
have been concluded.
If so, that could free Cantona to play in the remainder of United's
chase for a second successive league-and-cup double, but that really
would be unacceptable to decent-minded people.
Ferguson's alleged assault on Raith Rovers' defender John McStay in a
match last April was also caught on television film. The SFA went ahead
with the case in Ferguson's absence last summer and announced a record
12-match ban, which was later suspended until after the trial.

FIVE players, four of them from Bordeaux, have been banned for up to
two months after they were involved in a fight during a first division
match at St Etienne last week.
Bordeaux captain Didier Senac was suspended until March 31 for beating
and kicking St Etienne's Piotr Swierczewski. The 36-year-old former
France defender had already been fined around #6000 by his club.
Swierczewski, who started the punch-up by hitting Bordeaux playmaker
Zinedine Zidane, was banned until March 15. Bordeaux's international
striker Christophe Dugarry and defender Bixente Lizarazu were suspended
for four and three matches respectively, while young forward Frank
Histilloles was banned for one.

STIRLING County are not only top of the national league, but they also
have the luxury of being able to chose their back-row trio from four
district players.
Of course, someone must suffer when all are available and tomorrow,
Gordon Mackay is the unlucky man for the Bridgehaugh match against GHK.
Mackay's omission allows Stirling to accommodate both district No.8
forwards, Jim Brough and Gareth Flockhart, with Brough in his Glasgow
position, flanked by Flockhart and Brian Ireland.
West of Scotland, visiting Currie, keep two Glasgow Under-21 squad
members, Alan Hogarth and David Jamieson, in a team unchanged despite
the 22-21 defeat by Glasgow Academicals at New Anniesland last week.
Hogarth, normally a scrum-half, remains on the left wing in place of
Stuart Munro, and Jamieson is again preferred tight head to Sandy Crear.
Stewart's Melville have dropped their regular full back Murray Thomson
for the visit to Edinburgh Academicals, with Peter Flockhart switching
from centre, a good chance for him to warm up for wearing the No.15
jersey in the Under-21 international against Ireland next week.
Last week Jed brought Alan Dunnett and David Forster into the pack for
the friendly against Hartlepool Rovers, and so well did the pair played
that day that they remain for the home league match against Dundee.
However, a worry for Jed is that Bob Johnstone has a trapped nerve in
his back and now Kevin Barrie has had to shift from hooker to left prop
in a recast front row.
Melrose who have lost four of their nine matches, need a win against
Heriot's at the Greenyards. Robin Craig returns at loose head for
Melrose as Millan Browne is still troubled by injury, and Ian Cornwall,
a schools cap last year, is being rested.
Hawick take on Gala by fielding the team who finished in the 14-10
victory over Stirling two weeks ago, the league leaders' first
championship defeat of the season. Stewart Henderson, an early
replacement in that match, remains in the second row.
* ST Mungo Turnbull, from Bishopbriggs, have been successful in
appealing to the Scottish Rugby Union against a two-point penalty in the
first division of the RMD Glasgow and District League.
The league committee had decreed that the points should be forfeited
as the club, because of suspension, had had to postpone their opening
league game of the season, against Strathclyde Police, in September.
St Mungo Turnbull had been banned for fielding a suspended player in a
match last season, but the SRU ruled that the two-point league penalty
would be a double punishment.

In Manila
OLD irons proved better than new as Sam Torrance shot a 71 in
yesterday's Johnnie Walker Classic at the Orchard Club, but a violent
sneeze left Colin Montgomerie complaining of back problems after an
opening 73.
Torrance, who abandoned a new set of irons after starting the season
with a 75 in last week's Desert Classic and failed to avoid missing the
cut by four strokes, yesterday used his old clubs to carve out a much
more characteristic one-under-par score. He would have matched Matt
Hallberg's pace-setting 69 but for two fluffed four-footers for birdies.
Hallberg, who finished seventh on the Challenge Tour last year, led by
one stroke from Scotland's Andrew Coltart, another casualty in Dubai,
Paul Eales, fellow Swede Joakim Haeggman, Italy's Silvio Grappasonni,
and Malaysian Marimuthu Ramayah on a day of high winds which saw only 12
players better the par of 72.
Montgomerie managed only one birdie after a bizarre accident left him
with a back spasm. Of the sneeze that laid him low, he said: ''It
happened in my hotel room and put my back out. I was okay breathing out,
but every time I breathed in the pain went right through my back and it
gradually worked its way up my spine.
''It didn't affect my swing and I'm hoping to be okay after a good
night's rest.''
World No.1 Nick Price had five birdies in a 71, defending champion
Greg Norman matched Fred Couples' 72, Severiano Ballesteros joined
Montgomerie four strokes off the lead, and Ernie Els slipped to a 78
with a 7 at the last -- and joined the chorus of criticism of the new
Arnold Palmer-designed course, with its rock-hard greens and tricky
Bermuda rough surrounds.
Torrance collected three birdies from inside 12 feet, but admitted:
''It's a keep your head on week. There are so many tricky shots you have
no chance of pulling off -- you've got to settle for the best you can.''
Coltart collected five birdies, hitting a No.3-iron shot to 12 feet
for a 2 at the fifth, a 160-yard pitch to a foot at the fifteenth, and a
5-iron to 10 feet at the seventeenth.
That edged him three under par but, to use his own words, ''a comedy
of errors'' cost him a 6 at the eighteenth, where he pulled his second
within a few feet of a stone wall, shanked his next into sand, found
another bunker with his recovery and ended having to make a brave
eight-footer to drop only one stroke.

THE English football authorities acted swiftly, but must take into
account any action the police may consider concerning Manchester
United's seriously flawed genius, Eric Cantona, who shamed the game the
other night when he lunged towards the crowd at Selhurst Park.
In front of thousands of decent supporters -- many of whom would have
been impressionable children -- he appeared to kick and then punch a
supporter, who would have been dragged off to the jailhouse had he been
the perpetrator.
Yet, Cantona was allowed to go home, although he will have to help the
police with their enquiries at some point. It is, perhaps, this
leniency, often shown by the law towards sporting personalities, which
may have encourged some performers to adopt the notion that they can
live by a different set of rules.
Wednesday night brought an alarming display of violence from someone
welcomed in by the game's customers. It was an incident which now should
bring to an end his controversial career in English football.
Indeed, Manchester United's manager, Alex Ferguson, who has just given
Newcastle United #6m and Keith Gillespie to bring Andy Cole to Old
Trafford to form a partnership with Cantona, should seize the initiative
and tell the Frenchman entente cordiale is at an end.
No sportsperson can be allowed to believe he or she can ignore common
decency, and if football wants to portray the correct image to its
public and its sponsors, Cantona should never play major league again in
this country.
It will be impossible for United to concentrate fully on football in
the weeks ahead and that might just throw the advantage to Kenny
Dalglish's Blackburn Rovers, who suddenly have become an even more
attractive bet for the title. If United do fail to win their third
successive championship, it could cost them the #7m which can be
generated in the European Champions' League.
However, United -- or to be more exact, their shareholders -- are
already paying a price for Cantona's grotesque reaction to the sort of
verbal abuse which most high-profile footballers attract. Yesterday
morning, the value of United's shares fell from 133p to 124p and,
according to Bill McCall, a director of Tilney Stockbrokers, who has
moved shares around for some clubs, the drop is a reaction to the
incident involving Cantona.
United and Tottenham Hotspur are quoted on the full list, and share
prices fluctuate depending on the behaviour of the clubs and their
employees on and off the field. Another of Cantona's now infamous rages
appears to be costing the club already, but while it might eventually be
possible to put a precise figure on the financial loss, it may be
impossible to gauge the damage done to a great club.
Ferguson and his directors must indulge in a damage limitation
exercise -- they must be seen to be outraged by what has happened. If
they choose to pay him off, they may restore some of their credibility.
It would be wrong now of anyone at Old Trafford to defend Cantona, who
has been sent off five times since signing for United in 1992. He also
left behind a record of indiscipline in France, and although he is an
exquisite footballer, he has become a luxury and a liability.
Ferguson, who defended him after he had been sent off in a pre-season
friendly against Rangers at Ibrox, should not make that kind of mistake
any more.
Chest inflated and collar turned up, Cantona promotes the image of an
urbane intellectual who is interested in psychology and enjoys dabbling
in painting and poetry. It would be interesting to see his work, which
you might reasonably assume, given the number of times Cantona has
short-circuited, to be sweeping and heavy brush strokes and deep and
angry reds. There seems to be a weakness within.
During a match against Crystal Palace, he was shown a red card after
having kicked Richard Shaw, but he could not go quietly. Selhurst Park
is tight, with the fans close to the pitch, and it was inevitable as he
walked towards the dressing room that Palace supporters would ridicule
him.
Perhaps given Cantona's record of indiscipline and violent conduct, it
was inevitable he would react. His lunge into the front row, boot up,
was the act of more than a petulant, wealthy sportsman. It may have been
the act of an enfant terrible.
Football's image has been blackened by allegations of sleaze and
corruption and it simply cannot afford Cantona.
He has spoken about his need to play football his own way, but even
though he said he could derive some satisfaction from making fans happy,
he warned that there could be times when there would be black flashes,
''dark stains.'' Clearly, he can add looking into the future to his list
of talents.
Perhaps Cantona will pre-empt everyone and retire from the game of his
own free will. He did it in France, where he could not come to terms
with laws.
He was suspended from the French national side in 1988 after he called
the then manager, Henri Michel, a ''sack of manure.'' A year later he
was suspended indefinitely by Marseille, who paid Auxerre #2m for him,
after kicking a ball into the crowd and throwing his shirt at a referee.
He was loaned to Bordeaux and then sold to Montpellier for #300,000,
but returned to Marseille in 1990. He lasted only a year and signed for
Nimes, but was not long there when he threw a ball at a referee and was
suspended for three games.
He did not care much for the code of conduct and told the disciplinary
committee they were ''a bunch of idiots.'' The ban was extended to two
months and Cantona said he would not be treated in this manner and
announced his retirement.
A year later he found his way into English football, but in typical
fashion, there was controversy. He was on trial with Sheffield
Wednesday, but walked out after having been asked to do an extra week.
Leeds United took him for #900,000, and he helped them win the
championship, which alerted United. They bought him for #1.2m, and
although he won championsip medals with them it was the start of a
stormy period which led us all to Selhurst Park.
In purely football terms, Cantona may be priceless, but it is
impossible to buy one part of him. He may well be up for sale again, but
he comes warts and all. That, I suggest, makes the current English
Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year unmarketable.
Cantona
career
count
1966: Born Paris, May 24, but raised in Marseille.
1983: Makes professional debut for Auxerre.
1985: Loaned to Martigues.
1987: Receives heavy fine for punching his team's keeper, giving him a

FALKIRK manager Jim Jefferies has selected Port Vale striker Joe Allan
as the third part of his #400,000 bid to secure premier division safety.
The defensive element will be in place today, when Aberdeen defender
David Winnie completes a #100,000 move to Brockville, and the Falkirk
manager is still determed to prise former Scotland midfield player Gary
Mackay away from Hearts, which will take #150,000 out of the kitty.
* ABERDEEN have been dealt a heavy double blow on the eve of their
Scottish Cup campaign with the news that striker Scott Booth and
defender Colin Woodthorpe have been ruled out for some time because of
injury.
Booth, absent since having scored the goal which earned Scotland a
draw with Russia in the European Championships in November, will now
miss the return in Moscow on March 29. A complete rest has has failed to
clear up his groin injury.
Woodthorpe has been unable to train, because of a back injury, for
almost two months.

BARCELONA yesterday found themselves in deep water with the Catalan
regional government -- but under very strange circumstances.
The Spanish champions were fined #1300 after a club official killed a
hare which ran across the pitch during a game. The fine was imposed
under animal protection laws for an incident in March, when Barcelona
were playing Atletico Madrid at the Nou Camp stadium.
The hare, apparently let loose by a spectator, raced on to the pitch,
evaded the lunges of players, but was caught by an official who, in view
of 90,000 fans and millions of television viewers, killed it -- with a
rabbit punch.

SPANIARD Carlos Sainz yesterday won the Monte Carlo rally after
risking all to notch up his second victory in the gambling capital.
Sainz, who entered the last night with a fragile lead of 12 seconds
over defending champion Francois Delecour, put up a scary performance to
take the season's opening event.
Hair-raising skids on treacherous roads in the mountains overlooking
the principality allowed the Subaru driver to end the race two minutes
25 seconds ahead of the Frenchman, who was hampered by mechanical
problems to his Ford Escort.
''The only option was to attack and that's just what I did,'' said
Sainz. ''You can't win here if you don't take risks.''
Under controversial new rules limiting mechanical assistance, Delecour
was unable to do any repairs to a broken shock absorber and lost time --
as well as his temper.
''These new rules are absolute nonsense,'' he snapped. ''They're
killing rallies.''
Delecour said the changes could force him out of world championship
competition.
''Considering the direction rallies are heading, I don't think I will
stay long,'' said Delacour.
''Rallies as they are today don't make me dream anymore and maybe next
year, I will try cross-country rallies.'' Leading final standings:
1, C Sainz (Spain) Subaru Impreza, 6hr 32min 31sec; 2, F Delecour
(France) Ford Escort, at 2min 25sec; 3, J Kankkunen (Finland) Toyota
Celica, 3-57; 4, T Makinen (Finland) Mitsubishi Lancer, 4-41; 5, B Thiry

Subaru Impreza, 37-23; 9, P Camandona (France) Ford Escort, 40-30; 10, I
Holderied (Germany) Mitsubishi Lancer, 41-83.

STEVE Davis took the long, winding road into the semi-final stage of
the Regal Welsh Snooker Open in Newport yesterday, labouring for four
hours 17 minutes before defeating Mark Flowerdew 5-3.
''It wasn't pretty,'' said Davis. ''In this case the result is the
main thing. When it gets like that you think about trying to force the
pace. But sometimes that can backfire.''
Davis started well with an opening-frame break of 72 that turned out
to be his best of the match.
Flowerdew, ranked No.84 in the world, then slipped 3-0 behind. But the
man from Hampshire opened his account in the final frame before the
mid-session interval.
Boosted by his success, Flowerdew potted pink and black to bring the
score back to 3-2, only for Davis to restore his two-frame cushion after
a 45-minute sixth frame.
Back came Flowerdew again but needing the colours to prolong the game,
he gifted the final yellow and Davis cleared up.
''When you get two players not going for the 50-50 balls you're bound
to get tough matches,'' said Davis. ''Certainly, nobody is going to beat
Mark easily because he has such a tactical game.''
While Davis now faces Peter Ebdon tomorrow, Flowerdew heads home with
a #5000 consolation cheque.
In the evening match, Ebdon just got the better of Irishman Joe Swail,
the Englishman winning 5-4, but this was a match that fluctuated
greatly, although Swail was never in front. Results and frame scores:
S Davis (England) beat M Flowerdew (England) 5-3. Frames (Davis first)
-- 100-8, 70-36, 99-1, 38-81, 45-58, 55-13, 7-50, 83-39.
P Ebdon (England) beat J Swail (N Ireland) 5-4. Frames (Ebdon first)
-- 25-67, 71-41, 99-0, 27-79, 92-0, 42-78, 79-24, 16-93, 86-18.

NICK Faldo, after having incurred a penalty stroke when a ball he was
addressing on the second green was moved half a turn by a strong wind,
scored a first round 71 on the par 71, 6992-yard Stadium course on the
opening day of the Phoenix Open yesterday.
The incident occurred at his second hole, the 469-yard eleventh, where
he pitched from 60-yards to seven feet.
Faldo settled down and addressed the par-saving putt. Suddenly, he
stepped back hurriedly and walked over to his partner, Paul Azinger.
A rules official was called and, upon Faldo explaining that his ball
had moved, the Briton was penalised a shot. He holed out bravely enough
but that was a 5 instead of a 4.
Out in 37 in a very strong wind, Faldo settled down on his inward
stretch and got to level par with a 15-footer at the 150-yard fourth. He
missed from nine feet at the sixth, from four feet at the eighth, and
from eight feet on his last green, the ninth, to stand no fewer than
seven strokes behind the unexpected leader, Duffy Waldorf, who shot a 64
in the calm of the early morning. Leaders (US unless stated):
64 -- D Waldorf. 66 -- H Irwin. 67 -- G Burns, J Furyk, B Lohr, T

SHANE Warne knocked England out of their stride at Adelaide Oval early
yesterday -- then Mike Gatting and John Crawley -- the last of England's
front-line batsmen -- set about repairing the damage.
Australia's No 1 leg-spinner, wicketless on the opening day of the
fourth Test, needed only another three overs to make his mark. Graham
Thorpe, having taken two boundaries off Warne while moving confidently
to 26, edged a delivery low to Mark Taylor at first slip.
It was only a gentle leg-break and England's left-handed batsman was
barely playing a shot. That wicket made the tourists 211 for three --
and guaranteed a tense morning session.
But Gatting and Crawley got their heads down, and with the former
England skipper edging upwards after his unbeaten overnight half
century, the tourists ploughed their way towards the 250 mark.
England had resumed on 196 for two, having battled superbly yesterday
through Mike Atherton (80), Graham Gooch (47) and Mike Gatting's 50.
Thorpe raised the tempo by fetching Warne from outside off stump for a
boundary wide of mid-wicket and he later cut the spinner for another 4.
But Warne was already turning the ball more than at any time on the
first day, and his reward came through Thorpe's snick to slip.
Gatting has shown fighting spirit, and the same can be said of
41-year-old Graham Gooch, who might by now have been celebrating his own
half-century -- or something even better.
He hit 47 in the first-wicket stand of 93 with Atherton before losing
a debatable decision to Damien Fleming. An attempted hook ended with the
ball hitting his helmet and lobbing to slip, but umpire Peter Parker saw
or heard an edge as well. Gooch looked bitterly disappointed as he
trudged off. Scoreboard:

Jim Hewitson in his Scotching the Myth series very commendably
features the Scottish Radical Revolt of 1820 (Weekender, January 14).
This significant event in modern Scotland's political history is by no
means as ''sadly . . . forgotten'' as he seems to imagine.
The 1820 Society on whose behalf I write in fact exists for the
express purpose of commemorating this admittedly abortive radical
rising, whose leaders were ruthlessly scapegoated by the Scottish
establishment of the time on account of their radical political ideals.
The society carries out its central function by holding annual
commemorations at three monuments erected in the nineteenth century in
honour of the martyred radical leaders John Baird, Andrew Hardie, and
James Wilson at Sighthill Cemetery in Glasgow, Woodside Cemetery in
Paisley, and at Strathaven, Wilson's birthplace, where there is also a
headstone erected as recently as 1990 at his burial site as a result of
our extensive representation to the local council.
In addition, the 19 Scots radicals transported to Botany Bay as a
consequence of their participation in the Battle of Bonnymuir (not
Bonnybridge), and subsequently pardoned in 1835, received their own
belated commemoration in the land of their birth when a plaque, jointly
funded by the society and Glasgow City Council, was unveiled in their
honour -- and in the presence of a representative of the Australian
embassy -- at our annual Sighthill commemoration in September, 1993.
Indeed, this event received appropriate coverage, including a
photograph, in The Herald.

WHILE England's representatives, Sale, will boycott the European
Clubs' Cross Country Championships in Portugal, Shettleston Harriers
Ladies have no embarrassment at all in accepting their invitation to
race in Oporto a week on Sunday. In fact, they have drained the club's
bank account to do so.
The Glasgow club, founded just four years ago as an independent entity
from the men's club of the same name, caters specifically for road and
cross-country, and earned the right to compete in Portugal as the
reigning Scottish team champions.
Sale, English champions for the past 13 years, have an unbroken run
since the European event's inception. But they have withdrawn,
sacrificing their place on the altar of their continuing belief in the
innocence of international 800 metres runner Diane Modahl. It was in
Portugal's Olympic-accredited laboratory in Lisbon that the former
Commonwealth champion's testosterone-loaded urine sample was analysed
last summer.
The champion clubs of more than 20 nations will contest the 6000m
event with teams of six runners.
The Shettleston athletes already have captured this season's national
road and West cross-country relay titles. Victory in the Scottish
cross-country event next month would confirm their place for the 1996
European Clubs' championship.
The cross-country and road running commission of the Scottish Athletic
Federation have contributed #300 and the organisers #200 towards the
cost. But even after having completely wiped out the club's funds of
#700, each member of the six-strong team will still be paying #100 to
represent their country. They are currently trying to find backers, but
will travel at their own expense irrespective.
The team will comprise the three internationalists who made up the
1994 winning team which won the right to compete in Portugal -- Kirsten
Scobie, Elaine Mackay, and Elaine McBrinn -- plus marathon specialists
Julie Harvey and Ann-Marie Hughes, and Shona Robertson, winner of the
Troon 10,000m road event in December.
* JOHN McKenzie, it transpires, set a Scottish native record in the
triple jump when finishing second (15.97m) last weekend in the national
indoor championships. Though based for much of his life in Australia,
Commonwealth internationalist McKenzie was born in Aberdeen. As a Scot,
born in Scotland, he therefore qualifies for a native record.

I was interested to read Dr Johnman's letter about the closure of
Rutherglen Maternity Hospital (January 18).
Our third child was born at this hospital. As a general practitioner
working in the south-east of Glasgow I am aware of the reputation of the
hospital. Living in the north-west of Glasgow, our neighbours expressed
surprise when learning of the intention to attend Rutherglen. The
decision, however, was based on previous experience of more local
maternity services and the standards of care received at Rutherglen by
patients in my practice.
My wife and I have been most impressed by the friendly attitude,
consideration, and levels of competence shown by all the clinical,
nursing, and ancillary staff. These far exceed the standards experienced
elsewhere with the previous two pregnancies.
Rutherglen Maternity is unique. It has the amiable atmosphere of a
small cottage hospital with the clinical resources of any major centre.
I deeply regret that this facility may no longer be available to my
patients, some of whom live within a short walk of the hospital. Perhaps
more importantly, however, it will restrict the choice of hospital for
couples like ourselves living in other parts of Glasgow.

That old favourite, Rule Britannia, came to mind recently and I
thought how very inappropriate some of the words are nowadays. Britannia
rules the waves? What with? A Royal Navy with a few small ships and a
merchant navy the merest shadow of itself? Britons never, never shall be
slaves? You have to be joking! We are slaves to Brussels and the EU.
Since 1066 we have fought off invasions of one sort or another from
Europe, but now we are being taken over by stealth. What could not be
achieved by force of arms is being done with rules and regulations
emanating from across the Channel.
The amount of sovereignty and control of our own country that we have
already lost does not bear thinking about. Ties with Europe should be
loosened before we sink without trace.

For once I applaud John Macleod. His article on the fact that British
workers now work harder for longer hours, on poorer pay, than those of
any comparable country in the Western world is timely (January 24).
Since the defeat of Red Robbo in the car industry industrial relations
have been on the slippery slope and have now reached a dangerous point
of worker enslavement. Unions are incompetent and it is time they were
replaced by some kind of moral protest.
Friends in nursing tell me they are no longer considered a
professional body. Initial contracts are of six months duration followed
by ones of 12 provided they are prepared to sign a waiver accepting that
they are no longer employed by the NHS but must become subservient to
trust conditions.
This means that continuity of service is not recognised and pension
and redundnacy rules do not apply. On the social side such short-term
contracts make it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain loans and
mortgages.
Is it any wonder that stress is commonplace on the work front and that
counselling -- a short number of years ago unknown -- is now the norm?
Where can we look for a champion of decent values to lead us back to a
society that puts people before economics?

I was amazed to find that I was agreeing with the sentiments expressed
in the first part of John Macleod's article (Slave ship Britain feels
the lash, January 24).
Quite overcome I read on.
My amazement didn't last. Once again his easy answer to the country's
economical ills involves us girlies getting back where we belong to the
''hoose and hearth''.
His description of how much better the home life of Tony and Cherie
Blair would be should the formidable Cherie give up her legal career and
tend solely to the upbringing of the Blair weans reads like the script
of a fifties Ovaltine advert.
What cheek to suggest that because a woman has a career her child or
children are denied her full attention or energies.
What, I wonder, does our Hebridean hero suggest we do with widows like
myself? Should I vacate my seat for one of the boys and throw myself and
my wean on the mercy of the State or my family?
Should I then look for husband No 2 as quickly as possible?
Or should I get a job, but make sure that it isn't one a
''breadwinner'' would want?
I've got news for John Macleod. Breadwinners come from both sexes.

The article by Jimmy Reid on Clause 4 begs the question about what
should be substituted for it, and suggests in some way a dilution of the
values held by the Labour Party under the present leader, Tony Blair

In his final comments Jimmy Reid asks, ''Why vote Labour''. Jimmy Reid
should remember the world he came from, and I speak as a former shipyard
worker still working at my trade, not in the yards but with vivid
memories of the years I spent there.
The values placed on the Labour Party by the average Labour voter owe
nothing to Clause 4 or any other clause; they stem from a deep belief
that the Labour Party is the only political party that has ever advanced
significantly the conditions of working men and women in this country
and only the return of a Labour government will once again place the
cause of social justice high on the political agenda.
If terms like social justice are not enough for Jimmy Reid, I can
assure you that for many of us who are working today, for those who have
no work, for those who are homeless, the quest for social justice is
all-embracing and is as cardinal a principle as any Clause 4 or any
other clause in the Labour Party.
I doubt very much whether, in the peripheral housing estates or among
the unemployed skilled and unskilled workers, among the homeless
families in Glasgow, there are debates on the merit of Clause 4 or any
other clause. What there is is a belief among the vast majority of the
people in this country that the Labour Party still is the only political
party which can emancipate us from the misery of a Tory Government.
It is the political party which will make efforts to restore dignity
to individuals by creating a society where their work is respected and
no amount of theological debate over this clause or that clause should
be allowed to detract from the main objective of the Labour Party, which
is to achieve political power, because without political power we can do
nothing.

Self-determination, despite John Major's predictable opposition, is
back on the political agenda. This, of course, is excellent news. But
there is only one problem. All the parties support ''market forces'' and
the class system to varying degrees.
The Labour leadership, in particular, wants to drop Clause 4 of its
party's constitution and commitment to socialist policies. And, while
the Tory media may cheer, the fact is that any Scottish assembly created
by Tony Blair, if he becomes PM, will simply be a talking shop with few
powers.
My view, although an unpopular one with many of my former colleagues,
is that shortly after a general election Scots MPs should have the
courage to meet in Edinburgh and declare the convening of a real
parliament responsible to no-one but the people of Scotland.
As the Chechen example proves, we can accept history or make history.
Leavinng our future to a bunch of right-wing politicians in the South
will create more problems than it solves.

Before the referendum on the Labour Government's proposals for a
Scottish assembly we were frequently told by opponents of the plan that
while the idea of devolution was fine, that particular plan would not
do. One of its serious flaws, we were told, was that the assembly would
have no tax-raising powers.
Today a similar process is under way, although this time we are warned
that a serious flaw is that the Scottish parliament would have
tax-raising powers.
More than 40 years ago I was one of those who collected signatures for
the Scottish Covenant calling for the establishment of a devolved
parliament. Let's not allow real or imagined imperfections to deflect
us, yet again, from that reasonable and desirable aim.

SATURDAY'S child. I knew Robin Cook when he was really a very young
hobbit. He worked, as a hobbit like, for the Workers Educational
Association. This did not make him, in fact, a worker really. It made
him a hobbit, even rather a nice hobbit, but a hobbit all the same. For
a chap who has decided that the workers shouldn't capture anything by
hand or by brain, Robin has but little credentials. It might help if Mr
Cook had captured a job at all by either method, if he wanted
credibility like. In fact Robin has never done a hand's turn which
involved being actually employed by capitalist scum. Or even socialist
scum. Virtually the entire Shadow Cabinet has never actually had jobs. I
am not claiming here to be a socialist, but I am claiming to have had
jobs.
Admittedly it was back in the early sixties when people had jobs
anyway. I think I may have had more than 40 of them. I worked as an
engineer, a barman, a bus conductor, a cleaner, a clerk in a sewage
works, a labourer, a studio artist, a funeral director, a tobacconist, a
. . . eventually I even worked as a teacher. Of art. I worked as a
professional musician and a professional writer and as a professional
broadcaster. The problem is that I have always had a proper job. Had to
work for a living really.
But isn't it grand not to ever have a proper job? You can say what you
like then because you don't know what it is to have to work for a
living. You most especially don't know what it is not to work at all. It
is then you can be horribly philosophical about politics. Like what
Robin I-have-never-had-a-proper-job Cook has been this week. For Robin,
just as anybody in Labour careerism has done, has become dreadfully
philosophical. Casuistry some might call it but not Labour politicians
for whom casuistry is renamed ''pragmatism''.
This was a favourite word of Harold Wilson's. ''I am a pragmatist,''
he boasted. It was a big word then and few knew what it meant when he
produced the word when first he took office. We knew the meaning of it
when he demitted it. It meant the trade unions getting stuffed (this
tightly-knit group of politically-motived men he called the well-stuffed
seamen), the notion that we would all have to tighten our belts, the
move to the International Monetary Fund which required a response to
workers' rights which Mrs Thatcher managed to latch on to and develop
into her notion of no rights at all for a working person. And Thatcher
took on board socialism and nationalised companies and ideas which had
stemmed from the Second World War, when the country overwhelmingly voted
for socialism and voted out Winnie. When the country thought
nationalisation was a dashed good idea.
For the good of the country indeed. We had gone through a war before
to produce a country fit for heroes and saw what happened to heroes. It
seemed right to have all the big, big companies nationalised and
whatever profits which accrued going to the people who had fought those
long years. It may have been simplistic, but then so was the war.
But nobody imagined that Clause 4 was for real. What everybody,
including, it must be pointed out, the Tories, recognised was that
public utilities would need to be taken into public ownership. The last
few years has seen otherwise though, despite the fact that the very idea
of, say, private ownership of the rail network is clearly absurd and
that everywhere else -- Europe and the United States, for instance --
knows that it is fundamental to the infrastructure of the economy itself
that money must be poured in to achieve the needs of transport let alone
industry. In short that we need nationalised industries and plenty of
them. Has it occurred to you that the level of subsidy which the
fishermen now demand, and which the farmers now get, will or has made
both sectors virtually nationalised? When will the Labour Party come out
with arguments for socialism of any kind at all? Not under Blair it
won't. What you are going to be asked to vote for at the next election
is two Tory parties. And yet.
For yet Robin Cook, hobbit or not, is right in his recantation of
Clause 4. For it is salivating and sentimental drivel, a statement
collated by two of the most appalling bourgeois which the Labour Party
ever spewed up, fresh from Hampstead garden suburbs, the dreadful Webbs.
There never was any sense in this poesy which was upheld on the back of
Labour Party cards, even less sense when you consider that Labour was
essentially the party which got capitalism back on its feet and damned
the workers.
Clause 4 is and was nonsense, rather pleasant nonsense, the sort of
rubbish you find in Irish and Scottish songs sung by Robert Wilson or
John McCormick. Clause 4 was Down in the Glen or Galway Bay. A melody
sweetly sprung in June. But hardly realistic. What was and should remain
realistic is the level of control which any government by the people
must have over the economy and of its public services. We have heard
nothing of that from Blair and Labour. Sadly a decent man, Robin Cook,
is saying hee-haw too. He, like, just wants Labout elected. At what
price?
Saturday's child I was. According to the rhyme I work hard for a
living just like everybody else nowadays. Robin Cook was born on a
Thursday. Far to go that verse is. Yes. Very far. Called socialism.

PETE Sampras set up a potential ''dream'' Australian Open final
against world No.2 Andre Agassi in Melbourne after the defending
champion found just enough energy to defeat Michael Chang 6-7, 6-3, 6-4,
6-4 in a semi-final yesterday at Flinders Park.
Just 36 hours after having appeared emotionally drained following a
five-set epic against Jim Courier, Sampras was able to reflect on his
most public grief.
''I think people understand that I'm normal. I have feelings like
everyone else,'' said the No.1 seed, who had been overcome on court by
his concern for ailing coach Tim Gullikson. ''I'm as normal as the next
guy, and I think that's what people have to realise.''
Gullikson, who had two minor strokes late last year, has flown back to
the US, and after hospital tests he is back home with his family.
Neither rain nor a determined Chang could stop Sampras as he fought
back from a set down in a little over three hours on centre court.
Sampras, who will play the winner of today's second semi-final between
Agassi and Aaron Krickstein, admitted he was as physically drained as at
any time in his career and suggested he would have had little left to
offer had the match gone to five sets.
Tomorrow's women's singles final will be between Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario and France's Mary Pierce, the No.4 seed. The Spaniard claimed a
straight-sets semi-final victory over the unseeded American, Marianne
Werdel Witmeyer, who put up some stout resistance in a 47-minute first
set before slumping to a 6-4, 6-1 defeat.
But Sanchez Vicario's hopes of an all-Spanish meeting with Conchita
Martinez were foiled when the No.2 seed was beaten comprehensively 6-3,
6-1 by Pierce.
Sanchez Vicario has gone through her six rounds without dropping a set
-- but every opponent has been unseeded. However, she is confident about
her clash with Pierce -- ''She knows I am tough to beat.''
But Pierce was equally upbeat after her defeat of the reigning
Wimbledon champion, claiming: ''I'm happy with the way I am playing, but
I think I can play better. I'm human . . . you can't play your best
tennis all the time.''
She received on-court treatment for a right shoulder injury at 2-1 in
the first set, but it had little effect on her performance with her
reliable, penetrating serve proving the key to victory.
Pierce, who received a second tournament warning for time-wasting,
said: ''I don't mean to do it, it's just that I need time to prepare
myself.''

<HEADLINE>Shinty clubs warned: apply now or miss the boat</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>HUGH DAN MACLENNAN</BYLINE>

<RECORDNO>980156588</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WARNING has been given to shinty clubs who fail to apply for a place
in the new national league, which starts in just seven months' time.
Duncan Cameron, president of the Camanachd Association, and who has
master-minded the move towards a national structure for the game, said
that the chance presented to clubs this week, with the issuing of
invitations to apply for the new league, was an historic opportunity
which should not be missed.
The new set-up, with a premier division of eight teams chosen equally
from the north and the south top divisions, and a new Division 1 in both
areas, will be conducted on a one-year experimental basis, but Cameron
is convinced the move will become permanent.
''I am aware that there are still a few doubters despite the fact that
the clubs backed this move to the hilt at last year's annual meeting of
the Association,'' said Cameron.
''Kyles Athletic, for example, appear to be making it known that they
will not take part, even if they do qualify in the top four in the south
this season, as seems likely. My understanding is that there are a
number of players in the Kyles camp who want to take part.
''But at the end of the day it is down to all clubs, and not just
Kyles, to assess their situations and aspirations in the next fortnight
and let us know if they are in or out. I think that any clubs not taking
part, who had qualified by right, face being marginalised.''
Cameron cites the experience of hockey, which moved to a similar
structure some years ago, as evidence for his claim that the benefits
which he sees accruing to the game will pass clubs who decide not to
take part in the league.
''What the hockey players found was that the big clubs who did not
want to take part initially eventually came round to the view that they
would be better in than out. But when that situation developed, they
found it wasn't that easy to get in, or to catch up with the other
clubs, who had made strides since the beginning of the league.''
The advent of the national league for shinty has attracted the
interest of potential sponsors, according to Cameron, and local
authorities and other funding agencies have indicated in talks with the
Camanachd Association that national league sides would be treated
favourably when it came to applying for grants to improve facilities and
pitches.
''This is the best way forward and it is an opportunity which our game
just cannot afford to miss,'' added Cameron. ''I would hope that anyone
who does not want to take part will tell us and we can then get on with
the planning without them. Make no mistake, this new league set-up is
going to happen.''
The letters inviting clubs to take part in the new structure next
season were issued this week. The deadline for applications to be
considered is Saturday, February 18, the week before this season's blue
riband event, the Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup.
Cup-holders Kyles go into that first round knowing that if they lose
against Glenurquhart, their prospects of success next season could be
considerably diminished, given the lack of competition they could face
outside the national league pilot.

YET another twist on the commercial uses that Robert Burns is put to.
Yesterday the Belfast property company Ewart held an Irish Burns
luncheon in Glasgow, complete with Guinness, Irish whiskey, and haggis
in order to tell agents, retailers, and surveyors about its latest
shopping centre in Belfast. Considering that Dumfriesshire farm that
Burns was ruinously fobbed off with, property companies were probably
not too high on his list of favourite people, but no matter.
That delightful reader of Burns poetry, Shona Cameron, was there to
toast Burns, but alas the assorted Glasgow property people were too busy
shovelling Guinness and haggis down their throats while holding umpteen
conversations to actually listen to her. But she probably got her own
back. She decided to read them the Burns poem To a Louse.
Growing pains
THAT fine former Rangers player Roger Hynd was willing to debate
sectarianism at Glasgow University the other day with the likes of
Bishop Joe Devine and MP George Galloway. The bold Roger was doing fine
until he began describing the unique atmosphere of an Old Firm game.
''When you walk out at an Old Firm game,'' he declared, ''you hear the
sound of 40,000 people cheering, and you grow six inches.'' Which
brought the shouted comment from a young lady in the audience: ''That
must be why they wear long shorts these days.''
Where's Eric?
SUN journalist Andy Collier was telling the listeners on Radio
Scotland yesterday morning, during his review of the papers, what a
marvellous picture his newspaper was carrying of Man U's Eric Cantona
showing a fan the close-up detail of his football boot studs. Alas the
picture only made the very latest editions of the paper, so that most
puzzled Sun readers could not find it, and were left saying: ''It's not
so much Ooh Ah Cantona as Ou est Cantona.''
Well of course, they didn't actually say that, but it's such a good
line it would be a shame not to use it.
The Name Game
CAN there be a more aptly named woman than the Daily Record reader
from Coatbridge who had her letter published this week complaining about
how people these days just don't know how good they've got it? It was
written by Mrs A Biddy. We can assume that is her correct name as I'm
sure the Record checks these days ever since it was embarrassed to learn
it had published a letter under the name of Hugh Jarse.
* ANOTHER suitable name is that of the gentleman from Mayfair, London,
advertising in the latest issue of the Scots Magazine for old whisky
crates, preferably with the names of the whisky companies on them. Not
the easiest of collector's items to display on the mantelpiece, we would
have thought. Anyhow, our crate man is called Ben Lomond.
Wrong river
THERE is a particular job that radio journalists do not enjoy, which
is known as vox pops, when they have to stand in the street and stop
passers-by for their pertinent views on some subject or another. The
fact that most people are more concerned with doing their shopping or
day-dreaming about finding a job means that it can be a long and tedious
exercise before enough suitable comments are recorded.
Thus the Dundee reporter for Radio Scotland, Alan Grant, was not
overly excited yesterday when sent out on the streets by the producer of
Good Morning Scotland to ask for people's views on the Royal Family.
After more than an hour of buttonholing people he returned to the studio
with enough comments. It was only after the tape was sent that the young
producer, who hails from south of the Border, which of course has got
nothing to do with it, discovered that Dundee was on Tayside, and not
Royal Deeside, as he had assumed.
No flies on Pete
THE American magazine Men's Health, which is a huge seller in the
States, detailing how to improve your health, love life, and chat-up
lines, has launched a British edition, as colleague Stephen McGinty
wrote about last week.
Followers of the American edition tell me they hope the British
version will repeat such essential information as the article on how men
over 30 can get rid of that embarrassing last drop while standing at a
urinal, and how to get lipstick off your collar -- spray with hairspray,
leave for a couple of minutes, then wipe with a clean cloth apparently.
Perhaps not so essential was the article by tennis ace Pete Sampras,
the man with one of the fastest serves in the game, explaining the best
way to swat a fly. Complete with diagrams of fly trajectories, Pete
explains: ''You can't hesitate for even a moment with flies. If you do,
they're gone. So when you go for the swat, swing right through the fly.
Go for oblivion, and worry about the clean-up later.'' My goodness, it's
tough being a man these days.
Off-putting
FOLLOWING on from all these books that are written about how people
can improve themselves comes a company called Career Track which sells
more than 70 audio and video cassettes with titles such as How to
Interview and Hire the Right People, and How to Be an Outstanding
Receptionist.
One that stands out is Overcoming Procrastination. The two cassettes,
costing #30, last for more than 2[1/2] hours, which should appeal to the
most ardent procrastinators -- if they ever get round to buying them of
course.

Ross Finlay test drives the latest Polo
PARTLY because of the exaggerated whoopee-style reaction to it in some
quarters of the motoring press, it has taken me a while to get over a
certain initial grumpiness about the new Volkswagen Polo. An exercise in
France with left-hand drive examples, and another in England with some
early UK-market cars, made me feel that it was very well built,
generally a notable advance over the previous Polo, but not necessarily
the ultimate best-possible-ever supermini.
The one-litre models are painfully slow. In addition, claiming that
the new car, within its shorter overall length, has similar legroom to
the one it replaces, is not saying much. And the French and English test
areas gave few opportunities to see how the Polo handled on any kind of
sporting road.
Third time lucky. Driving a 1.6-litre five-door on familiar local
roads made the whole project seem much more appealing. This is the
quickest of the Polos, fitted with a 75bhp engine and available in four
trim levels from L at #9149 to GLX at #11,750. The higher priced cars
come with items like anti-lock braking as standard, but it is worth
noting that power assisted steering is specified right across the range.
Like an increasing number of small cars these days, the Polo is built
with sensible high-standing bodywork. If driver and passengers can sit
quite upright, then, with the generous headroom the Polo offers, they
will need less room to sprawl their legs and feet around.
Rear passenger kneeroom in the back of the Polo, however, seemed only
just adequate the first time I tried the car. When a group of us went
three-up during the second test session, the bloke in the back spread
over both rear seats trying to get comfortable. Now, looking over the
car more carefully, and trying various seat positions, I have to say
that in the rear the Polo may be a neat fit, but it is not actually
cramped. Boot space is fine for a car of this size.
The exterior finish, the close fit of the body panels, and the solid
clunk as the doors close are all impressive. Volkswagen now provides
much brighter paintwork choices than it used to, but the same still
cannot be said about the interior. The new Polo fascia is bulky in
appearance -- granted, there has to be space for the optional
passenger-side airbag -- and very dark in colour. To me it seems
unnecessarily forbidding.
One important aspect of the Polo's appeal is that the controls, major
and minor, work precisely. That contributes towards the impression it
gives, of being a ''proper'' car on a small scale, a soon-to-be-fixed
water leak and crackly radio reception on the test car notwithstanding.
You feel that it will keep on going, month after month, as a reliable
and sensible investment.
Out on the road, the latest Polo is a revelation. It is light to
drive, lively and agile, and a lot of fun if you enjoy pressing on. The
handling is unexpectedly sporting. I had the feeling, on some winding A
and B-class roads with white lining down the centre, that I had plenty
of road width to play with, and not just because of the small size of
the car.
The height adjustment for the steering column was appreciated, and I
really liked the driving position. However, I prefer to have the seat
well reclined. With the Polo's high waistline and the sharp slope of the
front-end bodywork, I could not see anything at all of the bonnet.
The 1.6 accelerates to 60mph in about 12.5 seconds and goes on to a
test track maximum around 107mph. It manages 53mpg at 56mph, 39 at 75
and 32mpg around town. Safety and security features available are well
planned, and the smallest Volkswagen is a pleasure to drive. It gives
the impression of being a car for the long haul, in terms of both
individual journeys and an extensive annual mileage.

WE are within a few months of the fiftieth anniversary of the end of
the Second World War and significant anniversaries are beginning to
appear in quick succession. Auschwitz, the extermination and labour camp
in Poland, was entered by Russian infantry 50 years ago today. Dresden,
the splendid baroque city and former capital of Saxony, was devastated
by bombing 50 years ago next month. Sensitivities about such events
remain acute but they should not be ignored. Of the Holocaust, of which
Auschwitz has become the best-known symbol, little new can be said, but
that should not deter us from its reconsideration and assessment,
especially since some still would deny its existence altogether -- or,
almost as bad, try to soften its almost unspeakable cruelties and divert
attention from those individuals, starting with Hitler, with the direct
responsibility for it.
Dresden is in a quite different category, even if few would want now
to defend urban terror bombing. Senior RAF officers are probably right
not to attend next month's anniversary ceremonies in the city. Memories
of the city's fate are still too tender. The RAF has, however, been
unfairly pilloried for what occurred there. The far more massive
American contribution to the bombing is, curiously, ignored, at least in
popular minds, which are also prone to accept uncritically the early
tally of the victims, which was exaggerated. Dresden's destruction was
certainly a tragedy but it was not an act of indiscriminate terror. In
fact the city was an important centre of ammunition manufacture as well
as a key railway junction serving the German armies fighting the Red
Army to its east. Indeed, it was a Red Army request for its attack, to
help their own final land offensive, which led the two Allied air forces
to hit it.
Few contemporaries, surviving now, will need reminding of how fiercely
the Germans fought 50 years ago in the last year of the war. It is only
hindsight which allows us to see how inevitable their defeat was.
Possibly Dresden could have been saved, but many more soldiers might
have lost their lives had German resistance been more effective or
prolonged. Such fine judgment probably entered few calculations: war is
always a brutal encounter but seldom ever as brutal as that which
Auschwitz witnessed, and which the whole Eastern Front experienced on
both sides.
The Second World War was, with its predecessor, a European catastrophe
but our general, and justified, horror at their cost in life and
reduction of hitherto accepted standards of behaviour must not impose a
sentimental plea that we were all guilty. In each case Germany's leaders
led their people into war, and their dutiful people paid a dreadful
price for the way in which civic virtues made them accept the authority
of the State. Part of that price was colossal physical destruction, but
of course it could have been far worse. Germany has survived, and its
people have prospered for 50 years, not least because they too were
liberated from Nazi tyranny by their enemies, who have since become
their friends. We need not feel guilty about that achievement, though
none will glory in everything it demanded.

THE convener of the NFU's livestock committee, Stewart Whiteford,
announced yesterday that he is to stand for election to one of the two
vice-presidential posts in the union at its annual general meeting in
Aberdeen in March.
Mr Whiteford farms 2200 acres with his two brothers in Easter Ross,
and lives at Easter Rarichie near Nigg. He runs breeding sheep, cattle,
and an arable enterprise, and he feels that it is essential that
livestock interests are well represented in the union's affairs.
He commented: ''I want to offer the membership a choice, and I believe
that the well-being of the livestock sector is absolutely essential to
Scottish agriculture.
''I am also genuinely interested in the affairs of the union, and want
to be involved in the development of its business plan.''
Mr Whiteford, who has travelled extensively on union business both
around Scotland and to London and Brussels, has his own opinions on how
the organisation should develop.
''I would like to accommodate some of Maitland Mackie's ideas, but
it's quite clear that the membership do not want a demolition of the
democratic process. I also want the union to be more pro-active, but I
appreciate that there are a lot of wobblies such as BSE and the welfare
issue, where it's very difficult to take that line.''
He also feels that Scottish farmers should give their union greater
support. ''We run a tight ship, with limited financial resources, and
therefore we have to work with the other UK unions both in London and in
Europe. We cannot go it alone.''
The two present vice-presidents, Sandy Mole and Jim Wyllie, both
intend to offer themselves for re-election, and there may well be one
other candidate.

<HEADLINE>Scottish Milk is highest payer among the co-ops</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>

PRIVATE dairy companies buying directly from producers appear to have
justified their prediction that they would pay above the prices offered
by the milk co-operatives, the Scottish Dairy Trade Federation indicated
yesterday.
In a review of November prices, Scottish Milk comes out as having paid
the highest price among the co-operatives -- 24.05p per litre for
standard quality. In the same month, Wiseman Dairies were reported to
have been paying 26.1p, comfortably ahead of their commitment to pay at
least 1p a litre more than Scottish Milk.
The federation, in the latest edition of their magazine Milk Focus,
say they expect such a differential to continue, as it is normal, in
varying degrees, in other parts of the world.
The prices paid for standard quality milk in November by the four
co-operatives which have succeeded the milk marketing boards in Britain,
were: Scottish Milk, 24.05p per litre; Aberdeen Milk Co., 23.13p; North
of Scotland, 24p; Milk Marque 23.75p. The Northern Ireland Milk
Marketing Board, which will not be wound up until March, paid an average
price of 22.13p.
The average price received by producers supplying the three main
co-operatives in Scotland in November (for average quality) was almost
exactly 24p per litre -- 0.25p above the Milk Marque average for the
same quality.
This comparison is extremely sensitive to quality variations, because
Milk Marque pays over twice as much for extra fat as the three Scottish
co-ops, and almost four times as much for extra protein.
A farmer with milk averaging 0.1% above the Scottish average on both
counts, would have been about 0.2p per litre better off selling to Milk
Marque in November. The converse would apply to farmers with below
average quality.
The federation forecasts that if November prices held for a full year,
the net returns to producers supplying the co-operatives in Scotland
would be in the region of 6% higher than in the last year of the milk
marketing boards. Current weaker market trends suggest, however, that
this increase is unlikely to hold.
A review of recent milk auction results reports that the amount of
milk not disposed of at auction has been in excess of capacity available
at Dairy Crest, who currently operate by contract as buyer of last
resort. This has resulted in milk being offered by private treaty to
selected buyers at relatively low prices, with trade reported as low as
20p per litre.
The federation notes that relatively large volumes of milk have been
sold to buyers in England, with tankers on hire to Scottish Milk seen as
far south as Gloucester. ''The net return from such sales, after taking
account of the high cost of haulage, must be unusually low,'' says
Focus.

SOMETIMES the only credible response to events in these islands is to
let one's jaw drop. It is also highly satisfying, but once the initial
burst of pleasure is over it is necessary to try to make sense of the
relevant event; that way lies mental health, at the very least. Eric
Cantona, the latest edition of Social Trends, and the Celtic share issue
are unlikely partners, and that includes the first and third items.
Nevertheless, each of them reflects some aspects of the way we see
ourselves and the way we deal with the issues which dominate our lives.
On the face of it, the sight of many thousands of football fans baying
abuse at a Manchester United footballer is quite as astonishing as the
actions of the footballer in response. It has been pointed out that
young children would have been affected by Cantona's retaliation on fans
who were allegedly abusing him in language sometimes euphemised as
colourful. The same children were quite as sullied by being within
earshot of the verbal abuse.
Cantona's actions were despicable. Provocation is not an excuse but it
is part of playing football. If he cannot cope he should not be playing.
The ritualised, obscene abuse of players by fans is also a problem. Why
should adult, presumably responsible people behave in a way they would
eschew in almost any other situation? If you are a fan the answer may be
self-evident; for the rest of us it must remain shrouded in incoherence.
Perhaps the nearest you can get is to say that whatever happens at
football matches must matter a great deal to those who are supporters,
and here we are into the realm of Celtic Football Club and the attempts
to trace the dynamics of our everyday lives. According to the latest
edition of Social Trends, Britain is a richer place in 1995 but hardly a
happier one. Disposable income has increased by more than a third over
the past 30 years and the lives we lead today are clearly richer in a
material sense than those of our fathers. This is reflected in the
astonishing response to the Celtic Football Club share issue. Some
10,000 people have each disbursed a minimum of more than #600 each in
order to own a part of the club they support. If this illustrates the
availability of disposable income, it also shines a clear light on a
related subject.
Again we have a question. Why should ordinary people, many of whom are
obviously not rich, pay a solid sum of money for an investment in their
football club when they could put it in a building society and earn
around the same or better return in interest? On this one even the
non-fan is on safe ground. It is about having a part of something that
is precious to you, of belonging and being involved. Social Trends tells
us that the modern citizen is insecure and anxious. How much better it
would be if fulfilment could be found in and through wider society. This
is not to decry football but it does not make us as a nation more secure
or less anxious and apathetic. As we become richer, it seems, our values
become ever more skewed.

SHEEP farmers who wish to participate in the second lease and transfer
period for allocation of 1993 quota from the national reserve, require
to submit completed notification forms by Friday of next week.
This second period is being opened because of the excessive delay in
dealing with the 1993 national reserve, recall consultants Hayes
McCubbin Macfarlane, in their latest sheep quota newsletter. The final
results were only announced in November last year.
Eligible producers will be able to acquire quota to set against sheep
claimed in the Sheep Annual Premium Scheme for 1993, for which they did
not hold quota at the time.
Any producer who had more quota for 1993 SAPS than the number of sheep
claimed, can now lease this surplus quota to any producer who is
eligible to acquire quota for 1993. This does not apply, however, to
producers who received quota from the national reserve -- they may not
sell or lease out any quota until after three years usage.
To acquire quota, a producer requires to meet any one of the following
criteria: Initial allocation of quota was received after July 23, 1993;
application to the national reserve for 1993 was refused, or scaled
back; and an allocation was received of pool quota, which is treated as
an initial allocation after August 31, and bestows eligibility for both
1993 and 1994 second periods.
Any member of a partnership or group who has insufficient quota for
their allocation of sheep in the 1993 SAPS, can lease quota from other
members of the partnership or group who has surplus quota.
There will be a similar second period, because of the delay in dealing
with the 1994 national reserve, which is still not announced. Rules of
eligibility are expected to be similar, which means that most producers
who are eligible for 1993 will not be eligible for 1994. The
consultants' advice in such situations is to try to arrange a two-year
lease of quota when they lease in for 1993.
The premium paid for 1993 SAP was #24.41 per sheep for Less Favoured
Areas, and #19.25 for non-LFA producers. The going rate for lease of
1993 quota in the second period has been about #9 to #11 per unit. ''The
premium will be paid immediately after the processing of notifications,
making it a very attractive investment for those eligible producers who
are short of quota for 1993,'' said Mr Spencer Hayes, a partner in the
consultancy firm.

January 23.
As the chief medical adviser to the National Asthma Campaign, I was
surprised to read Dr Cunningham's letter stating that smoking and/or
pollution were not to be blamed for the increase in the prevalence of
asthma, especially among children (January 13).
Although Dr Cunningham was making a valid point that more resources
were needed for research and support for people with asthma, her letter
was misleading.
More research is needed into the causes of and treatments for asthma
but several studies have shown that maternal smoking during pregnancy
increases the risk of a child developing asthma and other wheezy
illnesses.
We do not know if air pollution causes asthma, but it clearly makes it
worse for people with the condition. With 155 children admitted to
hospital every day because of asthma, the need to raise awareness of
these two major triggers is vital. While we must certainly keep an open
mind about causation of illness and not make premature conclusions, we
should not dismiss knowledge about factors that have been proven to
cause or worsen asthma.

THE Lanark-based auctioneering firm of Lawrie and Symington Ltd
appears, for the moment at least, to be held securely by its largely
farmer shareholding, following a judgement in the Court of Session in
Edinburgh.
In one of the most complicated disputes involving an agricultural
issue, lasting no less than three weeks in Court during December, Lord
Penrose has found against the Caledonian Trust, who mounted what turned
out to be a very acrimonious bid for L and S in late June.
The basis of the Court action was a claim by Caledonian that they had
an oral agreement to purchase the 34.9% stake of L and S's largest
shareholder, the Elliot of Harwood Trust. Lord Penrose found that this
alleged agreement was not binding.
Thus far, L and S have made no official comment, but chairman John
Chapman, a Motherwell butcher, has frequently declared that he and his
board can bring the company back to real profit.
The possible sale of Peebles or Edinburgh marts has been mooted in the
past, but Mr Chapman has consistently discounted this course of action,
saying that if Peebles were sold, a new facility would be put in place.
The appointment of a chief executive along the lines taken by United
Auctions and the ANM Group, is one move favoured by many shareholders.
Caledonian Trust's chief executive, Mr Douglas Lowe, said: ''I am
naturally disappointed at the outcome, especially since our case
appeared to get stronger throughout the hearing. However, we have
succeeded in raising the value of shares in L and S from 19p to #1.
''If we had purchased the firm, it would have been in the best
interests of farmers, customers, and shareholders. However, I wish the
mart all success.''

WHEN defectors ask for asylum they are initially interviewed to see if
they are who they say they are. They will then be whisked away to a safe
house, usually well-guarded, comfortable accommodation in the country
where they undergo a debriefing process usually lasting many weeks. In
this latest   case,  involving Colonel Firzet Djabozov, he will be
questioned initially by MI6, then by MI5 and then by Military
Intelligence. It may be that a joint interrogation team will be set up.
The teams will be immediately interested in what made him defect and
then his ''shopping list''; they will need to know his targets in order
to learn what his bosses are interested in acquiring, not only to be
able to protect the targets, but to see which way Russia's own military
technology is developing.
They will also need to know who his contacts are here. Are there any
moles operating in the British security services? Does he know the names
of any businessmen,  scientists or soldiers selling secrets. His
interrogators will seek to extract all his ''family jewels''. Very often
a defector will try to keep some of those jewels to himself for use in
future bargaining.
The skilled debriefers are well aware of the defector's hesitations --
may even have some lingering loyalty to his old outfit which inhibits
him. So their questioning can be tough, using the hard man, soft man
techniques. The defectors are never physically harmed but they can be
put under psychological pressure.
They can be switched around, taken from the comfortable country house,
to a safe flat in London. His chief interrogator may be replaced. Much
depends on whether he has come over for ideological reasons and is
prepared to sing like a canary, or has ideas of making a lot of money by
selling his secrets. He certainly won't make much out of the British
taxpayer. Even Gordievsky gets only a modest pension and relies on his
writing to supplement his regular benefits.
In between questioning sessions, he will join his interrogators for
meals prepared by an excellent chef in an officers' mess type
atmosphere. He will then probably be handed over to the Americans who
will have their own questions to ask him. And, even when the questioning
is done, he can be recalled at any time if a situation develops on which
it is thought he can shed light.
Then there comes the problem of what to do with him. He can be
resettled under an assumed name, even have his face altered by plastic
surgery. He will be assisted to find a home -- a nice flat or suburban
house -- nothing flashy and he will be given help in setting up a
business.
Many defectors are trained in professions apart from espionage. He
could be a scientist, a writer, an accountant. His minders will help
ease him into British life. In the bad old days a defector was
automatically put on the KGB's death list and trained assassins hunted
for him. Many were killed. Some, like Oleg Bitov, were approached and
persuaded to return to Moscow for an anti-Western publicity jamboree.
A law has now been passed by Russia's parliament outlawing the
assassination of defectors, but any defector returning to Russia would
not have an easy time. Even Gordievski is the subject of propaganda
attacks by former colleagues who still regard him as a traitor. These
have taken the form of letters to Western newspapers -- to which he has
replied in typical robust style.
The defector will never be completely physically free. He will always
be looking over his shoulder. The British security service learned its
lesson from Bitov. He was allowed too much freedom, the KGB tracked him
down and, without minders, he was persuaded to go back to Moscow.
The defector also has psychological problems. His treachery often
returns to haunt him. Philby, Burgess and Maclean all suffered the
torments of the traitor and tried to drown their suffering in booze.
Many have marital problems -- like Gordievski whose marriage broke up
after he successfully campaigned to have his wife Leila and his
daughters join him in England.
Defectors also suffer from the feeling that they are not properly
appreciated, that they have not been sufficiently well rewarded for the
risks they have taken. And they become gloomy and bad-tempered,
sometimes suicidal. His contacts have to watch out for these signs and
offer ''counselling''.
It is interesting that Djabozov should have come from Geneva for it is
the home of a great number of UN scientific bodies where scientific and
technical knowledge is exchanged. Russia is a member of most of these
bodies. It is therefore a happy hunting ground for the GRU whose agents
can tap in quite legitimately to some of the West's most advanced
scientific developments. Not only do they acquire the scientific and
technical knowledge, they can also learn where these developments are
taking place, which company is doing the work and which scientists are
involved. They can then plan to acquire yet more secrets illegally.

JOHN McClelland, the senior executive whose departure from IBM last
week caused widespread surprise across Silicon Glen, has been confirmed
in a major new role at rival PC maker, Digital Equipment.
From the start of next month McClelland becomes vice-president,
worldwide manufacturing and logistics, for Digital's growing PC
business. Since last August, McClelland had held an almost identical
role with IBM's PC company, the culmination of a 26-year career with Big
Blue.
Given the shares the two companies currently enjoy in the global PC
marketplace, IBM appears the much bigger job. But McClelland, like his
new boss Bernhard Auer, argues that Digital is one of the
fastest-growing PC companies in the business. ''The PC area is one of
Digital's biggest opportunities,'' said McClelland last night.
In contrast, IBM, having been world number one in PCs, is now
struggling to hold on to market share. Only this week chairman Lou
Gerstner acknowledged underperformance in IBM's PC company and promised
action to turn things round.
In his new role at Digital the 49-year-old McClelland will be
responsible for main assembly plants in Canada and Taiwan, as well as
Digital's new PC facility in Irvine, a spin-out from its Ayr plant. He
also takes charge of smaller facilities in Hong Kong and Australia and
global logistics and distribution.
He was approached by Digital towards the end of last year. Last night
he said ''It was a very difficult decision to take. IBM was a company I
enjoyed working for. But I also felt I wanted to do something new. If
you are one of the two or three really major players, it is harder to
grow your PC business dramatically.
''My view is that Digital has approached the PC market in the right
way and that's why it's current growth is phenomenal.''
McClelland, who holds a number of public posts in Scotland, including
membership of the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, will have a
base at Irvine, although he will spent significant amounts of time at
Digital's HQ in Maynard, Massachusets. He is likely to be on planes
almost as often as he was with IBM.

The defection to Britain of a senior Russian spy focuses attention on
the new shape of what was one of the world's most active espionage
organisations. Christopher Dobson reports on the FIS, successor to the
notorious KGB's foreign section, and describes the fate of defectors
DESPITE the downfall of communism, Russian spying in the West has
never stopped. Members of the FIS, the Foreign Intelligence Service,
which has taken over from the old foreign section of the KGB, the First
Chief Directorate, speak openly of their need to spy but in a
''civilised fashion''. The problem for the Russians is that after the
old KGB was wound up in 1991, its successor lost many of its best people
-- many of whom are selling their stories to the West and running
security services in Moscow to protect Western businessmen from Russian
criminals.
The other problem for the FIS is that it and the Federal
Counter-Intelligence Service (FSK), the equivalent of MI5, serve not
only Russia but all members of the CIS, the Commonwealth of Independent
States. So the new security services are having a difficult time in
carrying out their tasks. They are also hampered by the fact that they
have lost the assistance of the intelligence services of the former
Eastern bloc countries -- especially the East Germans.
The GRU, Glavnoye Razbedyvatelnoye Upravleniye, or Chief Intelligence
Directorate of the Soviet General Staff, has none of these problems. It
has continued its work unaffected by the demise of communism. It is
responsible only to the Russian General Staff. It has recruited a number
of the old KGB's top men. And is continuing doing what it has always
done, gather military and especially scientific and technical knowledge
from the West.
Based on the military intelligence service of the Tsarist army, it
works from 19 Znamensky Street, Moscow, a baroque palace which once
belonged to a rich Tsarist merchant. It does not carry out ''political''
espionage like the old KGB with its ''agents of influence'' and
''disinformation''.
It had some great successes during the Cold War. Among its most
successful ''illegals'' were the British-born master spy Rudolf Abel,
Gordon Lonsdale, who ran the Portland spy ring, Klaus Fuchs, the atom
spy. It also had a great disaster, the defection ''in place'' of Colonel
Oleg Penkovsky, one of the best moles the West ever had.
Another, more recent, defection from the GRU was that of Viktor
Oshchenko in 1992. Oshchenko, listed as a counsellor at Russia's Paris
embassy, was granted asylum in Britain. His defection led to the trial
and imprisonment of electronics engineer, Michael Smith, in September
1993, Oshchenko had recruited Smith in the early 70s.
The GRU is divided into four divisions -- operations, information,
training, and auxiliary. It does not have the evil reputation of the KGB
and ''Smersh'', but it does train its own assassins although these are
rarely used today. The Spetsnaz, the Russian SAS, comes partially under
its control. In 1992 the newly appointed head of the GRU, Colonel
General Yevgeni Mimokhin, said: ''Some officials have called for the
winding up of our military intelligence activities abroad. Such
ultimatums are pointless.'' He also confirmed that the Spetsnaz ''have a
wide range of intelligence tasks''.
Its officers' major function is to steal, buy or bribe their way into
the hi-tech secrets of the West. They are given shopping lists compiled
every year by the Military Industrial Commission, the VPK, of secrets
they want bought or stolen. By their own estimate, more than 5000
Russian military research projects benefit each year from
Western-acquired technology.
The GRU is estimated to save tens of thousands of man-years in
scientific research and hundreds of millions of pounds in research
costs. Projects which are seen to stem directly from GRU espionage are
the Russian copy of the American Awacs, the airborne early-warning
system. The Jack bomber, a copy of the US BI, state-of-the-art
computers, micro-electronics, lasers, and air-to-air missiles. GCHQ is
one of its prime targets.
The GRU has been known to steal a missile and drive it across the
border sticking out the back of a car, but those crude methods no longer
work. They do not need to. They find many Western companies only too
eager to help in the name of business. Electronic equipment, especially
computers, has been funnelled to Russia by way of Japan and Sweden. The
work is unrelenting and it could not be stopped without causing severe
damage to the Russian economy.

Wellcome yesterday rebuffed the #9000m from Glaxo and said that it was
actively exploring
other opportunities. However, the chances of any white knight charging
to Wellcome's
defence appear slim. Not least because of the generosity of Glaxo's
offer.
GLAXO hit the acquisition trail again yesterday just days after
launching a #9000m hostile bid for rival drugs firm Wellcome.
This time it is proposing to pay $533m (#335m) for the loss-making US
drugs discovery company Affymax. The company is a leader in the drug
discovery field and specialises in finding complex chemicals to treat
disease.
Meanwhile, Wellcome's board rejected the Glaxo bid, tabled on Monday,
describing it as ''inadequate'', even though it represents a 49% premium
to last Friday's closing share price.
John Robb, chairman and chief executive of Wellcome, said that one of
the disappointing features of the bid was that it focused so heavily on
job losses.
City analysts believe that 10,000 to 15,000 out of the two companies'
joint workforce of 65,000 could lose their jobs if the takeover
succeeds, with the axe falling heavily on research and development
laboratories in South-east England.
Wellcome's board intend to ask the Wellcome Trust not to accept the
offer. Glaxo expects to hear confirmation today of its agreement with
the Wellcome Trust for the sale of its nearly 40% stake in Wellcome.
Sir Richard Sykes, deputy chairman and chief executive of Glaxo, said
he was ''disappointed'' by Wellcome's reaction. He believes that the
proposed merger is not only in the best interests of both Wellcome and
Glaxo shareholders, but that it will secure Britain's leading position
in the pharmaceutical industry.
''The commercial logic of our bid is clear,'' said Sir Richard. Offer
documents are to be dispatched as soon as practicable.
Wellcome said that it was actively exploring other opportunities.
However, the chances of any ''white knight'' charging to Wellcome's
defence appear slim. Not least because of the generosity of Glaxo's
offer which values Wellcome at around 22 times earnings per share
including exceptional items.
Any potential rival would have to offer in excess of the #6300m cash
which Glaxo is offering to win the support of the Wellcome Trust
charity.
Although Wellcome is expected to eventually agree to the merger, Glaxo
may have to offer more money, which should not be a problem.
Traditionally Glaxo has relied on organic growth but the retirement of
former chairman Sir Paul Girolami and arrival in the chief executive's
seat of Sir Richard has prompted a rethink of this growth strategy.
Even the mighty Glaxo, Europe's biggest pharmaceutical company even
before taking into account a successful Wellcome takeover, cannot remain
immune from the restructuring which is taking place within the industry.
The main impetus for rationalisation within the industry has come from
Government healthcare reforms which are putting serious downward
pressure on drug company profit margins. Companies able to provide
innovative drugs for diseases that are currently poorly served, such as
cancer, AIDs and mental illnesses such as Schizophrenia, are better able
to command premium prices.
Often small biotechnology companies, with their lower cost base and
research focus, are able to discover potentially useful new compounds
quicker than larger companies. This is why companies such as Glaxo are
establishing alliances with smaller firms.
''There's no question that the industry in which we operate is
changing dramatically. We have to adjust and adapt to that change and
make sure we are leading and not being driven along by it,'' said Sir
Richard.
The Affymax acquisition together with the proposed Wellcome takeover

ROYAL Bank of Scotland is to spend #11.2m on around 550 new Cashline
machines -- thought to be the biggest such investment by any Scottish
bank, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The order is the largest that AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions (UK),
part of the US telecommunications giant, has ever received for delivery
and installation in a 12-month period.
Royal Bank's market research shows that more than 70% of its customers
regard Cashline as either very important or the single most important
service.
The majority of the new machines will replace existing ones, primarily
branch-based terminals. Some will also be installed in new sites, such
as supermarkets, garage forecourts and shopping centres.
Head of Cashline network development Nigel Spencer said: ''It is one
of the most ambitious programmes of its kind.''
Royal Bank has one of the busiest cash dispenser networks in Europe,
with 881 machines from Shetland to Cornwall, 470 of them in Scotland.
The new machines have been manufactured at AT&amp;T's Dundee factory,
whose success resulted in the opening of a #9m operation at Dalgety Bay
in Fife, in November. AT&amp;T supplies terminals to every Scottish bank.
Philip Mantle, managing director of AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions,
said: ''This significant order from Royal Bank of Scotland confirms
AT&amp;T's leadership in the self-service market.''

AN upbeat statement from Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugars specialist, yesterday
illustrated how the City is always looking for more.
Though the company reported a 10% increase in sales for its first
quarter, shares fell 6p before settling 4p down on 423p largely because
the board could do nothing more than confirm what the market was already
expecting.
''The results to date suggest that the group's performance for the
full year is likely to be broadly in line with market expectations,'' it
said.
Pre-tax profits last year rose 23% to #274m on turnover that increased
10.6% to #4220m. Much of the boost stemmed from the US where the Staley
subsidiary is still improving profitability.
Lower net raw material costs and a decreased operating cost base
enabled further progress to be achieved in North America. Europe and the
rest of the world also enjoyed higher demand in the sweeteners and
starches division while the company animal feed and bulk storage
performed satisfactorily.

WARRANTS &amp; Value Investment Trust (WAVIT) has seen its net asset value
fall by 13.7% to 34.47p per share last year in line with the generally
depressed market trend.
Though the benchmark FT Investment Trust index fell only 10.9% over
the same period, the sharper decline in WAVIT was to be expected because
of the accelerant effect of warrants.
Equally, in rising markets a trust like WAVIT can more easily beat the
main indices and since formation in March 1993, the nav has increased by
42% despite last year's setback.

ALLIED Domecq said yesterday that it had sold its Dutch breweries,
famed for their Oranjeboom beers, to Belgium's leading brewer Interbrew.
Talks between the two groups had been going on for some time and
industry sources suggested that the price paid was around #90m by the
privately-owned brewer best known for its Stella Artois beer.
The deal will push Interbrew to No 2 brewer in the Netherlands behind
Heineken, third in France and eighth in Italy, while its Stella Artois
beer is brewed under licence in Britain by Whitbread.
''The regrouping of our operations with those of Oranjeboom
Bierbrouwerij will significantly reinforce our position in this
important market (the Netherlands),'' said Hans Meerloo, chief executive
of Interbrew, in a statement.
Allied has said it plans to concentrate on its worldwide spirits and
retailing interests, and it is in the process of selling its food
interests which are expected to fetch around #1000m.
The sell-off has included Allied's Lyons coffee business, its food
ingredients and the formation in 1992 of the British brewing joint
venture Carlsberg-Tetley with the Danish brewer. The two major food
businesses still up for sale are its Tetley tea business and Lyons cakes
bakery division.
Allied said there would be a loss on disposal which will be offset
against profits from other disposals.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS companies are falling over themselves to get a
slice of the German market, with Cable &amp; Wireless yesterday confirming
that it was following British Telecom in linking with a German company.
The group, best known for the Mercury network here, is forming two
joint ventures with Veba, a holding company which includes Germany's
second-largest energy utility. The relationship will be cemented by Veba
buying a stake of up to 10.5% in C&amp;W.
Its offer to buy 5% for up to 435p per C&amp;W share was soon
over-subscribed at a strike price of 395p. On this, the C&amp;W price came
back sharply from a high of 402p to finish unchanged on balance at 378p.
There are no immediate plans to go to the full 10.5%.
Veba already has a number of telecom interests, notably a 28% holding
in E-Plus, the third-largest digital mobile phone network in Germany,
and has designs on getting a much larger share of the lucrative German
market when it is liberalised.
C&amp;W will have 45% of a joint venture company, Vebacom, which will
concentrate on the German market and be managed by Veba, and 50% of
another company, Cable &amp; Wireless Europe, to be run by C&amp;W, which will
pursue other opportunities in Europe outside Germany and the UK. Each
company will put their existing telecom interests into the ventures. As
these are small in C&amp;W's case, it will subscribe for new equity in
Vebacom.
British Telecom has pursued a similar path, linking with another
German energy company, Viag. These ventures are by number of companies
which will be jostling for a slice of the big German market when the
monopoly position of the state-owned operator, Deutsche Telekom, ends.
When this occurs has yet to be decided, though it must be by 1998 when
all European Union telecom markets have to be open. Deutsche Telekom
first has to be privatised and this will not happen before next year.
Not all the hopefuls will win licences when liberalisation occurs.
Observers believe three or four licences will be issued at most, so
competition is going to be strong. C&amp;W chairman Lord Young said
yesterday that the joint venture with Veba would continue with or
without a licence. But it is the ambition to be the main rival to
Deutsche Telekom, with 10% of the market by 2003.
The state company is a high-cost operator and will undoubtedly lose
market share heavily. But the hopefuls may be underestimating the
inertia effect of actually getting customers to shift and the ability of
Deutsche Telecom to become more efficient.
C&amp;W's experience with Mercury will come in handy, if only through
enabling its mistakes to be avoided. It was over-ambitious with Mercury
in going for the domestic market, as BT was rapidly improving its act.
So the idea will not be to build a general network but to use existing
distribution systems, such as cable television and add on services to
basic telephony.
Even so, it is all going to cost big money and the unquantifiable
rewards lie years in the future. Vebacom does not even expect to
break-even until it has been operating for five years. C&amp;W expects to
spend #2000m over 10 years in Europe as a whole outside the UK. This
amounts to 10%-15% of the group's planned total expenditure, so should
not present problems.
C&amp;W has a majority share in Hong Kong Telecom and Mercury in the UK,
including the new One-2-One mobile network, but currently has only minor
interests in Europe, generating turnover of #125m. With the coming
liberalisation there will be many opportunities and C&amp;W's international
expertise will help it.
Outsiders are not going to get much of a look-in on wire-based
domestic services whatever the EU rules might say and competition is
going to be fierce in the business and portable segments where C&amp;W can
reasonably expect to find opportunities. Exploiting these will also
depend on finding local partners.
The latest deal is not going to do much to revive C&amp;W's sagging share
price. Down from a high of 543p, it gives the group a capitalisation
little larger than its HK Telecom holding.
The prospect of Veba holding a 10.5% stake is not going to help
because it is subject to a 10-year standstill precluding further
purchases except in the case of a third-party bid for C&amp;W. So the
possibility of a bid cannot be a prop for the shares.

DESPITE publication of higher-than-forecast US durable goods orders
the dollar stayed calm, trading in narrow ranges in European dealings.
Developments in the Mexican financial market are seen as key to the
future short-term direction of the dollar.
A widening of the UK's non-EU trade deficit in December was ignored by
the City who attributed it to the UK economy growing faster than its
rivals. Sentiment towards the pound remains positive ahead of a possible
rise in UK interest rates.
Against the sluggish dollar the pound was steady at $1.5916 but it
lost almost two-thirds-of-a-pfennnig against the German mark to
DM2.4090.
Elsewhere, foreign demand from London and Zurich lifted the South
African financial rand following publication of better-than-expected
December trade figures and a steady consumer price inflation figure.
The Spanish peseta continued to rally following recent intervention by
the Bank of Spain.

THE Stock Exchange is to take more rigorous action to maintain orderly
share markets and protect investors ahead of price-sensitive
information, improving response times after a ''leak'' has taken place.
Concern has been expressed for some time about untoward price
movements ahead of price-sensitive announcements and the Stock
Exchange's move comes after extensive consultation with market
participants and others on the regulation of share dealing.
It is to introduce two measures -- increased use of its existing
authority to declare the price of specific security indicative
(basically warning the market that it is not a firm price) and the
imposition of a trading halt in the relevant shares for up to 24 hours.
Once a security has been declared indicative, market-makers registered
in the affected security are relieved of their obligation to make firm
prices on SEAQ until the share is restored to firm trading. Typically
this is a temporary measure (lasting for minutes or at the most a few
hours) when an announcement is pending and the underlying information
has reached only part of the market.
If, after declaring a security indicative, the company feels unable to
make an announcement, then the Exchange will impose a trading halt as a
last resort to prevent disorderly trading in the shares.
Commenting on the announcement, Michael Lawrence, the Exchange's chief
executive, said: ''Preserving London's reputation as a respected
financial centre is essential. I am determined that the Exchange has
effective arrangements in place to maintain that reputation and that it
is not damaged by people taking advantage of privileged information.''

<HEADLINE>Non-EU trade gap widens sharply to #1051m</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CHRIS STONE</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>19</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980156610</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with non-European Union countries widened
sigificantly in December to #1051m, up from #435m in November, which
itself has been revised upwards from #361m. It is the highest monthly
deficit since February 1993.
Market projections had centred on around #400m to #500m and analysts
were considerably taken aback by the size of the setback though the
authorities sought to play down the significance of one month's figures
taken in isolation.
For 1994 as a whole, the non-EU deficit was #6500m, a reduction of
#2700m on 1993. It was the lowest annual deficit on trade with non-EU
countries since 1987, as the president of the Board of Trade, Michael
Heseltine, was quick to point out.
The fall over the year is attributed equally to changes in the balance
of trade in oil and in finished manufactures.
For December, where the figures undoubtedly took some of the gloss off
the year as a whole, the value of exports fell 5% from #5582m to #5290m,
while imports rose 5[1/2]% from #6017m to #6341m.
In the fourth quarter the visible deficit was #1907m -- nearly double
the deficit of the previous quarter but similar to the average in the
first half of 1994. Exports were unchanged at #16.2bn over the quarter,
while imports rose 5[1/2]% to #18.1bn.
The Central Statistical Office said the trend of the visible balance
suggests a widening in the deficit with little change in exports and an
increase in imports.
Excluding oil -- which posted a deficit of #48m in December compared
to a small surplus in November -- and erratic items defined as ships,
aircraft, precious stones and silver, the volume of exports fell 5% in
December from November's record level, while import volumes were at a
record level, up 7[1/2]% on November.
On the same basis the volume of exports rose 3% in the last quarter of
1994 while imports grew by 6[1/2]%. The latest trends in volume show
export and import values both increasing.
Analysts took a mixed view of the December outcome but the Treasury
stressed that prospects for overseas sales of British products remained
good, citing the increasing export optimism in the CBI'S Quarterly
Industrial Trends Survey earlier this week.
Some analysts, who had of course been wrongfooted over December,
decided that the gap was more likely to be a blip than the start of a
worsening trend.
December's import surge was largely due to a rise in imports of
finished manufactured goods which increased by #378m over November and
also of basic materials, up #62m. The increase in manufactured goods
could be attributed to retailers and wholesalers restocking after low
levels of imports of consumer goods in the middle of last year.
However, Adam Cole of James Capel suggested it could be that we are
going to see an upturn in domestic investment, indicating that firms are
suffering from a capacity shortage.
He thought exports would remain firm, though, especially to the EU
where the recovery is expected to continue.
December's unpleasant surprise package made little impact in financial
markets.

THE future of the IBM plant at Greenock looks assured with IBM United
Kingdom chief executive Javaid Aziz emphasising that it had been
selected as one of the core IBM manufacturing bases for personal
computers -- ''there is no suggestion or hint'' of any cutback.
However, if there is any increase in demand, it will be met through
taking on more short-term contract staff rather than adding to the
permanent workforce, currently around 2000.
IBM UK moved into profit for the first time since 1990 with a massive
swing from operating losses in 1993 of #119m, that being a huge
improvement on the 1992 deficit of #398m into a #176m surplus. That was
on turnover up 8.5% to #4400m.
Export sales increased 8.6% to #2532m of which almost #2000m comes
from Greenock. Prices fell although there was not the ''cataclysmic
decline'' seen in 1993. But it is clear that IBM is not achieving
anything like the same level of margins made at Compaq which has
overtaken IBM as world leader in PC market share.
IBM has seen growth for the first time since 1990 in mainframe
computers with a doubling in volume. That reflected the combination of
large corporate users such as banks and insurance companies requiring
increased capacity and from new products. Some #600m of the #1000m of
supplies sourced in Britain comes from inside Scotland.
There was an increase in restructuring costs from #55m to #80m which
covers the cost of 1500 redundancies, most of which were voluntary, and
the write down on the sale of the Havant disk-drive plant in Hampshire
to a management buy-out which removed another 700 people from the
payroll. Overall UK numbers dropped from 11,418 to 9183 and should be
the end of any significant bloodletting.
The level of employment has fallen in the UK from around 25,000 in
1986 although a substantial proportion of that reflects contracting out
services to other employers.
IBM group revenue rose in 1994 by 6% to $64.1bn with net income of
$3000m (#1920m) so Britain accounts for 11% of sales and 5.2% of income.

A NEW age dawned yesterday for Cadbury Schweppes when it managed to
get the agreement of the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies to its $1711m
(#1076m) cash tender offer.
The City liked what it saw and marked Cadbury shares up 23[1/2]p to
422p on a turnover of 15.3m shares.
At a stroke Cadbury is increasing its share of the #32bn US carbonated
soft drinks industry from 4.9% to 16.3% and into third place behind
Coca-Cola and Pepsi. That means an increase in volume of 75% to over
7000m litres of product as well as greater market share over the two
industry giants in the non-cola sector. That is growing at an annual
rate 7.3% whereas cola improved by just 0.9% with the acquired brands
showing growth of 6.3%.
The pink Dr Pepper, which was created 110 years ago in Waco, Texas,
was likened yesterday by Cadbury chief executive David Wellings to
Vimto, is doing appreciably better than the lemon/lime-based Seven-Up
where Cadbury is buying only the US rights -- Pepsi owns the rights to
the rest of the world.
However, the US accounts for 34% of all global soft drink sales and Dr
Pepper is still largely confined to the southern states so Cadbury has
plenty to work on.
The share price reaction was helped by the rights issue to bring in
#395m -- or about #100m less than indicated on Monday when there was
formal confirmation of the negotiations. Also Cadbury revealed
preliminary results for last year which showed pre-tax profits rising
14% to #475m including a #23m hit on the reorganisation of the Spanish
drinks activities.
There will be a second interim dividend of 11p which will be offered
to shareholders as an underwritten enhanced scrip dividend which will
save #111m cash including #23m of advance corporation tax. This ploy has
reduced the amount of money coming through the rights which is on the
basis of one new share at 340p for every seven held. It is payable in
two instalments. One is 102p and which will take place irrespective of
whether the offer succeeds and a second tranche at 238p when the offer
becomes unconditional.
It appears to be paying a fair price with Dr Pepper achieving
operating profits for 1994 estimated at around $211m (#135m), indicating
that at $33 per share Cadbury is paying 21 times likely earnings. It is
expected to be earnings neutral before reorganisation costs this year
and beneficial thereafter.
That will mean that the soft drinks activities would amount to 62% of
profits and confectionery declining from 48% to 38%.

David Belcher meets a swampland man
ALLIGATORS, tiny silver-stud ones, adorn the leather strap with which
Clarence Gatemouth Brown has been looping an electric guitar round his
neck almost every day for nearly 50 years. He is a Louisiana swampland
man, you see. Still is.
Born there approaching 71 years ago and then raised in Orange on the
Texas side of the Sabine river. Living close to the coast amid acres of
warm, muddy ooze in which alligators, as they have done since times
primordial, float like slow-moving logs.
So it's perhaps not too surprising that a conversation with Gatemouth
Brown is a sluggish thing of drifting pauses, lazy catarrhal growls, and
reluctant reminiscence. No, he'll explain why he got his distinctive
Gatemouth middle-name in his own book, just as soon as he gets the
publisher he needs.
Worked much before with Eric Clapton, prior to being invited to tour
Britain with Eric early next month as his support? ''Sat in on a coupla
toons in N'Awlins not so long ago.''
How many live shows do you do in a year these days, now that you're
not so young as you were when you started off as a teenage drummer with
Howard Spencer and His Gay Swingers, W M Bimbo and His Brownskin Models,
Hort Hudge's Orchestra . . . you must have eased off a little on the gig
front since you formed your own 23-piece orchestra in 1948?
''Two-fifths of 300 days per year, that's when we play. The love of
the people for my music, that's it. They keep me going. It's not like a
job . . . there's no forced retirement.''
Yon Mr Bimbo and those Brownskin Models . . . how much brown skin did
they reveal on stage? Was it a burlesque show? And did your parents
express any concern about their 16-year-old son being exposed to moral
danger?
''Yeah, it was a burlesque road show with a buncha dancers, started in
Indianapolis, Indiana. My mom never did say anything about it. My dad
told me to go for it.''
His dad gave him his grounding in music, too. Wide-ranging.
Free-thinking. Broad-based. The blues, for sure, but everything else in
addition to the blues. No stereotyping. ''I play American music,
Texas-style,'' he insists. ''I hate to hear myself playing the same
thing all night.
''It would frustrate me. It would frustrate the audience. I do
different styles of music.'' Live, in his trademark black cowboy hat,
Gatemouth Brown is therefore as likely to assay Duke Ellington's Take
The A Train as he is a shuffle-boogie version of Bill Doggett's Honky
Tonk.
True to the same spirit of musical variety, Gatemouth's forthcoming
album, The Man, features contrasting songs by John D. Loudermilk and
Delbert McClinton, along with helpings of cajun sauce and bluegrass
seasoning. It mixes country and western swing a la Hank Williams with
zydeco two-step; adds a Latin flavour to Unchained Melody; and lightly
funkifies a Louis Jordan calypso. Similarly, as well as playing guitar,
Clarence can be heard on his new LP demonstrating his easy prowess with
the viola and the fiddle.
Horns are never far from his mind, either. ''I play my guitar to make
it sound like a horn, horn riffs. It's difficult. You have to be more
fluid.''
It's a guitar sound which has had its effect on Gatemouth Brown's
successors, players like Johnny Guitar Watson, Freddie King, Albert
Collins. It's also a guitar sound which shared some of its modern urban
Texan blues roots with T-Bone Walker, with whom Gatemouth's path
memorably crossed in Houston one night in 1947 when he was in the city
for his debut recording session.
''It was in a club. The Bronze Peacock. T-Bone had a residency there,
and he was taking a break in his dressing-room because he had this
health problem with an ulcer, and I got on the stage and picked up his
guitar and made up a song. 'My name is Gatemouth Brown. I just got in
your town. If you don't like my style, I will not hang around.'
''T-Bone wasn't pleased. He wasn't that mad, but he didn't like it too
well. He wasn't the type you could be real friends with.''
Since 1947, music-lovers with no inclination towards facile
categorisation have been making friends with such Gatemouth Brown songs
as Rock My Blues Away, My Time Is Expensive, Okie-Dokie Stomp, and
Atomic Energy. Six decades on, his new album continues the process.
Gatemouth Brown. Float like an alligator, play guitar like a chap who
can still teach Eric Clapton a thing or two . . .
* The Man is released by Verve on February 13, two days before
Clarence Gatemouth Brown supports Eric Clapton at Glasgow's SECC, the
first date on Clapton's UK tour. Additionally, Gatemouth Brown's vintage
work can be heard on a variety of compilation albums on the Rounder and
Red Lightning labels.

SCOTTISH doctor Richard McGown yesterday began a six-month prison
sentence in Zimbabwe after he was refused leave to appeal against his
conviction for the culpable homicide of two young patients.
Lawyers said he was ''shell-shocked'' by the decision of High Court
Judge Paddington Garwe, but still hoped that the case could be heard by
the country's Supreme Court.
However, one of McGown's attorneys, Mr Howard Thompson, conceded
yesterday that it might take several weeks before Chief Justice Anthony
Gubbay gave a ruling on whether the appeal should go ahead.
Even if it does, the Supreme Court is unlikely to give an immediate
decision on what had been a lengthy and complex trial, said Mr Thompson.
With remission, McGown could be released from Harare's Central Prison
in four months and, given the racial tension which the case has
provoked, the Zimbabwean authorities are thought unlikely to reverse
Judge Garwe's findings speedily, if at all.
On Wednesday, the 58-year-old anaesthetist was told by Judge Garwe
that he was guilty of gross negligence in the treatment of two children,
one black and the other Asian. He had given them large doses of morphine
during routine operations, and they later died.
McGown, who was born in India of Scottish parents, and educated in
Glasgow and Edinburgh, was yesterday being taken to Harare's Central
Prison, to begin his sentence, which includes a hard labour stipulation.
He grasped at the hand of his wife Sheena, as a court orderly led him
down steps to basement holding cells in the High Court.
Mr Thompson said: ''Naturally, he is shell-shocked. But he is a man of
some fortitude, and is putting a brave face on it.''
A small group of black students gathered outside the courthouse, but
dispersed before McGown boarded a prison truck. Protesters' spokesman Mr
Larry Chakaredza said: ''The sentence was too light, but we expected
that. We are pleased to see him go to the cells.''

Rob Adams describes a musician's late call
DON'T call us, we'll call you is usually a hollow way of saying forget
it -- but in Jimmy Hastings's case the call came, although it's a good
job he didn't hold his breath.
Hastings auditioned as a tenor saxophonist/clarinettist with the
Humphrey Lyttelton Band in 1959 and was passed over. Then two years ago
the position fell vacant again and Hastings, not a man to bear a
long-term grudge, was happy to step in.
In the intervening years he had kept busy on London's sessions and
West End shows circuit while quietly building a reputation in jazz's
inner circle for his warm-toned tenor playing, especially in his duo and
quartet with pianist John Horler, guesting regularly on BBC Radio's Jazz
Club.
His CV includes gigs with ''royalty'' (Sarah Vaughan and Frank
Sinatra) and equally unforgettable experiences such as Rolling Stone
Charlie Watt's Big Band, which brought together as interesting a
collection of diverse personalities as the British jazz scene has ever
produced and -- no mean achievement -- toured America.
From the late 1960s Hastings also worked with several of the bands
from the Canterbury Scene, including Hatfield and the North and Caravan.
The latter featured his younger brother, guitarist Pye, and Hastings
recalls appearing with them on BBC2's forerunner to the Old Grey Whistle
Test, wearing an extravagant hat -- not as any gesture towards millinery
chic but to ''hide my bald spot and not look too old, although I wasn't
that much older than the others''.
Quintessentially English these bands may have been, but Hastings is
actually an Aberdonian by birth and laid the foundations of his musical
career in the perhaps unlikely setting of Tomintoul, where he started
playing piano at the age of three.
In his teens he played accordion for local dances before, inspired by
hearing records by Gerry Mulligan and -- the big influence -- Eddie
Lockjaw Davis with the Basie Orchestra, he decided to become a
saxophonist. He had no sooner bought his first saxophone when he learned
a lesson that comes back to haunt him still.
''I saw an advertisement for a sax player in the Beach Ballroom band
and I thought all I had to do was go along and sit there looking the
part,'' he recalls. The bandleader put him straight. ''It's all the same
whether it's Carnegie Hall, New York, or the Beach Ballroom, Aberdeen.
How do you get there? Practice.''
* Jimmy Hastings plays with the Humphrey Lyttelton Band and special
guest Joe Temperley at Aberdeen Music Hall, Thursday February 2;
Edinburgh Queen's Hall, Friday February 3; and Glasgow City Hall,
Saturday February 4.

THE North of England was braced for more snow and ice last night after
a sudden white-out that turned roads into ice rinks and left thousands
of motorists stranded.
Meanwhile, two climbers were rescued in the Highlands yesterday after
falling in separate incidents. One of the men, stranded on an icy ledge
on Ben Nevis, was saved after two Lochaber mountain rescue team members
dangled at the end of a 1500ft rope to reach him.
Last night police in Yorkshire were warning drivers to take extra
care, and feared a spate of accidents, with roads covered in sheet ice.
Four people died in West Yorkshire on Wednesday night and yesterday
amid some of the worst snowfalls there for many years. Drivers abandoned
their cars and took shelter in theatres and local authority buildings.
At the height of the white-out more than 5000 vehicles were stranded
on the M62.
A group of children from Warrington spent the night at the Eureka
children's museum in Halifax. The museum said they would now be making
plans for future overnight stays.
One of the four victims who collapsed in the snow was Mr John Akam,
64, of Larkfield Drive, Rawdon, Leeds. He was found early yesterday in
Layton Lane, Rawdon, but was dead on arrival at hospital.
Another victim, in Halifax, had abandoned his own car and was helping
to push another car when he collapsed.
Last night weather forecasters warned of further severe snowfalls
today -- and defended their failure to predict the severity of the
weather on Wednesday night.
More than 14 inches of snow fell then in a few hours, just as
commuters were leaving for home.
The Leeds Weather Centre said it was impossible to predict the full
extent of the snowstorms, although snow had been expected.
One forecaster said: ''We have all this high technology equipment --
but we still rely on observers to tell us what the weather is actually
doing, up-wind if you like.
''All the time (on Wednesday) we were looking at rain turning to snow
at various levels. Up in the Pennines, particularly where we have few
observations, it was unclear as to what was actually happening.''
Last night traffic on the M62 was said to be moving slowly. Apart from
the motorway and the A62, all other routes across the Pennines remained
closed.
In Scotland yesterday two Lochaber mountain rescue team members
dangled at the end of a 1500ft rope to reach one climber stranded on an
icy ledge on the north face of Ben Nevis.
After a 10-hour operation involving 17 members of the team, Mr Mark
Slater, 25, from Cardiff, was brought down safely and uninjured.
And a Royal Navy rescue helicopter and members of Glencoe mountain
rescue team were involved in the rescue of Mr Thomas Ferguson, of Wells
Brae, Innerleithen, who had fallen in Crowberry gully on Buachaille
Etive Mor in Glencoe.
Mr Ferguson, who was climbing alone, was seen to fall an estimated 800
metres by a party of Navy ratings on a training exercise, who raised the
alarm on their mobile telephone. His injuries were not believed to be
life-threatening.

Sara Villiers reports on a put-upon profession
BEING beaten, stripped and humiliated might not sound like ideal
working conditions to most of us but for one put-upon profession it can
all be in a day's work; an actor's lot is not a happy one. While critics
foam at the mouth over Sarah Kane's Blasted at the Royal Court Upstairs
we should spare a thought for those called upon to enact its
masturbation, fellatio, defecation, and homosexual rape.
Mind you, Pip Donaghy, who plays the gruesome middle-aged hack in
Blasted does not show unique bravado in relieving himself onstage; an
actor from The People's Show performed that particular theatrical
speciality some years ago and ''excrement'' has since hit the
floorboards around the nations's theatres with alarming alacrity.
So, are there any lines which actors won't cross in pursuit of the
famed smelly greasepaint and roaring crowds, or is this an
''anything-goes'' culture? ''It's certainly changed days since Hair and
Oh Calcutta! appeared in the West End and everyone freaked about
nudity,'' muses Martin Brown, spokesman for the actors' union Equity.
''We do have clauses about nudity and simulated sex to protect actors
but ultimately it's a personal decision.''
Stage actors, who don't have the Hollywood ''body double'' option, are
increasingly having to show all to secure a part. Getting your kit off
was once confined to Soho's stages but is now practically passe.
Scottish actress Katherine Howden had to disrobe continually throughout
Brad Fraser's Poor Superman! at the Traverse last year as well as
simulating fellatio, as did Irene Macdougall in Fraser's Unidentified
Human Remains.
When Gerry Mulgrew, artistic director of Communicado, appeared in the
company's A Place with the Pigs he had to undergo the degradation of
racing around the stage nude and being vigorously beaten on the
backside. ''Mind you I think he quite enjoyed it,'' revealed a
Communicado source.
Harry Gibson is currently directing a new adaptation of Trainspotting
for the Citizens' and delicately negotiating with his cast over the
nudity. An actor himself, he has previously stood up and been counted on
this issue. In 1983 he appeared nude in Unspeakable Acts, at the Henry
Clurman Theatre on 42nd Street, New York, and was subjected to the
scutiny of the city authorities. ''They had to check that my manhood
wasn't in any way, shape or form tumescent,'' he says.
Even seemingly innocent acts can be approached with trepidation by
actors who know they have to do the same thing night after night. The
cast of A Cow Jumped Over The Moon, at the Traverse in 89, soon piled on
the inches after eating a full cooked breakfast during every performance
of a six-week tour. And while the audience might have licked their lips
watching Lewis Howden down three cans of lager during Stuart Hepburn's
Loose Ends at the Traverse in 93, Howden fretted that his performance
would be impaired.
''Food can be the worst,'' agrees Andy Arnold, artistic director of
the Arches Theatre Company. ''When I directed Twiglet Anyone? at the
Fringe one actor's role involved a forfeit -- swallowing three raw eggs.
He used to crack the eggs into a saucepan before the play to check that
none of them was off.''
Arnold himself has tasted such bitter success. ''Children love grotty
food stuff. When I performed in a kids' show I used to spread a sandwich
with marmalade, raw egg, brown sauce, and then smother it with sugar.''
And eat the vile thing? ''Of course,'' he says. Suffering for your art
indeed.

THE return of Sir Peter Hall, Julian Glover, and Hugh Quarshie to
Stratford, David Troughton as Richard III, Josie Lawrence as Kate in
Taming of the Shrew, a revival of Goethe's Faust directed by Michael
Bogdanov and Adrian Noble directing up-and-coming young actress Lucy
Whybrow in his first Romeo and Juliet are some of the highlights of the
new 1995/96 season announced by RSC artistic director Adrian Noble
yesterday.
London will also get a chance to enjoy two of the most exciting
classical performances of the 1994 season when Iain Glen repeats his
Henry V at the Barbican in September and Orgilus in an acclaimed
production by Michael Boyd (artistic director of the Tron in Glasgow) of
John Ford's The Broken Heart in June.
Describing 1994 as ''very gratifying'' (overall attendances were 82%
with 20,000 more visitors to the main Royal Shakespeare Theatre), an
ebullient Noble outlined what looks set to be an even more action-packed
year: increased regional (though sadly not Scottish) and international
touring, a four-month summer season residency at London's Young Vic and
revivals in London and Stratford of Calderon, Jonson, Vanbrugh,
Osborne's A Patriot For Me, Edward Bond's Bingo, Dennis Potter's The Son
of Man and Nigel Williams's adaptation of William Golding's Lord of the
Flies as a community based production in Stratford.
In London, Nick Dear's new play, The Zenobia (his The Art of Success,
directed by Noble, was considered one of the highlights of the 1980s) is
scheduled for the small studio space, The Pit.
Meanwhile in Stratford, Sir Peter Hall will direct his first Julius
Caesar with John Nettles returning to play Brutus alongside Hugh
Quarshie as Mark Antony and Julian Glover as Cassius.
Last year's Stratford season, one of the most successful in recent
memory which includes two of the outstanding new plays of last year --
Anne Devlin's After Easter starring Greenock-born Stella Gonet and David
Edgar's Pentecost -- moves lock stock and barrel to London. The RSC
currently enjoys a generous and obviously flourishing relationship with
the drinks firm Allied Domecq to the tune of #3.3m over three years.

ONE hundred and fifty employees were evacuated when fire broke out at
the Gray Dunn and Company biscuit factory in Glasgow's Kinning Park at
4.30pm yesterday. More than 100 firefighters battled for ninety minutes
to bring the blaze under control. A huge pall of black smoke covered the
area, with police warning motorists on the nearby M8 of zero visibility.
No-one was injured. The cause of the blaze, which started in a building
housing gas ovens before ripping through the ground floor of the main
block, is not yet known.

DESPITE her protests to the contrary, Scottish playwright Sharman
Macdonald is very much returning to the territory of her first hit When
I Was A Girl I Used to Scream and Shout in this depiction of four
couples in a West Coast seaside town.
Perhaps because she has depicted so many of these scenes before --
resentments festering in mother-daughter dependency, pouty adolescent
sexuality, youngsters joshing bodily functions -- the interactions seem
tired, as when Phyllida Law as Elspeth rounds furiously on her daughter
Frances (Sian Thomas) to list her maternal sacrifices in an exposition
which should have been moving but instead seems hackneyed.
The play depicts four separate, rarely inter-connecting relationships,
and is constantly on the brink of becoming cluttered, a weakness
exaggerated by Alan Rickman's direction; as the focus turns from one duo
to another characters often loiter, distractingly, onstage. A saving
grace is that the play is imbued with warmth and likeable humour; the
tart dialogue between the obit-obsessed old ladies Lily (Sheila Reid)
and Chloe (Sandra Voe) is dark with black comedy and Macdonald captures
the quicksilver moods so particular to young children in her portraits
of the young boys Tom and Sam.
However, the atmosphere of poignancy which is attempted seems forced
and unconvincing -- the boys' dialogue abruptly veering from believable
banter to stylised utterances. The most delightful aspect is the
ingenious design by Robin Don which brings a poetry to the production
which the script fails to provide.

SOMEWHERE, beneath the cool, intellectual surface control in Sally
Beamish's music, lies passion. Last night, in a brilliant Cutting Edge
programme with the BBC SSO in storming form under conductor Martyn
Brabbins, Beamish unleashed passion and rage in her new violin concerto,
given a stunning debut by soloist Anthony Marwood.
What a piece. Inspired by Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the
Western Front, Beamish has crafted a vivid concerto that is immediately
graphic -- the percussion and brass explosions, and the anguished
yelping of the soloist, were mind-numbing -- and at the same time
contains layers of subtlety and complexity that will take time to
fathom.
The alternation of chaos and reflectiveness in the first movement,
with the simmering anger of its cadenza, and the intense melancholy of
the slow movement (with the cimbalom setting folksy wisps of melody in
ice) formed compelling dramatic images. The finale, with its pawky
bravado, hints of sentimentality, spectral waltz, and relentless
juggernaut of a march, just blew me away. Superb playing from all. Can't
wait to hear it again.
More dazzling playing in the second half, this time from fearsome
Fifer John Wallace, whose stellar trumpet solos in Harrison Birtwistle's
Endless Parade -- wonderfully sustained in every range of the instrument
-- characterised a radiant performance of this kaleidoscopic piece.
Less impressive, other than in its sheer dexterity of textures, was
Birtwistle's Still Movement for 13 strings. Walton's Second Symphony,
however, in a convulsive, opulent, and blazing performance, was a
reminder of the sumptuous acoustic that lies in the City Hall.

LEGACY OF THE HOLOCAUST: On the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation
of Auschwitz, Herald writers examine the darkest chapter in European
history
FIFTY years ago on January 27 Russian infantry of General Kurochkin's
60th Army, racing westwards, entered Auschwitz-Birkenau, a vast military
industrial complex and extermination camp in south-western Poland. The
largest and, more than any of the other 135 death camps established by
the Nazis, the one which has come to symbolise mass murder, it had been
set up in the summer of 1940. It was not intended as a place of murder,
and not specifically for Jews, but as a labour camp whose first inmates
were Poles.
Its functions grew as did its size, especially after the Wannsee
Conference of 1942, the meeting which decided how the Final Solution,
the extermination of Europe's Jews, was to progress. A vast extension
was under construction as late as 1944.
Auschwitz was a railway junction in 1940 and its camps became the
centre of a web of European railway connections along which Jews and
others were transported to their death, usually by gassing in large
specially designed and constructed chambers. It was here that
crystallised prussic acid (Cyclon B) was first used experimentally on
Russian prisoners of war and Jews. It proved to be far more efficient
than carbon monoxide poisoning from the engines of special travelling
vans containing victims in a sealed compartment, as used at Chelmno:
Cyclon B became the preferred means of death. Though every other form of
murder known to man was used, none could achieve the totals afforded by
gassing, and this system did not induce psychological trauma among the
executioners as did mass shootings.
The Russians did not see things at their worst, for the extermination
work had been halted on Himmler's orders at the end of the previous
October; in November the process of dismantling the gas chambers and
their associated crematoria had also started. All the documentary
evidence (or as much as could be assembled) was burned, and great
efforts were made to conceal the nature of the establishment, by
rudimentary landscaping and new grassing.
These measures did not work. As well as the actual survivors,
notebooks and letters, buried by their writers, were later turned up.
Three of the four gas chambers were completely destroyed and there was a
sustained attempt by Nazi apologists later to deny their very existence,
and even to claim that what was preserved was a deliberate British
construction to mislead world opinion. Given the secrecy with which
everything had been conducted, these views persisted for doubters until
last year when the KGB archives revealed the designs for the chambers,
their ordering and their delivery to the camps. The Polish historian who
uncovered this data had previously refused to accept the reality of the
chambers: he changed his mind at once.
Living testaments to Auschwitz's reality -- the remaining inmates --
had mostly been marched westwards to ''safer'' locations inside Germany
itself where none of the extermination camps had ever been located,
though the earliest Jewish gassing in 1940 had taken place there at
Bernberg, south of Berlin. The enforced marchers, dreadfully
under-nourished and often already ill, died en route in their thousands;
survivors carried diseases, like typhus, with them.
The Russians encountered a few hundred gypsies in the camp -- they,
like the Jews, had been victims of Nazi racial hatred, destined also for
extermination. Most of the other prisoners were gone (though Otto Frank,
father of the famous Ann, was still there, alive); but in some
storehouses, which had escaped SS attempts to burn them, they came
across more than 800,000 women's dresses, 350,000 men's suits.
Auschwitz was a labour camp as well as a death camp. It was there that
Oscar Schindler, the industrialist, was to work to save life; and Josef
Mengele, the doctor, to take it. Because only the live can work, many
more people (some thousands) survived Auschwitz than the four pure
extermination camps elsewhere in Poland: only two appear to have
survived Belzec, three, Chelmno; fewer than 40, Treblinka; well under
1000, Sobibor. To put these figures into some kind of perspective,
400,000 were killed at Chelmno; at Belzec more than 600,000 people were
killed; at Treblinka 800,000. Estimates for Auschwitz suggest that
somewhere between 700,000 and 1.5 million were murdered.
Trains arriving at Auschwitz were rapildy emptied, their human cargo
being quickly divided into those who could work and those who could not
-- infants, children, many women, the old and the infirm. The first
category was safe, for a time; the second was marched, or carried in
lorries, at once to the gas chambers. Descriptions of this process are
numerous and harrowing.
How is it all to be assessed, this unparalleled experience in Europe's
history? It has to confronted -- and it mostly has in Germany -- and
must never be forgotten. The case for a permanent museum at Auschwitz is
unquestionable, to testify to the power of unreason, and its evil, in
European culture. Our remembrance this week is vital. Many people, many
victims, could not accept the reality of extermination camps half a
century ago.
What may even be harder to grasp is the quality of the perpetrators.
Christopher Browning has shown, in one detailed study, how mass killers
could be ordinary men forced by peer pressure to murder. Many indeed in
the extermination camps were riff raff, often criminals, often not
German at all, but enthusiastic participants from the Ukraine,
Lithuania, and Poland. The leaders were, however, entirely German, often
professionals with sound academic records, but inspired by Hitler. That
many were medics possessed of the ''ability'' to identify ''worthless
life'' and trained at first in the euthanasia of mentally and physically
handicapped Germans should qualify any automatic respect for degrees and
doctors among Europeans.
There is one area of hope. Although much of the Jewish culture of
central and eastern Europe is now lost, the Jewish people has survived.
Badly bruised, as the history of Israel shows, Jewish humanity
flourishes still, a saving remnant which is trying to re-establish in
the Middle East its liberal identity for which the Nazis hated it.

FOR 50 years Hania Kestenberg has been piecing together a series of
dramatic scenes etched into her brain by fear and still wakes at night
to the terror of knowing that what happened between 1940 and 1945 is as
real as her present life as a suburban grandmother.
''The only reason I talk about it now is because they say it never
happened. We lived with it and we still have the fear it could happen
here. It can happen any time,'' she says.
She has a recurring dream from which she wakes screaming: ''I am
walking up a horrible road with buildings full of black holes. There are
six ladies behind me and I walk with each one before she falls into one
of the holes in the road. It is all quite horrific and the last one I
walk with is a woman without a face.''
Hania was about two -- although she has no way now of knowing her
exact age -- when her mother and father were forced to move from their
flat in the centre of Warsaw to the ghetto.
''Under the eaves there was a false wall. There was a sink with a
cupboard underneath which concealed a small hole through which we had to
crawl. There were a lot of people hidden there: children, mothers with
babies, and grown-ups. We heard the Germans coming. They were running up
the stairs and we could hear them walking around the room and speaking
in German. One of the babies started to cry, so the mother put her hand
over his mouth and later when she took her hand away he was all limp. He
died from lack of air. I remember screaming and my parents telling me
the baby was asleep, but I knew he was dead.
''In another hiding place there were bales of dirty washing and
underneath all these laundry bales there was a small hiding place for
me, my parents, my aunt, uncle and two cousins.
''They came with dogs, great big alsatians with pinky, purply tongues
hanging out. I was terrified of all dogs. I had been put at the very
edge and this dog went straight there, but for unexplained reasons,
which I can only say must have been a miracle from God, it went away
again and the soldiers just turned round and followed the dog. I could
have touched that dog. I could smell him. I don't know why he did not
give us away, but I have never been afraid of dogs since.
''The main place I remember was one my father found. It was an alcove
in the wall, specially built for the Passover dishes which were stored
away for the rest of the year. My mother and I, and the old lady who
lived next door with her grandson, hid in the cupboard which had
decorative holes for ventilation.
''My father was working in one of the clothing factories and had been
told to bring his family to the factory if there was any action. My
mother and I ran very quickly to get into the factory but there were
guards outside and we couldn't get in. The way back was blocked by
Germans but we ran down an alleyway up the back stairs and my mother put
me in the hiding place. I said I was thirsty. She heated some milk -- I
could smell it and through the holes in the door I saw her put it in a
bottle. There were noises on the stairs; they came in and marched my
mother out. She did not say a word, she did not look towards where I
was, she went as if she was going for a walk with these two young
Germans. That was the last time I ever saw her.
''My father came home and I remember him walking up and down for
hours, with me clinging on to him, but he recovered and planned straight
away for my getaway. He told me I was going to go to the other side and
he started teaching me Polish prayers as well as my Hebrew prayers. He
told me: 'Hebrew you think inside your head, Polish you say aloud.
Hebrew you have to remember, otherwise people will not know who you are,
they will not know you are Jewish.'
''It was winter. I had a red coat with fur on it and I was wearing two
sets of clothing and my doll's pram was also packed with clothing and
had extra material to make clothes for me to grow into.''
After a long walk ending in negotiations with a German soldier, Hania
was handed over to a woman she recognised as her mother's dressmaker.
The last she saw of her father was his tall, thin figure disappearing.
He never looked back.
She was eventually taken to the small village of Anin outside Warsaw
and became Danusia Zanowska, which was the name of the granddaughter of
the old lady she called Auntie Marisia.
She had a brief taste of running about in the fresh air until
neighbours began to question the presence of a child known to be in
Warsaw. It was to be another two years before she was allowed outside
again.
''Auntie Marisia found me a hiding place on the floor under an old tin
bath of the sort you see in old films. I sat under there for two years
with a table placed on top. During bombardments I would be there by
myself. When the Germans came to search the house, she used to offer
them raspberry juice and they would sit at the table and put their feet
on the bath. If you want to know what that sounds like, put a bucket
over your head and hit it with sticks.''
The dream still reels relentlessly through Hania's nights. ''It is
always exactly the same, the only difference is that I am trying to
speed it up because I know that the last lady will be OK and I want to
get to her.''
The last lady, who starts with a blank face, is her English adoptive
mother, Tziviah (Tilly) Barber. She was adopted by the Barbers as a
result of a powerful affinity recognised almost instantly by the then
nine-year-old Hania and her new mother and remained happily with them
until she married.
She has a son and daughter, now grown and married and with children of
their own, whose photographs have joined those of her father and
grandfather unearthed by distant relatives. ''A few grandchildren are so
little compared with the huge family of grandparents, parents, aunts,
uncles, cousins we lost.''

John Linklater in Berlin
IN BERLIN they have excavated the bureacratic origins of the Holocaust
and raised a political embarrassment. It is an open site on the blighted
corridor running alongside a surviving stretch of the Berlin Wall, a
muddy desolation with scrubby birch trees, mounds of raw earth and some
exposed building foundations. Until 1945 this was the headquarters of
the Gestapo, the SS, the Security Service (SD) and the Nazi State
Security Department.
It was a complex that grew in proportion to the industry of terror and
genocide it generated. The Gestapo took over the former School of
Applied Arts and Design in Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse in 1933. Heinrich
Himmler took his offices next door in the former Hotel Prinz Albrecht
from 1934. Reinhard Heydrich had his desk at the former Prinz Albrecht
Palais, 102 Wilhelmstrasse, and from here he prepared his presentation
to the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, outlining the plan to
exterminate 11 million European Jews.
By the time Adolf Eichmann was appointed to run the Jewish Desk, to
administer the time-tabling of Auschwitz and the Final Solution, he had
to be moved to overspill annexes some 700 yards away. But he retained
the same postal address at 8 Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse. Among Jews and
political dissidents, it was the most feared address in Berlin.
Nothing now remains of any of these buildings except photographs, some
records, and a few of their foundations. The headquarters had been
heavily bombed and the last inmates of the interrogation and torture
cells were shot one week before Berlin surrendered on May 2, 1945. Then
began decades of forgetting.
Amid the post-war rubble it was convenient to designate the former SS
headquarters buildings as candidates for the bulldozer. Little public
awareness attended their demolition in 1949. No acknowledgment was made
of any connection with the genocide of European Jewry.
Exposure of the ugly historical role of the site came in the 1980s. It
had been used to house temporary exhibitions, and the architectural
historian Dieter Hoffmann Axthelm led objections to a proposed road
extension that would have obliterated the last traces. The demand grew
for a memorial to the ''victims of fascism'', a semi-euphemism which
appeased German sensitivity over the Holocaust by incorporating the
tragedy with the bravery of the political opponents of the Third Reich.
Within this compromise of terminology lies a political embarrassment
which the site encapsulates. It is a perfect illustration of the German
difficulty in confronting the legacy of Auschwitz. Even this week, when
German television and newspapers have carried an unprecedented level of
discussion on the issue, there is a fear that many regard it as a
penance of conscience. A distasteful obligation to be got out of the way
and once again forgotten.
In 1982 the West German House of Representatives voted to erect a
memorial on the site. The Berlin Senate agreed to invite entries in a
competition to decide the nature of the memorial, but there were two
contradictory stipulations. The winner would have to ''harmonise the
deep historical significance of the site'' with a completely separate
function as a landscaped park open to the public.
Unsurprisingly, the winning entry raised furious objections. The
Jewish community said there was too much park and not enough memorial.
German amnesia found too much memorial and not enough park. The project
was scrapped in 1984. A ''provisional re-structuring'' of the site was
agreed in 1987.
It was supposed to be a temporary solution. The success and
international recognition of the Topographie Des Terrors exhibition on
the site, housed in the excavated basement of the demolished Gestapo HQ
and roofed over to display photographs and records, took the local
authorities by surprise. It remains in place today, along with
additional landscaping of the site, tablets providing information on
individual buildings and a panoramic platform raised on one of the
mounds. Parties of German schoolchildren are among the most regular
groups of visitors to the muddy site. It combines an uneasy atmosphere:
in appearance almost medievally distanced; with a weight of
documentation that chillingly evokes the meticulous planning and
bureaucracy of the Holocaust. Yet it is no memorial.
The new plan is to erect a new building on the site to enlarge the
documentation, house a research base on the institutions and structure
of the SS, and host conferences. Work begins in May, with a 1997
completion date. The question of a memorial appears to have been shelved
as too difficult to resolve.

THERE'S little doubt that Tony Blair spoke for most people when he
tore into the Government over its refusal to halt the looting of public
utilities. The Labour leader is at his best when confronted with
straightforward moral issues, like a man more at home in the pulpit than
at the despatch box, and they don't come much plainer than executive
avarice.
Blair's disgust was palpable and potent. Yet there were, as ever,
pragmatic reasons for his indignation, however righteous. Given his
well-documented campaign against public ownership, the Opposition leader
can hardly afford to appear soft on the excesses -- such a polite word
for a scandal -- of privatised industry.
Labour's left, such as remains, is watching him almost as intently as
the Government watches him. As Liberals will tell you, the man who
occupies the middle ground risks being squeezed. Nevertheless, you can't
help but feel Blair is shaping a rod for his own back. While launching a
nation-wide campaign to destroy (and let's forget the semantics) Clause
4, he is simultaneously grappling with the corruption that the Webbs'
declaration was designed to end.
To the question, ''Well, what would you do?'' Labour has, for the time
being, a perfectly good answer, yet it is the one response the party's
leader refuses to give.
We are led to believe it will all be different when Blair wins. The
fat cats -- why drag felines into an argument about vermin? -- will be
put in their place. Partnership will replace private greed. Enterprise
will remain free, not least from the fear of nationalisation, and a
vigilant Labour government will make sure that a bunch of suits can no
longer become millionaires by selling us things we once owned.
How, precisely? Moral pressure, a good talking to, the Government
throwing its weight around? Blair has been careful to avoid offering an
alternative to Clause 4 not, you suspect, because he is less capable
than the dear old Webbs of generating windy prose, but because any draft
he puts forward must explain -- and explain quite specifically -- how a
Labour government would exercise the control of which he speaks. That's
the heart of the matter.
The men who run the privatised utilities are not making it up when
they say they have a legal obligation to their shareholders. That's the
nature of business: control is only available to owners, and owners can
do pretty much as they please. If they instruct their managers to
achieve as big a return as the market will bear, have no qualms about
how returns are achieved, and choose to reward those managers lavishly
for doing the dirty work, there is not a lot anyone else can do about
it.
Granted, a government can make life difficult for any company, but is
it seriously suggested by anyone in the Shadow Cabinet that, say,
British Gas could be brought to heel? One of the biggest companies in
Europe, with global ambitions, will always plead responsibility to
shareholders. It will be right, too.
That, not specious talk of modernisation, is the reality Blair has to
confront as he campaigns across the country trying to talk a reluctant
party into throwing away the biggest weapon in its armoury. If he is as
outraged as he seems to be about privatised greed what, precisely, does
he plan to do? If not the principles of Clause 4, then what? Somehow a
decent Christian example doesn't sound like something they are liable to
comprehend in the boardrooms.
Thus we arrive at a situation in which John Major can accuse his
opponent of plotting ''nationalisation'' while many in the Labour Party
accuse him of abject surrender to privatisation. The best Blair's allies
can come up with is the chant that public ownership would be too
expensive and the tired old threat to dissidents to shut up if they want
to win the next election. Effective in a conference brawl, perhaps, but
little use in government.
The truth seems to be -- and we may call the ''wobble'' over rail
privatisation in evidence -- that the Labour leader would prefer to do
as little as possible beyond issuing ritual condemnations of a greed so
blatant even its practitioners have the good grace to look shifty. He
may pay lip service to public ownership but he has no intention of
turning it into an election issue. That isn't his kind of socialism.
Yet the evidence is that most people believe there are some things too
important to be left to the market; services which cannot be judged by
their profitability alone; services, indeed, which rot on contact with
market philosophies. The vandalism being practised on the NHS is one
example; water privatisation in England and Wales another; the railways
(coming soon to a siding near you) almost certainly a third.
There's little point in mincing words: what we have in Mr Blair is the
most right-wing leader the Labour Party has ever seen. All his instincts
rebel against the very ideas of common ownership, state responsibilities
and real economic justice. He talks of these things effortlessly and
endlessly but they are not of his world. He is moderate -- that
condition of nullity -- by nature, not just because he wishes to win an
election.
As he treks the land cajoling and bullying his party into giving him
his way, we should bear in mind what might be called the depreciation of
commitment. It's a familiar thought: if this is what Blair's like now,
imagine how he will behave in government?
The Labour leader likes to say he will make no promises he cannot
keep. It sounds like a fine, honest sentiment. Then again, it could just
be a way of saying he intends to do nothing very much at all.

ANNUAL inflation in the European Union rose marginally last month. At
3.1%, it was back to the level of last July and August, which had
followed a short period at 3%, the lowest rate for seven and a half
years.
Figures issued by the EU's Luxembourg-based statistical office,
Eurostat, showed a steady fall over the past five years. In December
1993 it was 3.4%, in 1991 it was 4.7%, and in 1990 it was 5.7%.
France (1.6%) had the lowest inflation of the 12 EU member states in
December. Britain, following a rise from 2.6% in November, is now closer
to the average with 2.9%.
The EU has since taken in Austria, Finland, and Sweden. Only Portugal,
Italy, Spain, and Greece are above the EU average.
Other figures: Belgium 1.9%, Luxembourg 2%, Denmark 2.3%, Ireland
(November) 2.4%, Netherlands 2.6%, Germany 2.7%. These compare with US
inflation at 2.7% and Japan at 0.5%.
Eurostat reported that in the past 15 years the inflation trends in
the three new EU members, which joined on January 1, were similar to
those in the 12.
Rates peaked after the second world oil crisis in 1979/80, and
declined steadily from 1981 to 1986. They rose steadily to peak again
during the Gulf crisis in 1990.

OPPONENTS of the plan by ScottishPower to build a 40-mile line of
electricity pylons across South Ayrshire were dealt a blow yesterday,
when a Government representative rejected their submissions.
At a public inquiry in Ayr, Mr James McCulloch, Scottish Office
Reporter, ruled against the admission of three precognitions by
objectors to the scheme to build an interconnector between Scotland and
Northern Ireland, which were submitted after the agreed closing date.
In a five-page ruling on the admissibility of the evidence contained
in the precognitions, Mr McCulloch recalled that it had been agreed by
everyone involved in the inquiry that precognitions were to be exchanged
by September 13 last year.
The Reporter added that following publication of an edited version of
a report on the project by consultants Ove Arup, he had allowed parties
to prepare supplementary evidence, which was to be available by December
16.
Mr McCulloch said he had reviewed what was said in the inquiry earlier
in the day, and in particular the argument put forward by Mr Donald
MacKay, QC, for ScottishPower, that the three precognitions should be
thrown out on procedural grounds.
The Reporter said he was not inclined to throw them out on procedural
grounds.
He added that the next step was to consider if the precognitions were
relevant. Noting that the Government supports the principle of
interconnection between Northern Ireland and the UK, there was no point
in discussing the policy at the inquiry.
Mr McCulloch said: ''That does not mean that the views some of you
hold are not important. It simply means that those views are not for me.
You should put them to the appropriate forum.''
The inquiry continues today with evidence from Mr Campbell Christie,
secretary of the Scottish TUC.
Commenting on the ruling, Mr Alan Rainey, Northern Ireland
Electricity's Group Projects Manager, said he welcomed Mr McCulloch's
decision.
A spokesman for protest group, Stop The Overhead Pylons (Stop), said
last night that it felt it had suffered a serious setback as a result of
the Reporter's ruling.

Brussels
MORE than half of the British people believe membership of the EU is a
good thing, but 38% also think it does not benefit the country.
This confusion is typical of findings in the latest opinion poll
carried out by the European Commission and supports a System Three
Scotland poll in The Herald earlier this month, which suggested that
Scots are cooling on Europe.
The commission's findings suggest that exactly half of all Europeans
feel satisfied with the way democracy works in their own country (the
British figure was 53%), but less than half (45%) think democracy is
satisfactory in the EU.
Mr John Major's insistence that the feel-good factor is at work in the
UK was not reflected in the British findings.
Half of those questioned reckoned that the UK economic situation was
about the same as a year ago. Only 24% thought it improved and only 21%
thought they were better off personally in the UK.
Almost half (48%) found no change in their personal economic
circumstances and 31% reported they were worse off. More than half (52%)
believed they would not be better off in the coming year in the UK.
Despite doubts about the benefits of EU membership, most of the
British were very positive about bringing the former communist states in
eastern and central Europe into the EU.
Up to 65% wanted membership for Poland and Hungary who headed the
popularity list for probable new entrants.
Those Europeans most keen on a single currency by the end of the
century, as envisaged in Maastricht, were in the smaller EU states. An
average of 53% of all Europeans favoured the move but only 36% of
Germans and 35% of Britons wanted it.
Germans are suspicious of moves to abandon the powerful D-mark. Mr
Major negotiated an opt-out for sterling and has left it to the Commons
-- or possibly the people in a referendum -- to decide if Britain gives
up the pound for the Ecu.
A majority of Britons (53%) were in favour of monetary union, if it
means a European central bank pursuing monetary stability by fighting
inflation. European support for the idea was 70%.
But the British found themselves in mainstream European opinion on the
question of a common European foreign policy. Almost seven in 10
Europeans (69%) favour the idea, although the figures for Denmark and
Britain were (54% and 53% respectively).
There was wider support for a common defence policy with 81% of all
Europeans favouring the idea (80%) in the UK.

Audrey Gillan meets the former Rangers player who has become a
superstar chef in London, Gordon Ramsay -- a name to be reckoned with in
premier league cuisine
HIS is the name chattered by the chattering classes, the one dropped
by name droppers and his tables are the hardest to get in London. Just
27 years old and Gordon Ramsay has become the chef to watch, his
cappuccino of langoustine the dish to copy.
This week, the burly Scot who has left London's restaurant critics
salivating, discovered that his highly successful Chelsea restaurant,
Aubergine, had received the ultimate accolade, the elusive Michelin
star. To the man who won the Chef of the Year title at 25, it was
probably no surprise.
He always knew he would win something, but for Gordon Ramsay it could
quite easily have been a Cup Winners medal. For at the age of 17 he was
signed to play for Glasgow Rangers reserves. He lasted three months and
now only plays football on a Sunday with the boys from the laundry.
Sitting on a wicker sofa, among Aubergine's rag-rolled yellow hues,
Ramsay gives only a hint of regret that he never managed to test his
potential on the green grass of the Scottish Premier Division.
He says it became obvious very early that he would never make it to
the first team, and after the trial decided to pack the professional
game in. His father, a physical education teacher, was bitterly
disappointed.
''There were players there, 15, 16-years-old, good strong Irish
footballers who were brilliant. It was tough,'' he explains between sips
of very milky cappuccino. ''I got told to go to another club. They said
reserve team football for the next three years. I really didn't want to
wait and I knew I wasn't going to be the next Ally McCoist. I was to go
to Hearts and Morton -- but I decided to finish my catering course so
that I could have some form of security.''
Catering college in Banbury gave him the grounding, but young Gordon's
confidence -- tinged with a little arrogance -- took him further than he
ever imagined. The list of kitchens he has passed through reads like a
menu prestige: Albert Roux, Marco Pierre White, Guy Savoy, Joel
Robuchon, Pierre Koffmann.
While he calls himself Scottish, Ramsay left the country aged three
and a half and has a heavy, upper-middle-class English accent. Yet there
is still something there -- burly, with strawberry blond hair, you can
see him easily in a kilt rather than his whites or the leather jacket he
wears outside the kitchen.
This lack of a Scottish accent has become a joke with Aubergine's
maitre d', Jean-Claude Breton, whose thick, sweet French tones bring
words that tell Ramsay ''I don't think anyone should lose their accent,
especially a Scottish one''.
It is early on a Saturday morning and Breton is speaking between
ceaseless rings of the telephone and shining wine glasses. As he picks
up the receiver he listens as people beg for a reservation -- the
restaurant has never had an empty table since it opened in October 1993.
He sighs: ''Oh, tonight we are full madame, sorry.'' The next call is a
request for a cancellation. ''Oh, I am sorry monsieur, we are full seven
Saturdays ahead.'' The first opening for a table for two is Monday,
March 13: it is only January 21.
Ramsay himself is modest about this success. He raises his big
shoulders and says other restaurants in London are as busy as his. One
in particular is Harvey's, that of Marco Pierre White, his mentor and
the man who helped Ramsay set up with his two partners at Aubergine,
Claudio Pulze and Juliano Lotto.
Ramsay speaks of London's ''star'' chef with some affection. He
laughs: ''I saw an article on Marco and telephoned and asked for a job.
He said to me on the telephone 'I never employ a chef, I breed them'.''
Of the two years he spent there, Ramsay will say only: ''You don't
want me to go into the gory detail. I saw a lot of staff come and go. He
is probably one of the most disciplined chefs in Britain today. At the
end of the day he gives a lot. He's brought a lot more respect to the
trade and he's given a lot more credit and a lot more identity.''
But the two no longer speak after a fall-out -- even though Ramsay is
godfather to White's daughters.
''We fell out six months ago over something stupid and I haven't
spoken to him for four months. Without a doubt we will talk again,'' he
laughs, spreading his bulging forearms across the back of the sofa.
Yes, Marco gave him a ''bollocking'' but he also helped him get into
some of the hardest kitchens to work in.
After the Roux kitchens at Le Gavroche -- considered a door to
kitchens in France -- Ramsay went to work in France at Guy Savoy on the
minimum wage of #95 a week. Living in a bedsit above the Bastille, he
spent his first days as a shallot peeler. There, he overcame the
''anti-Anglais'' bias of the French chefs by having a stand-up fight.
''We just had a punch-up in the fridge and I made my mark because I was
not going to take any shit from anyone. We had a punch-up and I came out
and he stayed in and life became a bit easier,'' laughs Ramsay.
It was during the time at Guy Savoy that he won Chef of the Year in
the UK -- with a menu of a ravioli of lobster with ginger, a light
asparagus soup he had learned to make at Guy Savoy's, roast calves
sweetbreads, a classic Harvey's dish, and a vanilla creme brulee with
two chocolate sauces.
''I cooked the creme brulee for Albert at Le Gavroche and he said:
'You can't turn a creme brulee out of the mould, no-one ever turns it
out.' But I did, and I won.''
From there Ramsay took a job cooking for Reg Grundy of Grundy
Television, producer of Neighbours and Young Doctors among other
programmes.
''Everyone was throwing me these bloody deals to come back and work in
London which I didn't really want to do. I'd had a touch of the
limelight, I'd been exposed and I wanted to come back and stand on my
own feet,'' he says.
From there he was working with Joel Robuchon at Le Jamin but was
anxious to get out and do his own thing. And he hasn't stopped. Since
opening he has missed only one service when his Italian business partner
took him to the World Cup final as a treat. Otherwise, every day the
restaurant is open he is there.
''Someone had the cheek to phone up and ask 'Is Gordon cooking
tonight?' It's my restaurant, of course I'm cooking tonight,'' he
snorts.
But such is the fall-out of being the darling of the Sunday
supplements. Much of that hype came because Ramsay was producing haute
couture at off-the-peg prices. Now he can polish his first Michelin star
and charge a little bit more but there will be no compromise on the
quality.
This week the #40, six-course menu prestige is practically faultless,
its theme simplicity and quality: cappuccino of langoustine and lentils;
ravioli of lobster with a vinaigrette of crustaces; pave of brill with a
brandade of salt cod, jus Xeres; roast canon of lamb, millefeuille of
aubergine, jus of basil; creme brulee with roasted rhubarb, jus fraises;
and hot pistachio and dark chocolate souffle, sauce amer.
All of this takes endless hours and leaves very little time for
anything other than the gym, the football and Ramsay's beloved FZR
Yamaha racing bike. Explaining that keeping fit is the key, he says: ''I
have never taken drugs in my life. I don't smoke, I don't drink, I'm as
fit as a fiddle. That's what gets me through.''
Plus a dash of blind ambition. Taking one last sip of coffee, he
shrugs and says: ''My chef Guy Savoy's last words in Paris were
'Whatever you do as a chef, whether you open your own restaurant or be
some form of top consultant, make sure that you become a star in your
kitchen only.' You can't get any better then that. My real ambition
personally is to win two Michelin stars.''
He's halfway there already.

A NURSE who performed part of an appendix operation is to keep her
job, it was disclosed yesterday.
Theatre nurse, Sister Valerie Tomlinson, 53, was given a final written
warning by the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust after it investigated the
operation which took place in Treliske Hospital in Truro last December.
At a news conference later Mrs Tomlinson refused to explain why she
had acted in breach of hospital guidelines. She would only say that what
took place in the theatre was as a result of ''mutual trust and
understanding'' with the surgeon responsible for the operation, Mr Tahir
Bhatti.
She will now undergo a period of professional development and clinical
supervision of up to six months duration. If she earns a satisfactory
assessment, she will be able to return to her duties as a theatre nurse.
Mrs Tomlinson, a theatre sister for more than 17 years, from
Roseannon, near St Wenn, Cornwall, said she had worked with Mr Bhatti
for 18 months and described him as a very pleasant person and very
competent surgeon.
''I cannot say more than that, because he is a good fellow,'' she
said. Neither she nor her two Royal College of Nursing representatives
would reveal how she became involved in the operation because Mr
Bhatti's employers, South West Regional Health Authority, have yet to
consider the trust's report and decide on any appropriate action.
But RCN South West regional officer, Mr Howard Catton, said the entire
procedure had been overseen by the surgeon, who had ''supervised,
directed, instructed'' everything which had happened.
The trust's medical director, Dr Michael Voyce, said Mrs Tomlinson had
made the incision in the male patient, cut off the appendix after it was
located and prepared it for removal by Mr Bhatti. She also closed the
wound after he had carried out other procedures.
Trust chief executive, Mr Brian Milstead, said Mrs Tomlinson ''felt
confident in what she was doing'' having been in the theatre on many
occasions and seen many hundreds of such operations.
The male patient had made no official complaint, said Mr Milstead.
Mrs Tomlinson said she was relieved at the ''fair decision'' but
admitted events had been ''a bit of an ordeal''.
The trust said its investigation -- by a senior consultant surgeon and
the head of nursing -- showed Mr Bhatti had been present throughout the
operation, was responsible for it, and the safety of the patient had not
been compromised.

A QUICK draw expert's guns were hung up for good yesterday after they
were confiscated by a sheriff.
Police discovered the two Wild West revolvers after they called at the
home of Harry Fern, 42, of Spiershall Close, Yoker, in July last year on
another matter.
Yesterday he admitted unlawfully possessing the revolvers and
component parts without a firearms certificate.
Sheriff George Crozier fined him #100.
Mr Alasdair Youngson, prosecuting, said Fern told the police the guns
could only fire blanks and that he used them for quick draw competitions
and for shooting at balloons.
However, the barrels of the guns had been bored out and as such were
covered by the Firearms Act.
Mr Desmond Leslie, defending, said the guns created no danger to the
public and had been adapted so that when they fired blanks the residue
coming from their barrels was sufficient to burst balloons and other
fragile objects, in order to make gunfights more realistic.
He added that because of the case Fern had since given up entertaining
altogether.
He said: ''Over the years he used his guns at shows to generate
considerable money for charity. He had even attended functions for
Strathclyde Police and at no stage did anyone ever stop him to question
his right to hold these weapons.''
Sheriff George Crozier, who had the power to jail Fern for up to six
months or fine him up to #5000, told him: ''These are serious offences,
but in all the circumstances . . . I feel justified in moderating the
penalty.''

THE tangled love life of the murdered Oxford biologist, Dr Michael
''Spike'' Meenaghan, followed him to the grave yesterday.
Weeping and supported by friends, the married woman with whom he had
spent the last months of his life was among family mourners at St
Thomas's Cemetery, Cambusbarron, Stirling.
Mother-of-three Mrs Denise Holt, 34, from Birmingham, carried white
roses which she laid beside the grave. The card attached was signed
''Masie''.
Dr Meenaghan, 35, born and brought up in Stirling, was killed on
December 10 by a single blast in the chest from a shotgun at his home in
Oxford, where he had lived since 1990.
Police are still baffled by the killing.
Officers from Thames Valley Police were among mourners at the funeral
at the Holy Spirit Church, in St Ninians, Stirling, where Dr Meenaghan's
mother, Pat, now lives.
The service was followed by burial in Cambusbarron.
Detective Superintendent David Blair said: ''Links with Dr Meenaghan's
family and girlfriends have now been thoroughly investigated, and no
evidence has been discovered to indicate a connection between these and
his death.''
A police source confirmed that Mrs Holt's husband had been questioned
and eliminated from the inquiry.
Mrs Holt and Dr Meenaghan are understood to have met through a common
love of volleyball.
More than 20 officers are continuing to investigate the killing, but a
police source said the offer of a #10,000 reward had so far met with ''a
very poor response''.

<TEXT>
A MAN who cut a child's penis with a knife was jailed for two years
yesterday, with the sheriff warning that the public must be protected
when he gets out of jail.
A jury at Falkirk Sheriff Court had heard how truck driver James
Tulloch, 38, of Ettrick Court, Hallglen, Falkirk, used a Stanley knife
to cut the boy's penis threequarters of the way round its circumference.
Dr George Farmer, consultant paediatrician at Falkirk Royal Infirmary,
had told the two-day trial he had never seen an injury like it.
The horrific wound had been spotted by a local health visitor on a
routine visit to the boy's home in Grangemouth in autumn 1993.
Yesterday, Mr Willie Thom, defence counsel for the 6ft 3ins 17-stone
Tulloch, said: ''The reading of the charge might make some people recoil
with revulsion.''
He added that the wound was ''a very skillfully executed cut of the
skin''.
The charge said Tulloch assaulted the boy by seizing hold of him and
cutting his penis with a knife, or similar instrument, to his injury.
However, Mr Thom stressed that when doctors saw the boy four weeks
after the attack the wound had healed.
Mr Thom said reports on Tulloch showed there was no psychiatric
recommendation to be made.
When the jury convicted Tulloch, two weeks ago, Sheriff Albert Sheehan
described the assault as ''cruel and sadistic''.
Yesterday, he said reports revealed the child was seriously affected
by the attack and would need help for some time to get over it.
He jailed Tulloch for two years and gave him another 60 days for
breaching his bail conditions by not turning up on his original trial
date. The sentences are to run consecutively.
The sheriff told Tulloch he would be put under a supervision order
when he got out of jail, adding it was ''to protect the public on your
release''.

<HEADLINE>Police twice visited flat where couple and baby were lying dead</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>12</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980156642</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
POLICE said last night that they had twice visited a flat where a
18-month-old boy is thought to have died, trapped and alone after
witnessing the deaths of his parents.
However, unopened presents under the Christmas tree pointed to the
conclusion that Michael Walker would have joined his parents in death
long before police called last weekend.
Mr Tony Walker and his wife Elizabeth, in their mid-20s, were found on
Wednesday kneeling side by side in the lounge of their first-floor flat
above a hairdresser's salon in Kinmel Street, Rhyl, Clwyd, North Wales.
Their son was lying dead on the floor nearby in the same room, which
was adorned with Christmas decorations.
Police removed ''substances'' from the flat for examination. The
causes of the three deaths are expected to be disclosed when an inquest
is opened in Prestatyn today.
It is thought the parents might have died accidentally, though a
suicide pact was another possibility being investigated by police.
No-one else is being sought in connection with their deaths.
Last night North Wales Police confirmed they had visited the flat last
Friday and again on Sunday, after calls from a relative of Mr Walker
checking to find out if the family still lived there.
''No reply was received on the visits and inquiries didn't indicate
anything untoward,'' said a police spokeswoman. ''There were no
tell-tale signs like newspapers or milk on the doorstep.''
The relatives have since gone abroad. Police were yesterday still
trying to contact them about the tragedy, which was finally discovered
when Mrs Walker's mother raised the alarm and neighbours forced an
entry.
A locksmith who helped open the flat said there was a strange smell in
the hallway and the door was locked with the key inside.
Mr David Edgington, 34, a furniture store worker who lives in the flat
above, went inside and found the bodies.
''All three were in the front room. The parents were together
kneeling, their heads bowed. The baby was nearby. There was no sign of
violence,'' he said.
Police said the last confirmed sighting of the family alive and in
good health was on December 20. The unopened presents suggest the
parents died between then and Christmas Day.
Mr Walker had been a part-time postman. It is understood his employers
had written to him when he did not turn up for work a few days before
Christmas, but received no reply.
Coroner David Jones said yesterday that it ''must be a possibility''
that the child died after his parents.
A source close to the inquiry confirmed that it appeared the child may
have been the last to die, and added: ''It is very sad, the worst
scenario possible.''

THE SNP intends to turn up the heat on Labour over fuel poverty in the
run-up to the council hustings and the next General Election, starting
with a campaign this weekend.
The Nationalist leadership yesterday made clear its considers Labour's
refusal at Westminster earlier this week to back the lowering of VAT on
domestic fuel to 5% to be a vote-winner on doorsteps for the SNP.
Mrs Kay Ullrich, who speaks on social policy for the party, said: ''I
don't know how Labour MPs can face their constituents. It is an utter
disgrace. Even before VAT on fuel was introduced, fuel poverty was a
scandal in Scotland.
''For the most energy rich country in the European Union to have
levels of excess winter deaths so far above our comparable northern
European neighbours is an outrage.''
She said 27% more Scots died in harsh winter weather than in summer,
compared with 20% South of the Border, less than 15% in Sweden and
Denmark, and 10% or less in Norway and Finland.
She claimed that for 20 years Labour had refused to back special
measures on fuel poverty, culminating in this week's vote when among
Scots Labour MPs only Falkirk West's Dennis Canavan defied his Whips and
backed the SNP motion.
Mrs Ullrich challenged Labour MPs to visit social work offices in
weeks to come and listen to applicants pleading for emergency assistance
on fuel bills. ''They would think twice about the way they voted,'' she
claimed.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said the campaign starting this
weekend would focus on the achievements of SNP-controlled councils in
cushioning vulnerable people from the effects of fuel poverty.

Grozny, Thursday
RUSSIAN forces pounded rebel strongholds in Grozny with bombs,
missiles, and artillery shells today as civilians fled the shattered
Chechen capital in droves.
The Russian forces, who are trying to force separatist fighters out of
Grozny to smash Chechnya's independence drive, fired Grad missiles from
the centre and north of the city and unleashed a barrage of shells on
southern suburbs.
Locals said Russian jets bombed an oil storage facility near the
centre of Grozny.
Residents deprived of gas, electricity, and heating left the badly
damaged city in a steady stream of cars along a southern road which the
Russians have left open. Many of the cars had shattered windscreens and
were pockmarked by shrapnel.
The Russian government said its forces were meeting stubborn
resistance in Chechnya and were stepping up efforts to defeat the
rebels.
President Boris Yeltsin, who sent the troops to Chechnya more than six
weeks ago, told workers in the Lipetsk region of southern Russia that he
hoped to end the conflict soon.
''I encouraged the workers to ask questions about Chechnya and they
told me it is high time to end the conflict. I told them we wanted with
all our heart to end the conflict quickly and peacefully,'' he told
reporters.
''The military stage (of the Chechen operation) is over and now it is
the interior ministry's job,'' he said, referring to plans for interior
ministry units to take charge of the campaign.
However, there was little sign of the military taking a back seat or
of Chechen fighters giving up Grozny, the centre of which is in Russian
hands after an assault which began on December 31.
''Despite the successes of federal troops in Grozny, fighters of
illegal armed formations are continuing to put up resistance, falling
back to pre-prepared positions,'' a Russian government statement said.
An Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe delegation is
to visit Chechnya tomorrow and Saturday on a fact-finding mission.
* President Yeltsin used the ''nuclear briefcase'' which accompanies
him everywhere for the first time on Wednesday -- to chart the progress
of a suspect missile fired by Norway.
Mr Yeltsin, speaking to Interfax news agency at the start of a one-day
visit to Lipetsk, south of Moscow, said today he used the hot line to
his defence ministry.
Norway said that the missile was fired from Andoya island off North
Cape as part of a civilian research programme and went down as planned
in the Spitzbergen island region, about 620 miles from the Russian
mainland.--Reuter

Vienna, Thursday
AN AUSTRIAN defence spokesman has resigned after reports that he
suggested taking a #4m commission for the two ruling parties from a
contract for helicopters from British Aerospace, it was disclosed today.
Hermann Kraft, of the People's Party, junior partners in power with
the Social Democrats of Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, quit on Wednesday
after the magazine News said it had a tape recording of him making the
proposal in February 1994.
''I acted on my own initiative and I made a mistake. I take the
responsibility and I am drawing the consequences,'' Kraft told reporters
after announcing he he had stepped down from parliament.
The magazine today published what it said was a transcript of Kraft's
suggestion to a fellow parliamentarian to accept #4m commission for the
parties from a possible deal with British Aerospace to supply army
helicopters.
In London, a British Aerospace spokesman said the company had no
comment.
The affair sparked immediate calls from Austria's opposition Greens,
Liberals, and Freedom party for a special session of parliament to
debate the scandal.
No contract has so far been awarded to firms bidding to supply Austria
with military helicopters and a transport plane.--Reuter

THE Northern Constabulary has become the first police force in
Scotland to offer a training programme in customer care to civilian
staff in a move to improve the service it offers to the public -- law
abiding and villainous alike.
The force, which has developed the initiative in conjunction with
Inverness and Nairn Enterprise, is also the first to be allowed to award
nationally recognised qualifications in customer care.
Launching the initiative in Inverness yesterday, Chief Constable Hugh
MacMillan said: ''Everyone we come into contact with is a client. And
let me assure you I am as keen to improve relationships with our
customers who offend as I am with members of the public as a whole.
Everyone is a person and has a right to be treated properly.
''I am looking for a better presentation of customer skills, how to
deal with people when they come to the police station.''
At present, the duties of civilian support staff vary from customer
service in control rooms and reception areas of police stations, to
internal customer service in areas like training and emergency planning.
Mr McMillan said he would be encouraging all support staff to take
advantage of this initiative. The force has 280 civilian staff from
Shetland in the north to Lochaber in the south, and from the Western
Isles to Moray, and a team of ten will now pilot the programme.

Toul, Thursday
SIX teenagers were killed today when a crane toppled by a gust of wind
crashed on a school in eastern France.
The top of the yellow 30-tonne crane smashed through the roof of a
classroom in a private Christian school in the centre of the town of
Toul shortly before lessons ended.
The office of the prefect, or government representative, said the dead
students were aged between 15 and 17. The operator of the crane, which
was working on an adjoining building site, and another student were
seriously injured and five others slightly hurt.
''There was a lot of wind and the crane fell over onto the school,'' a
shopkeeper said, estimating that the crane was 80ft high. Winds were
gusting at 50mph in the town.
It was believed to be the worst accident caused by storms affecting
northern Europe. Large areas of Germany, France, and Holland were under
water tonight and forecasters said more rain and snow were on the way.
Rainfall in western France has been the heaviest for 150 years. Before
today's school accident, 10 people had been reported dead across Europe
in weather-related accidents, six of them in France. Rainfall in the
west of the country has been the heaviest for 150 years.
Police recovered three bodies from the port of Concarneau. The two men
and a woman were found in a car that was swept into the harbour. They
had been reported missing since the weekend when three more people died
in flood-related accidents in the region.
Several towns faced their sixth day of flooding. Stranded home-owners
have been unable to return to their houses. In Paris, the Seine was 13ft
above normal, blocking riverside roads and forcing the cancellation of
sight-seeing boat cruises because of dangerous currents.
A 20-year-old Swedish woman was killed in an avalanche while skiing
off piste in the Norwegian mountains.
Rivers burst their banks in several German towns and officials warned
that worse conditions may be on the way for many low-lying areas. An
81-year-old man drowned in the central town of Bad Kreuznach and in
Bavaria, rising water cut traffic and flooded streets.
''The situation is slowing becoming critical,'' said a police
spokesman in Saar, where several towns were under water.
In the low-lying Netherlands, water levels on the Rhine were rising
rapidly and shipping will have to stop on Saturday to prevent dykes
collapsing. Two villages in the district of Limburg had to be evacuated.
Rivers burst their banks in southern Belgium, flooding roads and houses.
In sharp contrast, Portuguese farmers complained cereal crops would be
damaged unless there was substantial rain in the next two weeks.
Northern Spain was hit by heavy rainstorms but lack of snow in the
Sierra Nevada looked likely to cause postponement of next week's world
skiing championships.--Reuter

From PATRICK BROGAN
Washington, Thursday
THE Republicans in Congress suffered their first serious defeat this
morning when their favourite proposal to control the federal budget was
soundly beaten.
The House of Representatives had got down to one of the key items in
the Republicans' Contract with America, the balanced-budget amendment,
and the version the party preferred came far short of the two-thirds
majority that was needed. That puts in doubt the less stringent version
that will be presented to the House later.
The Republican leadership, including Newt Gingrich, the Speaker, and
the Majority Leader, Dick Armey, wanted to amend the constitution not
only to prohibit deficits in the federal budget after 2002 but to
require a ''super-majority'' of two-thirds in both Houses before taxes
could be raised.
The same draft provided that the national debt ceiling could only be
raised by a two-thirds majority. It was universally recognised such a
change in the Constitution would make fiscal management exceedingly
difficult. For the hard-liners, that was the idea.
The proposal won 220 Republican and 33 Democratic votes -- and was
opposed by 164 Democrats, eight Republicans, and the solitary
independent in the House. Amending the constitution requires 290.
Some of the hard-liners had vowed to vote against a less restrictive
proposal that would drop the super-majority requirements for raising
taxes or the debt ceiling. When the vote comes, they will be urged to
fall into line but, even if all the Republicans unite, they will need 60
Democrats to join them. Its supporters say they have 69. We will see.
The Democrats pushed a series of amendments of their own, not with any
expectation that they would be accepted, but to embarrass the
Republicans. One would have exempted social security from future cuts,
others would protect Medicare and veterans' benefits, others, more
generally, promise to protect widows and orphans.
They will all be defeated (the one on social security went down this
morning), but the record will show the Republicans voting against, and
the Democrats will use the vote in the next election.
They are already trying out their lines: they claim that the
Republicans are hiding from the American people the secret that the
budget is to be balanced on the backs of the poor, the old, and the
weak.
Even if the simpler version of the amendment passes the House, its
fate in the Senate is not at all clear. Many moderate Republicans share
the doubts about amending the constitution.

THE new United Nations military commander in Bosnia, British
Lieutenant General Rupert Smith, took up his post today as efforts to
bring the warring factions to the negotiating table ran into
difficulties and fighting flared again in the Bihac enclave.
Efforts by international peace mediators to persuade the Bosnian Serbs
to accept the latest peace plan remained deadlocked, a senior Serb
official confirmed.
The United Nations blamed Bosnian Serb forces for shelling the
government-held town of Bihac, a UN ''safe area''. A barrage of six
shells wounded one civilian, UN spokesman Paul Risley said.
The UN said shelling by rebel Muslims and Croatian Serbs who did not
sign a Bosnia-wide truce intensified near Velika Kladusa in the north
end of the enclave today and spread west of the north-south highway for
the first time.
General Smith, 51, who replaced fellow Briton Lieutenant General Sir
Michael Rose, said that he hoped to convert Bosnia's shaky new ceasefire
into lasting peace.
''I'm pleased to take up the reins from my predecessor, Michael Rose,
to do what we can to give aid to the unfortunate and long-suffering
people caught up in this conflict and on the basis of the 'cessation of
hostilities' to work hard at arriving at a settlement and peace in this
country,'' Smith told reporters at Sarajevo airport. He said Rose's
parting words to him were: ''Good luck.''
Analysts believe Smith's main task will be to deploy UN troops between
rival Serb and Bosnian government forces to damp down fighting and
foster a revival of peace talks.
Three envoys from the five-nation ''contact group'', who are trying to
revive the peace process, were in Sarajevo today after having changed
their minds about breaking off their mission to Bosnia.
The mediators said on Wednesday they were going home because they had
failed to persuade the Serbs to accept the current peace plan as a basis
for new negotiations.
But an American official told reporters that three of the five envoys
had changed their minds and had remained in Sarajevo to consider their
next step.
In Sarajevo, the UN mounted what it feared may be its last medical
evacuation from the city, saying the programme had been crippled by lack
of funds from donor nations.
Fifteen patients boarded UN armoured vehicles at the city's main
hospital for the trip to the airport, from where they were flown out for
treatment in Denmark, the only country currently providing beds.--Reuter

SCOTTISH Liberal Democrat MPs had a stormy meeting yesterday with Mr
Roger Salmon, the director of passenger rail franchising, over the
effects of privatisation of Scottish railway services.
Afterwards they said: ''The present state of affairs is totally
unacceptable.'' Mr Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye,
accused him of ''complete and utter chicanery'' by his action in
excluding Motorail and Fort William sleepers from the Scottish
franchise, which ScotRail is expected to win in a management buy-out.
Mr Kennedy said the director had ''undermined completely the
consultation process''. It was ''a blatant breach of his remit.'' Mr
Malcolm Bruce (Gordon) said: ''We left very dissatisfied and as
concerned as ever.''
The MPs now plan to take up their concerns with the Rail Regulator, Mr
John Swift, ScotRail, and Railtrack and will also be tackling Ministers
on the issues.
The MPs also raised the future of other Scottish services, national
timetables, and the Fort William-Mallaig steam service .
Sir Russell Johnston (Inverness, Nairn, and Locahber), said, as far as
Aberdeen and Inverness sleepers were concerned, it seemed both would be
in one train, perhaps dividing at Glasgow.

GENEVA: An exiled Iraqi opposition leader said yesterday that the
entire movement was united behind a plan for a popular and military
uprising to topple President Saddam Hussein within one year. Mohammad
Baqer al-Hakim, head of the Tehran-based Supreme Council for the Islamic
Revolution in Iraq, also criticised France for supporting an easing of
the United Nations embargo on Iraq's oil exports. He urged the UN
Security Council to maintain economic sanctions imposed against Baghdad
since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Hakim declined to reveal details of the plan or military forces
willing to implement it, but said opposition to Saddam was growing in
the Iraqi army and among the people.

SCOTLAND'S longest serving civic head, the provost of the
controversial Kirkcaldy District Council, faces a fight for his
political survival after being rejected as a candidate by his party.
Provost Bob King has lost a Labour selection battle and will not be
able to stand for the party in his Glenrothes ward in April's shadow
elections for the new Fife unitary authority.
The 74-year-old former guardsman and bricklayer, who has served as the
district council's civic head since the last reform of local government
in 1975, was unavailable for comment yesterday.
He is understood to be ''greatly shocked'' by his rejection, but
Labour insiders say it was a not unexpected backlash because of the
embarrassment his authority has caused the party nationally, after
several public rows during the last three years.
These include the 1992 scandal over whether or not Ms Karen Carrick --
subsequently sacked as administration leader -- lied about her academic
qualifications, and last year's furious row after the council unfairly
sacked innocent worker Mrs Dianne Woodward, and refused to compensate
her until forced to do so by an employment appeal tribunal.
Sources believe other district councillors could be under threat as
more blood-letting is predicted because of the Woodward affair.
Mr King will remain a councillor until council reorganisation in 1996,
but unless he bids for and wins selection in another ward, the decision
means the end of a local government career which began in 1958.
He lost the nomination for the Coaltown and Woodside East ward of
Glenrothes to the second oldest member of Fife Regional Council, Mrs
Elizabeth Henderson, 80.

STRATHCLYDE'S chairman of roads and transportation, Councillor Charles
Gordon, crashed to a 7-6 defeat last night in his bid for a seat in the
new Glasgow unitary authority.
He was pipped for the Blairdardie ward by Mr Steven Purcell, 22,
secretary of Glasgow District Labour Party.
After the result was announced Mr Gordon, 42, who has been roads and
transportation chairman for just over six months, was said to be
''devastated''.
Mr Gordon has a high-profile role with Strathclyde region and has been
at the centre of the M77 controversy, although he has gained many
friends with his determination to expand and improve public transport.
However, sources within the regional council suspect he has been the
victim of the factional warfare between supporters of Glasgow Labour
leader, Councillor Pat Lally, and those of former leader, Councillor
Jean McFadden.
With McFadden supporters having significant strength within the city
Labour Party it is claimed that the success of Mr Purcell is but the
start of a wide-ranging attempt to have as many McFadden supporters as
possible elected to the new authority.
These claims have already been dismissed at the City Chambers as
''selection paranoia''.
Last night it emerged that Strathclyde's Labour leader, Councillor
Robert Gould, has joined the scramble for seats in the new Glasgow
unitary authority.
He had been expected to enjoy an easy ride in the Kingston ward --
which has a significant Asian electorate -- but it now appears that the
appearance of an Asian rival, Mr Shaukat Butt, may disrupt Mr Gould's
plans.
While indicating that he is hoping for a nomination from any one of
the 10 South Side wards, it is understood Councillor Gould is targeting
Pollokshaws, amid protests from Cathcart Constituency Labour Party that
the selection process has been ''hijacked''.
The reselection upheaval was overshadowed last night by the revelation
that Strathclyde could face cuts of #107m and a 25% increase in council
tax because of Government grant restrictions.
Thefinance committee chairman, Councillor John Mullin, said: ''We
believe we have been short-changed across the board by #115m. The level
of grant we require to keep existing services intact has been reduced
and we find ourselves in the worst possible position.
''We are having to find #107m in cuts to meet the capping limit, and
after that we are facing the prospect of having to put the council tax
up by 25%. These things are politically unpalatable to us.
''All departmental heads at Strathclyde have been asked to find 5%
cuts. Inevitably there will be cuts but no final decisions have yet been
taken about where they will fall.''
Initial suggestions include cutting direct provision and grants for
the pre-five service by 30%, freezing bursaries at 1994/95 levels,
reducing support for foreign exchange visits and closing all
free-standing community education centres.

said Colonel Gershon Hacohen had been found guilty and severely
reprimanded for an unauthorised lecture ''in which he made remarks
humiliating and hurtful to women soldiers and officers and to the honour
of women in general''. Hacohen expressed ''deep regret'' for his
comments during a recent lecture at a Jerusalem secondary school to male
and female students due to be conscripted on graduation. In the same
lecture, Hacohen said computers and answering machines could perform
many of the duties of women soldiers. Israeli women, like men, are
drafted into the army at the age of 18. Some women soldiers act as
instructors for fighting units but are banned from combat.

German shepherds guarding a car repair centre jumped a fence and
attacked her, tearing her throat, breasts, parts of her scalp, and face.
Daniela Tsankova had left home to meet her boyfriend in a bar and was 20
paces from the bar when the dogs jumped on her. Men from the bar rescued
her while she was still conscious but doctors who arrived minutes later
could not revive her. The dogs, which had been fed on raw meat and had
previously attacked people, were later shot by policemen and hunters.
Their owner disappeared fearing lynching by his neighbours.

foreign nuns missing after a rebel raid on the northern town of Kambia.
The defence ministry said they had had turned up safe but the Catholic
mission said it could not confirm the report. A ministry spokesman
confirmed the nuns -- six Italians and a Brazilian -- had been kidnapped
on Wednesday but said they were now back at Kambia's polio hospital,
which was in the hands of government troops. There was still no word of
seven other foreigners kidnapped in two rebel attacks on mines in the
south-east last week, but rebels holding two British aid workers, one a
Scot, in the north have said they could be freed soon.

A PENSIONER who strangled his alcoholic wife after ''going through
hell'' in the last decade of their 47-year marriage was allowed to walk
free from the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday.
Judge Lord Milligan put 74-year-old David McLeish on probation for
three years.
The judge said it was a very rare case where a killing had been
committed with apparent ''sustained deliberation'' but in which a jail
sentence did not have to be imposed. He added that the major mitigating
factor in the crime was McLeish's mental state at the time of the
killing.
The judge heard earlier that McLeish, a retired newsagent, was
suffering from the onset of either dementia or Alzheimer's disease when
he strangled his wife, Dorothy, 72, in their flat on Glasgow's Paisley
Road West on September 7 last year.
McLeish was originally charged with murder, but the Crown accepted his
plea to the reduced charge of culpable homicide after accepting that the
balance of his mind was disturbed.
The court was told that Mrs McLeish had been an alcoholic ever since
her husband retired 11 years ago. She had been abusive and very
difficult throughout that period.
On the day she was killed Mrs McLeish had been drinking and had
ordered her husband out of their two-bedroom flat. He went into a
bedroom to avoid her, but she followed him. There he grabbed her by the
throat and told her: ''I am going to murder you.''
Mrs McLeish returned to her chair in the living room, but soon after
Mr McLeish came into the room with a length of cord and strangled her.
He then phoned the police and confessed.
McLeish had admitted culpable homicide when he appeared earlier at the
High Court in Glasgow.

CIVIL servants will be protected from political pressure under a code
of ethics proposed by the Government. It will include the right to
independent appeal in cases where civil servants feel they have been
asked to act unethically.
Civil Service Minister David Hunt said the aim was to reinforce the
traditional impartiality of the Civil Service, which faces sweeping
changes under reforms aimed at exposing its procedures to market
competition.
The Command Paper published yesterday consolidates responses received
to last summer's White Paper on the Civil Service and the report
published in the autumn by the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Select
Committee.
Its publication coincides with growing pressure on the Government to
reform the procedures governing the behaviour of Ministers, following
the disclosure that the former Energy Secretary Lord Wakeham is taking a
post with a merchant bank that advised on electricity privatisation.
Under the 13-point code, which goes out for consultation, civil
servants will not be able to benefit from their experience.
They ''should not make use of their official position or information
acquired in the course of their official duties to further their private
interests or those of others.''
Mr Kevin McNamara, Shadow Minister for the Civil Service, said Labour
welcomed the decision to introduce the new code but warned it ''may have
to be re-examined after the report of the Nolan committee and the Scott
inquiry''.
The Liberal Democrats welcomed the document. Spokesman. Caithness and
Sutherland MP Robert MacLennan said: ''The Government's acceptance of
the need to protect civil servants from unreasonable demands by its own
Ministers is a welcome reversal of policy.''
The Government proposes to enhance the role of the Civil Service
Commissioners as part of its efforts to encourage promotion on merit.
Despite reaffirming its commitment to a ''predominantly'' career Civil
Service, the Government also confirmed its intention to put all senior
civil servants on contracts.

From ARTHUR SPIEGELMAN
Los Angeles, Thursday
PROSECUTORS today accused defence lawyers of trying to use heroin
addicts, thieves, felons, and ''a court-certified pathological liar'' as
witnesses to save O J Simpson as the so-called murder trial of the
century was thrown into disarray.
With the chief strategist of the prosecution team in a hospital with
chest pains and a legal dispute raging between lawyers on both sides,
Judge Lance Ito postponed the trial until Monday.
Prosecutors had asked for a 30-day delay to investigate more than a
dozen witnesses the defence team sprang on them. The prosecution claimed
the defence had pulled an ethically questionable move by not revealing
their witnesses until lead Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran made his
opening statement.
Cochran told of people who could testify they saw white and Hispanic
men running from the scene of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Ronald Goldman or heard sounds of an altercation.
Deputy District Attoney Christopher Darden angrily told the court that
had the prosecution known of the new witnesses ''we could have informed
counsel that some of these people are heroin addicts, thieves and
felons''. He added: ''One material witness is the only person I've heard
known to be a court-certified pathological liar.''
Cochran replied: ''They cannot shut me up, your honour. I am going to
tell the truth, things I knew but had no obligation to disclose to them.
There is no misconduct in this case your honour. They just can't stand
the truth. They are constantly trying to shackle me. They want to to get
into our briefcases. They would go home with us if they could.''
A weary Judge Ito said: ''This is going to be a long case.''
Deputy District Attrorney William Hodgman was so outraged yesterday
that he angrily lectured the defence on its ethics after making a series
of objections during Cochran's opening. ''I don't think in the history
of jurisprudence have we ever had anything occurring like what has
happened in this courtroom,'' he said.
By early evening, Hodgman had pains in his chest and was admitted to a
hospital. The case could be delayed until he is well enough to return.
While expressing sympathy for Hodgman, Cochran demanded a chance to
finish his opening statement which left off with him accusing the Los
Angeles police laboratory of being a ''cesspool of contamination''.
He had drawn a portrait of an incompetent police force that sloshed
through the victim's blood, wiped or tossed away evidence, lost a sample
of Simpson's blood, possibly manufactured evidence against him, and
ignored witnesses whom he said could have cleared Simpson.
He used the word ''sinister'' to describe some of their actions and
accused the prosecution of trying to win at any cost.
Cochran told Ito today he wanted to finish his statement, saying of
the prosecution: ''They have the temerity and unmitigated gall to come
in here and say they have been sabotaged.''
But Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark denied his charges and said
the prosecution might seek to reopen its opening statement to counter
the defence.
Hodgman, the man charged with putting together the pieces of the
puzzle in the killings became visibly angry when Cochran talked about
new evidence that would clear Simpson. Cochran's address to the jury had
Hodgman jumping up and down like a yo-yo to register objections.
Most of the objections were overruled by the judge, allowing Cochran
to talk of witnesses who walked by Nicole Simpson's townhouse without
noticing anything unusual at 10.25pm on the night of the murders when
the prosecution put the time of the killings 10 minutes earlier.
Cochran also argued that the violence of the crime, with the victims
receiving more than 60 stab wounds, should have left the murderer
''saturated in blood''. But there was a minimal amount of blood found in
Simpson's white Ford Bronco and in his home, which could be innocently
explained, Cochran said.--Reuter

Lacroix whipped up sensational gala gowns with wasp waist corsets and

THE Prime Minister has rejected demands for an inquiry into the
Lockerbie disaster, in advance of a debate in the Commons next week on
the bombing demanded by Linlithgow MP Tam Dayell.
In a letter to Mr Dalyell, Mr Major said the idea of an inquiry had
been examined in the year following the December 1988 attack, in which a
bomb destroyed a PanAm jet over Lockerbie, killing 270 people.
He said: ''I recognise that the relatives would like to see a further
inquiry but . . . I cannot agree that a further inquiry should be held.
However I can assure you, as we have assured the relatives, that the
Government remains committed to obtaining justice for all the victims of
this terrible crime.''
The Government maintains that the attack was the work of Libyan
intelligence. Arrest warrants for two Libyan suspects were issued by
Scottish and American prosecutors.
However, a steady stream of evidence produced by campaigners has cast
doubts on the Government's case against Libya. The debate was rekindled
last week with the publication of a document obtained from American
intelligence files suggesting the American Government knew that the
bombing was ordered by Iranian extremists.
In a written answer to Mr Dalyell this week, Mr Major said the latest
allegations ''were examined at the time by the competent authorities
together with a great deal of other often contradictory material, but no
evidence has been found to substantiate them.''

DISILLUSIONED actors from the supporting cast of The Big Picnic, Bill
Bryden's epic First World War drama, yesterday attacked the play's
production company for failing to settle its wages bill.
While the principal cast were paid in full, many of the actors who
supported them are still waiting for final payment of at least one
week's wages. Members of the technical staff are also said to be owed
money.
The supporting cast, mostly young actors who have not yet gained their
Equity cards, claim they have been pursuing the Glasgow-based Promenade
Productions for payment ever since the curtain fell on the play in
October last year.
This week they finally received a response. In a letter to all of the
cast members, producer Nicholas Newton admitted the investment in The
Big Picnic -- and in the former Harland and Wolff shed where the play
was shown -- had led to ''a temporary shortfall of funds''.
However, he was prepared to offer them a partial settlement of ''40p
or 50p to the #1'' which he hoped to be able to pay out by the end of
this month; but he will only give them the money if they sign a letter
agreeing to take no action against the company.
Mr Newton claimed the company was in the process of securing a new
financial package from four major funding bodies, including Glasgow
District Council. He also hoped to receive further funding from the
European Regional Development Fund and from the Scottish Arts Council's
Lottery cash.
If these were successful, then he would pay the cast the balance they
were owed.
One cast member, Mr Stephen King, said: ''Basically, what they're
saying is if we sign this letter and don't sue them then they'll give us
40% or 50% of what they owe us. As far as I'm concerned Promenade
Productions have taken advantage of the cast. They know that they are
people who are starting out in their careers and will not want to rock
the boat.
''I think the wage bill outstanding comes to only about #3000 or
#4000. I don't understand why they can't pay it when you consider that
the budget for the production was #1m. They've let us down. I would
discourage any other young person starting out in their career from
participating with the company in any future productions.''
Another cast member, Mr Tim Reid, said: ''The Big Picnic provided us
with great experience but the problems really started after the show
finished and we didn't receive our last week's wages. We've been ringing
up Promenade and getting the run around ever since.
''I feel that the good experience I had of doing The Big Picnic has
been spoiled by what happened at the end. In the supporting cast alone
there were between eight and eleven of us and, as far as I know, none of
us has been paid.''
A third actor, who wished to remain nameless, said he had ''worked his
butt off'' for #85-a-week and his last but one pay cheque had bounced at
the bank. He was still waiting for his final week's wages.
Last night Mr Jimmy Logan, one of the principal members, said:
''Whatever happens people have to get their wages. I can't believe that
these people have not been paid. They were hardly earning a wage. I've
been an employer in the theatre for 40 years and my only claim to fame
is that, if someone was engaged on a wage, they always got paid.''
Mr Logan said he had no personal cause to complain because, although
there was ''a certain amount of delay'' he had been paid in full.
Equity's senior official in Scotland, Mr Drew McFarlane, said he was
aware Promenade Productions had been ''in a state of flux'' with their
financing. A number of his members had had monies outstanding to them
during the production run.
''We had a dispute with the company over overtime payments and a
number of cheques bounced in the last week of the production,'' he said.
However, as is the normal practice with theatrical productions, the
Equity members were covered by a #22,600 guarantee bond, the finance for
which was provided by Strathclyde Region.
Mr McFarlane said: ''When we found that actors were telephoning us
saying that they had lodged their cheque and it had bounced, we made
sure that everyone was reimbursed.''
On the supporting cast's situation, he said: ''I find that a dead
liberty because these guys were getting paid next to nothing. A lot of
them were students from the drama school.''
Contacted last night, Mr Newton commented: ''It is not our intention
to deprive them of the amounts outstanding to them. But all creditors
have got to be treated as equals. We are endeavouring to finance the
company and we will endeavour as soon as that support is forthcoming to
make payment in full. There is no way we can single anyone out for
special treatment.''
Glasgow district, which has already approved grants of #105,000 to go
towards the company's #558,000 plan to convert the Harland and Wolff
shed in Govan into a permanent theatre complex, confirmed yesterday it
was trying to help Promenade in any way it could.

MPs NEAR the Commons touchline barrier watched nervously as the
Speaker yesterday blew her whistle on Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour
MP for Workington.
Mr Eric Cantona had just demonstrated the dangers of being too close
to a player on his way to the dressing room, especially if you have just
been barracking him loudly.
Perhaps Tory back benchers have not yet approached the quality of
invective deployed by Crystal Palace fans. Mr Campbell-Savours went
quietly.
In fact, although Miss Boothroyd had shown him the yellow card, he
took himself off before she could produce the red.
The player, Mr Campbell-Savours, was kicking at Lord Jeffrey Archer,
who he claimed, behind the shelter not of a wall but parliamentary
privilege, had been guilty of criminal activity over dealings in Anglia
Television shares.
This was the parliamentary equivalent of a sliding tackle with the
ball someway distant from the man you are scything down.
The rules of the Westminster Game are that you don't make such
allegations against fellow members of either House except by way of a
formal motion.
Worse, Mr Campbell-Savours, a cadaverous person in whom persistence
and righteousness are mixed in a formidable cocktail, had said that ''we
all know,'' implicating the entire House in his charge.
The Speaker told Mr Campbell-Savours he could either get his question
to order or be sent off. While he thought about this, the Tories gave a
passable imitation of those occasions on which team-mates of the fouled
man converge on the offender and the ref has to physically separate
them.
However, Miss Boothroyd is more than a match for her charges and, in
any event, Mr Campbell-Savours said: ''I always defer to you.'' Not a
remark which any sportswriter has ever reported being offered by Mr
Cantona to a match official.
Mr Campbell-Savours added: ''I believe it is criminal activity and I
will leave'' and headed for the exit. Though a man of many abilities,
his repertoire does not include flying tackles. Just in case, though,
the Tory back benchers nearest the touchline quietened down.
Fans rarely think of the stress such exchanges impose on the referee.
Mr John Butcher (Coventry South West -- Con.), who followed up with what
looked from the press box a hard but fair tackle on media magnates whose
objectivity does not prevent them funding Mr Tony Blair -- was stopped
in mid stride by a loud blast on the whistle.
He was asked to rephrase his charge as well. Despite brisk barracking
from the Red terraces Mr Butcher kept his cool, rephrased his question,
made his point and stayed on the pitch.
In the middle of all this Mr Denis McShane (Rotherham -- Lab.) offered
Mr Major a framed wise saying of Gandhi. As the saying was ''there is
enough in the world for everybody's need but not enough for everybody's
greed'' this was equivalent to one of those handshakes often offered to
a man you have just hacked down from behind.
Mr Major spurned the offer, though mildly. Offering a wise saying of
Gandhi to Mr Cantona would, one imagines, be a lot more dangerous.

THE fate of two Scots Guards, accused of murdering a teenager in
Belfast, is set to fuel the intense public debate over the Army's rules
of engagement in Northern Ireland.
Guardsman Mark Wright, from Angus, and his colleague, James Fisher,
have been held in military custody for seven months awaiting judgment.
Their two-week trial was adjourned after final legal submissions were
made in June last year.
A spokesman for the Northern Ireland department of public prosecutions
yesterday confirmed that, while no date had been set, the judge's
findings were expected to be announced soon.
Lord Justice Kelly told Belfast Crown Court on June 27 that he was
reserving judgment in the case, and has since delayed announcing
verdicts until the outcome of an appeal by paratrooper Lee Clegg to the
House of Lords.
Earlier this month, five Law Lords ruled that Private Clegg's
conviction for killing the passenger of a Belfast joyrider should stand.
They said a soldier in Northern Ireland had ''no scope for graduated
force'', but expressed concerns about definitions of murder and the
mandatory life sentence.
That decision has prompted a huge public campaign to release Clegg,
and there will be considerable attention paid to the verdicts handed
down to Guardsmen Wright and Fisher.
The Prime Minister and senior Ministers discussed the case of Clegg at
a Cabinet meeting yesterday. Mr Major is known to be taking a close
personal interest in the matter.
It was also announced the House of Commons will debate the rules of
engagement for security forces in Northern Ireland next Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuinness, on a three-day visit to
Britain, added further controversy by claiming that Clegg had
''summarily executed'' his victim, Ms Karen Reilly, 18.
He said: ''Hundreds of Irish civilians have been murdered by the
British Army. Very few British soldiers have been charged or convicted
for those offences.''
Sinn Fein's spokesman on prison issues, Mr Pat McGeown, said Clegg's
treatment strengthened the argument for the transfer of republican
prisoners to jails in Northern Ireland from English prisons.
''Right at the start, Private Clegg had no problem at all being
transferred back to England to be nearer his family.
''There are Irish prisoners who have been in prison in England for 20
years and want to be transferred back to be near their families and the
British have point-blank denied them that access.''
Guardsmen Wright, 21, and Fisher, 28, are charged with the murder of
Peter McBride, 18, from North Belfast, who was shot twice in the back in
September 1992, as he fled from a four-strong Army patrol which had been
questioning him.
They told the court they believed Mr McBride had been carrying a
coffee-jar bomb under his jacket, and fired at him only because they
believed their lives were in danger.
In his evidence, Guardsman Wright said Mr McBride had been acting
suspiciously while being questioned, and claimed the teenager ran off
after pulling out another officer's radio ear-piece.
He gave chase, shouting a warning to the teenager, and then heard a
round being fired. He assumed that Mr McBride had shot at him, and fired
twice at him.
Guardsman Wright said that, almost simultaneously, he heard another
two shots, and saw Guardsman Fisher standing with his rifle at his
shoulder. Mr McBride then seemed to crumple to the ground.
However, Crown counsel alleged that their stories had been concocted
after the shooting incident and argued that, while it could not be
determined who fired the fatal shot at Mr McBride, it was irrelevant
since the four members of the patrol were acting in concert.

A HOSPITAL trust yesterday expressed regret that it took more than six
hours to find a bed for a 76-year-old stroke victim.
Mrs Alma Mills, who lives in sheltered housing in East Kilbride, was
found lying beside her bed by a home help at 9.30am on Tuesday. But when
her doctor phoned Hairmyres Hospital she was told there was no bed
available.
Her family contacted local councillors and MP Adam Ingram, who phoned
the hospital throughout the afternoon. But it was 4.45pm before Mrs
Mills was admitted.
Her daughter, Mrs Isabel Keenan, said: ''We were told there was no bed
available in the whole of Lanarkshire, and that we would just have to
wait until they got in touch.
''I didn't think that was the way someone should be treated. My mother
is one of the generation who brought in the National Health Service. Yet
the first time she needs hospitalised, they can't do it.''
Mrs Mills has had a scan and physiotherapy, and was doing well since
she was admitted, said Mrs Keenan.
''I have nothing but praise for the doctors and nurses -- it is the
bureaucracy you have to get through to get to them that makes me
angry.''
Mr Douglas McKenzie, the Hairmyres and Stonehouse Trust's
administrative and support services manager, said efforts had been made
through the day to find a bed, both within Hairmyres and other hospitals
in the area, and they had been ''well on the way'' to a solution by the
time they were contacted by Mr Ingram and the councillors.
''Hospitals across the country may have similar problems from time to
time and look for similar solutions in dealing with increased winter
demand from an ageing population,'' he said.
''Such demand has increased significantly in recent years. It is
regretted that a bed was not immediately available and we are concerned
it took some hours to provide one. Our aim is to minimise the risk of
such problems.''

SNEAK thief Brian Carbin couldn't resist the opportunity when he saw
an open door in a corridor at Glasgow High Court.
Carbin, 27, who was a witness in a trial, walked in and took a cheque
book and a wallet containing credit cards from an overcoat pocket.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday it was revealed that the property
belonged to High Court judge Lord Morton of Shuna. The room was the
judge's official retiring room.
Defending Carbin, solicitor advocate Mr Desmond Finnieston said that
following his arrest Carbin had written to Lord Morton offering his
apologies.
Carbin, of Torogay Street, Milton, Glasgow, admitted breaking into
Lord Morton's room at the High Court Building in Ingram Street, Glasgow,
on September 8.
The charge revealed that apart from stealing his credit cards and
cheque book Carbin also took Lord Morton's ID cards for the House of
Lords and the Court of Session, and his Court of Session key.
Sentencing him to a total of three months for the theft and a bail
offence, Sheriff George Crozier described Carbin's crime as
''audacious''.

A CLAIM by the SNP leader, Mr Alex Salmond, yesterday that the Scots
are ''political prisoners'' set off a furious row, with MPs from the
other three Scottish parties attacking the description, which he used in
a speech to foreign journalists.
Mr Salmond told the Foreign Press Association: ''We are effectively
political prisoners within an incorporating Union which is seriously
damaging to Scotland.''
He added: ''It has become a political arrangement which had made
Scotland poorer, sicker, less democratic, more dangerous, and
politically unstable.''
Mr James Wallace, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said: ''This
was hype gone far wrong. He seriously demeans those who are genuinely
suffering imprisonment for their political beliefs. We are not an
occupied country.
''People do have a chance to register their votes at the ballot box
and the majority have consistently voted against independence.''
Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, said: ''Mr Salmond
is prisoner of his own delusions. The people of Scotland want a new
government not a new state''
Mr Raymond Robertson, the Conservative MP for Aberdeen South, said:
''It's not Scotland that is politically unstable. Alex Salmond himself
becomes more unstable every day. Most Scots will be repulsed by his
talks of political prisoners because he isn't describing the Scotland
they are living in or recognise.''
In his speech, Mr Salmond attacked the union as ''an eighteenth
century political structure built as preparation for Empire''.
He argued the time for the union with England, Wales, and Northern
Ireland was past, adding: ''The agenda of the twenty-first century is
the sophisticated pooling of sovereignty in the new Europe, not
submergence of Scotland within an early eighteenth-century political
arrangment.
He said: ''Critics of the SNP say that we simply wish to exchange one
union for another. But the British union is of the old-fashioned,
imperialist kind.
''The European Union, by contrast, is of the modernising and
liberating variety.''
He added that Labour's devolution plans would result in constant
disputes between Edinburgh and Westminster over areas such as VAT on
fuel and nuclear weapons.
* British voters support a tax raising Scottish Parliament and a Welsh
assembly but reject the idea of regional assemblies for England,
according to a Mori poll in The Times today.
A Scottish Parliament is approved by 43% with 27% against. In Scotland
the figure rises to 72% for with only 18% against. Among English voters
39% approved the parliament and 28% rejected it.
A Welsh assembly is approved by 38% with 30% against; among Welsh
voters 59% voted yes and 22% no. Support in England was a narrower 35%
in favour to 32% against.
But powers for regional assemblies in England were opposed by 40% with
only 32% in support. In England 41% rejected the idea with 33%
supporting it. An exception was in the northern region where an assembly
was backed by 39% to 32%.

THE Prime Minister yesterday began his preparations for the crucial
European Union conference next year on political and monetary
integration. A two-hour Cabinet meeting agreed how to set about the
negotiations in the light of Tory divisions.
Mr Major won agreement for a large special Cabinet Committee which is
slightly weighted in favour of the moderates.
The Prime Minister is demanding secrecy covering its preparations. He
wants to prevent leaks to the Tory dissidents and to keep confidential
his negotiating hand with the 14 other EU Member States confidential.
The Cabinet set the parameters for the preparations for the 1996
Inter-Governmental Conference, at which he has already pledged, Mr Major
will veto any proposals for further integration that might affect
British sovereign powers.
The Cabinet agreed that the guidelines for these negotiations are set
by Mr Major's speech at Leiden University last September. In this
lecture, Mr Major identified the issues:
* A fairer voting system.
* Simpler and more democratic legislative procedures.
* Government heads' control over the EU Commission.
* More rigorous prosecution by the Commission of EU budget fraud.
* A reduction of Commission bureaucracy, starting with the number of
EU Commissioners in Brussels.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd will chair this special Cabinet
Committee over the next year.

THE university lecturer accused of poisoning bottles of tonic water at
a Safeway store broke down as he told police he would ''kill the
blighter'' responsible.
A jury at the High Court in Edinburgh heard Dr Paul Agutter protest
his innocence in an occasionally emotional taped interview with police
after he was detained for questioning on the Safeway poisoning and of
trying to murder his wife, Alex, 39.
Dr Agutter, 48, said that, although he planned to leave his wife for a
former student who was the new woman in his life, he was still extremely
fond of her and held her in the highest respect.
Dr Agutter, of Kilduff Lodge, Athelstaneford, East Lothian, denies
attempting to murder his wife at their home on August 28 last year by
putting atropine in a glass of gin and tonic.
He also denies endangering the lives of eight people who bought tonic
water from Safeway's store at Swanston in Edinburgh on August 24 after
he had allegedly placed contaminated bottles on the shelves.
Detective Chief Inspector Brian Doneghan told the court that Dr
Agutter had been detained and taken to Haddington Police Station on
September 5 where had given a taped interview after being cautioned.
On the tape, Dr Agutter explained that he and Alex had gradually
drifted apart and that the fault was more on his side than hers.
Asked what his feelings were towards his wife, Dr Agutter replied that
sometimes he could see her far enough and ''sometimes she had me tearing
my hair''.
He added, however: ''I have a great respect for her and a great deal
of liking for her. She is a very honest, straightforward, hard-working
person. She's highly intelligent, highly articulate, and well organised.
She has an enormous amount of good qualities. I regard her very
highly.''
He said that, in the long term, he wanted a formal separation and
possibly a divorce, so that he could marry Ms Carole Bonsall, the mature
student with whom he had began a relationship in 1993. They met when she
was on a degree course. His wife knew about Ms Bonsall but for the most
part they still got on all right.
Asked if he had ever used atropine in his work as a biochemist at
Napier University in Edinburgh, he said he had once used it in an
experiment three years ago, but would certainly not keep it in his
house.
He was then asked: ''What do you think of the person that's
responsible for putting atropine into bottles of tonic water?''
He replied that he found it a difficult question to answer then added:
''Oh good heavens, of course you think, you are quite convinced that
I've done it so I ought to to be able to answer this.
''I'm sorry but I do not understand the motive. I can't understand why
a random thing like this should be done. It's such a bizarre substance
to choose.''
He agreed that it would have to be someone with knowledge of atropine,
which he had looked up, once he discovered what had been used to
contaminate the tonic water.
His researches had disclosed that it had a bitter taste which would be
detected in almost anything. However, tonic water, which contained
quinine, would disguise the flavour.
''It may have been a lucky chance that they picked on tonic water to
put it in, but it strikes me that it is an extraordinary coincidence and
that whoever did it must have known that the flavour was bitter.''
It was put to him that, when he had been asked what he thought of the
person responsible, he hadn't condemned or criticised them. Dr Agutter
replied: ''To tell the truth if I got hold of the blighter I would kill
him on the spot.''
At this point he broke down and detectives gave him a chance to
compose himself. He said: ''Gentlemen, I apologise for having been
somewhat overcome.''
He was then asked about a trip he had made the previous Wednesday to
Safeway's at Swanston where he bought two bottles of tonic water. The
shelves at the tonic section had been rather full and two botttles had
fallen on the floor. He placed them back on the shelf.
The trial continues.

FEARS were growing last night for the safety of two young children
after they were abducted from council care by their parents, who face a
child cruelty charge.
A local authority care worker was slightly injured when Mr Kevin
Morris, 23, and Ms Jenny Page, 21, snatched the children, aged
two-and-a-half and 10 months, from a house in Walford Drive, Lincoln, on
Monday.
They drove off in a white Ford Escort -- NRP 856Y.
Detective Chief Inspector Nick Howard said Ms Page and Mr Morris were
on bail for a charge of alleged cruelty relating to one of the children.
''As time passes we are becoming progressively more concerned for the
welfare of the two children, who were due to be lawfully fostered as a
result of a recent High Court decision,'' he added.
Police said they had no indication the couple and the children had
left the country, but issued an ''all ports warning''.
Mr Howard, leading the inquiry, said he believed the adults may have
tried to alter their appearance.
Ms Page may have cut short her blonde hair and dyed it black, and Mr
Morris is thought to have cut his hair into a crewcut style.
He believed they were still in possession of the Escort and appealed
for anyone who may have seen the car or the group to contact the police.
Mr Howard added: ''We would ask petrol attendants, supermarket staff
or anybody who may have rented out property recently to be extra
vigilant.
''These are two young children who may at some stage require medical
treatment.''

By Our Political Staff
THE Government last night beat off a Labour attack on Social Security
Secretary Peter Lilley's plans to alter help to mortgage payers, with a
Commons majority of 35.
Voting was 277 to 242 to reject an Opposition motion protesting that
withdrawal of interest payments assistance during the first nine months
on income support for those obtaining a mortgage after October 1 and
cuts for existing borrowers would increase repossessions and further
depress the housing market.
However, Ministers faced fierce criticism during the debate from Tory
Nichlas Winterton (Macclesfield), who abstained in the vote.
Earlier, the Prime Minister clashed angrily at Question time with
Labour leader Tony Blair.
Mr Blair challenged Mr Major over Mr Lilley's claim that junior
Ministers were underpaid and protested that the Government was proposing
at the same time to reduce mortgage help for the unemployed.
The Prime Minister retorted: ''The drop in mortgages from their peak
as a result of the economic polices we've followed, since interest rates
have been falling, is #140 a month.''
Later Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar, opening the
debate, said new mortgage holders would be in ''a help-free zone for a
period of nine months''.
Existing ones would be hit as they would get no help for two months
and then only 50% paid for the following four.
The Government's action would mean insurance premiums adding between
#200 and #300 to the annual home ownership costs.
However, Mr Lilley told the House two-thirds of home-owners did not
qualify for income support on mortgage interest because they had a
working spouse or savings. Many of the remainder would be disqualified
because they would receive redundancy pay or an early retirement
package.
He said: ''The very existence of income support for mortgage interest
has undermined the growth of private insurance over the period where it
could provide a valuable cover.
Mr Winterton said the Government's move was ''yet another nail in the
coffin of the housing market and the property-owning democracy.''
The plans amounted to a ''betrayal of those on low incomes, the
self-employed, those on short term contracts and of others now who are
struggling to buy a stake in the property- owning democracy''.

A JOINT venture between Prestwick-based aeroplane makers Jetstream and
the Franco-Italian combine ATR could cost up to 180 jobs but will secure
manufacturing at the Ayrshire plant.
Senior management of the British Aerospace subsidiary yesterday
confirmed a series of disclosures in The Herald when it announced the
deal with ATR to build and sell the world's most complete range of
regional aircraft.
Mr Allan MacDonald, Jetstream's managing director, said: ''This is a
great day for Prestwick. We have secured a deal which means security for
the large majority of the workforce and prepares this company for the
next century.''
Among the casualties of the joint venture will be around two-thirds of
those involved in sales, marketing, and support services, with the
remainder being relocated to a new headquarters in Toulouse, France.
The Jetstream 61, based on the controversial Advanced Turbo Prop
aircraft and the subject of a costly revamp last year, will be phased
out over 12 months.
Fine details of the deal are still to be worked out and talks with the
trade unions will begin at once, but it appears that a net loss of more
than 400 jobs will be suffered at the British Aerospace sites at
Prestwick and Woodford, near Manchester.
A name for the new company has still to be decided, but because of its
similarities with the European Airbus project. it is already being
dubbed Mini Airbus and Eurotaxi.
What is for sure is that, with the successful 30-seat Jetstream 41 and
Avro regional jets being added to the ATR 42 and 72 aeroplanes, the new
consortium will be able to offer the widest range of regional aircraft
in the world.
Mr MacDonald said: ''It has been clear for some time that there are
too many companies in the market chasing too few customers. Despite the
Jetstream 41 proving itself to be world class it was clear that for this
company to prosper we needed to work with partners.
''This is the best deal for all the partners are ensures that we can
compete successfully and be prepared for the expected upturn in the
world aviation market.''
Despite the loss of J61 in the coming year, Mr MacDonald and his team
are confident that the slack will be taken up by the growing J41 order
book, and by increases in aero-structures work, for British Aerospace
products and other manufacturers.
Mr Mike O'Callaghan, the director and general manager at Prestwick,
said: ''We have a fine workforce and the best production line in the
business. We can go on to increase our share of the world markets.''
The executive team has given an assurance that existing customers of
the ATP, of which British Airways is the largest with 14 which they
operate mainly in Scotland, will continue to be given every support
despite the production rundown.
A BA spokeswoman said: ''We wish Jetstream every success in their
joint venture. We have had an excellent working relationship with them
in the past and we look forward to working with them in the future.''
There was a mixed response from local MPs of whom Mr Phil Gallie,
Conservative MP for Ayr, gave the strongest welcome. He said: ''This
joint venture ensures a bright future for Prestwick and the management
team is to be congratulated on securing such a good deal for the local
workforce.
''As far as the Jetstream 61 is concerned, Prestwick inherited a duff
aeroplane and turned it in to a good one, but the market has not
responded quickly enough.
''Any job loss is regretted, but I am confident that the calibre of
people affected will not be slow in finding another place in the jobs
market.''
Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley,
said: ''My reaction is one of delight at the securing of manufacturing
jobs, tinged with sadness that employment will be cut back.
''We must ensure that everything possible is done in the coming months
to ensure that the blow to these people is softened as much as it can
be.
''I have been most impressed with the openness and honesty of the
Jetstream management throughout the negotiation period, which is in
stark contrast to the behaviour of Rolls-Royce bosses over job losses at
East Kilbride recently.''
Mr Brian Donohoe, the MP for Cunninghame South, said: ''I cautiously
welcome today's announcement, which, given the current state of the
international civil aircraft market, makes a good deal of commercial
sense.
''Instead of having three European companies competing against each
other, as well as against other producers, the new consortium should be
able to rely on a more stable order book and reduced costs. This should
underpin the safety of almost 2000 jobs at the plant.''
Executives of Aerospatiale of France and Italian partner Alenia both
welcomed the new joint venture with ''one of our traditional industrial
friends''.

A FIREARMS expert yesterday told the inquest into the deaths of 23
Britons that a ''veritable arsenal'' of weapons and explosives was
amassed at the Branch Davidian ranch near Waco, Texas, before the 51-day
siege and inferno.
In the ashes of the Mount Carmel compound, occupied by cult leader
David Koresh and his followers, the FBI found 355 firearms, including
automatic and armour-piercing weapons, grenades, grenade launchers,
explosives, and combat equipment.
On the fourth day of the hearing in Manchester, Mr Thomas Warlow, Home
Office firearms adviser, said there were also 2,000,000 rounds of
ammunition, much of which exploded in the fire, leaving massive amounts
of bullets and shrapnel in the bodies of some of the victims.
Many of the firearms had been converted from semi-automatic to fully
automatic weapons normally only used by the military, he added. Some
were capable of firing 600 rounds a minute, or 10 rounds a second.
The arsenal included 122 self-loading pistols, more than 60 Armalite
and Kalashnikov-type automatic weapons, other self-loading and
pump-action rifles and carbines, a British Sten gun, and two 50
millimetre heavy assault rifles capable of piercing armour.
''There was also an enormous amount of components and material that
could be used for firearm assembly,'' said Mr Warlow.
''There were curious pieces of tactical equipment that could be used
by Swat teams in the US or tactical aid teams in the UK.''
He said this included ballistic body armour, helmets, gas masks,
goggles, knee and elbow pads, and bullet-proof vests.
In view of the amount of weapons, said Mr Warlow, ''to some degree we
can understand the means the federal agents chose to use in their final
assault''.
He said the large amounts of shrapnel and other material in the
victims resulted from them having been on top of the piles of ammunition
when the heat caused it to explode.
''We were unable to determine whether these injuries had been caused
by the offensive use of hand grenades, or if they had been activated by
the heat before or after they were overcome by heat and smoke,'' he
said.
However, British victim Phillip Henry, 22, from Manchester, one of six
members of the same family to die, had wounds from a fired gun, he said.
His brother Stephen, 26, had a bullet wound to the forehead.
The inquest was told the FBI refused to allow firefighters to tackle
the huge blaze until the building was virtually destroyed because of the
risk of fire crews being fired on.
The FBI rejected a suggestion that firefighters should be on stand-by
when they moved to end the siege on April 19, 1993, because of the
''unacceptable risk'' of the crews being shot at.
It was more than half an hour after the first signs of a blaze that
fire crews were allowed to approach the building, said Divisional
Officer Alan Stoker, of Greater Manchester Fire Service, who carried out
a detailed investigation into the blaze.
He said the building was effectively destroyed by the time any
firefighting operation was mounted.
The hearing continues.

AS LABOUR leader Tony Blair hit the campaign trail yesterday in a bid
to convince party doubters that Clause 4 of the party constitution must
be scrapped, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said he believed
opinion within Scottish constituencies was moving in the direction of
reform.
Mr Blair's efforts received a further Scotish boost when the largest
union in Scotland, Unison, swung its big guns in favour of the Clause 4
rewrite, backing the controversial U-turn by Shadow Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook.
Last night, the crusade for change was given a rousing launch in Mr
Blair's North-east England heartland, on the first stop of his tour, at
Gateshead.
Earlier, he told a Westminster news conference that a new Clause 4 was
an ''essential visible symbol '' of the new-style party and he promised
that its new constitution would be dominated by a call for social
justice.
Mr Robertson told Scots journalists that the immediate reaction of
some Scottish parties to Mr Blair's announcement last October that he
intended to rewrite the clause had been to defend the status quo.
Since then, he said, telephone and personal discussions with party
workers had convinced him and other Scottish supporters of change that
the debate is causing some second thoughts.
Next Wednesday is the deadline for amendments to motions submitted for
the Scottish Labour Party conference in Inverness in March and reformers
expect that a number will reflect a change of mood.
Mr Robertson intends to use his speech at the conference -- held just
a week before the national executive meets to approve a replacement for
the clause -- to put the case for modernisation.
Mr Blair is facing a close vote at the special conference in April,
when the outcome could depend on concessions he makes or does not make
to trade union leaders.
Meanwhile, the public sector union Unison announced that it would be
backing revision of the clause in an amendment to motions before the
Inverness conference in March.
There are 26 motions hostile in varying degrees to changing Clause 4,
but following Mr Cook's conversion to the reformist cause the union
modified its stance yesterday.
The union's Scottish affiliated political fund committee, representing
81,000 former members from former health and public sector unions Cohse
and Nupe, used their affiliation to the Labour Party to influence the
debate.
The committee, which does not represent non-aligned former Nalgo
members, backed a motion calling for Labour's fundamental values to be
defined in a ''clear and up-to-date manner.''
In language which echoed Mr Cook's watershed intervention, Unison said
Clause 4 should be redrafted provided it: reaffirmed commitment to
public ownership on grounds of efficiency and equity; sought to make the
private sector socially responsible and accountable; backed devolution;
and stressed Labour support for equality, social justice and
international solidarity.
The union's association Scottish secretary, Mr Bob Thomson, said:
''Although many within the union initially had reservations about the
timing of Tony Blair's initiative, it does provide an opportunity to
reaffirm Labour's traditional values in a modern context.''
The secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, Mr Jack McConnell, said
that amendments to motions for Inverness were now flowing in. ''We
already have some from constituency parties and some from trade unions,
but the most significant was from Unison.''
Organisers of the meeting at Gateshead last night emphasised there was
a broad cross-section of party views represented, but there were only a
few questions about the Clause 4 issue -- and the general view was that
Mr Blair's desire for modernisation was entirely acceptable.
Although he was very much on home ground -- just a short drive from
his own Sedgefield constituency in County Durham -- if last night's
session sets the tone for the rest of his tour it will not be a
difficult ride.
Mr Blair told the meeting: ''It is important we state what we actually
believe about public ownership.
''Of course there are key services that we want to be publicly owned
and publicly accountable. But we also know that we need a strong private
sector, a strong industrial base, a strong wealth-generating base for
our economy so that we can provide the services that we need.''
* The Labour Party is opening a branch in Hollywood aimed at
attracting British workers in the film capital. Behind the launch is
Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith, who is on a fact-finding tour of
the US.
He said: we estimate that there are over a quarter of a million UK
citizens working in California. Many of those working in the film
business will be natural Labour supporters.''
Labour already numbers among its MPs Oscar-winning actress Glenda
Jackson, but so far Labour Hollywood includes no film stars.

LABOUR called yesterday for the resignation of the board of Scottish
Homes in the wake of what it said were ''repeated and failed attempts to
allow tenants the choice of their own locally-elected councils as
alternative landlords''.
Labour also said it was launching a broader investigation into
Scottish Homes activities and had chosen the quango to be the subject of
debate in the Scottish Grand Committee on February 13.
The Labour attack came as the Government responded to a report from
the Commons watchdog Public Accounts Committee on the sale of 1200
houses in the Borders region to Waverley Housing. Some are said to have
changed hands for as little as #1.
The PAC said it was disturbed that the department allowed the contract
to be awarded without competition, and that it was concerned the
Scottish Office Environment Department did not respond to ''the
expression of interest by another landlord to whom they were later
prepared to consider selling the houses on offer''.
The Government responded to a series of PAC conclusions, noting many
of them and promising to tighten up procedures.
The Scottish Office noted the committee's concern and accepted the
''presumption'' that contracts should be let through competition.
Labour last night said that Scottish MPs had repeatedly met with the
chairman and chief executive of the Scottish Homes board, to press for
tenants' rights to choose their own landlord.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said he had written on
behalf of all 49 Scottish Labour MPs but on each occasion ''the
unelected board had adamantly refused to listen to the views of the
majority of elected Scottish representatives''.
Mr Robertson said: ''Choice over tenure change should be driven by
tenants, not quangos. If the board cannot grasp that basic democratic
principle they should go.''
Both the Scottish Office and Scottish Homes yesterday strongly
defended their conduct with regard to the sale three years ago.
The Public Accounts Committee report, published last November,
strongly criticised both of them. The committee was not satisfied they
had obtained the best possible price for the properties.
A #5.8m bid from the Trust was accepted by the housing agency although
one of the other bidders had offered #6.3m.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman said the Government maintained the
objectives for the sale were met, particularly with regard to tenants'
interests.
The chief executive of Scottish Homes, Mr Peter McKinlay, hit back at
allegations at the time, of the transaction being ''the sale of
century''.
He said there were conditions attached to the sale and the assertion
the agency should have received more money would be very difficult to
substantiate.
''In practice we do not believe there were any prospects for
increasing the price. Apart from other considerations the alternative
higher bid would not have won the support of tenants.''

MR BRIAN Wilson, MP for Cunninghame North, intends to raise questions
about several issues, including security, after a lifeboat had to
evacuate a psychiatric patient from the Isle of Arran who had absconded
from Crosshouse Hospital, in Kilmarnock.
The Troon boat was called out on Wednesday night to take the young
woman, in her 20s, back to the mainland.
The woman had been ''sectioned'' at the hospital but not detained in a
secure unit, said a spokeswoman for Ayrshire and Arran Community Health
Care NHS Trust which has responsibility for psychiatric services at
Crosshouse.
She left the hospital late on Tuesday afternoon and was brought back
at 2.30am on Thursday after a doctor on Arran decided that facilities on
the island were not suitable for detaining her overnight.
It was felt that while she posed no danger to other people, she might
be a danger to herself, said the Trust spokeswoman.
Two nurses -- one male, one female -- travelled from Crosshouse to
Arran to escort the patient back. The trust was not charged for the
evacuation because the lifeboat association at Troon is a charity and
performs rescue operations and hospital transport duties free of charge.
Mr Wilson, who along with the other Ayrshire MPs is meeting members of
Ayrshire and Arran Health Board and the hospital Trust today, said last
night: ''I shall now ask for this to be on the agenda and I shall be
seeking an explanation.
''It seems like a very odd story which raises several disturbing
questions.''
Mrs Margaret Jamieson, regional officer in Ayrshire and Arran for the
health union Unison, said the incident raised the question of why the
patient was not in a secure ward if she was had been ''sectioned'' under
the Mental Health Act.
''It raises the general problem of security throughout Trusts. Because
they are all paring their budgets, no special provision is given to the
psychiatric wards at Crosshouse or anywhere else,'' she said.
''We have got a problem with security if a patient can abscond from a
psychiatric unit. How we tackle this is the big problem,'' said Mrs
Jamieson.

A SCOTS doctor at the centre of a race row over deaths among his
patients in Zimbabwe was granted bail last night, pending his appeal
against a six-month jail sentence with hard labour, his lawyer said.
Richard McGown, 58, had appealed to the Supreme Court and Chief
Justice Antony Gubbay had granted him bail, lawyer Mark Stonier said.
But he added McGown was spending last night in prison and would be
freed today because the release order was signed after office hours.
On Wednesday, McGown was given a 12-month prison term, with six months
suspended, for being ''grossly negligent'' in the treatment of a
20-month-old boy who died hours after a circumcision.
He was also fined #800 -- or another six months in prison -- for the
death of a 10-year-old girl from inadequate post-surgery care.
Earlier yesterday, High Court Judge Paddington Garwe said he was
denying bail to McGown, born in India of Scottish parents, because the
doctor's appeal was sure to fail.
McGown, who denied being a racist, had pleaded not guilty to the
charges of culpable homicide.

A FATAL accident inquiry may be held into the death of the son of
millionaire motor dealer Arnold Clark, who was found dead in his
Helensburgh home early on Wednesday.
Mr Norman Clark, 33, is understood to have had a neck injury. He was
found in the kitchen of his detached villa in Lever Road, near
Helensburgh Golf Club, by his live-in girlfriend and work colleague,
Alice Robinson. Ms Robinson phoned 999 just before 6.30am.
It is understood Mr Clark asphyxiated himself. No-one else was
involved in the incident.
The couple worked at the Macharg Rennie and Lindsay group, in Partick,
Glasgow, one of more than 30 outlets operated by the Arnold Clark
Organisation in Scotland.
Ms Robinson's two teenage sons are also understood to have stayed with
the couple in Helensburgh. Mr Clark was recently divorced from his wife,
Caroline, and leaves an eight-year-old daughter, Kirsty. He was one of
four sons from Arnold Clark's first marriage.
His death was initially treated as suspicious. But senior police
officers confirmed late on Wednesday night that it was being treated as
a tragic accident.
The procurator-fiscal at Dumbarton, Mr Christopher Donnelly, confirmed
yesterday that a report would be submitted in due course to the Lord
Advocate, who would in turn decide whether or not a fatal accident
inquiry would be held.
A mandatory inquiry can be ordered only if a person is in legal
custody at the time of death or dies at their place of work. In other
cases an inquiry is held at the Lord Advocate's discretion.
Employees of the Arnold Clark Organisation throughout Scotland were
said to be still stunned yesterday by news of the death of the car
magnate's son.
The secretary of Mr Glen Gall, joint managing director of the motor
group, said no-one at the company was available for comment.
She added: ''It is purely a tragic and private bereavement.''
Mr David Clark, financial director and secretary of the Scottish Motor
Trade Association, said: ''Arnold is one of our most highly respected
members. We were absolutely horrified to hear of his son's death.
''Apart from being a top quality businessman, Arnold is also a very
nice person. We regret this tragedy has happened to a man who has put so
much into the motor trade.''
Mr Clark and his second wife, Philomena, are said to have been
devastated by the tragedy. They have two sons and four daughters --
John, Adam, Celia, Lucy, Stephanie and Amy.
The Arnold Clark Organisation is among the UK's 20 biggest car dealing
groups which controls more than 12% of new car franchises.
It is the biggest independent motor group in Scotland, with more than
30 sites. The group's annual turnover is estimated at #250m.

NO senior RAF officers will attend international ceremonies to mark
the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Dresden next month in eastern
Germany.
The military presence will be headed by Field Marshal Sir Peter Inge,
Chief of the Defence Staff, because of local sensitivities. The Duke of
Kent will represent the Queen.
''It was not thought that the light-blue uniform would be a good idea
in the circumstances,'' said a senior defence source.
The RAF is concerned it is about to be vilified once again for its
carpet-bombing raids on Dresden and other German cities. Senior officers
are warning staff throughout the air force to expect ''unwarranted''
vitriolic attacks over the next few months.
Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Beetham, president of the Bomber Command
Association, said: ''Although it is utterly outrageous, we have suffered
these attacks for so long, we are just about immune to them.''
The RAF is particularly concerned that the true facts about the
Dresden bombing are regularly ignored.
Data collated by the Air Historical Branch from original sources show
the choice of Dresden as a key target was made by the Allied joint
chiefs of staff rather than Sir Arthur ''Bomber'' Harris, chief of
Bomber Command, as often claimed.
A total of 796 Lancasters and nine Mosquitoes dropped 1478 tons of
high explosive and 1182 tons of incendiary bombs on February 13, 1945,
creating a huge firestorm that ravaged the city.
However, RAF sources stressed it was often forgotten that the one RAF
strike was followed by three raids by the US Air Force on February 14,
15, and March 2.
Although some post-war estimates put the number of deaths at 30,000 to
200,000, contemporary and official German records quoted 18,375 dead and
2212 seriously injured with the final death-toll expected to reach
25,000.
Much has been made about the timing of the attack coming as the end of
the war was in sight: but officials stressed the Allies had not yet
crossed the Rhine, the Germans were fighting tenaciously and almost 500
V2 rockets fell on Britain in February and March, 1945.
''As far as one could see the end could still have been some way off,
and no-one could forecast how it would come about,'' said the Historical
Branch. ''For every day the war was prolonged there were further heavy
losses of life, on both sides.''
In a letter dated March 29, 1945, Sir Arthur explained Dresden was a
mass of munition works, an intact government centre, and a key
transportation point to the East. ''It is now none of those things,'' he
wrote.
He emphasised attacks on cities were intolerable unless strategically
justified. But they were justified, he said, because they shortened the
war and preserved the lives of Allied soldiers.
He added: ''I take little delight in the work and none whatever in
risking my crews avoidably.''
Sir Michael added: ''It may sound cynical but Dresden was just another
target. It was a devastating blow to German morale and contributed to
Hitler's defeat.''
Britain, however, is acutely aware of the high emotions and
sensitivities the anniversary will create.
The Queen is donating an undisclosed sum from her private funds and
the Foreign Office #50,000 towards the reconstruction of Dresden's
Frauenkirche, one of Germany's finest Baroque churches abandoned as a
ruin since 1945.

<TEXT>
AN NHS Trust has received 70 inquiries from British and European
companies interested in building and running a new psychiatric unit in
Glasgow.
The 140-bed facility is to be built at a cost of nearly #6m by the
Greater Glasgow Community and Mental Health Services Trust.
It will be situated in the grounds of Stobhill Hospital and provide
acute in-patient and respite care to replace Woodilee Hospital in
Lenzie, which is to close next year.
Under the Government's private finance initiative the Trust has to
explore the possibility of raising private capital for the project, and
have advertised in the European Union Journal, chief executive Tim
Davison said yesterday.
The options being considered range from a build-and-lease agreement to
an arrangement in which an outside company would run the unit, providing
the support staff and services as well as the building and equipment.
However, this would not include clinical services and Mr Davison said:
''Trust staff will continue to provide high quality health care for NHS
patients free of charge, regardless of who owns or has paid for the
building.''
The formal expressions of interest will be narrowed down to three
companies or consortia with a track record in health care, who will be
asked to submit detailed tenders and costs. They will be considered
alongside a fourth option -- the use of conventional public finance --
before a choice is submitted to the Scottish Office for approval.
Using conventional public financing from the Treasury, the Trust would
have to pay a 6% annual return on the capital.

TWO Scottish universities are involved in the possible formation of a
UK consortium which would raise up to #100m on the capital markets for
building projects.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents
higher education chiefs, said yesterday 19 UK universities had taken
part in discussions about raising the money via bond issues.
The Scottish ones are Paisley and Edinburgh universities. A spokesman
for Edinburgh said: ''We have already had experience of bond-based
funding. We have been offering help and advice with this development.''
Mr David Rigg, academic registrar at Paisley, said: ''This university
and others have declared an interest in the proposal, but it is at a
very early stage. We need to know more about the technical aspects, such
as the terms of the money and the strings attached.''
The proposal to give universities a capital market debut came from the
CVCP, which hopes the bond issue can take place this year. A spokesman
said: ''Given that public funding for capital projects is small and in
danger of drying up completely, universities need to diversify their
sources of loan finance.''
The CVCP commissioned a report from European Capital and a solicitors'
firm which described how universities and colleges could issue bonds to
raise badly-needed finances for their expansion plans, and to update
facilities.
Universities have tended to use the clearing banks and building
societies to finance projects.
The main benefit of raising money on the capital markets comes from
borrowing long-term at a fixed interest rate, compared with short-term
bank and building society loans subject to interest rate fluctuations.
The CVCP spokesman said: ''If you have a significant amount of loan
outstanding it is desirable for some to be fixed so that for 25 years
your cash flow will not be affected by interest rate changes and you
know what your costs will be.''
A director of European Capital, Mr Maurice Hochschild, said: ''There
is still plenty of hard work to be done . . . but we hope to be able to
contact potential underwriters in the near future.''

SINN Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness, yesterday accused Prime
Minister John Major of dragging his heels over Northern Ireland and
putting the whole peace process at risk, at the start of a three-day
visit to Britain.
Mr McGuinness said: ''I have come here in peace'', as he arrived in
London to begin a tour which will take him to Manchester and Birmingham.
His visit appears to be timed to coincide with talks between Northern
Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and Irish Foreign Minister, Mr
Dick Spring, on a joint framework document for the next stage of the
peace process.
Yesterday Mr McGuinness met MPs of various parties in the House of
Commons. Earlier he told a news conference: ''What we are trying to do
is to convince all parties to this conflict that it is absolutely
essential that the momentum of the peace process be kept up and that
there should be no stalling, no dragging of feet, and that we move on
decisively.
''It is time for the British Government to give very clear indications
that that is going to be the case,'' he stressed.
He then addressed his comments to Unionist opponents of the peace
process. He said: ''It is time for the Unionists to stop behaving like
spoilt children and to recognise that their future is on the island of
Ireland.
''We are not asking them to cease to become British. What we are
asking them to do is to accept that a totally new situation has opened
up before us.''
He claimed that the failure of the British Government to sit around
the table with all parties involved -- five months after the guns had
gone silent following the IRA ceasefire -- was disgraceful.
Mr McGuinness was clearly upset by a report which implied that the
framework document between the Irish and British Governments could lead
to Unionists being given a veto on North-South institutions.
''If issues at the heart of this conflict are not resolved, then the
potential for further conflict will always be there,'' Mr McGuinness
said.

EXCLUSIVE
ONE of Scotland's leading industrialists, Viscount Weir of Eastwood,
yesterday returned to hospital to thank the doctors and nurses who
treated him when he was badly injured in a road accident four months
ago.
Lord Weir, 61, chairman of the Weir Group, suffered multiple injuries
when the Jaguar he was driving was hit by another car on the A77.
Firefighters and paramedics had to free him from the wreckage before he
could be airlifted to Crosshouse Hospital near Kilmarnock.
He spent three weeks at the hospital, staying in the intensive therapy
unit until his condition became stable, then being transferred to the
orthopaedic ward.
Yesterday, Lord Weir was invited back by the North Ayrshire and Arran
NHS Trust to Crosshouse's accident and emergency unit to perform the
official inauguration of a new kind of nursing service there.
The occasion gave him the opportunity to meet again the medical team
who had cared for him and to thank them for all they did.
''They were all absolutely marvellous. They were also extremely kind
and considerate and very cheerful,'' he told The Herald when asked what
he thought of those who had treated him.
It was also a chance for him to show them the remarkable recovery he
has made since the accident. Although he requires two sticks, meantime,
to walk, the doctors and nurses were clearly delighted at his progress.
The accident has certainly done nothing to damage his sense of humour,
and he happily exchanged jokes with the staff.
His brief tour included a visit to the resuscitation room, where he
had been rushed on arrival at the hospital after the accident, and the
intensive therapy unit. He agreed when nurses said he would not remember
much about his initial treatment, but added: ''I can remember being
somewhere in a hospital.''
Since being discharged from Crosshouse, Lord Weir has been receiving
physiotherapy as an outpatient there.
The accident in September last year happened when a stolen car
collided head-on with his Jaguar, about four miles south of Newton
Mearns. The three men in the other vehicle all died.
Firefighters said at the time that Lord Weir owed his life to the
airbag fitted in his car.
Despite his extensive injuries, Lord Weir was quick to get back to
business. Within a few days of the accident, he was working on documents
as he lay in his hospital bed.
The new nursing system which was officially launched yesterday is one
of the first of its kind in Scotland. The ''triage'' system is being
implemented in accordance with a Government working group's
recommendations and will ensure that all patients are assessed by a
trained nurse on arrival at the accident and emergency unit.
The triage nurse will determine the urgency of the patient's problem
and co-ordinate the appropriate treatment. Patients requiring emergency
resuscitation will be seen immediately by a doctor.
A spokeswoman for the North Ayrshire and Arran NHS Trust said: ''It is
anticipated that the new service will reduce patient anxiety levels
following immediate assessment, improve the communications with
patients, their relatives and other outside agencies, and reduce waiting
times for patients as resources are used more effectively.''
The word triage comes from the prefix ''tri'' denoting the three
stages of treatment -- emergency care, intermediate care, and walking
wounded. The term first came to prominence within the armed forces.

CONVICTED child killer Robert Black's appeal is due to be heard next
month. The hearing, expected to last up to three days, has been given a
provisional starting date of February 20 at the Court of Appeal in
London.
Black, 47, was given 10 life sentences at Newcastle Crown Court last
May after he was convicted of abducting and murdering schoolgirls Susan
Maxwell of Coldstream; Caroline Hogg, of Edinburgh; and Sarah Harper, of
Leeds. Three judges will hear Black's appeal.

A FAULTY train, in a breach of safety rules, was allowed to continue
running on one of Scotland's busiest commuter lines at the evening rush
hour, The Herald has discovered. An internal inquiry is under way into
the incident.
It was only by luck the train did not decouple -- for a second time --
when sent on by staff after the original incident, according to a
Railtrack document in the possession of The Herald.
The circumstances raise numerous questions about responsibilities for
passenger safety in the wake of the rail industry's fragmentation in the
run-up to privatisation.
Springburn Labour MP Michael Martin said last night he would raise the
issues with Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney and demand ''a thorough
investigation into the shocking and distressing'' scenario as outlined
by the Railtrack document.
It reveals a 17.09 Springburn to Milngavie train had uncoupled near
High Street station in Glasgow. The two portions came to a halt just
three feet apart. Passengers disembarked, without injury.
Staff then decided the train and its six carriages would be coupled
together again. It was sent forward, albeit empty, to Yoker depot.
On arrival, it was discovered the locking device had failed to engage
fully on the coupling of one unit. Subsequent tests also found one of
the couplers was defective. It had to be replaced.
The document adds it was considered lucky that the recoupled train
''had not divided for a second time en route (document's emphasis) from
High Street to Yoker Depot''.
Railtrack's safety rule book stipulates that after a train fitted with
Tightlock autocouplers has divided no attempt to recouple should be made
without authority from its maintenance and electrical engineering
department.
ScotRail, the train operator, and Railtrack, responsible for
infrastructure, yesterday denied a Newton-style disaster could have
occurred had the train uncoupled again and stopped on the High Street to
Yoker stretch of the line.
Both argued there were no safety implications because a second
standstill would have shown up on a sophisticated control panel and
signals would have automatically turned red, stopping all other trains
on the route.
However, Mr Martin said ''human error'' could never be ruled out. He
referred to fatal crashes at Newton in Lanarkshire, where controllers
were powerless to stop a collision when a train passed a red light, and
on the Springburn-Milngavie line, when trains collided at Bellgrove in
1989.
He said of the decoupling incident: ''I am shocked and distressed at
what appears to have been very sloppy procedures. I will be raising this
matter with the Transport Secretary, and calling for a thorough
investigation. Where the public is concerned, safety procedures must be
101% at all times.''
ScotRail and Railtrack were reluctant to comment fully, citing fears
of prejudice because disciplinary action against their staff could
follow the internal inquiry. It would appear staff on the ground, who
allegedly sent the train forward without authority from control, did so
through desperation to avoid further, lengthy rush-hour delays caused by
the original uncoupling, according to sources.
In referring to last month's Springburn-Milngavie incident, an All
Points Bulletin, just issued to staff by Railtrack's safety section,
underlines the correct procedures to be adopted when Tightlock
autocouplers on trains divide.
It states: ''Recoupling should not be attempted without the authority
of the M&amp;EE department, who can be contacted via Production Control.
Equally, it is important that 'on the ground' staff can identify when
Tightlock couplers are correctly locked . . .''
A Railtrack spokesman said decoupling was extremely rare. When it
happened, air brakes would separate and the train sections come to a
standstill, alerting the control room.
* A rail union claims five out of six accidents, in which 48 have
died, would have been preventable by the Automatic Train Protection
system.

<TEXT>
MYRA Hindley will fake a hypnotic trance when she tries to locate the
body of the Moors murders victim Keith Bennett, says her former lover,
Ian Brady.
Brady dismissed the exercise as a ''theatrical event'' which Hindley
would use as part of her campaign to gain her freedom from jail.
The prisons Minister, Mr Michael Forsyth, gave the go-ahead this week
for Hindley to be hypnotised, in an attempt to find the body of Keith,
the 12-year-old whom Brady and Hindley killed in 1964.
Glasgow-born Brady, imprisoned at Ashworth special hospital,
Merseyside, responded to the decision in a letter sent to the Home
Secretary, Mr Michael Howard.
He said that eight years ago, during searches for more bodies around
the moors near Manchester, he offered to take a ''truth drug''.
Hindley, he claimed, ''immediately copied by offering to be
hypnotised, and had been using the gambit as a public relations exercise
ever since''.
Brady said that Hindley, serving her sentence at Cookham Wood jail, in
Kent, ''intends to sham hypnotic trance and use it as a front to change
her story yet again without being discredited.''
He added: ''Her real energy will be concentrated upon using the
European Court to overturn the Home Secretary's decision that she should
remain in prison for life.''

ERIC Cantona's footballing career was in doubt last night after he was
charged with misconduct by the Football Association.
The Manchester United player faces the prospect of a lengthy ban after
his brawl with Crystal Palace supporters on Wednesday night.
After a board meeting last night, Mr Martin Edwards, the chairman of
Manchester United, left Old Trafford without making any coment.
The French soccer authorities also indicated his international career
may be at an end.
Endless television replays yesterday showed the moments of madness,
when Cantona, 28, sent off for foul play, launched himself feet-first
into the Selhurst Park crowd.
The victim of Eric Cantona's two-footed kick said the attack was ''a
big shock'' and ''came completely out of the blue''.
Mr Matthew Simmonds, 23, received a gash across his chest and bruising
to the face.
Mr Michael Pickett, 30, a close friend of Mr Simmonds and who
witnessed the incident, said he had spoken with his friend at London's
South Norwood Police Station yesterday morning.
Mr Pickett said: ''He said he was totally shocked. He said: 'Why has
it happened? It is football, it is general banter. Why has he attacked
me?
''It was out of the blue. Everybody was giving it the banter and
Cantona has jumped over. He kicked me, I sat up and then I was hit.''
Mr Pickett added: ''He said he was not happy at all, he was hurting
inside because what happened was such a shock.''
Mr Pickett said that Mr Simmons, a glazier, had run to the front of
the stand from his seat 11 rows back to taunt the player. Mr Pickett was
''amazed'' by Cantona's reaction.
''I have never seen anything like it. The first I knew anything was
going to happen was when Cantona stepped back and bosh! he was over the
fence.
''He was over the fence and he was punching and kicking Matty, who
wasn't giving him any resistance.''
He said his friend had been giving Cantona ''a bit of verbal'' but
added: ''It was no worse than you hear at any football match.''
Mr Simmons may face losing his Palace season ticket over his role in
the incident, Mr Pickett claimed.
Mr Graham Kelly, the FA's chief executive, called the incident a
''stain on the game''.
He said: ''It has brought shame on those involved and the game
itself.''
Claude Simonet, the president of the French Football Federation, said:
''Eric Cantona was captain yesterday, but I can't say if he will be
captain tomorrow. It seems to be incompatible after an action such as
that.''
Police said Cantona and United midfielder Paul Ince would be
questioned ''in due course''.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said that one spectator had alleged assault
by the Frenchman, another assault by Ince.

THE Northern Ireland Secretary has urged supreme caution on the
Cabinet over the controversial issue of the jailed paratrooper, Private
Lee Clegg.
Sir Patrick Mayhew told his colleagues yesterday he intends to play it
straight down the line of legal process without any political overtones.
It could be a blow to Clegg's supporters. The media campaigns to get
him out of jail and returned to his unit on licence quickly are not
being supported by Sir Patrick.
Ministers are increasingly concerned that the case of Private Clegg,
jailed for the murder of a passenger of a joyrider who crashed through a
military checkpoint, will damage the peace process.
Yesterday this ran into another barrier when, after long talks in
London, the Irish and British Governments appeared deadlocked on the
next step.
The Prime Minister told the Commons after the Cabinet meeting: ''Sir
Patrick will have to consider any new evidence put to him and decide
firstly whether that's sufficient to warrant a further reference to the
Court of Appeal. In the meantime, the proper procedures have now
begun.''
There has been a huge campaign for Private Clegg's release from his
life sentence since the Law Lords turned down his appeal last week
against his conviction. Clegg was one of a group of paratroopers who
fired at a car driven by joyriders which failed to stop at a Belfast
roadblock. Karen Reilly, 18, a back seat passenger, died.
Ministers are now seriously concerned that newspaper campaigns have
highlighted the case to such an extent that if Clegg is released quickly
there would be outrage in the Roman Catholic community in Northern
Ireland and within the new Dublin Government.
During his trial and that of other soldiers from the Third Battalion
of the Parachute Regiment, compelling evidence was considered by the
trial judge indicating that there was a conspiracy to react severely
against the next set of joyriders who crashed through the Belfast Army
road barrier.
Sir Patrick and the Irish Foreign Secretary, Mr Dick Spring, worked
for seven hours in London, yesterday to try to complete negotiations on
a joint framework document designed to point the way for the Northern
Ireland constitutional political parties to negotiate a permanent
settlement after 25 years of violence.
Afterwards Sir Patrick said there were still a ''few areas of
complexity'' to be resolved. Officials of the two countries had produced
a ''long and balanced'' document for them to discuss. Large segments of
it are agreed but further work needs to be done.
Mr Spring said he was optimistic that the areas of difference could be
resolved. ''I believe we can all be confident that we can overcome the
remaining differences between us.'' They would not itemise the
outstanding differences. Sir Patrick said that they were happy with the
progress made. ''It is a process that is on the move.''
They were discussing a 23-page document drawn up by civil servants.
The sticking points are constitutional changes the Governments would
have to make concerning the British Government of Ireland Act and the
Irish Articles Two and Three of the Dublin Constitution, which still lay
claim to all Ireland.
The two Governments are still deadlocked on the extent of cross-border
co-operation in things like tourism, fisheries and economic action to
exploit the five-month ceasefire.
The failure to settle such issues yesterday at Lancaster House means
it could be another month before Mr Major and the new Irish Prime
Minister, Mr John Bruton, can hold a summit meeting to publish their
suggestions for constitutional change.
Meanwhile Mr Bruton and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams will have their
first formal meeting in Dublin today. Top of the agenda will be the
progress being made in negotiations towards drafting a framework
document to permit a fresh inter-party dialogue in Northern Ireland.

TOTAL returns in all three property sectors slowed down in the year to
end December 1994, according to the latest Richard Ellis Scottish
Monthly Index (Resmi) -- prepared exclusively for The Herald.
All Property ended the year to stand at just under 21%, compared with
a total return of 22.3% on the December 1993 figure. This decline in
total performance was due to the favourable month of December 1993
falling out of the index.
The industrial sector registered 19.7%, representing a fall of 6.5
percentage points from last month; offices produced 21.7%; retail
recorded just over 20%.
A similar pattern emerged with a slowdown in the annual rate of
capital growth for All Property which produced 12.2%. For the first time
since September 1993, industrial capital growth registered below 10%,
despite an increase in capital values during the month -- again due to
the favourable figures of December 1993 falling out of the index.
The retail and office sectors recorded capital growth of 13% and 12.9%
respectively. Over the month retail capital values grew by a healthy
1.3%, industrial values rose by 0.3%, but office values fell by the same
amount. Overall property values rose by 0.4% in December.
In terms of rental growth, none of the sectors witnessed any movement
in rental values in December. Annual rental growth for the industrial
market remained unchanged from November to stand at 2%, retail produced
1% rental growth, and offices recorded -1.5%.
For the full 12 months to December All Property rental values grew by
0.3%.
Year to end December 1994

SCOTLAND'S banks are more patriotic in their property investment
decisions than Scottish insurance companies which tend to prefer to
invest south of the border, claims one of Scotland's senior surveyors.
Introducing his firm's annual report on the Scottish property market,
David Wright of property consultants Weatherall Green &amp; Smith said the
Scottish banks were important supporters of property investment last
year.
''The Scottish banks have continued their support of Scottish property
sectors during the past year -- and there is increasing evidence that
their hands-on approach has been more prudent than the less patient
approach taken in many cases by their English counterparts,'' he said.
''On the other hand, there is not the same continuing support to
Scottish property from the Scottish assurance institutions.'' The
insurers had not been prominent bidders in Scottish investment sales --
in a number of cases they actually disinvested in Scotland, yet were
active buyers in the South-east of England.
English-based funds and property companies were tending to become the
largest investors in Scottish property.
David Wright went on to predict increasing confidence in Scotland's
market this year. ''In recent months there has been an uplift in
interest rates -- and we are subjected to a government which limps from
one crisis to another -- but these unfavourable factors are offset by
the fact that real estate is still cheap in historic terms,'' he said.
The Weatherall report, Scotland 95, highlights out-of-town retailing
as the most active sector north of the border. Ironically, the very
reason these parks were developed -- low rentals and easy access -- had
now turned full circle. Rentals were now on a par with some town centres
and some retail parks had developed their very own traffic jams and
delays.

THIS week's announcement of a #50m redevelopment of Cumbernauld Town
Centre offers one of the most important opportunities for retail
expansion in Scotland in recent years.
With most town centres already redeveloped over the past 10 years, and
a Scotish Office brake on out-of-town development widely expected,
considerable interest from major retail chains can be expected. The
scheme will be carried out by Arrowcroft Group plc and represents a
final major flourish from Cumbernauld Development Corporation before it
is wound up.
David Mitchell, the corporation's chairman, said: ''The redevelopment
is the single most important project the corporation has embarked upon,
and it will provide the range and quality of shopping facilities
required to meet the needs of residents of the town and surrounding
communities well into the next century.''
The project will provide 300,000 sq ft of additional shopping,
including four anchor stores, about 50 individual shops, 1200 car
parking spaces, and a new bus station.
On completion, it will have almost doubled the existing shopping to
around 675,000 sq ft and increased the total number of car parking
spaces to more than 3000.
The development will be fully integrated with the existing shopping
centre and a new civic square will be created adjacent to the bus
station. Extensive alterations will be made to existing traffic
management and pedestrian circulation at the town centre.
Central Way (part of the A8011), which has bisected the central area
since it was originally constructed in the mid-sixties, will be closed
to through traffic and the existing Asda store relocated. Asda is
investing #13.8m in the construction of a new 45,000 sq ft (net) store
at Central Way and Tryst Road.
The first stage of the road alterations at the centre is due to start
at the end of this month. Roundabouts will be created on Carbrain Road
and a new car park formed on part of the former Seafar Primary School
site. The other roadworks alterations involved will take place
progressively during 1995 and 1996.
Daniel Carter, a director of Arrowcroft, said: ''The physical layout
of Cumbernauld's central area will be totally transformed. We will
increase the range and choice of shopping facilities by specifically
targeting major store groups and high-street retailers not presently
represented in the centre.
''The whole area will be pedestrianised. Construction work on the new
shops will start as soon as the existing Asda store has been demolished,
and the first of the new shopping outlets will open for business towards
the end of 1997.''

THE HISTORY OF healthcare management in the NHS is to a large extent a
history of attempts to solve two key management problems -- how to
allocate scarce resources, and how to manage those resources in order to
deliver a service that combines efficiency with appropriate social
objectives.
Throughout the history of the NHS reforms, four different methods of
achieving these efficiencies competed for primacy -- planning, politics,
managerialism, and the market.
The planning approach was very much in tune with the times in the late
1940s and during the 1950s. It went alongside the nationalisation of key
industries such as coal and steel, which were run on centrally-planned
lines in the monolithic highly-centralised bureaucratic forms of
organisation, but where the nationalised industries had blue-collar
workforces, the NHS had doctors and nurses.
Doctors and nurses would not, could not, and probably should not be
incorporated into a monolithic management bureaucracy and from the
earliest days a federal structure was set up. Doctors had their own
organisation, based very largely on collegial principles. The nurses
were separately organised under hospital matrons and the hospital system
was served by a third group -- the hospital administrators.
Partly because of the problems created by this uneasy combination, and
partly for political reasons, the 1980s saw a dramatic shift from the
principles of politics and planning to those of managerialism and the
market.
I think there is quite a lot to be said in favour of these changes.
I would have preferred them to have come from a government that I was
sure was committed to the underlying principles of the NHS, and perhaps
the process by which they have been introduced could have been much
better managed, but there is much to be said for market mechanisms and
even more to be said for people who are well-trained in professional
management practices.
In a Boston hospital recently the head of nursing services told me of
their research into how to reduce length of patient stay. She believed
that many of their procedures were based on tradition and rule-of-thumb
rather than on any scientifically tested principles and she told me they
were mounting a series of experiments to find the optimum periods for
convalescence.
Hospitals are probably like most other organisations in this regard.
It is probable that the standard routines for delivering healthcare are
bound to some extent by tradition and also reflect political processes
of various interest groups who have established procedures that make
life easier for them.
Mechanisms that enable a search for more efficient ways of doing
things, and mechanisms that allow the patients' interests to have more
weight could make a contribution. The market mechanisms and the new
roles for managers set up by the recent reforms could be partial
answers.
Having Commissioners and GPs who are exercising choice about which
service to buy may make providers ask questions about what these
customers actually want, rather than focusing on what they can provide.
Similarly, having someone with managerial responsibility for the
delivery of a service may enable the questions to be raised and answered
about how the delivery might be improved -- and the change process to be
managed.
Although market mechanisms and managerial practices have their
relevance, there are dangers. One is in imposing a version of
administrative practice that is already both old-fashioned and
stereotyped. The other danger is a lack of sensitivity to the real
challenges to efficient and effective management posed by the existence
of several highly qualified, relatively autonomous, sets of
practitioners within the service, ie the medical, paramedical, and
nursing occupations.
In the past, the NHS was being asked to accept innovations which had
been adopted in the private sector -- the multi-divisional
organisational form, corporate planning, systems of accountability and
responsibility, etc -- but these were sometimes imposed merely as a set
of mechanisms without there being an awareness of the subtleties and
nuances with which they were actually used in the private sector.
Similarly, I believe that in the 1990s we are seeing the imposition of
market relationships, competitive tendering, contracting, and so forth,
without the realisation of what a subtle and high-trust relationship
often exists between provider and supplier in the most advanced private
sector enterprises.
The other matter of major importance is that of the role of the highly
qualified technical specialists. We are in danger of imposing a system
of managers on the NHS without taking due recognition of the presence of
these central technical occupations. I am in favour of managerialism,
but not of it being the exclusive concern of professional managers.
A great deal of thinking needs to be done about the role of
clinicians, nurses and paramedics in management structures, particularly
vis-a-vis professional managers.
What structures do we need, what training should each of these groups
have in management and administration? What information systems do we
need, providing information to whom? How is customer awareness best
fostered?
At a time when authorities such as Charles Handy are identifying the
federal form of organisation as a good model for high-technology private
enterprises, it would be foolish to throw away the best bits of
federalism in hospitals.
There is a need to provide management education for all senior
healthcare staff whether medical, nursing, paramedical, administrative
or whatever. And I use the word ''education'' rather than ''training''.
We should not be in the business of recycling current private sector
management practices. Our programmes should be concerned with sharing
some of the management principles underlying these practices, in
equipping healthcare staff with the means to be flexible in developing
appropriate management practices, and in fostering organisational
learning to cope with the changing demands of healthcare delivery
through to the next century.
Arthur Francis, Professor of Corporate Strategy at the University of
Glasgow Business School's Healthcare Management Centre, was talking to
Yvonne Wightman.

Car repairs and servicing on your doorstep: that is the concept which
is proving a winner for a young entrepreneur who, as Janet Reid
discovers, is just moving into top gear when it comes to good ideas
YOUNG entrepreneur David McLaughlin doen't need publicity, thank you
very much. What he would really like, if he could wave a magic spanner,
is 48 hours in every day. Already, after only eight months in business,
he is having to burn the midnight oil far too often in order to satisfy
his customers' demands.
McLaughlin is a mechanic and founder-owner of Motor Mend, a garage on
wheels. Self-styled Knight of the Road, his expertise is such that
motorists in the Greater Glasgow area are clamouring for his services,
most of them alerted to his skills by recommendations from their
friends.
McLaughlin set up Motor Mend last May with advice from Drumchapel
Business Centre and financial help from the local Enterprise Action Fund
and the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust. He was the first
recipient of a grant from the Trust to come from Drumchapel.
His involvement with cars goes back as far as he can remember. As a
kid he would go round scrapyards with his father, who was a motor
mechanic; and his uncles' boots were as familiar to him as their faces,
for he spent hours watching them too, stretched out beneath ailing
motors.
AS soon as he left school he tried to get an apprenticeship. One year
under the auspices of the YTS scheme and three years of traditional
apprenticeship later and he was a fully qualified motor mechanic with a
string of qualifications to his name.
These included certificates from the City and Guilds and the Road
Transport Industrial Training Board, and increasingly, as he moved from
the Ford garage where he trained to another specialist garage (this time
one which concentrated on restoring old Spitfires and MGBs) he felt he
could provide a better service on his own.
Too many garages, he says, either rely on semi-skilled labour and
provide a second-rate srvice, or else making profits at the expense of
their skilled workforce who are not given enough time to do a
conscientious job.
He decided to pioneer a new approach. This would
provide customers with a service which was thorough, expert, and of a
high quality. But instead of opening a static garage workshop, he hit on
the novel idea of setting up a mobile garage on wheels.
This garage, he is at pains to emphasise, could not be further removed
from the cowboy mechanics whose jolting, dented van filled with dirty
tools and oily rags lives up to every dismal expectation and only
reflects the shoddy efforts of its owner. McLaughlin's Transit van
(bought second-hand from ScottishPower) is immaculate inside and out --
its shiny cleanliness intended to convey the superiority of his motor
repair and service provision.
He is so busy that he plans to take on his own apprentice shortly. In
the longer term, he plans to get a couple of breakdown wagons and
another three or four vans so that he can offer the same comprehensive
repair and servicing as ordinary garages, but with the bonuses to the
customer of convenience and competitive prices.
Even now, he is able to offer a wide range of services to customers
from as far as Milngavie and Blanefield in the north to Giffnock and
Johnstone in the south. He is qualified and capable of dealing with
mechanical, electrical, coachbuilding and security problems; he can
service any make of car; and because it's in his own interest to get
jobs finished quickly, if he has to get parts he'll drive off and get
them. Not that this is usually necessary -- he carries a selection of
fan belts, sparking plugs and so on.
And while he rapidly pays off his insurance (at #2000, twice what he
paid for his van, and his largest outlay), he leaves no stone unturned
in his pursuit of business growth.
Having completed various training courses in marketing and
book-keeping, he keeps abreast of modern motor technology by going on
more advanced mechanical, electronic and welding courses; and last month
he started an evening class in computers.
Once he has mastered spread sheets and data bases, his intention is to
computerise: to be as professional as his dentist who sends out cards to
advise customers of their annual check-ups.
Some might say that Motor Mend is already upstaging his dentist.
Though the teeth McLaughlin deals with are the serrated ones on cogs
beneath the bonnet, he wears surgical gloves to maintain scrupulous
cleanliness. And he changes his overalls at least once every day.

IN this, the first column of 1995, Finger on The Pulse looks to the
future. We want to know what's in store for West of Scotland business
this year. Will 1995 bring prosperity or poverty, delight or depression?
A recent report published by The Economist claims to have the answers.
Scotland has every reason to celebrate 1995, it predicts. It even
suggests that the celebrations might carry on well into 1996 -- Soaraway
Scotland, in fact!
In a list of economic predictions for the coming year, the report
anticipates that the Scottish economy will grow faster than it has done
in the past two years. But that's not all. It also predicts that
Scotland will outperform the rest of the UK, unemployment will fall, and
exports will accelerate.
The good news for Scotland is in stark contrast to the report's
overall forecast for Britain. It gloomily warns that the best is over
for Britain -- that this year will see the economy decelerate, living
standards slip, and falls in unemployment reduced to a trickle.
The only New Year cheer that the report offers to Britain is that
there will be no return to recession. However, this is cold comfort when
it also predicts that Britain will lose its place as the strongest
economy in Europe and will find itself sliding to the bottom of the
international pile.
However, the message for Scotland is optimistically upbeat and as we
now move into 1995 business confidence seems to be returning, order
books have picked up, the electronic sector continues to perform well,
and the oil industry seems to be back on track.
But a year is a long time in business and as we move in to 1995 what
are the main economic indicators?
FTSE-100Up 0.5 points to 3054.9
Retail Price IndexUp x% to 145.3
Headline inflation2.9% (up 0.5%)
Underlying inflation2.5% (up 0.2%)
Seasonal food pricesUp 0.1%
Scotland's unemploymentDown x%
Growth in average earningsSteady at x%
Manufacturing productivityUp x%
Factory gate pricesUp x%.
What exactly does all this mean? Are The Economist's predictions
correct? Is Scotland set to soar this year? We had a word with some
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce members -- the voice of West of Scotland
Business today. Is ''Soar-away Scotland'' a myth or a reality?
Marilyn Orcharton, Managing Director at Kite Consultants Ltd,
certainly sees Scotland soaring this year and believes women will play a
large part in the success.
''I think 1995 will be a very successful year for Scottish
businesswomen, marked with the launch of the World Association of Women
Entrepreneurs taking place here in Scotland,'' she says.
''And on a more general scale, I think 1995 will be an excellent year
for Scotland. Many inward investors are already making plans to increase
their workforces, and there is a definite buzz of excitement among
chamber members when they talk of opportunities for this year.
''The current media attention that Scotland us getting over the
devolution question is also raising awareness of Scotland's business
capacity.''
Meanwhile David Semple, Chairman of Semple Fraser WS, the business law
partnership, sees 1995 as the year of the entrepreneur but offers a word
of warning:
''We are now seeing an increase in activity by entrepreneurs in
Scotland who have been looking at deals for some time and have come to
the conclusion that there will not be a better time to do them,'' he
says.
''This promises to be a good year for setting up, developing, and
buying and selling businesses. It's just a shame that the ethic here in
Scotland is so anti-entrepreneurial. This will certainly hold us back
compared to our economically successful competitors -- including
England.''
Frank Blin, Managing Partner at Coopers and Lybrand, is quietly
confident about the coming year. Indeed, he reveals that the company's
merger and acquisition broking service is currently witnessing an
increased level of activity.
''I think that this year will bring a change of emphasis on the type
of deals we complete, moving away from the restructuring of businesses
in difficulty or the creation of phoenix-from-the-ashes rescues,'' he
says.
''There are now a number of institutionally-backed businesses who have
come through a difficult recessionary trading period well. In my view
these businesses will now become more active, be it in initiating
mergers, acquisitions or joint ventures, and we are optimistically
looking forward to growth and activity.''
A more cautious note comes from Duncan Tannahill, General Manager at
Lex Vauxhall.
''The motor industry, which represents the UK's biggest manufacturing
industry, has started 1995 on a disappointing note with a 16% decrease
in its market registrations of new cars compared to the start of January
last year,'' he says.
''Until uncertainty decreases and confidence at home returns, then
volumes and margins are likely to remain under extreme pressure in 1995.
However, in saying all of this, there are positive signs of renewing
consumer interest in vehicle products which promises much for 1995. I
just hope that the optimism delivers.''
Meanwhile, Sue Bartley at Casual Cuisine Catering has her own views.
''As a small family business we have probably felt the pinch less than
most,'' she says. ''We are able to cut overheads and adapt reasonably
easily to changing market demands.
''I am sure 1995 will see a significant increase in business activity,
but any 'soaring' could still be mixed with a fair bit of 'hovering'.
However, I'm confident that by the end of 1995 Scottish businesses will
be doing a little more celebrating than last year.''
We asked Glasgow Chamber's Chief Executive, Geoff Runcie, to put all
of this into perspective. ''The recent Scottish Chambers and Fraser of
Allander Survey highlighted Scotland's improving performance and
optimism for the coming year,'' he points out.
''This was particularly gratifying in relation to a lack of optimism
in other parts of the UK. The members of the Chamber who have
contributed to our column are all striking an optimistic note, and
despite a cautionary comment in one or two places, I do believe that
1995 is a year when we must take grasp of the opportunities at every
corner.
''It is easy to get hung up on analysis of trends but we must remember
that the recent recession was unique in many respects, not only because
of its depth but because of the length of time during which businesses
were affected. We don't have a model on which to base our projections in
recent history, so optimism is surely a very powerful tool in causing
things to happen rather than waiting for them to happen.
''Being cautious is fine and prudent: quality decisions about business
investment and development have always been the hallmark of Scottish
business and I don't see why that should change now.
''But seeking out the real opportunities is equally part of something
that the Scots are well known for: so let's go for it in 1995!
