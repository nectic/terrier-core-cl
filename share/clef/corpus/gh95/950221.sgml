LLOYDS Bank is to ask its shareholders to approve the #1800m purchase
of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society at an extraordinary
general meeting on March 30, it was revealed yesterday as C&amp;G, itself,
began sending out its long awaited documents on the proposed takeover to
its savers and depositors.
The bank's share price, though, tumbled 19p to 556p yesterday as it
confirmed that there are no plans for branch closures or staff
redundancies at either Lloyds or C&amp;G resulting from the transaction.
Lloyds is also putting aside additional cash resources of up to #25m
for a cash payment to be made to many widows and other bereaved joint
account holders. New legislation has been proposed to allow these
payments to be made as under current legislation they would not be
permitted.
The #1800m will come from Lloyds Bank's own resources and will be
distributed to eligible C&amp;G members and depositors. The bank has no
plans to issue any equity over the purchase. C&amp;G has 230 branches though
only four in Scotland at Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.
Voting forms and transfer documents on the proposed takeover were
yesterday starting to be sent out by C&amp;G to its 806,000 eligible voting
investors and 384,000 eligible voting borrowers. Each transfer document
contains over 100 pages, and if all the documents were stacked on top of
each other they would reach twice as high as the Empire State Building.
If laid end to end, they would reach from London to Singapore -- and
back.
To be valid postal votes have to arrive back at C&amp;G no later than
midnight on Sunday, March 26, 1995. The special general meeting, where
members have to vote in person, takes place five days later, on Friday,
March 31, at the London Arena. If members vote in favour, and regulatory
approval is given, the date when C&amp;G will join the Lloyds Bank Group is
expected to be August 1, 1995.
For the deal to be approved at least half the Society's investing
members who are eligible to vote must vote in favour and at least 75% of
those who do actually vote must vote in favour. The borrowers resolution
is passed on a simple majority.
Following the proposed deal, Lloyds Bank and C&amp;G would have a combined
market share of the UK residential mortgage market of approximately 6.5%
(based on total combined residentail mortgages of #24.1bn at the end of
1994).
Lloyds said it believes that significant benefits can be gained by C&amp;G
joining the Lloyds Bank Group. In particular, it says that C&amp;G's
highly-successful specialist approach to its mortgage business will be
allied with Lloyds Bank's branch and other distribution strengths and
supported by Lloyds Bank's materially lower wholesale funding costs.
The bank argues that the substantially increased scale of the combined
businesses and the enlarged group's growth prospects are expected to
lead to further improvements in unit costs. However, judging by the fall
in its share price, the market may take some convincing over this.
It is intended that C&amp;G will continue to operate with substantial
autonomy, retaining its own identity and offering its own branded retail
savings and mortgage products. It will take over Lloyds Bank's
residential mortgage business using the C&amp;G brand on all products. C&amp;G's
chief executive Andrew Longhurst was at pains to stress yesterday that
C&amp;G chose Lloyds Bank, not the other way round.
Sir Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, commented: ''The
combined strengths of the C&amp;G and Lloyds Bank will significantly enhance
our competitive position. As a result the transaction will be good for
customers, staff and shareholders.''

IN the fickle world of international rugby, Jim Telfer, Ian Jardine,
and Damian Cronin know what a difference a week makes.
Last week, Telfer was given a list of role models for Scottish sport.
''Gavin Hastings' name was not on it,'' confided Scotland's director of
rugby. Yesterday, however, as Telfer held court while the Scottish team
was lauded at a Murrayfield forum on excellence in sport, Hastings' name
was on everyone's lips.
The names of Jardine and Cronin did not feature on the role-model list
last week either. But men who, in the line of duty, use the face to stop
an 18[1/2]-stone, 6ft 10ins lock, or give an arm for the cause, surely
have some credentials.
But both Jardine and Cronin will miss the remainder of the Five
Nations' campaign. Jardine already has undergone facial surgery. Cronin,
confirmed SRU secretary Bill Hogg last night, will return from his
French club, Bourges, later this week, to see whether an elbow-ligament
rupture must also go under the scalpel.
Both could otherwise have looked forward confidently to a recall
against Wales a week on Saturday.
Though Stirling's Jardine was discharged from Edinburgh City Hospital
yesterday, he had two plates inserted to repair a double fracture of a
cheekbone.
Hogg said the Stirling centre might restart training in three weeks:
''But that would be no physical contact whatever. It will be more like
six to eight weeks before Jardine is match-fit. That would see him ready
for the visit to Spain, and the World Cup in South Africa, if selected.
We are monitoring his progress.
''We can't yet be sure about Cronin. He is returning from France to
see if an operation is needed. Even if not, without a doubt, he will
miss the games against Wales and England.''
But the Scots can take comfort that their problems are insignificant
compared to those affecting Wales. Two props who began the season, two
recognised international full-backs, and the man billed as the world's
fastest winger, are all unavailable.
England, however, will not let World Cup thoughts intrude on the Five
Nations' decider against Scotland. ''To be credible World Cup candidates
you have to be top in Europe,'' said captain Will Carling.

Hearts 4, Rangers 2
DEFEAT could not be put down to the absence of Mark Hateley or Ally
McCoist, or any other player for that matter. Rangers lost because they
were prone to error, especially in defence and in goal, and Hearts won
through to the quarter-finals of the Tennents Scottish Cup because they
were tougher and more resilient.
The Tynecastle side emerged triumphant from a fourth-round tie which
was eventful if not brimming over with silky football. Still, six goals
in one game. That should be enough even for the most grudging of
critics.
Rangers have had to muddle through since the start of the season
asking players to perform in all manner of positions, and they would not
wish now to dwell too long on any the absences of any particular players
-- Basile Bolie also was unavailable last night -- especially since
their difficulties have not prevented them from dominating in the
premier division.
The law of averages alone suggested Hearts were due a break against a
team they had not beaten since August, 1991, and when the game began
with Craig Moore swiping Alan McLaren's backward header, which had
looped over the head of the advancing Ally Maxwell, that should have
been a sign of confirmation.
This was not going to be Rangers' night despite a mighty effort at the
start of the second half, which brought them back from the depths of
despair.
They had been dumped down there after 22 minutes when Colin Miller,
the former Rangers and Hamilton player, took a free kick awarded 22
yards from Maxwell's goal after Richard Gough had fouled another former
Ibrox employee, David Hagen.
Miller's low shot was not the most powerful yet it beat the keeper at
his right-hand post, the ball clipping the wood as it entered the net.
Maxwell was slow in reacting, and in fact dropped like a cadaver.
There was no life or urgency about his attempt to prevent Rangers from
falling behind, and he was more obviously suspect when Dave McPherson,
who has moved between Ibrox and Tynecastle like someone unable to make
up his mind where to reside, headed in the second goal during time added
on to the first half.
Gough played the ball back to Maxwell, who had time and space enough
to place his clearance, but he decided to dribble the ball a few yards
instead. Then, for a reason known only to himself, he picked the ball up
and conceded a free kick, which led to a corner for Hearts on their
left.
Jim Bett lofted the ball over, the ball was headed, by Moore it
seemed, towards his own goal, and McPherson lunged at the ball and
headed into the net.
Rangers seemed determined to get the ball rolling again, and were back
out for the second half a few minutes before Hearts reappeared, but a
minute later Brian Laudrup had the ball in the net. Charlie Miller
played the ball to Gough, who had advanced to the edge of Hearts' box,
and his cross was met perfectly by Gordon Durie.
The striker's header beat Craig Nelson's dive and appeared to be
sailing into the net, but Laudrup stretched out a leg and made
absolutely certain.
Rangers were given hope and two minutes later they were level. Alex
Cleland pushed the ball to Miller on the right, and his cross to the far
post again was met by Durie, but this time he didn't need assistance as
his header evaded Nelson's outstretched arm.
At that point most people would have expected Rangers to go on and
finish the tie as Hearts looked dejected at having surrendered their
lead, but they were given a break just when they needed one. In 58
minutes Bett's shot was parried by Maxwell, and John Robertson was able
to slide the loose ball into the empty net, sending his team's
supporters into delirium for the third time.
Both sides made changes before in the time remaining, with Rangers
taking off Robertson, who was injured, and sending on Ian Durrant, but
the significant switch was made by Hearts, who took off their own
Robertson and gave his place to Kevin Thomas.
The substitute scored two minutes from time after McPherson had gone
on one of those loping runs of his.
Eventually and just when it looked as though he had run himself into
trouble he released the ball to Thomas, who finished the contest with a
low shot.
If Hearts, who had one player, Bett, booked, are looking for omens
they will be delighted to recall that the last two times they met
Rangers at Tynecastle in the cup -- 1968 and again in '86 -- they won
both and went all the way to the final on both occasions.
They now meet Dundee United at Tynecastle in the quarter-finals, and
it would be unwise to bet against them moving closer to another final.
As for Rangers, they can now concentrate exclusively on winning their
seventh successive premier-division championship by a record margin, yet
this season will still be their worst in five years simply because they
can win only one trophy. Victims of their own success, and Hearts, of
course.
HEARTS -- Nelson, Frail, Miller, Levein, Bett, McPherson, Hamilton,
Mackay, Robertson, Millar, Hagen. Substitutes -- Colquhoun, Thomas,
Smith.
RANGERS -- Maxwell, Moore, Robertson, Gough, McLaren, Cleland, Steven,
McCall, Miller, Durie, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Brown, Durrant, Thomson.
Referee -- W Young (Clarkston).

WILLIAM Hill, one of the country's leading bookmakers, now have
radically changed their cup odds following Rangers exit from the
tournament.
Old Firm rivals Celtic have now become 6-4 favourites for the Scottish
Cup, while Hearts find themselves on the 9-2 mark to land the trophy.
Hearts' Edinburgh rivals, Hibs, are second best at 11-4, with holders
Dundee United 13-2.
But if you fancy a real shock -- with the second-division giantkillers
Stenhousemuir -- the latest betting with Hills on their chances is
100-1.

RANGERS left Edinburgh last night amidst nagging rumours that striker
Mark Hateley may be out for the rest of the season.
Hateley did not appear last night, and afterwards Ibrox manager Walter
Smith confirmed that he was not one of the men who had been suffering
from a virus beforehand.
Smith would not go further, but I understand that Hateley is troubled
with a pelvic injury and there are doubts about his fitness for the
remainder of this season.
It would be a cruel blow for the champions, coming as it did in the
wake of further controversial refereeing decisions last night.
They had a penalty claim turned down just before half-time, moments
after Hearts had swept into a two-goal lead, but manager Walter Smith
made no excuses.
He said simply: ''Obviously we are very disappointed, but when you
lose goals the way we did tonight then you cannot expect a lot from a
game.
''We did well to get back to 2-2, but when Hearts scored a third it
was always gong to be a struggle to make another comeback.''
Hearts now march on to a quarter-final clash at home against the
holders, Dundee United.
Manager Tommy McLean said: ''Our game has been knocked from pillar to
post but tonight, with so many people watching, this was a tremendous
advert for our football.
''I think it tells us all something. When you are playing a cup-tie
with two teams that are prepared to attack then you get a good game. The
fear factor which exists in the premier league is not there.
''If you go back to a league of 16 then you will help eliminate that
attitude. The fear factor is what is spoiling the game as a spectacle.
''I was worried when they got back level after half-time and will be
asking questions about that. It's something that we have to examine.
There is still work to be done.
''But the main thing is we are in the quarter-finals. We have a home
tie and we can't ask for more.
''I asked a few questions of my players beforehand but they answered
them alright.''
The tie against United could be another live television match, and
McLean suggested it could have a Sunday kick-off and be all-ticket.
* MORTON defender Peter Cormack was rushed to hospital last night with
a broken leg.
Cormack received the injury in an accidental clash with Dumbarton's
Bobby McConville during a Reserve League West match which ended 2-2.
Manager Alan McGraw confirmed later: ''The leg is definitely broken
and he is now in plaster.''
* JUVENTUS striker Roberto Baggio, out of action for three months
because of injury, will not be fit to return to action next weekend as
he had hoped.
Baggio had pencilled in Sunday's league match with Sampdoria for his
comeback, but said yesterday that he had been too optimistic.
The former European footballer of the year is now aiming to be fit for
the game away to Inter-Milan on March 5.

DUNCAN Shearer revealed yesterday that he was scared to leave his home
after the worst defeat in Aberdeen's history.
The striker owned up to his part in the shame at Stenhousemuir which
cost his club a place in the Scottish Cup quarter-finals. But he
believes it can spur the players in their fight for premier division
survival.
He admitted: ''Words cannot express how disgusted and ashamed I feel
about what has happened.
''I have been frightened to show my face outside my home since the
team returned. I was scared I'd run into some of our fans and get a
reminder of just how much that result at Ochilview really hurt them.
''How we could go from the highest point of the season -- beating
Rangers 2-0 -- to the lowest in the club's history within the space of
six days is just beyond belief.
''It is the players who have got the club into this position. It is up
to us to get it out of it.''
Caretaker manager Roy Aitken knows that the cup exit could prevent his
appointment on a permanent basis. He said: ''There are a couple of big
games approaching and the players want the chance to show they can match
the standards expected of them. Everyone must accept responsibility and
be more consistent.''
But the Dons will have to do it without defender John Inglis for the
next couple of weeks. He damaged a hamstring and joins captain Stewart
McKimmie, striker Scott Booth, midfielder Brian Grant, and full back
Colin Woodthorpe on the injury list.
Aberdeen will proceed with their plan to go public. The first move
towards the flotation will be made on March 13 and chairman Ian Donald
hopes it will raise around #3m.
* STENHOUSEMUIR will have to wait for the go-ahead from the local
police to play their quarter-final against Hibs at Ochilview.
'Muir will consider the possibility of erecting a temporary stand on
the grassed area behind one of the goals and using that to house the
Hibs fans.
* UEFA gave the clearest indication yesterday that Euro '96 would go
ahead in England -- without fences.
The shameful scenes in Dublin sparked fears that fans might have to be
caged in or the championships cancelled in England altogether.
Europe's governing body meet in Geneva next month to study reports
after England's game with Ireland was abandoned after 27 minutes because
of rioting fans.
But Ernie Walker, chairman of UEFA's stadia committee, tried to allay
those fears when he led a delegation at Liverpool's Anfield ground, one
of the venues earmarked.
Walker said: ''I can scarcely believe we would be here today if the
championships were not to go ahead in England. We cannot let one
incident spoil this. England is as well equipped to stage the
championships as any country.
''When it comes down to a question of policing, the police in England
are probably the most expert in handling supporters.''
Walker, the former SFA secretary, and his UEFA safety team were at
Anfield on the second stage of their journey assessing the progress of
stadia hosting the championship.
* FALKIRK manager Jim Jefferies learned the hard way that relegation
can be the price he must pay for a dogged determination to play the game
with style.
Having fallen through the trapdoor two seasons ago because he would
not betray his beliefs, Jefferies has come back more willing to
accommodate compromise.
''We all want to survive, and sometimes you have to adapt to the
premier-division style. It's all battling and fighting and running,'' he
said.
His Brockville side might be less than silky at Tannadice this evening
when they play Dundee United, who are down there with Falkirk in the
basement area.
It bothers Jefferies that he has not been able to rest Colin McDonald,
a young player who played well in the first half of the season but who
could do with a break.
Falkirk might have to play at Tannadice without Jamie McGowan, who is
doubtful because of injury, but Joe McLaughlin and Tommy McQueen ought
to be available again.
United manager Ivan Golac is expected to use Jerren Nixon from the
start against Falkirk and although goalkeeper Kelham O'Hanlon has
recovered from a thigh injury, Golac might be without Brian Welsh. The
defender has suffered a recurrence of a throat infection.

DISPLAYING all his skills and flair Adrian Maguire rode his 113th
winner of the season at Edinburgh yesterday to take the lead in the
jockeys' championship for the first time in the current campaign.
His only winner of the meeting, Ijab (6-1) in the Musselburgh Dash
Selling Handicap Hurdle, put him one ahead of Richard Dunwoody. The
reigning champion found himself idle on the first day after his 30 days'
suspension when Fontwell was abandoned after an early-morning
inspection.
Hot Punch and Ijab fought out a nail-biting finish from the last
flight, with Maguire, timing his challenge to perfection, getting his
mount home in the last few strides.
Trainer John Parkes said: ''No-one else but Adrian could have won. He
was brilliant. I thought we were beaten.'' It was Ijab's first win from
13 starts and Parkes admitted: ''He is no better than a selling
plater.''
Sparkling Flame (9-2), purchased privately from Nicky Henderson's
Lambourn yard in the summer, paid off handsomely for Airdrie potato
merchant Ronnie Bartlett in the Fife Hunt Club Hunter Chase.
Four years ago, when he won four races including the Mumm Club Chase
at Aintree, Sparkling Flame was regarded as one of the best staying
novice chasers in Britain.
Since then he has been out of form and Henderson decided a change of
scenery might do him good. ''I've hunted him a few times this winter and
it seems to have done the trick,'' said Bartlett, who had the useful
hunter chaser, Rawyards Brig.
He thinks it is too early to talk about the Foxhunter Chase at
Cheltenham but the possibility has not been ruled out.
Rapid Mover (13-2), who has been threatening to win at Edinburgh,
having finished second on two occasions earlier in the season, finally
came good for Donal Nolan by winning the Howgate Novices' Chase from
Maguire's mount, Juke Box Billy. It was the Wishaw trainer's first
success since Rapid Mover won at Hexham in May.
Classically-bred Kandyan put himself in line for a crack at some big
hurdling prizes with a smooth debut victory. Trainer Mark Tompkins is
contemplating the Triumph Hurdle and Aintree's Glenlivet Anniversary
Hurdle after the gelding justified his 700-mile round trip from
Newmarket.
The son of Shareef Dancer won the Mill Hill Juvenile Hurdle despite
drifting from 4-6 to 6-4.
Held up in the middle of the pack, he quickened readily when unleashed
by Dean Gallagher to defeat Fair And Fancy easily by three lengths.
Kandyan, formerly trained by Bill Watts and owned by Sheikh Mohammed,
was purchased for 17,000 guineas as a replacement for Blue Grotto, who
died at Newbury last October.
''We've been waiting for the good ground and that's why we brought him
up here,'' said Tompkins.
''If the ground is all right, he will go to Cheltenham but it might
that he will be better suited by Aintree.''

FREQUENTLY the faces of footballers are contorted to convey the same
hatred which drove the barbarians in Dublin last week, although the
game's players usually are parted with their sanity for different
reasons. If they lose touch with reason, it is because the combination
of a desire to win and to please pulls too strongly in the wrong
direction.
Fines and suspensions are handed out and we forgive. Often we do so
all too easily, because that is the way we are.
However, it is wrong, absolutely so, to reward loutish behaviour and
when Brian Martin leads the Scotland B squad out of the tunnel at Easter
Road tonight, the SFA will be condoning the Motherwell player's conduct
last time he was at Hibs' ground.
The association can't have forgotten -- it was only last Saturday,
after all, when Martin's team met Hibs in a Scottish Cup tie which
didn't go the Lanarkshire side's way. Hibs had just scored the second
goal of their 2-0 win when Martin remonstrated with a linesman and used
language foul enough to have himself dismissed.
Two days later Martin is awarded the captaincy of Craig Brown's shadow
squad for the friendly match against Northern Ireland.
It is a decision which should infuriate everyone who is already
sagging into despair under the weight of the dreadful problems which are
scarring the face of the beautiful game.
Last week, after fascists, racists, and xenophobes had rioted in
Dublin under football's banner, English internationalists spoke of their
horror and their disgust, but words are cheap.
When it comes to setting examples players are usually to be found
snarling and kicking. They either forget or brazenly throw away their
responsibilities. Too many of the rest of us are equally quick to
succumb to the seething passions of the football crowd and applaud
loudest the players who clench their fists and bare their teeth.
Perhaps we are too far gone, worn out, and our principles eroded and
weakened. The post-Thatcherite era is not a pleasant time and the
sporting arena no longer offers an escape. The thugs and the spivs, the
get-rich-quick kids who were encouraged to go for it, are taking what
they want and are making football their domain.
You can see them in the dear seats and also within the clubs because
there are people on the inside all too anxious to take more than their
fair share.
This is the time when to be a Vinny Jones is to be a hero and not an
embarrassment. This is also the time when administrators can openly
support a violent and unstable Frenchman, a player who is still
applauded despite his meanness of spirit.
The Border is no barrier to the deceit, the violence, or the malice
which engulfs our game and even though the cause might seem to have been
lost already, the least we can do is hold off this creeping malaise.
Can we not try to set a higher standard?
Craig Brown is a thoroughly decent man and Brian Martin is not a real
villain, but the former's decision to offer such a prestigious honour to
the latter, who faces suspension, suggests that we learned nothing from
the face of the small boy who stood afraid and bewildered before
rampaging hordes in an Irish football ground. There will be more James
Eagers, I fear.

CRAIG Brown, the Scotland team manager, sat in the splendid
surroundings of Dalmahoy yesterday and talked of the importance of
tonight's B international against Northern Ireland at Easter Road.
Brown insists that the fixture is vital to his plans for the future.
He sees it as an opportunity to assess players who have progressed
beyond under-21 level but have yet to reach the full squad.
For the players, he lays out the prospects which may await them. In
the immediate future there is Moscow and a European Championship clash
with Russia at the end of next month.
In the summer, there is the trip of what may yet be a shadow side to
Japan for a two-game tournament. And, in the distance, there is the
opportunity for some of these players to join the Scotland set-up on a
more regular basis.
For the first target Brown sees Brian Martin, Brian O'Neil, and Darren
Jackson as possible additions to his Moscow pool.
They were included in tonight's team which is -- Walker (Partick
Thistle), Wright (Aberdeen), McKinnon (Motherwell), Tweed (Hibs), Martin
(Motherwell), O'Neil (Celtic), Lambert (Motherwell), Rae (Millwall),
Brown (Kilmarnock), Jackson (Hibs), McGinlay (Hibs). Substitutes --
Woods (Motherwell), Dodds (Aberdeen), Cameron (Raith Rovers), McCart
(Motherwell), Hendry (Clydebank).
Brown said: ''Brian Martin will be captain. We're sure he will handle
that responsibility. Along with Darren Jackson he is a strong contender
for the game in Moscow. But Brian O'Neil is another who could be there.
''We are watching him very closely because he's pointing the way ahead
for us. The modern game demands that you build from the back. Since he
took over his new role at Celtic we have been impressed.''
Jackson is another who has forced the international manager to bring
him into the Scotland reckoning. Eleven goals at club level coupled with
a versatility which allows him to move between attack and midfield are
his major assets.
Brown looks towards Europe again as he points out: ''Many of the top
teams on the Continent are now using just one player up front with
another just sitting off him. Darren would be ideal in that role. He
would be perfect in it although here we will push him forward to join
Tom Brown.''
Brown's long-term planning, of course, extends beyond Moscow, and even
further than Japan. He is looking towards the closing games of this
European Championship bid, the games at Hampden when goals from
midfield, against Greece and Finland, could be crucial.
Alex Rae and Pat McGinlay were mentioned by Brown as potential scorers
from deep positions after he picked them yesterday.
Tonight may not possess the glamour which normally surrounds
international fixtures. But Brown hopes that the implications the game
has for him and his players can raise it above the common place.
Certainly the players have been given incentive enough to do that even
though, in Edinburgh yesterday, they must have realised that they were
only in a supporting role to the Scottish Cup clash at Tynecastle.

LINFORD Christie, jubilant at his world indoor 200 metres record, and
his fastest 60m, yesterday opened the door on a World Indoor
Championship appearance in Barcelona next month.
He is to review his plans after a chat with his coach, Ron Roddan, who
sees no problem if Christie has the appetite, for the demands of this
season are nothing compared to 1994. ''I always thought Linford had a
really good 200m in him indoors,'' said Roddan, ''but he still never
ceases to amaze me.''
Christie, who requires regular checks from a Munich specialist for a
chronic back problem, will decide on his return from Germany. His
concern is a flare-up of last year's hamstring injury which kept him out
for three weeks.
Whatever his decision, the championships promise to be high quality.
Entries confirmed yesterday include that of Kenya's world steeplechase
champion, Moses Kiptanui, who lowered his own world indoor 3000m record
last week, and Russia's Irina Privalova, who has equalled her world
indoor 60m record and broken the European 200m record this month.
Others committed to the championships include 35-time world pole vault
record man Sergey Bubka, decathlon world record holder Dan O'Brien, and
high jump world record holder Javier Sotomayor.

THE news that a supermarket chain is to pump #75,000 into British
basketball has been greeted with astonishment by Scottish officials --
for the money is earmarked for England, not Britain.
The Minister for Sport, Iain Sproat, was present at the launch of the
deal with Sainsbury's and their ''Classic Cola'' drink which also has
attracted #75,000 from the Government's Sportsmatch scheme.
The English Cup is included in the deal as is a start-a-team
initiative which will be part of a scheme to take advantage of the huge
interest in the promotion of three-on-three games, many of them
outdoors.
A travelling roadshow of coaches and players will visit more than 70
sports centres and schools throughout the country during the first year
of the scheme. But it appears that the ''country'' in this case is
England, not the whole of UK.
''We know nothing about the deal but it's not the first time that such
an announcement has been made -- it was the same when Budweiser
announced their sponsorship and claimed they were helping British
basketball when in fact it was only England,'' said Ken Johnston, the
Scottish Basketball Association's technical director.
''We pointed out their error but it made no difference -- they still
didn't come up with something for Scotland,'' he added.
Sainsbury's seem equally confused with their geography. Spokesman Bob
Cooper said: ''We were approached by the English Basketball Association
to support the development of basketball in the UK, and the programme
fitted our requirements perfectly -- investing in kids in the community,
a clean and a competitive sport, and an ambitious governing body.''
The last phrase has an ironic ring as far as the SBA is concerned for
it seems the EBA are now ready to take over Scotland.

THE United Nations and the International Olympic Committee yesterday
signed up to tackle sport's lesser-known drugs problem.
For once performance-enhancing steroids and hormone drugs took a back
seat as sportsmen went on the offensive against cocaine and heroin.
Footballers from three continents -- Roberto Baggio (Italy), Argentine
Abel Balbo, and Japan's Kazuyoshi Miura -- joined forces with
middle-distance runner Venuste Niyongabo (Burundi) and Michael Lynagh,
Australia's rugby XV captain, for an anti-drugs initiative promoted by
the IOC and the UN.
''A new alliance in the anti-drug battle could provide the
long-awaited turning point,'' said Giorgio Giacomelli, executive
director of the UN's International Drug Control Programme.
Giacomelli, who signed the agreement with IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch at a two-day conference in Rome, entitled Sport against Drugs,
said there were 40m drug-abusers worldwide.
The UN hopes that the support of the IOC and top athletes will help
steer vulnerable young people away from so-called recreational drugs.
The two organisations pledged to prevent drug abuse through the
promotion of a healthy lifestyle. They plan to set up a working group to
outline future co-operation.

ALAN Wells has condemned the pitch where England A won their opening
one-day international against Bangladesh in Dhaka yesterday. The captain
claimed it was unfit to stage the first official match between the
countries after the tourists swept to a 58-run success before a 10,000
crowd.
Wells, whose 96-run partnership with Jason Gallian steered England to
their match-winning total of 203 for eight from 50 overs, said: ''The
pitch was a disgrace. It crumbled and looked like plasticine.
''I thought a 160 total would win it, but in the end, Gallian saw us
well beyond that.'' The 23-year-old Lancashire batsman, who passed 50
for the fifth time on tour, was the cornerstone of England's innings,
scoring 58 from just 76 deliveries.
Wells hit 47, Paul Weekes was unbeaten on 36, and Richard Johnson
added 46 in eight overs to put the match beyond the home side's reach.
Dominic Cork, Johnson -- hitting form with the ball for the first time
on tour -- and Min Patel shared six wickets between them to restrict
Bangladesh to 145 for eight on 50 overs, but Ian Salisbury again had no
luck.
But Gallian was England's match-winner and Wells said: ''He has an old
head on young shoulders. I have rarely seen a young player adapt to so
many different conditions as Jason has so successfully on this tour.''
And Wells believes Gallian can progress to win full England honours.
''But I'd like to think I'm in the frame too,'' he said. ''As I've said,
I'm not here just to help the youngsters. I have England ambitions and
have rarely felt in better form than I am at the moment.
''I didn't score many championship runs last summer but my game has
matured over the past five years.''
England face Bangladesh in their second one-day international in Dhaka
tomorrow.

PROMOTER Frank Warren is ready to trade legal punches with Nigel Benn
for allegedly not co-operating in publicising Saturday's big London
Arena show.
Benn, now a non-resident and restricted to the time he can spend in
Britain, has so far attended no news conferences before his WBC
super-middleweight clash with dangerous American Gerald McClellan.
He did not show up at a conference scheduled for yesterday in central
London.
Warren says he will be issuing a writ for damages if he does not turn
up to face the media before the weekend.
The promotion, Warren insists, should have already been a 12,500 sell
out, but only a little over half that number of tickets have been sold.
* FRANK Bruno's 65-second wipe-out of Puerto Rico's Rodolfo Marin on
Saturday was watched by a prime-time ITV audience of 12.2m.
It was Bruno's first appearance on the commercial channel after being
screened by BBC during previous years, and it is anticipated that the
Shepton Mallet ''farce'' fight will finish in the top-10 sporting
viewing figures this year.

RICHARD Corsie and Alex Marshall produced a gritty performance to
claim a semi-final spot in the Churchill Insurance World Indoor pairs
championship in Preston last night by beating Welsh pair John Price and
Stephen Rees 7-5, 7-4, 4-7, 3-7, 7-4.
For the Scots, it was sweet revenge having lost to the Welsh pair at
the same stage of this event 12 months ago.
Price kept the Welsh pair in contention, particularly during the
second set, but with Rees finding his touch the Welsh pair levelled at
two sets each. Suddenly, the Welsh were calling the tune and when they
opened the decider with three shots on the first end Corsie and
Marshall's title hopes were on the line.
The Scots, however, responded superbly and picked up a maximum four on
the second end. A single on the next saw Price and Rees square at 4-4,
but a great next end from Corsie sealed the Scots victory.
In yesterday's second-round singles match, Tony Allcock, the winner
back in the 1986 and again the following year won 7-2, 7-2, 5-7, 2-7,
7-5 against South Africa's Neil Burkett.
Cumbernauld's Hugh Duff, the winner back in 1988, scraped through to
the quarter-finals when he snatched a last bowl win over Wynne Richards
last night.
Duff dropped the opening set 3-7, came from 2-6 down to take the
second 7-6, but lost the third 4-7. However, Duff squared when a fifth
end count of four gave him the next set 7-3 and he then raced to a 6-1
lead after five ends. Six bowls later, Duff faced a match-against
position after Richards counted a four and piled his next two bowls on
top of the jack.
Duff twice fired and missed, but his last bowl attempt was spot on and
he ditched the jack for the shot he needed to take the set 7-5.

THE Government is being urged by Highlands and Islands Enterprise to
maintain the ban on roadside development along the A9 Perth to Inverness
road to safeguard the rural communities the road by-passes.
The Scottish Office is currently reviewing the 20-year-old policy but
HIE chief executive, Mr Iain Robertson, argues that it has served well
the needs of both road users and by-passed communities.
''Considerable investment by agencies such as HIE has gone into
developing facilities in villages along the A9 to sustain communities
and attract passing trade. It has been a sensible and deliberate policy
not to encourage roadside service stations which, elsewhere in the UK,
act as a magnet for vehicles and passengers.
''However, these service areas do little for local communities, sited
as they are on out-of- town by-passes and motorways far removed from
local shops and other facilities. We want communities in places such as
Dalwhinnie, Newtonmore, and Kingussie to be the pulling power, with
income generated going into the pockets of local people and
businesses.''
Mr Robertson said motorists were already well served along the A9 with
good facilities. ''I believe this policy is particularly crucial as far
as the tourism industry in the north of Scotland is concerned.
''We want people to travel as widely as possible in our area and the
improvements to the A9 over recent years have substantially speeded up
the journey times between the Highlands and the rest of the UK.''
Visitors had to be encouraged to explore the villages in Badenoch and
Strathspey, even if they were heading further north. ''Roadside service
areas, away from these villages, would be a disincentive to explore.
Motorists would simply stop, fill up, and drive straight on,'' Mr
Robertson said.

ONE Scottish Commonwealth Games wrestler came back from Victoria last
year to find he had lost his job, other competitors have returned home
from international duty to discover their benefit stopped, and the
Scottish Sports Council revealed yesterday that a survey of Scottish
sportsmen showed many to be in debt to the tune of #5000, year on year.
''It is entirely wrong, and it has got to stop,'' said Allan Alstead,
chief executive of the SSC. ''We can't have people making such
sacrifices to represent their country.''
Alstead was speaking yesterday following a forum to launch the
council's strategy: ''Achieving excellence: Co-ordinated Action.''
Greater teamwork, partnerships between sports and new unitary
authorities, and politicising the sports agenda, are all essential to
halt a widely accepted decline in Scotland's sporting powers.
Scottish badminton director Allan Campbell, former Olympic coach in
Australia, points out his state budget Down Under was four times the
current Scottish one.
Nationalists applauded Jim Telfer, the Scottish Rugby Union's director
of coaching, who pointed out that rugby's high profile owes much to
Scotland competing against the world's best annually. Other sports, with
UK rather than Scottish world affiliations, are denied this.
There was vitriolic condemnation of Government failure to fund elite
sport, and the opinion from think-tank guru Dr Ian Thomson that it would
take at least, ''eight years of Labour Government'' to undo more than a
generation of Tory neglect.
But there also was criticism of governing bodies, who await hand-outs
without putting their creaking houses in order.
Thomson, former director of physical education at Stirling University,
provoked outrage and was branded ''demeaning'' when he exemplified
lacrosse as a sport condemned to sink if logical policies to avert
decline were applied.
Thomson believes that only the most efficient and successful Scottish
sports are worthy of more elite funding.
The SSC grant-aids 75 sports, of whom only 20 were present yesterday.
Thomson insisted: ''If we pour money into all of them, what chance have
we of promoting excellence? We must back sports which show real
potential. Lacrosse will just have to find its own level, and that's
hard luck.''
With almost all world-class competitors being full-time, a more
professional approach is essential. Even Telfer, from that bastion of
amateurism, agreed. ''Part-time professionalism,'' he said, ''is
inevitable in Scottish rugby. But full-time would be the death knell for
the club and district game. We don't have the money. Our best players
would disappear to England.''
As a former headmaster, he warned: ''I would never employ a top-class
rugby player in my school -- because he would never be there.''
For some sports there will be cuts in resources -- some budgets have
already been slashed. ''We will implement policies which bring the
maximum return. We will reinforce success,'' said Alstead, lapsing into
the jargon of his former role as a NATO brigadier. ''Just 15 governing
bodies already receive 80% of the council's annual grant-aid budget. But
we are not going to keep giving money to sports which are going
nowhere.''
Local authorities are the biggest spenders on sport facilities, and
Glasgow is a UK role model, with a quarter of the 200 sport development
posts in Scotland.
But other local authorities see elite sport as a distraction from mass
participation, building a swimming pool, for example,then charging clubs
#800 a session to use it.
These opposites highlight the problem facing the new unitary
authorities. Though statutorily obliged to provide ''adequately'' for
sport, the Scottish Office has not defined the meaning of ''adequate.''

Moscow, Monday,
THE head of Russia's paratroop forces vowed today to crush Chechnya's
separatists while Russian troops clashed sporadically with rebel
fighters on the outskirts of the devastated Chechen capital Grozny.
''Now that we have upset the hive, we have to catch all the bees,''
General Yevgeny Podkolzin told a news conference after the lapse of a
four-day ceasefire last night.
Podkolzin's remark underscored an increasingly harsh line among
Russian military and political officials after the shaky truce expired
at 6pm yesterday and talks on extending it collapsed.
An alternative voice came from Russia's human rights commissioner
Sergei Kovalyov, who told a parliamentary hearing that the big question
now for Moscow was the price it would have to pay for such a conflict.
President Boris Yeltsin sent troops into the North Caucasus territory
on December 11 to end a drive for independence launched by Chechen
leader Dzhokhar Dudayev in 1991.
The Russian government, despite the no-compromise tone from the
generals, has maintained it still favours working out a political
settlement.
But the Kremlin's call on Chechen forces to lay down their arms and
its strident condemnation of Dudayev as a criminal dictator have left
the Chechens with little room for manoeuvre.
Russian forces in Chechnya issued an appeal to the Chechen population
to shun those who had taken up arms against Moscow's men.
''Stop your sons and brothers, neighbours and others from senseless
bloodshed and recklessness. Don't allow armour to be stationed in your
homes, schools and hospitals,'' said the statement, carried by Itar-Tass
news agency.
Dudayev, for whom Moscow has issued an arrest warrant, told an
Estonian newspaper he had not expected weekend talks between military
officials from the two sides to produce results.
Russian forces, enjoying stronger firepower, drove most Chechen
fighters out of Grozny in early February after a fierce two-month battle
that left many buildings gutted.
The Chechens have now regrouped in other towns while keeping up
hit-and-run raids inside the capital.
Despite the lapse of the ceasefire, fighting appeared to be only
sporadic today.
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, who has been under fire in the liberal
press because of the high death toll and the destruction, continued to
defend the campaign.
Speaking at an army training base near Moscow, Grachev said 534
servicemen had been killed in the battle for Grozny which was
''insignificant, given the scale of the operation''.
The casualty figure was much lower than expert estimates and even that
issued by military authorities themselves.
Grachev said the operation was going according to plan but he had
ordered better armour and engines be fitted to the army's chief T-80
battle tank because the fighting in Chechnya had shown serious
shortcomings in its design.
Podkolzin, joining a growing list of top brass who have spoken of
basic strategic mistakes, accused the counter-intelligence services of
failing to provide accurate information when the campaign was being
planned.
Interfax news agency later quoted a Defence Ministry spokesman as
saying the ministry did not agree with Podkolzin.

* Economic problems forced Ukraine into the joint air defence system
it formed with other Commonwealth states earlier this month, the
commander of the former Soviet republic's anti-aircraft forces said
today.
''Already in the first years of independence, our anti-aircraft
defence system has run into serious problems, which are nearly
impossible to resolve considering the economic situation and isolation
from other Commonwealth countries,'' General Mykhailo Lopatyn told a
news conference.
Ukraine signed an agreement with most of the 11 other CIS members to
implement joint control over air space, inform each other about air
attacks and cooperate in fending off aggressors.
''The signatories of the agreement will get benefits like the use of
military research bases in Russia and Kazakhstan, and access to
technology and spare parts,'' he said.
''Once we start getting the equipment, we can push up battle-readiness
to 90-95% within three weeks,'' he said.
The Soviet Union's air defence system took 25 years to develop during
the Cold War and guard points encircled its borders. But the system
started crumbling when the communist monolith fell apart in late 1991.
Lopatyn said 40% of Ukraine's fighter aircraft were out of action
because of shortages of fuel and spare parts. Last year pilots only flew
a third as many practice flights as they had carried out during the
Soviet era.
The joint system in no way compromised Kiev's sovereignty, he said.
''Each state administers its own anti-aircraft forces independently.
They simply cooperate together.''--Reuter.

CHRIS Todd, one of the leading men's hockey umpires, in walking out of
the men's World Cup in Sydney last December when he was made a reserve
for the semi-finals, appeared to have set a trend among his colleagues.
Mike Graham, another Englishman, did a similar disappearing act on
Sunday morning when tournament director Peter Brown didn't appoint him
to one of the semi-finals in the Hamilton Rentals European Indoor Cup at
Meadowbank, claiming a ''clash of personalities''.
Todd and Graham are now both likely to have their names erased from
the appointments list, but future tournament organisers will now be
apprehensive about being landed with English officials.
On the brighter side of umpiring, the form of Jed Curran will please
Scottish officials.
For Curran this was his first international tournament appointment and
he excelled himself by not only being appointed to the semi-final
between Stockholm and Olten but he was also put in for the third place
match between Olten and St Albans.

EMMA Carrick-Anderson set herself up for this week's German national
championships in fine style by scoring her best ever international world
ranking result at the weekend.
The 19-year-old from Dunblane finished in ninth place at a Europa Cup
slalom held in Zakopane, Poland.
Starting No.28, she was fifteenth after the first run and then skiied
quickest, beating many of the established world cup stars including
sixth ranked Elfie Eder (Austria).
Emma made 11.4 FIS points, which indicates she could lower her world
ranking from 72 to 41. The field in Poland was boosted to world cup
level due to the cancellation of the world championships in Sierra
Nevada.
This is Carrick-Anderson's second top-10 Europa Cup result this year.
* AUSTRIA'S Mario Reiter snatched his first World Cup victory when he
beat Slovenia's Jure Kosir to win a giant slalom in Furano, Japan,
yesterday.
A solid first run and a sparkling second leg allowed the 24-year-old
Reiter to take his first World Cup win in a combined time of two minutes
38.92sec.
''I took all risks in the second run since I had nothing to lose after
finishing second in Sunday's slalom which was my first top three place
in the World Cup tour,'' Reiter said.
Reiter, second in the slalom behind his team-mate Michael Tritscher,
beat Kosir, one of the pre-race favourites, into second place on 2:39.03
with Norway's Harald Strand Nilsen third in 2:39.17.
''I skiied really well in the upper part of the course. The race was
very demanding,'' said the Austrian, nicknamed ''Super Mario''.
Kosir, who was the fastest in the first leg, was not too upset about
his second-place performance. ''It's the second time in a row that I
have finished among the top three in giant slalom. So I must be pleased
even if I came close to my first season's win.''

Brussels
ANY suggestion of a split among Labour's most senior figures over
plans to let a Scottish parliament vary income tax was rejected last
night by the Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson.
The point reportedly at issue among members of the Shadow Cabinet is
the commitment to give the parliament the power to raise or lower income
tax levels by up to 3p in the pound. This suggestion was dismissed as
nonsense by Mr Robertson, who said that the policy had been endorsed at
a meeting of the Scottish executive.
However, The Herald understands that although the party remains at
ease with the long-standing proposal for the parliament to have
tax-raising powers and will fight the next election with that policy
reconfirmed, disquiet is being expressed at the most senior levels about
the electoral consequences of offering a parliament with authority to
raise or lower income tax by 3%.
The party leadership is also concerned at the effect this extension of
tax-raising power would have in England, where there is growing
criticism of Labour's plan to set up regional assemblies. A senior party
source declined, when asked several times, to confirm that the
commitment to the 3p tax proposal in Scotland was ''set in stone''.
However, Mr Robertson insisted: ''There is no rethink, nothing going
on, the whole suggestion is preposterous.''
The party is also looking more deeply at the implications of giving
Scotland power to have, in effect, a different level of income tax from
the rest of the UK.
Labour's less committed devolutionists believe a lack of harmony in
tax-raising throughout the UK could backfire electorally, and even
damage the Union. Some also have doubts about its effect on investment.
Acute sensitivity to the debate is felt in the party leadership which
is determined not to be accused of reneging on a long-standing promise.
If Labour did admit the leadership was having second thoughts on this
issue it would be handing the Tories a bonus just when they most need
it.
Some observers believe the force behind Labour doubts extends no
further downwards in the party than Mr Tony Blair and, perhaps, Mr Jack
Straw. Mr Blair inherited the policy after it was steered through the
Scottish Constitutional Convention by Mr Donald Dewar in his days as
Shadow Scottish Secretary. When Mr John Smith became leader he warmly
embraced the Dewar model and was supported by other prominent Scots,
including Mr Robin Cook and Mr Gordon Brown.
Until this latest hint of new doubts emerged, the only indication that
the 3% plan was causing internal disquiet was a report last month of
moves to scrap some or all of the tax-raising proposal and have it
reconsidered.
An amendment proposed for the forthcoming Scottish conference by Mr
Jim Stevens, an economist at the Fraser of Allander Institute and
Scottish executive member, sought to reverse the ''right of the Scottish
parliament to vary levels of taxation within agreed parameters''.
Mr Robertson said later that he did not believe this idea was gaining
ground. ''I do not envisage it being changed,'' he said.
Mr Pat McFadden of Mr Blair's office later attacked the report in The
Herald as inaccurate and misleading. He did not deny, however, that the
policy was being challenged inside the party.

NOW that the seven tournaments which comprise the Arizona, California,
and Hawaiian segment of the US Tour have been completed the caravan
moves east across the continent for the six tournaments which form the
approach to the season's first major championship, the Masters -- and
they are the only remaining opportunities for a European player to add
his name to a very short list.
To do so he must win one of the five events in Florida or the one in
New Orleans to join the nine other European professionals (and the
Amateur Champion, Lee James) in the starting field at Augusta in April.
Since that number is customarily around 90, the percentage of places
does not exactly err on the high side.
Moreover, six of the nine, as past winners of the title, are
automatically invited -- Severiano Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Sandy
Lyle, Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam, and the holder, Jose Maria Olazabal. The
odd men out, as it were, are Colin Montgomerie, winner of last season's
order of merit, and Miguel Angel Jiminez and David Gilford, fifth and
seventh respectively.
This is a reduction of three from last year, when membership of the
1993 European Ryder Cup team brought invitations to Sam Torrance,
Costantino Rocca, Peter Baker, Barry Lane, Olazabal, and Montgomerie,
who also had won the order of merit for the first time, Anders Forsbrand
and, of course, the then five past champions, were invited, too.
In effect, therefore, only three European players have been invited to
play, hardly a reflection of the strength of their tour as expressed
particularly in the closeness of the results of the last six encounters
with the United States, the successes of Nick Faldo in the Open
Championship, and the close calls experienced by him and Montgomerie in
the US Open.
A professional, who is not an American, was once asked which of the
four majors might be the ''easiest'' to win. To which he replied: ''The
Masters, if only I could get into it.'' Increasingly, this tournament,
for a long time regarded as the organisational example others should
follow, has been overtaken by events.
The Masters, indeed, seems to have become trapped in a time-warp,
dating back almost to its inauguration in 1934, when the immortal Bobby
Jones, altough by then retired from competition himself, invited his
contemporaries to enjoy the Georgia spring weather and play
''garden-party'' golf over the course he and Alister Mackenzie had
designed.
Matters have become more real and earnest since. The field of fewer
than 100, compared with upwards of 150 in the three other championships,
generally consists of some 20 who, as amateurs or ageing former
champions, have no chance of winning and another score or so of
journeymen professionals only marginally less disadvantaged.
Expanding the field to 100 would start the movement towards a greatly
improved, more international, and fairer level of participation. The
number of amateurs has sensibly been restricted to four and no harm
would be done, with the possible exception to tradition and nostalgia,
if an age limit were to be imposed on former champions.
Just as the Royal and Ancient Club has resisted granting too many
exemptions into the Open Championship for performances in individual
tournaments, the Augusta National Club should stop giving places to the
winners of regular US Tour events in favour of making greater use of the
three principal rankings -- the world, US, and European lists.
A starting basis would be the first 40 in the world list (there would
certainly be duplications), the first 20 in the American equivalent, and
at least 10 places from Europe. That number would be augmented by rather
fewer qualifiers from the Australian, Japanese, South African, and Asian
tours. That would eliminate the criticism that the Masters is only ''an
American major.''
Lastly, as the sponsors of the tournament, Augusta National would have
a number of other invitations at their disposal. One advantage of that
dispensation would be the avoidance of the embarrassment caused in 1992,
when no place, under the existing qualification list for American
players, could be found for Tom Kite.
A tendency towards isolationism is never far from American golf
thinking. But the USGA and the USPGA have in recent years relaxed
considerably their previous restrictions on overseas professionals and
this welcome, not to say inevitable, development should now be extended
through the patrician portals of the Augusta National Club.

WHILST there are players of considerable experience and physique
waiting in the wings for a selectorial call to arms, it is disappointing
that Scotland's midfield trio will have to be altered following the
wretched luck experienced by Ian Jardine in the closing spell of the
Paris international.
Whoever does step forward to take his place will need to be on his
mettle to match Jardine's contribution against France.
The Craig Chalmers-Jardine-Gregor Townsend axis has not been
everyone's cup of tea because each has been striving for form and,
Townsend apart, there is a shortage of that electric acceleratory pace
that sometimes represents the difference between a breach and a block.
Yet having been subjected to much flak following the Canada and Ireland
Tests those three won over many detractors with their play against
France.
It is frequently a danger that selectors refrain from changing a
winning side when it could and should be strengthened. That applies,
especially, to a team that has placed its mark on history. There would
be, however, general agreement that the C-J-T trio should have been
given another opportunity of consolidating their partnership. True, they
might have been posed a tougher examination had the French switched to a
subdue-and-penetrate format by using their big forwards more as the
initial tank squadron. Having said that, it was one of the admirable
features in Scotland's effort that all three midfield men took a full
role in the magnificent defence effort. Jardine is renowned as a torpedo
man, Chalmers seldom can have put in so many important sinkings, and
Townsend's acceleratory advantage permits opponents only minimal time on
the ball. There will be close study of the defence frailty that conceded
two soft tries, but those apart Scotland's copybook tackling, aimed at
pinning legs together, gives every reason for confidence against Wales.
Jardine had a mixture of luck and misfortune. His cheekbone injury was
a sad blow to a player of dogged courage as well as to Stirling County's
prospects in the crucial game against Boroughmuir at Bridgehaugh on
Saturday. But the wrestling-type lift and dump to which Jardine was
subjected by Abdelatif Benazzi might have been much more serious.
It really is high time that the legislators outlawed as an ordering
off offence the practice of pulling a player's legs off the ground and
upwards then crashing him downwards. Why should it be regarded as
dangerous when a player who jumps up for the ball has his legs taken
away or a prop is hung up to dry in a scrummage yet no action is taken
to prevent the kind of danger to which Jardine was subjected?
Meanwhile, step forward Tony Stanger, Scott Hastings, or Graham Shiel.
The last named is a second five-eighth type with an educated boot and
snappy hands, but one of the heavier players would be more suited to the
Jardine-type role which he filled so effectively in Paris by setting
targets to which his forwards could advance. Only once do I recall the
Scots failing to recycle ball that Jardine had taken forward. Stanger
seems the front-runner as a dependable footballer with ideal midfield
physique and safe hands, but Hastings, with 50 centre appearances, is
accustomed to the angles and has a reputation appreciated even by
Australian coach Bob Dwyer.
By a very short head I would play Hastings on the grounds of his wider
experience in a very important match. But whoever receives the call
should enjoy a decent share of the handling action. In Paris, Chalmers
received 31 balls, kicked 12 and passed 19. And those outside showed
that they have more in their armoury than just the ability to chase and
to knock folk over and Townsend's threatening kick off a standing start
is a godsend.
Incidentally, there always is some amusement in seeing Scottish
players at practice running up and down, each handling the ball behind
his back and all round his body, first to one side then the other. Yet
Townsend's brilliance in offering ball behind his back and with the one
hand inverted was just another form of that practice drill. And it
launched his captain into rugby's annals.

KEITH Knox, the former ABA flyweight champion from Bonnyrigg, last
night kept his unbeaten professional record intact -- but only just. He
boxed a draw over six rounds against Lyndon Kershaw, of Halifax.
Professional featherweight debutants from Coatbridge got off to
winning starts. Robert Hay floored Sheffield's Mohammed Shaffique three
times before the referee called a halt halfway through the second round,
and Paul Watson looked so impressive in stopping Paul Goode, of Halifax,
who sustained a nasty cut above an eye during the first round.
At super-middle, Ray Webb, of Stepney, outpointed Craig Joseph, of
Bradford, over six rounds.

NAHTHEN Lad can make a successful first venture outside novice company
by winning the Grade Two Regency Hurdle at Warwick.
Jenny Pitman's six-year-old was reported to be the best novice hurdler
in Weathercock House at the start of the season. He appears to be
Cheltenham quality but he may miss the Festival next month, as
connections fear that a hard race could ruin his exciting future.
Nahthen Lad ran green when getting off to a winning start over timber
at Towcester on his reappearance, and he needed to be driven out to beat
Solo Gent by a length.
He confirmed the promise of that effort on his subsequent starts, and
indeed is now on the verge of a hat trick after victories at Haydock and
Huntingdon.
On the former occasion he ran on strongly to deny Rosmarino by
half-a-length, while last time out he had two-and-a-half lengths to
spare over Deduce in the valuable Sidney Banks Memorial Novices' Hurdle.
Conditions here at Warwick -- an extended two-and-a-half miles in
heavy ground -- will prove very much to Nahthen Lad's liking, and he
should be capable of extending his winning run.
Martin Pipe's Allegation, due to be ridden by returning champion
Richard Dunwoody, was in fine form prior to a disappointing effort in
the Grade Three Sandown Handicap Hurdle last time, and he would rate as
a major threat if he can put that poor run behind him.
Inclement weather put paid to Adrian Maguire's hopes of building up a
lead over Dunwoody in the race for the jockeys' title while his rival
was sitting out a suspension, but the young pretender has good prospects
of a double today aboard Brownhall and Putty Road.
David Nicholson's Brownhall looked a very useful chasing prospect
towards the end of last year. He notched up a hat trick of victories,
culminating in the Tripleprint Feltham Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day,
when he beat Mad Thyme by 20 lengths.
He disappointed when odds-on for a novice event at Ascot last time
out, finishing a well-beaten fourth -- almost 30 lengths behind the
winner, Brave Highlander.
However, he had shown sufficient promise prior to Ascot to warrant
another chance in the Beauchamp Novices' Chase.
Half-an-hour later the same stable's Putty Road can win the Coventry
City Novices' Trial Hurdle.
The five-year-old, who is making his British debut, has shown himself
to be a very promising hurdler for Aidan O'Brien in Ireland, winning
novice hurdles at Tralee and Leopardstown. He is sure to continue
improving and can begin to justify his price tag.
A QUARTER of an inch of rain at Carlisle has forced the abandonment of
today's meeting.
The decision was made at about 4pm yesterday by the Stewards after it
became clear that the track would not drain in time.
Clerk of the course Johnny Fenwick-Clennell said: ''There is casual
water on the track and there was no alternative but to call off the
meeting now.''

THOSE who have refused to acknowledge the depth of corruption that
exists in American collegiate sport have finally had the hard evidence
thrown in their faces.
Ohio State University recently suspended one of their coaches after he
was found to have contravened regulations that prohibit the giving of
gifts and other benefits to college athletes.
Such practices have often been unearthed in football and basketball.
This time the sport was synchronised swimming.
* WITH the 1996 Olympics galloping towards us, Olympic fever is
beginning to take hold in the USA. Almost daily there are updates in the
press on the progress, or lack thereof, being made in the host city of
Atlanta.
Overshadowing interest in participants and facilites, though, appears
to be the peripheral issues such as what will become the next
''official'' Olympic anything and how much it will cost.
Most recently, interest has centred on the debate over what the
Atlanta Olympic motto will be, the phrase that will be uttered
incessantly until the Games begin and forgotten instantly thereafter.
None the less, two of the most popular contenders seem unlikely to earn
selection.
The first is: ''Atlanta, an island in a sea of rednecks.'' And the
second: ''Atlanta, at least we are not Birmingham.'' Nobody explained if
they mean the Birmingham in Alabama or the real one.
Sidelined celebrity
THE folks in South Dakota are used to hardship. Severe winters lasting
four months and longer are commonplace, and the rugged landscape
produces a breed of people of great fortitude.
They are also used to not being in the spotlight of professional sport
in the way, for example, that nearby Minnesota might be. So, when one of
their own makes it into the big time it's cause for celebration.
And celebration was rampant when basketball player Eric Piatkowski was
signed by the Los Angeles Clippers. People were so enthused that
Piatkowski was named South Dakota celebrity of 1994. That award
encompasses more than just sport; the award can go to a celebrity of any
kind.
And Piatkowski may even win the award for 1995. If things go well,
this season the Clippers may actually allow him to play in one of the
games.
* TEN years ago, Ron Davis was a relief pitcher for the Minnesota
Twins. Fans of the Twins felt greatest relief, though, when Davis
retired. He had a habit of allowing his opponents to score late-game
home runs which often altered the outcome. Even now, the fans still
remember as Davis recounts.
''When it's 10 years later and they still hate you, that's what you
call charisma.''
Off street toot suite
THOSE of you looking for ideas on how to land the job of your dreams
could learn a thing or two from Brad Bergoine.
Prior to this year's Super Bowl he was the marketing manager for a
dry-cleaning company. But that simply was not the field in which he
wanted to work.
So, as the traffic began to roll toward the match in Miami's Joe
Robbie Stadium, Bergoine stood at the roadside wearing a sandwich board
which read: ''Wanted: marketing position with winning team. Honk for
resume.''
Several people did, including singer Tony Bennett, who performed at
the half-time show. Bergoine handed out over 500 CVs and, within two
weeks, he was appointed marketing manager of Boca Raton Magazine.
''I thought 'Honk if you want a resume' was very creative,'' commented
John Shuff, Bergoine's new boss. ''There he was dodging traffic like
bullets and I thought, 'That kid knows how to hustle'.''
* SOMETIMES meanings can get lost in the translation. Something like
that seems to have happened when a rumour spread recently that star high
school American football player, Chauncey McGee, had committed suicide.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigated the story which was
especially newsworthy given that the college recruiting season was at
its height.
''Chauncey didn't commit suicide,'' the paper reported. ''Chauncey
committed to Mississippi State.''

UEFA gave the clearest indication yesterday that Euro '96 would go
ahead in England -- without fences.
The shameful scenes in Dublin sparked fears that at best, fans might
have to be caged in, at worst the championships would be scrapped in
England altogether.
Europe's governing body meet in Geneva next month to study reports
after England's game with Ireland was abandoned after 27 minutes because
of rioting fans.
But Ernie Walker, chairman of UEFA's stadia committee, tried to allay
those fears when he led a delegation at Liverpool's Anfield ground.
Anfield is one of the venues earmarked for the championships and
Walker said: ''I can scarcely believe we would be here today if the
championships were not to go ahead in England.'' He added: ''We cannot
let one incident spoil this. England is as well equipped to stage the
championships as any country. There might be places in the world where
fencing is needed -- but not here.
''England has the best grounds in the world, pound for pound, city for
city.
''There will be, of course, normal segregation of fans but not with
fences.
''The best stadia are here and that did not prevail a few years ago.
We must take advantage of that.
''When it comes down to a question of policing, the police in England
are probably the most expert in handling supporters.'' Walker, the
former Scotland Football Association secretary, and his UEFA safety team
were at Anfield on the second stage of their journey assessing the
progress of the stadiums hosting the championship matches.
The delegation were at Newcastle yesterday and will visit Manchester
United tomorrow morning and Leeds in the afternoon.''

JIM Jefferies has been acquainted with pressure all his managerial
career, but familiarity doesn't make his life any easier. Every time he
sends a team out to play he worries.
He worries about the possibility of losing more points and he worries
about the quality of his team's play. In fact, if the truth be told
Jefferies, whose philosophy is based on style and entertaining, frets
more about Falkirk's look, their approach to some of the matches.
Even when they have won, the manager's enjoyment has been diluted by
the manner in which the triumph was achieved and it pains him that
sometimes he has had to adapt and distance himself from the way he wants
to see his team play. He learned the hard way that relegation can be the
price a manager must pay for a dogged determination to play the game
with style.
It says much about Scottish football that panache can be punished so
harshly, but having fallen through the trapdoor two seasons ago because
he would not betray his beliefs Jefferies has come back more willing to
accommodate compromise. ''There have been times this season when we have
won and I was left less than enamoured with the way in which we
collected the points,'' he said.
''But we all want to survive, and sometimes you have to adapt to the
premier-division style. It's all battling and fighting and running.''
And not at all what Jefferies wants to witness, but needs must and his
Brockville side might be less than silky at Tannadice this evening when
they play Dundee United, who are also down there with Falkirk in the
basement area. In fact, Falkirk are on 27 points, only one in front of
United who have a game in hand. Four points further back are Partick
Thistle and beyond them nothing, only the log drop into the place below.
''When faced with that prospect then you must sometimes abandon any
cavalier approach you might like to see all the time and that in itself
can be difficult to do. However, if you want to use players who are
capable of playing and also of rolling up their sleeves you first need
money to buy them, and the players who can do both cost a lot of
money,'' he said.
It also bothers Jefferies that he has not been able to rest Colin
McDonald, a young player who played well in the first half of the season
but who could do with a break. However, injury and suspension usually
take a toll at this stage of most campaigns and clubs like Falkirk find
their resources stretched which means every available body has to be
pressed into action.
Falkirk's form in the first half of the premier-division programme was
impressive and Jefferies puts that down to the fact that he had most of
his influential players available, but suspensions have been denying him
the services of several influential players since the turn of the year
and form has dipped.
''Also, while I'm not against three points for a win I would question
its validity in a 10-club division,'' he said. ''The points system
brings its own pressures because one week you can find yourself
challenging for a European place and a couple of weeks later be involved
in relegation trouble.
''It is all so tight. Look at Kilmarnock, who were in trouble but are
now in with a chance of getting a European place while we had a good
first half of the season and now find ourselves down the division.
In fact, having been in fourth place at the half way stage it would
not have been unreasonable of us if we had felt reasonably secure, but
it doesn't work that way with three points for a win.
''However, if we win then we would move on to the same points total as
Kilmarnock, but there would still be a pressure and you can sense it
among players when you are working with them every day. Still, they are
professionals and they have to live with whatever the system brings.''
Falkirk, who were idle last Saturday while Tennents Scottish Cup
fourth-round ties took place, might have to play at Tannadice without
Jamie McGowan, who is doubtful because of injury, but McLaughlin and
Tommy McQueen ought to be available again.
United may be in a precarious position but their manager, Ivan Golac,
isn't even contemplating relegation. Looking at tonight's match and the
next one, against Partick Thistle on Saturday, he said: ''These games
are important but only because they can help push us up into second top
place in the table and allow us to qualify for Europe on our league
position.''
Only Golac could say something like that.
He is expected to use Jerren Nixon from the start against Falkirk and
although goalkeeper Kelham O'Hanlon has recovered from a thigh injury
Golac might be without Brian Welsh. The defender has suffered a
recurrence of a throat infection.

AT the very frontiers of medicine is the Nuffield's Assisted
Conception Service, which has been operating for around 10 years. This
is run in partnership with the University Department of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology and the unit is staffed by five consultants specialising in
infertility.
It offers services such as invitro fertilisation, induction of
ovulation, embryo freezing, investigation of male infertility, and
artificial insemination.
But ''the counselling, hand-holding and sheer up-front honesty so
necessary in this sensitive area are also major pluses at the
Nuffield'', according to one former patient. Success rate is around 28%
and a profusion of photographs of the Nuffield's bouncing successes are
in evidence in the ACS unit which has a suitably cosy and unintimidating
atmosphere.
Many of the Nuffield's assisted conception service patients seek
treatment in desperation as they may not be eligible for NHS treatment
simply because sheer pressure of numbers necessitates a much stricter
cut-off point in the public sector.
The Nuffield will take older women (up to menopause, if this is
medically advisable) and, says hospital manager Retta Deerin ''the fact
that this facility is running here means that NHS patients also
benefit''. There is in fact a surprising amount of cross-pollination
between the hospitals and The Nuffield is accredited for undergraduate
and post registration nurse training.

MANY more people are now turning to private health care as an
alternative to NHS treatments. Waiting lists at private hospitals are
practically non-existent and patients can normally fix their own dates
of admission to fit in with personal, business or holiday plans.
Efficiency is the keynote, and with the development of sophisticated
non-invasive diagnostic equipment, diagnosis can rapidly be followed up
by appropriate treatment.
The old image of the private sector hospital as a ''nursing home'', ie
eventide home, has gone, and Glasgow's private hospitals are now
recognised as modern, acute care hospitals offering facilities for most
diagnostic and treatment procedures.
Hospital accommodation is of hotel standard. Private rooms with
en-suite facilities are all provided with telephone, radio and
television, and the general atmosphere in all departments is softer,
warmer and consequently much less frightening than in many large NHS
hospitals. Private health care means much more personal attention, and
often a greater sensitivity. You don't feel like a number or an object
on a conveyor belt.
There has been much more resistance to the idea of private health care
in Scotland than south of the Border, but this is changing, as are the
sorts of people who decide to opt for it.
Many people fear for the future of the NHS and are taking out medical
insurance to cover hospital treatment for themselves and their families,
while some employers offer insurance as part of a work package.
''Speed is the essence here,'' says Nuffield Hospital manager Retta
Deerin, ''but that's not to be confused with NHS queue-jumping. You are
simply buying a service and you are in fact lessening the queue for NHS
patients. And it is simply not true that consultants use NHS time in
private hospitals.''
The majority of patients at Glasgow's private hospitals (the Nuffield,
Bon Secours and Ross Hall) are insured, but for that proportion who are
not covered, or for those who find that cover is not quite what they
imagined it to be (it's a good idea to examine the small print in
advance) all three offer a selection of fixed-price packages.
These all-inclusive packages -- only personal items such as telephone
and newspapers are excluded -- mean that patients will know in advance,
exactly what they will have to pay for their treatment and
accommodation, and so be free from the financial uncertainties of
open-ended agreements.
Certain conditions have to be met at each hospital and patients will
also be expected to pay the cost in full prior to admission, but they
will not have to worry about additional charges, even if extra days in
hospital are required.
The Glasgow Nuffield Hospital's ''fixed price surgery'' covers a wide
range of surgical procedures in all the major medical specialities such
as hip-replacement, cataract removal and varicose vein surgery. GPs will
normally refer patients to a consultant who participates in the scheme,
and who will assess their suitability. Bon Secours Hospital's ''fixed
price care'' also covers a wide array of surgical procedures, including
plastic surgery, and there are medical packages too.
The largest of Glasgow's private hospitals is Ross Hall which is part
of the American private healthcare group, BMI (formerly AMI). Bon
Secours Hospital is the oldest private hospital in the city and was
founded by the Sisters of Bon Secours de Paris, though welcomes patients
from all or no religious denominations. It is totally financially
independent and is run as a non-profit-making organisation with
charitable status, all revenue being re-invested in future expansion of
medical treatment facilities for the long-term benefit of patients.
The Nuffield (smallest in Glasgow with 43 beds) is one of 33 hospitals
of the largest wholly owned British private hospital group in the UK,
and it operates as a working charitable trust, all profits being
similarly ploughed back into improving patient facilities.
These are extremely impressive, and the Nuffield has recently become
one of Britain's most advanced imaging centres with the introduction
last September of the Siemens 1.5 Tesla Vision Scanner. Magnetic
resonance imaging is a way of looking inside the body without using
harmful X-rays. It produces pictures of such remarkable precision that
doctors can get as much information as from looking directly at the
tissue, thus enabling early detection and treatment of disease.
Multiple sclerosis can be identified in its early stages using MRI,
tumours can be distinguished from surrounding tissue and disease in the
base of the brain and interior of the spine can be easily examined. Torn
ligaments, knee cartilages and other joint damage can also be assessed
and the scanner (which is also available for the use of NHS patients)
can produce both two and three-dimensional images.
Ross Hall has a 20-bed cardiothoracic suite and fully equipped
intensive care unit -- the Nuffield can provide intensive care for one
bed and Bon Secours has a high dependency unit -- and also offers
treatment of shortsightedness and astigmatism at its Scottish Corneal
Laser Centre. The introduction of pulsed dye laser treatment benefits
many patients with unsightly skin blemishes such as strawberry
haemangiomas and port wine stains.
Ross Hall also supports a team dedicated to the management of sports
injuries, and the hospital's Sports Medical Centre located in the
physiotherapy department uses an array of highly specialised equipment
for the treatment of sporting related injuries. Apart from accurate
assessment and diagnosis of sports injuries followed by appropriate
treatment (leading to an early and safe return to the particular sport)
the centre also advises on how to minimise the risk of further injury.
Health-screening is now an important feature in the private sector and
all the hospitals mentioned offer services such as mammography, cervical
smear testing, heart checks, and general health screening tailored to
individual needs. All have outpatient facilities with consultants
covering all major specialities and additional services like allergy
diagnosis and incontinence advice.
Sympathetic and comfortable surroundings as well as swiftly arranged
appointments obviously add considerably to the attractions of private
health outpatient care, and the Nuffield's patients also have access to
aromatherapy and acupuncture as well as the more conventional
treatments.

NEWLY-crowned Lexington South African PGA champion Ernie Els collects
titles as ruthlessly as big game hunters once sought wildlife trophies
in this breathtakingly beautiful country.
At the tender age of 25 the equable and ever-affable South African who
conquered the world last year winning the Dubai Desert Classic, the US
Open, the Toyota World Matchplay, the Gene Sarazen World Open, and the
Johnnie Walker World Championship has now set his sights on an
unprecedented Scottish double this summer. He wants both the Open and
the Scottish Open at Carnoustie.
Els, who plays for Southern Africa against Greg Norman's Australasians
in the Alfred Dunhill Challenge later this week in Johannesburg,
includes wresting the Open title from this week's team-mate Nick Price
among his realistic goals for 1995.
He feels he knows the Old Course well enough to succeed and claims, in
all modesty, that his prodigious talents are fully capable of earning
him at least one Open Championship title and a minimum of one US Masters
green jacket.
''I have always felt that logically the two majors I could win at
least once each would be the Open and the Masters although each requires
different strategy,'' said Els. ''At Augusta you have hit to the ball
long and high whereas Open championship courses demand the ability to
hit high shots, low shots, fades, draws, pitch and runs, and the
occasional high, hard-spinning approach needed in American golf.
''To be perfectly honest, my victory in the US Open was a trifle
illogical. I was fortunate in that I drove the ball exceptionally well
at Oakmont and hitting fairways is the key to success in that
championship.''
Els loves the Old Course and has already compiled an impressive Open
record. He became the first man to break 70 in all four rounds in the
championship barely an hour before Greg Norman's name went into the
record books as the first champion to card four successive rounds in the
60s at Royal St George's in 1993.
The fact that he has now thrown in his considerable lot with the US
Tour may make it difficult for Els to achieve the first leg of his
planned Tartan double. He would dearly love play at Carnoustie, a course
he knows only by reputation and where boyhood hero Gary Player won the
1968 Open, as part of a four-week return to Europe. However, a lot
depends on whether or not US Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem will grant
him a release to compete. If his request is granted he will be a
formidable contender to be the first to win the Scottish Open and the
Open in the same year.
Els's win moves him up from No.6 to No.5 in the world rankings.
Leading rankings (Americans unless stated):
1, Nick Price (Zimbabwe) 21.89 pts av; 2, Greg Norman (Australia)
19.68; 3, Nick Faldo (Britain) 16.31; 4, Jose Maria Olazabal (Spain)

HAVING been courted and then rejected by the Scottish Golf Union,
Balbirnie Park Golf Club were last week retracing their steps to life as
it was before the ill-fated study into their bid to be home of the
proposed national golf centre.
''We feel as though we have wasted the last 14 months,'' said Andrew
Reilly, Balbirnie's course development convener, who is now reopening
the club's original plan to develop the additional land and steadings
which were acquired last year from Glenrothes Development Corporation.
The Fife club are looking for a partner to run a leisure centre in
conjunction with new golf holes and a driving range, which Reilly
pointed out is similar to the SGU idea, although this time as a private
development. They also are investigating a 16,000 square feet
residential courtyard development.
The SGU's 16 areas had first voted to investigate Balbirnie Park as
their preferred option, but, following the report by consultants TMS,
voted it out nine days ago along with the idea of associated low-cost
accommodation.
Reilly told The Herald: ''My own view is that the SGU put the cart
before the horse and didn't think their plan through properly. They
ought to have had their objectives clear from day one and sought land
and buildings with them in mind.''
He added: ''I think the SGU objectives changed in the interim and that
we were caught up in the political crossfire of what was an east-west
argument. However, we did pitch in for it.''
Last week Balbirnie Park issued a lengthy press release to express
disappointment at the SGU decision, disclose excerpts from the TMS
report which they feel are not generally known, and underline that there
is no question about the viability of the club itself.
''For the avoidance of doubt, Balbirnie Park Golf Club is in an
extremely strong financial position,'' stated Reilly, who described the
TMS report as hardly conclusive and said it was clear that the modified
national centre now under consideration would have been viable at
Balbirnie.
Among the points which he disclosed from the report was that support
from golf club members for the idea of a national golf centre is
limited, and that a top-class course at #40 a round was given much lower
ranking than a lesser known course at #15 a round.
He quoted from its conclusions: ''Although our research was not
concerned directly with alternative locations, there is nothing in our
survey results of consultations to suggest that any different option
currently available would offer a better opportunity overall than
Balbirnie -- the critical importance of location would mean that any
site would be largely out of reach for many SGU members.''
The SGU's four-man ad hoc committee, meanwhile, are again setting out
to seek possible sites for their modified project.

Another shot back were Jack Nicklaus, Simon Hobday and Bruce Lehnhard.
Following the eagle, Stockton added two birdies and one bogey to
complete the front nine, then rolled off nine straight pars on the back
nine of the Tournament Players Club of Tampa Bay for his tenth career
seniors victory.
Leading scores:
204 -- Dave Stockton 70, 66, 68.

BRITISH exporters sent 2000 tonnes of potatoes to Austria last month
-- a market which was closed until Austria joined the European Union.
A group of six British exporters has been supplying the largest potato
processor in Austria.
Potato Marketing Board export marketing manager Diana Rees said:
''With nearly eight million inhabitants and a healthy potato processing
industry, Austria is a good potential market for our growers.
''The Austrians have been paying higher-than-average prices because
they have, historically, had a closed market and they are looking for
the quality we can provide.''
The board's latest weekly report suggests that prices may have peaked
last week with prices of up to #290 a tonne for Maris Piper, Wilja and
Nadine.
On the Glasgow wholesale market, Maris Piper and Estima sold at
between #7.40 and #10 for 25kg bags. The Great Britain average ex-farm
price was #258.12p a tonne.

<HEADLINE>Meat producers losing millions over differences in standards</HEADLINE>

FARMING leaders have called for more transparency in abattoir returns
following revelations that livestock producers could be losing millions
of pounds a year because of variations in carcass specification
standards operated by meat plants.
At least four different official beef carcass dressing specifications
are being used with an estimated weight difference of 1% between each.
In addition, abattoir owners may be operating even tighter standards
demanded by specific customers.
Varying standards may be being applied for all three livestock species
among that proportion of the national kill sold on a deadweight basis --
90% of pigs, 45% of cattle and 30% of sheep.
The difference between the four official grades could be costing
producers on average #22 per cattle beast, over #2 per sheep, and about
#1.50 per pig, amounting to millions over the year.
The issue came to light towards the end of last year when farmers in
South-west England found the operators of the Class electronic
auctioneering group had switched to the new tighter European dressing
specification. Farmers were initially unaware of this but subsequently
claimed they could be losing up to #50 a head on cattle.
Following discussions between the regional office of the NFU and
Class, the issue was resolved but further investigations have revealed
complacency among farmers, much ''anecdotal'' evidence of meat companies
implementing one or other dressing standards without necessarily
informing suppliers and a decline in independent assessment as more
companies have opted out of Meat and Livestock Commission inspection.
Devon farmer Graham England, a member of the English NFU's livestock
committee, has told farmers they have only themselves to blame for
failing to check the dressing specification used and he has urged them
to send animals to plants operating MLC inspection.
Both he and Martin Burtt, the union's livestock committee chairman,
are incensed by the creation of these anomalies. ''This is clearly a
case of let the seller beware,'' said Mr Burtt. ''It reaffirms the need
for independent classification and much more transparency in the
system.''
Richard Henton, the Scottish NFU's livestock official, said there was
anecdotal evidence of anomalies in dressing standards in Scotland.
''There is a clear need for farmers to find out on what basis they are
being paid. We would also like to see independent inspection at
plants.''
The need for vigilance was underlined by Brian Pack, chief executive
of the ANM Group, which owns Scotch Premier Meat, and uses MLC
inspection. ''It is surprising how few farmers seem to care about the
question of independent inspection. But it is certainly something they
should be looking at closely.''
Both John Thorley, secretary of the National Sheep Association, and
John Godfrey, chairman of the British Pig Association, have called for
more uniformity and transparency in the system.
An MLC spokesman said: ''We are aware of the differences in dressing
specifications that are in operation and would caution farmers to be
vigilant.''

SCOTTISH Office Agriculture Minister Sir Hector Monro has expressed
surprise at the slow progress towards securing arrangements for a
successor to the Potato Marketing Board, which is to be wound up by
1997.
Potatoes had had a very good year and perhaps farmers had been too
busy to look at that issue, he suggested.
''I think we want to get something in place to look after the
long-term future, bearing in mind the particular importance of seed
potatoes in Scotland,'' he said.
A successor to the board will retain responsibility for research and
development, promotion and market information. It will no longer be able
to intervene in the market, buying up stocks in year of surplus. The
board has indicated its intention to use the full transition period to
develop a new body.
Looking at farming in general, Sir Hector declared that he was ''very
optimistic'' about the coming year, although he did concede that animal
welfare had the potential to be a major problem. While calling for very
much higher standards of transportation to the Continent he was anxious
that nothing should interfere with existing arrangements for bringing
livestock to the Scottish mainland from the islands.
Despite some predictions that the Common Agricultural Policy could not
continue in its present form, Sir Hector, speaking to farming
journalists in Edinburgh, insisted that he could not foresee any radical
changes in the next few years, although there might be some re-direction
of emphasis.
He admitted that total direct subsidies, which reached #332m last
year, were ''highly visible'' but they were also justified, he said.
''People are getting high-quality food at reasonable prices and that is
good news. Without subsidies farming just wouldn't be profitable and
would fall into malaise.
''If we don't have profitable farming it will have all sorts of
effects on the countryside and the environment. I want farmers to have a
reasonable return for the investment they make, for the effort they put
in and the labour they employ.
The member countries of the European Union were unlikely to allow
their farming industries to collapse. A great deal of effort had been
put into devising the integrated area compensation schemes and it would
be crazy to destroy that structure. ''It is complex but it is up and
running and I think we should let it run a bit longer,'' he said.
''Over the last 10 years I have heard the academics and pundits cry
wolf every year, but it hasn't happened.''
Sir Hector indicated that he had little time for any of the ''extreme
views'' on agricultural policy put forward by the Labour Party but even
if Labour were to come to power he doubted if they could have a major
impact on CAP. ''In the main we will be carried along by European policy
and, whatever the Labour Party says, it will not be able to do anything
too dramatic to the general level of subsidy.''

MORE PizzaExpress restaurants are on the menu to cope with the UK's
growing appetite for the Italian dish, the company said yesterday.
Turnover at its own restaurants was up 33% to #10.25m in the six
months to December 31 compared with the corresponding period a year
earlier.
Like-for-like sales, which exclude the effect of extra selling space,
were 7% ahead. ''This is remarkable when some of the established
restaurants have been operating since the 1960s,'' said managing
director David Page.
''We feel that opening new restaurants continues to be an attractive
way to invest our shareholders' money,'' he added.
''We are also examining possible relationships to expand abroad where
we can market our simple, stylish product to an international
audience.''
Overall turnover, which includes franchised outlets and a wholesaling
business, climbed to #14.3m from #11m and pre-tax profits on continuing
activities rose 37% to #3.04m from #2.23m.
There was also a #1.14m profit on the sale of discontinued activities
in 1993 which pushed up overall pre-tax profits in the earlier period to
#3.08m.
Earnings per share slipped from 4.5p to 4p, although the 1993 figure
is reduced to 2.9p if discontinued activities are excluded. The interim
dividend is up by a fifth from 0.5p per share to 0.6p.

The business and assets of the long-established Glasgow firm, which
called in the receivers on February 1, were purchased for an undisclosed
seven-figure sum by APC.
Funding assistance for the deal, which saves more than 80 jobs, came
from Royal Bank of Scotland's specialised lending department.
Blair Nimmo, corporate recovery partner of accountancy firm KPMG,

future business opportunities and to manage and operate a North Sea
block, writes GRAEME SMITH.
Sun Oil British Ltd stopped North Sea exploration in 1992 and the
joint venture partners will start work tomorrow. They will look at
developing fields which may not be viable for other firms and extending
the life of existing fields. The partners feel their joint expertise
will enable them to capitalise in these areas.
The joint venture will be responsible for the management and operation
of the Balmoral Floating Production Vessel as well as manpower,
logistics, engineering, and safety service.
Sun will remain as licence holder and will retain responsibility for
the management of the reservoir, product movements, and crude oil sales.
There are 150 Sun staff in the UK and 88 will transfer to Brown &amp;

EDINBURGH Japan Trust will more than double in size, if a conversion
share issue proposed yesterday by its directors goes ahead, writes IAN
McCONNELL.
With the already weakened Japanese stock market having plummeted in
the wake of last month's Kobe earthquake, Edinburgh Fund Managers want
to buy into companies they consider are undervalued.
They hope to boost the #20m fund, which aims for long-term capital
growth through investment in Japanese equities, by about #30m.
The net asset value of Edinburgh Japan, down 12.3% to 165p in the six
months to November, took another beating during January. By the end of
the month, NAV was 145p, although this was still up 52% from the trust's
launch in July 1992.
With Edinburgh Japan's shares, which closed at 139p on Friday, trading
close to NAV, the fund managers believe the proposed issue will allow
them to reap the benefits of an anticipated recovery in Japanese
corporate profits.
Iain Watt, managing director of Edinburgh Fund Managers, said: ''The
trust's launch in 1992 corresponded with a low point in the Japanese
market and the good performance since then vindicated our timing.''
''In the next few months, we see good opportunities in Japan again. We
want to take advantage of the weakness that has been caused by the
earthquake.''
Existing and new shareholders will be targeted by the proposed issue.
If it goes ahead, two portfolios will be run until the C-share money is
fully invested, when the new shares will be converted into existing ones
on a ratio basis.
Mr Watt said a further announcement on the proposed raising of
additional capital would be made in due course.

AN era will end this year at Pilkington when for the first time a
non-family member is appointed chairman, in succession to Sir Antony
Pilkington, whose family founded the firm in 1826.
Nigel Rudd, 48, the architect of Williams Holdings, is to become
non-executive chairman at the group's annual meeting in July, when Sir
Antony steps down at the board's normal retirement age of 60. Mr Rudd
has been a non-executive director since last August.
Pilkington's shares edged up 5p to 158p on the hope that Mr Rudd's
corporate talents will rub off on the glassmaker.
He has a strong following as a result of his success with Williams.
With his associate Brian McGowan he built the company up to its present
#1900m capitalisation in 13 years. Astute acquisitions, strong financial
discipline and concentration on margins have led to Williams' success.
With an experienced management team behind him Mr Rudd has more time
to take on other commitments in addition to his chairmanship of
Williams. He is also part-time chairman of East Midlands Electricity,
where his cost-cutting prowess has been evident.
His appointment will mark the first time Pilkington has a
non-executive chairman and the first time it has gone outside its own
ranks to fill the post. Mr Rudd will work with Pilkington's chief
executive of three years, Roger Leverton, who has been following a
Williams' type agenda involving cost-cutting and concentration on core
activities.
An attempt in the late 1980s by the group to escape its cyclical
exposure through diversification, notably into the US contact lens
market, proved a flop.
Right now the company is benefiting from the cyclical upturn which is
likely to take profits a lot higher is coming years. However, the
group's volatile track record has placed it on brokers' lists of
companies most vulnerable to receive a bid.
Mr Rudd now has several months to get to know the group better before
becoming chairman. Yesterday he commented: ''The company is following a
successful strategy of building its global presence through its strong
market positions. It is internationally renowned and a flagship of
British industry worldwide.''
Mr Rudd will not have a contract to work a specific number of days for
Pilkington and will be remunerated for each day he does put in. He will
not receive share options.

THE Scotch whisky industry is calling for the removal of the
26p-a-bottle tax increase imposed in the mini-Budget, which it believes
could ultimately damage crucial exports to southern Europe.
With the European Commission currently deliberating over minimum
excise rates, the industry believes Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's
duty-raising stance in December sent all the wrong signals to Brussels.
Proposals from the commission are possible as early as March 20.
More than two-fifths of the #2000m worth of whisky exported each year
ends up in European Union countries.
Southern European nations such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Italy
tax Scotch at or very close to the European Union's current 550 ecu per
hectolitre of pure alcohol minimum level. Any increase in this baseline,
particularly if coupled with the retention of the zero rate on wine,
would hurt the whisky industry.
Spain is the third-largest export market for Scotch and Italy is the
largest importer of Scottish malts. The Greeks drink more Scotch than
ouzo.
The association said: ''The Chancellor must negotiate in Europe in the
first six months of 1995 for a narrowing of tax discrimination against
Scotch whisky. His credibility is seriously weakened by the mini-Budget,
in which he did the opposite.''
The two UK budgets of 1993 froze excise duty on whisky. In his Budget
speech on November 29, the Chancellor made reference to the difficulties
faced by the industry in its home market.
However, after the Commons voted down a second tranche of VAT on
domestic fuel, duty on Scotch was raised in the mini-Budget.
The whisky industry is also calling for the resumption of moves toward
equalising duty on spirits with that on wine and beer, which are taxed
at little over half the rate per unit of alcohol. It is looking for
whisky tax cuts in the 1995 Budget.
There are also demands for the UK Government to block any proposed
increase in duty on spirits in the EU, unless this is accompanied by the
introduction of a positive rate for wine.
One of the UK's top five export earners, the Scotch whisky industry
employs about 15,000 people directly and it is believed every job
supports four more outside the industry.

A WIDE geographic and product spread has enabled the Dundee-based
packaging and materials group Low &amp; Bonar to combat competition in the
High Street and recession in several of its markets and produce healthy
profits.
In the year ended November 30, 1994, Low &amp; Bonar increased its pre-tax
profits by 40% to #44.1m.
Sales were 9% ahead on an underlying basis and grew in all markets.
Both sales and profits would have been 2% higher were it not for adverse
currency movements. Despite having 7% more shares in issue as a result
of the rights issue, earnings, and dividends were at record levels. The
dividend per share rose by 15% to 11.50p.
The figures were ahead of City expectations and prompted several
analysts to upgrade their profit forecasts for the current year by
around #5m to over #50m. Commenting on the results group chief executive
Jim Leng said he was ''pleased with the progress we have made but there
is still a lot more to do''.
The company, however, is optimistic about its ability to further
improve profitability in the current financial year despite a rise in
its raw material costs, mainly in polymer and board. So far it has
managed to pass on the 30% increase to its customers although it is
harder to do so in some industries. Low &amp; Bonar's exposure to the highly
competitive consumer packaging market is less than some of its rivals at
about a sixth of the business. Of this about a third is governed by
long-term supply contracts with large multinationals such as Kellogg's.
It has spent heavily in recent years on upgrading its capital
equipment, introducing state of the art robotics and technology which
has enabled it to increase productivity and cut staff numbers. Its
emphasis on value-added products makes it better able to withstand
competitive pressure.
Although the company is known for its packaging business, other
activities such as specialist materials and plastics account for 45% of
profits and deliver higher margins than packaging. One of its specialist
materials business is currently working flat out weaving screens for
reinforcing dikes in Holland.
Despite the heavy capital spend, the company's balance sheet remains
healthy. Cashflow was strong enabling the group to end the year with net
cash of #7m and no gearing. Since the year-end the cash position has
improved following the sale of the Bonar Bibby &amp; Baron business. It made
bags for High Street stores. Rival company British Polythene Industries
has also recently reduced its UK presence in this market, transferring
production to China.
Low &amp; Bonar has identified a number of good growth opportunities in
which to invest in the current year. In addition, it remains on the
lookout for complementary acquisitions in its existing geographic
territories of Europe and North America. Overall capital expenditure is
expected to be about #30m.
The combination of healthy demand for many of its higher margin
products, such as artificial playing surfaces, continued investment in
increasing efficiency and the prospect of progressive dividend increases
make the shares attractive. The City liked the look of the results and
the group's future prospects and marked the shares up 27p to 408p.

CLOTHING and Textiles group Coats Viyella is paying #65m for a US
precision engineering company Bace Manufacturing, writes NICOLA REEVES.
The business, which trades as SPM, will complement Dynacast, Coats'
existing precision engineering company. A total of #51m is to be paid in
cash with the remaining #14m assumed in existing SPM debt.
Coats expects the acquisition to be earnings enhancing in 1995. The
purchase will push up gearing, but only to about 9%. Neville Bain,
Coats' chief executive, said the acquisition of SPM would give the
division ''access to world class plastic moulding technology and an
outstanding customer base''. Further small bolt-on acquisitions to the
division are possible.
SPM employs 1100 people in eight US plants and its customer base
includes the communications, computer, motor, and electronic industries.
Last year it made a profit before interest and tax of $10.4m (#6.6m) on
sales of $115.4m (#72.9m).
Coats Viyella also announced yesterday that it plans to complete the
sale of its yarns business by March. It is currently in negotiations
with venture capitalists in order to make the business independent and
avoid any job losses.
The decision to sell the business along with the carpets activities
was made last year in order to allow the group to focus on its core
activities. Most of the carpet division has already been sold to Shaw
Industries of the US for #19m.
Talks are continuing on the sale of Navan Carpets, an Axminster
weaving plant based in the Irish Republic.

STERLING was again undermined yesterday by the Government's fragility.
The death of Scottish MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn added to the Prime
Minister's woes, and in the view of foreign exchange dealers reduced his
chances of completing his five-year term.
The pound lost 1.17 pfennigs to DM2.3340 and is within two pfennigs of
its all-time low of 2.3150 against the German mark in February 1995. At
the start of the month, sterling was trading at DM2.41 and should have
been boosted by the subsequent half-point rise in base rates to 6.75%.
But the Government's divisions over Europe and its growing
vulnerability to the loss of support by its Ulster Unionist allies have
upset the apple cart at the same time as the dollar, weakened by the
financial crisis in Mexico, has come under severe pressure from the
mark. The mark is enjoying an enhanced status as a safe haven from
currencies inside and outside Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
The pound, however, has been making headway against the dollar. US
markets were closed yesterday for the President's Day holiday, and
sterling edged up O.61 cents to $1.5826.
It is too early to talk about a sterling crisis, though yesterday
currency upsets spilled over into the stock market, where the FTSE-100
share index dropped 25.6 points to 3018.6. The Friday night fall on Wall
Street ahead of the holiday weekend was also a negative factor in
lack-lustre equity trading with volumes exceptionally low.
The Bank of England has no target rates for sterling, though it is
known to monitor the trade-weighted exchange rate closely in determining
monetary policy. Overall this has held up quite well, though the 0.2
decline to 86.9 yesterday took it back to its 1994 low.
The pound's decline against the mark (and to a lesser extent other ERM
currencies) should benefit manufacturing exports while its modest gains
against the dollar should provide limited compensation for the upsurge
in commodity prices.
But if sterling lost too much ground against the mark, the problems of
over-heating in the most resilient export-orientated manufacturing
sectors would be aggravated with deleterious consequences for inflation.
Though the bulk of British exports go the European Union, the lion's
share of Britain plc's overseas profits are still derived from the US. A
lower rate against the dollar would enhance the sterling value of the
dollar-denominated profits of the UK's multi-national sector and would
boost the Footsie index.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to see why sterling's plight against the
mark should be seen as a negative influence on equity prices, unless one
takes the view that interest rates will be forced higher by a sterling
crisis.
Strong growth
in M4 lending
FOR the third month in a row, M4 bank and building society lending has
been strong, indicating that the corporate sector is at last beginning
to borrow again from the commercial banks.
NatWest, which posts its annual results this morning, was one of only
a handful of big board stocks to make any headway in yesterday's
depressed stock market. The shares gained 3p to 493p with Barclays
unchanged at 605p.
Bank of England figures showed that M4 lending rose from #3900m in
December to #4600m last month, against expectations of a #3200m advance.
M4 lending has been in the doldrums as companies sought to rebuild
their balance sheets from the ravages of the recession and the excess
borrowing of the eighties. Companies too were able to raise finance from
the stock market, but with share prices in retreat for much of last year
equity issues have lost some of their attractions to the issuers.
Part of the reason for the sea change may be that companies are
increasing their investment programmes. Investment has been the laggard
in the economic recovery.
Detailed figures tomorrow for fourth quarter gross domestic product,
provisionally estimated to have grown by 0.8%, are expected to show a
recovery in investment.
Separate figures from the British Bankers' Association showed that the
domestic banks lent #2908m to companies and consumers in January, the
highest figure for nearly five years and more than double December's
#1331m.
There is a gap between the BBA and the Bank of England figures, which
is largely accounted for by lending by foreign banks to the corporate
sector. This first showed up in November and December, but now seems to
have spread to the major British banks.
However, the BBA was cautious. Its director general, Tim Sweeney, said
part of the lending to securities dealers was short-term and reflected
the substantial corporation tax payments last month.
''So it would be premature to say that companies have returned to the
banks for their finance, although their use of capital markets was much
lower in January.''
Mr Sweeney also suggested that the pick up in lending to retailers and
wholesalers was a result of the recent slowdown in consumer spending
depressing cash flows.
However, personal borrowing seems to have held up well last month.
Credit card borrowing did not fall back as much as the norm in January,
despite the fall in retail sales.
''This suggests that more consumers are feeling the squeeze on
disposable incomes than any sign of growing confidence,'' Mr Sweeney
said.
Separate figures from the Building Societies Association show that
mortgage lending remains subdued.
The consumer is undoubtedly being squeezed by higher interest rates
and tax while buoyant exports are boosting the manufacturing sector.
This imbalance, in marked contrast to what happened in the eighties,
should help sustain the recovery, but it does not help the feel good
factor or the Government's political standing.
Meanwhile, broad M4 rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.3% last month. The
annual rate edged down from 4.5% in December to 4.3%, but the
three-month annualised rate is already up to 5.7%, suggesting a long
overdue recovery in M4 is in the pipeline.

GROSS mortgage lending fell to #2318m in January from December's
#2891m but there was a slight increase at the net level from #623m to
#696m, according to the latest figures from the Building Societies'
Association, writes CHRIS STONE.
Net new commitments, though, were down from #2456m to #2012m over the
month.
Compared to January 1994, gross advances were up 12.6% and there was
also a small increase in net advances but confidence is still lacking
with little sign of an upturn in the housing market.
Adrian Coles, the BSA's director-general, says that given the recent
increases in interest rates, increased taxation and changes in the
income support arrangements, borrowers are likely to remain cautious for
the foreseeable future.
The decision by societies not to increase their lending rates after
the latest hike in base rates reflects their concern not to depress
further the stagnant market.
Mr Coles said that property sales are reported by the Ombudsman for
Corporate Estate Agents to have fallen by 16% in January compared with
January 1994. The fact that building society net and gross lending
increased during the same period suggests that societies may have
increased their market share.
In the saving market, there was an inflow of #576m in January,
following an inflow of #694m the month earlier. Mr Coles commented:
''The very low levels of retail spending in January, even accounting for
seasonal factors, along with the recent lack of competition from
National Savings and equity-based products, allowed societies to realise
their seventh consecutive month of inflow and the largest January inflow
since 1991.''
However, the flotation of the remaining Government shares in National
Power and PowerGen means that societies are likely to experience large
withdrawals at the end of February and the beginning of March.
* CONSUMER confidence in Britain, as measured by their views on the
financial position of their households, fell in February, according to a
survey by Gallup published yesterday.
The survey, conducted on behalf of the European Commission, showed a
balance of minus 11% compared with minus 10% in January, indicating
people expect their household finances to deteriorate in the next 12
months.
The percentage balance is derived by subtracting those responding
negatively from those responding positively.
It also showed a fall in optimism regarding the general economic
situation, with a percentage balance of minus 14, from minus 4% in
January.
The balance saying that now was the right time to make major purchases
also deteriorated, to 9% in February from 11% in January. -- Reuter

SAATCHI &amp; Saatchi yesterday announced new executive incentives schemes
as it confirmed its new name would be Cordiant.
Officially the renaming is to avoid confusion with one of the
principal operating subsidiaries, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising
Worldwide, which will continue with this name. But it was clearly not
possible to carry on with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi for the holding company in
the light of recent events.
The name was thought up by the group's in-house corporate identity
business, Siegel &amp; Gale, and was chosen as an expression of the new
spirit of the company, ''characterised by accord and shared purpose.''
The name represents the holding company at the core or heart of the
group.
A particularly generous options package proposed for Maurice Saatchi
provoked the split with the Saatchis and the group has produced a number
of new schemes for shareholder approval.
The idea is for variable performance related pay and incentives to
make up a larger proportion of executives' remuneration. As many as 750
senior staff will participate in a phantom share option scheme. This
would give them mock shares in their operating subsidiaries which, if
performance targets were met, would then be converted into actual
Cordiant shares.
A narrower group of up to 40 executives, those working for the parent
company and the top network executives with parent company
responsibilities, would be granted options which could be excercised if
over any three-year period earnings per share grew by more than the
retail price index plus 2%.
There would also be a super option variant, potentially worth millions
of pounds, just for chairman Charlie Scott which would be triggered if
earnings per share growth was in the top quarter of that achieved by the
leading 100 FTSE companies during a five-year period. The group said the
schemes would comply with current institutional guidelines.
Finally the share-saving scheme would be renewed and extended
throughout the group.

<HEADLINE>Mexican peso strengthens on interest rate plan</HEADLINE>

Mexico City, Monday -- The new peso gave back some early gains but
still closed sharply higher after the Banco de Mexico announced an
interest rate plan to boost the exchange rate, traders said.
The 24 and 48-hour new peso closed 16 centavos higher at 5.54/5.59 per
dollar, after having gained as much as 28 centavos earlier in the day.
The peso posted early gains after Mexico's central bank said it would
push up short-term domestic interest rates by as much as 10 percentage
points with a view to strengthening the peso and lowering interest rates
in the longer run.
''The peso stopped its rise when the rate reached 5.45 per dollar.
Investors decided they would take their profits and started selling
pesos,'' one trader said.
The peso also moved on expectations that the United States and Mexico
would soon finalise details of $20bn aid for the battered Mexican
economy.
Meanwhile, stock prices fell by over 3% in very light trade.
The IPC index of 37 leading shares gave up 55.11 points to 1775.36.
''The market is weak but inclined towards selling because people are
getting out because of the interest rates thing,'' one trader said.
''An increase of that kind would leave shares out of the game as an
investment alternative, and would also affect the outlook for companies
in the short term,'' one analyst said.
Analysts said open market operations by the central bank on the
secondary money market were already suggesting primary rates would rise
sharply in this week's primary auction of T-bills, results of which are
announced on Wednesday.
Volume on the stock exchange was hit by a market holiday in the United
States and reached only a lifeless 14.12 million shares. -- Reuter.

Continuing her series on relationships
forged under trying circumstances,
Anvar Khan meets a pair who have been
tried in the furnace of drug addiction.
THE collective authority on relationships, such as counsellors, social
workers and psychologists, would not risk their professional reputations
by pronouncing that stable partnerships can survive drug addiction. It's
safer to insist that drugs, of any nature, ruin people of any calibre
and couples of any level of commitment. Helen Morses, 19, and John
McDonald, 21, are spectacular examples of how wrong everyone else can
be. Drugs were the love of their life, but they kicked them for the life
of their love.
''I fell in love with Helen the first night we got together,''
remembers John. ''But eventually the drugs became more important. I used
to wake up in the morning and want Helen, then I started to wake up and
want drugs instead.''
Both John and Helen had a regular habit before they got together.
''Before John, I was in a relationship with an older guy and he was a
user,'' explains Helen. ''He introduced me to hydrochlodine and
temgesics. I was 16 at the time and was at college doing a three-month
business administration course. I never finished it.''
John and Helen's home backgrounds are comparable. Helen's parents
divorced when she was 11. She eventually moved in with her gran. John's
parents split up when he was 11 too. (''I started using cannabis at
12.'') When they became involved, John was a dope-dealer and Helen was
regularly stealing her grandpa's prescribed painkillers. Drugs became
inherent to their relationship.
John: ''At this time we were taking drugs every day. I sold cannabis
to feed my habit. Before that I was a Giro-junkie, benefit money kept my
drug addiction going. At first the relationship was all right. We went
down to London together. My Dad had a job for me there as a general
labourer.''
Helen got a job in a mechanical engineers' as a secretary, but they
got homesick.
Helen: ''When we got back, heroin had just hit our area. Baillieston
was like a puppet with a band, everybody was taking it. I had it once at
a party, before I was going out with John. I just tried it, once. I knew
if I'd kept taking it, I would have got addicted, because it was too
good.''
Meanwhile, Helen's gran had noticed that her husband's tablets were
disappearing. At first, she thought the chemist was making a mistake,
until her doctor told her junkies used them. She confronted Helen, who
denied all knowledge. Eventually, Helen left. She moved into John's
bedroom in a house already full with two sisters and a mum.
John: ''My mum didn't have a clue what was happening to me. I didn't
think I had the need to tell her.''
The two adopted a set routine.
John: ''I had a car. We'd go to bed at night, get up at five in the
afternoon. Take dehydrochlodine as were getting out of bed, get washed,
into the car, go to McDonald's, go and see my friends and what cannabis
they were wanting. We never saw daylight. That went on for a long time.
Five or six months.''
Helen: ''One night we needed tablets. We couldn't get them so we
thought, let's just get a bit of smack. One of John's pals had died of
an overdose. It cut us up a bit but it didn't stop us.''
John: ''Before heroin, I had money. Then I was selling my clothes. It
wasn't until the end of my herion addiction that I told my mum.''
At this point, John and Helen had been taking heroin for half of their
two-year relationship. Helen: ''Whatever John took, I took, whatever I
took, he took.''
John: ''We'd fight. I would wreck my bedroom. Then I'd go out, get
some drugs, come back, we'd take them, we'd be all over each other, all
lovey-dovey and happy. Everything was OK, until the next day.''
Helen: ''I started to get depressed. I stayed in the room for days. I
wouldn't talk to anybody.''
John: ''We had nothing. We didn't get washed. Using drugs all the
time, you're not interested in yourself. We started to have more fights,
more arguments. I came out the worst. One thing I've never done is lift
my hand to Helen, but I wish I could say the same for her. I'd have
scratches on my face and throat. Maybe she hadn't tidied up, or put a
pair of trainers away, or there weren't any messages in the house, it
was just stupid.''
Their relationship, as lovers, began in September 1992. It was now
summer 1994 and they were bound by addiction. They wanted to stop.
Helen: ''I went to the doctor's to see if I could get a detox. He said
he couldn't help me and threw me out his practice.''
They eventually found the support they needed at a drug rehabilitation
centre, Calton Athletic, Dennistoun, in August last year.
John: ''When we came at first, the club said they didn't think we'd
make it because it was hard for a couple. If I went out the door, maybe
Helen would come with me and vice-versa. One of the guys told me that if
I didn't come off heroin I would die. But I wanted a long life with
Helen.''
Helen: ''We had to change our personalities, change our attitudes, our
lifestyle, our pals. Stay away from our friends who sold drugs. We had a
drug dealer staying at either end of our street. Determination kept us
together. I didn't want to lose John and he didn't want to lose me. We
did everything the club asked us, and after a few weeks our heads
started to clear. We got our feelings back. We realised how much we
loved each other and we had to make it work. At that time, if John had
started to use again then so would I.''
John: ''But today, if Helen started to use drugs then I wouldn't have
anything to do with her. That's the way it's got to be. The same applies
to me. If I take drugs she's to gather me by the neck and boot me out.
I've got friends but they're all users. My best friend is Helen, she's
all I need now. They're just there to drag me down.''

Why does the Government accept that women
can work and care for children, but doesn't
seem to believe that men can care as well
as work? RUSSELL ECOB puts the case for
equal benefits for bereaved fathers
The National Insurance
system provides no benefits
for widowers. In contrast, a
widow gets a tax-free lump
sum of #1000 and a widowed
mothers' weekly allowance
I AM a widower with two dependent children. My wife died around three
years ago from cancer. For much of the time since then I have
concentrated my energies on coming to terms with the emotional
consequences and keeping the family together. In the process I have
drawn a lot of strength from my children, now aged 13 and nine.
Much of the challenge over these years was in simply making ends meet.
Though I have a relatively permanent job (as far as these things go),
and the endowment mortgage was paid off, I was finding that the loss of
an extra income was hard to compensate for. In particular I have little
in the way of a widower's pension as my wife, working mainly in the
private sector, hadn't considered it necessary until latterly to take
out a life assurance policy. Child care has been by far the largest of
my expenses. However, I consider good child care a necessity.
I have often wondered why conversations with others, including those
within a bereavement group, never get on to the subject of finances.
There seems to be a taboo attached to this issue. I am not clear to what
degree it is exacerbated by the common financial problems of people, a
disinclination to share financial worries or a dislike of prying into
others' affairs and if necessary giving advice. A determination to cope
emotionally is often equated in a bereaved person with a determination
to carry on in the same way.
I had to move house. This was the last thing I wanted to do as I was
very attached to my house. Though in the first year after my wife's
death I appeared to be able to manage, partly through a set of fortunate
circumstances (and a lot of goodwill from friends), it soon appeared
obvious I couldn't carry on in the same way. I was letting out
simultaneously to three and sometimes four tenants, and supplementing
this with bed and breakfast, registered with the Greater Glasgow Tourist
Board. This was difficult to keep up as well as a full-time job --
though I probably would have if tenants had been easier to find and
there was more demand for bed and breakfast. However, we stayed at some
distance from universities and colleges, and the local hospital, for a
long time a supply of nursing students, had recently cut back on
training.
Why has my house move been necessary? Only recently did I find out
that if I had been a widow I probably wouldn't have had to move! This
was around six months ago through reading the press coverage of a
campaign centred around a private member's bill to obtain equal benefit
provisions for widows and widowers with dependent children. The 1948
National Insurance system, resulting from the earlier Beveridge report,
provides no benefits for widowers. In contrast, a widow gets a tax-free
lump sum of #1000 on the death of her spouse and, more importantly, from
there on a non-means tested basic widowed mothers' weekly allowance
(dependent on husband's full NI contributions) of #57.60. For each
child, in addition to usual child benefit, she gets at least #9.80.
Similar discrepancies are found in pensions (even without dependent
children).
In this inequality, Britain stands despicably alone in the European
Union, apart from Greece and Luxembourg, a new widowers' pension having
just been introduced in Ireland. The equalisation in other EU countries
has arisen mainly from a resolution from the European Parliament in
1984, at a time when statutory schemes for surviving husbands were
virtually unknown. This called for the commission to lay down a number
of principles with regard to survivors' pensions or benefits. These
principles include the requirement that, whether or not they have
dependent children, widowers should receive the same benefit as widows.
Equality of benefits for widowers has been a concern of bereavement
care groups, such as Cruse, and of hospices, particularly through the
National Council for Hospice and Specialist Palliative Care Services.
Last year pressure resulted in a private member's bill submitted under
the ten-minute rule by the Conservative MP for Finchley. His concern was
for a constituent widower who has nine children under 20, of whom six
are still dependent. He had given up his job to care for his wife
through her illness and was not able to find another with comparable pay
and conditions. The bill was thrown out by the Government on its third
reading. Reasons given, publicly and through hearsay, are that the costs
cannot be afforded, and that widows are more in need of financial help
than widowers. As a widower recently said: ''The Government can accept
the women can work as well as care. Why can't it accept that men can
care as well as work?''
There are around 60,000 families with dependent children being headed
by a widower. This comprises around one in 300 families with dependent
children, and around a quarter of the number of such families headed by
a widow. It has been estimated that the implementation of a ''fair
treatment for widowers'' bill would cost around one per cent of the cost
of the disabled bill.
What is the reason for the apparent lack of publicity given to the
issue? I am inclined to the view that it is a combination of the taboo
in our culture associated with death (and perhaps also benefits) and the
relatively small chance of this happening to any particular person. In
addition, widowers are not a high-profile group, tending to be known,
and treated as such, only to relatives, close friends and neighbours.
They are relatively randomly distributed in society.
What is being done? A campaignis being mounted to take the Government
to the House of Lords, using existing sex discrimination legislation as
the basis for the appeal. Any offers of help, donations or sponsorship
would be much appreciated. Contact John Kao, organiser, The Fair
Treatment of Widowers Campaign, 61 Beechwood Avenue, Finchley, London N3
3BB (tel 0181-343 2204).

* WOMEN prepared to work in non-traditional areas are desperately
needed by a Glasgow-based training group, WISE, who are looking for 100
women to take part in a series of courses lasting 9-12 months doing a
variety of projects. Some are manual, others semi-skilled and there's
even an opportunity to do some work in the horticultural field.
While the pay is not great -- #116 a week -- it does offer training
and work experience. There is no guarantee of a job at the end of the
course, but those who complete one have an above-average chance of
finding work.
Ian Gilmour of WISE says they have great difficulty finding women to
go on training projects. One of their latest courses has four women and
eight men. They discovered recently that one of the reasons for their
difficulties is that most people come to them from the Job Clubs, and
women are not registered as unemployed.
For further information contact Ian Gilmour or Isabel McCarroll, WISE
Training Group, 72 Charlotte Street, Glasgow. G1 5DW. Recruitment
Hotline: 041-553 1050.
* YOU may like or loathe the idea of shopping by post, but all the
signs are that this will become a facet of future living. One of the
brightest catalogues to drop through our letterbox this week is the
glossy spring edition of Past Times, a cornucopia of nostalgia. It has
an irresistible range of decorative accessories and gifts inspired by
the past, from Anglo-Saxon and Viking to Tudor and Stuart.
Among the items on offer, ideal for Mothering Sunday on March 26, is
the book A Celebration of Mothers, offering a collection of poetry and
prose in praise of mothers, including extracts from Kipling, Wodehouse,
and Jane Austen, #9.99. Or how about an ornamental pincushion made from
pewter (#7.50), very much in vogue during the Victorian era? Or a Gothic
mirror (pictured here) based on a thirteenth-century lancet window, at
#39.95? You can pop into their shops in Buchanan Street, Glasgow
(041-226 2277); Frederick Street, Edinburgh (031-225 5853) and Union
Street, Aberdeen (01224-2128890, or use the 24-hour personal telephone
service (01993 779444) for a catalogue and/or to place an order.
* THIS is a call to all artists in Scotland: do you want to have your
work auctioned by the prestigious firm of art dealers, Phillips
(Scotland), in aid of charity? (It may be the only time it comes under
such a distinguished hammer!)
This opportunity arises because of an unusual fund-raising event
organised by the Imperial Cancer Scottish Centre. They are asking
artists to donate paintings, ceramics, jewellery, sculpture, and other
objets d'art for an auction to take place on March 23 at Prestonfield
House hotel, Edinburgh. The names of all donating companies and
individuals will be published in the auction catalogue and artists will
receive half of the hammer price.
Deadline next Tuesday. Further information from Hazel Wilson, Imperial
Cancer Scottish Centre, Wallace House, Maxwell Place, Stirling FK8 IJU

WHEN Janet Henderson discovered the gallery booked for her next
exhibition had gone into receivership, she had to find an alternative at
short notice and was offered this space.
Three days later she opened in the old Sweetie Express shop, near
platform 11, after transforming the bright pink and orange interior. The
result is a terrific space, well suited to its current installation of
work from Henderson and three other artists.
Her work ranges from a lizard set in resin via wax shirts and slate
texts to 60 small grey images of clothing titled We Are What We Were,
which she made for her clothes-obsessed boyfriend. Bra, jeans, socks,
waistcoat and Doc Martens have titles engraved on the glass: Passion,
Malice, Lust (for the bra), Guilt (pants) and Ecstasy (hat) -- a nicely
understated series. She found the lizard in Bolivia while
artist-in-residence there.
The floor is filled with rolls of golden-brown oven sheets sandwiched
between tracing paper to create spectacular scuptural textured tubes (by
London's Nigel Cook, courtesy of Safeway Bakery). Olivia Steven's paper
scrolls and Kathleen Little's beautiful close-up photos of lillies and
sunflowers complement the whole.
Henderson's original venue was Drumchapel's Mercat, because of her
desire to take art to people intimidated by ordinary galleries. This is
even better. Till February 28th.

Thanks to a little help from their friend, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber,
the much-travelled National Youth Music Theatre make a welcome return to
Edinburgh tonight en route to Broadway. Mark Fisher reports.
REGULAR visitors to the Edinburgh Festival will be familiar with the
name of the National Youth Music Theatre. The London-based company that
showcases the cream of young talent in lavish large-scale musicals has
been turning up at both the Fringe and the international festival for
the past 19 years, clocking up six Fringe First awards and building up a
loyal audience in the process.
But despite an extensive touring schedule, the company has never
appeared in Edinburgh outside August. And if it wasn't for the curiosity
of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, it is possible that Pendragon, which opens
tonight at the city's Festival Theatre, might only ever have been seen
on last year's Fringe.
''I'm an opportunist,'' says artistic director Jeremy James Taylor.
''No-one's going to say come in if you don't knock. Sir Andrew came up
to see Pendragon at the George Square Theatre and suggested we should go
and look round the new Festival Theatre. We were given a guided tour and
we suggested to the theatre manager that he should see our show. He
loved it and we said we'd love to come.''
Having Lloyd Webber on your side is clearly an advantage. The company
has just announced that, thanks to the backing of the multi-millionaire
composer who is officially billed as the NYMT's chief supporter,
Pendragon will open on Broadway this October. Add to this the dates in
Hong Kong and Taiwan in early-August and you have a more than averagely
travelled youth show.
But then the NYMT is a more than average youth theatre. Since its
foundation in 1976, it has tackled subjects as contentious as poverty
and pacifism, plays from Bertolt Brecht to Lionel Bart, and introduced
more than two dozen shows to the once limited repertoire of young
people's theatre. In 1980 it had to bill a show about a psychopathic
13-year-old as being unsuitable for children -- even though the average
age of the cast was 14. And if you're worried about professional
standards, bear in mind that six former members are currently taking
major leads in West End shows.
Pendragon, the company's own version of the Arthurian legend, is a
typically ambitious combination of poetry, puppetry, magic, mime, and
music, featuring a cast of 28 (''quite a small company by our
standards'') and a captivating design by puppet-maker Alison Darke,
formerly of the Jim Henson Creature Workshop.
''The Arthurian thing turns out to be smashing,'' says Taylor. ''There
are so many different versions of the same story that we didn't have any
qualms about inventing things; it's a fairy story, it's a legend, it's
magic. These are pretty bright kids, they're 28 of the best in the land,
and we use what they can come up with and teach them anything we know.
We combine raw talent and skill with a bit of professional know-how. Add
music and it just seems to work.''

WITHOUT its sweetmeats by Nicolai and Johann Strauss, the BBC's
Edinburgh concert series entitled Mahler and More is providing less than
was originally promised; but as Sunday's programme confirmed, this
remains a skilfully devised project, with Vienna as its focus and
Mahler's vocal music as its running theme.
In performance terms, moreover, the second of the three concerts was a
considerable improvement on the first. With an Austrian baritone as
eloquent as Wolfgang Holzmair as soloist, the Songs of a Wayfarer could
be expected to be voiced with exceptional finesse. But the soft-grained
beauty with which he sang them went beyond expectations, and made his
sudden exclamations, whether of happiness or anguish, all the more
telling.
Though a greatly inflated BBC SSO had been crammed on to the Festival
Theatre's stage, Pinchas Steinberg -- as his brisk account of Haydn's
48th symphony had already shown -- was a conductor who ensured that
nothing was allowed to drift. Mahler's sharp, clear timbres made their
point without Bernstein-style exaggeration, and the performance, by
quite different means, achieved the intimacy of Schoenberg's chamber
version of the same songs heard in Edinburgh a few nights previously.
Compared with the light and shade of the Mahler, Holzmair's treatment
of four great Hugo Wolf songs was a study in total darkness. But gloom
was later swept aside by Steinberg's brilliant, hard-pressed account of
Beethoven's seventh symphony -- a crackling reminder of what Beethoven
must have sounded like in the days when symphonies were performed in
theatres rather than concert halls.

Are Scotland's playwrights at a loss for words? Sara Villiers finds
that book adaptations are taking centre stage this year.
SEEN a good novel recently? If you are keeping up to date with
literary sensations then you are as likely to be leafing through a
theatre programme as flicking through the pages of a book, with an
astonishing amount of adaptations annexing Scottish stages throughout
the coming year.
It's a trend which has flourished dramatically in the past few years,
encouraged by the high profile successes of theatrical versions of Lewis
Grassic Gibbon's The Scots Quair (TAG), Iain Banks's The Wasp Factory
(Citizens' Theatre Company), Banks's The Bridge (Benchtours), Irvine
Welsh's Trainspotting (Citizens') and Neil Gunn's The Silver Darlings
(Wildcat).
Coming soon on a stage near you will be Pickwick at Edinburgh Festival
Theatre, with Sir Harry Secombe starring in the musical version of
Dickens's Pickwick Papers, the musical adaptation of L. Frank Baum's The
Wizard of Oz at the same venue, Liz Lochhead's take on Bram Stoker's
Dracula at Dundee Rep, Strathclyde Theatre Group's dramatisation of
Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis at the Ramshorn Theatre in Glasgow, sketches
from Neil Munro's Para Handy by Alastair McDonald at the Cottier Theatre
in Glasgow, Alasdair Gray's Lanark by TAG and a production of Janice
Galloway's The Trick Is To Keep Breathing, starring Eddi Reader, at the
Tron this summer.
''At the moment the Scottish novel is on a real high,'' observes
Michael Boyd, artistic director at the Tron. ''I'm not sure that the
body of work by Iain Banks, Janice Galloway, Irvine Welsh, Alasdair
Gray, Allan Massie, and others is rivalled by that of the Scottish
playwrights. And that's fine. Times change. At the moment the novel
seems to be confident and galloping ahead.''
The most blatant example of the novel's takeover bid of the stage is
in the Citizens' spring progamme. More than a third of the productions
playing in the three theatres are based on popular books, including the
Citizens' Theatre Company's versions of Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting and
Jeff Torrington's Swing Hammer Swing!, Clyde Unity Theatre Company
following their previous Citz hit of Margaret Thomson Davis's Rag Woman,
Rich Woman with a production of the same author's Breadmakers, 7:84's
Born Guilty, from three books by Peter Sichrovsky, and Empty Space
Theatre Company's adaptation of Virginia Woolf's To The Lighthouse.
Giles Havergal, artistic director of the Citizens', is adapting Swing
Hammer Swing! and believes that Torrington's title, along with the other
Scottish books Trainspotters and Breadmakers, is ideal for pulling in
much-needed new audiences. This point was certainly proven last year,
when young, typically theatre-shy audiences turned up in droves for
Trainspotting at both the Citizens' and the Traverse in Edinburgh.
Doubtless that's the reason the Citizens' are taking a second crack at
Welsh's cult chronicle of junkie life in Edinburgh. It has already
proven a sound financial bet, with only a few tickets left for its final
third week.
The decision to stage it a second time smacks of cynical
commercialism. Welsh's novel is a landmark in popular culture, speaking
directly to disaffected Scottish youth, but does it merit another
production so soon at a time when new plays are notable by their
absence? Harry Gibson, who adapted the version directed by Ian Brown
last year, and who is directing this time round, insists that this is a
vital work and invokes the lingo of the post-modern sampler to make his
point.
''It is new and different. Iain's production could be described as a
kind of ravey, thrash gig production while this is the ambient remix. It
has a trancey feel with lots of deep, dark lighting effects.''
Gibson, who has previously staged theatrical versions of films, like
Hitchcock's Psycho, in New York, wanted to stage Trainspotting from the
moment he turned the first page, attracted by the vibrant vernacular and
non-linear narrative stucture.
''When I came back to Scotland I read lots of scripts but I didn't
think I was reading anything terribly interesting. I think the problem
is that too many Scottish playwrights are sitting at home trying to
write the kinds of plays they like seeing so there isn't anything new or
exciting happening. Perhaps they're too removed from the theatrical
process? If you look back over the history of theatre then some of the
best work has been produced by those immersed in it, actors turned
playwrights, from Shakespeare to Pinter.''
Short of devising a work, adapting a novel can allow a director and
cast greater freedom than sticking closely to a commissioned script.
Writer A L Kennedy, who originally adapted Salman Rushdie's Haroun and
the Sea of Stories for Benchtours, withdrew from the project when the
cast started playing with her script in rehearsal.
Benchtours, who have previously adapted Don Quixote, and produced a
stunning intensely physical piece based on Iain Banks's The Bridge last
Mayfest, enjoy the challenge of the theatrical representation of
literary themes. ''Adapting a novel can liberate the imagination,''
points out John Cobb, director of Haroun and the Sea of Stories, which
is currently playing the Traverse before a national tour.
''You can take an image and create it with actors and while audiences
expect verisimilitude from film adaptations they don't expect stage
versions to be so true to the book.''
''And it's cheaper than commissioning a new play,'' adds Benchtour
actor Stewart Ennis, tellingly.
So, is it salad days for the novelists, reaping in the stage
adaptations fees and boosted book sales from attendant publicity? Rather
it looks like it is time for an urgent response from Scottish
playwrights to this latest threat to their livelihood.
Too many playwrights are sitting at home trying to write the kinds of
plays they like seeing so there isn't anything new happening

''DON'T step on the sand,'' said an usher, in suitably hissing Theban
chorus tones, as we sat in the packed Chandler Theatre for the second
year DDA students' production of Ted Hughes's translation of the ghastly
Greek myth. There wasn't much sand to disturb -- it was spread thinly
across the empty studio, symbolising an arid, plague-ridden kingdom.
As the chorus writhed across its surface the sand scratched patterns
in the floor, a disturbing sound which added to their discordant
cacophony.
Seneca's Oedipus is a much darker version of Sophocles's Oedipus Rex,
with an anti-hero and an onstage death, and Hughes's translation wrings
out its goulish depths with a rich pungency. Jocasta, recalling her
son's birth, plucks a doom-laden metaphor from the air, describing him
as ''like a bright new weapon'', ironically unaware of the familial
destruction her infant would unwittingly reap.
Oedipus, draped in his blood-soaked blindfold, cradles his grief and
spurns his mother with ''you're spoiling my comfortable darkness''.
The cast capably build a chilling atmosphere around the central maxim
that ''fate is the master of everything'', with director Mark Saunders
weaving elaborate choreographed chorus routines with the striking
soliloquies. Some of the performances are rather overwrought, which is
hardly surprising given the melodrama of the language, but Mark Bonnar
imbues Oedipus with vivid yet controlled life, bringing mature and
calculated insight to the character's impassioned hysteria.
The horrors of the play are counterpointed at the end, as the choir
lurches into a cheery gospel chant, donning sunglasses to satirise
Oedipus's tragedy -- a crude joke which diminishes the tensions that
preceded it.

THE death of Sir Nicholas Fairbairn should trouble you. It is not
merely the loss of a highly individual and entertaining politician. Nor
is it a matter of sympathy for a grieving family, though the late MP has
undoubtedly left broken hearts behind him. It is the continuing denial
of a reality which, every year, destroys some of the ablest people in
the land.
Everyone knows why Sir Nicholas died. For most of his life, he drank
far too much; by the end of his career, he was a hopeless alcoholic. The
liver disease that finally killed him was, undoubtedly, down to booze.
But the many tributes now being paid are silent. They are as silent as
they were when playwright John Osborne and comedian Peter Cook died
about the turn of the year. They, too, were brilliant personalities.
Both, as everyone knows and no-one will say, were slain by the bottle.
The list is endless. Footballers, like George Best or Jim Baxter, have
declined into decrepit, shambling obesity after years of heavy drinking.
Some of the greatest writers of this century -- Faulkner, Fitzgerald --
pickled their brains into sausagemeat. Dylan Thomas, that lyricist of
the valleys, died a squalid death from booze 40 years ago. Royalty are
not immune: the late Duke of Gloucester was a notorious drunkard.
He, at least, was able to hide his weakness from the public. For
Fairbairn, there was at the last no retreat. In his final years, he was
often visibly ''unwell'' on television. He would stand to speak in the
Commons, swaying unnervingly, his face the hard mask of the inebriate.
Fairbairn, in his day, had a delicious wit. ''The Honourable Lady
herself was once an egg,'' he taunted Edwina Currie in the Commons at
the height of the salmonella frenzy, ''and many on both sides of the
House regret its fertilisation.'' Latterly, he was more crude than
funny. His incoherent, vulgar Commons speech on sodomy, during the ''age
of consent'' debate a year ago, was perhaps the seediest low of his
career.
He appeared little in the Commons after that. Months before his death,
he was too sick to attend. Fairbairn was even excused from the
confidence debate last November. Humane consideration apart, Tory whips
no longer trusted him to vote or speak the right way.
Yet there is nothing in the papers of the late Member but jolly
anecdotes, compliments paid to his fine legal mind, affectionate
remembrance of his astonishing gifts, a polite skiting-over of his
complicated personal life. His inglorious career in government -- three
years as Solicitor-General culminated in a caddish affair and drunken
indiscretions to the press -- was minimised.
Of the drink, and of the alcoholism, there was not a mention at all.
Why?
It reflects, of course, our tendency to like drunks. They can be fun.
Of notable squiffies we collect anecdotes. ''Madam, may I have this
dance?'' mumbled George Brown in the late sixties, leering into the face
of a gloriously robed figure at some diplomatic function. ''No, Foreign
Secretary,'' came the crisp reply. ''First you're drunk. Secondly, the
band is playing the National Anthem. And third, I am the Cardinal
Archbishop of Malta.''
Barely a decade later, Lord George Brown was a sozzled nobody. His
left serious politics and joined the SDP. Shortly afterwards, papers
published a photo of the peer lying in a gutter. The party hoot died in
1985, a pitiable bore.
There is also our wont to glamorise hard drinking. This is notoriously
true of my own profession. The spirits drunk neat are as much a part of
the Bogartarian archetypal journalist as the slouch-hat, trench-coat and
untipped cigarettes. Likewise the serious author. Ernest Hemingway began
drinking because he liked the stuff; he started to drink heavily,
because it suited the image of grim masculinity he wanted to cultivate.
The day came when Hemingway could not quit. He died, almost certainly,
by his own hand.
Beyond this, too, is a kind of strange romanticism -- the attitude
that delights in lost causes, dashed hopes, eternal might-have-been. The
fumes of ethanol give failure a weird dignity. What he might have done,
but for the bottle! How high he might have flown, save for the fatal
flaw! Thus with that brilliant writer of Scots landscape, Gavin Maxwell,
lost prematurely in 1969. Biographers make much of his uneasy
homosexuality, his chain-smoking, his inability to handle money. They
tiptoe past the obvious: that Maxwell, who latterly downed two litres of
whisky a day, was a hopeless alcoholic.
Then there is plain conspiracy. It is in the nature of the habitual
drunkard that his social life is confined, more and more, to the company
of fellow drinkers. Not all his trusties, by any means, are drunkards
themselves. But the psychology of guilt, when he is finally destroyed,
drives them to denial. Nicky a lush? No way. And so I recall a gifted
Glasgow clergyman, ruined by the bottle, and how afterwards his friends
-- many of whom had shared a dram with him, some night of a Communion --
afterwards had ''hardly known him'', or ''never suspected a thing''.
Or the polymathic dentist, part of the medical establishment in a
Scottish town, whose drinking killed him -- but he died in an oncology
ward , denied all appropriate treatment for advanced cirrhosis, because
none of his colleagues would admit what was as plain as a pikestaff.
Their silence killed him. The death certificate said ''kidney failure''.
Like many doctors and dentists who die of drink, and whose colleagues
cover up, he is absent from drink-related death statistics.
None of this is an argument for teetotalism. I have seen militant
abstinence, and it does not work; children not taught sensible drinking
habits at home acquire bad ones elsewhere. I myself like drink very
much. But I am not such a fool as to think of myself immune to a future
problem. The ''disease model'' of alcoholism -- that only some
genetically disadvantaged minority develop it -- is a myth. Anyone who
drinks too much, too often, and without wisdom will become a drunkard.
That terrible disease, Aids, is not denied. Many victims in public
life have bravely come out as sufferers; such are to be admired.
Drunkenness in high places remains taboo. We in the media are well aware
of the soaks in public life. Why do we cover up for them? Celebrities
die frequently from the bottle. Why is the cause denied?
Drink is a God-given mercy. The abuse of drink is a living hell. It is
death on the roads, heartbreak in the home, ruin in affairs, duplicity
in relationship, shame and scorn in the fall. The drunken lifestyle is
far from endearing. The drunkard's death is a warning to be wailed from
the housetops. Such epitaphs as ''colourful'', ''engaging'' and
''lovable'' belittle the heartbreak wreaked in an alcoholic's life. They
pay poorly for squandered gifts and wasted talent. And they will ring
hollow, mocking, in Sir Nicholas Fairbairn's tomb.

IT IS now a month since Rolls-Royce announced the shock closure of its
engineering and customer support facility at East Kilbride. We know
that, short of a fundamental rethink, all but a handful of the 611
highly skilled jobs there will be gone by the year end. We know that the
work these people did -- but very few of their jobs -- is to be
transferred to sister RR plants at Derby and Bristol.
But with the Rolls-Royce board and senior management dug deep into a
bunker of their own making, discerning and assessing the quality of the
commercial logic behind that decision would tax the abilities of the
most inspired Kremlinologist. Apart from the usual ritual lines about
cost cutting, rationalisation and efficiency gains, the company is
publicly silent about its strategy.
More's the pity. For, in the absence of alternative explanations,
there are strong grounds for believing that this Rolls-Royce move is yet
another outbreak of the great British disease -- putting quick fixes to
meet short-term financial pressures and the voracious demands of the
investment community ahead -- far, far ahead -- of the need to invest,
long-term, in evolving technologies where Britain has, historically,
enjoyed a leading role.
No-one, not even the senior RR people who pronounced the death
sentence on East Kilbride, doubts the skills and capabilities of the
technical team there. At the smaller end of the aero engine sector,
their impressive track record stretches back to the Dart series in the
1950s; the Spey, introduced in the 1960s; and the Tay, which first flew
in 1987. Since then they have also taken responsibility for managing the
V2500 series, a multinational collaborative design.
Nor is East Kilbride a bleeding artery within the Rolls-Royce
corporate structure. Its hourly cost rates are two-thirds those at
Derby. In the financial year 1993/94, East Kilbride accounted for just
over 9% of group turnover. Its profit contribution, according to local
RR sources, was an astonishing 27.7% of sales, making it profit leader
within the group.
So why sacrifice all that now? The aerospace sector is, today, a
business where only those with the deepest pockets dare enter, where
previously solid citizens can quickly lose their shirts. The front-end
costs are daunting. The pay-back is long-term. And, despite an age of
mass air travel, the competitive pressures are such that even the market
leader, Boeing, is being shaken into lay-offs and a strategic rethink.
For many, the only answers are collaborative, multi-national, joint
ventures -- on airframes, on engine designs and, increasingly, among the
airlines as well. That way costs and risks can be shared. Joint ventures
also clear the pitch of too much competitive clutter. The same kind of
solution appeals in power generation and many other capital intensive
industries. The problem for British companies forced to play this new
global game is not to end up, every time, as the less powerful junior
partner.
Back in the late eighties, with its new long-haul engine, the Trent
series, at an advanced stage of development and its new short-haul
engine, the reliable Tay series, successfully in the air, Rolls-Royce
had to start thinking about what, if anything, would follow the Tay. In
1990, its answer was revealed -- a joint venture, with BMW of Germany.
The deal, in essence, brought together BMW and German government cash
and Rolls-Royce technology. The new company, BMW Rolls-Royce, which aims
to become the leading European supplier of small aero engines, will make
its BR700 series of engines at a new factory at Dahlewitz, south of
Berlin, in the former East Germany. That ensured that the project
receives a significant soft reuinfication loan from Bonn.
RR's contribution to this striking piece of German regional industrial
policy is technology. And a very sizeable input to that transfer of
technology is coming from East Kilbride. With the BR710 engine (already
on order to Gulfstream to the tune of 200 units) due to fly for the
first time at the end of this year, and the BR715 to follow at the
beginning of 1997, RR's Scottish workforce thought their future was
assured, for the next three years at least.
But now RR is, in effect, saying that, to solve other internal
problems -- notably the surplus technical resource at Derby now that the
Trent is flying -- it can take BR700 series design and development work
from Scotland to Derby, hand it over to new engineering teams there with
all that implies in loss of momentum on the project, and still deliver
its side of the joint venture bargain with BMW, within the original,
very tight timetable. It appears to believe it can do that, in part, by
delaying the transfer of work on the BR700 series until the very end of
this year, chopping the rest of the EK team first.
That raises some intriguing questions. Was the board of BMW
Rolls-Royce, or BMW itself for that matter, consulted about such a
dramatic shake-up in RR's design input to the BR700 programme before it
was announced? Do they approve? Can Rolls-Royce really expect the kind
of selfless devotion on the part of their East Kilbride workers implied
by a seamless transfer of work, involving no slippage in the project's
timetable. These hapless employees, after all, have just been told that,
no matter how impressive their contribution to RR in the past, they are
now surplus to requirements!
I am not suggesting, for one minute, that disgruntled RR staff in
Scotland will sabotage that transfer. But, given the atmosphere of
mistrust that last month's announcement has sown and the sheer
managerial challenge of transferring such complex activity, some delay
is surely inevitable. If I were a senior BMW executive, I would now be
questioning Rolls-Royce's ongoing commitment to the BR700 programme.
Here we have yet another British quoted company being squeezed by the
investment community for better dividend returns, almost regardless of
what that short-termism does to Rolls-Royce's grip on a technology in
which, historically, it has been justly famous. How much will be left
before we waken up to our collective folly?

I READ with dismay the comments attributed to the Scottish Football
Association, through its chief executive Jim Farry, that the deplorable
behaviour in Dublin of those who follow England's soccer team will not
affect the invitation for England to open the refurbished Hampden in
1997.
Those who remember the disgraceful scenes around Mount Florida,
Victoria Road, and other areas around Hampden will view with horror the
prospect of such mayhem being once again visited on the residents of
this area and indeed the city as a whole.
I share Mr Farry's high regard for Strathclyde police, and in
particular the officers of F division in Aikenhead Road, but I still
consider it prudent to lock my door at night. The SFA should consider it
prudent to reassess the advisability of allowing this fixture to go
ahead rather than put the resources and abilities of Strathclyde police
to the test.
Since the Scotland-England fixture was formally put to rest in 1989
the rampage of the English hooligan element has gone on unabated, a fact
to which the citizens of Malmo, Stockholm, Oslo, Rotterdam, Frankfurt,
and Dusseldorf (to name but a few) would be only too willing to testify.
The SFA is a powerful body but with all power comes responsibility. I
believe, and I know the vast majority of residents in a wide area
surrounding Hampden together with, I suspect, the greater majority of
Glasgow citizens, believe that to allow the invitation to England and
its ''fans'' to share in the opening of the refurbished national stadium
and complex -- which will, I think, embody all that is good and
forward-looking in Scottish football -- is irresponsible in the extreme.
I do not underestimate the sincerity of those at the top of the
English game who have tried to rid themselves of the blight of wanton
hooliganism, blatant racism, and abject political hatred. However, the
fact remains that they have failed to do so.
The relaxation of their exile from the European club scene recently
owes more to commercial interests and availability of sponsorship than
to a sea change in the behaviour of the worst elements of their support,
a factor obvious at both club and international level.

I WAS interested to read (Scots colleges lose out in jail contract
bids, February 15) that the principal of Stoke-on-Trent College is
quoted as saying: ''The fact that the Scottish Prison Service has
awarded the college a contract in three prisons reflects the confidence
it had in the quality of our bid.''
If this is true then it is a milestone in competitive tendering as the
normal practice is to award the contract to the lowest tenderer. It
would be interesting to know how many of the 19 invited colleges
actually submitted tenders, how they were evaluated, and the value of
each tender.

A LAHORE court's death sentence on a Christian boy of 14 and his uncle
for blaspheming Islam has brought sharp reaction from the Pakistani and
Christian communities in Scotland.
While there is absolutely no punishment at all in the Holy Qur'an for
so-called blasphemy, Salamat Massin and Rehamt Massin were found to have
written allegedly anti-Islam graffiti on a mosque wall and thrown chits
in the mosque containing blasphemous remarks.
They were tried under Pakistan's blasphemy law, enacted by the late
General Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq 11 years ago on the advice of the mullahs.
He died in a plane crash in 1988 leaving the law to be abused by
extremists for their political ends.
Most Pakistanis and Christians have been shocked to hear of the death
sentence in the name of a religion which teaches love, understanding,
and tolerance. In the face of hurtful things Allah advises patience and
tolerance.
One convert to Christianity from Sikhism, originally from Pakistan,
told me: ''The blasphemy law of Pakistan which carries a mandatory death
sentence is nonsense. You can involve anybody at any time and avenge a
personal grudge under the guise of blasphemy. There is no defence
against clerics. The law is totally wrong and unjust. It is not our
teaching to insult and offend others. It is simply a mockery of
religion.''

YOU rightly emphasise the futility of John Ellis trying to paper over
the intolerable railway agenda which ultimately drove ScotRail director
Chris Green out of an industry to which he had given a lifetime
commitment (February 18).
Mr Green's integrity and courage to speak out only confirms the
certainty of cuts and closures ahead, which every honest rail manager
knows in their heart is an inevitable outcome of this Government's
abhorrence of our railways as a public service.
Only the blind or deceitful could fail to admit how the slashing of
adequate operational support payments, and denial of vital modernisation
investment for electrification, logical reopenings, and new links --
designed to improve rail usage and efficiency -- are inexorably leading
to a shrunken and enfeebled ScotRail before AD 2000.
At least the unpopular and tottering 1960s Conservative Government had
the guts to identify its ''final solution'' for many areas by their
Beeching closure maps. The shabby approach this time round is for
Government to leave it up to individual managers to do their own
dirty-tricks betrayal as local executioners, acting on behalf of a chief
franchiser, himself ''only obeying orders'' at a convenient distance
from his railway saboteurs in the Government.
Our Secretary of State for Scotland, Ian Lang, should also perhaps
reflect on his conspicuous disinterest and refusal to use his extensive
powers to help ScotRail/Railtrack achieve the sort of improving,
expanding network sought by Scottish railway management and the accepted
norm elsewhere throughout Europe.
Very sad, too, that even that recent ministerial appointee, George
Kynoch, MP, could not bring himself to express bipartisan regret over Mr
Green's departure as a loss of leadership and vision to Scotland's
public life as well as its railways.
Only if the Government now has the courage to improve on the terms of
the present unworkable railway prospectus will the replacement of Chris
Green by John Ellis have anything to offer Scotland.

CHRIS GREEN'S resignation adds poignancy to the destruction of our

about a man of such integrity being called to Westminster to receive the
official wrist-slap for speaking the truth, and we must be warned by
this fresh evidence of political enforcement.
The objective of the proposed change is not to run a good railway
system but to make profit, even if that profit is made at the direct
expense of the travelling public in terms of cutbacks, reductions in
safety, and withdrawal of services. We should resist this privatisaton
through every means available to us.

I READ with concern the report, Minister warns lawyers to cut legal
aid costs (February 14), and wish to make three points in reply:
In Scotland 83% of all persons who receive a grant of legal aid do so
with a nil contribution, their income being assessed at income support
level. How then do they fund private legal insurance?
Most legal aid expenditure is on family law cases which are taboo to
private insurance, offering no prospect of return and heavy claims on
premiums.
In England the average cost per case is three times that of Scotland
and the cost per capita of population is twice that of Scotland.
The points made by Jonathan Aitken are a complete non-starter so far
as provision of legal services for the needy are concerned. We should be
careful that any debate on the reform of the Scottish legal aid system
should not be dragged into the debate going on south of the Border.

The A82 north of Tarbet as far as Inverarnan is as bad as you can get.
If Mr Dixon gets a 40ft trailer with any artic unit of his choice, I
challenge him to drive that section with no payload and not have
kittens.
The road is frequently blocked, and to go south needs an 80-mile
detour. In the tourist season it is strangled by caravans, etc. Scotland
needs a rail system that helps goods move safely, lets people travel
safely, and provides jobs.

THE reference by industrial correspondent Roy Rogers to Lithgow
Electronics Ltd in Greenock is inaccurate, unsettling, and grossly
misleading (February 14).
In the year ended December 31, 1994, Lithgow Electronics reached a 3%
pay settlement with its workforce, who are represented by an EETPU (AEU)
collective agreement. The company also operates a profit related pay
scheme.
Contrary to increasing ''pay'' to combat skill requirements, Lithgow
Electronics has invested heavily in the upskilling of its workforce.
We have introduced several training initiatives, including a young
adult development programme, and we provide paid day-release to any
full-time employee who wishes to pursue an electronics-related
discipline.
At a time when the electronics sector strives to increase its share of
a growing local and world market against a background of equally
intensifying international competition, I believe inaccurate reporting
does little to help the cause.
The electronics sector operates very clearly on a world stage.
Misinformation to its audience relating to key players in the sector can
only be detrimental to an important industry sector for Scotland.

WHETHER we care to admit it or not, Aids is challenging every thing:
the texture of our tolerance; our understanding of liberal behaviour;
our compassion for the victims among us; our faith in medicine, in
politicians, and our most intimate trust in each other.
Yet for some verbal assurance of ''clean health'' is no longer
sufficient. A casualness with truth has made us a litigious culture, so
much so that some couples now sign a pre-coitus contract declaring
freedom from HIV infection.
Such insistence does not say much for romance but Aids is mysterious
by nature, elusive, still lethal, and just when the medical profession
feels it has a handle on the disease the virus twists and turns and
escapes in another direction.
The other day in Geneva the World Health Organisation produced
evidence which confirmed that the pattern of the epidemic is changing.
Universally there are some 8,000,000 females affected, 50% of all new
infections being among women. In many of these instances prostitution
and drug abuse by the women themselves have set the virus raging in
their systems, although in Edinburgh, where the greater incidence of
Aids in women has been noted over several years, most females have been
contaminated by partners lost to drugs.
''This situation, in Britain at least, seems peculiar to Edinburgh,''
says a spokesman for Scottish Aids Monitor. ''It's probably because the
Aids statistics here have always been ahead of national trends.'' In
Scotland generally there are still fewer women affected than men but by
the next milennium the worldwide figure for women will have risen to 13
million. As things stand today 1,000,000 children have already been
infected.
THE most ravaged continent remains Africa where six women to every
four men are affected by HIV, their inferior status in sexual and
economic matters making them evermore vulnerable.
And in developing countries with a high incidence of HIV infection
there is a particular hazard for young females. Older men seek out
adolescent brides as they are less likely to be Aids carriers. What the
men refuse to accept, however, is that their own free-ranging sex lives
may mean their bride becomes infected anyway.
Estimates from WHO reveal that 60% of all new worldwide infections are
among 15 to 24-year-olds, with female sufferers outnumbering males two
to one.
All this, of course, may seem remote from us. In our world no-one
needs to tell an informed person how to slow the spread of Aids. That's
simple, we say: don't share hypodermic needles in the frenzied shoot-up
of drugs; don't allow any doctor to open your veins to poisoned blood;
don't pursue sex with contaminated people. But the problem with such
rudimentary advice is that we are not dealing with a society calculated
on perfection and precision, but with the faulty, self-gratifying way in
which our awkward culture works.
Many gay people may have accepted the need for monogamy, but how many
heterosexuals have examined their own lives with similar honesty?
Throughout America and Europe, as in Africa and Asia, the disease has
already produced a generation of orphans. Thousands upon thousands of
children, though not infected by the virus itself, have lost their
parents to it. By December, in New York alone, 20,000 such bereaved
youngsters will require adoption or foster care.
In the West, Aids mainly strikes people in the 25-45 age band, prime
years for child-bearing and rearing but not normally a time for dying.
The death of a parent is perhaps the worst psychological blow a young
child experiences, but when bereavement results from Aids the trauma is
heightened by stigma, secrecy, fear, anger, shame, and guilt.
Riven by heartbreak already, such families have other ago nising
issues to confront: What should relatives tell the child about a dying
mother? Do they burden the youngster with the truth which, they feel,
must never be told outside the home? Do they insist the child, however
healthy, be tested for infection? And if they explain the prognosis too
frankly are they placing that child in dread of every approaching day
believing this will be the one when his parent is found dead?
In the aftermath children may find themselves shuffled from one family
member to an other, or off-loaded on to struggling agencies who must
seek adoptive parents prepared for the difficulties which will haunt
these young innocents at the very pinnacle of human pain. So far, Aids
may seem to have taught us little that we care to know, but one thing we
should understand: it spares the sensibilities of no-one, bewildered
orphans least of all.

AT Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow it would seem that,
apparently due to fire regulations, access for disabled people is no
longer permitted except up a flight of stairs.
Despite the considerable efforts of the gallery staff it would seem
that Kelvingrove, like many other public places, has fallen victim to
fire regulations and the various ways of interpreting them following a
courtesy visit from Strathclyde Fire Service.
The situation at Kelvingrove must give a fairly dubious impression to
visitors -- surely people this city should be keen to encourage.

HOW extraordinary to see the Liberal Democrats win a vote in
Parliament because the bulk of the Conservative and Labour parties ran
away rather than face a vote on the proposal for a referendum on the
future of the European Union.
The Conservative splits on Europe are well known but the fact that the
Labour Party was too chicken to expose its own splits to the stress of
an actual vote speaks volumes about the Labour Party's own problems.
The fact that the Labour Party was prepared to let go a very realistic
chance of bringing down the Government on the issue is also extremely
interesting. The Labour Party prefers to cobble up a behind-the-stairs
deal with the Conservatives rather than risk a General Election on the
question of a European referendum.
Enormous damage has already been caused to Britain's standing in
Europe by the way the Conservative Government has dithered on the issue
under pressure from its extreme right wing. The Liberal Democrats are
entirely right in wanting to see the issue of the future of the European
Union decided by a popular vote of the people.
Apart from the effects on Britain's standing in Europe as such, it is
also clear that the Government's failure to present any leadership on
the European issue is paralysing Parliament itself.
I think people will find it hard to forgive the Labour Party for
botching such a major opportunity of going forward in support of a
European Union, which it says these days it believes in, as well as
passing up a major opportunity of getting rid of the Government.

MICHAEL TUMELTY seems to be suffering from an affliction unusual in
his profession in which expectancy exceeds critical appreciation
(February 13). The Royal SNO, as he remarks, invariably plays Russian
symphonies extraordinarily well -- Scriabin's 3rd, Glazunov's 5th, and
Rachmaninov's 2nd being superb examples.
The rendering of Prokofiev's 3rd Symphony, however, was, to my and my
guests' ears, spoilt by the over-exuberance of the brass section.
The point of the symphony is to produce a balanced striving of melody
and rhythm by the various sections of the orchestra; Alexander Lazarev
failed to control the brass and bring out the excellent contributions of
the string and woodwind sections.

FRESHENING the lipstick of a newspaper's make-up is fine. So is the
vanity of lifting its face now and again. They are like changing the
curtains of a room and shifting its furniture on a late-night whim --
all fine, except for how harder it is to find anything in the morning.
And except for the photos.
One of the stranger mysteries of the trade is how everybody's worst
enemy gets to pick the snapshot that's put in the paper. A deeper
conundrum concerns why ever were classified adverts taken off front
pages.
Always first should be personal ads, pleas for lost pets, bargains
buys, and what's on at the pictures. They are the real stuff. Temporary
lunacies of politics, Euro anguish, and such fluff should be wrapped
away inside. It was to seek a return to those good old days that the
chosen vehicle was an austere, no-smoking ScotRail rattler to Aberdeen
and the city's grand Central Library. Housed there is rarest newspaper
treasure.
Its existence surfaced in Newsplan Scotland, a survey of ancient
fourth-estate papyrus conserved in public and university libraries. Gems
saved for the nation include the Greenock Newsclout, Dollar Dumpling,
and -- yes! -- the Aberdeen Shaver.
At the start of the year a promise was made to go have a look at the
Shaver if only for its soapy title. Was it a barber-shop gazette? Did it
get into scrapes?
These good questions had slipped my mind until they changed my face.
Great reward and joy it was to find that the Aberdeen Shaver was the
most scurrilous rag ever in the North-east or possibly anywhere in the
raggle-taggle tale of local newspapers. It was a publication most foul.
Even better, that turned out to be only half the story. For in the
library are not one but two Shavers, rivals at digging dirt. They shared
a delight in catching worthy bigwigs with their trousers off. In
parallel they ran putrid campaigns to expose decadent folly.
Technically, the Aberdeen Shaver was the better muck-raker. Its
imagination was more lurid. It was well printed. When a disgruntled
apprentice left its dark ranks to start his own Aberdeen New Shaver he
used cheaper paper, more cheek, and had not learned to spell.
Both employed pens that would not be gagged to write gossip columns
with the same smart name, Razor Cuts. Defamatory items slashed the
public images of douce businessmen, greedy shopkeepers, and professional
gents in Aberdeen and roundabout. Here is a taste of the old Shaver:
We would advise a certain journeyman tailor, not 150 miles from 11
Union Street, not to go often east of the town for a drink of milk as he
has been doing of late, and be obliged to the girl before he gets there.
In a later monthly edition the paper suggested to an Arbroath
innkeeper that, if he wished to continue visiting the hammock of his
chambermaid during the night, he should shut the door.
In Montrose a burgh clerk -- described as ''a certain diminutive
personage who drives the quill in the town hall'' -- was accused of
''going at'' virgins on the links after duty hours. He was told that
filthy ballads would be written about him if he failed to desist.
And an Aberdeen pawnbroker was reported to have bairned two servant
girls one after the other. Old Sud, as the old Shaver's editor called
himself, thundered: ''We cannot do half justice to the filthy old fellow
by exposing him to the contempt of the public; 'tis a pity he is not
pitched all over and comfortably soused, heads and ears, in a
horsepond.''
Not every victim lay down (so to say) to the abuse. Probably it was
the cost of damages for libel that closed the old Shaver in 1839 and its
upstart competitor a year later. There endeth a patch of local
journalism yellow as a field of rape.
Why Shaver is not clear. When the collector of stamp duty knocked on
the doors of little papers, one dodge was to stop publication and
restart under another title. Thus old Shaver was produced by a
journalistic beauty called William Edward, who had owned, printed, and
edited a previous sheet called The Mirror. Between mirror and shaving is
a short step.
In his first issue in 1833 he gave warning: ''All such as have long
noses take care for they may depend we will not spare them in the
pinching.''
Four years later his paper was well beaten by the opposition Shaver's
rough treatment in its first issue of the death of William IV and nosy
reporting of which namely burghers had their faces most deeply in the
municipal trough to celebrate the accession of Victoria.
In its obituary the young Shaver said it mourned that King William was
no more ''not just exactly from the bottom of our hearts but merely from
the stroke of our pen''. It conceded that he had been a good sort of
fellow but fickle.
''Like all the rest of his family he had something not just sound in
the upper storey,'' the paper said.

SINCE the Replacement Windows Building Standards (Scotland)
Regulations, 1990, regulations came into effect in April, 1991,
replacement windows must comply in all respects, especially in safe
cleaning, ventilation, and means of escape where appropriate.
The onus is on home owners, who therefore should request installers to
confirm in writing that the replacement windows they propose to install
conform to the regulations.

EVER thought of hiring an MP? The latest price-list for after-dinner
speakers, issued by a London agency called Prime Performers Ltd, offers
an instant guide to what it costs.
Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont is on offer at
#3000-plus. The agency describes Peerie Norrie as ''amusing''. David
Mellor -- ''highly witty'' -- comes into the #1500 to #3000 range,
alongside Sir Bernard Ingham, Mrs Thatcher's former press secretary.
Perhaps more enlightenment about politicians and the state of the
economy would come from Cynthia Payne -- ''Famous 'Madam', amusing'' --
who is offered by Prime Performers at #1500 or less. Presumably she
still accepts luncheon vouchers.
Good Godot
KENNY Ireland of the Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh has hit on an
inspired piece of casting guaranteed to draw in the audiences. He has
chosen Sean Connery in the role of Godot in a new production of Samuel
Beckett's Waiting For Godot. Not as unlikely a prospect as you might
think, if -- like The Diary -- you didn't know that the characters in
the play talk endlessly about Godot, but that he never actually turns
up. Kenny defended the Connery casting by saying that Godot is in fact
God and that when he asked the actors they all said that Sean Connery
was God. Obviously Elvis wasn't available.
Not infra dig
ON the day Sir Nicholas Fairbairn passes away, we spot his name on an
advertising leaflet endorsing a garden fertiliser called Super-dug.
''Super-dug really is most effective and gives strength and vigour to
all our shrubs and roses,'' he says. Hope he got the chance to spend the
fee.
Dirty work
IN the ''new members'' section of the Journal of the Glasgow Chamber
of Commerce we find an entry for Maitlands Solicitors. The list of
services they offer includes ''commercial conveyancing, corporate work,
travel and holiday law, trust and excretory work, civil literature . .
.'' The bit about literature is puzzling, but what really concerns us is
this ''excretory work''. Should it be executry work? Or will Maitlands
really handle anything?
Learning curve
A BEARSDEN reader with the splendid name H. Morton Macquaker writes to
point out a fine piece of estate-agent-speak. Slater, Hogg and Howison,
trying to flog a four-storey townhouse in Belmont Crescent in the West
End of Glasgow, describe the property as being situated in a ''desirable
curved crescent''. Absolutely. All the best crescents are curved. Accept
no straight substitutes.
It's good to talk Hi-Hi again
THE spirit of Third Lanark lives on in this electronic age. Devotees
of the deceased Glasgow club can now buy the Third Lanark phone card.
The BT card is adorned by a team photo of the Hi-Hi of 1936 which
included such stalwarts as Jimmy Denmark, Jimmy Carabine, and Patsy
Gallacher. A packed terracing can be seen in the background, with fans
sporting an impressive array of bunnets.The card comes in a souvenir
folder with details of the club's founding in 1872, its early years of
success, and the years after 1905 when there wasn't so much success.
The Thirds phonecard is the brainchild of Stuart Marshall who
specialises in football programmes and cigarette cards in his
Kollectables shop at 51 Parnie Street, Glasgow. Why choose the 1936
team? ''The photograph is from a series of cards issued by Ardath
cigarettes in that year,'' said Stuart. ''With Third Lanark defunct,
there were no problems over copyright.'' Stuart's next football
phonecard will feature the Celtic team of 1936.
The cards are not cheap at #8.50, the price reflecting the fact that
it is a limited edition of 500. And you get to make five phone calls.
Comfort, no joy
IT was a bad day at Ochilview for fans of Aberdeen FC as their team
was humiliated in the Tennents Scottish Cup by Stenhousemuir. But help
was at hand. The charity collection outside the ground was in aid of the
Samaritans. We hope the Dons fans found comfort, on buying a sticky
badge, to read the words: ''The Samaritans. To help the suicidal and
despairing.''
* PRIZE for the worst pun on Tommy Steel, the Stenhousemuir chap who
scored both goals against Aberdeen, goes to Scot FM for saying that he
could turn on half a sixpence.
M8-some reeling
INSPIRED by a genuine ceilidh number called the Glasgow Square Dance
(which involves a deal of slapping and stamping) we are trying to
collect fictitious but equally appropriate jigs.
Today's dance is the Motorway Muzurka: The sequence begins with the
roads department shutting off the two outside lanes of the motorway.
Motorists form three slow-moving lines of traffic. The action consists
mainly of keeping as close to the car in front to prevent motorists in
outside lanes from cutting in front.
Male drivers may pause and wave on particularly glamorous lady
drivers. Female motorists may offer the same facility to hunky lorry
drivers but should be careful about accepting an offer of sharing his
Yorkie bar.
Young men driving BMWs and sales reps in Cavaliers and Mondeos form a
separate line on the hard shoulder and drive at 90mph to the next
motorway exit.

THE debate over Europe, and particularly on the issue of a single
currency, has reached a level of maturity which would disgrace a
kindergarten. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke attended a meeting of European
Finance Ministers yesterday with speculation rife as to whether the
Prime Minister's gagging order on the subject should extend to meetings
with the Ministers of other countries, especially if the opening debates
are relayed to journalists. In the event Mr Clarke chose to be sensible
about it and gave his firm commitment that Britain would continue to
play a constructive part in the preparations for a single currency.
Whether this enraged the Europhobes or delighted the Europhiles is
utterly irrelevant; he could do nothing else. Whether it annoyed Mr
Major, who seems to want the Cabinet children to be seen and not heard,
is of similar unimportance. Mr Clarke believes that by speaking out he
is contributing to a necessary debate and his concern is undoubtedly
correct. A properly informed debate on this country's future within
Europe is vital and must not be stopped simply because the Tory Party
cannot conduct that debate without fragmenting itself. The question of
whether Mr Clarke needed to be quite so forthright in his statement is
quite a different matter.
The Chancellor is the most convinced supporter of British
participation in Europe within the Cabinet and he may also be the
Cabinet's most powerful member at the moment. He argues with firmness
and utter common sense the position that Britain draws many benefits
from membership of the EU. Not the least of these is inward investment
which is designed specifically to exploit the wider European market. The
much-trumpeted British economic recovery depends on exports, which is
healthy. The Euro-sceptics who applaud the economic upturn carefully
avoid mentioning that 53% of British exports go to the European Union,
with 14% to North America and 4% to other leading industrialised
countries. It is reasonable to ask if that 53% could be achieved in the
future if much of Europe is trading in a single currency while we
maintain the pound sterling. Mr Clarke's basic position is that the
decision on whether Britain should participate in a single currency is
one of the most important economic policy decisions that a British
Parliament will make. It is important to note that this is a careful
attempt to present the decision on a single currency as an economic
rather than a political event. While it is true that there is a
political element as, for instance, on the question of determining
interest rates, a single currency would not by itself lead to a United
States of Europe or anything like it.
The pressure to deal with the question of a single currency on
strictly pragmatic and economic grounds and avoid the swampland of
partisan politics is building. The Governor of the Bank of England, Mr
Eddie George, will give an audience in Luxembourg that message tonight.
Quite properly, Mr George will reinforce the basic message of Maastricht
on the single currency when he emphasises the necessity of meeting the
agreed convergence criteria set down in the treaty. These state that
every country participating in a single currency arrangement must have
achieved low public debts, deficits, and inflation coupled with a stable
currency. To attempt a single currency involving countries which are out
of step on these criteria would undoubtedly be disastrous. Chancellor
Kohl of Germany agrees. Behind the scenes there are very few people who
expect any of this to be accomplished by 1997 and Mr Clarke's estimate
of 1999 at the earliest is, as with much of his contribution, simple
common sense.

GLASGOW District Council licensing committee's decision to allow
Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers to be shown in Glasgow's cinemas is
a victory for common sense. The film would have been freely available in
cinemas outside the councillors' control but within reach of those they
sought to protect from contamination, so banning it would have been a
futile gesture. But that begs the real question. Should such committees
be allowed to act as second-string censors? The British Board of Film
Censors, by giving the film an 18 certificate, decided it was fit to be
screened to adult audiences and that should be the end of the matter.
Maybe there is no need for a film censor. The board comes under attack
regularly for its decisions and sometimes its reasons for passing one
film uncut, but not another, seem perverse. Occasionally, as in the case
of this film, which should have been released last November, the board
appears to bow to ill-informed political and media pressure and delays a
decision. But the system of certification, for all its faults, can be
defended. It offers audiences guidance as to what they can expect to see
on the screen, and those issuing the certificate not only operate to a
set of guidelines but see films regularly. Licensing committees are all
too often made up of people who -- like the Heritage Secretary, Mr
Stephen Dorrell -- have difficulty in remembering when they last stepped
inside a cinema. They may not like what they see, but if they do not
know what sort of films are being made, or what cinema audiences are
prepared to accept, be it violence or nudity or simulated sex, they are
in no position to pass judgments. Stone has made a very violent film,
but behind all the excesses of taste, the brilliant editing, the flashy
technique, the cartoon sequences and the self-conscious nastiness, there
is a clear moral about the corrupting effect the news media, both
television and the tabloid press, can have on society when hell-bent on
winning ratings and increasing circulation instead of reporting straight
news.
The films banned by the licensing committee over recent decades --
Driller Killer, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Monty Python's Life of
Brian and Romper Stomper -- are a rum bunch. In hindsight, did we need
protecting from any of them? The answer, of course, is no. The first two
were cheapjack horror movies, long forgotten, and by today's standards
tame, while the Python film was at worst a harmless irreligious joke.
The problem about Romper Stomper was not excessive violence, but the
non-committal stand taken by the director towards the activities of a
gang of pro-Nazi skinheads. It did not overtly condemn their behaviour,
leaving audiences to draw their own conclusions. Do we need licensing
committees to do that on our behalf? Of course not. The district
licensing committees should let their powers to ban films wither through
non-use. They have better things to do than dictate what we may see in
the cinema.

TEN-YEAR-OLD Andrew Mackie wrote the film review column for Richmond
Park School's newspaper. ''I reviewed Forrest Gump, The Flintstones and
The Lion King,'' he said. ''I haven't seen any of them but Amanda Joyce,
who wrote the horoscope, told me all about them.''
In the words of its head teacher, Maggie Pollard, Richmond Park,
situated on the south side of Glasgow, caters for ''children of primary
age with severe physical impairments, who require daily intervention
from the medical or therapy services. Our pupils reflect a wide range of
intellectual ability and are with us for differing lengths of time. Some
come to us after failing to cope in primary, others can be integrated
into mainstream by Primary six.''
Richmond Park won a prestigious Schools Curriculum Award in 1992,
mainly for its imaginative use of new technology, and is widely
recognised as a centre of excellence in that field.
''All our children use computers every day,'' Maggie Pollard
explained. ''Everything they achieve is filed and their school record
can be taken home on disc. Technology permeates all their learning --
because of our commitment to it, we have received tremendous support
from Strathclyde region, British Telecom and the Scottish Council for
Educational Technology.''
Mari Wallace, the senior teacher who is an expert in microtechnology,
underlined its role in the learning process. ''It is not a built-on
extra,'' she insisted. ''It is the medium through which we access the
curriculum, and it gives our pupils self-esteem through their
independence in learning.''
The edition of the school newspaper for which Andrew Mackie was film
critic had to be produced in a day as part of a competition sponsored by
BT through the Campus 2000 electronic mail system. Entries were received
from schools all over the world which subscribed to Campus 2000, and
Richmond Park joined schools in Germany and Ireland among the few to
receive special commendations for the quality of their newspaper.
Mari Wallace identified three major purposes served by Campus 2000.
''It enables you to communicate on a world-wide basis. We were going to
celebrate St Andrew's Day. A school in Papa Westray in Orkney told us
how they went about it. St Andrew is also the patron saint of Greece,
and a Greek school informed us that they used to hold a celebration on
December 13.
The newspaper competition was the first one Richmond Park had entered.
In preparation the pupils brought in papers and studied their layout.
There were to be some local items, which could be planned, but they did
not know what other material would be downloaded on Campus 2000. From
the obliging picture editor of The Herald, they had received permission
to reproduce a number of photographs.
They set up their newsroom and agreed individual tasks. The newspaper
was to be produced between 9am and 3pm and this was a problem for a
school with a shorter pupil day. Nevertheless, the articles were
completed by lunchtime and the process of layout began.
The writers and designers were six able children from the senior
classes, but others helped out with other tasks. The first draft was
checked and amended, the final version polished and photocopied. The
rules stipulated that the children had to take copies home and that six
copies must be put in the post by 3.30pm. The deadline was achieved with
ample time to spare. ''You could feel the excitement,'' said Mari
Wallace, who acted as ''facilitator'' for the day.
Three reporters -- all Celtic supporters -- recalled the day with a
level of relish they cannot recently have felt elsewhere. The sports
correspondent, Paul Gillan 10, reported on Dundee v Raith Rovers.
''Campus 2000 sent us the match details,'' he said, ''and I did it in my
own words. I've never done anything like that before.''
Paul Tierney, 10, wrote the lead story, Tragic Murder in Teddington.
He admitted grudgingly, ''Writing stories is not bad, but I don't know
if I would fancy doing it all my life.''
William Bonner, 11, devised, along with Paul Gillan, an article on
Irish dancing. ''We used to have an Irish dance teacher,'' he said,
''and thought folk would like to hear about it''.
Andrew Mackie's film review provoked just one reservation from Maggie
Pollard. ''He's a wee sexist,'' she said. ''He wrote that Forrest Gump
was all right for ladies.''

SCOTTISH companies that have grasped the need to communicate
effectively in various languages and cultures will have their
achievements recognised in the National Languages For Export Campaign
Awards 1995.
It is organised by the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce on behalf of
Scottish Trade International and the Department of Trade and Industry.
For too long, too many people in the Scottish business community have
expected their European and Asian counterparts to understand and
communicate in English -- fortunately for us, they have usually obliged.
However, with the increasingly aggressive and competitive world market
place, there is no longer room for such complacency. Given the
importance to exports, this obvious weakness within the industrial and
commercial sectors is dangerous.
It would be wrong, of course, to suggest that the lack of initiative
in mastering other languages is total.
More and more companies throughout Scotland are waking up to the fact
that they must understand both the language and culture of the countries
with which they are trading if they are to survive.
The awards have been created to mark the outstanding achievements by
British companies in overcoming language and/or culture barriers in the
non-English speaking markets. They are sponsored by various business and
educational institutions in conjunction with the British Overseas Trade
Board.
There are four company awards: the BBC for Business Award, Sony United
Kingdom Ltd Award, British Airways Award, and the Unilever Award. They
go to companies that have developed the best language and/or culture
strategies.
The Open University Award is addressed to a company team or an
individual.
The National Council for Educational Technology (NCET) Award will be
presented for the best UK technologies-based product developed to assist
exporting companies with language learning or business culture training.
The Language trainer award: the European Award, is open to training
providers in European language and culture.
There are also two curriculum innovations awards. The Associated
Examining Board Award and the Arcadian Hotels Award are open to
educational or training institutions.
Entries, to be submitted by this Friday, should be addressed to Joe
McLaughlin, Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, 30 George Square, G2 1EQ.
The results will be announced, and the regional awards presented, on
March 17 at the Merchants Hall, West George Street.
The winners will go forward to the National competition on April 5, in
London, at the National Award Ceremony.
* IN another Languages for Export initiative, Glasgow Chamber of
Commerce, in association with the China-Britain Trade Group, is to
launch its first Chinese business course.
This 10-week course, which will supply a basic grounding in Mandarin
Chinese, has been so well subscribed that plans are already under way
for a second course.

THE launch of the Higher Still Development Programme last month hit
public attention with all the impact of the first snowdrop of the year,
engulfed by a blizzard -- the snowjob being none other than the school
attendance statistics published on the same day, to far greater media
interest.
Does it matter? After all, even before the Howie Report, talk of
tinkering with traditional Scottish Highers had met with as much
enthusiasm as that accorded to the avalanche of school statistics. Even
if one accepts Howie's diagnosis, as many did, that the status quo is
not an option for fifth and sixth years of secondary schooling, now when
teachers are buckling under workload pressures and the entire education
system is threatened with upheaval in the wake of local government
reform, is this the right time for more change?
As a parent of two sons who have gone through fifth and sixth years
and a third currently making that transition, I became one of those who
accepted the Howie diagnosis, but not its prescription. The inevitable
corollary, therefore, was that if the status quo was not serving the
interests of the majority of upper secondary pupils, developing a system
which would do so became an urgent priority.
The Higher Still proposals were understandably criticised on a number
of points, but nevertheless arguably represented the bare bones of a
scheme which, with goodwill all round, could fit the bill.
A leading question was who would be commandeered to flesh out the
skeletal structure. Departing from the usual procedure, the Scottish
Office plumped not just for some of the usual suspects among the Great
and the Good, but also to recruit at the grassroots. Presumably that is
why I find myself on one of the task groups.
I am not alone among committee members in being more often than not a
stern critic of government initiatives. Equally, we are all aware that
the mere fact of being invited to participate does not make us
representative of grassroots opinion in the sectors from which we come
-- professional, employer, or in my case, parental -- nor do we de facto
confer credibility on the process, whatever our good intentions.
And what are those good intentions? Mainly to help the current system
evolve into a unified and effective post-16 certification structure
common to all school-leavers (see panel). Key concerns about retaining
the traditional breadth of Highers, bridging the academic-vocational
divide, providing continuity in students' current studies and minimising
disruption in the teaching environment are guiding principles for all
task group members.
It is evolution that is being proposed, not revolution. As far as the
workload issue is concerned, it could be that drawing together the
fragmented elements with which teachers currently cope -- including
Highers, Scotvec awards, and General Scottish Vocational Certificates --
and removing some of the duplication may provide some workload relief.
Such an assertion, however, can only be verified by teachers themselves,
so recent indications that the Educ ational Institute of Scotland might
take a more active role in Higher Still deliberations are most welcome.
One question that pops up time and again, not least among group
members as we race to comply with the latest deadline, is the timetable
for implementation. What would an extra year, or even two, matter, if it
gave everyone more breathing space?
I can only speak for myself in accepting that if humanly possible the
proposed schedule, whereby final course documents for 1997/98 would be
published in mid-1996, should be met.
This is not just to restate the urgency of meeting youngsters' needs.
It is because the successful co-ordination of curriculum changes in the
past, such as Standard Grade and the 5-14 Programme, owes much to the
co-operation and expertise of the 12 Scottish local education
authorities.
The prospect of 32 mainly new councils, composed largely of former
district councillors (a statistical certainty) without experience of
running an education service -- still less the benefit of professional
advice, if they choose to dispense with Education Directors and
Committees -- is not conducive to a smooth transition in the future. Any
postponement in the Higher Still deadline should be seen against that
backdrop.
It is surely better to take advantage of the assembled expertise
seconded from local authorities to the subject specialist groups to
maximise progress in the time available.
To do so would not be to support a hasty approach to the various key
decisions yet to be addressed during the development programme, nor to
underestimate the enormous task ahead, but to recognise that everyone
with a vested interest in ensuring that the end product works and works
well should do our utmost to achieve that result.
WHY CHANGE?
To provide:
* relevant courses for all post-16 students
* the prospect of recognised qualifications for all post-16 students
* a more even work demand throughout secondary education
* better preparation for work and higher education
* further development of core skills
* a unified assessment and qualifications system
* unified academic and vocational qualifications
All leading to . . .
* higher standards of attainment
* balanced and broad attainment
Diana Daly is a member of the Higher Still information and publicity
task group, seconded from the executive board of the Scottish Parent
Teacher Council.

A QUIET life spent in wellies and mud, potting plants and trimming a
grass verge to knife-edge perfection, is the common perception of a
career in horitculture. Today, however, the horticulturalist is in great
demand all over the world, his or her particular knowledge and skills
increasingly sought to help solve pressing global problems.
In social and environmental areas such as health, pollution, crop
production or the conservation of plant species, the horticulturalist
can help provide a solution to a problem by means of his or her
understanding of plants.
Would-be horticulturalists need to be able to cope with the demands of
a changing world and an increasingly complex field of work. Yet first
and foremost they must be prepared to work hard, and want to learn about
plants.
''The horticulturalist is devoted to plants in the same way as the vet
is to animals,'' says Professor Geoffrey Dixon, head of Auchincruive
Agricultural College near Ayr. ''You must have a curiosity about how
plants grow and how they can be used, whether it's within an ecology or
within a design, as opposed to the botanist who wants to know how and
why plants work.''
Auchincruive is the most comprehensive agricultural college in the UK,
offering a range of courses in horticulture. Previously the Scottish
Agricultural College (SAC), Auchincruive has a flexible approach as
regards qualifications and experience, and is very keen to encourage
mature applicants. The courses are structured to cater for a range of
differing needs.
A diploma or degree from Auchincruive could set you off on a career
full of variety and opportunity. ''The sky's the limit,'' claims
Professor Dixon, ''in work opportunities and salaries. There's a whole
raft of developing, diverse areas in horticulture''.
He added: ''You could go into production which includes field crops,
fruit, nurseries or glasshouses. There's environmental landscaping, such
as in housing schemes, an increasingly important strand of social
horticulture. It's just beginning to emerge that plants play an enormous
part in the way people behave. Psychologically, they become more
amenable, there is less vandalism and violence. Another area is health,
where people are beginning to realise the benefits of eating the produce
of horticulture.''
Or you could become a world-renowned horticultural landscaper of, for
example, golf courses. ''At that level,'' says Professor Dixon, ''people
pay whatever you ask''. Auchincruive has strong European links through
ERASMUS, the student programme which allows students to move easily
between colleges and universities throughout the EC.
A career in horticulture can land you in unexpected places. One
graduate from Auchincruive with an interest in plant conservation
managed to find work with the Flora and Fauna Preservation Society in
Turkey, on a scheme to help Turkish peasants grow a disappearing species
of cyclamen.
An alternative route to a career in horticulture is through an
apprenticeship on a local authority training programme. Glasgow Parks
and Recreation Department's Skillseekers apprenticeship programmes last
three years, and lead to possible full-time employment as a
horticulturalist in one of the city's 70 or so parks, golf courses,
football pitches, nurseries, or other council amenities.
Dedication and an enthusiasm for horticulture are the keys to securing
a place on the apprenticeship programme, and ultimate employment,
advises the department's senior training officer, Sharon Caskie. An
extremely popular training sheme, it offers a wage that compares
favourably with other apprenticeships. Each year, around 200 would-be
horticulturalists compete for 15 or so placements. But some apprentices
find themselves unprepared for the realities of the job.
Says Ms Caskie: ''It's hard work, especially in wintertime, and people
do drop out if they haven't thought out quite what the job entails. Last
year we introduced three days of work experience before selection to the
training programme, to allow applicants to work alongside apprentices.
It gives both sides a chance to see if individuals are suited to the
job.''
Susan Boyd, 21, completed her apprenticeship last year and now works
as a horticulturalist at Pollok Country Park. She clearly loves her job
but agrees that dedication and hard work are vital. ''You can be outside
in the pouring rain and freezing in the winter. But you also get a lot
of job satisfaction in seeing the plants develop, getting a project
finished and seeing the end product.''
Susan is now studying for an HNC in Amenity Horticultural Management,
and would like to see more women apply for what is still seen as a
traditionally male area. ''There's nothing to stop a woman being
successful, nothing in the job that she can't do. As more women start to
work in horticulture, it's less likely you'll be on your own among a
bunch of men.''
Another former apprentice, Paul Brannan, 23, has chosen to specialise
in golf course management and is currently studying for an HNC in the
subject while working at Lethamhill Golf Course. He believes his
apprenticeship gave him excellent training on which to base a career.
''It was very varied, gave you a feel of everything before you decided
what area you enjoyed most and wanted to specialise in.''
Reciting a list of horticultural apprentices who have climbed to the
top of their careers, Sharon Caskie has every hope for her two former
trainees. ''These two young people should have every expectation that
they too can go to the very top.''
* For further information on courses in horticulture at Auchincruive
Agricultural College, contact Professor G Dixon (telephone 0292 520331).
Local careers offices have information on horticultural apprenticeships.
Recruitment takes place in April.

FINALLY, after hiding for years behind the impending trial, refusing
all comment, George Esson, a former chief constable involved with the
Lockerbie investigation, has commented to your newspaper. I have a few
observations to make on his remarks, as reported, and a few questions.
A first observation: I understand that Mr Esson joined the
investigation in the summer of 1989 and was not in Lockerbie in those
first terrible 10 days. He might not be aware of the tampering with and
removal of evidence by the scores of Americans who were on the site
within three hours.
A first question: did the Scottish police ever interview Marwin
Kreesat in Jordan and did they know he was an asset of several secret
services including the CIA?
What we say in The Maltese Double Cross -- that Kreesat has admitted
he was a secret agent, had made airplane bombs for a Syrian-connected
terrorist, was sent on a revenge mission to Germany, and left three or
four airplane bombs behind -- is documented in statements made by him.
One of the bombs Kreesat left behind in a town near Frankfurt killed
the top German bomb expert when he attempted to defuse it six months
after Kreesat had been released and had fled to Jordan. That's how good
his bombs were. That, on my understanding of the law, makes Mr Kreesat
guilty at least of manslaughter. This was after Lockerbie, so there is
no doubt there were sophisticated airplane bombs near Frankfurt, the
city from where the flight departed. Mr Esson states that there was no
evidence against Kreesat.
The Ghanadafar confession Mr Esson alludes to (Ghanadafar was a member
of Kreesat's cell) which appeared in the Telegraph, is a translation of
the actual confession made to the German BKA. If, in fact, the Scottish
police did interview Ghanadafar, perhaps he told them something
different. Did he tell them he was a tourist?
The two forensic experts so highly praised in your article, Dr Hays
and Mr Fereday, as we reveal in the film, have been involved in
terrorist cases including the MacGuire case which have been overturned
on appeal.
The famous timers only the Libyans were supposed to have and allegedly
used in the bomb were, in fact, in the possesion of other countries
including East Germany. Its secret service, the Stasi, had them, with
its close connections to the Syrians, Iranians, and Palestinian groups.
This was confirmed both by the man who sold the timers, Edwin Bollier,
and by his Stasi control.
Can Mr Esson tell us who it was -- Americans from the FBI and CIA --
who provided the Scottish authorities with information on the timers?
Does Mr Esson know anything of the background of the Americans,
including Mr Vincent Cannistraro of the CIA, who would have provided the
information?
As for the identification of a Libyan as the man who bought Maltese
clothes, as we state in The Maltese Double Cross, the Maltese
shopkeeper, Tony Gauci, made 18 separate and contradictory statements
when asked to identify the clothes buyer.
Shown a photograph of a man named Abu Talb, who had Maltese clothes in
his house in Upsala, Sweden (as revealed by his wife in the film), when
he was detained, Gauci identified Talb as the possible buyer, but never
definitely.
I talked to Gauci in Malta, and could have got him to say anything I
wanted but did not persist in trying to interview him on film because
whatever he would say today he could contradict tomorrow. The recent
File on Four programme effectively demolished the Malta clothes
connection using Gauci's own statements.
Again, as we reveal in The Maltese Double Cross, there is no document
showing an unaccompanied bag transferred from an Air Malta flight on to
PanAm 103. Air Malta won a libel suit presented before the High Court
against Granada Television and the Independent after the newspaper and
broadcaster stated that such a bag had been transferred.
There are facts which are beyond dispute:
* There was an airplane bomb-maker in Germany and a network in place
in 1988 and into 1989 all under surveillance, several members of which
were actually secret agents.
* We discovered that, in fact, there were overlapping networks, and
that members of the overlapping network are still in place in Germany
today, some of them now German citizens.
* There was a man in Sweden, in a city where there were terrorists who
had connections to the German network. This man, Abu Talb, as the
Scottish police knew in the summer of 1989, had clothes from Malta and
had been in Cyprus in the fall of 1988.
* What we reveal in the film, partly through interviews with members
of the family of the young man who, we believe, brought the bomb on to
the plane, partly as confirmed through other sources, is that this drug
courier duped into taking the bomb on the plane had been in Sweden and
had been given Maltese clothes by Abu Talb.
I understand Mr Esson is now retired from the investigation. Rather
than indulge in public relations exercises, perhaps it is time the
authorities tried to confirm or refute with facts the information we and
others have revealed.
The United Kingdom has given us Sherlock Holmes and Scotland Yard.
Could it be that the authorities, after having stumbled over prime
suspects time after time, by continuing to respond in the way they have,
hope they are not in the end going to fall flat on their faces?
I have a proposal to make. Perhaps now that Mr Esson is retired Helen
Mirren could work on the case. We will offer her our full co-operation,
as we have to those in the Scottish police still willing to investigate.
* Investigative journalist Allan Francovich made the documentary film
The Maltese Double Cross which challenges the official view held by the
British and US that two Libyan secret agents planted the Flight 103
bomb.

The final date for submissions to the Scottish Commission on Education
is approaching fast. Dick Louden, the secretary, reports on the progress
of work and the evidence gathered
THE Commission on Scottish Education has now held four formal meetings
and taken steps to collect as wide a range of evidence as possible.
In this context, it may be useful to look at the stage of progress
achieved by the parent body, the National Commission on Education, whose
remit was to make proposals for education and training in the United
Kingdom over the next 25 years.
The National Commission published the major report of its findings,
Learning to Succeed, just over a year ago, and thereafter received
additional funding to carry out follow-up work. It has now identified
the following issues as key priorities:
* QUALIFICATIONS in the upper secondary school
* FUNDING of further and higher education
* SCHOOL effectiveness
* PRE-FIVE and early years education.
In pursuit of school effectiveness -- which in recent months we have
featured several times in The Herald in relation to the so-called
''value-added'' element that schools offer -- the National Commission
has set up a project called Success Against The Odds.
In this, 12 teams of three members (only one of whom is directly
involved in education) will conduct case studies of schools in deprived
areas which have proved successful.
One of these teams is led by Professor John MacBeath of the Quality in
Education Centre at Strathclyde University. The Scottish Commission has
now also had a meeting with Professor MacBeath and the associate
director of QIE, Dr Brian Boyd, on the issue of school effectiveness.
The areas selected for further study by the National Commission are
also clearly of great interest to the Scottish body.
In preparing a list of topics on which to invite submissions, we took
care to ensure that all sectors of the education service were
represented.
But in our early discussions it became apparent that, like the
National Commission, we could readily draw out a number of priorities
that might be the main focus of our attention.
In fact, including school effectiveness, our priority areas closely
resemble those identified by the National Commission:
* SCHOOL qualifications
* SCHOOLS in disadvantaged areas
* POST-16 education and training.
This does not, of course, mean that we intend to ignore other facets
of education such as 5-14 and the pre-five and community education
services. The value we attach to them will be reflected in our final
report.
However, as a body with limited resources and operating to a limited
timescale, we have to define our focus and are assisted in this by the
knowledge that Learning to Succeed already offers an admirable analysis
of services such as pre-five education, including evidence collated from
Scottish sources.
We will take a close look at developments in further and higher
education.
The new independence of further education colleges has released them
into the open market, and we will be interested in the implications of
their recruitment policies for staying-on rates in the secondary school,
especially as some qualifications are available in both types of
institution.
We will examine the role of the Scottish Higher Education Funding
Council and its influence on university finances, student intake levels,
and teaching quality.
In view of the growing unease about student poverty, we will want to
look closely at the student loans scheme. Members of the Commission are
studying submissions as they arrive, and are also arranging meetings
with key figures in Scottish education in order to complement the
evidence which is being received.
Between Easter and summer, we hope to hold four large-scale hearings
in different parts of the country, consulting parents, consumers of the
service, and professionals.
By the end of that process, we should be ready to consider in depth
the future needs of the Scottish education system, and the expectations
of those who depend on it.

GEORGE HUME wonders why people who should know better speak in haste
and repent at leisure
MARIE Antoinette doubtless spoke from the heart if not with any great
perception of the public's anger when she suggested that the poor of
Paris eat cake to assuage their breadless hunger. Scarcely were the
words fallen from her lips, almost before Robespierre could say knife,
and the starving masses determined that the most suitable vehicle for
her humour was the tumbril. Heads rolled. Revolutionaries ten - silly
quips nil.
To save himself from being dragged to Revolution Square by snow
petalled and leaf stuck commuters on the 07.35 from Penge, Transport
Minister Norris decided on a repeat performance of opening his lips
before shifting his mental apparatus into gear. Within just hours of
describing those who travel on public transport as ''dreadful human
beings,'' he declared without any great fear of contradiction: ''I am a
pompous prat.'' The protection afforded by this admission - the natural
reluctance on the part of all decent citizens to attack the
feeble-minded - may not last through the next General Election.
Former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart, who carries the Tory
banner of law and order in Eastwood, put his green welly in his mouth
this month when he went for a walk in Pollok Castle Wood, spotted a
pickaxe and picked it up in order, he explained in the tone of one who
expects to be believed, that others would not. After which, without the
help of a Robespierre and in idiosyncratic variation on the norm, he
fell upon it.
''Crisis, what crisis?'' uttered at Heathrow Airport on his return
from a summit at Guadeloupe in 1979 put paid to the ability of Jim
Callaghan to convince the electorate that he had a firm grip while Enoch
Powell's ''Rivers of Blood'' remark drowned his political career.
''Economical with the truth'' spoke volumes to the nation about the
integrity of senior civil servant Sir Robert Armstrong while ''Slitty
Eyes'' only reinforced the view held by many that the Duke of Edinburgh
enjoys life's not inconsiderable luxuries purely and simply because,
though a subject, he is the object in ''my husband and I.''
Air Chief Marshall Sir Sandy Wilson, a student of fine fabrics and
good furniture, issued what may yet prove to be a regretted
tuppence-worth when he was sacked as Commander in Chief RAF Training and
Personnel after spending a king's ransom titivating official residences
here and in Germany. Seeking to give the impression of a controlled jump
rather than a parachuteless plunge, he said: ''I have taken this step in
the hope that it will relieve pressure on my Service and my family'' . .
. a unique approach to getting one's jotters.
But the line taken by the hitherto obscure Mr Ed Wallis when
challenged about his #1.2 million in share options on top of his
#350,000 salary as chief executive of PowerGen is the wee gem that will
have stuck most firmly in the nation's collective mind, most readily
have brought the normally tranquil and even tempered to the point of
apoplexy.
Asked whether he was worth the money, Mr Wallis said: ''Yes, I think I
am worth what I'm paid. Yes, of course I am.'' This brings us back very
nearly full circle to Marie-Antoinette's asinine remark about cake for
the masses. Cosseted in the Palace of Versailles, it was possibly not
easy to understand that when one cannot afford even sliced white it is
to add insult to injury to be directed to a diet of what Glasgow's
celebrated linguist, the late Jack House, rejoiced in calling Gatoox.
One would have imagined, however, even in these only slightly more
egalitarian times, that Mr Wallis, notwithstanding the remote grandeur
of the chief exec's office at PowerGen, would have a slightly firmer
grip on reality and the perceptions of the poor, even just the
ordinarily rewarded . . . the kind of folk who might innocently board a
bus or a train only to discover that they are ''dreadful human beings.''
Why, one wonders, do they do it - speak in haste and repent at
leisure? Is it fear, nerves or arrogance? Could it be that a new
generation of journalists who have learned at the knee of the
rough-and-tumble Mr Paxman are giving those with Cabinet post and
official residence a run for our money? Or is it just that power
corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely?
Now junior minister Charles Wardle has joined the ranks of the
outspoken, possibly before engaging his brain but certainly not prior to
sending a Dear John letter to dear John, quitting his post at the
Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Wardle may know something about the
quality of life, opportunity and care in this country that has so far
eluded the notice of the masses and thus, on the question of open
frontiers with Europe and notwithstanding an assurance from the EU that
Britain can maintain its immigration controls, Mr Wardle had this to
say: ''We simply cannot afford an influx of economic migrants freely
walking into this country without so much as a by-your-leave.''
Given the nature of some already here - prone to speak first and think
second, if at all - what on earth can Mr Wardle be worried about? Let
him eat cake.

IT IS five years since that sunny early spring afternoon in Gibraltar
when the SAS shot and killed three members of the IRA (Sean Savage,
Mairead Farrell and Daniel McCann) as they were preparing to plant a
bomb designed to cause mayhem among soldiers and tourists at the
changing-the-guard ceremony. Yesterday, 19 judges of the European Human
Rights Court in Strasbourg heard the claim of the parents of the three
dead terrorists that their shooting was a violation of their ''right to
life'' under the European Human Rights Convention.
So much has happened since then and so many myths have grown up around
the shootings that it is worth rehearsing the bare bones of the story.
In a classic undercover operation, the security services learned that
the IRA was planning ''a spectacular'' and they followed the ''active
service unit'' to the south of Spain.
The SAS was brought in as the Gibraltar police are not trained for
this type of operation. After some confusion at the border, the SAS
picked up the IRA trail in the busy streets of the Rock. Then, according
to the SAS, fearing that the terrorists had already planted their bomb
and were carrying a radio-controlled detonator and believing they were
armed, the soldiers shouted challenges and opened fire.
The opposing version of events, heard in Strasbourg yesterday, was
that the soldiers opened fire without warning in accordance with a
policy of ''shoot-to-kill''. Certainly no weapons were found on the dead
terrorists and the car thought to contain the bomb was found to be
''clean''. However, a couple of days later, the Spanish police found
another car used by the gang containing 145lbs of Semtex equipped with a
time device set to go off at 11.20, which would have coincided with the
changing-the-guard ceremony on the day after the shootings.
There were two reactions to the affair. The first was that the
terrorists got what they richly deserved and that it was all handled
with splendid expertise by the SAS. The other was summed up by a
parliamentary motion sponsored by Mr Eric Heffer and signed by 60 Labour
MPs accusing the SAS of terrorism. Their action, said the motion, was
''tantamount to capital punishment without trial''.
There followed the television documentary Death on the Rock which
caused a tremendous furore by virtually accusing the SAS of murder and
creating the impression that the terrorists were innocent when even the
IRA publicity department acknowledged they were ''on active service''.
The SAS has always been viewed with mistrust by liberal circles in
Britain. John le Carre summed up this feeling when the regiment first
came to the notice of the general public when they stormed the Iranian
Embassy in London after it had been occupied by terrorists in May 1980.
He wrote: ''Before our very eyes the sleeping psychopath in all of us
was called to arms, institutionalised, dressed in black and licensed to
kill . . . theirs is scarcely the courage of the untrained passer-by who
'has a go' at a thug. It is the courage of the thug put to social use .
. .''
The fact is that the Special Air Service is a regular regiment of the
British Army. Its members are very carefully chosen, highly disciplined
and specially trained to protect the nation in wartime and peacetime.
And it is here that we come to the crunch, for under the impact of
modern terrorism the line between war and peace has become blurred. The
soldiers who operated on the Rock and stormed the Iranian embassy were
subject to military discipline, and carried out what amounted to
military actions but they were not at war, they were acting in aid of
the civil power and were subject to civilian laws.
If the Government had declared war officially on the IRA, the
situation for the soldiers in Gibraltar and in Northern Ireland would be
much more clear-cut. Members of the IRA would be ''the Queen's enemies''
and could be legitimately shot on sight. But for good political reasons
successive governments have refused to declare war. It would have meant
recognising the IRA as a sovereign power and treating captured members
as prisoners of war. The IRA would have liked nothing better.
But this places a tremendous burden on the invidiual soldiers involved
in counter-terrorist operations. That burden has been borne particularly
by the SAS because it is tasked to carry out the special operations
resulting from intelligence. But other soldiers, less able to carry the
burden, have also been caught up in this dilemma. Certainly Private
Clegg of the Parachute Regiment would not be serving a life sentence for
murder if war had been declared on the IRA.
The IRA has taken advantage of this dilemma, acting as if it were at
war, shooting and bombing its chosen targets without mercy, but rushing
to law when its members' ''civil rights'' are abused.
The shootings on the Rock have already been tested twice in courts of
law. The inquest jury in Gibraltar found by a majority of 9-2 that the
terrorists had been ''lawfully killed''. A year ago the European
Commission on Human Rights decided by 11-6 that the SAS men did not
violate Article 2 of the European Convention that protects the ''right
to life''.
However, the Commission also decided to refer the case to its superior
body, the European Court. The court normally follows the opinions of the
Commission. But if the Court decides in favour of the dead terrorists'
parents the British Government may be ordered to pay them compensation.
It is here that we go galloping into Cloud Cuckoo Land. Surely it is
against all natural justice that compensation should be paid for the
death of three terrorists who had set out to kill as many innocent
people as possible and brought about their own deaths by their terrorist
actions. Would the next demand be for the SAS soldiers to be charged
with murder?

DOCTOR SUSAN GREENFIELD attracted a lot of attention recently when she
gave the prestigious Royal Institution Science lectures. Not only was
she the first woman to take on the challenge, she also came to science
in an unorthodox way.
Instead of specialising in science at school, Dr Greenfield took A
Levels in Greek, Latin, and Ancient History before gaining a degree in
Psychology at university.
Far from seeing these school subjects as irrelevant, as many so
mistakingly do today, she was inspired by them. Indeed, Dr Greenfield is
now looked on as a Renaissance Woman because of the wide range of her
talents and interests.
Moreover James Dyson, one of Britain's most successful inventors --
the ubiquitous Ballbarrow and the latest Dual Cyclone vacuum cleaner
that doesn't need a bag -- also studied Classics at school before going
to the Royal College of Art. Yet he managed to become a top engineer and
designer.
Too often pupils are discouraged from studying Classics on the grounds
that Greek and Latin are not as ''useful'' as other ''modern'' subjects.
''What's the point of studying Latin and Greek?'' How often have I
been asked that irritating question? Perhaps the examples of Dr
Greenfield and James Dyson will encourage people to take a more
enlightened and flexible view of education.
Besides which, there is a growing need for adaptability in the
workplace. It is less and less the case that people train for one job
and never have to retrain either in the same job or in some other field.
And the notion of personal transferable skills, often denigrated in
the last few years, has now come back into vogue. This is the idea that
the solid skills acquired in learning such subjects as Classics can be
applied to the learning of other things.
My brother, for example, specialised in history and philosophy at
university and now runs his own computer business.
So a solid general education can provide the skills necessary for
adaptability, while at the same time opening up the mind to new ideas
and encouraging independence of thought.
Greek especially ought to be studied more widely than it is at
present. Certainly it is a challenging subject, but that is all the more
reason for studying it.
In fact, it is time that the term ''educationally challenged'' was
used once more in its correct sense. It is a good thing to be
educationally challenged.
The Greek alphabet is not hard to master after a few basic exercises,
and I have found that pupils generally enjoy learning something new and
different.
Very early on they realise how many English words are derived from
Greek, especially technical terms. Did you know that encephalography
involves the analysis of X-ray photographs of the brain?
Neither did I, until I came across it in the dictionary; but I
recognise the Greek words ''en,'' ''cephale'' and ''grapho'', and that
helps me to understand the meaning.
It is so often back to ancient Greek that we go to invent new terms.
The film Arachnophobia owes its title to the Greeks, while
''discotheque'' can also be traced back to its ancient roots, although
what Socrates would have made of the gyrating bodies and flashing lights
we'll never know.
A knowledge of Greek can also help with spelling. We all know the
problems that ''diarrhoea'' can cause and you can blame the Greeks for
that, as you can for a whole host of other ailments.
However, they have also given us the word ''therapy'' -- the twentieth
century answer to most of our difficulties. So Greek, like Latin, can
strengthen your English vocabulary.
But the real joy of learning Greek is that it opens up a vast treasury
of some of the finest writing in European literature.
Homer's Iliad and Odyssey are the oldest surviving works of western
poetry, going back to the eighth century BC and, for me, the greatest.
To be able to read even just a few hundred lines of Homer makes the
learning of Greek worthwhile. They are excellent stories, still popular
today, told in a simple yet noble way, full of the rhythms and sounds of
wonderful verse.
The Scottish Examination Board now offers Short Courses in Greek to
supplement the existing courses at Standard Grade, Higher and Sixth
Year. You can also begin Greek from scratch at university.
So you have no excuses. Be bold, be brave, be linguistically
challenged!
* ALLAN MILLIGAN, head of Classics at St Columba's School, Kilmacolm,
is also chairman of the Association of Teachers of Classics, although he
has written this article in a personal capacity.

Since last December there has been high dudgeon in Dundee over an
innovative proposal to rehabilitate vulnerable families in St. Mary's
housing scheme. Tomorrow, officials behind the project will meet
representatives of the local community in an attempt to calm the climate
of outrage. But will fury persist, or reasoned debate prevail? Anne
Simpson
has been taking the temperatures
The perimeter fence, for example, has now entered St. Mary's folklore
as an eight-foot barricade with spikes
Councillor Borthwick has scared the community by making out we are
putting people in a unit like Barlinnie
THIS is a story about security, full of pitfalls, confusing
implications and myths. It centres on Dundee but its echo lands on any
place where the dislodged become disowned. It is a tale of disaffection.
A tract for our times.
Just before last Christmas, plans were activated in Dundee to place
four homeless families inside controlled, refurbished property in the
city's St Mary's housing scheme. For several years the proposal had been
under consideration, nothing fractious hindering its progress through
the various local government committees. But now, with the disclosure of
its precise location, the ructions have begun.
By those who condemn the project as punitive, a ghetto to corral and
brand the needy, much noise is raised over its use of watchdog cameras,
its reinforced glass and steel perimeter fencing and, expressed in these
bald terms such attributes do suggest the gulag school of architecture
is once more in the ascendant. But anyone picking through this story
quickly finds that rumour has done its worst.
St Mary's is sprawling domestic territory at the foot of the Sidlaw
Hills, harled housing running next to wood-framed houses and
colour-washed residences with the new windows and miniature ''Georgian''
doors that are the badges of homes purchased from the council. Just at
the edge of the estate, not far from Catto Country Park, there is St
Clement's Terrace, again with the same mix of properties; the two-tone
doorbell next to the graffitied close.
The fuss is pinned on No 7, a nondescript unit of apartments in a
three-storey block, which stands in a dead end -- and now even that may
be held against it. The essential facts are these: in conjunction with
Tayside social work department and Dundee District Council, the charity
National Children's Home/ Action for Children will operate a #1 million
pioneering programme to turn ''suitcase'' families into model
neighbours, their development being supervised continually by live-in
counsellors. Three-quarters of the money involved will come from the
Scottish Office, the rest from the local authorities. But who are the
suitcase families? It is at this point that misunderstanding and
mischief take hold.
Because of inept consultation with St Mary's in the first place, the
word among the locals is that their scheme is to be ''dumped on by
riff-raff once again.'' So, now there are two arms of protest poised for
action: one vaguely philosophical, insisting that the whole proposal is
no better than an open prison; the other, maligning the incomers -- as
yet unknown -- and packed with Not-In-My-Backyard vexation. Embracing
both arguments there is Councillor Ian Borthwick (Independent Labour,
representative of St Mary's for more than 30 years, and latter-day
obstructionist). ''High palisaded fencing, a 10.30pm curfew, four
security cameras and armoured glass ... and they try to tell us all this
is necessary to rehabilitate vulnerable families,'' he says, hammering
out the words with disbelief. ''In my view none of these features are
conducive to that.''
But the subtext to Councillor Borthwick's outrage concerns another
interpretation of security, the security of those already living in the
designated area. Along St Clement's Terrace the spectre of marauding
interlopers is haunting people's judgment. ''Mine's a good community,''
says Borthwick, ''but because of what's happened to it in the past 10
years it's a fragile one and could go either way. I'm not down on folk,
especially children, being given another chance, but this isn't a
suitable project for a housing scheme. By placing it in St Mary's they
are treating the residents like second-class citizens.''
At NCH Action for Children, Colin Flinn battles against the wall of
misinformation. The suitcase families in question will not be
anti-social tenants, he says. Not people whose prime difficulties are
rooted in crime, drugs, and alcohol. But they will be people whose lives
have been hijacked by poverty, throwing them into the sullen
accommodation of bed-and-breakfast land.
''They will be families already undergoing counselling with us and
each will sign a contract committing them to obeying the project's
rules. These are not draconian but basically the same as those operating
in many stopover programmes. They are there to help people become better
citizens,'' he insists. Should any of the participants drastically break
this code of behaviour they will be dispatched back into the system
whence they came. The argument that the whole concept is merely a
barracks for rejects is resolutely dismissed by Flinn. Clearly, the
first public communications about the venture were not thought through
and as a result they were handled badly by the authorities, allowing
Councillor Borthwick to claim the moral high ground.
Illness prevented Flinn from attending that initial public meeting in
December, but he understands it was disastrous, worry and prejudice
distoring the project's features almost beyond recognition. That
perimeter fence, for instance, has now entered St Mary's folklore as an
eight foot high steel barricade with spikes. ''Okay, I can sympathise
with people's concerns,'' says Flinn, ''but for the benefit of those who
are misinformed let's go through the unit's facilities. The fence is
mesh, five feet high, rounded at the top, and it will extend around No 7
where the grass acts as a play area for children. It will keep dogs out,
but its main purpose is to meet our responsilities to small children. We
have to ensure they don't run off into the road.''
There will be no armoured glass but on the ground floor, the office
area, reinforced glass will be used in the windows to protect personal
files and costly computer equipment.
A trained counselling staff will live on-site, but Flinn insists that
it is wrong to talk about curfews. ''In common with other live-in
programmes, there won't be free coming and going. A concierge
arrangement will be in operation with keys handed in, and if families
are to arrive back late this would have to be discussed in advance with
the staff.'' Habitual bad timekeeping will not be tolerated.
But there is such scorching anger within the community that no amount
of reassurance seems to soothe it. Ian Borthwick is brandishing
petitions against the project with more than 2000 names. ''I can't
ignore that,'' he said. ''I go with my people and what my people tell me
is that they will not tolerate the plan.''
And beneath the obvious discontent another layer of fury grows. Some
residents speak of intimidation from unruly elements already living in
St Mary's. ''I didn't take on a mortgage to sit locked in my house,
watching out for my property,'' says one man who claims his protests
against the venture have brought threats of physical violence, and the
thud of late-night harassment against his door. At that bad-tempered
session before Christmas this man asked the council if they would buy
back his house at the sum he had paid for it. ''The answer was no, I was
on my own. That's admitting our property is now devalued. At the same
time our insurance will be going up. Believe me, if this plan succeeds
and these folk do become good neighbours I'd like to think I'd be the
first to stand up and admit I was wrong. But if it goes rotten, as I
believe it will, with gangs coming over from the other side of town,
what will those in charge tell me then?''
At Labour-held Dundee District Council the housing convener, Freddie
Welsh, fastens his anger on another target. ''I am appalled by the
behaviour of Councillor Borthwick in this matter. We run projects right
across the city for vulnerable families -- battered wives and the
homeless -- who must be placed very discreetly for obvious reasons. Most
Labour wards in Dundee contain such projects but by going public on this
location Councillor Borthwick has damaged the confidential nature of
such ventures. He has stigmatised the victims and scared the community
by making out we are putting people in a unit like something at
Barlinnie.'' The intended residents, he stresses repeatedly, are people
who in the past year have been judged by social workers to have mended
their ways. ''They are not anti-social, but vulnerable.''
Dundee has long been regarded as innovative in its housing and social
policies. It was the first housing authority in Scotland to apply for
interdicts against anti-social tenants in certain cases as an
alternative to the lengthy legal process of seeking evictions. But is
this new departure a social experiment destined to backfire, or a
skilled and imaginative way of helping some at least escape the bleak
realities of poverty?
For one year, each of the four families chosen for the project will
stay in the refurbished apartments (radiator heating, fitted kitchens,
partly tiled bathroom, and shower), and then, with appropriate
guarantees, be placed in mainstream housing throughout the city. The
tenants already at the address are being relocated, and will receive a
standard financial package of home improvement options to the value of
around #1500. Number 7 was never substandard housing but inevitably its
sprucing up and the very mention of money for departing tenants has
added more bitterness and further division. ''Dundee's slogan is Putting
heart back into the city. Well, they've taken the heart right out of our
scheme,'' says a shopper in the St Giles precinct. ''We've got people
bickering and neighbours fighting about this. At that public meeting
someone tried to take a swipe at one of the officials.''
The unfortunate was Russell Rowbotham, Dundee's director of housing,
who was allegedly jostled. Tomorrow the various bodies involved will
again meet local representatives, hoping for reasoned discussion,
determined to calm anxieties. A story, then, centred on Dundee but the
fable of any town where individuals are falling through the shredded net
of welfare. Anger, fear, despair...All these negative forces are
building in our cities where the demarcation lines between rich and poor
are hardening. Nobody wants the impoverished on the doorstep. They mess
things up. They make some of us feel guilty. But Councillor Welsh asks:
''Where are the poor to go? Are we to leave them in a field? In a modern
city you must try to rehabilitate them." And he's right. Disowning the
disaffected resolves nothing. There is a contradictory word for such
inaction -- it's called assault.

RAB KILGOUR sank his #7000 redundancy pay-off from the Seafield pit
into a fishing boat. Fife Enterprise is about to sink his business.
The irony of an enterprise company evicting Methil's small fishing
fleet, made up of nine prawn trawlers and two boats creel-fishing for
lobster and crab, from a town which presents a dreary portrait of
deprivation, in an area where unemployment is not an endemic condition
but a fact of life, does not escape the former miner.
He was given an enterprise allowance to set up as a prawn fisherman
when he found himself surplus to economic requirements with the collapse
of mining in Fife. Now, some seven years later, like many of the other
men from Methil who scrape a living from the bed of the Firth of Forth,
he finds himself powerless to challenge the decision that will once more
end his livelihood.
It is not a big story. It might, though, be a story of our times. The
unaccountable loss of the new life that Rab salvaged out of the old
leaves him more bewildered than bitter: ''I don't know why they've done
it. It's plain daft, that's what it is. And heartless. My son David and
I make enough to survive on now, just. We can't afford to go somewhere
else. Now we've got two weeks notice to quit. We'll have to give up in
the summer.''
He will, he says, have to put his 30ft trawler, Hazel-M, which he
converted himself from an old diver's boat, up for sale.
Fife Enterprise told The Herald that it was a safety issue; that the
jetty was becoming too dangerous for continued use by commercial craft.
The fishermen angrily refute this, claiming that work is being carried
out on it by the Methil Boat Club, of which they are members, which
leases the facility from Fife Enterprise. They claim that surveys have
found no major structural problems.
Negotiations over the lease were conducted by Methil Boat Club and
Fife Enterprise. The enterprise company were keen that difficulties
surrounding the harbour's future should not be made public. Fearful that
their chances of renegotiating a lease would be jeopardised, the club
members refused to speak to the press -- until the fishermen learned of
their fate in a letter sent to the boat club on February 10.
No contact was made directly with the fishermen by Fife Enterprise.
The enterprise company say they understood that as the fishermen were
members of the club, that constituted consultation.
Whatever the truth, one stark fact is evident -- Fife Enterprise,
which received #23.7m from the Government, is holding out no helping
hand, no offers this time of grants or allowances to help compensate the
fishermen for the loss of their safe harbour.
The boat club has spent #35,000 of its members money in upgrading over
the past seven years. It is to pay for repairs needed to the jetty, part
of which is to be demolished and the surplus wood used to strengthen the
remainder.
The February 10 letter, which followed three meetings with Fife
Enterprise, offered the boat club a new lease. It stipulated that no
commmercial boats would be permitted to berth within the dock. The
maximum size of craft was to be reduced from its current length of 50
feet.
This, says Willie, puts at risk 11 businesses and the future
employment of 22 men. The boat club will lose the income it receives
from the fishermen, which means it may no longer be able to carry on.
The rent has been increased from #10 a year to #1000. That is a lot of
money for the members to find. Many are working men, most are without
work and spend their days pottering around their boats, taking them to
fish with lines ''. . . because it's better than sitting in front of the
television all day. It gives them an interest, something to hold on
to''.
The boat club lease, renewed this month, will run for a year. Fife
Enterprise has told members the club has no long-term future. They
should look elsewhere for berths.
It was, says Willie Brooks, a harsh decision. Fife Enterprise is keen
to attract business to the site. They want to gentrify it, infill the
dock and attract development to the area.
The fishermen know and accept that the enterprise company have plans
for the docks. They and other boat club members who moor their craft at
No 3 dock, would not object to new business coming in even if they had
to move out. On the contrary. It would provide jobs, probably not for
them but for others.
But, says Willie, there are no immediate prospects of that, so why
take away what already exists: ''We have members who have sunk their
savings into their boats, others who suffered the heartache of the
destruction of the collieries and being made redundant and who went to
the fishing to make a new life.
''But there's nothing happening now. Why risk the small businesses
that do exist for something that might happen sometime in the future?''
Willie, a redundant mechanic, will probably survive. His trawler,
Avail, is big enough to fish elsewhere, perhaps up the coast at
Pittenweem where the Methil fishermen land their catches. It will mean
longer hours at sea though, and he already fishes 16 hours a day. Methil
is the only harbour in the Forth which is accessible at all states of
the tide.
For Rab, and others, no such choice exists. His trawler is too small
to fish in more exposed waters or foul weather. He would have to tie up
longer, that would reduce his meagre income to a loss.
Methil grew out of the advent of coal which destroyed the earlier
fishing industry. It seems sad that those thrown back again on the sea
after coal's demise should again find themselves facing an uncertain
future.

Small businesses are picking up on the many advantages of electronic
banking. Iain Fleming reports on a flourishing cottage industry.
THE last few years have seen a revolution in electronic banking, with
the ''hole-in-the-wall'' cash dispenser now an everyday part of life.
But electronic banking for the customer goes further than simply
sticking a card in a machine and getting money out.
It can also mean the customer carrying out virtually every banking
task -- short of applying for an overdraft -- through a computer
terminal sitting on an office desk or even via a ''smart'' phone at
home, and small business start-ups are the latest group to feel the
benefit.
The attractions of such a system are obvious for those who are located
some distance from their branch or are simply too busy to stand in a
queue to carry out non-cash transactions.
This type of banking has been around for a decade, and while it was
initially targeted at personal customers, the banks are now just as keen
to sign up business customers, particularly small businesses. The Bank
of Scotland will even offer its business customers a computer terminal
free of charge with which they can access the bank's central computer
for up to 18 hours a day if they join HOBS, its Home and Office Banking
Service.
One of the attractions of electronic banking -- beyond the sheer
convenience aspect -- are the special accounts available to customers
who bank this way, and the ability to get high rates of interest on
them.
The Clydesdale, for instance, offers four bands of interest with 1.5%
on balances up to #2000, 4.5% on balances between #2000 and #10,000,
5.25% for between #10000 and #100,000 and the maximum of 6.25% on
balances above #100,000. Interest is Gross, calculated daily and paid
half-yearly into the accounts and carries no penalty for instant
withdrawal, making the accounts very useful for businesses looking for
somewhere to place short-term funds.
In addition, inter-account transfers are free so there is no
additional cost to transfer money -- even overnight -- into and out of
the investment account while the costs of running the account can be
much cheaper than traditional accounts with business users only paying
20 pence for a regular bill payment.
The reason why the Bank of Scotland is giving the hardware and
software allowing businesses already with a PC the ability to use their
system is to help the customer have more control over their accounts.
The spokeswoman added: ''As cash flow is important to all businesses
-- particularly those in a start-up situation, the system allows the
customer to check his or her current position as often as they like at
first hand.
''It also allows them to query the last three months transactions and
carry out other tasks like order pay-in books or statements or instruct
payments for up to 30 days ahead.''
The Bank of Scotland's HOBS (Home and Office Banking Service) was
first in the marketplace 10 years ago, when customers had to connect a
special keyboard and a modem to their television screen and telephone
socket.
Despite the spaghetti-like wiring and claims that it was ahead of its
time and a ''nine-day wonder'' the system proved popular and was
expanded the following year for business accounts.
When a more compact terminal (based on the Minitel installed in nearly
every French home) was introduced in 1991 the demand shot up and last
year an even more compact and ''smarter'' screenphone which would not
look out of place in a domestic setting was introduced.
The Clydesdale was next into the market with its Telebank service in
1987, offering much the same type of remote banking facilities and
specifically aimed at business customers.
Despite this, the bank was surprised by the number of personal
customers who joined the service, as they do not offer any deals on
either the equipment to connect to its system or the necessary software
to operate it.
While both the Clydesdale and Bank of Scotland systems use on-line
viewdata -- the same as that used by travel agents for holiday bookings
and based on BT's Prestel graphics-based data communications system, the
Royal Bank of Scotland uses a different system on its Royline service,
aimed specifically at business customers.
Similar to the Clydesdale's service for larger business users, the
data is transferred much more quickly from the bank's computer to
hard-disk storage on the customer's personal computer. The Bank of
Scotland also offers a similar service, known as Corporate HOBS.
Although the systems for personal and small business users are similar
in features, charges differ so that personal customers of both the Bank
of Scotland and Clydesdale pay #4 a month, while Bank of Scotland
business customers pay #10 and Clydesdale business users pay #14 a
month.
In addition, while Clydesdale customers have to pay five pence a
minute on-line charges during business hours and on a Saturday morning,
Bank of Scotland does not make an on-line charge as all calls to HOBS
are through the Bank's own telecommunications network and are at local
call rates. Some Clydesdale customers may not be able to access their
system at local call charges, depending on their geographical location.
Despite that, the costs of running accounts this way can still work
out cheaper than making regular telephone calls to branches, as well as
giving much more control over the running of the accounts.

<HEADLINE>Stockman fined for hitting cattle</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979747024</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A STOCKMAN who was secretly filmed by animal rights activists as he
rained blows with a stick on cattle appeared in court yesterday to plead
guilty to breaking animal welfare laws.
Depute-fiscal Lorraine Glancy told Stirling Sheriff Court that a video
taken at Stirling Auction Mart on November 2 showed the accused using a
stick to control cattle as they were moved in a fenced area.
She described the video as being taken by a member of the public who
was involved in animal welfare.
Miss Glancy said that, on several occasions, livestock agent John
Davidson, an employee of the market, could be seen hitting cattle with
the stick.
The video was shown to officials of the Scottish Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at its headquarters on January 20, and
the society reported the abuse to the procurator-fiscal.
Davidson, 31, of Rowallan Drive, Bannockburn, pled guilty to using
excessive force to control cattle at the market by repeatedly striking
them on the head and body with a stick, contravening both the 1990
Welfare of Animals Act and the 1981 Animal Health Act.
Solicitor-advocate George Pollock, defending, said Davidson had
allowed his frustration to get the better of him when the cattle he was
moving turned suddenly and started coming back towards him.
He said his client admitted using more force than was allowed but
there was no sign of injury to any of the beasts and it was certainly
not a case where any suffering had been caused.
''On a scale of these things, I'd suggest this was at the lowest,'' he
said.
He said Davidson, a married man with one child, had been employed at
the market since 1979, more or less since he left school, and continued
to be well thought of by his employers.
Sheriff Francis Keane said Davidson had used force of a degree in
excess of that which was reasonable. He fined him #100.
Asked as he left court whether he felt victimised by the animal
welfare lobby, Davidson said: ''I would rather make no comment.''

SOME MPs are ''killing themselves'' with their unhealthy lifestyles,
Labour's Tony Banks (Newham North-West) told the Commons yesterday. He
said the Commons was an unhealthy place to work, and it was time ''we
had a proper programme that sets an example -- and that we had healthy
minds and bodies in this House.'' Responding for the Commons Commission,
Mr Alan Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed -- Lib. Dem.) pointed out that the
parliamentary gymnasium was available ''for the improvement of personal

A YOUTH robbed a bus driver of #8 at gunpoint to buy food, including
curry sauce for his starving cat, a court heard yesterday.
Neither Sean Reynolds nor his cat Spliff had eaten for three days when
he staged the armed robbery in desperation, Lord Abernethy was told at
the High Court in Edinburgh. The judge sentenced him to nine months'
detention.
Reynolds, 17, told his victim: ''Sorry, but I have got to feed myself
and the cat.'' He admitted assaulting the bus driver, Mr Stewart Walker,
25, by presenting an air pistol at him at Callendar Riggs bus station in
Falkirk on October 27 last year and robbing him of #8.
Mr Hugh Matthews QC, Advocate-depute, told the court that Reynolds,
who was living in Birnam Place, Falkirk, at the time, boarded a Midland
Bluebird bus as it drew up at a stance just after 11pm. He had a
baseball cap pulled down over his face and approached the driver, who
was alone, pointing the gun at him. The driver emptied the change
machine which contained just a few pounds and, after Reynolds insisted
that was not enough, produced some notes from his shirt pocket.
Reynolds scooped up the money, saying something like: ''Sorry, but I
have to feed myself and the cat.''
Later, during a taped interview at Falkirk Police Station, Reynolds
said that after the robbery he went to a Chinese restaurant with the
proceeds and ordered food for himself plus an extra portion of chips
with curry sauce.
''I know it sounds stupid but the cat likes curry sauce,'' he told
police.
Mr Ian Donaldson, defence counsel, said Reynolds had been living on
his own for a few months and, for financial reasons, had given up his
YTS job as a care assistant in an old people's home. He became caught in
a ''benefits trap'' and had been left without any money.
''He had not eaten since the Monday,'' explained Mr Donaldson. ''In
complete and utter desperation for himself and the cat, which by this
time was showing signs of considerable concern, he went out and
committed the stupidest act of his life.''
The court was told Spliff was now being looked after by Reynolds's
parents.
Lord Abernethy told Reynolds: 'You have pleaded guilty to a serious
charge of assault and robbery. Bus drivers are in a particularly
vulnerable situation and the courts must do everything they can to
protect them.

BABYSITTER Rachel Rooney may have being trying to protect a
seven-year-old boy in her charge when she died at the hands of a
frenzied killer, it was revealed last night.
The 15-year-old girl was found murdered close to Jonathan Copley in a
bedroom.
The pair were repeatedly stabbed in the attack, which was described as
''frenzied and constant''.
Detectives believe the killer may have known Rachel or tricked his way
into the terrace house in Southfield Lane, Little Horton, Bradford, West
Yorkshire, as there was no sign of a break-in.
Detectives were sickened at the ferocity of the attack.
Special assemblies were held yesterday at two schools where the
children were pupils.
Mr Stewart Duxbury, headteacher at Southmere First School, where
blond-haired Jonathan was a pupil, had the task of breaking the grim
news to children too young to understand the gravity of the situation.
Less than half a mile away, Mr Richard Thompson, headteacher of the
Upper Grange School, where Rachel was a pupil, expressed his shock.
He said everyone was ''heartbroken''. He added: ''Not only were we
praying for Rachel but we were also praying for Jonathan's sister,
Elizabeth, who is also a pupil here.''
The bodies were discovered by Jonathan's mother, Denise, her boyfriend
Brian McDonagh, her daughter Elizabeth, 15, and a family friend when
they returned after a night out on Saturday.

UIE Scotland Ltd at Clydebank is to build the prototype of a
wave-power generator which will be tested in the powerful waters of the
Pentland Firth.
The contract, for an undisclosed seven-figure sum, has been placed
with the Clydebank yard by Inverness-based Applied Research Technology
(ART), which developed the concept. It will create 60 jobs at the yard
between now and May.
Once the prototype, known as the Osprey (Ocean Swell Powered Renewable
Energy) is constructed, it will be installed in the Pentland Firth for
an experimental period, where it will generate up to 2MW for the
National Grid.
Mr Brian Divers, managing director of UIE Scotland, said yesterday:
''UIE are pleased to have been awarded a contract by ART for the
construction of the collector unit of Osprey. This work is a little
different from our usual offshore oil and gas-related activities.
However, we are delighted to be associated with ART on what is a very
interesting project.''
Osprey consists of a 20m-wide steel canopy, which is anchored to the
seabed 300m from the shore in 14.5m of water, and sits on the surface.
As the waves rise and fall beneath the canopy, air is forced through a
turbine to generate electricity.

VICTIMS of sex attacks can now be provided with a booklet to help them
understand what is involved in reporting the crimes.
It advises where to get support to cope with the pressures which come
with investigations and court cases.
Judy ''X'', the sex assault victim whose courageous disclosure of her
experience to the 1993 Conservative Party Conference won backing for
action to assist others, was on the platform at the Edinburgh launch of
the booklet with Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie. She
said: ''Oh, how I wish there had been such a booklet available to me.''
She recalled the agonies of the attack and the indignities and ordeals
of medical examination, the identity parade, and the case.
At the launch, Lord Fraser disclosed that a Scottish Office study into
what should be included in reports to women victims of sex attacks on
the progress being made to bring culprits to justice would be completed
soon.
However, Victim Support Scotland was also told that the more
controversial questions involving ''victim impact'' statements, giving
victims' accounts of attacks and their effects, in the prosecution of
alleged attackers would take longer to resolve.
Lord Fraser also announced VSS is to have its Scottish Office funding
raised by #100,000 to almost #1m.
Lord Fraser said the Government's priority was to reduce the number of
assaults but fully accepted the case for victims to be informed of
progress on their cases. ''The issue is not whether they should receive
information. The issue is what information victims actually need and
want. The way to answer that question is to ask the victims themselves
what they want and need, and that is being undertaken. The results of
that research will shortly be available.''
Recent debate had revealed no clear consensus on the details and
purpose of ''victim impact'' statements.
Meanwhile, police yesterday were hunting a man who sexually assaulted
a 23-year-old student in Bruntsfield Terrace, Edinburgh, on Sunday.
A police spokesman said she had managed to talk to the man, which
appeared to have calmed him down.

<HEADLINE>Two sides step up fight over Europe Rebels publish Bill for referendum  -- as opponents push federal case</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE Euro-sceptics yesterday published a Bill calling for a
referendum on Britain's future in Europe -- while a cross-party group of
Europhiles launched a new body to fight the federal corner.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, whose Bill will have its second
reading debate in the Commons on Friday, said she believed its call for
a referendum before the next inter-governmental summit considers further
changes in the European Union, could unite the party.
It would raise support for the Prime Minister, who would be seen as
willing to trust the people, she said.
The Bill offers voters a choice between full integration into a
federal Europe with a single currency or retaining trading links with
Europe while repatriating substantial powers from Brussels.
Mrs Gorman said it was essential to have the referendum before the
inter-governmental summit ''so as to inform those negotiating on behalf
of the people what the people think.''
She said she believed the Bill had substantial backing from some
members of the Labour Party and cited Mr Kenneth Baker, Mr Norman Lamont
and Sir Norman Fowler as former Tory Cabinet Ministers who had said they
supported a referendum.
Sir Teddy Taylor, one of the eight other whipless Tory MPs who support
the Bill, said he thought the Bill would receive a second reading but
could be killed off unless a substantial number of MPs voted for it.
Government and Opposition whips are likely to discourage MPs from
voting, as they did last week when a Liberal Democrat motion calling for
a referendum was carried, after a thinly attended debate, by only 47
votes to three. The main parties argue that this robs the decision of
any significance.
Ironically, both Mr Major and Mr Blair are considering promising a
referendum in their next election manifesto, but both are concerned that
the commitment could heighten internal divisions in their parties.
Working against the Bill is the habit of most MPs to be in their
constituencies on a Friday, rather than in the House, when Government
business requiring a large attendance is rarely dealt with.
Sir Teddy urged the Government to give Ministers a free vote and
called on MPs, whatever their views, to turn up and vote.''The way in
which this will be killed off is if MPs go on strike on Friday. That is
our greatest fear,'' he said.
Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, a former President of the European
Commission, now leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, said Mrs
Gorman's Bill was destructive.
''Almost anything emanating from that source is likely to be
destructive,'' he added.
He said the questions proposed did not seem either clear or simple. He
had never ruled out the possibility and perhaps the desirability of a
referendum towards the end of the nineties, ''providing you have a clear
question to put to the people.''
Lord Jenkins was speaking at the launch of a cross party ''round
table'' group of MPs, peers and Euro-MPs from all parties which aims to
push for closer European links in the run up to the inter-governmental
summit.
He said at a news conference in London that Europe needed a centre
core of governments committed to European integration to increase the
Union's democracy and efficiency.
If Britain was not prepared to join the central core, it should at
least not obstruct others, he said.
''If we cannot lead we must at least avoid a wrecking role,'' he said.
''But that is very much a second best, for it leads us straight down
the dreary road which we have so often followed in the past -- decline
to join at the beginning, let others shape the future, and then come in
belatedly and half-heartedly, complaining that the scheme does not
exactly suit us.
''How much better it would be if we could for once give a constructive
lead,'' he said.
The Federal Trust, a think tank on Europe founded in 1945 is behind
the formation of the group and yesterday published its own proposals for
the summit which called for Britain not to stand in the way of the
creation of a single currency or the formation of a central federal core
of member countries.
Mr Andrew Duff, author of the report and director of the Trust, said:
''The pro-Europeans have started to twitch into life.
''We object to the idea that Britain can be a bit player on the
European stage.''
The federalists want to give more power to the institutions of the EU,
something the sceptics fiercely oppose, to make its operation more
democratic and efficient.
They also want to see a common foreign and security policy ''with
clout''.
Among more than 70 influential figures who are members of the new
group are former European Commissioners Lord Cockfield and Lord
Tugendhat, Baroness Shirley Williams (Lib. Dem.), Mr Charles Kennedy,
Liberal Democrat MP for Ross Cromarty and Skye and Mr Giles Radice
Labour MP for Durhan North.

A BANK manager accused of embezzling #163,200 in old notes he should
have incinerated was a Scrooge, the High Court in Glasgow was told
yesterday.
Mr Hector MacGillivray, 54, who denies taking the money, would not
allow his wife to buy curtains or hire a decorator to paint their
kitchen.
A jury at the High Court in Glasgow was told by Advocate- depute, Mrs
Valerie Stacey, prosecuting: ''He was mean and would not let her spend
money. His wife described him as a Scrooge.''
Instead, the Clydesdale Bank manager invested money and moved it
around building societies to gain the best interest, she said.
Mr MacGillivray claimed he kept #11,000 he inherited in a ''poly bag''
in the back of his wardrobe, earning no interest.
However, that would have been out of character for him and was
''rubbish'', she said.
There was ample evidence to back up a confession made by him to police
that he took the money, she told the jury in the fourth week of the
trial.
Examination of Mr MacGillivray's bank statements showed he rarely
cashed a cheque or used a cash dispenser.
Mrs Stacey said: ''It would be quite handy if you could help yourself
when you needed money.'' That is what Mr MacGillivray, of Thomson Drive,
Bearsden, confessed to doing, she told the jury.
He told police during a tape-recorded interview that he began taking
small amounts in l972 and latterly was pocketing up to #600 a week.
He confessed to taking the money from the ''burning boxes'' in the
bank's headquarters in Glasgow.
''How much did he take?'' asked Mrs Stacey.
She added: ''He doesn't even know himself.''
Mr MacGillivray had #57,000 of savings but #26,000 of this could not
be accounted for, she said.
His polythene bag finally got the ''heave-ho'' when Mr MacGillivray
began depositing the #13,000 in building societies, she said.
She reminded the jury that other bank staff alleged they saw Mr
MacGillivray taking money.
Mr MacGillivray denies taking the money over a 20-year period.
The jury will be directed by Lord Prosser before being asked to return
a verdict today.

As the deal to sell HCI goes through Economics Editor ALF YOUNG
speaks to its latest investor who is confident of getting a good
return
''IT'S been my observation over many years in the venture capital
industry,'' said Mr Colin Edwards yesterday, ''that it's the third guy
into any new business who generally makes the money.
''The first guy has the dream. The second guy finishes the building
and opens the doors. But it's usually the third guy who comes along with
the momentum to make the whole thing work.''
It's debatable whether the Abu Dhabi Investment Company is the second
or third guy into HCI, the controversy-ridden private medical complex at
Clydebank. But Mr Edwards, as head of the projects department at ADIC,
is convinced that the dream of a world centre of medical excellence on
Clydeside can indeed be turned into reality.
Since the ambitious #180m project crashed into receivership last
November, having run out of cash before it could drum up an adequate
patient flow, the Abu Dhabi connection has always seemed the most likely
lifeline.
One of HCI's two founders, Dr Raphael Levey, has influential links to
the Gulf emirate. ADIC was an equity investor, on a very modest scale,
in the original HCI venture. The investment company -- formed under
Emiri decree in 1977, owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and
the National Bank of Abu Dhabi -- is, ultimately, controlled by the Al
Nahyans, Abu Dhabi's ruling family. With an asset base in excess of
US$1000m (#633m), AIDC is not short of resources.
Before HCI finally succumbed to receivership, ADIC was actively trying
to assist in a financial restructuring of the ill-starred venture. With
the watershed of receivership passed, it was on the cards that the men
from the Gulf would be key players in what happened next.
Although they could claim some local expertise -- Mr Colin Edwards's
colleague in the negotiations was Mr David Currie, a Fifer, who used to
work in the Glasgow office of 3i -- the ADIC team hired local support in
the shape of Mr Frank Blin, managing partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand and a
veteran of many a Scottish receivership.
''There were other parties interested in developing the HCI concept.
But we were confident we were the foremost player,'' Mr Blin said
yesterday. The mountain of due diligence to be gone through before a
firm offer could be made and accepted was compounded by the 4000 miles
which lay between the Gulf and Clydebank.
At one stage, a whole floor of the Hilton Hotel in Glasgow was taken
over to accommodate Royal visitors from the Gulf emirate, over to see
the hospital for themselves.
Over and over again yesterday, Mr Edwards emphasised the significance
of the medical and support team at HCI in ADIC's decision to put
together a rescue package. ''We have been very impressed by the team we
found here. So much so that the only significant post we are seeking to
fill is that of chief executive officer.''
The same point was made by Mr Edwards's boss and HCI's new chairman,
Mr Hareb Al Darmaki. ''Over the recent weeks that we have been working
on the acquisition, we have got to know many of the individuals who work
at HCI. We have been very impressed and encouraged, not only by their
calibre and professionalism, but also by their continued loyalty,
commitment, and support of the project,'' he said in a statement.
These views are reciprocated. ''ADIC was the staff's preferred group
to work with,'' said HCI's director of clinical affairs, Dr Larry
Hollier. ''We could see that we shared mutual goals.''
Not everyone shares either the goals or the vision. Although HCI has
been saved, its numerous critics have not gone away. The only numbers
the new owners were prepared to indulge in yesterday were ambitious
ones. A break-even on cash flow within two years. An additional 450 jobs
at Clydebank within a similar period. All based on tempting a lot more
patients from Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa to Clydebank for
treatment.
If that happens, the third guy will make money. If it doesn't, Mr
Edwards will have to revise that observation.

A FORMER Shadow Foreign Secretary revealed yesterday that he was once
the target of a clumsy KGB recruitment attempt. The move by Mr Gerald
Kaufman was prompted by weekend allegations about Mr Michael Foot.
Mr Kaufman said he had been handed an envelope full of money by an
insistent Russian minder during a visit to Moscow in 1987.
However, he took the advice of the then British ambassador, Sir Bryan
Cartledge, and handed the money over to a Soviet charity in a
high-profile presentation in the foyer of the Bolshoi theatre.
The disclosure came amid hotly denied claims that Mr Foot, the former
Labour leader, was an ''agent of influence'' for Soviet intelligence in
the 1960s.
Mr Kaufman, a key player in Labour politics throughout the Kinnock
years, said the accusation levelled against Mr Foot by former double
agent Oleg Gordievsky was ''absurd''.
The Sunday Times said the KGB made 12 cash payments of #150 to Mr Foot
to help him fund the left-wing Tribune newspaper between 1961 and 1968.
Mr Foot denounced the claim as an ''absolute lie'' and was given full
backing by the Labour Party hierarchy.
Mr Kaufman said in an article for the Evening Standard: ''As a highly
principled back-bench rebel during the Attlee and Wilson governments of
1945-51 and 1964-70, he could scarcely have been accused even of being a
Labour Party agent.''
He said the report underlined the need for MPs to be cautious in
dealing with representatives of foreign governments, and disclosed the
apparent entrapment attempt upon himself. It happened during the 70th
anniversary celebrations for the Bolshevik revolution.
''During time out from official ceremonies, my minder -- who, from his
elegant suit alone I took for granted was a KGB agent -- suggested a
little shopping,'' he said.
''In the huge Gum department store, he handed me an envelope which he
told me contained spending money. I said I did not want it but he
insisted I take it.''
Back at the embassy, Mr Kaufman told Sir Bryan -- by a written note
for fear of bugging -- of his embarrassment at the payment and sought
advice about returning the money without showing discourtesy.
The ambassador told him to give the money to the Chernobyl disaster
fund in as public a place as possible.

THE increasing importance of the electronics industry to Scotland's
economy was underlined sharply by figures published yesterday.
The latest edition of the Scottish Economic Bulletin, produced by the
industry department of the Scottish Office, shows the vast divergence
between the performance of various manufacturing sectors.
Overall, in the 12 months up to the middle of last year, there was a
5% increase in manufacturing output, as measured by the department's
index of production and construction.
However, that figure is heavily influenced by companies in the
electrical and instrument engineering (EIE) sector, which achieved a 26%
growth in total output. The sector's best performer was electronic
components, which achieved a spectacular 45% rise.
Other Scottish manufacturing sectors, when combined, showed a 1.5%
fall in output, with heavy industry slipping significantly, most notably
in the industrial plant and steelwork sector, which recorded a 23%
decrease.
The authors of the bulletin point out that, including EIE figures, the
production index was 2% above its previous peak, in pre-recession 1990.
However, if the EIE statistics were stripped out, the index would be 14%
down from that high point.

MAJOR projects in Monklands district, such as the Time Capsule leisure
complex, were located in Coatbridge instead of Airdrie because the sites
were considered to be both more accessible and viable, an inquiry was
told yesterday.
Monklands District Council leader Jim Brooks said the site for the
#12m Time Capsule was chosen because it had access to main road and rail
links and because the complex had to serve a ''regional'' population of
more than two million if it was to receive EU funding of about #7m.
Mr Brooks -- who was speaking during the first public session of the
inquiry into allegations of corruption and impropriety in the council --
said the Summerlee heritage park was also situated in Coatbridge because
it was based on the town's former iron and steel industries, while
facilities at Drumpellier Country Park near the town were developed
because it was the only appropriate site available.
Responding to allegations of an imbalance of capital expenditure in
favour of Coatbridge, Mr Brooks told the inquiry: ''If anyone says that
that is where the imbalance comes, then I can't argue that there isn't
an imbalance.
''But the imbalance is based on our ability to place them
geographically, the avilability of land, and the availability of
funding.
''They are the three basic criteria we used to develop these three
projects. I don't see any reason why they should not have been there,
because we could not have put them anywhere else. It would have been a
loss, as far as I'm concerned, to allow that money to go.''
Monklands Provost Eric Burns, who was giving evidence alongside Mr
Brooks, said it ''stunned'' him that some people had suggested that the
Summerlee heritage centre should be situated anywhere other than
Coatbridge, a town formerly known as the Iron Burgh.
Mr Brooks was later asked by inquiry chairman Professor Robert Black
why similar investments could not be found in Airdrie. Mr Brooks said
that strategic projects such as the Time Capsule were needed to replace
redundant works and stimulate tourism in an area which had been deprived
of investment for decades.
The three main projects -- the Time Capsule, Summerlee, and
Drumpellier -- attracted more than 1.5m people in 1993.
Mr Brooks added that the balance of investment this year had
''dramatically shifted'' in favour of Airdrie with a major industrial
development planned at the Mill Street yards, and further investment
earmarked for a site which could be used for motor racing.
Expenditure on the council's housing stock of 22,000 was shared
equally among every ward, he added.
In support of his colleague's comments about the strategic projects,
Mr Burns told the inquiry: ''Do you think for a minute that I'd be
sitting back and forgetting about my own home town (Airdrie), the place
I was elected for? Not on your life. It was a corporate decision taken
by all councillors.''
Turning to the 30 members of the public attending the inquiry, Mr
Burns went on the offensive by claiming that the allegations against the
council were part of an effort to embarrass the former leader of the
Labour Party and local MP, the late John Smith.
''It was politically inspired because we had the future Prime Minister
in our constituency and the Tory party was suffering because of all the
things happening within it. Unfortunately, Monklands District Council
got caught up in it.''
Professor Black later told the two that some people, who had earlier
given evidence to the inquiry in private, had suggested that there was a
disproportionate number of council employees who were related to
councillors. He asked them how they thought relatives of councillors
should be treated on applying for council posts.
Mr Burns said: ''They should be treated in the same way as anyone
else.''
Professor Black, who holds the chair of Scots Law at Edinburgh
university, opened the first of three public sessions of the inquiry at
the Municipal Buildings in Coatbridge after gathering information and
taking statements from members of the public, MPs, and other interested
parties during the past three months.
The terms of reference of the inquiry are:
* An alleged imbalance of capital expenditure;
* Alleged religious discrimination regarding recruitment, housing, and
contracts;
* Allegations of malpractice;
* Allegations of nepotism regarding contracts, recruitment, and
housing.
Tomorrow, members of the public will hear Professor Black question the
convener of housing committee, Councillor Betty Leitch, and Directer of
Housing Services, Mr Tom McKenzie, on housing services procedures.
On Thursday, the public sessions will be concluded with councillors
and officials being questioned about recruitment policy and procedures.

A MOTORCYCLIST was jailed for 18 months and banned for the same period
after he admitted doing 150mph the wrong way down the M1.
Stuart Atkin, 20, still had two weeks of a six-month ban to serve when
he smashed into a police car on the motorway.
He was sentenced yesterday when he appeared at Snaresbrook Crown
Court, east London, and admitted aggravated vehicle taking of a Suzuki
GSXR 750.
When arrested for the M1 crash Atkin was also on bail pending a
hearing on charges of theft of vehicle parts between December 1993 and
May 1994.
Yesterday he received a further three months jail -- to run
concurrently -- after admitting those offences.
On April 14, 1994, he was convicted of 26 thefts from motor vehicles
and given 40 hours community service and 12 months' probation.
On August 8, 1994, he was fined #540 and given eight penalty points
for having no insurance.
Despite Atkin's terrible record, his defence barrister told the court
his client was not a habitual vehicle taker.
The barrister presented two social reports to the court then told
Judge Richard Haworth: ''You are not dealing with a person who is in the
habit of stealing motor vehicles, to coin a phrase, for joyriding.
''You are dealing here with a one-off incident of very bad driving.
''The temptation for the court is to think that he is a thoroughly bad
lot looking at his record.

FIRST business in the Commons yesterday was for the Speaker to record
the death of Sir Nicholas Fairbairn. If you weren't being outraged by
him, you were usually laughing at him. In a House of Commons sadly short
of colourful eccentrics, he will be badly missed, not least by sketch
writers.
The sad murmurs from MPs that followed the Speaker's announcement were
succeeded by a Question Time which would have offered the odd
opportunity for an out-of-the ordinary reflection from the late Member
for Perth and Kinross. It proceeded without him with blameless dullness.
One thought back to the salmonella debate when he reminded Mrs Edwina
Currie that she had once been an egg, adding: ''People on both sides of
the House greatly regretted its fertilisation.''
Social security exchanges contained the regular rounds of complaints
about the Child Support Agency, during which Mr Ronnie Campbell, a
sturdy Geordie, complained that men were being penalised by the system
when they married again but still had to pay maintenance for their first
family.
If this was what Mr Campbell meant, which was not entirely clear, he
appeared to be in a minority of one in thinking that acquiring a second
set of children absolves you from responsibility for the first.
Sir Nicholas could be rude but rarely as baldly so as Mr Dennis
Skinner's snarled ''keep your trap shut'' to Social Security Secretary
Peter Lilley, as he warned him off trying to help a junior Minister with
an answer.
Mr Skinner is sadly about the last Member who might be pointed out as
a character, but he has long since given up attempting to get his
effects by wit.
Simple rudeness seems to attract as much attention, and, with
''dimwit'' the best the Prime Minister of the day can think of in the
put-down line, the lack of a light touch to relieve a rather sour and
bitter Parliament is notably lacking. Still, The Sketch will keep an ear
open and report anything good that comes its way.
When Mr Greville Janner (Leicester West -- Lab.) threatened ''an
uprising'' if the Government didn't get a move on, it sounded briefly
stirring but, as the topic was the provision of creches for the tots of
toilers in the Palace, the threat lacked real resonance.
MPs vied with each other to say politically correct things about
creches and the admission of disabled persons to wherever they might
wish to go in the Palace.
Mr Tony Banks (Newham North-West -- Lab.), at one time about as close
to a regularly performing wit as the 1992 election gave the House,
appears to have suffered an attack of gravitas and exclaimed in alarmed
tones: ''Many MPs are killing themselves by their lifestyle,'' going on
to make a fervent plea for ''health awareness''.
Again one thought affectionately of Sir Nicholas, who certainly had a
lifestyle a description of which would probably be enough to give any
health fanatic a stroke. Nonetheless, Sir Nicholas found it more
rewarding than a lifetime of cholesterol checks. One wished he could
have been there to speak a witty word for dissipation.

Paris, Monday
A FRENCH police chief resigned today after Conservative Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur made an embarrassing about-face by criticising police
in a political phone-tapping scandal.
Balladur, favourite to win the April-May presidential election despite
a recent slide in support, suspended until further notice legal
procedures that allow the police to bypass courts for emergency phone
taps.
Yesterday he had defended controversial phone taps last year as
''perfectly regular and legal''. But his office today said the police
had misled the premier. It ordered a review to seek improvements.
Jacques Franquet, head of the Judicial Police or criminal
investigation department, offered his resignation in a letter to
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua ''to shield the service he has headed
for more than 20 months from all controversy.''
Franquet, whose police led the phone taps, planned to meet Pasqua
tomorrow. It was the first resignation in the scandal.
Balladur faced wide criticism today for acknowledging that his office
authorised the police to tape telephone conversations by a French
psychiatrist last year.
A French court ruled on February 9 that the psychiatrist, Jean-Pierre
Marechal, was used by police in a plot to derail a probe into the
finances of the Rally For the Republic (RPR) party, of which Balladur
and Pasqua are members.
The phone taps allegedly recorded Marechal extorting cash to mislead
the probe headed by his son-in-law, Judge Eric Halphen. Marechal says he
was framed in a plot hatched ''from high up.''
Balladur's opponents sought to make political capital from the
scandal. His withdrawal of support to the police might raise new
questions about his judgment -- he was already under fire for backing
down in the face of student unrest this month.
Before suspending the police's power to make phone taps in emergency
cases, he had told a television interviewer: ''Everything was perfectly
regular and legal. I challenge anyone to prove the opposite.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang, who faced a political storm when the
#180m HCI hospital called in receivers in November, last night welcomed
the news that it had been sold to buyers who said they had faith in the
original concept.
The new owner, the Abu Dhabi Investment Co, said it could still be
developed as a world-class private hospital and eventually employ 1800
people at Clydebank.
Mr Lang said: ''It is good to have this confirmation that the hospital
will now continue according to its original concept, as a private
health-care facility serving mainly overseas markets.''
Mr Lang's sentiments were shared by Dr George Mathewson, chief
executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland. He said: ''We have worked
extremely hard with the receivers and other banks to ensure an outcome
for HCI in the best interests of the local economy and of Scotland as a
whole. It is good to see that all the investment in time and effort has
produced a positive result.''
However, opposition MPs, who in the past have said HCI was an
ill-conceived white elephant on which public money had been squandered
needlessly, demanded assurances on the rescue deal.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said: ''Obviously
we welcome any attempt to save jobs at Clydebank but the public deserve
full assurances that the hospital will not compete with the NHS and that
no more public money will be spent unless HCI meets its promised jobs
target.''
Mr Tony Worthington, MP for Clydebank and Milngavie, said he would be
seeking an early meeting with the Abu Dhabi Investment Co.
Mr Worthington said: ''This sale will be very reassuring news for the
375 employees at the hospital who have been through a very worrying
time. I hope that number rapidly grows so that some of the #30m public
investment in the company yields a return in jobs for Clydebank and the
West of Scotland.
''It is encouraging that Abu Dhabi is investing because surely they
would not be doing so unless they intended to send hundreds of their
citizens to Clydebank for treatment.''
However, Mr Worthington said he would be seeking a meeting to hear
this confirmed by the company and to find out what arrangements it was
going to make with other states in the Middle East and elsewhere to send
patients.
''I also want to let them know the fears of people in Scotland about
HCI's impact on the NHS. We are angry about cut-price deals to treat NHS
patients. HCI was approved to treat overseas patients. If there are
people on NHS waiting lists who are waiting too long, then the
Government should put more money into NHS hospitals to cut those waiting
lists.
''HCI must not let itself be used by the Government to build up
private medicine at the expense of the NHS. I want promises from Abu
Dhabi that it has patients to send to Clydebank and that it will not be
undermining the NHS.''
Mr Jim Wallace, Scottish Liberal Democrats leader, said: ''This deal
will at least secure the jobs of the people employed at HCI and should
be welcomed. I hope that its future as a private hospital, treating
international patients, is now secure.''
However, he said the fact that HCI had been rescued did not reduce the
need for answers to the question of why so much public money was
approved for a project which scarcely got going before it fell. He said:
''It would certainly not be acceptable for more public money to have
been made available to complete this new deal.''
The SNP health spokesman, Mr Iain Glen, said: ''The realisation that
HCI is to continue in the form envisaged by the Scottish Office will
come as little surprise to many people, but it holds a considerable
threat for the health service.

Rome, Monday
SICILIAN Mafia bosses have ordered members to stop exchanging a ritual
kiss and abolished other centuries-old rites to try to improve secrecy,
Italian newspapers reported today.
The reports, many of them illustrated with photographs of Mafia
embraces from the Hollywood movie The Godfather, said investigators had
been told about the new rules by informers.
Police have arrested hundreds of suspected Mafiosi, including alleged
''boss of bosses'' Salvatore Riina, in the past three years with the
help of turncoats who have spilled the beans on their former partners in
crime.
''The fact is that the turncoat phenomenon has shot through Cosa
Nostra like a red-hot poker. Nobody trusts anybody any more,'' Corriere
della Sera newspaper said.
The reports said the kiss had been banned along with the ceremonial
swearing-in of new members and their introduction to other ''men of
honour'' with the ritual words ''E la stessa cosa'' (He is the same
thing).
Il Messaggero said Mafia initiation usually involved a new recruit
holding a burning holy picture while reciting the words: ''May I perish
in the fire if I betray my beloved mother.''
''The abolition of ritual affiliation points to the birth of a new,
compartmentalised Mafia, made up of tiny cells whose few members are
known only to each respective boss,'' it said.
Male relatives and close friends often greet each other with a kiss on
each cheek in Italy, particularly in the south.
But, according to informers, the kiss can also signify within the
Mafia that a deal has been sealed.
According to testimony from one leading turncoat, Riina's former
bodyguard Baldassare di Maggio, Riina exchanged such a kiss with Italy's
former prime minister Giulio Andreotti at a secret summit in 1987.
Andreotti, battling charges that he was a full member of the Mafia,
denies he met Riina and calls the kiss claim madness.
The newspaper reports could not be confirmed and one Sicilian writer
on the Mafia, Michele Pantaleone, told Corriere della Sera he understood
that the kiss had gone out of fashion in the Mafia in the mid-1960s.
But senior police officers say they believe the Mafia is reviewing its
inner workings following the blows it has suffered at the hands of
turncoats.
''The Mafia has been attacked from the inside and that is something
that has never happened before,'' said Gianni De Gennaro, a senior
police chief who headed the elite DIA anti-Mafia police unit until late
last year.
''It has seen many of its rules violated, rules on which its strength
was founded,'' he said last week.--Reuter.

Washington, Monday
THERE is still snow on the ground, lots of it, in New Hampshire and
the first primary of the 1996 election is a year away, but battle was
opened there last night.
Nine would-be presidents offered a first version of their party
programme at a Republican party dinner.
The candidates (none of whom has officially announced that they are
running), sat and smiled, spoke and smiled, listened and smiled, all in
a long row at the top table.
Their chief disagreement was over abortion, and anyone watching, or
listening, to the nine sound bites broadcast afterwards would conclude
that this will be a long and nasty campaign.
The party is split on the issue. A clear majority of Republican voters
approve women's right to have an abortion, at least in some
circumstances.
However, the most dedicated of the party faithful are so bitterly
''pro-life'' that they are ready to bring down the pillars of the house
if the party does not commit itself to their position.
The front-runner, Senator Bob Dole, said that he was against abortion
but would not make the position a test of party loyalty.
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and the former governor of Tennessee,
Lamar Alexander, agreed with him.
A couple of moderates (Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Miss
Lynn Martin, a former secretary of labour) said they were pro-choice but
had nothing against the other side.
Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana talked about foreign policy, to the
general bafflement of his audience.
But the real fireworks came from the right, with three possible
candidates breathing fire and brimstone on the abortion question.
Pat Buchanan, a journalist and broadcaster, who got 37% of the vote in
the New Hampshire primary against President Bush in 1992, claimed all
the credit for last November's victory and then insisted that the
Republican Party was pro-life and must fight to the death to protect the
unborn.
He sounded positively moderate compared to the two other fringe
candidates there, Congressman Robert Dornan of California, who
habitually embarrasses his colleagues by his intemperate attacks on the
President, and Alan Keyes, a black man who served in the Reagan
administration and lost two Senate election races in Maryland.
They not only excoriated the President, they were equally violent
against those Republicans who would not commit themselves body and soul
against abortion.
Mr Buchanan is the serious face of the far right. He told the
assembled Republicans that balancing the budget was all very well, but
the real issue facing America was its moral decline.
''There is still a moral crisis in America, still a cultural war being
fought,'' he claimed.
That was the tone set at the party convention in Houston in 1992 that
revolted huge numbers of people and contributed largely to Bill
Clinton's victory.
Mr Dole and Mr Gramm, who have serious hopes of winning the
nomination, are unsettled by such rhetoric: what would be the point of
leading a party of extremists that will never be accepted by the
electorate?

Paris, Monday
PALESTINIAN leader Yasser Arafat said today the Middle East peace
process had reached an impasse and called for outside help to move it
forward.
''We have great need today for France, for Europe, for the European
Union, to give impetus to the peace process to pull it out of the
impasse in which it is,'' Arafat told reporters after meeting French
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.
He repeated the plea in a later separate meeting with President
Francois Mitterrand.
''I know the European Union will be able to help us, the Palestinians,
as well as the Israelis, to head forward, towards this 'peace of the
brave' while equally taking into account each side's security needs,''
Arafat said.
The Palestinian leader said the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
whose executive committee is to meet in Cairo tomorrow to evaluate the
peace process, was still committed to the current negotiations.
Nabil Shaath, a main Palestinian peace negotiator and minister for
International Cooperation in Arafat's self-governing authority, later
told a conference on peace in the Mediterranean it would have been naive
not to expect problems in the peace process.
He insisted Arafat had seriously tackled Israel's security concerns
and suggested Israel resume troop withdrawals or that the peace process
bypass current interim moves and now begin negotiating a final
settlement.
Shaath denied in a later interview with Reuters correspondent Paul
Taylor that Arafat was under pressure from his inner circle or that his
popularity was diminishing among Palestinians.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, speaking at the same conference,
said Israel's security concerns were legitimate but it could not
reasonably hold Arafat accountable for each guerrilla attack inside
Israel.
* Israeli warplanes launched two raids on guerrilla targets in south
Lebanon today, the second day of intensifying hostilities on the last
active Arab-Israeli war front.
Security sources said two fighter-bombers swooped down on Jabal Abi
Rashed on the northeastern edge of the Israeli-occupied zone, firing at
least two air-to-surface missiles.
The raids, the sixth and seventh this year, came several hours after
Hizbollah guerrillas attacked an outpost of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army.--AP/Reuter.

Belgrade, Monday
SERBIA has set a lifting of international sanctions as its price for
considering the latest peace proposal on former Yugoslavia.
Official media today said Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic told
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev that easing sanctions was a
precondition for Serbia's cooperation.
''Belgrade is categorical -- first lifting of sanctions, and then
everything else,'' the official Tanjug news agency said in a commentary
on the weekend talks with Kozyrev.
Serbia has long looked to Russia as an ally in its battle with the
United Nations over economic sanctions imposed for actively supporting
the Serb side in the Bosnian civil war.
Kozyrev, who met Jovanovic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at
an isolated hunting lodge, offered sympathy to rump Yugoslavia and said
an easing of sanctions would help to reinforce an eight-week-old truce
in Bosnia.
But leaders of Serb minorities in Bosnia and the Croatian breakaway
region of Krajina today showed their preparedness for war, setting up a
top-level defence council to cement mutual aid agreements if attacked.
Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led government accused each other of
using the ceasefire to regroup and reinforce their armies and of
breaching the no-fly zone over Bosnia.
Fighting persisted around the UN-declared ''safe area'' of Bihac where
Bosnian government forces are surrounded by Bosnian and Krajina Serb
forces allied to local rebel Muslims.
Krajina Serbs today blocked a UN aid convoy reaching Bihac from
Zagreb, apparently breaching an earlier agreement on aid to the area
where people are said to face starvation after more than nine months
under vitual siege.
Kozyrev met Milosevic against the background of a fresh initiative by
the ''contact group'' -- Russia, the United States, France, Germany and
Britain --  to draw Serbia into the peace process. A French-led
initiative offers Belgrade relief from sanctions in return for
recognising Bosnia and Croatia.--Reuter.

Arles, Monday
AT 14, she met Vincent Van Gogh. At 20, she saw the first film made,
The Sprinkled Sprinkler by Louis Lumiere . . .
Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, now the world's oldest person, will blow
out 120 candles on her chocolate birthday cake tomorrow and down a glass
of champagne.
''I've waited 110 years to be famous. I plan to enjoy it for as long
as possible,'' she tells visitors with a smile.
She still powders her cheeks with a little rouge, only gave up smoking
three years ago, and was still riding her bicycle at 100.
Now blind, nearly deaf and confined to a wheelchair, the tiny
white-haired woman is still as alert as a hummingbird and with the wit
to match.
''I've only ever had one wrinkle,'' she says, ''and I'm sitting on
it.''
Jeanne will celebrate her birthday at a retirement home in the
Mediterranean town of Arles, where she was born in 1875 and has spent
all her life.
''(God) has forgotten me. He can't be in such a hurry to see me. He
already knows me very well,'' she says.
A widow for half a century -- after 54 years of marriage -- she has
outlived all her descendants. Her only child, a daughter, died in 1934,
and her grandson died in 1963.
''I take things as they come,'' she says. ''I am indefatigable.''
She was born five years after Napoleon III fell and a decade after the
murder of President Abraham Lincoln.
She still remembers visiting the Eiffel Tower as it was being built at
the turn of the century and at times confuses present-day French Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur with Edouard Dalladier, prime minister before
the Second World War.
The Van Gogh she met, ''with his ear'', was ''ugly as sin, bad
tempered, a grumbler and smelling of alcohol'', she recalls.
Researcher Jean-Marie Robine said: ''She never did anything special to
stay in good health.
''But among her ancestors we have found many people who lived very
long . . . from 15 to 20 years longer than their contemporaries with the
same lifestyle in the 18th and 19th centuries.''
Several Cambridge University researchers plan to pay her a birthday
visit to speak to her at length, fascinated not only by her longevity
but by her vitality.
If she stays healthy, she may break the all-time record for long life
set by Shigeshiyo Izumi of Japan, who died on February 21, 1986, at the
age of 120 years and 237 days.
On the eve of her birthday, she had received nearly 5000 letters, and
at least five books about her are being released.
Thirty years ago, a French solicitor, banking on her not living far
past 90, began paying her 2500 francs (#340) a month under a deal that
gives him ownership of her flat in Arles when she dies.
Andre Raffray, himself now 77 and retired, has paid out a total of
900,000 francs (#120,000), three times the value of the flat.
His wife said he is ''sickened'' by the expense.
Jeanne laughs: ''You can't win them all.''--Reuter.

A FORMER mayor of Berwick, Councillor Raymond Gilchrist, has called

Borders and upper Northumberland. Councillor Gilchrist said it was
totally unreasonable to expect distressed relatives to travel 60 miles
behind a hearse to the nearest crematoria, in Edinburgh and on Tyneside.

THE campaign to save Motorail and the Scottish sleepers last night
received the support of Londoners who gathered at the Commons to express
their fears for the future of their favourite rail services.
About 40 people braved bad weather to attend the first meeting of the
London Friends of the West Highland Line.
They heard speeches from Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs on the
progress of the efforts at Westminster to persuade the Government and
its director of rail franchising, Mr Roger Salmon, to reverse his
decision to axe Motorail and certain sleeper services.
For a bunch of Londoners, these latest recruits in support of
Scotland's railways exuded a distinct air of the Scottish countryside in
Committee Room 15.
Ross Cromarty and Skye MP Charles Kennedy said as he entered: ''There
are at least 10 clan chieftains in here.''
The Friends signed up its charter members at #5 a time.
A spectrum of ages and class were represented, dashing preconceptions
that most users of what is fondly refered to as the Deerstalker Express
are mainly tweed-wrapped peers and other lovers of field sports.
Sir Russell Johnston, MP for Inverness Nairn and Lochaber, gave
apologies for a variety of figures, including Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson, and said he was continuing his contacts with the
Government.
Mr Kennedy said: ''Our immediate task is to secure proper consultation
on these services.
''There is a world of difference between a consultation period on
services that included in the requirements and consultaiton on services
that have been dropped from the timetable.''
Labour's acting Transport spokesman Brian Wilson said support for
Motorail and sleeper services would be the first test for incoming
ScotRail director John Ellis, who takes over next month following the
sudden resignation of Mr Chris Green.
''As a Scottish Office Minister has admitted there has been no
consultation process. The sole threat to these services comes from the
unilateral action of Mr Salmon,'' Mr Wilson said.
''John Ellis can support the services by retaining them in the
timetable until such time as the free and formal consultation has taken
place.
''The alternative for him is to aquiesce in the deception by quietly
withdrawing them in order to satisfy the political masters, including
the franchising director.
''That is a stark choice for Mr Ellis at a crucial juncture in the
debate over the future of these services. He will be judged harshly if
he comes down on the wrong side of it.''

THE Government's policies on the privatisation of public utilities
came under fresh attack last night by Labour's Trade and Industry
spokesman Dr Jack Cunningham.
In a debate initiated by his party -- which concentrated on the
Government's decision not to refer the hostile bid by Trafalgar House
for Northern Electric to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission -- Dr
Cunningham said Labour's motion referred to widespread public concern.
It reflected contempt on the part of consumers and employees alike for
a Government whose privatisation policies had left them wide open to
exploitation.
Dr Cunningham referred to the huge pay rises awarded to those in
charge of privatised utilities and told the House it was an abuse of the
Government's stewardship.
This had been condemned by the public, the press, consumer watchdogs
and successful directors in the private sector, but which Board of Trade
President Michael Heseltine ''condones and even privately believes in.''
Dr Cunningham said people were concerned about the abuse of monopoly
power and said that experience had confirmed that electricity
privatisation had created a ''licence to print money.''
The background to the debate was the increasing concern about the
amount of remuneration and share options being given to those in charge
of privatised utilities and the possible predatory instincts of those
who may wish to take over the power companies.
Latest figures show that the 12 privatised regional electricity
companies in England and Wales had handed out share options worth more
than #50m to 65 directors -- more than #750,000 per director.
In Scotland, the windfall is reported to have been largely for four
directors of ScottishPower, who hold share options worth somewhere
around #3.5m according to recent figures.
For the Government, Mr Heseltine sought to belittle Labour's argument
and stuck firmly to the Government's line applauding the improvements in
the performance of the electricity supply industry since privatisation.
He also urged the House to welcome the benefits consumers were
receiving in terms of lower prices and improved services and to
''support the continuing development of competition in the electricity
market and the maintencance of effective regulation where this is
necessary.''
In a statement issued at Westminster last night, SNP leader Alex
Salmond expressed fresh concern about what the Trafalgar House decision
could mean for the Scottish electricity companies.
He said: ''My worry would be that this decision is a declaration of
open season on any electricity company, including Hydro-Electric and
ScottishPower. It is clear that the DTI did not even consult the
Scottish Office before they decided against referral, which does not
augur well for the long-term independence of the Scottish companies.
''The Government has given a signal that any electricity company is
fair game.''

<TEXT>
THE Government was defeated last night as the Lords backed a move to
base the State Earnings-Related Pension on the best 44 years' earnings
rather than the Government's proposed 49 years.
The amendment, during the Pensions Bill's committee stage, was carried
by 105 to 61, a majority of 44.
The Government will now have to decide whether to reverse the vote
when the measure returns to the Commons.
A Social Security Department spokesman said after the defeat: ''We
will have to take this away and look at it very closely.''
The ''ambush'' by Labour and Liberal Democrat peers appeared to take
the Government by surprise.
Baroness Hollis of Heigham, for Labour, said afterwards that it meant
that even if both men and women had to work to the age of 65, future
entitlement to Serps would be calculated on the best 44 years' earnings
rather than 49.
The Bill equalises the state pension age at 65.
She said: ''Women's employment is almost always interrupted by family
responsibilities. Men's employment can be interrupted for a number of
reasons.
''The Government is trying to deny a full State Earnings Related
pension to most women and to some vulnerable men by its insistence that
after equalisation at 65 women and men will both have to make
contributions over 49 years to qualify.
''Under this Bill, women would have to wait five years longer for
their pension and often would get a lower pension as a result. This is
because Serps is averaged over the whole working life and women's
earnings often fall off during the last years which further depresses
their pension.
''This vote tonight means that we have struck a blow to redress the
balance.''
Liberal Democrat social security spokesman Alex Carlile (Montgomery)
said the Government's defeat ''means victory for the low-paid''.
He added: ''This will give more low-paid workers, women and those with
broken working patterns a chance to qualify for a full state pension
when they retire.''
Social Security Minister of State Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish told
peers during the debate that the amendment would cancel out the effects
of moving the Serps working life for women to that which currently
applies to men.
The 44-year option would ensure the current position remained for most
women while representing a significant improvement for men and bring
benefit to many better-off men.
The Government's scheme, he argued, would ''ensure the continued
affordability of the scheme into the future while protecting the
position of vulnerable groups''.

LABOUR last night criticised a pay contract which could see the

NatWest is expected to announce today that it made pre-tax profits of
about #1.5 billion last year, according to the Financial Times.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said: ''Once again we find that pay
restraint among low and middle income Britain is not being matched by
greater responsibility in the boardrooms.
''We now see that directors of privatised utilities are not alone in
granting themselves large pay increases.
''In future, these kinds of executive pay packages should be paid only
with explicit and prior approval through a vote of all shareholders.''
SEVEN members of a CBI investigation into high pay among company
executives have themselves been paid nearly #4m in salary and dividends
by their own firms, it is claimed today.
Between them the seven industrialists, part of an 11-strong CBI team,
earned #3.9m in their companies' latest financial year, according to the
independent trade union and labour movement organisation Labour
Research.
Labour employment spokesman Ian McCartney said: ''Putting these people
in charge of an investigation into the executive pay bonanza is hardly
likely to give the public confidence that business is serious about
dealing with the problem.''
LABOUR also protested last night when Armed Forces Minister Nicholas
Soames disclosed that staff costs for the official Service residence in
Gibraltar are running at #175,000 a year, Armed Forces Minister Nicholas
Soames said last night.
The spending, disclosed in a Commons written reply, came under
immediate attack from Labour's Stephen Byers, who condemned it as ''yet
another example of senior military figures enjoying a luxury lifestyle
at the taxpayers' expense''.
Mr Soames said in response to a question from Mr Byers that 12 staff
were employed in the Gibraltar residence. Their duties included
''valeting, cleaning, cooking, waiting at table and gardening''.

THE Commons Select Committee on Transport is expected to express
doubts today over the Government's plans to privatise British air
traffic control services, including the vital transatlantic centre at
Prestwick.
In particular, the committee is expected to recommend in a report that
outright privatisation be avoided in favour of public ownership on a
commercial basis, in order to preserve safety in the skies above the UK.
It is also understood to have come down in favour of preserving the
current two-centre system, at Prestwick and West Drayton in England,
providing reassurance to those who feared privatisation would mean the
closure of the Prestwick facility.
The committee's inquiry into air traffic control follows the
Government's decision to press ahead in the next session of Parliament
with privatisation of the National Air Traffic Services (Nats).
The system, which tracks hundreds of flights to, from, and across the
UK, would be sold off and become a privately- run contractor to the
Civil Aviation Authority.
However, the committee is expected to ask the Government to justify
further its policy, and in particular its decision not to turn Nats into
a profit-making, commercially-run public sector company, as recommended
by the majority of bodies who gave evidence.
Trade unions have emphasised that privatising Nats will threaten the
security of flights across some of the world's busiest air routes. They
have argued that Britain is the only country to propose selling off its
Nats service.
In New Zealand, the United States and elsewhere, privatisation has
been discarded in favour of placing the service on a commercial but
publicly owned footing.
Mr Doug McLean, public relations officer for the air traffic
controllers union, based at Prestwick said: ''We very much welcomed the
inquiry. We put to them major concerns about safety and about the
efficiency of an integrated service from Shetland to Heathrow.
''We would be very disappointed if the committee didn't recognise
these strengths in the present system and we hope to be able to
participate in any further debate which arises from this report.''
With air traffic volumes set to increase by as much as 100% in the
next decade, it is understood that the committee will recommend the need
to maintain an independent and strong safety regulator supervising Nats
services, and that the CAA's Safety Regulation Group be transferred to a
separate body.
Labour MP Brian Donohoe, one of the committee's members, said last
night: ''We have worked hard at this report. We hope that the Government
will take notice of its contents and certainly when it is made public I
will be making very strong arguments for the continuation of air traffic
control at Prestwick.''

LOCAL authorities this week are being asked to back a campaign by
Strathclyde region for changes to the law to give councils more power to
deal swiftly with substandard private residential homes.
The region has referred a number of recommendations to the Convention
of Scottish Local Authorities in the light of a review of procedures by
its officials.
It took the region four years to close the Glenglova residential home
in Glasgow, where a sheriff said frail and confused elderly residents
were kept as human livestock for money.
The sheriff also criticised the actions of regional council social
workers over some aspects of the case.
Over the past two years, enforcement action has been taken by
Strathclyde in relation to a number of registered homes which have
consistently failed to meet registration standards.
At present, there are 335 registered homes in the region, including
156 for elderly people.
Three homes have had their registration cancelled and another three
are the subject of enforcement actions. In addition, there are a small
number of homes where formal action is under consideration.
There are nine steps to be taken before actual closure of a home.
Strathclyde is now proposing that a general power should be given to
councils to remove residents where there is reasonable cause to consider
their welfare to be at risk.
The region wants the power to make arrangements for the interim
management of a home where necessary, and says that an appeal by a
proprietor to the Secretary of State should be heard within 56 days.
It also wants the Scottish Office to examine any circumstances where a
conflict of interest might arise. For example, it feels that proprietors
who are doctors should not be able to act as general practitioners to
residents.
Strathclyde's proposals will be discussed by social work chiefs at a
meeting in Edinburgh on Friday. It is expected they will first agree to
seek the formal views of all council social work departments.
If a consensus for legislative change emerged, Cosla would then raise
the matter with the Scottish Office.

A PUNTER'S bid to beat bookmakers stood to net him #94,000 for an #11
stake, Linlithgow Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
However, the huge winnings made the Tote bookmakers, of Whitburn, West
Lothian, suspicious. Yesterday, James Reilly, of Ireland Avenue,
Whitburn, was ordered to perform 200 hours' community service after he
admitted charges of fraud.
Reilly bet on football results the day after the games were played.
His first attempt was successful, winning him more than #300 by betting
on five results.
A week later, on September 1 last year, Reilly went for the jackpot
when he bet on 10 games played the day before.
Because of the size of the winnings, the coupon was double checked and
it was noticed that the results were known before the bet has been
placed.
It was only then that a check was made and the earlier bet was
uncovered.

A SHERIFF was unable to order one of a pair of Rottweilers to be
destroyed because no-one knew which of them had bitten a disabled man.
Mr James McCann, defending, told Glasgow Sheriff Court that the
culprit could have been either nine-year-old Caesar or Farah, aged
eight.
No-one saw which dog bit 41-year-old Ronald Anderson.
Sheriff John Baird said that, because of this, he was unable to impose
a destruction order.
He admonished James McColgan, 54, of Attlee Avenue, Clydebank, and
ordered him to pay #300 compensation to Mr Anderson, whose address was
given as c/o the police.
Earlier, McColgan admitted being in control of the dogs on a path near
the Forth and Clyde Canal in Blairdarie, Glasgow, when one of them bit
Mr Anderson.
Miss Carol Duncan, prosecuting, said Mr Anderson had asked McColgan
for directions. The dogs became excited and one of them bit Mr Anderson
on the legs. Mr McCann said McColgan had been looking after the dogs for
his son.

HOUSING officials will this week consider a proposal from Dundee
District Council that anti-social tenants should be dealt with by
informal tribunals rather than sheriff courts.
A report to the housing committee of the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities speaks of ''a groundswell of concern'' about such behaviour
and seeks the best approach councils could take.
Last week, the Graham family lost its appeal in Kirkcaldy Sheriff
Court against an eviction order sought by Glenrothes Development
Corporation.
During last year's eviction action, it was claimed that neighbours of
the Grahams had suffered years of misery because of their anti-social
behaviour.
Dundee District Council's principal solicitor, Mr Philip Forte, claims
there is a widely perceived failure of the legal system to deal
adequately with the problem.
He is proposing in a report that more informal and flexible tribunals,
similar to those used to settle workplace disputes, should replace
formal legal procedures when dealing with complaints about tenants.
The formal rules of evidence in court procedures would not apply but a
framework of appropriate tribunal practices could be evolved.
Dundee district also believes that changes in the present law are
needed. It is calling for the abolition or shortening of the 28-day time
limit between serving notice on a tenant and lodging an eviction
summons.
It also calls for the reduction of the legal rights and legal
protections of secure tenants which can hamper the council's efforts to
secure an eviction.
A second report, also by Mr Forte, stresses the need for extra
resources to deal with the problems of delays in sheriff courts.
Cosla's housing committee is expected to authorise a survey of the
views of all authorities before drawing up a comprehensive paper.

THE gun that shot and killed retired mining engineer David Dunn at
point blank range, as he tackled fleeing bank robbers, was linked
yesterday to murder accused Robert Smith.
However, the Glock pistol had a fault which meant that the safety
mechanism was not working properly, the Bonnyrigg murder trial was told.
The jury has already heard that the Glock pistol was found in
undergrowth, after Mr Smith emerged from bushes where he has been hiding
after a #185,000 robbery at the Bank of Scotland, in Bonnyrigg,
Midlothian, on October 19 last year.
Mr Smith, 33, along with co-accused Mr Gerald McQuade, 40, and Mr Paul
Bootland, 25, deny murdering Mr Dunn, of Dalhousie Drive, Bonnyrigg, in
a car park near the bank. They also deny attempting to murder Constable
John Duffy and two members of the public in the car park.
Constable Peter Sibbald, a firearms expert, told the High Court in
Edinburgh that, after the bank robbery, he had examined three guns -- a
Webley revolver, a Browning semi-automatic pistol, and a Glock pistol.
Mr Duffy told the court earlier that Mr McQuade fired the revolver
twice at him, as he grappled with him in the car park. There has also
been evidence that, when Mr Bootland was detained at the scene, a
Browning was found near to where he had been pinned to the ground.
Dealing with the revolver, Mr Sibbald said that, when it was examined,
two bullets were discovered lodged in the barrel, which was unusual. He
could not give an exact explanation as to why this had happened.
The Browning was in good condition and, when he examined it, there
were 13 live rounds inside which had not been fired.
Test firing on the Glock revealed a fault in the gun which meant it
would fire once every four or five times, when it should have been in a
safe condition. The gun had a bulge, approximately two inches from the
breech end, around which were stress fractures.
Asked about the bulge, Mr Sibbald said: ''I can only assume it has
been formed by some sort of blockage in the barrel.''
He told the court that three live bullets from the gun had been found
in and around the bank robbers' Ford Granada getaway car.
Mr Sibbald said he believed the gun had misfired three times and that
two bullets recovered from Mr Dunn's body had been fired in tandem from
the Glock.
He thought the first bullet had jammed in the barrel and when the
second was fired it propelled both bullets out. ''We cannot say what has
caused it to block in the barrel.''
From examining Mr Dunn's clothing, Mr Sibbald estimated that he had
been shot at a range of between two and 12 inches.
Cross-examined by Mr Derek Ogg, counsel for Mr Smith, the officer said
that police forces used the Glock pistol and he had heard of examples
when the gun double fired.
The trial continues.

<HEADLINE>Scottish education faces the axe. National forum warns that funding squeeze could cut public sector provision</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S education service could suffer its most severe cuts for
more than a decade, it was claimed yesterday.
The warning came from the Forum on Scottish Education -- an
organisation covering 22 bodies including the Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities, the Educational Institute of Scotland and other
teachers' unions, the Church of Scotland's education committee, and the
Catholic Education Commission (Scotland) as well as parent-teacher
groups.
The Rev John Taylor, forum chairman, said in Edinburgh that the whole
Scottish public education sector would be squeezed savagely by the
Government, because the Government would not provide additional funding
for already negotiated pay deals and there was no conceivable efficiency
that could meet the extra costs.
He claimed that, though the details were not yet settled, it appeared
very likely that class sizes would increase, support services would
diminish, and services such as community and outdoor education and
pre-five education would be drastically cut or even abolished.
Mr Taylor said the new unitary local authorities, which come into
being in 1996, would inherit a decimated education service from the
present regional authorities.
He added that the shadow authorities, which will be elected this
April, would have no administrative responsibility for 12 months.
Unless the Government's revenue support grant was fully sensitive to
the extent of poverty and deprivation in each new education authority
area, which seemed unlikely, there could be a further serious
deterioration in education provision next year, Mr Taylor warned.
The forum believed, he said, that the priority to be given to
educational spending would be a major issue at the next General
Election.
The present Government should hold this in mind before cutting the
funding to education in the lead-up to the election.
Mr Taylor said publicity had been focused on the Government's refusal
to fund pay increases for teachers in England and Wales, which may have
given them the impression that there were no problems in Scotland.
He said that an identical ''no funding'' situation applied to the
negotiated settlement reached by Scottish teachers towards the end of
last year and the negotiated increases for non-teaching staff.
The Government's view that all pay increases in the public sector had
to be paid for through ''efficiency'' was cynical in the extreme, he
claimed.
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard yesterday dampened expectations
of extra provision to fund teachers' pay rises when she urged schools to
make better use of the money they had.
She told headteachers and businessmen at a conference in London:
''Effective financial management means considering the cost and
opportunities of alternative plans.''
Mrs Shephard gave examples of schools coming together to pool ideas
about how to make money go further. She added that the Department for
Education would be studying results from a pilot exercise on financial
co-operation in London.
''We hope it will demonstrate a practical way to help schools use
their devolved budgets to greatest effect,'' she said.
Mrs Shephard was speaking at a conference organised by the Industrial
Society, as alarm grew about the consequences of this year's financial
settlement and unfunded 2.7% teachers' pay rise.
Many local authorities say the award will result in bigger classes and
lost teaching jobs. Headteachers told the Minister that many schools
would find it difficult to make ends meet without more money, no matter
how much they improved efficiency.
However, Mrs Shephard said that some warnings about the impact on
education were already not being borne out.
She pointed to two local authorities -- Leicestershire and Devon --
which had said they would not be able to fund the pay award, but had
then found the necessary money to do so.
Mrs Shephard is said to be still trying to win extra assistance from
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke.
Comments she made last week gave rise to expectations that money could
be targeted on those authorities ''where the shoe is pinching most''.
Labour education spokesman, Mr David Blunkett MP, later accused Mrs
Shephard of presiding over ''chaos'' in classrooms because of the
Government's failure to fund teachers' pay.
''We need action, not words, from Gillian Shephard if we are to raise
standards in our schools,'' he said.

A MAN who attacked and robbed a wheelchair-bound pensioner with whom
he had been drinking in a pub was jailed for 22 months yesterday.
Mr Albert McPhail, 67, was left with his face covered in blood after
falling out of his wheelchair as James O'Brien repeatedly punched him in
the face and took #200, Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told.
When O'Brien, 35, was caught by police three days later, he was
carrying a newspaper cutting about the assault.
O'Brien, of Saughton Mains Terrace, Edinburgh, admitted assaulting and
robbing Mr McPhail in the public toilets in Canongate, Edinburgh.
Depute-fiscal Brian Robertson told the court that the two men met in a
pub and Mr McPhail bought several drinks for O'Brien.
Mr McPhail, who had a leg amputated several years ago, then said he
needed more money and asked O'Brien to push him to a cash machine.
After getting the money, the two men were going to get something to
eat at a place suggested by O'Brien.
''Mr McPhail was even prepared to buy the accused a meal,'' said Mr
Robertson. O'Brien pushed Mr McPhail along Canongate and, as they got to
the toilets, grabbed him, making him fall out of his wheelchair, and
started punching him.
At hospital, Mr McPhail was treated for a broken nose and bruising and
swelling around both eyes.
O'Brien still had #70 of Mr McPhail's money when he was caught and
told police that he had ''just gone daft''.
Solicitor Alex Prentice said: ''The amount of alcohol and the sight of
the money proved too much for him at the time.''
Mr Prentice claimed that O'Brien's memory of the incident was not good
and it was only when he saw the newspaper that he realised fully what he
had done.
He added that O'Brien had since got a job as a cleaner and had saved
up #300, which he wanted Mr McPhail to have.

A POLICEMAN, cleared yesterday of raping a female colleague at a Toffs
and Tarts party, spoke last night of his anger over the allegation.
Police Constable Michael Seear also said he found it ''unbelievable''
that the policewoman involved was likely to remain in the force.
Although pleased the ordeal was over, he said outside court: ''I
suppose I do feel angry. I still cannot understand why the allegation
was made.''
He said he had not been able to sleep or eat properly during the 10
months the allegation had hung over him. ''I think this applies to my
family as well,'' he said, adding that he did not think the case should
have been brought.
His remarks came after the senior investigating officer in the case --
Detective Superintendent Rodger Hawkins -- said that, as far as he was
concerned, both officers would be welcome back on duty.
0 Both would be given every help to rebuild their lives and the force
would also look with care at the future posting of the two officers.
Mr Seear, 25, from Lightwater, Surrey, had denied raping the
policewoman, also 25, at the end of a New Year's Eve party at a police
section house in 1993.
She had alleged that Mr Seear asked her to help him back to his room,
as he was drunk. Once there, she alleged, he had locked her in and
attacked her violently, leaving bruises on her breasts, arm, and neck.
She claimed that her boyfriend -- also a policeman -- was furious when
he saw the marks and had questioned her about them.
Three months later, the policewoman made a formal complaint to a
senior officer after her boyfriend's continuing questions.
It was the beginning of a nightmare, according to Mr Seear. ''I
couldn't understand what was going on,'' he said. He was suspended,
ordered to leave the section house he shared with other young
constables, and charged with rape.
He denied intercourse had occurred and described as a ''complete
fabrication'' the policewoman's claim that he had suddenly changed when
he reached his room and had raped her.
Yesterday, Mr Seear said he was now determined to get on with his job.
''It has been a very difficult 10 months. I hope to get back to duty
very soon.''

A PROPOSAL for a new Clause 4 to the Labour constitution -- which
commits the party to social ownership of essential public services --
has been sent to constituency Labour parties.
The latest contribution to the constitutional debate comes from the
New Agenda group of Labour MPs, which includes Western Isles MP Calum
Macdonald. The group identifies itself with the modernising wing of the
party.
Their six-paragraph version of Clause 4 would replace the 1918
version, which commits the party to the common ownership of the means of
production, distribution and exchange.
Its essentials define Labour as a democratic socialist party,
emphasise opportunity and democracy and social solidarity. Its key
declaration on economics states: ''Labour is committed to a sustainable
economy that provides wealth and work for all and combines efficiency
with social justice.
''We hold that this is best achieved by a partnership economy, with
dynamic markets and active government in the public interest, including
social ownership of essential public services.''
The group's proposal adds to the contributions to the Clause 4 debate
received by the party leadership. Leader Tony Blair and deputy leader
John Prescott are expected to produce a definitive version of the new
Clause 4, based on the consultation, by the middle of next month.
Meanwhile, the conflict within the party over rewriting Clause 4 will
reach new intensity today with warring sides preparing to fight it out
at Westminster.
While Mr Blair brings his campaign for reform to London, socialist and
film director Ken Loach -- who has threatened to resign his party
membership if Clause 4 is abandoned -- will present a 15-minute video on
behalf of the Defend Clause 4 campaign.
Mr Macdonald said the debate over Clause 4 was ''healthy and
educational''. The consultation period was an opportunity for those with
views on the future of the party to express them.
''It is time to restate those values that pushed us to join the party
in the first place. People are realising that they didn't join the party
because it promised to nationalise everything that moves,'' he said.
Other members of the New Agenda group are MPs Tony Wright, Nick
Raynsford, Anne Campbell, Jeff Rooker, John Gunnell, Judith Church,
Margaret Hodge and Malcolm Wicks.

A STRONG Labour and trade union delegation, armed with a threat of a
boycott of Bulgarian products, appears to have broken the deadlock over
the scandal of Bulgarian seafarers stranded in Shetland because of a pay
dispute with their government.
The delegation to the Bulgarian embassy was led by Ms Joyce Quin,
Shadow European Minister, Ms Joan Walley, Shadow Minister of Shipping,
and Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT rail and seafarers'
union. It included some of the seafarers and representatives from the
TUC, the International Transport Workers' Federation, and Shetland Trade
Council.
Ambassador Stefan Tafrov was urged to use his best offices to help
resolve the dispute with the 31 crew members of the factory ship
Rotalia, who complain they have not been paid properly for three years.
During several hours of discussion, Ambassador Tafrov said they would
be paid on their return and that no legal action would be taken against
them.
He also agreed that the ITF would be recognised by Bulgaria -- a move
which opens the way for formal talks between the ITF and the Bulgarian
shipowner Okeanski Ribolov, which is ultimately owned by the state.
Mr Knapp said afterwards that until there was a full settlement of the
dispute the threat of a boycott call being made at the forthcoming
Scottish Labour Party conference still stood.
Shetland islanders began supplying the crew with food and clothes
after the Bulgarian Government cut off food supplies when the crew went
on strike over unpaid wages last month.
Earlier, authorities on the islands declared that the Rotalia was
unfit to sail from Lerwick.
Shetland Trades Council spokesman Peter Hamilton, who accompanied the
Bulgarians on the 1600-mile round trip to London, said: ''The men can't
feed their families on promises. The shipowner has stopped payments to
the families in Bulgaria. They are now living in poverty.''

SAS soldiers who shot dead three IRA terrorists in Gibraltar were
described in a court yesterday as an indiscriminate killing machine.
A lawyer for the relatives of the victims told human rights judges in
Strasbourg: ''In effect, the British Government pulled the trigger on
the three suspects.''
The 18 judges were hearing the latest round in the legal battle over
the so-called Death on the Rock shootings seven years ago.
Mairead Farrell, Daniel McCann, and Sean Savage were killed in March
1988 after being tracked in Gibraltar by soldiers acting on information
that the three were members of an IRA active service unit preparing a
bomb attack.
A Gibraltar inquest jury found that the three had been lawfully killed
but the human rights court has been asked to rule their deaths were a
breach of the Human Rights Convention.
Mr Niall Farrell, brother of Mairead, was in court in Strasbourg
yesterday to hear Dutch lawyer Douwe Korff, representing the victims'
families, describe the way the SAS operates.
''These were soldiers trained to shoot at the merest hint of a threat,
and were trained to go on shooting until that threat was removed. Those
who trained and briefed the SAS primed a machine to do what they did, to
kill.''
Mr Korff insisted the SAS men were acting on flawed information: ''In
effect, the British Government pulled the trigger on the three
suspects.''
However, British Government lawyer, Mr Stephen Richards, said the
tracking of the three IRA suspects had been based on a reported find of
bomb-making material. He said it was also believed that the three were
armed and in possession of a remote bomb detonator.
''If they had succeeded, the consequences would have been a
devastating loss of life. The soldiers acted on honest and reasonable
assumptions,'' he said.
He said the soldiers involved in the killing have always denied they
had been ordered to kill, either directly or by a ''nod and wink''.
Mr Richards declared: ''That would have been murder.''
He added that the soldiers accepted the accuracy of information
honestly gathered by others and he claimed the authorities could act
only on the basis of available information.
The soldiers have always denied that they used unnecessary force and
that they continued shooting when the three were about to surrender or
were lying injured on the ground.
The Human Rights Commission has delivered an opinion by a 11-6
majority that the shootings could be ''considered as absolutely
necessary for the legitimate aim of the defence of others from unlawful
violence''.
However, the Human Rights Court is being urged to overturn that
decision and rule the killings violated Article Two of the Human Rights
Convention that: ''Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law.''
A final verdict is not expected until later this year.

SEVEN top industrialists investigating excessive pay awards among
company executives received nearly #4m from their own firms last year
according to Labour Research, which suggests this is like putting
Dracula in charge of a blood bank.
The all-party Commons employment committee examining directors'
remuneration will hear evidence today from Mr Howard Davies, director
general of the CBI, which has set up a study group to advise on the
issue.
The 11-strong group includes seven industrialists who between them
earned #3.9m from pay, dividends, and share option profits in their
companies' latest financial year.
Chairing the study group is Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks
and Spencer, whose basic salary last year was #629,588. He also received
a #59,350 bonus, #2015 in dividends, and a further #465,057 in profit on
share options.
Sir Richard is also a non-executive director of Lloyds Bank and
pharmaceuticals company, Zeneca, where he will receive between #15,000
and #25,000 a year. In both cases, he sits on the committees which
decide the salaries of the top executives.
Other members of the study group include BT chairman, Sir Iain
Vallance, who got #652,853; BP chief executive and chairman designate,
Mr David Simon, on #634,076; GKN chairman, Sir David Lees, who got
#339,386; Whitbread non-executive chairman, Sir Michael Angus, #155,485,
and Mr George Metcalf, chairman of UMECO, with #124,683.
The public furore over executive pay looks set to continue for some
time yet, with the focus soon to revert to British Gas chief executive
Mr Cedric Brown, whose 75% rise sparked the row. The annual meeting of
British Gas later this month promises to be lively.

WEEKS after being freed from a custody sentence, so-called Safari Boy,
18-year-old Mark Hook, led police on a high-speed chase through a city
centre, a court heard yesterday.
Two cyclists narrowly escaped being hit by Hook -- dubbed the Safari
Boy after it was revealed he had been sent on holiday to Kenya and Egypt
at public expense a year ago.
Yesterday, Gloucester magistrates were told that Hook was pursued by a
police car through the city's narrow streets in a silver Honda car.
The chase ended with the car mounting a pavement and hitting a road
sign, and Hook running off, said Mr Adrian Phillips, prosecuting.
The incident happened within weeks of Hook's release from a nine-month
youth custody sentence, imposed last September for handling stolen
goods.
Hook pleaded guilty yesterday to dangerous driving and driving while
disqualified and having no insurance.
He was remanded on bail until March 28 for a pre-sentence report. A
condition of bail is that he lives with his father in Gloucester, and
stays indoors between 8pm and 6am.

SIR David Steel was known as The Boy David after being elected
Britain's youngest MP at 26, at the start of a parliamentary career that
led to leadership of the Liberal Party at the age of 38. Yesterday, the
Liberal Democrats introduced another young man in his twenties who, at
the next election, will fight the Borders seat which Sir David has held
for 30 years.
Mr Michael Moore, 29, above with Sir David, works as an accountant
with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Edinburgh, and has more than his youth in
common with The Boy David. Both are sons of Church of Scotland
ministers. Mr Moore's father, the Rev Haisley Moore, is full-time
secretary of the Scottish Boys' Brigade.
As Sir David, at his home, Aikwood Tower, near Selkirk, introduced Mr
Moore, he joked: ''Actually he's starting a bit late in life.'' The
prospective candidate, selected over 17 others in a ballot of
constituency party members, has already had a taste of Parliament. After
graduating from Edinburgh University with a degree in politics and
history, he spent a year as a researcher on the Westminster staff of the
Borders' other Liberal Democrat MP, Archy Kirkwood. He had an early
start in politics when he became a party worker while a pupil at
Jedburgh Grammar School.
Mr Moore faces a tough battle to hold the Tweeddale, Ettrick, and
Lauderdale seat. At the last election, the Lib Dems' majority fell 10%
to 2520, ahead of the Tories. Boundary Commission changes mean that
Penicuik, which has a strong Labour vote, will now make up a quarter of
the votes in the redrawn constituency.
Sir David said: ''I have always regarded this as a marginal seat.'' Mr
Moore added: ''We will be working to get across the message that voting
Liberal Democrat is a clear way of not letting in the Tories in this
part of the world.''

A LEADING shinty player is to be questioned by police after an alleged
assault on a match referee.
The captain of Lovat, Roddy Munro, faces a possible life ban from the
sport after he was sent off during Saturday's cup match with Fort
William.
Referee Donald MacFadyen, from Inverness, suffered a cut lip and
bruised mouth.
Fort William won 5-0 at the village of Kiltarlity, near Inverness.
Yesterday, Mr MacFadyen, who refused to abandon the match despite his
injuries, would not give details of the incident but said he had not
reported the matter to the police.
A police spokesman confirmed yesterday: ''We will investigate an
incident which took place on Saturday during the Lovat versus Fort
William tie.''
He added: ''It is not clear yet whether a report will be submitted to
the procurator-fiscal. Inquiries are ongoing.''
Shinty's referees' association will be taking a close interest in the
police inquiry: it withdrew a threat of strike action early this season
when it received assurances from the governing body, the Camanachd
Association, after an alleged incident in Skye.
Shinty, sometimes described as ''clan warfare without the claymores'',
is well known as an all-action, rough and tumble sport with frequent
injuries, but assaults on referees are rare.
One referee said yesterday: ''If it is proved that the player cut the
referee with his stick, then we have to be looking at a life ban. This
is the test of the Camanachd Association's claim it will do more to
protect referees.''
Munro, 28, has been an inspirational player for first division Lovat
this season.
The incident is understood to have occurred after a Lovat player was
the victim of an off-the-ball incident.
Lovat are tipped to make it into shinty's new all-Scotland Premier
League next season.

A CLIMBER and a cross-country skier were still missing last night as
hopes of finding them alive in treacherous conditions were rapidly
diminishing.
A scaled-down search will resume this morning for cross-country skier
Andrew Wilson from Croftfoot, Glasgow, who has now been missing for
three nights in blizzard conditions at Cairnwell, near Braemar.
Another search for climber Anthony Marsh, 40, from Manchester, missing
on Ben Nevis, was called off yesterday because of the weather. It is
unlikely to go ahead today either because of the avalanche risk.
Nearly 100 people, five dogs, and a helicopter were involved in the
search for Mr Wilson, an experienced cross-country skier who was said to
be well equipped, but as Sergeant Graham Gibb, co-ordinator of the
rescue operation, pointed out: ''He was well equipped for a day in the
hills but whether it is enough for three days in these conditions
remains to be seen.''
Weather conditions are poor, with high winds and heavy snow showers
frequently creating blizzards.
''Conditions out there are unbelievable,'' said Mr Gibb. ''The chill
factor is down to minus 35C and it is very hard for the teams to operate
other than just surviving the conditions.
''They are having to concentrate very hard but the conditions are so
bad it is very frustrating. You could have passed a few feet from
someone and missed them. It is impossible to carry out a proper search.
''The teams were out for 24 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday and they
had just two days break before they were called out on Saturday, and
they have been out ever since. The members of the civilian teams cannot
afford any more time off from their jobs, never mind the time they need
to recuperate, and we will now scale it down.''
The search is being concentrated in the Cairn of Claise and Carn an
Tuirc areas west of Cairnwell Ski Centre. As well as the Grampian Police
and Braemar mountain rescue teams, Tayside Police, Aberdeen montain
rescue, and RAF Leuchars teams were involved yesterday. They were helped
by the Search and Rescue Dog Association and a Navy helicopter from HMS
Gannet.
On Ben Nevis, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team began their search for
missing climber Mr Marsh on Saturday night and continued on Sunday, but
weather conditions prevented the search being resumed yesterday.
Mr Marsh, an accountant, has been missing since Saturday, when he is
thought to have fallen through a snow cornice.
* The search for the angler missing, presumed drowned, on Loch Lomond
will continue today. Police divers, search and rescue dog handlers, the
Luss rescue boat, Lomond Mountain Rescue Team, and the Strathclyde
Police helicopter scoured the loch yesterday for Mr Alistair McQuilkie,
37, of Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, whose boat overturned on Saturday.
The body of his companion Mr William Ballantyne, 45, also of Alexandria,
was found on Sunday.

THE taste-buds of the croissant connoisseurs will be tingling over the
news that Glasgow Airport's award-winning baked delights come frozen
from France.
Egon Ronay, the celebrated food expert, christened the croissants,
baked at the airport's Granary restaurant and weighing in at an ounce,
as the lightest out of all BAA airports.
At the announcement yesterday of the inter-airport catering
competition reslts, Mr Ronay said: ''Before judging this competition I
would never have believed that I should find the lightest croissant in
Glasgow, equalling those in Paris.''
Easy really, when you consider they are made by artisans just outside
Paris, frozen and shipped by Delice De France to their Wandsworth base
then sold to the Granary's food wholesaler, Puritan Maid.
In fact, Puritan Maid distribute the same croissants to Heathrow and
Gatwick, also competing for the accolade.
There was more good news for Scottish airport food at an awards lunch
in Claridge's. Brothy's restaurant at Aberdeen Airport has won the prize
for the friendliest service. Cafe Select at Edinburgh Airport was
narrowly beaten for best cappuccino. However, Edinburgh did win an award
for the most exciting sandwich.
The staff of Glasgow Airport's Granary restaurant were jubilant
yesterday and insisted the secret was not in the manufacture but in the
baking, which is 16 minutes at 175C.
Ms Caroline Paul, deputy general manager, said: ''We buy in a frozen,
unprepared product and bake them here. But it's all in the baking. Too
long and they're rock hard and too little and they're soft.''
Egon Ronay cooked up the results with his team of inspectors after
testing between them 16,500 items of food and drink.

THE pop band Blur were named top British artists of the year in the
annual Brit Awards.
They also picked up three other awards, making them the first band to
take four prizes in the top event in the pop music calendar.
Best album for Parklife, best video, and best single made it a clean
sweep for the four-piece band from Colchester, Essex.
The ceremony took place last night at London's Alexandra Palace, with
Madonna heading the line-up after snubbing the show three years ago.
Elton John received a Lifetime Achievement award for his outstanding
contribution to the music industry.
Paul Weller, former leader of The Jam and The Style Council, was named
best British solo artist, narrowly beating Eric Clapton, Seal,
Morrissey, and Elvis Costello.
The ceremony will be broadcast on ITV tonight and screened in more
than 53 countries over the next two months.
The awards, sponsored by Britannia Music, have attracted controversy
in the past.
Last year, there was a vote-rigging scandal when the Electoral Reform
Society alleged block-voting. The awards are voted on by an ''academy''
of 500 people, largely from the record industry.
Best British female solo artist was Eddi Reader, formerly lead singer
with Fairground Attraction.
Best British dance act was M People and best British newcomer was
Oasis.
The film soundtrack prize was won by Oscar-nominated Pulp Fiction,
starring John Travolta, beating The Lion King, Four Weddings and a
Funeral, Forrest Gump, and Philadelphia.
Nellee Hooper won best British producer for work with Madonna, among
many other stars.
Tony Mortimer, star of East 17, performed with his band from a
wheelchair after falling off the stage during rehearsals.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke signalled defiance of the Tory Eurosceptics
yesterday when he announced Britain would play a ''constructive'' role
in the preparations for a European single currency.
His statement to EU Finance Ministers was taken as a sign of his
determination not to be gagged on the subject, although he was at pains
to persuade reporters he was merely stating long-established Government
policy and no more.
However, he was urged to stand down by leading Tory Eurosceptic Bill
Cash, who said he no longer had confidence in him as Chancellor.
''I think the key question here is whether he would not be better off
arguing his case honorably from the back benches in order to enable him
to express his views freely in the kind of debate he says he wants,'' Mr
Cash added.
He said the Prime Minister would then be able to show the leadership
needed to end the strife within the party by declaring Britain would not
join a single European currency.
Mr John Major has demanded that his divided Cabinet becomes more
reticent on the subject of Britain abandoning the pound in favour of the
ecu by the end of the century.
Mr Clarke reinforced his reputation in the Council of Economic and
Finance Ministers as a pro-European when he assured his colleagues that
Britain would ''certainly play a constructive part'' in the run-up to
economic and monetary union (Emu).
He was praised by several Ministers, including Mr Jean-Claude Juncker,
the new Luxembourg premier, who said the Chancellor was on a
pro-European track. ''We must support him,'' Mr Juncker said.
One Irish diplomat later described Mr Clarke as ''courageous''.
Mr Clarke's comment followed confirmation that the Treasury was
already deeply involved in the preparations for a single currency,
despite the fact that, at Maastricht, Mr Major negotiated the right to
opt out of the plan and leave a final decision on joining to Parliament.
Mr Clarke told reporters: ''I did not expect my colleagues to take any
more than a passing interest in what I said because it was so
predictable.'' Mr Clarke repeated his well-known view that a single
currency was probably impossible by 1997 or even 1999.
Meanwhile, the British controversy over the single currency cut little
ice with the pro-Emu German Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, when he
dismissed it yesterday as ''domestic politics''. He said the EU had
plenty of time to decide whether its member states would meet the
Maastricht criteria by 1997.
''I honestly don't understand this discussion at all,'' Dr Kohl said.
''The criteria for currency stability have absolute priority above
everything else. There will be no watering down of the criteria for the
Maastricht Treaty with this Government.''
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, travels to
Luxembourg today for a speech expanding on his views on Emu. He is
expected to say that a decision on joining should be based strictly on
economic considerations, and not politics.
Mr George also believes Emu will not be in place for 1997, but agrees
with Mr Clarke that the British economy will be in shape by then to meet
the Maastricht criteria for joining. The criteria set targets for
economic factors, including exchange rates, deficits, and inflation.

GLASGOW District Council's licensing committee yesterday witnessed 52
murders and lashings of gratuitous violence -- and then went for lunch
to decide whether Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers was suitable for
release in the city's cinemas. It was, they said.
The controversial movie did not, after all, follow Driller Killer, The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Romper Stomper, and Monty Python's Life of
Brian, into the council's self-styled hall of cinematic infamy. Instead,
the committee chose to accord with the decision of the British Board of
Film Classification, which delayed the film's release before eventually
granting it an 18 certificate.
This means that Mr Stone's Glasgow fans will not now have to travel to
multiplexes in East Kilbride or Clydebank to see the film, which goes on
general release this week.
Natural Born Killers is a deeply unpleasant and often grotesque film
starring Woody Harrelson, who played the barman in Cheers, who shaves
his head and goes on a murderous rampage across America with his girl
friend. The sociopathic couple are courted by the media and the film,
according to Stone, is a satire on the celebrity status bestowed on
those who commit sensational crimes. It has already been accused of
inspiring copycat crimes both in the USA and France.
After yesterday's private screening at the MGM Cinema Complex in
Parkhead, at which nine members of the licensing committee attended,
Bailie John Moynes, the convener, said: ''The decision to view the film
was taken in response to a number of complaints we received from members
of the public.
''The film is extremely violent but we do not consider that it will
pose any harm to the people of Glasgow. We would also hope that, by
allowing the release of the film, the city will not be inundated with
pirate copies which could be viewed by young children.''
The last film which the council banned was the Australian shocker,
Romper Stomper, which was criticised for its explicit violence and
perceived Nazi sympathies. The council, however, was itself strongly
criticised in Labour Party circles. It was suggested, at the time, that
the committee had seen the film only after it was drawn to their
attention by a story-hungry journalist.
The last film which the committee chose to view before granting
permission for its release was Quentin Tarrantino's Reservoir Dogs.
William Russell writes: Oliver Stone, in Britain to promote his film,
said in London last night that the version being shown here, which has
been passed by the British Board of Film Classification with an 18
certificate, is the same as the one shown in America.
That was given an R rating by the Motion Picture Association of
America. At the censor's request, 150 cuts and trims had been made in
the film, he added. These would be restored in the video version to be
released next year.
He rejected the criticism of the film's use of violence and attacked
the way the media in America glamourised violence.
''I think there is tremendous misunderstanding about the film,'' he
added. ''When you make something that is complex and ambiguous and it is
done in a ground-breaking style, some people take it literally. Some
people think it is about the media but it is about an entire culture
head bound into hell. You cannot be responsible for the behaviour of
people who see your film.

TALKS on the transport of live animals in Europe were adjourned last
night in Brussels without a deal being struck.
Last night, Mr William Waldegrave, the Agriculture Minister, was
gloomy about the prospect of an agreement being struck today, before the
deadline ends. Talks resume this morning in a final bid to break the
deadlock.
If no deal is reached today, animal welfare will be off the EU agenda
for at least the next year, scuppered by a lack of sympathy in certain
member states.
The talks have been held amid growing public unproar at the cruelty of
cross-border trade in sheep, pigs, and cattle destined for the slaughter
houses of Europe.
After meeting other EU Farm Ministers, Mr Waldegrave said he was less
optimistic on the chances of agreeing maximum journey times for animals
in transit. ''We don't seem to be making much progress yet,'' he said.
''If we do not agree, there might be a very long delay before there
are further talks. That would not be good. I don't see any light at the
end of the tunnel yet, but let us hope for the best.''
The sticking point remains a compromise on a maximum permitted journey
time. Southern member states were last night still insisting on the
right to transport live animals for slaughter for periods much longer
than the 15-hour maximum that northern EU countries feel is a reasonable
compromise.
Among the hundreds of animal rights protesters who had turned out in
Brussels to demand action was film star Brigit Bardot who said she had
turned out ''to protest, to fight and to give homage to Jill'' -- a
reference to campaigner Jill Phipps whose death during an animal welfare
protest in Coventry has heightened pressure for Europe-wide measures.
France, in the chair for the talks, has made it clear it will not
re-table proposals, if a deal is not reached by the end of today.
Neither Spain nor Italy, who will be sharing the rotating EU presidency
for a year from June, have any interest in forcing a deal.
A compromise proposal from the Brussels Commission calls for water and
food breaks for animals in transit after a maximum of 15 hours on the
road, with further watering and feeding after a total of 22 hours, at
which time there must be a six-hour break before the journey can
continue.
It leaves open the question of a maximum journey time. Britain insists
on a 15-hour maximum for journeys within the UK and would welcome a deal
on that limit throughout the EU.
The Commission proposal also sets out compulsory licensing of hauliers
involved in the trade.
Meanwhile, the head of a firm which organises live animal exports has
resigned after threats to his family, he said yesterday.
Mr David Revell was managing director of International Traders
Ferries, the consortium of farmers and hauliers organising shipments
from Shoreham, East Sussex.
Mr Revell, 35, said that, as well as threats to his family, there had
been disagreements with other shareholders who wanted to expand the
trade.
He said: ''I was employed to set up the ferry exports. I did not
realise the amount of flak that would come out of it or that public
opinion was this strong.
''I have given up because threats to me and my family have got
completely out of hand. I have been terrified.''
Incidents have included an attack on his parents' home and threatening
letters and hostile visits by animal welfare campaigners to the farm
near Henfield, West Sussex, where he lives.
Mr Philip Lacey, a port chief resigned yesterday as governor of
Northbrook College, Worthing, Sussex, because of the row over the animal
exports.
At Brightlingsea, Essex, six people -- including a 13-year-old boy --
were arrested for alleged obstruction as animal rights protesters began
a sixth week of demonstrations against live exports.
Two hundred people staged a protest by marching in front of five lorry
loads of sheep due to be exported to Belgium.

POLICE are hunting a serial sex attacker in East Kilbride after a
32-year-old woman was abducted and raped at the weekend.
It is believed to be the third time the man has struck in dark, narrow
paths and wooded areas near the Hawkwood area of the town.
All the incidents took place in the early hours of the morning and
detectives from Strathclyde Police said yesterday there were strong
similarities between the cases.
The latest attack occurred around 2am on Saturday when a woman was
walking home. A man attacked her and forced her to walk at knifepoint
roughly a mile to a wooded area where she was raped in a 90-minute
ordeal.
Detective Inspector Stephen Heath, the officer leading the inquiry,
described it as a ''vicious and terrible attack on an innocent woman who
was making her way home''. He praised the cool thinking of the woman
which may have prevented her from being seriously injured. The woman is
married, with two chidren.
''She did very well and did all the things that she should have
done,'' he said. ''She gained the man's confidence and possibly saved
herself from serious injury, although the attack itself was bad enough,
by conning him and running away.''
The first attack happened in the same area of East Kilbride at 1am on
Saturday, January 14. A 36-year-old woman was walking home when a man
grabbed her from behind.
She screamed loudly and fought off her attacker, managing to break
free and hide, while people in nearby houses called police.
Mr Heath said it is believed that both incidents are linked to another
on Sunday, January 29, when a masked man dressed in black jumped out
from bushes in front of a 16-year-old girl and her father. He ran off
without committing any crime.
The attacker is described as between 5ft 4ins and 5ft 6ins, of medium
build, with curly brown to fair hair in a side parting. Aged around
18-20 or younger, he has a ruddy complexion, is clean shaven, and has
protruding eyes.
''We have got to keep an open mind on all three incidents but they
certainly would appear to be linked,'' said Mr Heath.
Police have stepped up patrols in the area and Mr Heath appealed for
anyone with information to come forward.
He warned local people to take ''obvious logical precautions'' at
night. ''Take a taxi, be with someone else, don't walk in dark, secluded
areas alone.''
Detectives in Glasgow say a sexual attack on a 21-year-old woman in
Drumchapel on Sunday morning may be linked to another attack on a
36-year-old woman the weekend before.
* Lothian police are searching for a man who subjected a 23-year-old
woman to a sex attack in central Edinburgh.
They want to hear from a couple who may have passed during the
incident and heard the victim screaming but were unaware of what was
happening.
The woman was on her way home on Sunday after visiting friends in the
Newington area of the city, when she was pounced on by the man.
He dragged the screaming woman into the driveway of a house in
Bruntsfield Terrace and assaulted her. He then ran off.
The woman, who managed to talk to her attacker and calm him down, was
not injured, but was badly shaken.
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said yesterday: ''This was
a horrific attack on a young woman. She managed to talk to her attacker
and calm him down. Had she not done so, we believe the attack would have
been of a much more serious nature.''
Police are seeking a man with heavy stubble and shaved head with a
small tuft of hair at the front.

THE gay serial killer and AIDS victim, Michele Lupo, refused medical
treatment including pain-killing drugs in his final months, an inquest
heard yesterday.
Only on the day he died in the hospital wing of Durham's Frankland
Jail was he given morphine to ease his pain, said prison doctor Dr
Andrew Phipps.
Lupo, 42, a former fashion consultant, was serving a life sentence for
the murders of four men in 1986.
Italian-born Lupo -- who once boasted of having had more than 4000
lovers and of often picking up as many as four men in a night -- went on
an eight-week killing spree in revenge after contracting the HIV virus.
He admitted four murders and two attempted murders and was jailed for
life in 1987.
Dr Phipps said Lupo's condition remained ''more or less static'' until
last May, after which it ''generally deteriorated''. Lupo turned down
the chance to be transferred to an outside hospital and, although given
nursing care at the prison, he refused to take any treatment.
Earlier, Mr Kenneth Morgan, who said he had known Lupo since 1978 and
used to visit him every two months, said Lupo preferred to ''stay in the
prison situation, where he knew people''.
North Durham coroner Geoffrey Burt, after issuing a certificate to
allow the funeral to go ahead, adjourned the hearing until a later date,
when a formal verdict will be given by a jury.

<HEADLINE>Rail managers angered by signal strike legacy</HEADLINE>

THE managers who helped break the four-month signalmen's strike are
threatening to withdraw their labour.
Many now have average earnings of at least #700 a year less than even
the lowest grade of signalmen who returned to work. In some cases, the
differential is as high as #3430 -- in favour of signalmen.
The managers are furious at perceived delays in Railtrack progressing
a similar pay and restructuring package that ended the damaging strike
in September.
Their frustration is such that they are gathering forces for a battle
that could see them go on strike.
However, a document in The Herald's possession reveals Railtrack's
finances are in such a mess that finding money to make up the
differentials will not be easy. It shows costs of settling the dispute
go far beyond what had been estimated.
In Scotland alone, the net increase in costs under the so-called
Signalling Restructuring Initiative is put at 8% -- although Railtrack's
London-based headquarters had advised that the rise in earnings would be
only 3.4%.
The shortfall in Railtrack Scotland's 1994-95 budget calculations for
new pay rates already stands at #344,000 -- rising to #735,000 in
1995-96.
Managers now fear their new paymasters will use these shortfalls as an
excuse to destroy the differentials for good.
A restructuring package similar to that won by the 4600 signalmen was
said to be ''imminent'' in October but one manager said yesterday: ''We
have been told little since, either formally or informally. Our
frustration is growing by the day.''
He added: ''We lost the right to collective bargaining on transferring
from British Rail to Railtrack last April and, so far, our complaints
have been made as individuals.
''But united action is now under way, and we are hoping that the
Transport Salaried Staffs' Association will take up our case. I believe
that if a ballot was taken tomorrow, it would be in favour of a
strike.''
However, it is acknowledged little sympathy could be expected from the
4600 signal workers.
A strike by managers' would not bring trains to a halt but one of
Scotland's 100 managers insisted: ''There would be a real question mark
over rail safety because of our role in the process.''
Industrial action could also damage the railways' privatisation
timetable.
The effect of signal workers' restructuring has emerged at 10.73%,
including the 2.5% annual wage award, according to the Railtrack
Scotland document.
Average earnings for some signalmen are now almost #25,000, with
increases across the grades ranging from 2.6% to 17.5% and going up by
anything between #408 and #2578 a year.
A Railtrack spokesman declined to comment on the document or its
declaration that a #735,000 shortfall in next year's budget is forecast.
Signal workers and supervisors are due to begin another round of wage
negotiations in April.

<HEADLINE>Woman tells court she was blindfolded by three men and forced to have intercourse. Rape trial told how TV actor 'bound victim'</HEADLINE>

A WOMAN broke down in tears yesterday as she told a jury how TV star
Craig Charles bound and blindfolded her before she was subjected to a
gang rape.
She said the 30-year-old comedy actor had repeatedly told her during
her lengthy ordeal to ''talk dirty''.
The 38-year-old woman told Southwark Crown Court that after the
intercourse stopped, she was indecently assaulted.
''It shocked me and I just screamed,'' she sobbed. She also told how
Charles stood beside her as he and his two friends masturbated.
The court has heard that the woman, who cannot be named for legal
reasons, was then forced to have oral sex with Mr Charles -- a
Liverpool-born TV personality who stars in the BBC2 comedy series Red
Dwarf -- and one of the other men.
The prosecution has also claimed she had cocaine inserted into her
vagina and was also subjected to further indecency with an olive oil
bottle and a pen.
The jury has been told that when Mr Charles was arrested he protested
his innocence and said the allegations were ''groundless''.
Mr Jeremy Carter-Manning, QC, prosecuting, said: ''He was saying he
had seen the woman at his flat but that no sex had taken place.''
Company director John Peploe, who is also in the dock, told officers
the woman had not been raped.
Mr Charles, of Tyers Street, Kennington, south London, and Peploe, 36,
of Keswick House, Crawford Road, Camberwell, south London, both deny a
joint charge of rape and four joint counts of indecent assault last July
8.
The alleged victim told the jury of four women and eight men that her
ordeal began soon after Mr Charles, who was an acquaintance of hers,
called round at her two-bedroom flat in Clapham, south London, at about
6am.
Mr Charles, dressed in a blue blazer and light-coloured trousers,
listened from the dock as she described how she let them in and then
returned to her bedroom.
''I was still half asleep . . . I felt I was not presentable at that
stage,'' she said.
The woman said she presumed the men would go into her living-room but
instead they had followed her. Peploe was introduced to her as Jack and
the other man as Roger.
After tidying herself up, she went with the men into her living-room
and offered them tea.
She claimed Mr Charles followed her into the kitchen and told her he
had brought his friends around so they could have sex with her.
''I looked him straight in the eyes and I said: 'No'.''
She said the actor explained it would not be necessary for her to make
love with all of them, only Roger, who was an ''important'' man who
brought him work. She refused but after returning to her living-room, Mr
Charles returned to the topic of sex.
''I was so embarrassed I went into my bedroom,'' she told the jury.
After calming down, she returned to the other room where, she said,
she saw Mr Charles ''snuff'' cocaine and give some to his friends.
She claimed Mr Charles again returned to the topic of sex, despite her
attempts to change the topic. He also tried to get her to read a ''dirty
magazine''. She again sought refuge in her bedroom but the three men
followed her.
She alleged first Mr Charles and then Mr Peploe started rubbing the
inside of her legs. ''Craig was saying how beautiful my skin was,'' she
said.
A few minutes later, Mr Charles, who she said had taken more cocaine,
began pulling some of her clothes from the wardrobe.
He then returned to where she was sitting on the bed, prevented her
from getting up when she noticed the other two were masturbating, and
then used a white stocking of hers to tie her hands behind her back.
She said Mr Peploe had helped him.
''I kept saying 'No' and I was crying.''
The woman told the court her knee-length ski-type trousers and
knickers were then removed.
She sobbed as she told how someone, she presumed it was Mr Peploe, had
intercourse with her and how she was indecently assaulted.
Mr Charles, who she said had taken his trousers off, removed her
blindfold, leaned her against the wall, and began to poke fun at her.
She claimed he then took her into the other bedroom, helped her to sit
on the floor, and re-tied her hands in front of her.
She alleged all three men then stood around her masturbating.
The court has heard how the man identified as Roger has not been
traced.
The woman told a neighbour that Mr Charles and two other men she did
not know had raped her. Police and an ambulance were called and a woman
police officer took the woman to a special examination suite in
Wimbledon.
However, it was not until the following day that she was examined by a
doctor.
''By then she had washed all over with a flannel because she felt
dirty,'' said Mr Carter-Manning.
He said the woman recounted the previous day's events to the doctor,
who concluded that marks on her body were fresh and were likely to have
been caused in the manner she described.
Because of the time-scale the doctor's ability to make accurate
findings was ''bound to be limited''.
Mr Carter-Manning said: ''She said there was a certain tenderness in
the vagina but nothing she found could confirm intercourse within the
previous few hours -- there was no semen in the vagina, for example.''
The trial was adjourned until today, when the woman will continue her
evidence.

ROBERT Black showed no emotion yesterday as three judges at the High
Court in London refused him leave to appeal against his conviction for
the murder and abduction of young girls.
Black will be returned to Wakefield high-security prison to continue
10 life sentences, with the recommendation that he serves at least 35
years.
Now his appeal has been lost, several police forces at home and abroad
are anxious to interview him over other child disappearances and
suspected murders. Devon and Cornwall police, still investigating the
abduction of Genette Tate, are top of the list.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary want to speak to Black about the
disappearances of two children -- and the Garda in the Republic of
Ireland about one more. Police in Germany and other forces on the
Continent are also said to be anxious to interview Black.
In all, a minimum of 10 police forces think he may be of assistance in
unsolved cases. They met in Newcastle in December. By all accounts,
Black will be unwilling to co-operate in any investigation.
During a day-long appeal, counsel claimed that Black, 48, had been
denied a fair trial in a case that was in danger of being drowned in
prejudice.
However, the three judges had retired for only 17 minutes before Lord
Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice of England, announced: ''This appeal will
be dismissed.'' The reasons, he said, would be given on Thursday.
Throughout the hearing, Black remained expressionless. Guarded by
three prison officers, the paedophile was dressed in the same wrinkled
blue suit, blue shirt, and dark tie he wore throughout his five-week
trial at Newcastle Crown Court last year.
Those who saw him last May said he had put on a considerable amount of
weight.
Black's deep-set eyes were fixed on counsel as they developed
arguments. Occasionally he glowered towards the press benches. He turned
to glare at the judges each time they left court. For his part, Lord
Taylor looked long and hard in Black's direction as the judges left to
consider their decisions.
From his lack of expression, the killer of Susan Maxwell, 11, Caroline
Hogg, 5, Sarah Harper, 10, and kidnapper of Terasa Thornhill, 15, was
not in the least surprised by the judges' decisions.
Mr Ronald Thwaites, QC, for Black, had argued that a pre-trial
decision by Mr Justice Macpherson of Cluny was wrong in law. The judge
had ruled that Black's Scottish conviction in 1990 for the abduction and
sexual assault of a six-year-old girl at Stow in the Borders could be
revealed to the Newcastle jury on ''similar fact'' grounds.
Black had been caught red-handed abducting that child and had admitted
the offence in a Scottish court. The decision by the judge to allow this
information to go before the Newcastle jury, trying Black for the murder
of three girls, formed the centrepiece of the prosecution case.
That decision was wrong in law, Mr Thwaites argued yesterday. While
there might have been a common signature, there were significant
differences in the crimes which were not taken into account. Mr Thwaites
also argued that the judge had been prejudiced in his summing up.
He agreed with Mr John Milford, QC, who had prosecuted at Newcastle,
that the judge had pared down his summing up to the minimum and assisted
in making the case more simple for the jury. That, he argued, was all
right if the paring down took place ''on our side''.
Mr Thwaites insisted that the trial judge had presented fully the
prosecution case but had left out the counter arguments put forward by
the defence. The judge was also wrong to admit evidence of pornographic
photographs that had been found in Black's London digs, counsel
declared.
The appeal judges -- Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, Mr Justice
Ognall, and Mrs Justice Steele -- will deliver their judgment in full on
Thursday.

THE Tory charged with defending Perth and Kinross in the forthcoming
by-election yesterday rebuffed suggestions that he was a ''white
settler'' candidate out of touch with constituents.
Mr John Godfrey, a London banker with roots in Lochaber, once came
close to representing Britain as a downhill skier until he mangled limbs
in a crash. He then broke his back while horse-riding but managed to
recover. He may discover, however, that representing a Government in a
mid-term trough is a more dangerous sport than anything he has taken
part in to date.
He insisted yesterday that his upbringing in Inverness-shire made him
entirely aware of the issues in areas such as Perthshire, where people
would understand the factors which had forced him to head south to
pursue his career in merchant banking.
His predecessor, Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, will be interred at the crypt
on his estate at Fordell Castle after his funeral there tomorrow.
Many observers share the view of Sir Nicholas that Mr Godfrey, 31, has
''not a chance'' of winning the by-election.
But he has shown commendable dignity and restraint in the face of some
of the harsher comments about him since his adoption last year.
Sir Nicholas had announced that one of the reasons he was planning to
bow out from Wesminster was the preponderance of grey party ''clones''.
Before his death at the weekend he made clear that he considered Mr
Godfrey to be just such a political careerist and called him a white
settler who knew nothing about Perthshire and little about Scotland.
However, the new candidate hit back yesterday, pointing to his
upbringing at Spean Bridge; his education at Kilmonivaig primary
followed by Lochaber High School. In searching for a job after
university he was forced to follow Lord Tebbit's advice and get on his
bike.
''Everything I have wanted to do in politics has involved trying to
get back to Scotland, because that is what I care about,'' he said. ''I
wouldn't be interested in looking after constituents in Woking because
that wouldn't excite me, whereas the idea of somewhere similar to the
area in which I grew up, and where I understand the problems . . . that
does excite me.
''The thing that irritates me about being dubbed a London banker is
that it's a positive commitment on my part to try to come home, a
positive choice. I desperately want to come back and be involved in
Scottish political life.
''I have met many people in Perth and Kinross who say they had to work
in Dubai or England or wherever. It doesn't mean your commitment to your
home area is any less. It's the easiest thing in the world to become a
Piccadilly Highlander attending Scotland matches at Twickenham. I
actually want to come home.''
His earliest years were spent in Austria, where his mother, a doctor,
was studying bone fractures. His father had retired through ill health
when the family returned to Britain and his mother, Dr Joan Godfrey,
became public health officer for Lochaber district. The young John
Godfrey was three. He stayed at Spean Bridge until he left for Oxford.
His intention had been to continue his studies at Edinburgh and join
the Bar, but he was unwilling to finance this by borrowing from his
family and looked for a job instead. With no openings in Edinburgh, he
joined Daiwa Europe Ltd in London, part of a Japanese stockbroking firm,
where he still works.
This week he will move with his wife Charlotte, a chartered accountant
from Wales he met at university, and three-year-old son Thomas, from
London to their new home near Crieff.
He became a Conservative at Lochaber High, where he jousted in debates
with an older boy, Charles Kennedy, now the Liberal Democrat MP. At
Oxford he was president of the Conservative Association.
He later became an adviser to junior Home Office Minister John Patten
and his views reached the ears of Douglas Hurd. He spent this time
pushing the constitutional question; getting Ministers to tackle the
danger to the Union as an issue in speeches.
Might this have led eventually to John Major's decision to put the
constitution at the top of the agenda? ''I would hope so. Plenty of us
have been nudging away at it, but perhaps I was excessively tedious on
the subject.''
He certainly believes the Union will dominate the by-election, which
will probably take place on April 6. After previous campaigns at Glasgow
Maryhill in 1992 and in the European elections in Strathclyde West last
year, he will be hoping it will be third time lucky.

LEADING Scottish judge Lord McCluskey last night criticised
''overpaid'' lawyers ''doing poor quality work'' and called for a royal
commission on crime and punishment to overhaul Scotland's creaking legal
system.
Lord McCluskey told an audience of lawyers, law lecturers, and
students at Dundee University that he believed that ''most lawyers are
being overpaid'', and that judges constantly witness ''poor quality
lawyers doing poor quality work.''
Despite this, lawyers fees, he pointed out, could ''dwarf'' the wages
of nurses and teachers.
The former Solicitor-General added that ''lawyers are not popular''
and advised: ''Lawyers could do themselves a power of good by
discovering ways of reducing costs and speeding up litigation.''
In a wide-ranging talk on the judge in society, he called for judges
to become interventionist to speed up lengthy civil litigation. He
complained that, too often, judges and their experience were
''sidelined'' in civil cases, most of which were resolved on the eve of
trial.
Lord McCluskey stressed: ''I want to see the interventionist judge
going right in at the very beginning to knock heads together.''
Earlier, he challenged the traditional view of the lofty and remote
judge and urged: ''On the whole, it is preferable that the judiciary
should come down from chill and distant heights.''
It was important to contest the view which regarded judges as
''doddering dimwits who did not know the difference between Madonna and
Cantona''.
The elective silence of judges, he argued, ''can too readily become an
excuse for turning a blind eye, or a lazy eye, to faults and follies
that ought to be brought out into the open''.
Judges, he said, should not be deterred from entering the political
arena, where they could bring their experience and knowledge to bear on
judicial matters which had become ''political''.

MOTORIST Alan Blaelock told yesterday how a sixth sense made him turn
on his car headlamps for a journey of only 20 feet.
If he hadn't, a court heard yesterday, Mr Blaelock, 30, would have run
over the body of an unconscious man in the gutter.
Mr Blaelock, an ice cream salesman, of Haliburton Road, Easterhouse,
Glasgow, told the High Court in Glasgow yesterday that, after hearing a
fight outside his home, he decided to check his car and move it closer
to his windows.
He added: ''I wouldn't normally have turned on my headlamps, but
something made me do it.
''They picked out this guy lying in the gutter. Otherwise I would have
run over him.''
On trial is 19-year-old Brian Connor, of Camp Road, Garrowhill,
Glasgow, who denies culpable homicide.
It is alleged that on December 4, 1993, at Haliburton Road,
Easterhouse, he assaulted Mr Steven Morris, of Stepford Road, butted him
on the head, knocked him down and kicked him on the head whereby he was
so severely injured that he died 14 days later in Glasgow Royal
Infirmary.
Mr Connor has lodged a special defence claiming another man attacked
Mr Morris.
The court heard that Mr Morris got weaker and weaker in hospital until
he died.
Dr David Doyle, who specialises in brain pathology, said Mr Morris had
an injury to tiny nerves in his brain resulting from a fall, a push, or
a car accident.
The trial continues.

which ran out of cash last year five months after its official opening,
has been secured by the investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government.
After months of complex and difficult negotiations with HCI's
receivers, the Abu Dhabi Investment Company has finally acquired the
business of the former Health Care International, together with some
fixtures and fittings for an undisclosed sum.
ADIC is putting #20m of equity into a new vehicle, Medical Investments
Group, to make the acquisition. The ''lion's share'' of that capital
will be used to fund the purchase and the ongoing development of the
business, now to be known as HCI Medical Centre.
The new owner reiterated yesterday that its main aim is to turn the
complex into an international centre of medical excellence. But it also
confirmed that it would continue to accept patients referred to
Clydebank by NHS trusts.
In a statement, ADIC said it is ''convinced of the long-term
feasibility of the majority of the hospital's patients coming from
overseas''. HCI's new chairman, Hareb Al Darmaki, the chairman of ADIC,
added: ''HCI is about delivering high- quality health care at affordable
cost.''
There is no guarantee that the Abu Dhabi connection will ensure a
baseload flow of patients from the Gulf emirates. ''ADIC is an
investment company. It does not have patients we can channel here,''
said Mr Colin Edwards, the head of the the projects department at ADIC.
''But we believe the facilities and staff at Clydebank are of such a
quality that they will justify our involvement in the venture.''
The new owners are not purchasing the state-of-the-art riverside
hospital and hotel. They will lease the premises from the receivers,
Murdoch McKillop and John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, acting on behalf of
the consortium of creditor banks. ADIC has an option to buy the complex
outright in due course.
Deals have also been done with all the principal leasing companies
with medical equipment at the Clydebank complex, to transfer these
undertakings to the new owners.
Since January 3, when ADIC was named as preferred bidder for HCI, the
Abu Dhabis have contributed a ''seven figure sum'' to the receivers to
keep the hospital complex trading and the bulk of its staff in jobs.
Current patient numbers are described as small by Dr Larry Hollier,
HCI's director of clinical affairs.
Both he and ADIC's spokesman Mr Edwards insisted that was inevitable,
given the uncertainty surrounding receivership. But Mr Edwards predicted
that the new business would break even, in cash flow terms, within two
years. The workforce, currently 350, could reach between 600 and 800 in
two years' time, he added. The original mature target, 1800 jobs, could
still be achieved ''in the medium term''.
The Scottish Office has already made it clear that, should such job
targets be met, the outstanding offer of regional selective assistance
to the old HCI, some #4.1m, will be available to the new owners.
The drive to find the patient numbers needed to make the complex
succeed falls to Dr Raphael Levey, one of the two Boston physicians who
originally conceived the venture.
He is in charge of business development in HCI Mark Two. ''The past is
prologue,'' he said yesterday.''

HOSPITAL trusts were allocated enough money to increase nurses' pay by
more than the rate of inflation this year but it will not necessarily
all be spent, their employers' organisation said yesterday.
Their admission, coupled with Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley's
assurance that ''the money is there'' to fund an overall 3% rise,
fuelled nurses' demands for a national pay award.
With only 1% on offer nationally from the Government, nursing unions
demanded to know why they were being forced to haggle individually with
Britain's 500 NHS trusts over the other 2%.
However, Mrs Bottomley warned they could lose their pay review body if
they resorted to industrial action to try to force the Government to
implement the body's recommendation in full nationally. This was her
thinly-veiled threat when she insisted that nurses had nothing to fear
from the two-part pay deal which the Government wants.
''I have already spoken to the health authorities, the purchasers, to
make sure that they make accommodations for fair and affordable
remuneration for staff. The money is there in the system and that is no
different to last year,'' she said.
Mrs Margaret Pullin, a Scottish officer of the Royal College of
Nursing, said: ''It is an insult to expect nurses to sit down and
negotiate a paltry 2%. If the money is in the system, they should just
give us the 3%. It is such a small amount that for nurses working
themselves to death it is just the last straw.
''I don't doubt that the money is there, as Mrs Bottomley says. But,
of the 500 trusts throughout the UK, only 11 have local pay mechanisms
in place. Most of them don't want this either.
''In 37 years in the profession, I have never seen nurses so angry.''
Mrs Pullin said the RCN could look again at the no-strike clause in
its constitution, but all it would really have to do is stop working
unpaid overtime.
''We don't have to say 'Everybody out', they just need to start being
clock-watchers. The trusts don't want those either: what is it going to
do for the hospitals in difficult areas to have nurses travelling about
the country in pursuit of the highest pay?''
Despite this last concern, Mrs Bottomley said the Government was
determined to press ahead with introducing local pay to help individual
health trusts facing staff shortages to set more attractive salaries.
She said on BBC Radio 4's The World at One that she believed nurses
were ''a long way'' from taking industrial action and she hoped it would
not happen.
Mrs Bottomley hinted strongly that strike action could threaten the
pay review body, set up in 1982 specifically to take Britain's 500,000
nurses out of the industrial action arena.
A spokesman for one health union, Unison, retorted that it was
Government interference with the once-independent review body which led
to the present confused and insulting award. The Prime Minister should
tell nurses and other health professionals that they would get the 3%
rather than allow his Health Secretary to hold a gun to their heads, he
added.
Unison health leaders are expected today to endorse immediate moves to
prepare for an industrial action ballot of their 240,000 nurse members.
They and the RCN are seeking a joint meeting with the Prime Minister at
which to press their case for the full 3% to be paid nationally.
Ms Christine Hancock, general secretary of the RCN, warned Mr Major in
a letter last night: ''Nurses feel hurt, demoralised -- even insulted --
by receiving a 1% pay award when other groups were offered more.
''They have received no firm reassurances that the NHS is able to fund
a 3% rise without putting patients at risk.
''At the same time, they have read about money being made available to
award chief executives up to 19% in some cases, taking their salaries to
12 times that of a staff nurse.''

<HEADLINE>Countdown to a deal with Dublin.  Ulster parties' vital talks with Hume could pave way to final breakthrough</HEADLINE>

BY tomorrow night the Prime Minister will know if he has pulled off a
historic breakthrough on the future of Northern Ireland, or created a
disaster.
Last night, he would have been encouraged by a private meeting which
took place at Westminster: it involved the three key protagonists, with
Ulster Unionists sitting down with Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly
Roman Catholic SDLP, and indicated they could be prepared to take the
peace process forward.
There appeared two vital areas of agreement: all the Unionists seem to
be at last convinced no changes will be made in Northern Ireland without
the consent of the political parties and the people; and the meeting
apparently resolved the delicate issue of joint cross-border
authorities.
There is now a busy timetable for peace. Today Mr Major in London is
summoning his Cabinet to agree the next stage of the joint UK-Irish
initiative. In Dublin, the Irish Cabinet meets to do the same.
Mr Major and Irish Premier John Bruton are scheduled to meet in
Belfast tomorrow for a formal signing ceremony.
The Prime Minister tomorrow will also be making a statement to the
Commons. The way he delivers it could be crucial.
Yesterday there was a significant change in the mood of the Northern
Ireland constitutional parties. The long meeting involving Mr Hume and
the Ulster Unionists' leaders, Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian
Paisley -- all of whom know the details of the UK-Irish joint framework
document to be published tomorrow -- was optimistic.
They issued what they called an ''immediate release'' to the press,
confirming a meeting which was described as a ''constructive
discussion'' on which they will be reporting back to their respective
parties. They added in the statement signed by the three of them that
they ''firmly resolved that no further statement will be made''.
Goverment Ministers took that as the most encouraging sign that the
parties may be prepared to make a deal to sit down together and thrash
out their problems in a positive way. Sinn Fein leaders hold a
conference this weekend which will have before it the full details of
how the British and Irish Governments suggest a platform for
negotiations on a long term solution.
Yesterday's Westminster meeting indicates that, despite the position
taking by the Ulster Unionists over the last three weeks, there is a
chance of progress.
The Prime Minister is scheduled for another one-to-one meeting with Mr
Paisley this afternoon at the Commons. It will be their first encounter
since they met last autumn at No 10, and Mr Major quit the Cabinet room
because of Mr Paisley's rantings.
Despite yesterday's meeting, Mr Paisley, DUP leader, still sounded the
most belligerent. ''I think the people of Northern Ireland will have
more suprises when the document is published. They will see it is even
worse than it was originally envisaged.'' He claimed ''a total and
absolute surrender to the nationalist agenda''.
Mr Molyneaux, leader of the UUP, will today present his alternative to
the joint framework document, but all the Unionists, vital to Mr Major's
depleted Commons majority, seem to be at last convinced there will be no
changes without the consent of the political parties and the people.
It appeared last night that the Unionists and Mr Hume may have agreed
that they do not want a situation to evolve in which the British and
Irish Governments can appeal over the heads of the Province's
politicians directly to the people in order that the precious ceasefire,
now in its fifth month, can be maintained.
Today the Cabinet is expected to endorse formally what could turn out
to be a much needed triumph for the beleaguered Prime Minister.
In the joint document, there is a possible timescale for Dublin
renouncing its constitutional claim to the territory of Northern Ireland
and an amendment to the 1920 Government of Ireland Act which enshrines
UK sovereignty over the Province. Such developments would await
referendums in the Republic and Northern Ireland.
On the delicate issue of joint cross-border authorities, the three
party leaders seem prepared to put this to one side, agreeing how to
deal with economic matters like tourism and fisheries. One problem seems
to have been resolved.
But there will be many more, and the British and Irish Governments,
aware of this, were re-emphasising last night that their document can be
changed to suit the Northern Ireland parties, including Sinn Fein, in
the search for consent.
If Mr Major can pull off a breakthrough that satisfies, even in the
short term, the Northern Ireland parties, it could transform the whole
mood in the Tory Party, which has continuously questioned his judgment
and ability.
* The Irish Fianna Fail opposition party leader, Mr Bertie Ahern, last
night demanded the release of two Sinn Fein members of the Dublin
Government's National Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, arrested
earlier in Londonderry. He called the arrests ''a provocative and
grossly irresponsible action by the British authorities just two days in
advance of the publication of the framework document''.
Seven people in all were arrested in an RUC operation, and scuffles
broke out between an angry mob and police in Londonderry after a search
of Sinn Fein's headquarters in the city.

<HEADLINE>MP complains after private referrals</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

AYRSHIRE Labour MP Brian Donohoe has complained about Ayrshire and
Arran Health Board opting to send 23 patients to a private hospital in
Glasgow for cardiac surgery, at an estimated cost of #200,000.
The Cunninghame South MP claimed he had been told by the health board
only five months ago that there was little need to opt for private
contracts.
''I think major questions now have to be asked about the management of
the board which has led to local patients being forced into receiving
treatment in the private sector when five months ago there was little
need to contract outside the NHS,'' he said.
However, Ayrshire and Arran Health Board's general manager, Mr Jim
Eckford, said yesterday that the MP had failed to understand the
information he had been given. Cardiac surgery was not available
locally.
''We first tried the two NHS hospitals in Glasgow providing cardiac
surgery services, and they are assisting up to the limit of their
capacity. We had, however, a need for more patients to be treated . . .
hence the NHS contract with Ross Hall Hospital,'' he said.
''Mr Donohoe may not wish to see the use of the private sector, but
that would deny these NHS patients their much needed earlier treatment
-- a situation Ayrshire and Arran Health Board cannot, and will not,
accept. The needs of patients must always come first.''
