THE BBC moved swiftly yesterday to rebut newspaper reports on the contents of
the Panorama interview with the Princess of Wales.
It said comments carried by the Sunday Telegraph and widely used by other
newspapers were ``not in the programme at all'', and dismissed other reports
allegedly from the interview as ``total speculation''.
The BBC also denied claims that its senior executives had admitted deliberately
withholding news of the interview from corporation chairman Marmaduke Hussey.
They were alleged to have been concerned that he might have passed the
information to Buckingham Palace and tried to censor the programme, according
to the Sunday Times.
All anyone outside an inner circle at the BBC knows for certain is that she
talked with ``no constraints'' about ``every stage of her life as the Princess
of Wales, including her family, her separation and her future plans''.
It has been alleged that the princess says on Panorama that she does not want a
divorce and that she denies seeking to wreck the monarchy.
The BBC said the comments could not have come from anyone who had seen the
interview recordings.
The princess reportedly dismisses a suggestion that she wants to destroy the
royal family, saying: ``Why should I wish to destroy my children's future?''
Asked directly whether she wants a divorce, the princess is quoted as replying:
``No . . . there are two children involved here.''
The BBC issued a statement yesterday saying: ``The BBC has given no indication
about the content of the programme. Stories about the content, therefore, have
to be seen as total speculation.
``As we have said before, only eight people have seen the programme, none of
them has talked about it and no-one else has been given any indication of what
is in it.''
A spokeswoman added: ``We are very confident that the eight people have kept
what they know to themselves. They are well aware of the importance of this and
they haven't talked to their wives, their children, or their dogs about the
programme.''
The Sunday Telegraph is edited by Mr Dominic Lawson, whose wife Rosa Monckton
is one of the princess's closest friends.
The newspaper's report says that ``aspects of the interview have been described
to the Sunday Telegraph by television insiders associated with the production''.
However, the BBC spokeswoman said: ``As far as the BBC is concerned, that can't
be true.''
Asked if there could be a source outside BBC circles, she
said: ``No-one has seen a copy apart from the eight people on the BBC staff.''
She added: ``Contrary to some reports, the princess hasn't seen a copy of the
interview, nor has she requested one.''
The statement also said: ``The BBC totally refutes claims that executives had
any intention of `deceiving' the chairman (Mr Hussey).
``This suggestion was based on the unsubstantiated remarks of an unnamed source
who could not have been close to the decision-making process. The number of
people aware of the programme was kept to the minimum operational requirement.
``The chairman was told before the public announcement, at the same time as the
palace, and this was consistent with the practice that the chairman and
governors have always made clear that they do not expect to take a view on
programmes before transmission.''
Mr Hussey, said by the Sunday Times to be considering ``a public rebuke'' to
BBC director-general John Birt once the interview is broadcast, is married to
Lady Susan Hussey, lady-in-waiting to the Queen.
The BBC statement quotes Mr Hussey's own statement on Saturday, in which he
said: ``The governors cannot judge a programme, or the context in which it has
been made, until after it has been shown and been seen.
``We have therefore made no statement and will make no statement until after it
has been shown, if then.''
The BBC statement also replied to suggestions that it broke the normal protocol
between the corporation and the palace, under which programmes are discussed in
advance.
``The only condition which the BBC agreed to was that the Princess of Wales
asked to be allowed to tell the palace,'' it says. ``In every other respect,
the BBC has total control, including of course, the content of the programme.
``It is clear that the Princess of Wales wanted to tell her story and it would
have been wrong to deny her that right.
``She wished to inform the palace herself before any announcement was made and
we're quite clear that we had an obligation to honour her wish, just as we
would have honoured the wishes of any other individual, provided we had control
of the content of the programme itself, which we had.''
The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh will not see Panorama tonight. They will be at
the Royal Variety Performance at London's Dominion Theatre.
Asked if they would be setting a video, Buckingham Palace has said that the
Queen ``does not watch Panorama - full stop''.
The Princess of Wales is to attend a gala evening in aid of the European
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer in Cleveland Row, right
opposite the Prince of Wales's apartment in St James's Palace.

Labour tax
gauntlet
for Tories
SHADOW Chancellor Gordon Brown yesterday signalled his determination to make
Labour the party of low taxation with a radical plan to reduce the lowest tax
band from 20p to 10p and a promise to look for more cuts.
With only a week before Chancellor Kenneth Clarke unveils a Budget expected to
contain a cut in the standard rate of tax, Mr Brown will today announce details
of his plan, designed to establish Labour as a tax-cutting party.
Rejecting accusations that the measure amounts to a costly ``gimmick'', he said
the new tax band was a long-term objective, designed to get people from welfare
to work, and a fairer alternative to the Prime Minister's promise to cut
inheritance and capital gains tax for high earners.
On the cost of his proposals, estimated at around #6000m, he said they would be
implemented when it was affordable ``under the fruits of growth'' of the Labour
Government.
Mr Major, in his annual speech to the City at the Mansion House tonight, is
expected to reassert his commitment to reducing public spending as a way of
funding tax cuts.
Tory chairman Brian Mawhinney dismissed the Labour plan as ``fantasy
economics''.
Dr Mawhinney said: ``He is asking the British people to believe that he can cut
the lower tax rate to 10p, increase in-work benefits, impose a minimum wage,
create a new make-work jobs scheme, and still keep the economy afloat and
competitive. It is a fantasy.''
Mr Brown emphasised the objective of reducing the lowest rate to between 10%
and 15% was a long-term one that would have to be phased in over a number of
years, beginning with the next Labour manifesto. However, he insisted low
taxation was now a Labour goal. ``I don't want to raise taxes, I want taxes
coming down.''
Economic analysts, however, said Mr Brown would do more for low earners by
raising personal allowances to take more people out of tax altogether.
Mr Andrew Dilnot, the economist who heads the Institute for Fiscal Studies,
claimed the plan amounted to ``a gimmick'' that would fail to help those
dependent on benefit.
``There is no question that if Gordon Brown is serious about trying to do the
best for those on low income through the tax system, he should use any money he
has got to increase the tax allowance. There is no doubt that would be more
effective in encouraging people back to work,'' he said.
``It's also the case that the changes he proposes to the social security
system, which he seeks to link into the tax changes, are completely unrelated.''
Mr Brown said the criticisms did not take into account the detail of his
proposal. He said benefit levels would be adjusted along with the lower rate of
tax to ensure low income families in receipt of family credit or housing
benefit profited from the change.
Under current rules, for each extra pound earned, families on family credit and
housing benefit lose a significant amount of allowance. Mr Brown said he would
reduce the amount of benefit, called tapers, clawed back by Government, in
parallel with the tax cut, to allow people to gain from the reduction.
Mr Brown said: ``People on benefits should not lose from the tax rate being cut
in any way and that's why you'd have to adjust the benefit tapers as well. You
wouldn't want to have a tax cut and then have a position where people on
benefit, who were in work, couldn't get any benefit from it.''
Raising personal allowances - currently #3200, the level of income above which
an earner starts to pay tax - was recommended by the Social Justice Commission
set up by Labour in 1992 under the then leader, Mr John Smith, to examine the
Welfare State.
However, Labour leader Tony Blair has let it be known he is unhappy with the
commission's recommendations. Yesterday, in a BBC interview, Mr Brown said:
``You don't expect me to accept everything that is proposed by the Social
Justice Commission.''
Her added: ``In this particular instance, I believe that what I'm proposing is
not only fair but it gives a tax cut all round.''

SECOND DIVISION
EDDIE Annand should have known better. Four times this season he has scored an
early goal at Broadwood - always in the first 12 minutes - and each time Clyde
have gone on to surrender by precisely 2-1.
It's not his fault, of course, but those of us who had seen it before could not
help but think that this was an all too familiar script.
East Stirlingshire, in the Coca-Cola Cup, was the original, followed by
re-makes involving Forfar and then Ayr United. On Saturday it was Stirling
Albion's turn, and the victory took them up to four points behind leaders, East
Fife, in the division.
Clyde's opener, it has to be said, was a gift. Ronnie McQuilter's headed
passback put keeper Mike Monaghan in trouble when John Dickson challenged, and
the ball broke clear to Annand, who hesitated before calmly picking his spot.
It was almost as though he was looking around for someone to pass to, in order
to avoid the jinx.
In 16 minutes Albion were level with a much more satisfactory goal, Steve
McCormick shooting home when no-one covered his diagonal run on to Colin
Mitchell's pass. Albion substitute Craig Taggart shot an excellent winner with
12 minutes left but, unluckily for Clyde, both Marc Falconer and Annand hit the
bar near the end.
The best win of the day came from Stenhousemuir, who inflicted a first home
defeat of the season on the leaders, East Fife.
Gareth Hutchison supplied the pass for Ian Little's opener and Miller Mathieson
headed in a Graeme Armstrong corner - a well-worn Stenhousemuir ploy - on
half-time. Adrian Sprott hit the bar twice to show that this victory by the
Warriors was no fluke.
Montrose were relieved at last to record their first win of the season, recent
re-signing Alan Kennedy scoring after 62 minutes against Forfar, who had
substitute Grant Inglis sent off in the final minute.
Despite their injury worries, Stranraer made no mistake at home to Ayr. Steve
Kerrigan opened with a header and Graham Duncan made sure of the points in 74
minutes.

IN TWO years' time blessings will crowd in on Conor Cruise O'Brien to
consecrate his arrival as a person of great age. This is what happens on 80th
birthdays, but O'Brien will reach that point in life as something of a
pretender for there is scarcely anything old about him.
Through most of his 78 years he has traversed the landscapes of centuries,
accompanied by a bright elegance and clarity of mind which seem able to
hoodwink time's treacheries. The hair may be grey but the eye is still merry,
and the face retains that rubicund glow of a clubbable man. Over the decades
three doctors suggested dutifully that O'Brien might choose to curb his
affection for red wine. With no loss of complexion, he has outlived the lot
But during this approach to the big Eight-O, O'Brien intends  to write his
autobiography. He will then celebrate the two events simultaneously with the
best kind of Dublin party - which is to say, nothing venerable but an almighty
hoot. The din might well resound from one end of the bay to the other,
beginning at Whitewater, his airy house high on that craggy promontory known as
the Hill of Howth.
Of course this mixture of ageless divilment and immense scholarship is one of
O'Brien's many distinctions. Observe him deliver a lecture to students and you
see immediately how fast his charm as well as knowledge entraps their
attention. Long before he was on any lap towards great age stature he had
excelled, as nobody else in his generation, at combining the roles of thinker,
writer, and man of action.
In all his careers - diplomat, politician, historian, polemical journalist - he
has shunned the predictable to achieve such an unusual record of moral and
physical courage his behaviour might well be classed as wayward for the English
speaking world.
But this singular intelligence also exasperates his fellows. Eavan Boland, one
of Ireland's much-acclaimed contemporary poets, has said of O'Brien: ``He has
sought no allies, entered no agreements. He is the voice of record and
perception, refusing any assistance in this making of his own view of the Irish
nation, resisting any consolation in his darkening vision of it.''
Yet while admiring the integrity, Boland questions some of its wisdom,
believing it has occasionally cut O'Brien off from the great tidal shifts
reshaping Ireland's common outlook. In other words, the darkening vision might
not be as overcast as he detects. But here we are less than one week away from
the Irish divorce referendum, and suddenly the Yes vote which seemed so set for
success only months ago is now in peril of slipping away.
Last time round the referendum on the matter was acrimoniously defeated by a
right-wing surge of fundamentalism. That was almost a decade ago, but in fact
the pace of change has hotted up so much in the past five years, the
secularisation of holy Catholic Ireland must have broken all kinds of speed
limits. The scandal of paedophiliac priests and hierarchy cover-ups have landed
a worshipped institution in deep trouble. But given that, and the revelation
that Mass attendance is down by about 60%, why should next Friday's referendum
now seem possessed by deja vu?
O'Brien settles back in his armchair and ponders the question. He replies with
one word: ``ambivalence'', but that is still no easy answer. And then he
elaborates: ``As an Irish characteristic, ambivalence comes strongly to mind.
It is born of historical conditioning and it always makes things like this
referendum difficult to gauge. But I ascribe the erosion of the Yes vote to the
influence of the Church of the Past.
``From the middle of the century the Church in Ireland was very powerful, and
many of those who felt they had grown away from its clutches have perhaps not
grown away as much as they thought. If you were taught that divorce was evil,
then it still has a bad ring. Even some of those who will vote Yes avoid using
the word and concentrate on the phrase, the right to remarry. The anti-divorce
lobby, of course, throw the word about with all the strength they can muster.''
O'Brien's own first marriage of 22 years was dissolved in the sixties around
the time of the Congo crisis when he had been the United Nations' special
representative in Katanga. Within six months his diplomatic career was in
ruins. In the British press he was vilified as the man who allowed ``all hell
to break loose''. His attempts to force the secessionist Moise Tschombe to
surrender had failed. Civil war erupted, and the UN Secretary-General, Dag
Hammerskjold, was killed in a plane crash on his way to Rhodesia, to meet
Tschombe who had been spirited away by the British.
O'Brien had been refused permission to travel with Hammerskjold and was left to
be battered by flak from all quarters. But in retrospect that was the better
fate. He is convinced the Secretary-General died because of sabotage.
Ambivalence has never tinkered much with his nature, and on Friday he will vote
for the referendum, believing that the Yeses will just carry the day. And if
not? ``Well, things will continue as now. Marriages will still break up, and
couples will live together without social stigma - that at least has changed.
And certain Unionists in the North will gain a few debating points, declaring
that it all just goes to prove what a bunch of bigots we are.''
But he doubts if that outcome would harm the actual peace process because - as
he has always argued - it is wishful thinking to believe this initiative can
ever work when those involved, even after one year's ceasefire, remain pledged
to mutually exclusive goals - the IRA silencing its bombs only so that talking
will lead to self-determination (codespeak for a united Ireland), and
withdrawal of British troops, and the Loyalist paramilitaries doing the same
only if guaranteed that the Union is sacrosanct.
``To talk of the peace process momentum is misleading. Momentum in the
direction of what? The fact remains that what pleases one private army will
displease the other. We should remember that in 1994 Loyalist gangs killed more
people than those murdered by the IRA, but still it would be surprising now if
IRA militants in the leadership were not saying: `Well, we were conned.'.''
O'Brien also fears that President Clinton's visit to Northern Ireland at the
end of the month may be in jeopardy, and not just because of America's domestic
turmoil.
``I think even now it may be unlikely he can come and be seen to pull something
out of the hat for peace because I doubt if there really is anything in that
hat at the moment. It is also possible that his security advisers will warn him
that on his return to Washington from his peace mission, the IRA may start up
again as early as the New Year.
``The other day Gerry Adams, on his way to America, announced that the peace
process had collapsed because of British intransigence. When asked if that
meant a resumption of violence, he gave a Delphic answer to the effect that
while the roots of evil remain there are traditional remedies. Such threats are
becoming more and more frequent, and, indeed, less and less veiled.''
Throughout the troubles O'Brien has chipped away at the myths which bedevilled
Irish politics for too many generations. In government, during  terrorism's
early days, he was the most prominent minister (his party was Labour) to
denounce both the official and provisional IRA in public. Speaking in his
Dublin North-East constituency in 1971 he condemned the movement as: ``A
fanatical, nationalist, foreign-hating, intolerant movement which, like earlier
movements elsewhere, emerges as fascist.'' He was         no doubt drawing on
painful Congo memories but at the     time it was a brave denunciation and it
enraged many who had
Now events have swung many of those to his side, but in Ireland a lot of people
still have intemperate feelings about the Cruiser. Curiously he scarcely hears
from angry republicans these days, but his columns in the Irish Independent and
Sunday Independent bring forth bilious fury from religious fundamentalists
whom, he believes, are nasty by nature and ``latch on to religion to legitimise
their hatred''. As for his own faith, O'Brien was baptised a Catholic, educated
a Protestant, and remains a principled agnostic, although he did lapse
temporarily in 1979 when his second wife, Maire, a practising Catholic, was
very critically ill after a car crash.
``People would stop me in the street and say they were praying for her. I
didn't pray, but on Christmas Day, when we knew for sure she was going to be
all right, I found myself joining in the thank Gods. It didn't matter a damn
whether I believed in God, or even whether I wanted to thank Him. I was just
thanking Him anyway out of sheer joy.'' But, true to his non-collaborative
spirit, he hasn't invoked the Almighty since.
Much of O'Brien's vision of his native land has been shaped by a family
background unique in the span of its politics. After early association with the
Fenians, his maternal grandfather David Sheehy, was a member of the old Irish
Party at Westminster from 1885 to 1918. Sheehy's brother, a priest, gave de
Valera his first lessons in nationalism. An uncle by marriage was murdered by a
British officer during the Easter Rising in 1916, and that same year another
uncle was killed in action as a British officer fighting on the Somme.
O'Brien's second wife's father, Sean MacEntee, took part in the Rising, and
like de Valera, was sentenced to death, but he eventually became Deputy Prime
Minister of the Republic. Such then is the unlikely pedigree of the man once
branded by the IRA as: ``Britain's official mouthpiece in Ireland and abroad''.
The jibes have never deeply worried him. Besides he can retaliate far faster
than most by employing what he calls ``the detested aggression of irony'' in
his writing. Politically one of Charles Haughey's most implacable enemies,
O'Brien called him ``the undead Taoiseach'', a gothic phrase to describe
Haughey's repeated resurrection from the grave of scandals. And of his old
sparring partner, Garret FitzGerald, he observed: ``He's about as nice as you
can be to get ahead in politics, but no nicer. There is steel under all that
pretty wool.''
Both scourge and sage, then, O'Brien is regarded by many       as our nearest
equivalent to Jonathan Swift and Edmund Burke, two Irishmen whose company he
would certainly relish. The breadth and depth of his own historical knowledge
were widely acclaimed after The Great Melody, O'Brien's thematic biography of
Burke, which was published three years ago. ``We have Dr Johnson's word for it
that Burke was a marvellous conversationalist,'' he says. ``I would have loved
to have experienced that. To have been able to listen to the two of them go at
it in a club must have been a great pleasure.
``When Johnson was ill and he was told that Burke wanted to see him, he
refused, saying: `That man causes me to pour forth all my powers. If I were to
see him in my present condition, it would kill me.'.'' O'Brien punctuates the
quotation with whoops of delighted mirth.
Next summer his book on Jefferson and the French Revolution will appear. ``But
there was a man who was so manipulative and duplicitous that the more I studied
him, the more antipathetic I became. Yet that in itself was fascinating.''
O'Brien is that rare figure of our time, the unpompous intellectual whose wit
and insight are so superbly crafted it is difficult to think of anyone who
rivals him today for powerfully eloquent and argumentative prose. But a writer
enters the public arena at his peril, and in a sense some of O'Brien's opinions
have made him an exile but one who chose not to forego the country of his birth.
Yet if as a nation Ireland has progressed towards freeing itself spiritually
and politically from the ideologues of Church and State, then it has been
O'Brien and a few like him who have urged it on its way. A true cosmopolitan
but a quintessential Irishman none the less.

I WAS astonished to read Mr Blyth's condemnation of recompense for a victim of
Mesothelioma - a condition contracted due to the blatant disregard by many
employers of the known dangers of asbestos - as the only way of making such
employers face up to their responsibilities is by financial penalty.
If anyone was debasing life they were, and in too many cases still are. I too
am sad and angry but for different reasons.
The financial penalties will be borne not by the companies involved but by
their insurance companies, many of whom, had they known the actions of their
clients, would probably have refused to insure them. Others it now seems acted
in full knowledge of the actions of their clients, and some may well have
colluded with them in their misdeeds.
I would suggest that compensation should be paid to anyone who contracts an
industrial disease including farmers lung, and that Mr Blyth may be better
arguing for compensation for all affected rather than criticising those who
receive some.
I agree that we live in a precarious existence, but for that very reason we
should not condone or collude with those who, knowingly and for profit alone,
combine to make it even more precarious.

IF horseracing is the sport of kings then dugs are the sport of the hoi polloi,
and within greyhound competitions the people throw up their own monarchy, a bit
like Dumas' King of the Beggars really. But I will tell you this: you will get
less ermine at the dog-tracks, but just as much fun for half the price.
Did I say that? Friday night at the Ashfield track cost me 10 quid, thanks to a
tip from a bookie who asked to be unnamed. I will call him Slim Sommerville.
Considering that Victory Day, a big dog with plenty of form, was likely to make
my fortune and that well-known punter Colin Scholes, who had his own dog,
Banshee Five, winning in the eighth race, also put me on to this, I should have
known better. I punted with young Davie Millar, the bookie. Another thing I
should have considered. Davie tried to put me off, fur ma ain sake like. A mutt
called Zanzibar beat my cur easy. A sadder and not wiser man. I'd lost two
races before to a dog called Record Greed. I'm not even lucky in love.
Not to worry. It was a grand night. Started at seven, Friday, cold with your
breath solid but there were tea bars and hot-food takeways around the stadium.
Also a licensed bar, for don't forget that this is the Ashfield Stadium, where
the footy chaps play, and part of the facilities even include the rather
splendid Ashfield bar and lounge where the public can mingle with the stars of
that junior football club. Ashfield was once a very wealthy club but is so no
longer though the public house, as I have mentioned in the past, puts a fair
amount into the football club, and sustains much of the team finances.
But Ashfield is also the venue for dog-racing, and, after many years lying in a
desultory desuetude, it has been revived for the dogs. Much of this is due to a
remarkable young fellow, Edgar - Eddie - Ramsay. He owned the famous Powderhall
in Edinburgh, though that is now closed due to Lothian Region which now
proposes to build houses on a site which once was the arena not just for fast
dogs but also for very fast athletes indeed. Eddie decided to take over
Ashfield instead and turn it into a focus for greyhound racing. He started the
renaissance last June and by September, Ashfield was open. It took 200 tons of
sand to sort out the track. Cables for the ill-fated underground heating had to
be dug out of the ground. Cleaning up the terracing itself was of Soviet
proportions. But it was done.
Today's Ashfield is perhaps a little basic and it is not exactly Ibrox or the
Glasgow Concert Hall. But it is tidy and clean, and you will not slip into the
mud and glaur which characterise many a football park or, indeed, the nearest
dog track to Ashfield, which is out near Possil and Milton, the accredited
National Greyhound Racing Association dog track, Shawfield.
Shawfield is a pleasant and rather raffish spot, and busy enough: I don't put
it down at all. But new Ashfield is even better, though it is not entirely
official. In fact it is, and nothing wrong with this, really a flapping track.
That is to say that while other NGRA tracks like Shawfield have their own dogs
the animals at Ashfield are privately-owned. But there is nothing wrong with
the facilities for the dogs at Ashfield. It is the top independent track in the
UK, and possesses a racing shed of more than 400 (number of dogs that is).
AT any one time the well-looked after Ashfield kennels can take 48 canines.
Dog-owners pay #3 to enter their champions and win perhaps as much as 20 quid
(though Ashfield is perhaps one of the strongest betting markets in Britain
with as much as 10 grand and more being punted on the Monday and Friday nights
when the races are on).
The dogs are well-looked after and weighed and the days of sticking pies,
drugs, whisky and such unguents down their throats to distort a result are,
well almost, over. The great thing about the dugs is that it is fair: everybody
cheats and that's the fun of it.
Ashfield has been much cleaned up and the bar itself is a model of hospitality.
In there, between races, I met a wheen of characters, every one of them with,
extraordinarily, a good word to say for the new impresario of this Possil
palace, Eddie Ramsay. Nae wonder. There are 16 of a staff getting wages and 20
overall. It keeps people in jobs.
Assistant manager Charlie Cawkwell told me that Ashfield hasn't just
revitalised greyhound racing, but has done wonders for the local area too.
``Even the fitba' club,'' he said. ``We do their grasscutting for nothing and
glad to.''
Yet it is not easy for the dog tracks. There is 4% excise duty paid on the
drawings, regardless of whatever profit is made on the dogs. In a sport in
which the participants have been, and remain, traditionally, people largely
drawn from mining communities and areas of heavy industry in the Central
Industrial Belt - those very areas where employment has been decimated or
indeed wiped out - it is hard for the exercising of meagre pleasures to be
sustained. But sustained it must be, just for the thrill of it. I lost, I like
to think, my 10 quid with grace. At least I had a tenner.

AS Leslie Deans Racing Club toasted their record-equalling fifth successive
Edinburgh to Glasgow Relay title yesterday, there arose the sobering thought
that the sponsors' product, well known for its therapeutic properties, might no
longer be necessary on mornings after to iron out rough stomach linings.
Barrs, the soft drinks manufacturers, backers of Scotland's premier road race
for the past 17 years, have pumped in more than #9000 in the past five years
alone. But with that agreement now at an end, and as yet no indication of the
option to continue being exercised, clubs expressed concern that the
65-year-old race might have been run for the last time.
If the sponsor's brew does fall flat, then Racing will have ensured at least a
share in the history of the event. With their victory yesterday over the
45!s-mile route between Fettes College and Glasgow's Crownpoint Stadium they
matched the five wins by Victoria Park from 1950-54. Their time, 3hr 49min
58sec, was not special, for though run under clear skies, a biting wind
assaulted the runners' faces every inch of the way, and no stage records were
established.
But their winning margin over Cambuslang, 4min 32sec, the widest since 1960,
franked the quality of the achievement. Shettleston, runners-up last year, were
third in 3-55-34. Greenock Glenpark marked their centenary by taking the
special medals for the most improved team when they finished tenth, nine places
better than last year.
Only three of Racing's octet - Brian Kirkwood, John Robson, and Davie Ross -
have been in all five winning teams, and these latests efforts will almost
certainly secure a new sponsorship package for Racing, making them even more of
a force. Regrettably, they may have to look outside Scotland for serious
competition.
They were never worse than second yesterday. Nineteen seconds adrift of Chris
Robison on the opening leg, they were brought right back into contention by Ken
Chapman on stage two. Club strategist Alan Robson had expected his team to be
30 seconds adrift of Shettleston at this stage. Instead, they were just two
seconds down on Kilbarchan, who enjoyed their moment of glory courtesy of
Robert Quinn.
The talented but unpredictable Frank McGowan showed a new maturity with perhaps
the finest run of his career, taking Racing decisively into the lead on the
third stage. He had the best time (24-58) for the shortest stage, on which only
one other runner broke 26 minutes. Any possibility of a counterattack was
crushed by further fastest stages from Scott Cohen and Tom Hanlon.
Cambuslang, who had been eighth after the opening leg, came back into the frame
thanks to fastest stages by Steven Wylie, Graeme Croll, and Charlie Thomson.
Wylie, remarkably, had finished within two seconds of the winner in the
Brampton-Carlisle 10-miler just 24 hours earlier.
Shettleston, the last of whose record 11 victories was in 1976, received a
severe setback yesterday morning when Billy Coyle, one of their best men, was
forced to withdraw because of family illness.
Scottish hill-running champion John Wilkinson was summoned to run the final
stage. The Border farmer, from near Oxton, had to inoculate 25 head of cattle
and feed 70-odd beasts - some two-and-a-half hours of heavy work - before
driving to Glasgow to race the final stage. So he could be forgiven when forced
to surrender the silver medal to Thomson.
Edinburgh Southern and Dundee Hawkhill were entitled to their anger over course
marshalling. Southern were already dead last when Scott Innes got lost on the
penultimate stage, but Hawkhill's Terry Reid was fourth, with a medal still an
outside possibility. His aberration at an unmarked roundabout consigned them
irretrievably to eighth. Details:

<HEADLINE>A small Tornado blows in from Japan</HEADLINE>

BASEBALL:
fans in Los Angeles are counting the days until the start of a new season and
the return of the ``Tornado'' - a diminutive Japanese player who speaks little
English and bows to his team-mates before starting a game.
The Tornado is Hideo Nomo, a pitcher with the Los Angeles Dodgers of the
National Baseball League, who is on his way to becoming a sports icon in the
City of the Angels and a national hero in his own country.
The success enjoyed by Nomo, whose corkscrew pitches mowed down National League
batters with ferocious regularity, was one of the few bright spots in an
otherwise miserable 1995 season. In many cities which have a National League or
American League team, sullen and disgruntled fans staged angry demonstrations
or have stayed away in droves to protest against the players' strike that
forced cancellation of last year's World Series - the play-offs that decide
baseball's best team - and cut short this year's season by about 20 games.
Some players have seen their sky-high incomes cut drastically and others were
traded because teams could no longer afford them. Once-thriving franchises like
the Montreal Expos, a contender for the National League championship in 1994,
are staring into the abyss of financial catastrophe. Analysts estimate that the
sport has lost hundreds of millions of dollars because of the dispute and some
American sports journalists think it may never recover.
Amid this wreckage, Nomo's performance is nothing short of a remarkable
achievement. Although he is not the first Japanese player to play in the highly
competitive world of North American baseball, he is the first to hold a regular
position in his team's lineup. He led the National League with 236 strikeouts,
had the league's second-best earned run average at 2.54. He chalked up 13
victories and only six losses and was the first Asian-born player to pitch in
an All-Star game.
``I was able to pitch in the All-Star game and we won the (National League West
Division) pennant, but the best was being able to just pitch in the majors,''
he said recently at a news conference on his return to Japan after the Dodgers
were blasted out of the play-offs by the Cincinnati Reds.
``For this year I am satisfied with that, '' added the 27-year-old Nomo, who
said he wants to ``pitch better and better'' when baseball resumes next spring.
Nomo, who signed with the Dodgers for a reported $2m fee, became a celebrity in
his own country because very few Asian players have been able to make the
breakthrough to North American baseball. In the flourishing Japanese leagues
most players are tied to their teams with near-feudal bonds that make it all
but impossible to gain free-agency status. Nomo was assisted by a shrewd
Japanese agent.
Japanese or other Asian players - baseball enjoys growing support in South
Korea, Taiwan, and Malaysia - who have tried to make the grade in America often
could not adjust to the vastly different culture and some were judged to lack
the power and stamina to last the hectic pace of a 165-game season.
Nomo was different. Several of the Dodgers' games were carried live on Japanese
television and his performances literally brought normal activity to a halt.
He could open the door to other Japanese players. There are reports in Japan
that 26-year-old Hideki Irabu, a pitcher with Chiba Lotte Marines, is getting
ready to pack his bags for America. Others may follow. In Los Angeles, Nomo has
become the toast of Tinsel Town.
Part of Nomo's success lies in the bond he has formed with Tommy Lasorda, the
Dodgers' manager. The two men are radically different.
Nomo is a slight, reserved man who speaks little English and no Spanish.
Lasorda is a loquacious Italian-American whose barrel-shaped girth is testimony
to his penchant for pasta. Some players have said Lasorda's mouth is as wide as
his belt. No-one on the team has ever heard him speak a word of Japanese yet he
is able to communicate with Nomo and offer him advice and guidance. It's all
done by grunts, sign language, and a nod and a wink. A Japanese interpreter
helps Nomo deal with journalists' questions at news conferences.
Nomo says he plans to learn English and Spanish in the off-season. His closest
friend on the team, Ismael Valdes, says the Japanese sensation shuns
Hollywood-style stardom and just wants to be a regular pitcher - but there's no
chance of that now.

SERIOUS doubts have emerged about the jobs of 350 workers at the HarperCollins
book manufacturing plant in Glasgow, almost nine weeks after it was announced
that a buyer had been found for the loss-making operation.
The Herald understands that workers will today reject a 25-30% wage cuts
proposal planned by Mr Chris Hardie, owner of the small Berwick-based company,
Martins the Printers. It proposes to buy the Bishopbriggs plant, which has lost
more than #10m in the past five years.
The workers' refusal to accept the proposal could end Martins' interest in the
plant, heralding the closure of the 175-year-old book manufacturing operation.
Mr Eddie Bell, HarperCollins' executive chairman, warned last week that it
would close, with all workers made redundant, unless a deal was concluded with
Martins by December 15.
Mr Hardie has told senior union officials that the wage cuts are necessary to
allow the takeover to proceed as part of a business plan which is backed by the
Bank of Scotland.
Martins, whose latest balance sheet shows assets of just #215,000 to January 9
last year, employs 30 people at its Berwick plant.
The Herald understands that about 80 of the Bishopbriggs workforce, including
printers and engineers, voted unanimously to reject the wage cut proposal at
meetings on Saturday.
The remainder of the workforce is likely to reject the proposal at meetings at
the plant today. All workers have been instructed by union representatives not
to sign new individual contracts of employment offered by Martins.
Mr David Martin, Scottish branch officer of the Graphical, Paper and Media
Union, said yesterday that Mr Hardie was refusing to negotiate the existing
contracts of employment, which protects workers wages and conditions under the
transfer of engagements legislation.
The GPMU will consider its next move tomorrow when union leaders from
HarperCollins report to its Glasgow headquarters.
Mr Martin added: ``We just want our legal entitlement. That is all we are
looking for.''
One worker said yesterday: ``We have not had a wage rise for the past two
years. Cuts of between 25 and 30% are simply not acceptable.''
More than 200 people applied for 75 voluntary redundancies which resulted from
the sale of stationery and diary section of manufacturing, which was announced
shortly after Martins declared its interest.
The response to the request for redundancies perhaps reflects the fears among
manufacturing workers at the plant.
Whether Mr Hardie and his financial backers will be prepared to alter their
package to take account of the workers' stance remains to be seen. He could not
be contacted for comment yesterday.

HUGH McBain seems to confuse private parts with public monies (November 13).
The Booker Prize does indeed enjoin publishers to contribute #1000 on direct
advertising for the winners and #2000 for a short-listed book.
Mr McBain says that he could afford neither figure, forgetting that if he had a
short-listed book he would be richer, and with a winner, very rich.
Pat Baker does not come from London but from the north of England but her
references to male genitalia arose not from either place but from a remarkable

A TYPICAL customer browsing through the true crime section of Murder One, the
London bookshop specialising in crime writing, will be a woman in her thirties.
She will never read crime fiction, and the book in her hand will be one of the
more gory ones, perhaps the life story of your average sadistic serial killer
or an anthology grouping the doctors who kill; the women who poison; or the men
who serial rape.
The fact that women buy them is possibly, says Murder One owner Maxim
Jakubowski, a case of ``There but for the grace of God go I.'' Beyond that,
like many in the industry, he does not pry.
Indeed, the question of understanding the fans is fast becoming irrelevant;
true crime no longer sells. Hodder Headline has only four or five new true
crime books this year, compared to around 12 in 1994, an example followed
throughout the industry.
A writer himself, Jakubowski shares the common disdain of the genre, which
currently produces some 40 new titles annually.
``There are certain notable exponents, they are viewed as being classic,'' says
Glasgow journalist and author Douglas Skelton, whose four true crime books
include Frightener, investigating the ice- cream wars, and Blood on the
Thistle, a collection of Scottish murders. ``The rest of us are seen as being
gutter by the crime fiction people. There's snobbery in everything.''
Unjust snobbery, he claims; the best crime books are pieces of investigative
journalism involving months of research, collecting all the facts available
between one set of covers, unlike the limited space allowed to newspaper
articles, seen as valid reporting.
And people respond. Warner Books, which publishes a number of the Kray
reminiscences and London gangster works currently dominating the market, often
finds the people from that world pointing out discrepancies.
Skelton agrees. ``I don't think it's necessarily people who like to bite the
heads off chickens who read these books. I am surprised at the people who have
read them. People write to you, just ordinary people, who remember a particular
case, they have maybe bought the book for one chapter.''
Skelton's books detail Scottish crimes, setting them apart from the pack. What
has cheapened the reputation of the industry, says Lorna Russell, editor of
Virgin Publishing's True Crime list, is the hundreds of gory titles imported
from America. One such was Hunting Humans, an encyclopaedia of murderers, found
in the possession of a man recently detained for attempted murder after
repeatedly stabbing an Edinburgh chambermaid.
Books in the Virgin Autumn catalogue sound gory enough; Rites of Burial details
the crimes of sex killer Robert Berdella. The blurb reads: ``When police
searched his house they found human skulls, hundreds of photographs of young
men being raped and tortured, and a partially decomposed head.''
But Russell justifies such books as Perfect Victim, the runaway bestseller -
selling ``tens of thousands'' in paperback - which started the company's true
crime list. ``It was exciting and as a good story was responsibly written. It
was about a woman who was kept in a box (the woman was held as a sex slave for
seven years in a basement in America). It was unpleasant, but the way it was
written was responsible rather than voyeuristic.''
Perfect Victim was published in 1990, when a number of publishers entered the
market. There are enduring classics of the genre, such as Killing for Company
by Brian Masters, on Dennis Nilsen, or Somebody's Husband, Somebody's Son,
Gordon Burn's retelling of the Yorkshire Ripper story.
The rush to publish also brought hundreds of badly-written, badly-researched
``scissor and paste jobs'' as Jakubowski terms them. Many were frankly dull,
padded out with breathless extracts from Victorian newspapers.
And then sales plummeted.
``Over the past couple of years the market has declined by about 50%,'' said
Alan Brooke, publishing director of Hodder Headline. ``There comes a time when
one has published almost all of the most interesting cases and there aren't a
great many more to cover.''
``I think it's reached saturation point,'' said Skelton. ``We are getting too
many books about the Krays, and then we have got OJ and Mrs West coming up.''
(Six authors are currently working on books about the Cromwell Street House of
Horrors.) ``There is an awful lot of emphasis placed on individual cases, and
everybody is saying the same thing.''
What may finally do true crime in, however, is the death of the Net Book
Agreement, which until late this summer maintained minimum net price for most
general books. Under threat are the fringe areas of publishing, traditionally
subsidised by bestsellers.
A spokeswoman for the trade magazine The Bookseller said: ``If you're being
squeezed on margins on your bestselling titles, which are the ones the
bookshops want to discount, which not only support themselves but also the less
well-selling titles, then you start to look at those and think, can I afford to
support these any more? That would apply quite possibly to specialist areas
like true crime.''
Publishers are philosophical: fashions come and go. ``A few years ago more gory
true crime would have sold, especially American,'' said Alice Wood, senior
editor at Warner Books. ``At the moment there's a certain nostalgia, people
like to read about old-style gangsters.''
But newspaper accounts of sensational trials are still avidly read, and the
most popular true crime books are those where the criminal is caught and
punished. ``I think there's still a market for the right sort of book. The
books of the Gloucester murders, for example, I think will do very well. It's a
genuinely astonishing case and deserves to be written about.''

BOWLS
SCOTLAND finished in third place in the European Indoor Team championship in
Jersey despite a good final day, where they won three of their four matches and
drew the other. England took the title on 57 points with Wales second on 53 and
Scotland third on 45.
The Scots did have the consolation of having Graham Robertson finish with a
five-out-of-five men's singles record after he beat world indoor champion Andy
Thomson 7-1, 7-2, 7-6.
England took a two-point lead into the final session but Wales lost both their
matches and a win in the women's fours let England stretch their lead.
Wales slumped in the second half of the championship. They picked up 32 points
over the opening three days but just 17 over the last four.
q HOLDERS Prestwick stretched their unbeaten run to six when they returned from
Edinburgh with a 90-48 win in their CIS Insurance Indoor League fixture on
Saturday.

YOUR correspondents Alan McCombes and Allan Green (November 17) both attack the
caution expressed by John Foster of the Communist Party of Britain about the
formation of a new left-wing party.
Arthur Scargill's discussion document calls for a founding date of May 1, 1996,
and for the new party to contest every constituency in the forthcoming General
Election.
The supporters of this proposal need to ask themselves a simple question. How
will the great mass of anti-Tory voters view what will in effect be another
split in the anti-Tory vote?
In this context there could hardly be a worse moment for a breakaway. It will
split and confuse the trade union movement and divide the left in the Labour
Party.
What happens after the election is a much more open question. It should be
remembered that Harold Wilson twice declared states of emergency, against the
dockers and seafarers, during his first period in office in the 1960s.
If Blair succeeds in taking the Labour Party even further to the right while in
government, then a basis for a realignment may be created in the context of
real events that will be understood by the mass of Labour Party voters.
However, Mr Blair may be heading more for a National Government of a Ramsay
MacDonald type than repeating Harold Wilson. If so, other solutions would be
available for reclaiming the Labour Party.
We don't know yet. Neither do the voters. This is not the time to take short
cuts.

ENJOYED reading Carol Howland's article describing her visit to Bruges and I
was interested to note that nothing seems to have changed in that charming old
town since I was there over 20 years ago.
Bruges is famous for its lace and I remember seeing young girls in traditional
Flemish costumes sitting on stools on the canal banks making lace on black
cushions covered in pins.
The speed at which their fingers wove the thread between the pins was
breathtaking. Carol Howland did not mention this enchanting olde worlde display
of local craft and I do hope that it has not been discontinued.

Rangers . . . . . 3  : Celtic . . . . . . 3
GIVEN the backdrop to this game, and the inevitable worries which surrounded it
following the latest intervention by the procurator-fiscal of Glasgow into
football matters, this was a memorable match between the Old Firm rivals.
It may not have been the best but it certainly was a contender to be among the
finest of these matches in the last decade.
Certainly, the two managers thought so.
Both Rangers' Walter Smith and Tommy Burns, of Celtic, were swift to emphasise
the good things about this premier division encounter.
Said Smith: ``After all the publicity about the bad aspects of the Scottish
game it would be nice to think that the focus would now move to the more
positive things we saw today.
``We may feel aggrieved about the goal which was disallowed in the first half
but, overall, I think that the teams would have settled for a draw.''
Burns added: ``It was a great game. We could not afford to come to Ibrox and
allow Rangers to stretch their lead at the top of the table - but I still don't
know how Andy Goram reached that effort from Pierre van Hooydonk in the second
half. That could have been the match-winner for us.''
In a clash watched by a crowd of 46,640, despite live television coverage,
these two incidents remain the major talking points.
The first was the disallowed goal while Celtic enjoyed a narrow lead after
Andreas Thom had struck with a spectacular drive after nine minutes.
Rangers had appeared to equalise through David Robertson 14 minutes afterwards
when Brian Laudrup threaded the ball through for the left back. He burst
forward into the penalty box, drove in an angled drive which Gordon Marshall
only managed to help into the net, and the Ibrox faithful began to celebrate -
until they saw the far-side linesman's flag raised.
Referee Hugh Dallas took on board that decision, the goal was chalked off and
the controversy began.
Unlike the Scottish Football Association, I am happy to take television
evidence and - after repeated showings - there is little doubt that the
linesman blundered. And he did so with some style.
It was a moment which might have turned the game, and the referee, by now, may
have seen the numerous action replays and realised that he was ill-advised to
accept his colleague's decision.
Watching television it would appear that two Celtic players - Jackie McNamara
and John Hughes - both played Robertson onside.
The second, thankfully, was more clear-cut - even without the benefit of
television - and it was down to the instincts of Goram.
After 66 minutes with the score standing at 2-2, van Hooydonk volleyed a cross
from Tosh McKinlay for goal as he reached the six-yard line.
Somehow, Goram reached the ball and turned it away, right-handed, for a corner.
It was an incredible stop, which had van Hooydonk holding his head in
disbelief, and Smith saying afterwards: ``Andy has set very high standards
since he arrived here, but that save must rank with his best.''
No Celtic man would disagree with that while every Rangers' man would endorse
it thoroughly.
It was a world-class stop in a match which proved that there are still domestic
aspects of this grand old game that the rest of the world can admire.
After the Thom goal, it was Laudrup - back to close on his best form after a
lengthy injury absence, who levelled the score before half-time with a shot
which he guided beyond Marshall after Paul Gascoigne and Alex Cleland had set
up the opening.
In the second half, it was Celtic who went in front once more when John Collins
scored from a penalty after Richard Gough had wrestled Hughes to the ground.
Immediately after that goal Ian Ferguson limped off to be replaced by Ally
McCoist and, within 11 minutes, the Scotland striker scored. Again, he did so
with his head.
Gascoigne sent over a free kick from the right and McCoist came in to send the
ball past Marshall and into goal.
After 70 minutes, the persistence of Oleg Salenko, out on the right, allowed
him to win the ball and whip it across the face of the Celtic goal where
McKinlay turned the ball past his own keeper.
At that moment victory for Rangers seemed certain . . . but Celtic were not
finished.
McKinlay recovered from that embarrassment to cross for van Hooydonk to head
Celtic's third goal just two minutes later.
There were chances for both teams after that, including a miss from Gascoigne
when he sent a shot wide from 10 yards with only three minutes remaining.
There were nine bookings in the game - Gascoigne, that will bring him his first
suspension under the SFA points' system, Gordan Petric, Laudrup, Goram and,
Cleland for Rangers and four from Celtic - van Hooydonk, Peter Grant, Paul
McStay, and Hughes.
But despite the number of bookings there were only two incidents which may come
under scrutiny from the men at Park Gardens, though neither would merit action
in normal circumstances.
The goalmouth clash between Goram and Hughes after which both were yellow
carded could have produced a more serious reaction from the referee.
And van Hooydonk's over-the-top celebrations after Celtic's third goal would
normally have brought a yellow card.
The problem there for the referee was that Dallas had already cautioned the
Dutchman and, while the player violated SFA guidelines, it should never be
considered a red card offence.
Whether the referee supervisor or the Park Gardens' mandarins agree is another
matter.
But what they should be doing is celebrating the kind of game which still makes
Scottish football worth watching.

John Carlyle has a lot to learn about Charles I when he asserts that he was
executed by Cromwell's generals ``on bogus charges, the usual hypocrisy of the
middle-aged''.
In the context of 1649 a straightforward beheading was a comparatively humane
way of ending the life of a despotic monarch who, for example, was guilty of
waging war against Parliament and who persisted in unsuccessful wars against
Spain, the Netherlands, and France.
He imprisoned people who would not lend him money to finance his activities. He
signed the Petition of Right in 1628, which was a landmark in the growth of
democracy, and consistently ignored its provisions.
He tried people in special courts. He allowed his officials to persecute
certain religious believers and, crucially, he ruled without Parliament for 11
years. Does anyone, including Mr Carlyle, who inveighs against greyheids and
wrinklies, really believe that Charles I was executed on trumped-up charges?
And why blame the middle-aged?

<HEADLINE>Probe into child suicide link Psychiatrists concerned that television images may help cause death bids</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By JANET BOYLE</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975290418</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CHILDREN who have attempted suicide are to figure in a study of childhood
depression, a leading psychiatrist said yesterday.
Dr John Pearce, Professor gf Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Nottingham
University, said depression in children had reached such worrying levels he
would head a study into attempted suicide in under-14s.
Of concern to many psychiatrists is that the suicide bids may be linked to
images of death and violence in the media. Two eight-year-olds have attempted
to hang themselves in separate incidents in Britain within the past few weeks.
A child in Glasgow used his school tie to attempt suicide on one occasion. The
other attempt occurred in Nottingham. Both children survived due to highly
specialised intensive-care treatment and are receiving psychiatric care.
``We are very concerned about the increasing number of young children
attempting to kill themselves,'' Professor Pearce said.
He believes children's awareness of hanging as a means of suicide stems from
images they see on television and videos.
One scene in the Channel 4 drama Jake's Progress shows Jake, a disturbed boy,
almost hanging himself with a clothes line after watching a Cisco Kid movie
with his father.
He tells his father he is going out to play a new game. The carefully shot
scene appears to show the boy swinging from a clothes rope before being cut
down by his screen father, Robert Lindsay.
Recent studies of children's television viewing habits have shown that children
as young as eight are watching television after the 9pm watershed.
Professor Pearce said: ``I am not at all comfortable about children witnessing
hanging scenes. Children who are seriously depressed may see hanging as a way
of solving their problems.''
Dr Les Scarth, child psychiatrist at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in
Glasgow, said: ``Extensive coverage of the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa in Nigeria
was broadcast on early evening news. Television news needs to be more careful
with the details of hanging and other forms of death, particularly when young
children are among the viewers.
``Young children don't always realise that death by hanging is permanent and
that they won't be coming back.''
The Royal College of Psychiatrists does not have statistics on the number of
suicides and attempted suicides in children.
Part of the reason is that not all child suicides are recorded accurately. Dr
Scarth said: ``Some accidental poisonings are really suicides but are not named
as such on death certificates to make it easier for parents to bear.''
Professor Pearce believes that not all child road victims are accidental. ``We
believe that some children may run in front of cars in an attempt to kill
themselves.''
Children attempt suicide for several reasons but often they are bearing the
brunt of pressures on their parents. Professor Pearce said childhood depression
was increasing because parents spent less time with their children.
``Many parents are under pressure to work long hours and spend decreasing
amounts of time with their children,'' Dr Scarth said. ``We now have the
longest working week in Europe and there are children who are at home for
considerable periods of time while both parents are out at work. Pressure also
comes from over-expectation from parents. Sadly, children as young as eight are
under pressure to over-achieve at school.''
Rising divorce and separation meant that, in practice, fewer children were in
regular contact with both parents, Professor Pearce said.
``The best advice I can give parents is to keep lines of communication open
through regular conversation with their children,'' he said. ``Do not only talk
to them when they have a problem but get into the habit of talking about what
the child is interested in.
``Talk about football, pop music, and clothes even if you are not interested in
those topics.''
Dr Scarth said: ``Be alert to distressed children and they won't need to go to
great lengths to tell us how depressed they are.''
q.A Channel 4 spokeswoman said yesterday: ``Channel 4 programmes must meet the
very rigorous broadcast standards set by the ITC and by our own internal
systems. We are satisfied that these have been applied in this instance. Alan
Bleasdale's Jake's Progress is a powerful drama series about a family in crisis
and includes strong material which we feel is justified by its context and is
reflected by its scheduling at 10pm.''
A spokeman for the BBC said: ``We are always very sensitive to the images we
show on TV news, particularly the early evening news. We have specific and
well-tried guidelines on this issue.''
A spokeswoman for ITN said: ``We are aware that children may be watching news
at various times of the day and we do structure our reports accordingly''.

BAILIE Charles McCafferty should endeavour to keep abreast of the times
(November 15).
Parliament, like local government, has had a members' register of interests for
years. Both registers were completely ineffective in making it clear to the
public how much their representatives were receiving in direct payments and in
all their associated benefits.
The Labour Party campaigned vigorously to have the parliamentary register
improved. It remains silent on taking steps dramatically to improve the local
government register on remuneration, interests, and side benefits.
Cosla claims that the post of Leader of the Council should be full-time and,
although not requiring any professional qualifications, should be paid the
equivalent of an assistant principal teacher or a professional employee, ie, in
the region of #19,000 to #21,000 per year.
Labour councillors have interpreted the regulations so that part-time
councillors in full-time employment, or others having the benefit of large
local government redundancy pensions, can earn this year #22,000 in direct
payments from a council plus an income from quangos, media appearances, etc, on
top.
They can also receive for a 1200cc car the sum of #1894 per year tax free, plus
very considerable subsistence allowances and up to 90% of their phone bills
paid - all this, not to mention the attractive jaunts to various UK and
overseas resorts, staying in first-class accommodation.
In Cumbernauld and Kilsyth the basic district council allowance at present is
#1835pa, yet I believe two councillors are receiving this year through local
government and its associated payments, in the region of #30,000.

CAR crime in Britain is twice as bad as anywhere else in Europe, figures
released yesterday show.
One car is stolen every 59 seconds in England and Wales, and 23 cars are stolen
for every thousand cars on the road, according to statistics from insurance
company Eagle Star.
Europe's second worst car crime country is France and the safest is Austria.
Thefts of and from cars cost British insurers nearly #587m last year.
Last week the AA produced a profile of the average car thief, who was shown to
be young, ill-educated, and probably from a family involved in crime.
Police said professional gangs were prepared to travel the length of Britain to
steal cars and then strip them down or sell them abroad.

In our ancestors' day a croft may have been left to two members of a family and
they each got a half, hence the address.

AN audience of 15 million people tonight is expected to watch one of the most
eagerly anticipated interviews in TV history when the Princess of Wales talks
about her failed marriage.
By 10.20pm, the nation will know her version of events following her dramatic
decision to give her first television interview since the ill-fated royal
marriage in 1981.
However, the decision to go public could return to haunt the princess, who has
in the past been at pains to protect her privacy.
Lord Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, at the weekend gave
a veiled warning that the appearance on Panorama could see the princess
sacrifice her right to privacy.
This view was backed yesterday by the wife of England rugby captain Will
Carling.
Mrs Julia Carling, who split with her husband following allegations that he had
had secret ``trysts'' with the princess, said the princess had put her life
back into the public domain by appearing in the BBC1 programme.
Speaking on Talk Radio UK, she said that although she resented the media
coverage of her marriage break-up, she agreed with Lord Wakeham's assessment of
the latest situation.
Lord Wakeham said people who went voluntarily into the public domain put
themselves beyond the protection of the PCC and ``must bear the consequences of
their actions''.
Mrs Carling said yesterday: ``I think he made a valid comment that, yes, if you
are going to go off and do all these things . . . then your life is now public
and I accept that.''
In the same interview, she told how the stress of her marriage split and the
media interest had given her health problems such as insomnia and migraines.
``It is not a game or a war and I don't want to take part in it,'' she said.
``You can't win and I don't propose to win. I can't control the media and I
don't choose to.
``I have had all sorts of letters from lots of lovely people and I would say
98% of them have been positive and supportive and I do really appreciate that -
because I have never ever been in a position like that to warrant little old
ladies sending me food parcels.''
Mrs Carling said she had not been given counselling for stress but had relied
on friends for support during a ``real bummer of a phase''.
She said many of the people who had written to her had wanted to talk about the
end of their own marriages or relationships.
``I am not the only one who has had a marriage break-up and there are going to
be hundreds more - sadly. What is alien to me is how you deal with it in the
public eye.
``I'm a strong cookie. Once I get out my own front door and as soon as you are
in front of the TV camera you have to be a bright and bubbly person.
``I don't want people to see me unhappy because it would make me crumble in the
public eye and I can't afford to do that because I want to keep my job,'' she
said.

MARTIN BASHIR, 32: The journalist who did the interview. Known for a
gently-persuasive manner. Had not worked on a royal story before and was
best-known for an investigation into the business affairs of England
international football manager Terry Venables. He has insisted that he
approached the princess during research into constitutional aspects of monarchy
- which Buckingham Palace has called ``a smokescreen''.
OLIVER HOARE: Millionaire art dealer and father-of-two, 50, a long-standing
friend of the princess. Last year his wife complained to police about a series
of silent telephone calls to their home - and, according to a leaked report,
many were traced to Kensington Palace, the princess's home.
WILL CARLING, 29: England rugby captain who in August became the latest of the
princess's friends to find himself at the centre of media attention. His wife
Julia at first said their marriage would survive, but she left her husband last
month.
JAMES GILBEY: Aged 39. First became widely known as a key source for Andrew
Morton's Diana: Her True Story. Then said to the male admirer in the so-called
``Squidgy'' tapes, alleged to record a romantic telephone conversation with the
princess. The tape was cited as proof that the Wales's marriage was on the
rocks.
MAJOR JAMES HEWITT: A dashing Life Guards officer, 37, said to have given horse
riding lessons to the princess and her two sons. The princess was reported to
have shown her appreciation by kitting him out in expensive clothes. Last year
he was derided by the media after he co-operated with a book, Princess in Love,
which used romantic novel prose to describe his alleged relationship with the
princess.
JOHN BIRT: Director-General of the BBC. One of eight corporation executives who
have seen the interview tapes. Hired as a ``troubleshooter'' from ITV in 1987.
He believes scoops are less important than analysis. His efficiency drive led
to thousands of job losses, and complaints of ``an atmosphere of fear''. He was
in New York at the weekend to receive an Emmy for ``his successful leadership
of the BBC during a testing period in its history''.
PATRICK JEPHSON, 39: The princess's private secretary. A former Royal Navy
Lieutenant Commander, he is said to have felt humiliated when he told of the
Panorama interview . It has been suggested that his services might be withdrawn
from the princess.
GEOFFREY CRAWFORD, 44: Deputy press secretary to the Queen and acts as press
secretary to the princess. He too, according to widespread speculation, could
cease to work for the princess after being kept in the dark. He has been seen
as a bridge between the princess and the palace.
MARMADUKE HUSSEY: BBC chairman. In accordance with tradition, he has not being
shown the interview in advance. The BBC has been particularly keen to stress
the fact, because his wife is Lady Susan Hussey, lady-in-waiting to the Queen,
and the royal family is not getting a preview either. Duke Hussey, 72, was a
leading newspaper industry executive for decades, taking the BBC post when he
retired from News International at 63.
CLIVE JAMES: At 55 a multi-media star and a friend of the Princess of Wales. As
long as 14 months ago it was being suggested that he was helping her plan a TV
interview to put her own side of the story after Charles made the Dimbleby
documentary.
The idea that on his not-infrequent lunches with Diana, the former chat-show
host had given her advice about a TV appearance resurfaced last week. But the
princess had decided to talk to a ``serious'' current affairs reporter rather
than a chat-show host.
CAMILLA PARKER BOWLES:
A close friend of the Prince of Wales for 25 years and the subject of his
admission - in his own TV interview with Jonathan Dimbleby - that he had
committed adultery after his marriage failed.
The mother of two, 48, was divorced from retired Brigadier Andrew Parker
Bowles, a former Silver-Stick-in-Waiting to the Queen, 10 months ago. Last
month, she and the Prince of Wales attended the same birthday party at London's
Ritz Hotel, widely seen as a move to win public acceptance of them as a couple.
LORD WAKEHAM: chairman of the Press Complaints Commission. He has defended the
Prince and Princess of Wales family's right to privacy, but warned that talking
publicly could place them beyond his protection.
The former Cabinet member, 63, wrote in the Mail on Sunday: ``Where a member of
the royal family seeks to put a matter into the public domain - through a
public interview - that too becomes a matter of national interest on which
comment and reporting are legitimate and predictable.''
NICHOLAS WITCHELL: Former BBC newsreader, 42, who speculation suggested might
have been involved with earlier discussions with the Princess of Wales about
the possibility of an interview.
After leaving the breakfast news chair 13 months ago, he was working on special
film reports for Panorama. But later he became the BBC's diplomatic
correspondent.

Raith Rovers 1, Aberdeen 0
IF IT is true that there is more to be learned in defeat, then Aberdeen can
start burning the midnight oil this week in the lead-up to the Coca-Cola Cup
final.
Preparations for the meeting with Dundee at Hampden will take on a new
intensity after Raith Rovers had inflicted a damaging blow to the Dons' morale
with this victory at Stark's Park.
These Fifers know precisely what it takes to win a trophy, having overturned
Celtic a year ago in the most dramatic fashion, and right now, there is a
feeling within their ranks that the underdog again will triumph.
Defender Ronnie Coyle maintained yesterday: ``If Aberdeen play like that at
Hampden, then Dundee must have a great chance of lifting the cup.
``They did not look too clever with their flat back four, and our pace up front
caused them problems.
``Dundee must get Neil McCann involved. If they can get the ball over their
defence and utilise the winger's speed, they can cause another upset.
``We have had hidings in the past when we tried to play Aberdeen at their own
game and gave them too much respect. This time, we closed them down, did not
allow them space to operate, played to our strengths, and they didn't fancy it.
``This was a very important victory for us and provides a very serious chance
to establish ourselves in the premier division. We know now that we are a match
for anyone at home.''
But Raith may have to secure their premier status without striker Ally Graham,
who is unhappy with his infrequent appearances. Graham's height and awkward
style posed constant problems which Aberdeen never suggested they could solve.
``We have won every game I've started this season and I deserve a place,'' said
Graham. ``I keep hearing the club is trying to bring in a new striker, but the
manager will not find anyone better than me.
``I will never be a Mark Hateley, scoring 20-odd goals each season. But I can
help develop our youngsters like Stephen Crawford, who is a real prospect, and
chip in a few goals as well. Whatever, I'm not interested in hanging around the
bench.''
A first-half penalty, when Aberdeen's central defender John Inglis sent Graham
tumbling, was converted by Danny Lennon for the match-winner to take Raith into
fifth place in the league.
Aberdeen, without the injured Eoin Jess, were uninspired, and their manager Roy
Aitken admitted his side had deserved to lose. He must hope that Jess has
recovered in time for the final.
His one consolation is that every time Aberdeen have failed to reach the
standards demanded, they have come back with a convincing performance.
q CLYDE veteran Charlie Nicholas is set to join Seria A superstars AC Milan -
but only for five days. The 33-year-old former Aberdeen and Celtic hero wants
to watch the Italians' training methods to see how top coach Fabio Capello puts
#15m hit-men Roberto Baggio and George Weah through their paces.
But Nicholas will have to wait until manager Alex Smith can release him from
his commitments with the Broadwood club. Nicholas said: ``I've always wanted to
watch AC Milan's training methods since Joe Jordan was at Celtic.
``He went over there quite a lot and I'd like to see how it all happens for
myself. However, Alex Smith needs me at Clyde, so I'll just have to wait
meantime.''

TEN years ago, 80,000 Britons went on cruises, this year the figure will be
300,000 - more than half of which are first-timers. The ships themselves have
polarised into big and flash and small and chic. At one end of the market are
the leviathan floating pina colada palaces, at the other is a shoal of ships of
shallow draft - ideal for expedition and exclusive ``off the beaten track''
voyages.
Nature's frozen wonderland is attracting an ever-increasing number of
travellers to the southern hemisphere to enjoy an Austral summer. Antarctica
might not be everyone's idea of a dream cruise, but there can be few thrills
more daunting than coming face-to-face with an iceberg, those stately,
beautiful, floating sculptures coloured in various delicate shades of blue and
green.
The reality of being in Antarctica comes home when you board a motorised zodiac
landing craft and go ashore - walking on a continent where few humans have ever
set foot.
Antarctica covers more than 5.5 million square miles. It has been likened to
the moon because of its isolation and mystery, it is certainly the highest,
coldest and windiest of any continent and an extensive ice-sheet, sometimes two
miles thick, covers its entire surface. Here you can be sure of a white
Christmas.
There is only one civilised, comfortable way to get to this final frontier and
this is where cruise ships sail into their own. Uniquely suited for cruising
from the southern-most tip of South America, the aptly-named Marco Polo has an
ice-strengthened hull and environmentally sound disposal system, yet boasts all
the graciousness and comfort of a first-class cruise ship.
On board this winter's sailings will be specialist lecturer Dr Brian Wood. A
microbiologist from Strathclyde University, he has undertaken significant
research on the fertility of the Antarctic marine environment. He has also
linked his studies of microbial life forms in Antarctica to the possibility of
finding life in other harsh environments, such as the planet Mars. While on the
White Continent recently, Dr Wood also enjoyed the distinction of being the
first person to brew beer there since the days of Scott and Amundsen.
Life in the freezer is far-removed from a Ranulph Fiennes expedition, the
comfortable 22,080-ton Marco Polo conveys just over 400 passengers. As our
nights grow longer maybe it's time to ponder close encounters with polar bears,
seals, penguins, whales, whole colonies of sea birds and an awful lot of ice.
To boldly go with the ``floe'' this winter will cost from #2995, inclusive of
air fares.
Other offerings from cruise companies to ``off the beaten track'' destinations
this winter include sails to the golden pagodas of Burma, the Spice Islands of
the Java Sea, the temples of Bali and Bangkok and even to the Red Dragon itself
- China.
Silversea Cruises' Silver Cloud will be operating 10 to 14 nights from
Singapore, Bangkok and Hong Kong between November and April. Awarded second
place in the Top Ten best Cruise Ship Awards for 1995 by Fielding's Guide to
Worldwide Cruises, Silver Cloud offers the ultimate cruising experience.
With a passenger capacity of 314 in all-suite luxury, discreet pampering is
what this all-inclusive cruising concept is about. Meals, drinks, wine
gratuities and excursions are included in the fare - and when bookings are made
at least 90 days in advance, there's 25% discount.
So if you fancy a sojourn in the South Seas, these oriental odysseys will cost
from #3142 (including discount), with Club Class air at a supplement of #299
return.

FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
ALBION Rovers keeper Marc Osborne has so incensed club manager Jimmy Crease
that the Albion official claims that Osborne will never kick another ball.
The player failed to turn up on Saturday for the match against Queen's Park and
striker Alex McEwan was asked to play in goal. The Spiders won the game 4-1.
``He is an embarrassment to me, and he makes this club look amateurish,'' said
Crease yesterday. ``I will not forgive him. He will never do this to another
club or another manager. I will make sure of that.
``I took him out of the Juniors and signed him for Berwick. And when he was
unhappy there, he came to me earlier this season and pleaded with me to help
him. We needed a keeper and I paid out #2000 for him.
``That might not sound a lot of money, but it is to a club like Albion Rovers.
But even worse, he knew he was the only keeper on our books, and yet he did not
warn me about this.
``I avoided putting in my team lines until the last minute. It was after the
game when I phoned from Hampden that I finally got him, and he told me: `I have
chucked it.' I will not tell you what I said to him.
``His father agrees with me for he had left all the messages for him and did
not know until Saturday night that Marc had not gone to the game.''
q IPSWICH veteran John Wark's hopes of a testimonial match against Rangers have
been sunk. The police have refused permission to allow Walter Smith's men to
travel south after Rangers supporters were involved in incidents before the
benefit match against Sunderland two years ago.
Wark now hopes to line up his former club, Liverpool, for his last game before
hanging up his boots. ``It's a big disappointment that Rangers couldn't make
it,'' said Wark, ``but Walter Smith tried his best.
``However, it's now just a matter of fixing a date with Liverpool, who are not
a bad second choice.''
q JOHN Brown has predicted a bright future for newly-signed Derek McInnes at
Rangers.
Brown was in charge of the Ibrox side for their 2-2 draw with Celtic in
Saturday's Premier Reserve League clash. Said Brown, who also came on as a
substitute: ``This was the first time I had seen Derek play. He is a Rangers
fan, and is desperate to do well. You could see that, especially during the
first half, when he was outstanding. It should not be too long before he is in
the first team.''
McInnes set up the opener for Steve Boyack seven minutes from the interval.
Chris Hay equalised after 63 minutes, Boyack again put Rangers in front, then
Hay replied 10 minutes from time.
Celtic coach Frank Connor said: ``We might just have had the edge, but it was a
fine, attacking game.''

IF THE world was a car dealership, then George Galloway would probably be at
the front of the forecourt, the one with the racy, some would say noisy, engine
- a bit like the Mercedes convertible he drives himself.
The car is a metaphor for Galloway. To his many critics, it's a symbol of a
flashy, sybaritic lifestyle which jars with the myriad problems of his Hillhead
constituency. To Galloway, it stands for the style, the nous, which he thinks
sets him apart from those who would bring him down.
``I drive an imaginative car which is second-hand, 10 years old, and costs less
than a Ford Sierra. The enmity about the car merely demonstrates again that I
have more imagination than some of my critics. I don't believe that that
constitutes any kind of dolce vita.''
If the car convinces him that he is one up on his enemies then this weekend has
underscored it. For the fourth time in his roller-coaster career, Gorgeous
George, the Bollinger Bolshevik, sharp-dressed and oft-tanned, has seen off a
challenge to his position. He claims he never doubted he would, but this time
it's different. This time, he says, he's had enough.
``All I say is that this has got to be the end of it. We can't go on for the
next 10 years as we have gone through the last. I had to fight for the seat in
1986, I had to fight a no-confidence move in 1987, I had to fight a
re-selection in 1990 and I had to fight another re-selection in 1995, while
fitting a couple of General Elections in between; this simply can't go on. It's
debilitating to party life, certainly debilitating to me - it's put years on me
- and how anyone can harbour a grudge that length of time, frankly, astonishes
me.
``I have tried so hard over the past five years; mending fences, soft-soaping
and trying to be nice to former adversaries, and I was led to believe, and
indeed some of them explicitly said so, that I was not to be challenged this
time . . . that kind of approach makes it fairly clear that the olive-branch
approach that I have been taking not only has not worked but has led me up the
garden path.''
In true Galloway style, he has formulated a plan, a rather showy plan, to take
the wind out of his detractors' sails.
``It can only be ended in unity of action, so our constituency has been twinned
with Stirling in the momentous task of defeating Michael Forsyth. I'm going to
pay for and organise a bus going every week to Stirling to work with our
colleagues there in the Stirling Labour Party to help defeat Michael Forsyth.
The acid test is this: everyone who gets on that bus is not only my friend but
a real friend of the Labour Party. Anyone who refuses is, as far as I'm
concerned, beyond the pale.''
They're fighting words, vintage Galloway, but he claims that he has been deeply
hurt by the ``on-going animus'' against him from what he describes as a small
section of the party as a whole but concentrated very heavily in the Kelvinside
district.
``Only a fool becomes inured to wounding criticism and personal attack, and I'm
certainly not inured to it. It's a sort of heavy-heartedness rather than anger.
You would have to know the amount of soft soap that I have applied and you
would have to know the number of times I and my closest supporters were told,
`don't worry there is no-one going to stand against you this time'. If you ask
me if I'm bitter about it, I'm very bitter about it indeed.''
He may be bitter, but he can hardly be surprised. He is, as one commentator
said, a man whose head is always above the parapet. If it wasn't twinning
Dundee with the Palestinian stronghold of Nablus, or joining Gerry Adams at a
troops-out march, it was claiming to have had ``carnal knowledge'' of women at
a charity conference in Greece, apparently publicly saluting Saddam Hussein's
``courage, strength and indefatigability'', presiding over a messy,
highly-publicised bid to buy Partick Thistle Football Club, and gracing a
tabloid's feature pages with his fiancee.
Yet despite the controversy that has clogged his career, it's difficult to get
Galloway to admit to a fatal mistake. He has been described as one of the most
gifted politicians around today, but one flawed by impetuosity.
``I am a deeply flawed person, as you are and as everyone is,'' he says,
peering through the thick curl of smoke from his fat cigar. ``Impetuous? If it
means maverick in the sense of unpredictable that's wrong, because if you had
the time to study my cuttings going back 20 years you would find clear
consistency and a clear pattern of stances on issues. I'm not unpredictable in
that sense. In fact, I'm highly predictable in that you can be sure which way I
will come out on an issue and if I come out on an issue I do it in my own
style, and that has a certain effect.
``I think I'm slightly over-emotional and I'm not a cold person; that can
sometimes lead to a sort of rush of blood to the head, and certainly causes
verbal infelicity - there's no doubt about that.
``Only an idiot has no regrets. I regret plenty and there are lots of things I
wish I hadn't done. Things I wish I hadn't said, lots of things I wish I'd said
differently, and I have no doubt that some of the things that I have said and
done wrongly... place a sort of ceiling on what I can `achieve' in terms of
attaining office.
``Am I sorry about that? Yes, of course I am, but there are compensations. I
would rather be emotional and, if you like, politically - and I stress
politically - hot-blooded than be a cold fish unmoved by things. I'd rather be
over-emotional than be a cynic. Indeed, I think cynicism is the very worst of
vices. If that's what they write on my gravestone - gifted but flawed by
impetuosity - that's not a bad achievement. My choice is `A Man of the World'.
That'll be the title of my memoirs when I write them.''
His fascination with the world beyond the parish pump was nurtured in his
intensely political childhood in Dundee - ``I was always the one who knew who
the Secretary of State for Trade was and who the Prime Minister of Uganda was''
- and he harboured dreams of becoming Labour's Foreign Secretary, a role he now
admits is lost to him.
``I'd love to be Labour Foreign Secretary, of course I would, but it doesn't
cause me any kind of simmering resentment that I'm never going to be . . . I'm
more than happy that Robin Cook is going to be a Labour Foreign Secretary and I
entertain the hope that he lets me whisper in his ear from time to time . . .
I'm more than busy enough with the things that I am doing.
``It would frustrate me if I could no longer be active and if I thought I had
no influence. I think I do have influence on events and sometimes I am able to
open people's eyes to issues.''
He claims his stock within the constituency remains high and rejects any
suggestion Hillhead gets ignored in his fascination with all things foreign.
His constituents, he believes, value an independent-minded and colourful MP.
The shape of his own political future remains a little unclear; the rebel
without an obvious role. Personally, he hopes to start a second family, and
professionally he will stay in politics until the bitter end, hoping ``to die
with my boots on politically''.
But he has made it plain he is not happy with the way his party is moving,
taking frequent swipes at New Labour, despite a professed personal regard for
Tony Blair.
``I don't believe that the programme advanced by Tony Blair is capable of
solving the crisis in this country. I think it seriously underestimates the
depth and the nature of the crisis in this society and I do not believe that
what is essentially a non-socialist programme can even begin to tackle the
problems.''
He is also confused about his role in a Scottish parliament. ``I have a real
dilemma about that, to be honest. I'm one of the longest-serving battlers for a
Scottish parliament and I desperately want to see one. Mr problem is that, of
course, foreign affairs will continue to be dealt with at Westminster and
that's my area of speciality.
``I haven't really made a final decision as to what to do about that. It's a
real problem because much as I would like to be part of this new parliament . .
. the idea of never being able to raise the international issues that concern
me would be quite difficult.''
What he also finds difficult is answering what he calls ``psychiatrist's
chair'' questions, but towards the end of the interview he finally buckles and
admits the Bollinger Bolshevik moniker doesn't bother him, but the worst insult
anyone could hurl at him is ambivalence.
``It seems to be the case that few are ambivalent about me. That's just my own
personality and character.
"I was born with it and you can no more alter that than you can alter the size
of the nose on your face . . . I certainly reject the idea that socialists
should wear a cloth cap and muffler or that there are things which are too good
for the workers.
``Why should the Devil have all the best suits and all the best cars? I smoke a
cigar ever day and I have a car that looks nice, that people would like to go
for a spin in,'' he says. ``Most people are unmoved by a Ford Sierra.''

MASASHI Ozaki, known to the golfing world as Jumbo, confirmed his liking for
the big occasion by eagling the last hole to hold off the foreign challenge and
retain the Dunlop Phoenix tournament in the rain at Miyazaki, in southern
Japan, yesterday.
The 3 at the eighteenth, a par 5 of 534 yards, gave Ozaki, the defending
champion, a three-under-par 68 and a total of 273, 11 under, one ahead of
Australia's Peter Senior, the overnight leader, and the American duo of Robert
Gamez and Brandt Jobe, who both shot 67.
``It was my destiny to win this week,'' said a relieved and delighted Ozaki,
who won #180,000 and re-established his place as Japanese No.1. ``Unlike last
year my golf game this week was not of the type to be commended, but winning
like this will strengthen my confidence. At 48 it's difficult to maintain my
position but I want to give the young players something to aim at, to upgrade
their play.'' Three adrift of Senior at the start of the round, Ozaki made no
progress as they both went out in 35, one under, but the stocky Australian
bogeyed the twelfth and sixteenth.
Up ahead, Gamez, who had two birdies and an eagle in the first four holes and
Jobe, winner of the Asian order of merit, who eagled the last, were making
their bid.
``After the sixteenth, I convinced myself I could do it again,'' Ozaki said. He
hit a ``perfect'' No.4 iron to 20 feet at the 188-yard seventeenth and was in
paroxysms of agony when the birdie putt sat on the lip. Senior ignored the
hubbub to hole a three-footer for par, to keep a share of the lead, alongside
Jobe and Gamez, who had finished on 10 under.
Ozaki mounted the eighteenth tee nine under. His drive left him with 220 yards
to go, and he launched a No.4 iron to within 30 feet of the hole.
Senior was over the green with his No.3 wood and when he left his chip 20 feet
short, Ozaki stepped up to his ball full of confidence. ``I will hole this
putt,'' he told himself, and he did. The crowd went wild, calmed itself and
then, went wild again when Senior's putt to tie stopped an inch short.
It was Ozaki's fourth win of the season, taking his winnings in Japan to almost
#1m. Leading scores (Japanese unless stated):
273 - M Ozaki 65, 71, 69, 68.
274 - B Jobe (USA) 69, 67, 71, 67; R Gamez (USA) 66, 69, 72, 67; P Senior

ENGLAND'S Laura Davies carded a 68 in the final round of the Australian Masters
at Royal Pines on the Gold Coast to finish in joint third place, nine behind
winner Annika Sorenstam, of Sweden.
Alison Nicholas, who had headed the English challenge for much of the
tournament, could manage only a 72 to close a further three shots down the
field in joint sixth place.
Sorenstam carded a cautious four-under-par 69 but still won the title by a
record margin of eight strokes. She returned a 72-hole total of 270 to finish
22 under par - also a tournament record. The Swede bettered the previous record
of 20-under-par set by Davies last year. She missed out by four shots on
equalling the world record of 25 under par set by Davies in winning this year's
Irish Open.
The win was the sixth of the year for US Open champion Sorenstam, the leading
money-winner on both the US LPGA and European tours, and moved her closer to
overhauling Davies as the world's top-ranked player.
Two-time champion Jane Geddes recorded her fifth top-three finish in the event,
carding a final-round 70 to be second on 278.
Liselotte Neumann, Sorenstam's compatriot and winner of last week's Australian
Open, finished level with Davies, who had been aiming for her third straight
victory at Royal Pines. Leading scores (Australian unless stated):
270 - A Sorenstam (Sweden) 66, 68, 67, 69.
278 - J Geddes (USA) 70, 73, 65, 70.
279 - L Davies (England) 72, 70, 69, 68; L Neumann (Sweden) 66, 72, 69, 72.

Hopkins (Wales) 70, 74, 74, 75. 299 - S Strudwick (England) 78, 72, 74, 75.
q ENGLISH duo Ben Jackson and Gary Evans finished well down the field as
Stephen Leaney birdied the last hole to win the Victorian Open in Melbourne by
one stroke from fellow Australians Robert Allenby and Michael Clayton.
Melbourne amateur Geoff Ogilvy, the third-round leader, shot a 78 to finish six
behind. Leading scores (Australians unless stated, *denotes amateur):
283 - S Leaney 72, 72, 68, 71.
284 - R Allenby 74, 70, 73, 67; M Clayton 75, 68, 69, 72.

JOHN Linklater's otherwise excellent article, Flower of Flanders (November 11),
was marred by one factual error. According to Haig's biographer, Duff Cooper,
the Field Marshal's earldom was accompanied by a grant of #100,000, not
#900,000 as stated.
This grant pales, however, when compared to that given to Wellington, who some
100 years earlier received #500,000 and a dukedom before the Battle of Waterloo.

GRANGE go into the winter break with a two-point advantage over the pack in the
national league, with arch-rivals MIM having now moved into third place just
four points off the pace to keep the championship race wide open.
The emergence of MIM has unquestionably been the story of the season so far,
for after five rounds of matches they had suffered four defeats and were
beginning to look like relegation material.
Then goalkeeper Alistair McLean returned after injury and the club signed Jamie
Stokoe from Stirling. It's been a drive up the table since then, culminating in
the best result of their season on Saturday, a 2-0 victory over Menzieshill.
Grange were convincing winners at Meadowbank against Insights Inverleith. They
had four goals to spare at the end but it could have been more as Inverleith
were fragile in defence.
For Grange's midfield star Gary Boomer this was his last game of the campaign.
He is off to study in Australia in the new year for three months and will then
stay over to play in the Australian championship.
Boomer signed off with two goals in their 6-2 victory and they will definitely
miss his drive and vision in the second half of the season.
Apart from MIM, this could also be good news for second-placed Western, but
they will have to be more assertive if they are to harbour thoughts of
grandeur. They were 4-0 victors at Pender Udding-ston, with Graham Joyce's
second successive hat trick, but three of their goals were delayed until the
final quarter.
Ciba Kelburne, meanwhile, disposed of Clydesdale 5-3, with top marksman Dave
McKay twice finding the target to bring his tally for the season to 10, while
in the second division Edinburgh University have gone top after beating
Perthshire 6-0.

GREAT BRITAIN moved closer to the Atlanta Olympics next summer when they
amassed four superb points over the weekend, with Scottish players fashioning
victories over Germany - 2-1 - and China - 1-0 - in the Olympic Qualifying
Tournament in Cape Town.
The prize scalp was unquestionably that of Germany, beaten finalists in
Barcelona. It was the Scottish captain Pauline Robertson who set them on the
road to an unexpected triumph when she opened the scoring in the second minute.
The Bonagrass Grove player hit the target from an acute angle after Jane
Sixsmith had released the pass.
This was Robertson's second goal of the tournament and it was to lay the
foundation for one of Britain's finest performances, although Germany equalised
10 minutes after half-time with a score from their captain, Franziska
Hentschell.
The inevitable, however, was delayed for only nine minutes until Great Britain
won their second penalty corner of the game. It was taken by Dundonian Susan
Fraser, who hammered home a fine drive to give Great Britain their first
victory over Germany since 1988.
Yesterday China were disposed of and it goes without saying that the
match-winner came from the stick of another Scot, Rhona Simpson.
Speaking afterwards, the British coach Sue Slocombe said: ``We set the personal
target of five points after three games and, now that that has been achieved,
we can look forward with confidence to the remaining part of our programme in
the hope that our place in Atlanta, among the top five nations here, is sealed
before we play South Africa in our final match.''

I WAS on my way to a wedding in America last month, flying high over the
Atlantic and marvelling at the technology which kept us in the air, when my
thoughts turned to Percy Pilcher, the Glasgow naval architect who should have
had his place in history.
It must have been an association of ideas. For the wedding destination was
North Carolina, where the famous Wright brothers became the first men to fly.
And it was Percy Pilcher, who worked at the Fairfield and John Brown shipyards,
who would almost certainly have stolen their thunder if the fates had not
intervened.
Exactly the same age as Wilbur Wright, the Scots lad was four years ahead of
the Americans in his development of powered flight, having built his first
glider at his digs in Byres Road, Glasgow.
After trials on farmland at Cardross, Percy was due to give a demonstration in
Kent on a day of foul weather. Not wishing to disappoint the large crowd, he
went ahead - and crashed. Percy was dead at 32. The Wrights followed his course
of development and gained their immortal place in aviation history.
There is no place in life for runners-up, I was thinking to myself as the plane
touched down and my party of Scottish friends prepared to meet the American
relatives for the first time.
Weddings may be much the same the world over but the Americans can add a charm
to an occasion which I find appealing. Their customs are also rather different.
For example, the sit-down meal takes place not on the wedding day, as in
Scotland, but on the previous evening, when it is hosted by the bridegroom's
parents under the name of the Rehearsal Dinner.
On this pleasant occasion the groom's widowed mother, Ayliffe Macphail from
Glasgow, welcomed her American guests with true Scottish hospitality (it
included a taste of the Macphail whisky from Elgin) and looked forward to
seeing them all again next day.
Before then, however, there would be a Wedding Day Brunch for ladies only, at
which the beautiful bride, Winborne Thorn, introduced her bridesmaids and
explained how she came to know them.
It was a longish story. For, while it wasn't exactly a case of Seven Brides for
Seven Brothers, it was certainly Seven Bridesmaids for Seven Groomsmen.
Meanwhile, it was a different story for the bridegroom, Cameron Macphail,
former assistant at Drumpellier, who went to America as a professional golfer
and now mixes in the company of the Tom Watsons and Fuzzy Zoellers.
Cameron spent his wedding morning at golf, with a stunning victory over one of
his distinguished groomsmen, Forrest Fezler, the man once pipped at the post by
Hale Irwin for the US Open.
With the preliminaries over, we turned up at the Methodist Church in the
village of Duck, a charming resort on the Atlantic coast, where they are not
unfamiliar with Scottish culture.
For it was to this corner of America that our heroine, Flora Macdonald,
emigrated after serving her term in the Tower of London for aiding the escape
of Bonnie Prince Charlie after Culloden. There are still Macdonalds everywhere,
as can be seen at their massive Highland games.
Appropriately, this Scots-American wedding was another tartan occasion, with
both the groom and his lawyer brother, Roderick, resplendent in kilt, and the
bagpipes played by a gigantic American Highlander.
The organ was augmented by trumpet and flute and the beautiful soprano of
Deborah Kasten gave us a memorable rendering of the Lord's Prayer.
After a sermon of fire and brimstone, we repaired to the magnificent beach
house of the bride's parents, Bill and Marion Thorn, where they entertained 200
guests to a sumptuous reception. The Scots and Americans were on such instant
and gloriously good terms as to prove not only the strength of old bonds but
the potential of human beings, given half a chance, to foster good relations.
So we sang and danced and strolled on the balconies, the heady champagne
tempered by warm sea breezes which rose from the golden beach below. If this
was not heaven, it was the nearest that some of us will see.
And, on a new day, I was driving nearby when I realised I was in Kittyhawk.
Yes, this was where those Wright brothers wrote their names into history.
So I pulled into the memorial field, where they had carried out the same
experiments as Percy Pilcher at Cardross. In the visitors' centre I joined the
audience to hear the full story of how the Americans had shown the way to the
stars.
As the enthusiastic presenter came close to arousing a patriotic cheer, I bit
my tongue - and then decided to ask him a question: Have you ever heard of a
man called Percy Pilcher?
Unsure of what I might reveal next, he blushed a little and assured me that he
knew all about Percy Pilcher from Scotland. Yes, he conceded, it was indeed
Percy who was four years ahead of the game. Yes, he might well have replaced
the Wright brothers in aviation history. But he was killed, wasn't he?
Yes, Percy was killed. But in the home of the Wright brothers, whose names will
live for a thousand years, it brought some satisfaction to know that they at
least recognise a great Scotsman who missed out on immortality by the narrowest
thread of mischance.

Hearts 2, Hibernian 1
IF THEY ever discover his secret, Jim Jefferies could become a wealthy man. At
Falkirk, he showed spectacularly that he had a rare talent for getting a team
out of bother by injecting new blood. He is doing the same trick at Tynecastle,
this time giving the old Jam Tarts a foreign blood transfusion with results
that have been quite astonishing.
Since he put all three new men in the team, Jefferies has watched his side go
from bottom of the table to fifth top inside a fortnight.
To be fair, Pasquale Bruno, Gilles Rousset, and Hans Eskilsson had only
supporting roles in this thoroughly deserved derby win but, as John Millar said
afterwards, their very presence has given the dressing room a breath of fresh
air.
The actual goal-scoring was done by two much more familiar faces in John
Robertson and Millar himself. Between them, they have done enough damage to
Hibs to warrant severe notoriety in Easter Road circles. Robertson finds it
hard not to score in capital derbies, his penalty yesterday giving him a total
of 23 in these games, while Millar, with far fewer opportunities, was scoring
his third when he put Hearts ahead in the first half.
It was a goal they had been well overdue, but when Hibs, who at no time played
to their potential, equalised with a fine strike by young Chris Jackson, the
derby looked open enough. However, the penalty, awarded without serious dispute
after Gary Locke was brought down by Andy Millen, came so soon afterwards that
Hearts' confidence did not have time to dip and they finished good winners.
The day ended in deep depression for Michael O'Neill, who had been elated in
midweek after having scored twice for Northern Ireland in their 5-3 win over
Austria.
He was booked in the last minute for dissent, booked a second time for a foul
on Alan Johnston, and thus shown the red card. However, he could be in even
more trouble with the SFA after remonstrating with the fourth official, Bill
Crombie, on the touchline, and then being seen on television booting a fire
extinguisher on his way up the tunnel.
His manager, Alex Miller, was not enamoured. ``I was disappointed with Michael.
At a time when when we need experienced players, it was foolish behaviour.''
The Hibs manager was also annoyed that his team gave away the penalty and so
quickly lost the boost the equaliser had given them, before revealing that
young striker Kevin Harper, who missed the game, will be out until Christmas
because of a dislocated shoulder and, by a harsh coincidence, Graham Mitchell,
who has just recovered from injury and has not played this season, will be out
a similar length of time with the same injury.
The other Edinburgh manager, Jefferies, was in buoyant mood. ``I thought we
played well and deserved the win. Before Hibs scored, we could have been two or
three up.'' Jefferies also sprang to O'Neill's defence, saying: ``He was
unfortunate.''
Hearts' Italian import, Bruno, had a reputation as being the hardest man in
Serie A in his day, but to date has been a model of discipline in Scotland,
although he looked as if he was ready to let loose that infamous temper in the
first minute of the derby when he was flattened by a sliding tackle from Evans.
Next minute, Evans came in, again a little harshly, but before the referee
could give the foul, Bruno had carried on with a flying tackle at Chris
Jackson, his boot landing on the young midfield man's thigh. The Italian was
booked, but Jefferies believes that did him a favour, because he did cool down
and was never in trouble again.
Any chances that were made in those early stages fell to Hearts, their opening
goal, then, not being unexpected, and laid on by one of their best players,
Gary Locke, whose cross took a spin off a defender's foot. When it came down,
John Millar nipped between Hunter and Leighton to knock it over the line.
Hibs needed only six minutes of the second half to put themselves back into the
game and it is a goal 22-year-old Chris Jackson will always remember, his first
for the club. He took a pass in midfield from McGinlay and ran forward before
confidently smacking the ball out of Rousset's reach from 20 yards.
The celebrations were short as Hearts restored their advantage within three
minutes with the penalty scored by Robertson.
Millen and Hunter were others booked during the action which was always hectic
and often thrilling, particularly in the second half.
With 15 minutes left, Hibs replaced Darren Jackson, who had spent the previous
24 hours in bed with flu, with Mickey Weir and soon after Hearts took off
Robertson, who had taken a knock, bringing on Colquhoun.
HEARTS - Rousset, Locke, Ritchie, Mackay, Berry, Bruno, Johnston, Eskilsson,
Robertson, Fulton, Millar. Substitutes - Lawrence, Colquhoun, Hamilton.
HIBS - Leighton, Millen, Tortolano, McGinlay, Tweed, Hunter, McAllister, C
Jackson, Evans, D Jackson, O'Neill. Substitutes - Weir, Dods, Miller.
Referee - K W Clark (Paisley).

Kilmarnock 1, Motherwell 1
ALEX McLeish looked closely at a chair in the interview room at Rugby Park
early on Saturday evening.
It must have appeared very inviting to the big fellow, the temptation to slump
down, perhaps almost overpowering, take the weight off pins that may have been
complaining just a little after having been cajoled into such strenuous action.
But no, the Motherwell manager was having none of that, and contented himself
by remaining upright while sipping quietly from a can of glucose drink as he
chatted about the afternoon's goings on.
A few hours earlier, McLeish had felt it necessary again to lace up his boots
for the first time in ages, so horrendous was Motherwell's injury and illness
situation, and once his second wind was taken on to the field, McLeish then led
by example.
On an afternoon when the Fir Park side's regular central defenders were either
suspended or on the panel, McLeish not only turned out himself but, at first
glance, appeared to be surrounded by guys hardly old enough to shave. The end
result was a point against Kilmarnock and a performance that had McLeish almost
glowing with pride.
``It was a tough game,'' said the red-faced manager, ``and I am really proud of
the young lads. There were four reserve players in there and they played
extremely well. It was tough at times but it was nice to see a little character
being shown.''
McLeish then produced a sheet of paper like a magician conjures up rabbits, and
on the list were the names of the men excused duty. He went through the list
one by one, saying whether this man or that would be ready soon again to answer
the call. But do not be too surprised if McLeish is again pulling on a jersey
when Falkirk pop into Fir Park on Saturday - not that his presence on the field
would be a bad thing.
Character, composure, and a liberal sprinkling of ability were much in evidence
after just seven minutes when Alex Burns finished off some delightful work by
Paul Lambert for the game's opener.
However, the Motherwell goal was answered in fine style 17 minutes later when
Ally Mitchell seemed confused as to which foot to use to strike the ball, but
when his mind was made up, the little fellow sent in a shot which appeared
radio-controlled, leaving keeper Scott Howie, mouth gaping, to view the
situation in dismay.
Kilmarnock's men appear to relish the task of attacking, going about their
business with glee, and if a little more composure had been displayed where,
and when, it really mattered, perhaps McLeish's afternoon would not have
concluded quite so satisfactorily.
Indeed, the point gained by Kilmarnock could not halt the club from slipping
down to second-bottom rung in the premier ladder. Kilmarnock manager Alex
Totten is proud of his men's attacking style, but more work is needed.
Tom Brown left Rugby Park in the early evening with despondency for company.
The little home striker had been withdrawn nine minutes from the conclusion of
the match - a decision greeted with communal disagreement by the blue-and-white
brigade - and he was none too amused.
An old guy with red hair had seen off the attacker, as he has done to so many
others in his time. Perhaps it was the glucose drink. You'll have to tell us
its secret contents, Alex, and we can all try it.

THE law has always been an ass but now it appears to have gone completely
raving bonkers.
On the one hand we have procurators-fiscal complaining of being under-staffed
and under-funded. As a consequence a large percentage of cases are not
proceeded with, police custody cases are regularly released, serious bail
offences are ignored, and Falkirk District Court fails to open. Simultaneously
totally irrational light sentences are handed down to serious criminals.
On the other hand we are regularly jailing cannabis growers, non-TV licence
holders, and other miscellaneous fine defaulters.
To complete the circle, despite the alleged lack of resources, the Glasgow
procurator-fiscal's department continues to wage a vendetta against players of
Rangers. I am only glad they never go to see ice hockey.

THE big bang is coming to property conveyancing in Scotland. Solicitors have
jealously guarded their monopoly over the provision of conveyancing and
executry services, but they are to lose their grip on this lucrative market by
the autumn of next year.
The Scottish Office, in implementing the Government's desire to abolish the
Scottish solicitors' domination in this field, has introduced the Scottish
Conveyancing and Executry Board.
The Law Society of Scotland and its solicitor members are, predictably,
vehemently opposed to non-solicitors providing these services. The society
claims that there is no such thing as a ``monopoly'' in their profession.
It is true that a prospective client may ``shop around'' for a competitive fee,
between solicitors, but that still does not give the public a real choice in
the kind of service they require.
Competition in regard to fees is important to the public, but of far greater
importance is the element of protection. To the vast majority of the public,
buying or selling their home is the single most important transaction of their
lives. Few members of the public give any consideration to the possibility of
an error by their solicitor in the transaction, and even less consideration to
what happens if such a mistake should occur.
I was formerly a successful property developer until I fell victim to the
solicitor profession and its insurers. I now have a compelling reason to
concern myself with the niceties of the kind of consumer protection offered by
Scottish solicitors to their clients in the form of professional indemnity
insurance.
From the bitter experience of almost 10 years of litigation I can tell you that
professional indemnity insurance, particularly in the terms set up by the Law
Society, is the opposite of consumer protection. Professional indemnity, when
properly referred to, is an insurance protection for the solicitor and not
protection for the client. The client is owed no obligation from a negligent
solicitor or his professional indemnity insurers.
The client has only a remedy for losses which he can establish under common
law, and believe me, there are plenty if solicitors out to stop you from
obtaining a decree for damages against one of their colleagues.
In 1986, my then solicitors forgot to include wording in a title document for
access to a housing development in which I was involved. A few days later,
realising his mistake, the solicitor, in his rush to correct his first mistake,
made a further fatal error.
The firm denied negligence for more than six years, necessitating a series of
court actions. Throughout the past nine years I have followed the advice of my
solicitors in trying to remedy the situation which has stemmed from the first
firm's admitted negligence and now the negligence of my second firm of
solicitors which, like their colleagues before them, they also strenuously deny.
As a consequence of the actions of the first two firms of solicitors, the case
has become one of enormous legal and administrative complexity. Michael Smith,
of a third firm of solicitors, genuinely tried for 18 months to obtain what he
considered to be a reasonably fair compensation for my losses, but failed.
He was forced, quite properly, to withdraw from acting for me, because of a
conflict between our interests. Mr Smith entered into extensive correspondence
with all the parties, and in particular with the Law Society, but was
stonewalled.
So intensive were Mr Smith's efforts that he later presented me with an account
totalling almost #49,000. The hearts of the office-bearers of the Law Society
are made of granite. The best they were prepared to do was to express their
concern and they are unwilling to investigate the misconduct allegations, until
all court proceedings are at an end. By that time we will all have forgotten
what the problem was.
My case against the first firm of solicitors had been so prejudiced that I was
advised by Mr Smith to abandon my court action, pay them the expenses of
#21,966 and start from the beginning, suing both firms jointly in the Court of
Session.
Despite their admission of negligence I did indeed pay the firm #21,966.85 as I
was advised.
I had no alternative. In Michael Smith's words: ``The Law Society has exhibited
the most appalling cynicism in failing to deal with the issues raised. In my
view, it has so disregarded professional standards and ethics in Iain
McIntyre's case that it has shown itself unfit to regulate the profession.''
I have received a letter of apology from the Sun Alliance Group, who are the
lead insurers for the profession, in respect of their failure to admit the
negligence years earlier, when they should have done.
The losses which have accrued have been quantified by a series of lawyers,
including senior counsel, at #2.75m plus interest and expenses. The best offer
in settlement that I have received would leave little over after recovering the
total liabilities for expenses to date of approximately #171,000, and all this
from a conveyancing mistake.
The frightening aspect is that this could happen to anyone if their solicitor
makes a mistake. The indemnity system is set up in such a way as to make it
unlikely that an aggrieved client will achieve partial, let alone full,
recovery.
My case is said to be a paradigm of all that is wrong with the system. Through
the publicity which has attended my case, I have received more than 100
contacts from others in similar situations, and they are only the tip of a
large iceberg.
The solicitors' profession, through the Law Society, has demonstrated itself
unwilling to meet responsibilities to clients when matters go wrong. Solicitors
say: ``As a profession we must accept that we are different from others in the
so-called competitive market place. Integrity for a solicitor is not just a
valuable asset, it must be a prerequisite of his make up. If that costs us
money - the public trust it generates is worth every penny.''
In my experience, this is a promise honoured in the breach. It is the promise
of a profession not fit to be trusted. It is false because the bond of trust is
used to mislead clients into a perception that the Law Society is there to help
if matters go wrong. It shamefully protects the interests of its solicitor
members at the expense of the public.
The prospect of a real alternative for the public is a breath of fresh air to
be welcomed. There are many reasons for the public to have confidence that
qualified conveyancers will provide a better service to clients than many
solicitors provide in respect of competence and all aspects of consumer
safeguards.
The Scottish Conveyancing and Executry Board has an enormous opportunity before
it and will be judged not on the value of their fees, but on the effectiveness
of their public safeguards.
Gaining redress for a mistake, I believe, will not be like trying to open a
dozen oysters without a knife, as it is with solicitors.

THE articles on facing the pain of child loss dealt well with the delicate
issue of pregnancy loss (November 13). Miscarriage, which is the focus of my
ongoing research, affects up to 15% of couples and has long-lasting effects in
terms of the stress and anxiety it causes, not only for the mother, but also
for the father.
Indeed, stress in itself is a possible cause of pregnancy loss and thus, in
some circumstances, an unfortunate vicious circle may arise.
Given that miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy, support
groups such as the Society for Counselling and Information on Miscarriage and
the Miscarriage Association offer an invaluable service. Funding depends on an
increased awareness of such a disturbing problem and scientific research is
essential if some types of miscarriage are to be prevented.

CAN we get some facts straight, rather than simply swallow the tosh from the
past and present propagandists for Glasgow? The city is considerably more
violent than any other mainland British city. It is almost certainly, per
capita, the murder capital of Europe. And murders are up over 30% on last year.
The chief constable adds, comfortingly, that the place is ``awash'' with
firearms. The hard-drug problem is horrific. Glasgow has been called the
world's injecting capital by the World Health Organisation and any time now
some poor soul will receive the dubious posthumous accolade of being the 100th
overdose victim. A dear green place, indeed.
I did a search of a newspaper library database yesterday which takes in all
Scottish and national newspapers and I could find just eight mentions - and
defensive ones at that - by Pat Lally about the twin problems of drugs and
violence in the past five years. Doubtless I pressed the wrong buttons.
take a walk along Saracen Street, Pat, and see the poor, stumbling drug-wrecked
wretches for yourself. drug money is being laundered through, among other
conduits, private-hire companies in the city, which the council is meant to be
licensing and administering.
Then you look around a city which is to become a focus for architects and
designers in 1999 and you look at the dross and collapsing slums masquerading
as civic housing and architecture and you can't help sniggering and feeling
thankful you don't actually have to live in them.
Of course there are many good things in the city, but there are severe and
worsening problems which should be urgently addressed. My book, Mean City, is a
work of fiction, although certain events may draw resonances, but it actually
tends to sanitise matters rather than reflect the reality. John Burrowes was
right.

<HEADLINE>Shell's Nigeria boycott strategy backfires</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHELL'S attempts to fend off boycott threats over its activities in Nigeria
backfired yesterday when the daughter of one of the country's leading
dissidents accused the oil giant of misrepresenting her and her father.
The company placed full-page advertisements in several Sunday newspapers
arguing against the ``kneejerk'' application of oil sanctions or boycotts on
Nigeria following the execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.
Campaigners from Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace had picketed Shell petrol
stations on Saturday, branding the company's involvement in Nigeria as
unethical.
However, yesterday's ads insist that far from devastating the Nigerian region
of Ogoniland - as environmentalists have claimed - Shell has spent millions of
pounds on environmental improvements there.
Shell also defended a policy of quiet diplomacy with the Nigerian regime,
arguing that worldwide protests may in fact have hastened the execution of Mr
Saro-Wiwa and eight other human rights activists.
In support, it quoted Wura Abiola - daughter of Chief Moshood Abiola, the
jailed winner of the last Nigerian elections - who told BBC2's Newsnight: ``The
regime does not react well to threats. I believe that this is the way of
showing that they will not listen to threats.''
Ms Abiola reacted with outrage to the use of her name, accusing Shell of
``insensitivity'' in using her words out of context without warning her.
She said: ``Using my words selectively in this way associates me and my views
with Shell's own position. I refute this in the strongest possible terms.''
Meanwhile, Shetland councillors may use their #6.3m stake in Shell to try to
influence the company's policies on Nigeria.
Convener Canon Lewis Smith said yesterday: ``If little Shetland Islands Council
can do anything to protest against an abuse of human rights then I think we
should.''
Canon Smith stressed he was speaking personally.
At the last count the council held 850,000 Shell shares in the holding company
Shell Transport and Trading Ltd.
q.A new production vessel being built for the North Sea is to receive
protection from piracy.
The threat is being taken so seriously that the barge which will tow her
through the hazardous waters of Southeast Asia has been registered under the
British flag to allow for Royal Navy protection should pirates strike.
The Anasuria, the floating production vessel for the Guillemot and Teal fields,
108 miles east of Aberdeen, is nearing completion in Japan and will set sail
for the UK next month.
There have been a number of piracy incidents in Southeast Asian waters in
recent years, including an abortive attempt to board the Shell tanker Stellata
in August.

<TEXT>
A NEW #100,000 pipe organ, funded by an anonymous benefactor, has been
installed at Kilmacolm Old Kirk in Renfrewshire.
The organ, built by Peter Collins of Leicestershire, received its first public
airing on Saturday night in the shape of an inaugural recital by award-winning
organist Carleton Etherington and featured in a service of dedication yesterday
when it was played by church organist and choirmaster Kenneth Walton.
The nineteenth-century church, incorporating part of the original
thirteenth-century building, had no musical accompaniment until 1875, when the
minister introduced a harmonium.
The first pipe organ, which was powered by water, was installed in 1903 at a
cost of #800 and remained in the church until the 1980s, when it fell into
serious disrepair. It was replaced by an electric organ, which accompanied
services until a few months ago and has now been gifted to a church in
Kilwinning.

AS I was getting off a bus I stumbled and was in considerable pain. The bus
driver phoned for an ambulance, which took me to the Victoria Infirmary in
Glasgow.
The doctor asking my name and confirming that the injury appeared to be my
ankle, rather than examining me, reprimanded me for calling an ambulance,
asserting that there were only two on duty.
Despite the considerable pain and shock I was suffering I could hardly believe
my ears. I said I had been unable to walk, and did not know how badly I was
injured.
He then added that I might have prevented someone with heart failure from
getting an ambulance and I could have got a bus or a taxi.
I think it is unacceptable for doctors to talk directly to individual patients
about such matters. If the hospital wishes to restrict the use of ambulances
then it should appeal to people through general publicity and for any doctor to
put this subject as his first priority when dealing with patients suffering
from pain and shock is surely not acceptable.

THERE was a time when Gina Sim dreaded the approach of night. Alone in her
double bed, her two little girls fast asleep next door, she would often lie
awake into the early hours, racked with anxieties she could cope with during
the day, but which darkness magnified into doom-laden disasters.
As the wife of an offshore oil worker, her greatest fear was that something
would happen to her husband, hundreds of miles away in the North Sea. She had
no-one to turn to during those endless, haunted nights, as her family and
friends would only worry about her if disturbed at such unsocial hours.
It was the Chinook helicopter disaster in 1986 which spurred her to take
control of her fears and channel them into something positive. Shocked by the
tragedy, the Polmont housewife also felt guilty at her own relief that her
husband, Peter, who had been flying that day, had arrived home safely, while 45
families would never see their loved ones again.
Determined to do something to help, she placed an advert in the local newspaper
and organised a charity night for fellow ``offshore wives'', which raised money
for the disaster fund.
Nine years on, the warmth of fellow-feeling discovered on that first evening
has grown to envelop hundreds of women throughout the UK. Sadly, it was fuelled
by further disaster striking the oil industry when, in 1988, the Piper Alpha
tragedy led to the formation of a support group in Central Scotland.
Since then, encouraged by the former chaplain to the Oil Industry, the Rev
Andrew Wylie, Owls (Offshore Women's Link Support) has spread its wings in a
vast network, bringing friendship and comfort to the lonely and distressed 24
hours a day.
On meeting Sim, a petite and attractive 37-year-old, it is hard to imagine her
ever having suffered the night terrors. Her voice is calm and reassuring and
the large, round glasses she often wears can give her a wise expression,
delightfully fitting for the founder and chairperson of a group called Owls.
``Like owls, we can contact each other in the dark, when our deepest fears take
over. No matter what time, day or night, women can call up one of our
counsellors for a chat or a moan about whatever is disturbing them,'' she says.
Having grown from a small support group into a registered charity, whose patron
is Lady Cullen, Owls, which was officially launched in 1991, has spent the past
18 months setting its house in order, organising a committee and training
co-ordinators to handle fund-raising, counselling and emergency response, all
of which were previously done on an ad-hoc basis.
With nine branches and more than 400 official members, the organisation is at
present on the verge of a UK-wide campaign to raise awareness about its
activities.
In addition to handling calls, which range from someone needing a friendly ear,
to threatened suicides, Owls also acts as a mediator between families and oil
companies.
``There have been times, when a child has broken a leg, or someone's mother has
been taken ill, when the women calling us have been afraid to approach the
company for fear of a black mark being    put against the name of the employee
involved. It all depends which employer     you are dealing with - some allow
women to call their partners offshore, some don't. In these instances we'll be
the go-between ask the company if they will tell the employee to phone home,''
says Sim.
Most companies are happy to deal with Owls, realising the benefits such a group
has for their employees' peace of mind. Many, Sim says, have been a tremendous
support, providing practical and financial sponsorship for the helpline and
publicity material, including their quarterly newsletter, The Hoot.
``There was some scepticism within the industry early on, with us being
regarded as yet another bunch of do-gooders. But we went out there and worked
hard at proving that the goodwill we have is there for a specific reason and
now both the industry and the offshore workforce are realising we are a force
to be reckoned with - as far as family support is concerned, we are the
experts.''
Forging links with oil and gas companies is an ongoing process. For the past
four years, members have attended the Leith International Conference on marine
and offshore safety, making contacts throughout Europe and the US. The benefits
of doing this were proved almost immediately, when Owls was asked to help by an
old woman in the south of England, who had long since lost touch with her oil
worker son in Norway.
``At our first Leith conference earlier that year, we had met representatives
from Statoil, in Norway, and so were able to call on them for assistance. They
checked their own files, without success, but gave us the number of the police
in the area he was believed to have been working in, and within the week,
mother and son were reunited,'' says Sim.
Owls also works closely with the industry on emergency response. In times of
emergency, when an oil company is having to cope with thousands of telephone
calls, the organisation will provide vital back-up support by offering
counselling to families and friends of ofshore workers. This applies whether or
not they are involved in the particular incident, as any disaster in the North
Sea will bring back memories of previous tragedies.
One occasion Sim remembers well was an incident involving a helicopter and
diving vessel, which led to one man's death. The company concerned decided to
call the next of kin of everyone else on board the vessel, to reassure them
before they heard about the accident through the media. However, one woman, on
hearing the words ``accident'' and your ``husband's diving vessel'', was thrown
into a panic and thought her husband had been killed.
``She called us up in a terrible state, and we rang the company to find out
what had happened. We were able to go back to the woman with the proper story
and we also asked her husband's company to call her again to reassure her, as
we knew she would feel bad later about the misunderstanding.''
As a matter of course, Owls members will visit sick or injured men in hospital,
if their partners or families cannot make the journey immediately, and will
offer childcare and financial support, where possible.
Their support services now also apply to the growing number of men who have
female partners working offshore. According to Sim, many of their calls are
from men who feel guilty they are not the ones working in the offshore
environment.
Owls is also proactive, organising education days in Aberdeen, which involve
visits to the heliport and RGIT Survival Centre - a place which instils fear in
many women.
``Women get an awful picture from their menfolk of what goes on in the survival
course, what with mock helicopter ditchings and fire-fighting. But when they
visit the centre and see what happens for themselves, there's a tremendous
relief at how safe and organised it actually is.
``For those who can't make the journey to Aberdeen, we also have videos of the
inside of a helicopter and on what life is like offshore and these go down very
well, particularly with the children. It gives them an idea of what happens to
dad when he goes to work - he no longer disappears into a black hole.''

YESTERDAY'S suicide bomber in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, was intent on
killing officials of the Egyptian government working in the embassy there. Some
were killed but even more of the 13 victims were Pakistanis. There is nothing
surgical about suicide bombs, but that hardly affects their main function which
is to terrorise by inflicting random death and suffering (there were more than
50 injured) and so compel the required political response. It will not be
forthcoming. President Mubarak's government will not give way to terrorist
pressure of this kind, though the question always is whether the mass of the
Egyptian population might eventually be frightened enough to acquiesce in the
fundamentalists' aims of imposing a religious state by force rather than
conviction. That Pakistan was the chosen location of the latest attack may not
mean that Egyptian diplomatic activities in the whole Muslim world, from
Morocco to Indonesia, are threatened. Because of its proximity to Afghanistan
and its role in supporting the Mujahaddin irregulars in the war against the
Soviet Union there, Pakistan has been left with a legacy of militant Islamic
groups and individuals residing in its territory. Attempts to expel these have
not always worked, and yesterday's incident will encourage its government to
redouble its efforts in this area.
That two different groups have claimed responsibility for the attack - one, in
intemperate language directed at its ``friendly'' rival, advertises the way in
which the militants are divided among themselves. But too much need not be read
into that for Gama'a al-Islamya and Jihad have managed to collaborate before.
There is no difference in their aims, which is to destabilise any attempt to
keep religion and state separate in Egypt, only in tactics, with Jihad,
previously at any rate, focusing its effort on highly-placed individuals (it
assassinated President Sadat in 1981), and Gama'a behaving like most terrorist
groups and attacking a wide spectrum of targets, the better to sow fear and
despair among the largest number of people. In this case, an additional,
possible the dominant, aim was to achieve the maximum publicity at relatively
low risk. It is easier to attack relatively ``soft'' targets in foreign
countries than it would be at home, and the very fact that it is the away
rather than the home front which is assaulted ensures even wider media
coverage.
There is no easy counter to such attacks which have to be endured, if only
after the most rigorous and continuous attempts to forestall them and apprehend
the would-be perpetrators before their intentions become their deed. The
Egyptian government will have to intensify its efforts to protect all its
diplomatic personnel and their places of work abroad. It will be able to enjoy
the sympathy and support of most other governments, including most other Muslim
governments, for few accept the aims of the fundamentalists. Most Muslims
themselves do not accept these aims. The Arab League issued a statement noting
how the dominant Arab and Muslim values are built on tolerance and empathy and
are against such vile acts of violence as affected Islamabad this week. The
Western world which may not always know as much about Islam as it should, must
always be aware of this vital distinction, which is exactly the same as that
which separates the Jewish extremist murderers of Mr Rabin from the mainstream
traditions of Judaism which he represented himself.

AS a couple who have never used the Pill, it's been interesting to consider the
present controversy about its safety, looking on from the sidelines as emotions
and anguish have come bubbling up to the surface.
But while the war of words, not to mention legal battles, have raged over this
most-marketed and most public of contraceptives, it is worth stating, despite a
natural reserve when it comes to making what is essentially a private matter
public, that there is a safe, cheap and totally reliable alternative to the
Pill.
That's natural family planning. My wife and I have been using it successfully
for nearly 20 years, and in that time neither of us has bombarded either of our
bodies with hormones, spent money on the vast list of devices that seek to
divorce intercourse from conception, or regarded family planning as the single
concern of either sex.
To be honest, as Catholics, we never did think there was any alternative. Cold
logic leads one, regardless of one's reading of Humanae Vitae, the famous
encyclical on family planning, to conclude that the Pill is all about
bombarding the woman's body with hormones.
The plain truth is that, despite all the marketing hype in the world from the
drug companies, it can hardly be argued that the Pill taker is being truly
liberated.
We began our journey along the road of natural family planning shortly after
our first son was born.
All we needed to know was taught to us by the late Dr Maura O'Reilly of St
Francis Nursing Home, where the baby was born.
In those days my wife filled in her temperature charts, and the great ritual of
the morning was the five minutes in bed while the all-important fertility
thermometer was used and read.
The minuscule rise in temperature, immediately following ovulation, pinpointed
the fact that it had taken place, usually around day 14, half way through the
cycle. After that, although we always added a few days for safety, intercourse
could take place.
We even got a great laugh out of a set of charts we sent away to Ireland for:
they came complete with red baby stickers, for danger days, and green ones for
all clear.
For sheer humour it beat any of the mechanical and chemical rivals on the
market, but child spacing is a serious business, and we kept religiously, if
you'll excuse the pun, to those charts.
What did happen, however, is we both came into tune completely with my wife's
body. Temperature, combined with other signs, pinpointed the days of ovulation
without fail. Secure in the knowledge that sperm can live for up to seven days
before ovulation, if we didn't want to conceive then we avoided the days up to
ovulation too.
Many years, four children, and sadly one miscarriage later - an event which
really put intercourse, conception, life and death into their true perspective
- we are so well attuned that we don't need a chart to know when intercourse is
to be avoided.
To be honest, the greatest drawback of natural family planning is that at the
very time you want to avoid intercourse, your wife is at her most attractive.
It is nature's way of preserving the species, and underlines the essential link
between intercourse and conception. It's the time for restraint, to remind
yourself of the effect of another child on your wife's body, the welfare of the
whole family, and your finances.
Most of all, it lays the responsibility, fair and square, at the door of
husband and wife, equal and opposite - neither taking chemicals, having
operations, or using strange bits of metal or rubber.
If the sacrifice of a short-lived pleasure is the price to pay, plus a wait for
a few more days, then so be it: natural family planning is a constant reminder
that you are in the parenthood business together.
All this stands in remarkable contrast to the Pill. But I cannot fathom why the
women's movement has not cottoned on to natural family planning. It calls on
every man to co-operate fully with his wife as the female body and cycle
dictates his pace. It does put the woman firmly in command of her own fertility
and, unlike the Pill, there's no environmental fall out.
We may well have been the cause of the felling of the odd tree, to turn it into
paper for charts, over the years, but my wife hasn't been passing artificial
hormones out of her body, into the sewage, into the water cycle, and storing up
trouble for both men and women, now and in the future.
So let's get the great Pill panic in perspective. There is a natural answer to
the control of fertility.
The only drawbacks are that it calls for complete trust between husband and
wife in a loving and stable marriage, hasn't any appeal to profit-hungry drugs
giants, and, most damningly of all, in a society obsessed by sex as pleasure
without consequence, calls for chastity.
But I've yet to meet a group of women taking legal action against the printers
of charts.

I ONCE visited an abattoir. The animals awaiting their fate stood in an
enclosure which funnelled them into a zig-zag corridor affair, made of metal
railings. The same thing is used at ski resorts to get you through the
turnstiles at cable-car stations. As a not-very-confident skier, setting out
each morning in deep trepidation, the ``lamb to the slaughter'' analogy was not
lost on me. Now banks are using the same system, although the metal railing is
replaced with a crimson cord. Perhaps they are telling us we are being fleeced,
but nicely.
I have discovered one advantage to this abattoir-style queue in banks. You get
to overhear some interesting conversations. People forget that this is not a
normal, straggling queue, but that we are quite closely packed. Not long ago a
couple of mums were discussing a friend of theirs who lived some distance away.
She had young children, and had evidently separated from her husband. He had
left with little warning, and these two mums had no good words for him. After a
couple of years she had found a ``man friend'', as they called him, but was
quite uncertain how much to tell her children. Things were getting to the point
where they were thinking of pooling resources, moving in together, but the kids
had only met the man once, and apparently had no idea that mum was going out
with him. The key is in the word ``apparently''.
One of my informants had recently met the mum and her children, and the gang of
kids had gone off to play. Much later her own children had announced that
``so-and-so's mum is in love with a man, and they are all going to live with
him''. The kids were all pleased with the idea, especially the boy because ``he
drives a cool car'', and they were just waiting for mum to come clean.
How had they found out? They had watched their mum, seen her become happy
again, and they trusted her that she would only fall for someone really nice.
While they presumably loved their father, they had worked out for themselves
that he would play no great role in their lives and were willing to give this
new guy a shot. It seemed that the mum had not rubbished her departed husband
to their children, and she had retained their respect for that. In turn, they
had let her get on with things her way, and had realised she was being
protective of them rather than secretive. Not bad for junior school-age
children.
I'll probably never know the end of this story, because at that point one of
the women was at the head of the queue. She did say, though, that she had
phoned her friend and told her that the children knew all about her plans,
which came as something of a welcome surprise. So perhaps there are happy
endings in real life. Maybe I'll give up hole-in-the-wall cash machines and in
future will shuffle forward around the crimson rope to find out. As long as I
don't find myself inside a cable car, I'll be fine......

FOLLOWING your article on tall stories by Patrick Brogan, I wish to assure you
that the story of the urine sample in the small whiskey bottle being stolen is
absolutely true.
It happened to me nearly 38 years ago on my way to the ante-natal clinic at
Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow.
I had to go on two buses, so I can only assume that it was taken by someone who
must have had a very peculiar experience when he uncorked it.
I would have loved to have seen the expression on his face.

SHINTY
THE winter's first real snow-fall in the north put paid to a number of fixtures
on the card, inflicting the worst damage so far on what has been a relatively
postponement-free calendar. Main casualty was Newtonmore's Marine Harvest
premier-league game against Oban Camanachd, originally lost on the first day of
the season.
At Cannich, Fort William made no mistake at the second time of asking against
Strathglass in the Keyline MacAulay Cup first-round replay. Fort struggled to
get to grips with the lively first-division side and slippery conditions in the
first half, but still turned round two goals ahead, thanks to Victor Smith and
Ally Ferguson.
Dereck Cameron with a double, one a penalty, and Ferguson again put the game
beyond Strath's reach. Fort lost highly talented youngster John MacDonald, who
has just turned down a trial for Celtic FC, with a head injury which required
several stitches. MacDonald is one of Fort's brightest stars. The fact he has
pledged his future to the Fort, rather than take his chance with Celtic at
football, can only be seen as a boost to shinty in the area.
The race for the north division took a dramatic turn with leaders Caberfeidh
dumping second-placed Lochaber at Spean Bridge. It is the second time in three
weeks that Lochaber have led Caberfeidh, but have still ended up on the wrong
end of the result. This time Lochaber led by just one goal before Angus MacKay
and Neil Urquhart settled the issue.
Skye capitalised on Loch-aber's failure to win by beating Kinlochshiel, for all
that the island team played most of the game with just 11 men. David Pringle
was given his marching orders by referee John Henderson after just six minutes.
Cabers now lead Skye by two points with no less than four teams - Lochaber,
Kilmallie, Lochcarron, and Beauly - all giving chase, a further two points
adrift.
Lovat, with Roddy Munro returning to the side following the completion of a
nine-game ban, made light work of Inverness, winning 3-0 in the local derby at
the Bught Park. Munro was making his first appearance just days after having
been found guilty of assaulting a referee in a match in February. Gavin MacLeod
scored a first-half double and Craig Munro added a third.

STEVE Davis looks to have problems on and off the table following last night's
first-round exit from the #380,000 Royal Liver Assurance UK Championship at
Preston.
Davis refused to be drawn on recent revelations of his alleged love affair with
a 19-year-old dancer. ``I'm only going to talk about the events to do with the
championship,'' declared the six-times world and UK title-holder after a 9-6
defeat by 21-year-old Stephen Lee.
It was the first time Davis has lost to the ex-English amateur champion in four
meetings. It was also his first defeat at the opening hurdle of the game's
second most important event in 17 years.
Davis trailed 6-2 after their first session and then slipped 8-3 in arrears.
Gamely, he recovered to trail 8-6 before a superb 44 clearance put Lee through
to meet Neal Foulds for a place in the last 16.
Foulds beat Welsh veteran Doug Mountjoy 9-5, the highlight being a break of
113, although he missed the fifteenth black when on course to make a maximum
147.
There could be an upset today when Yorkshire newcomer Paul Hunter resumes 5-3
ahead against world No.6 Alan McManus. Both players compiled century breaks,
but Hunter finished with four frames in a row after the Scot had led 3-1.

THE ``think-tank'' headed by one-time SFA supremo Ernie Walker and given the
task of finding answers to the problems which beset Scottish football, is ready
to launch the biggest-ever survey of our national game.
A major company will be appointed to undertake a poll of supporters across the
country in a major effort to discover what improvements the people who watch
the game want to see on and off the field.
Nothing on this scale has ever been attempted before, and the results will
influence the thinking of the group Walker has gathered around him.
Yesterday Walker explained: ``There have been polls conducted in the past,
usually by newspapers, but this is going to be done professionally. Everyone
connected with the game will be polled. They will be asked about the standard
of the football they watch; about the facilities now available at the various
grounds; and about how they would like to see football develop in Scotland.
``Even just walking around Glasgow, I have been genuinely encouraged by the
support I have received from the man in the street.
``After all, the supporters are the life-blood of the game and we have already
met supporters' groups for discussions. But we know that we must reach as wide
a cross-section as possible in this survey.''
The appointment of the company to carry out the survey will be announced soon.
Interestingly, it will not be limited only to fans who attend games. Those who
watch on TV at home also will be polled for their views.
Says Walker: ``The television audience becomes more and more important to the
game. Millions of people now see most of their football on television and their
views have to be heard, because television puts a great deal of money into
football and sponsors plough cash in because of the TV audiences.
``Their thoughts on the game cannot be ignored. We already have had tremendous
input and co-operation, although, as always, there are entrenched attitudes
which must be overcome.
``For example, I have been asked why we need a foreign coach in to tell us
about `our game'. Well, Rinus Michels is a very gifted man, respected well
beyond his own country, Holland.
``In any case, surely it is to our credit that we are getting assistance from
one of the best coaches in the world. For one thing, it tells everyone that we
know we have problems. We recognise that these must be addressed, and we are
not too proud to ask for help.''

<HEADLINE>Bronze Age on silvery Tay NEWSVIEW: A dream home with a 2500-year-old design rises from the depths</HEADLINE>

A HIGH-rise building is going up in Loch Tay. It has planning permission,
building control warrant, engineer's and fire safety certificates.
Engineers Crouch Hogg Waterman of Glasgow have produced computer-generated
drawings to make sure that its proportions are correct. The foundations, driven
into one-and-a-half metres of mud, have been tested for safety.
Yet this building is not based on a new design. It is a crannog - a lake
dwelling house - an exact replica of a house built in the same loch, only three
miles away on the other side, two-and-a-half thousand years ago by people
living in the late Bronze Age.
Slowly rising from the shallows of the dark, choppy waters of the loch, a
matter of metres from the kayaks, speedboats, and sailboards of the water
sports centre at Croft-na-Caber near Kenmore, is the strangest of structures.
Fresh green leaves sprout from alder trunks transplanted from nearby woodlands
to the muddy bottom of the loch to provide the piles that make the foundations
of this house.
The floor-timbers are being laid in three layers just as they were all these
years ago by the extended family of up to 14 people who would have lived in it
with their animals.
How do we know about the floorplan, about the design using concentric circles,
about the walkway to the shore?
Because a small team from the Scottish Trust for Underwater Archaeology, led by
an American archaeologist Ms Barrie Andrian and Dr Nicholas Dixon of Edinburgh
University, have uncovered some of the secrets of Oakbank Crannog at nearby
Fearnan and are now using that knowledge to recreate a prehistoric crannog at
Kenmore.
For Dr Dixon, one of the few specialists in crannogs in the country, the
creation of a replica is a dream come true. Currently working on other crannog
sites in Scotland, he has left the bulk of the current construction work to his
colleague, Ms Andrian, a shipwreck archaeologist from Connecticut, and his
nephew Ben.
Ms Andrian, who came to Britain to work on the shipwreck of the Mary Rose, has
now made crannogs her life's work.
But with each discovery comes new knowledge and more questions - and more
frustration that there are not enough funds to carry out the research that is
needed into a part of our history which is unique to Scotland and Ireland.
They hope by Easter next year to have completed the reconstruction and to be
able to open it to the public.
That, however, provided funding is forthcoming, should be only the first step
in the creation of an environmental education centre. It will comprise a
permanent interpretive centre to house the artefacts recovered from the Oakbank
Crannog, interactive displays, a video of the reconstruction and underwater
archaeology work, and a number of spin-offs including courses in woodland
management, ancient crafts such as coppicing, and spinning, weaving, and dyeing.
As they have built this roundhouse on stilts, they have attempted to copy
faithfully the original crannog-builders' choice of material - alder and oak
for the piles, alder for the flooring, and hazel for the walls.
They will thatch it with reeds from the loch provided by one of their sponsors,
Tayreed Ltd of Errol.
Originally they tried to drive piles into the loch-bed simply by pushing them.
But it did not work. So, by trial and error, they discovered the method they
believe was used more than two thousand years ago - a wooden scaffolding tower
and cross-pole used to swivel the timber piles down and into the mud, like a
human drill.
``It was so exciting to discover that the method we used was the same method
they must have used. It made us feel so much closer to them,'' said Ms Andrian.
The timbers are interlocked with one-inch oak pegs, similar to those found in
the loch-bed at Fearnan, but the STUA team has had to incorporate extra safety
features because eventually it will be open to the public.
Their excavation has shown that long, straight alder timbers were used,
coppiced hazelwood branches, and oaks sturdier than we can find today in
Scotland. Ms Andrian is certain that the late Bronze Age people managed their
woodlands, else they would not have had such straight timber.
Alder has not been managed in the Loch Tay area for more than 30 years, making
it difficult for the team to find quality timber.
The original builders 2500 years ago were peaceful farmers, the archaeologists
believe. They have found no weapons and have concluded that the crannogs were
built in the water for defence - not from warring tribes but as a protection
from the wolves and bears that roamed the woodlands in those times.
The inner circle was the family's dwelling, the outer one for the sheep and
goats. Analysis of the samples found in Fearnan has shown that the original
dwellers grew barley and a very early form of wheat which, until this
particular excavation, had been attributed to the Romans.
This dwelling, however, was built 500 years before the Romans set foot in
Scotland.
The site was also littered with hazelnuts, wild cherries, sloes, and
cloudberries - showing sustainability. More interesting, however, are traces of
parsley - a herb which is not indigenous to Scotland but to continental Europe.
Were these, then, trading people?
Another find, this time at the site of the reconstructed crannog at Kenmore,
suggests they may have been. For when the archaeologists and their volunteers
drove their first piles into the mud, they discovered the remains of a dug-out
canoe - a 10-metre long single oak hollowed out. Only about 150 ancient canoes
have been found in Scotland so far - this one is among the five largest.
It was certainly used for cargo and had a removable stern which turned it into
what Ms Andrian describes as ``a hatchback canoe''.
The problems of conserving such an artefact pose too many problems for museums
in Scotland at present. So, the remains of the canoe have been returned to
their watery grave and covered over to await further work.
Only about a third of the Oakbank Crannog at Fearnan has been excavated to date
because analysis of finds is so expensive. But Ms Andrian and her colleagues
are in no doubt about the richness of their find, partly because water is such
an excellent preservative.
Add to that the fact that the crannog-dwellers simply dropped their rubbish
through a trap-door into the water, creating their own midden, and you have an
archaeologists' dream.
At Fearnan, the team found a dish with butter still in it - proof that the
early dwellers made butter and other dairy produce like cheese. But this is the
remnant of a culinary disaster - a pot that has been allowed by an inattentive
cook to catch fire.
When found alight, it has been thrown overboard in panic and has shattered
immediately on contact with the freezing water.
Pieces of textile have also been preserved, showing the early dwellers to be a
well-dressed people. For the archaeologists have found two: one twill, a style
of weaving previously associated with the thirteenth century AD.
But for each thing found another mystery has been created.
Where are the peoples' remains? Why have no tools been found? Did they pass
their tools on to later generations as we would pass on precious jewellery?
Could they swim? Did they worship or fear water? What were their religious
beliefs?
Most fascinating of all - why have most of the crannog sites been covered
deliberately by heavy boulders, probably at some point in the Middle Ages?
For the Oakbank Crannog at Fearnan is one of 18 in Loch Tay. Elsewhere, there
are 20 in Loch Awe, about 20 in Loch Lomond, and countless others in the other
lochs across Scotland.
Crannogs were built right up until the seventeenth century, although by then
they were probably clan refuges or hunting and fishing stations.
An edict was passed in the seventeenth century ordering all crannogs to be
destroyed because they offered too secure a refuge for Highlanders against the
English, according to Ms Andrian.
``It may be that something similar was passed earlier ordering them to be
covered up by boulders and that no documentary evidence of this has ever been
found,'' she suggests.
Whatever the reason, this almost certainly led to abandoned crannogs slowly
turning into islands in the middle of lochs.
As Barrie Andrian gazes from the shore to an island in the centre of Loch Tay
which once bore a sixteenth century Campbell stronghold, you can sense she is
itching to dig deep and find out if that ancient castle was built over another
prehistoric roundhouse.
She can reach out to the community who built their crannog at the other side of
the loch 2500 years ago.
But she wants more - to allow Scottish children to learn how their ancestors
lived in their platform roundhouses above the dark waters of the loch. The
modern child could visualise how their ancestors gazed at tree-strewn hills,
each night drawing up a section of the walkway so that the wolves and bears
could not cross the gap and penetrate their security.

JIM Telfer was not making excuses, he was giving reasons.
The national coaching director, deeply disappointed that the new regime could
not have been given something more tasty than the 15-15 Murrayfield draw
against Western Samoa, had a list not exactly as long as his arm but certainly
long enough to give the coaching team plenty to work on between now and the
Five Nations' Championship.
There was, he said, not enough source ball, not enough rhythm, too many missed
first-time tackles, the lineout was a shambles, and November is the wrong time
of year for Scots to be playing Test matches against Southern Hemisphere
opposition.
He also responded with typical candour to the suggestion that the Scottish
stand-off, Craig Chalmers, had experienced one of those days he would rather
forget.
Telfer spoke of the need to brush up on what he termed the ``core skills'' such
as line-kicking and restart kicks.
``If you go for touch, then you have to find it, and we were deficient in that
department,'' he said. ``Also, we were not as adventurous as I would have
liked. We did not play the way we expected to play. We moved the ball wide when
we should not have, and we have to be far more aware of decision-making in
these vital situations.''
But the most telling point he had to make was one which, in fairness, he has
been making all season and which he again made on Friday before the Test.
``Today the Scottish players were being asked to perform at a level two grades
up from what they have been used to in club games. This is especially true for
midfield players and for those involved in the hard, physical areas of
international play.
``As a rugby nation we should realise that we are coming off club rugby in
November and playing the top nations in the world. That is not an excuse for
what happened today. It is a reason.
``District rugby is a crucial preparation for the Five Nations' tournament but
we do not have it before the November international.''
Telfer added that when there was talk about district rugby it should not just
be about marketing and the number of spectators who might attend.
``We have to think about the players and about developing for them a pathway to
international rugby. It is not just about turnstiles and attracting spectators.
``The timing of this international (Scotland have lost heavily to New Zealand
and South Africa in the past two seasons) will have to be looked at. If it is
to be against Southern Hemisphere opposition then we have to remember that, for
them, it comes at the end of their season.''
Rob Wainwright, the new Scottish captain, who should be absolved from the
general mediocrity which surrounded him in the pack, had a close-up view of the
problems which afflicted Scotland in the lineout.
What had gone wrong? ``The throws were those we had done in practice but our
jumpers just didn't get as high as they did in practice. The Western Samoans
are a street-wise side and we weren't street-wise enough.''
Wainwright also voiced his concern over going into internationals straight from
club games. ``With the European championships starting for us next season, we
have to sort out whether it is to be districts or clubs. We have to get this
sorted out very quickly.''
Coach Richie Dixon added: ``We did not perform to the standard we expected,
especially in the lineout, but without taking anything away from the Samoans,
that was a game we should have won. We put them in pressure situations then
didn't capitalise.''
The Samoan captain, Pat Lam, said immediately afterwards that his reaction to
the draw was one of immense frustration. ``We scored two tries and that's good
but there's a hollow feeling that this was a game we should have won but
didn't.''
At the official dinner, Lam indicated just how much the game had meant to the
Samoans.
``We have gone through a bad time, being left out of the new inter-provincial
championship and losing players to rugby league. This was a big day for Western
Samoan rugby when we had to prove that we could still live at the top in
international rugby. Hopefully, we've done that.''

HOLLAND'S Seda Noorlander captured the singles title at the Texaco Women's
Challenger event in Edinburgh yesterday.
The No.6 seed, who knocked out Britain's Sam Smith in the semi-finals, overcame
unseeded Russian Julia Lutrova 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, in a two-and-a-half-hour
marathon. Lutrova, coached by former British internationalist Nick Fulwood,
fought back from a set and 3-1 down to lead 5-4 in the final set before
Noorlander reeled off the next three games.
Lutrova gained some consolation in the doubles final, where she partnered
Britain's Jane Wood to a 7-6, 6-4 victory over British national champions
Shirli-Ann Siddall and Mandy Wainwright.
q BORIS Becker took the ATP Tour world championship for the third time
yesterday with a 7-6, 6-0, 7-6 victory over Michael Chang in Frankfurt.
It was Becker's first major triumph since he won this title in 1992. The
championship, contested only by the world's top 16 players, is regarded as the
most prestigious outside the four grand-slam events.
q BRITISH No.2 Tim Henman maintained his rise up the world ladder by clinching
a third title in four weeks with victory at the ATP Challenger event on Reunion
Island, Mauritius, yesterday.
The 21-year-old Oxford star beat Germany's Patrick Baur 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 in the
final, adding to his wins at the ATP Challenger in Seoul and the British
national tournament in Telford. The world No.111 could find himself in the top
100 for the first time today.
q WORLD No.1 Steffi Graf battled fellow German Anke Huber in a thrilling
five-setter at the WTA Tour Championships in New York yesterday. The all-German
final produced a match that had the fans at Madison Square Garden on their feet
cheering Graf's 6-1, 2-6, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 victory after a two-hour and 46-minute
war. It was her ninth title of the year.

<HEADLINE>Ill wind for the crofters of Tiree</HEADLINE>

THE winds of change are this winter blowing harder than ever across Tiree's
fertile pasture land, leaving in their wake the makings of a major conflict
between the remote Inner Hebridean island's two main industries - agriculture
and tourism.
And it is a battle which looks set to have few clear winners as crofters find
themselves embroiled in a land-use struggle with some ``unscrupulous''
afficionados of the growing industry surrounding windsurfing.
For Tiree is now recognised as Britain's premier windsurfing venue as more and
more devotees flock to the small island each year in search of guaranteed wind,
wave and cheap holidays.
The trend towards ``mono-tourism'' began some 10 years ago when visiting
surfers organised the first Wave Classic national championships on Tiree - a
week-long event which sees hundreds of participants and followers making an
annual winter pilgrimage to the island.
But initial hopes that the sport would provide a much-needed and welcome boost
to local coffers have, according to one local farmer, simply not happened.
Angus Lamont, who tenants one of the island's five main farms at Croish on the
north shore, is severely disenchanted with surfers and would be delighted if he
never saw another wetsuit as long as he lives.
Lamont has had a few run-ins with surfers over access through his land to
beaches, one of which led the surfers, somewhat ironically, to call in the
local police.
The incident happened after Lamont padlocked a gate to the beach, inspiring his
protagonists to seek the help of the island's single-handed bobby, PC Danny
Lapsley.
Lapsley explained that common grazings was not the same as common land, as
surfers thought, and gave them no right of way.
ANGUS LAMONT feels that the incident was symptomatic of the ``economic blight''
he feels the sport is set to wreak on the island's agricultural economy. For he
claims that surfers' vehicles are destroying the beachheads, accelerating
wind-swept erosion and ``turning fertile pasture into a desert''.
He recalled how his grandfather, with only a horse and cart and a strong pair
of arms'' reclaimed former sand dunes and turned them into the farm he now
tends.
And he feels that windsurfing can only reverse that recovery.
``The very wind that is bringing them here in the first place will be our
eventual economic downfall if we allow them to ride roughshod over us with
their four-wheel drives,'' he claimed.
Lamont's views are not isolated within the crofting community. Other crofters
told how their fences had been driven through and gates left open with little
or no regard for livestock.
Outwith the farming community, feelings towards the sport are mixed, with some
claiming that it brings in extra cash and others saying that the benefits are
few.
The island's two foodstores say that takings are up thanks to windsurfers,
while the two local hoteliers - whom one would most expect to benefit - hold
opposing views on surfing's merits.
Tiree Lodge Hotel broadly welcomes the sport while the Scarinish Hotel claims
it brings little extra cash at all.
Lamont says that only those with holiday properties to let - specifically
absentee landlords - see any major benefit, claiming that most surfers bring
their own supplies from cheaper mainland stores.
The issue is sufficiently disturbing to prompt local factor and councillor Ian
Gillies in his column in the community's fortnightly newsletter An Tirisdeach
to voice ``grave concern about environmental damage and four-wheel drive
vehicles in particular. But no solution is offered in the article, and therein
lies the dilemma.
Gillies, who manages the island estate for the Duke of Argyll, is somewhat
ambivalent towards windsurfing but feels that the island should not be steered
away from more traditional, higher-paying tourism.
``This is a fragile economy,'' he warned, ``and we will have to be very careful
how we proceed.''

IT happened when we were nearly there. I moved in an awkward way and wrenched
my back. Panic . . . The plan for the week had been strenuous walking in the
mountains that surround the beautiful high, alpine valley of Lech, and have
made this small community one of the earliest and most famous of Austria's ski
resorts.
Though ordinary walking was still relatively easy, there was no chance that I
would be able to tackle the rougher patches, and certainly not anything that
meant scrambling or climbing. The chairlifts and cable cars are numerous enough
to indicate that over 100,000 come to this 1000-strong community for winter
skiing, and would make getting up a mountain possible. But how would I get down
on foot, when even a walk downstairs had me wincing? Worst of all, I would be
holding back the rest of the party. Then came the great idea. Why not turn the
disadvantage into an asset? Why not find out what Lech had to offer in addition
to being energetic on the mountains on foot or on mountain bikes?
First came Sunday morning, with local wind bands, playing around 9.30am on the
open square beside the church. There were crowds on their way to church, and
national dress on view for this tuneful gathering, near enough the Romantik
Hotel Krone to ensure we did not oversleep. But, with air so clear, and the sun
appearing suddenly, like a torch flashing over the top of the mountains, who
would want to waste time staying in bed?
The Hotel Krone, like all the Lech hotels is family owned, a hotel for some 200
years, growing gradually into three linked buildings. For five generations, the
Pfefferkorn family has owned and run this charming hotel. With its wooden,
shingle walls, green shutters and great tubs of flowers, it is a typical valley
building.
Inside, the dining rooms in particular are still furnished in a comfortable
traditional style with more fine, old furniture throughout the hotel. Lech
hoteliers were early aware that anonymous, modern buildings would be
incongruous in this setting, with the Lech river running hazy glacier white
through the centre, at the start of its long journey, so, they have kept their
old styles but included every comfort inside.
Summer hay-cutting has the dual purpose of providing food for the animals and
help for the snow to stay firm on the slopes, and it is fascinating to realise
how well summer farming and winter skiing combine to bring prosperity to this
once poor valley. Yet, even before the post-war ski boom, since the beginning
of the century tourism and summer farming have left an atmosphere of the
pre-war writers who travelled romantically through these Austrian mountains and
valleys.
Looking at the outside of the old church, the Alter Krone (court house), the
old school, and many other buildings, I had the sudden, teasing thought that I
had seen these painted wall decorations somewhere before. Then, I remembered.
They were very like the scraffiti which simulate doors and beautifully decorate
buildings in parts of Switzerland, and that was a clue to the past.
The people of Lech reached this alpine valley from the Valais region, in the
great Walser treks from what is now Switzerland in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries. At that time the area was covered in trees. Even today,
considering that the valley stands at 1450 metres, the trees are beautiful.
Lech has a scheme of ``plant a tree'' for summer visitors, who return so
regularly that some even merit a Diamond Pin of Honour for 45 years of coming
back. Even more have Silver Pins for 10 years.
With my first sight-seeing over, the pleasure was to sit at one of the dozens
of pavement and riverside cafes for a coffee and apfel strudel. But I had come
to Lech for the mountains and, aching back or no, I was going to get there. It
was only five minutes to the nearest chairlift, the Schlegeltopf Lifts, and a
wonderful 15 minutes later, with the valley dropping away below, the lift
deposited me gently on the top platform.
Ahead, people in shorts and boots, clutching the inevitable alpenstocks, and
small backpacks, were setting off on tracks and over the rocks, but I found a
small, secret cleft in the mountainside, not far from the lift, and settled
down close to a little burn below the level of the low bushes. I was near
enough the path to hear the voices of men and women, and many children, but
felt a hundred miles away.
With everyone ready for every meal, the food in Lech is excellent with no
thought of a slimming diet after all that exercise. The Krone is well known for
food - one morning, the Pfefferkorns even gave us an outdoor champagne
breakfast, near the hotel's alpine hut. There are many other hotels and small
inns, once used by travellers making their slow way through the mountains. But
the place where local people eat is the old Bodenalpe, not far from the centre
of Lech. It specialises in Lech dishes.
Could it have been this good food or something in the Lech air that a day or
two later had me feeling fitter and bolder once more when I boarded the hiking
bus in the centre of Lech? It leaves hourly all day for the Spullersee (lake)
some 30 minutes up the Spullertal toll road. In winter the road is closed and
disappears under many feet of snow, ideal for cross-country skiing. (In summer
it is open to private cars before 9.30am and later in the afternoon, which
means a day-expedition for early birds.)
The bus goes all day. Once there, I decided to tackle a walk round the lake,
spurred on by the sight of a marmot, a delightful, small, ancient-looking
creature enjoying the morning sun on the top of the wall of an old dam.
Luckily, I tackled the difficult part first, scrambling warily across the
mountain slope above the lake. It was beautiful, shaped a bit like a tadpole
with a long tail, and a flat path on the far side.
Triumphantly, I reached the path and completed the circle. In the way of
mountain walking, it was longer than it had first seemed but I made it. Next
time, I promised myself, I would be on top of the mountains.

THE other week was not an especially good one for former SFA secretary Ernie
Walker as Scotland's teams were humbled in Europe yet again.
Once again Walker, in his new role as the man in charge of the soccer think
tank which was recently set up to examine the state of our national game, found
himself being blamed for the defeats.
It mattered little to his critics - in the media and on the phone-in lines to
radio stations - that Walker's work did not begin until September. It mattered
even less to some that Walker and his colleagues are already seeing progress
being made and, indeed, have found an audience in the game receptive to their
ideas.
Walker may have been hurt by some of the criticism he has had to face but, in
the main, he simply found it difficult to understand why he was being blamed
for our clubs' European failures.
``It is hard to see just how people can arrive at the conclusion that the blame
for the European results should be laid at my door,'' he smiles. ``We started
to work on the problems of the game on September 1. Are there people out there
who think I was simply going to wave some kind of magic wand and suddenly all
the ills of our game would vanish?
``Quite plainly, that is nonsense, and I don't even want to address any of the
points which these people were making the other week. We have been asked to
draw up a report on the state of the Scottish game and make suggestions about
how changes in organisation and structure may bring about improvements.
``There is no quick fix. There is no simple solution, and I am not about to
produce some easy answers to please those people who are complaining but which
will not get to the roots of the game's problems.''
What has especially pleased Walker is the response from the managers across the
country to the initiatives which have been suggested by Dutchman Rinus Michels,
who is in charge of the technical aspects being covered by the think tank.
Says Walker: ``Rinus has spoken to the managers and they recognised that they
were listening to one of the major figures in world football. He is the father
of modern Dutch football, the man who set up the Ajax youth system and who was
also in charge of the national side in their great days.
``He maintains that the problem we have with youngsters is having to replace
street football. No-one plays on the streets any more. When we were at school
you kicked a ball around the streets for hours on end. You can't do that now
and Rinus says we must replace that.
``He believes in having four-a-side games for six, seven, and eight-year-olds,
then working up to seven-a-side games for other age groups before allowing any
of them to play in a full game.
``I have heard that Alex Miller is already starting sessions for six-year-olds.
In these four-a-side matches the young lads are given the chance to feel
comfortable with the ball and simply learn the skills with the minimum of
supervision.
``Now, we know that every schoolboy at six will not go right through the system
and turn into a star. There has to be a process of weeding out those who are
not so good and while that can cause some problems, Rinus has explained that
the boys who come to Ajax, and their parents, recognise that they cannot all
play for the first team.
``All the premier division managers were at one of the meetings with Rinus and
all of them are ready to use some of the ideas, if not all of them. Clubs have
to be prepared to invest in youth programmes, because it is only by educating
young players that we will begin to produce major talents again.''
Another problem may be the playing environment these fresh young talents then
find themselves in. While the premier division is not within his current remit,
Walker did have interesting views regarding the Top Ten.
``I do believe that when the premier division was first formed it saved
Scottish football at that time,'' he pointed out. ``Yet it may be that playing
each other four times has not been good, and the fear factor, because of the
relegation situation, has brought too much tension into the game.
``Whenever I think of a premier division match I have an immediate vision of a
manager's face screwed up in anger as he rants at players. Is this really a
game to enjoy? It should be. But is this terror, this kind of driven football,
what we really want? I doubt that.
``There is a suggestion from UEFA to limit each league to just 30 games per
season, allowing more room for European matches. Anyone who does not see that
European games will become more frequent is naive. If the president of Real
Madrid and the president of Bayern Munich see their teams play each other in
front of massive crowds, with huge television fees and massive advertising all
generating great amounts of money, don't you think they'll be saying to each
other, `Let's do this more often.' Of course, they will.
``There will be more European games and changing our league may be a way to
raise the standards of our game.''
In the meantime, we are left with the survival tactics which are helping
destroy the game and these will be in place for some time yet.
Walker cannot do much about the current trends. Any success his initiatives
will enjoy will come in the future. For the moment, unfortunately, he will be
forced to accept the brickbats he thought he had left behind him when he left
the SFA.
He grins: ``Going around the world for FIFA and UEFA you forget about the kind
of criticism you have to put up with at home. You just don't face that type of
abuse.
``However, this job has to be done, and at the end of our three-year spell, I
would hope that some of our ideas will be in place and that somewhere down the
line we will again be producing players who can match the best in the world.
``But a lot of education is necessary before that happens.''

THE famine relief has arrived at last. The sprayer is away at the blacksmith's
being strengthened so I can't get on with the spraying the rape, and Potions,
the chemist who likes to come and play, is plastering the setaside with slurry.
All is well, and the Farmer is hiding in the house.
But how can he do that, I hear you ask? What about the Breadwinner? Will she
not kick the Farmer outside to sweep the close or wash her car? After all,
she's retired is she not and the Farmer is no longer the master of his own
house - even during the day.
Well, there is good news on that front. The Breadwinner has come out of
retirement and gone back to what she does best. She is winning bread again in
Aberdeen. The cash flow is benefiting but so is the Farmer's lot.
The breakfast has been extended by half-an-hour, the coffee break is back up
from its traditional seven-and-a-half minutes to half-an-hour and the
after-lunch nap is back on the agenda though, as he is rather out of the habit,
the Farmer is having a job getting back into that. Now that watching the test
matches is again possible, the cricket season is being looked forward to
eagerly.
Of course, the place is becoming a tip again and the books are becoming
confused, but you can't be perfect all the time.
When I look at the piles of leaves in the close, the broken guttering in the
Dutch barn and the obvious need for strengthening and slating all the roofs of
the old steading, it seems like my three and a bit years to retirement are a
long time.
And yet retirement scares me. I won't be able to be like Frank Sinatra, George
Foreman or the Breadwinner and come back whenever like. When I retire the elder
Investment and her husband come in here and the Breadwinner and I are off to
the death house. It is a one-way ticket.
It has been a depressing job and, for the moment at least, we have given up the
search for a death house.
The houses on the market are all too dear. And after living in this
18th-century farmhouse it seems just too big a jump into a modern kit house,
for all the comfort they offer. I don't think I will ever be at home where I
can't hear the plaster rattling down the interiors of the walls.
Quite the nicest houses we've looked at have been the steadings that have been
converted. It is amazing how the buildings our forefathers put up for our
cattle and horses have so much pleasanter lines and are made of so much more
douce materials than those they built for themselves. But the trouble with
those steadings is that they are right beside the farmhouse.
What we would really like is a 19th-century steading where the house had been
burned down or bombed. The Breadwinner and the Farmer were contemplating that
one day when the Farmer had a stroke of genius or madness. Perhaps it was both.
We could build a steading on the farm and then convert it to a death house. It
would be built as my great-great grandfather built the Little Ardo steading; of
stone-gatherings - and it would be roofed with real slates. It would have
beautiful arched cartshed doors, little loft doors to convert to windows and it
would be exactly the right size for conversion. It would not, like so many new
houses in the countryside, stick out like a sore thumb.
And that is exactly what we propose to do.
Of course we won't build it and convert it on-site. We'll do the conversion on
the drawing board and build our death house already converted. The planning
application is in, the soakaway hole is dug and we wait with bated breath the
decision of the planners.
The double garage is planned but what about that other mode of transport? It is
while since I gave you an update on the Farmer's quest for an Olympic gold
medal for cycling.
My natural modesty allows me to report a great improvement. From being faraway
last in the ten-mile time trials I am now in the competition.
Most of the improvement is in know-how and equipment.
It is no co-incidence that cycling champions don't turn up in old trousers,
tackety boots and bicycle clips. You need shoes that tie on to the pedals so
that you can pull the pedals up as well as pushing them down. And those
execrable shorts are not just advertising - they really do help streamline even
the Farmer's figure. The old fisherman's sweater was far too heavy and grabbed
too much air. It has been replaced by a skin-tight rubbery film in the club
colours.
Remember my first open race when I was accused of cheating? I was 50 seconds
late for the start which allowed me to win the booby prize of #7 despite my
time of 33 minutes.
And I was in the money again in my second race. Determined to be on time, I was
minutes early at the start but with six seconds of the countdown left I
remembered that I still had my hooded track-suit top on. I struggled to get it
off but it stuck fast on my helmet. Eventually I got the hat off, the jersey
off and the hat back on, and set off 30 seconds late.
The terror of being branded a cheat for a second time put a tremendous spurt of
speed down to the ageing leggies. I came home in 27 minutes and got second
prize. And to think that if I hadn't lost that 30 seconds at the start, I would
probably have been last.

MYER LACOME, former principal of Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art, Dundee,
has spent the past four years travelling Europe, a trip that began with a need
to find out what had happened to his family during the Holocaust and the
earlier Pogroms, but which became both an intense wish to record those events,
and the desire to provide a memorial for the victims. The result - the
exhibition The Holocaust and After? at Moray House, Edinburgh - is both a
moving history of that time but also addresses events today.
The show is in three parts, the first mostly in charcoal drawing depicting the
Jewish community before the war, and then moving into the coming of Nazism and
its effect on Jewish people throughout Europe. The influence of music features
heavily, with the recurring image of the ``Kletzmer'' musician, wandering
players who travel the countryside playing both religious and folk music. In
one corner stands an installation of music stand, violin and case, chair and
jacket with yellow star, the whole piece overwhelmed with fallen leaves.
The second part chose not only the horrors of concentration camps but, with
depictions of Bosnia, that ethnic cleansing continues today. Memorials to the
death camps are bright collages planted with sharp reminders of the humanity
who died - parts of letters, barbed wire and human silhouettes. Most poignant
of all, is the tiny installation to the one and a half million children who
died - a doll, a pair of shoes, a butterfly - there for the children of
Theresienstait.
The last panels, colourful striped collages, represent the 12 months of the
year and signify the artist's personal hope for the future. Two designs for
Holocaust Memorial Tapestries are Lacome's own suggestions for the memorial
that he feels Scotland should provide, to honour past victims and those who are
still dying. He has contacted both the arts council and the National Lottery,
feeling that the time is now right to introduce a Memorial Bursary for the
Creative Arts, not particularly for painting alone but for all art forms. Here,
he feels, would be a positive step that would benefit young people.
This is not an exhibition aimed at the art community. It is too personal for
that. Neither is it political humanitarian art. This is art about people,
emotional and thought-provoking. Its powerful effect can be measured in the
many comments in the visitors book, the personal stories that the artist has
heard, and in its use at the text for the Remembrance Sunday sermon at the
local church.
Scotland Street School, where it transfers next April, plan to produce packs
for use by school groups, and expect heavy interest. Lacome perhaps best sums
up the effect of his show, ``I have come out of it knowing a lot more about
human relationships. It has been good for me. I understand myself better; a
very selfish thing to say I know, but it is a positive thing.''
n.The Holocaust and After? runs until November 24. Transferring to Scotland
Street School April 6 to May 19, 1996.

Holocaust and modern-day events of atrocity and hope

Sports chain
in crisis
SEARS is thought to be on the verge of cutting its losses in its Olympus sports
chain and selling the business after to stem the losses.
Drastic action is needed if Sears is to revive the group's fortunes. Interim
profits plunged 28% with Olympus making a loss of #5.8m after taking into
account the costs associated with closing 24 branches and discounting excess
stock.
Pension votes
PENSION fund trustees are being urged to vote on all issues at company Annual
and Extraordinary General Meetings. In a briefing for its members, the National
Association of Pension Funds, says voting should be recognised as both a
shareholders' responsibility and an opportunity to improve corporate
governance.
Growth survey
THE economy is slowing to a more sustainable rate of growth and does not need
the stimulus of lower interest rates to prevent a slide into recession, a top
economic think-tank said today.
There was an outside chance that the recent rash of gloomy indicators showing
falling retail sales and house prices and sluggish manufacturing output could
herald a period of stagnation, the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research said.

A TRIO of Scots cyclists will become a familiar sight on the planned UK network
of cycle tracks.
Mr Patrick Blashill, Mr Steve Barrett and Mr David Barbour will cover the
entire 6500 miles of the routes being created by Sustrans with the help of cash
from the National Lottery's Millennium Fund.
However, unlike other cyclists using the routes, it will not be all fun for the
three cyclists - they will be using their pedal power to map every route.
Their company Stirling Surveys has won the contract to provide maps of the
planned cycle route around Britain.
Stirling Surveys has already published its first cycle route map, the
sea-to-sea route from Whitehaven or Workington to Sunderland or Newcastle.
``Sustrans was already working on the project,'' said Mr Blashill, ``before it
was awarded the lottery money which will allow it to speed up the work.''
It is hoped that 2000 miles of the cycle routes will be completed by the year
2000, and 5000 miles by the year 2005.
Stirling Surveys is delighted by the success of the first map which has already
sold more than 5000 copies.
``We are now working on the route from Inverness to Dover, and one across
Wales,'' said Mr Barrett.
The Sustrans project is the biggest single contract Stirling Surveys has won
since Patrick Blashill and Steve Barrett went into partnership in 1987.
Their first title was strip maps of the West Highland Way which they published
under the Footprint label.
``There are now 14 titles in our walking map series,'' said Mr Barrett, ``but
the most successful is the West Highland Way which has sold 30,000.''
Stirling Surveys also specialises in producing maps for orienteers, and last
year it produced the maps used in the World Veterans Orienteering Championships
at Aviemore.
``We published 4000 maps for that event,'' said Mr Blashill, ``and we have been
to Minnesota where the 1997 championship is being held to survey the area
before drawing the maps.''
During this trip, the Scots cartographers stumbled across black bears on
several occasions, but as Mr Blashill explained: ``Luckily they are not used to
humans and ran off.''
To complete their walking, orienteering and cycle maps the three partners
survey the areas themselves, but this is not a problem as all three participate
in these pastimes.
``If we didn't,'' laughed Mr Barbour, ``we might have difficulties surveying
6500 miles of cycle track.''

Great Portland
A SELL at 165p, according to sector analysts as UBS. They say it is typical of
many of the larger property companies and provides a good illustration as to
why they have for so long taken such a negative view of the prospective
relative performance of the quoted property sector.
It is a well-run and well-financed company, and with some help from a fall in
property yields, its net asset value/share could rise by 7% plus per annum on
average over the next couple of year. However, it has a poor reversionary
profile, and a good proportion of the leases on its Central London office
properties is due to expire between now and the year 2000.
The company is, therefore, likely to show little, if any, earnings per share
growth and no dividend growth over the next three years,
Sears
THE retail group whose outlets include Shoe Express, Olympus and Wallis, has
been the subject of several downgrades recently. The latest being from
Warburg's retail analysts who now expect Sears to make #124m this year compared
with earlier expectations for profits of #132m.
Next year's profit forecast has also been pared back with #149m pencilled in
compared with #163m previously. Poor third-quarter trading at British Shoe and
problems in womenswear, particularly Miss Selfridge, are to blame for the
downgradings.
ScottishPower
UNLIKE the English generating companies, Scottish Power combines the roles of
generator and distributor; it is also able to export electricity south of the
Border, and will soon add Northern Ireland to its export base.
However, there have been some fears about the company's ability to maintain
profit and dividend growth as a result of the loss in generation profits from
the new generation pricing formula.
Thus, Henderson Crosthwaite believes that the bid for Manweb is particularly
timely in providing an earnings boost. The purchase will provide ScottishPower,
already the UK's lowest-cost distributor, with scope for further cost
reductions. It is estimated that it will be able to remove #30m of cost from
Manweb by 1997 and #80m by 2000.
Royal Insurance
SELL, says Merrill Lynch, at 389p (presently 382p). Royal is doing its best to
maintain attention on its North American operations although the brokers
suspect that the bulk of earnings potential is now well recognised by the stock
market.
The UK downturn is gaining momentum. Claims experience has been very favourable
but there are now signs of a deterioration on the back of more normal weather
and subsidence claims. Therefore it is expected that earnings will deteriorate
very sharply over the next three years.
However, with the current speculative interest in the financial sector, the
downside in the short term is limited by the discount to net asset value which
is estimated to be around 397p by the year-end.
Bruntcliffe
ALBERT E Sharp reckons the shares a buy at 17p. Even by the standards of the
beleaguered building materials sector, Bruntcliffe Aggregates has had a
difficult year with the shares falling by 40% since the March preliminaries.
The interim results were also about 25% lower because of weather and economic
factors outside the group's control. But conditions are beginning to stabilise
and there is no major exposure to risk of further UK road cutbacks.
The 1996 forecast is of pre-tax profits up from #1.85m to #2.20m and the
prospective yield of 9.2% rising to 9.9%. With the longer-term prospect of
earnings enhancing acquisitions as the group pursues its expansionist
ambitions, the shares look substantially undervalued.
BOC
HENDERSON Crosthwaite recommends buying BOC, currently at 903p.
BOC's principal businesses are industrial gases, healthcare products and
services and vacuum technology and distribution of which gases provide the bulk
of group revenue. Thus the onus is on gases to provide growth and indeed this
is happening according to recently published annual results. Consumption of
gases traditionally grows at about 1.5 times GDP growth.
Having turned around its US operations which previously produced unsatisfactory
returns, BOC is expected to improve the overall return through a mixture of
innovation, productivity growth and better global identity under thepresent
management team.

<HEADLINE>Chief executive may resign this week Battle hots up at Cable as Young decides to stay</HEADLINE>

LORD Young's decision to stay on in his post as executive chairman of Cable &amp;
Wireless (C &amp; W) until February 1997, has brought a simmering boardroom battle
to a head.
Chief executive James Ross is believed to be particularly concerned by Lord
Young's decision and could announce his resignation this week. Several senior
executives at the UK telecommunications group have requested a meeting with the
non-executive directors to air their concerns.
Mr Win Bishoff, the well-regarded chairman of merchant bank Schroder, is likely
to play a key role in refereeing the boardroom battle. Mr Bishoff is deputy
chairman of C &amp; W and chairman of the remuneration commitee.
This latest episode in the C &amp; W saga is not a surprise, given the difficult
year which the group has faced. Investors and some inside the company have
become increasingly concerned about the group's strategy and poor return on
investment.
The high profile withdrawl from payphones in the UK has been accompanied by
resignations of senior staff most notably Mr Duncan Lewis, former chief
executive of Mercury Communications, after only nine months in the post.
It appears unclear who is most to blame for the company's drift, Lord Young or
Mr Ross.
Lord Young, the former Tory Cabinet Minister, has a reputation for being
difficult to work with, but is seen as a good political operator, something
which is handy in opening doors and doing business in the highly regulated
telecommunications industry.
He was responsible for the UK Government's telecommunications policy whilst at
the Department of Trade and Industry.
Whilst there are operational problems the core of the C &amp; W business, it has
considerable value and has often been ahead of its rivals in seeing which way
the telecoms wind was blowing in terms of new market opportunities.
The difficulty has been in charting a course to best take advanatge of these
opportunities.
C &amp; W already has a global reach, something which is increasingly vital for any
telecommunications company wishing to succeed in competitive global markets. It
has operations in 50 countries, employs 41,000 people, and had sales of #5000m
last year.
It has an excellent foothold in the Far East through its Hong Kong Telecom
subsidiary. This provides it with the gateway to some of the world's fastest
growing economies such as China.
The perceived lack of a coherent strategy and management problems, has led
Cable &amp; Wireless' shares to underperform. There is a gap of between 25% and 50%
between the value of the company and its stockmarket capitalisation.
As such investors can take comfort from the fact that there appears to be
little scope for the shares to drop much further.
Indeed the low valuation of C &amp; W has brought it to the attention of potential
predators most notably British Telecom. It would be ironic if C &amp; W was
eventually swallowed up by its larger UK rival.

WITH the outlook for inflation improving, the CBI's monthly trends inquiry, due
to be published early on Friday, will be closely studied for its findings on
manufacturers' price expectations.
January is the main month of the year for manufacturers to post price increases
and the CBI's November survey should begin to pick these up.
Last week figures on producer and retail prices for October were better than
expected and encouraged hopes that inflation could be close to its peak.
The output, income, and expenditure figures for the third quarter, due today,
are expected to confirm the continued slowdown in activity.
The CSO's first stab at Q3 GDP suggested growth of 0.5% in the quarter for a
year-on-year rate of 2.4%. This is expected to remain unchanged unless there
are revisions to the data for services.
However, non-oil GDP could be revised down from 0.5% to 0.4% and the
year-on-year rate from 2.4% to 2.3% to take account of the weakness of
manufacturing output.
The figures will give estimates of consumer expenditure, which grew at 0.8% in
the second quarter, well ahead of lack-lustre retail sales.
Also due today are Bank of England figures for the broad M4 measure of the
money supply for last month. James Capel analysts are forecasting growth of
0.2% taking the annual rate up from 8.2% to 8.5%. M4 lending is expected to
drop back from #4000m to around #3500m.
TODAY - Output, income, and expenditure (Third quarter); money supply.
TOMORROW - Non-EU trade (October).
WEDNESDAY - None announced.
THURSDAY - None annouced.
FRIDAY - CBI monthly trends (November).

QUALITY was the ``in'' word for Scottish meat producers last week. Beef
producers attending the Beef 2000 conference at Inverurie were exhorted to work
towards the specialist branded market rather than the mass commodity markets.
The British Texel Sheep Society has the same sort of idea. Guests at their 21st
anniversary conference at Peebles were entertained with the prospect of
``tender and tasty Texel lamb'' ranking alongside such top-branded products as
Aberdeen-Angus beef, Speyside malt whisky and Loch Fyne oysters.
Within 12 months they hope to hear discerning housewives asking for Texel lamb
by name. All of this depends on the success of a Texel marketing scheme based
on the successful Aberdeen-Angus promotion.
Aberdeen-Angus Producers' Jim Ironside told the Texel breeders of his
conviction that it is simply a matter of time before all meats are sold under
brand names.
Stewart Macphie of Glenbervie, near Stonehaven, has also been busy blowing the
trumpet, waving the flag and beating the drum on behalf of Aberdeen-Angus - and
encouraging his fellow producers to cash in on the breed's reputation for
quality by concentrating on the top end of the market.
He is in a position to do things in a big way and within three years has
established a pedigree herd, run on a commercial basis, with four good bulls
and 200 breeding cows. He is also building a specialist butchery unit, adjacent
to the home farm, which will handle all his own production and any bought-in
stock - none of it less than 75% Aberdeen-Angus. It helps when you can count
Egon Ronay as a friend and enlist his advice as to which leading chefs in
Britain should be allowed to buy your beef. If you happen to know the chairman
of the Savoy Hotels group, that too can ease your penetration of the premium
market.
If the chairman of the Savoy group also went to the same school and is the
former British ambassador in Paris there is a fair chance that he will have
contacts in the right quarters in that city. One of Stewart Macphie's beliefs,
he cheerfully admits, is that you should never be afraid to milk your friends
for all they are worth.
Obviously not every Aberdeen-Angus producer will have contacts at that level.
Some are in a small way of business, with half-a-dozen animals. However, if the
brand name is being properly marketed they can benefit along with the big boys.
Stewart Macphie is strong on marketing: ``How anyone thinks you can compare a
seven-year-old Holstein hag with a 22-month Aberdeen-Angus off the grass field
is incomprehensible to me,'' he says. ``It shows a staggering ineptitude in
marketing.''
Doubtless, the Aberdeen-Angus love the grass and clover but perhaps they are
being deprived. In France the Dufraisse family in the Dordogne has for five
generations been feeding its Limousins and Blond d'Acquitaines on beer. Their
daily pint is reckoned to act as an aperitif and give them an appetite. The
pampered beasts also get a daily massage. The result is said to be well-marbled
beef - one of the great attributes of the Aberdeen-Angus.
If we are to compete on the international market maybe it is time our home bred
cattle were getting a daily dram - blends for the lower end of the market and
best malts for the high-fliers.
The quality message was also being hammered home by Scottish Agricultural
College senior economist Stuart Ashworth in his address to the Beef 2000
conference. Like it or not, he said, in our main export markets beef was still
stuck in the commodity sector and was therefore susceptible to currency
fluctuations. ``The more we can move away from that and become identified as a
high-value product the better it will be for us in these export markets.''
While there has been a remarkable growth in beef exports from the UK there has
been a decline in home consumption. This may be down to a number of factors,
including the impact of BSE scares, but as Stuart Ashworth pointed out, there
are a number of other considerations, including price comparisons with white
meat, changing lifestyles and the competition from convenience foods.
Stewart Macphie's view is that the decline in beef consumption can be quite
simply explained - it does not taste as good as it used to. That is a failing
which is not peculiar to beef, he argues. ``Bread reached the stage where it
was inedible. A few years ago you could not eat British ice-cream. It appeared
that Lyons and Walls were in competition to make it totally inedible.''
Much of the blame, he suggests, can be laid at the door of the powerful
supermarket chains and their determination to drive prices down. However, he is
confident that the time has come for a big change and the consumer is rebelling
and demanding better quality.
That assertion comes from a man who modestly declares that he regards himself
as neither a farmer nor a breeder but ``a bloody good consumer''. Now there is
an epitaph I might claim for myself.
Lunch at Glenbervie House included ``sampler'' portions of lasagne and
stroganoff for a starter followed by a small individual steak and kidney pie of
the kind which Macphie's hope to be marketing soon.
The coup de grace was thick slices of Aberdeen-Angus beef, carved from a 24lb
roast accompanied by roast potatoes and brussels sprouts. As a well-brought-up
lad, I left a clean plate every time.

Forth Valley picks youthful chairman
YOUNG blood is beginning to course through the veins of Local Enterprise
Companies.
Seven months have passed since the powerful Commons Scottish Affairs Committee
sought reforms, including the replacement of Lec directors with ``young, active
people'' to ensure the companies do not stagnate.
Forth Valley Enterprise has now appointed the youngest chairman, by far, within
the 13-strong Scottish Enterprise network - 31-years-old Mike Cantlay.
However, he believes youth is not the issue, even if his appointment means that
public perceptions of a system prejudiced towards ``the old, great and good''
no longer ring true.
Mr Cantlay is adamant that the only issue which matters is that Lecs deliver
the declared objective of economic regeneration.
His performance during an interview following his appointment suggests an old
head on young shoulders, and that he will not suffer fools within the
organisation as he pushes to build on Forth Valley's earlier successes.
He also answered criticisms by the Scottish Affairs Commitee that Lecs are
secretive, self-appointed cliques who often indulge in ``kite-flying
exercises'' which inflate the worth of projects.
Indeed, Mr Cantley went further - insisting there should be little, if any,
restructuring of the Lecs system.
In a blunt reaction to the five-month inquiry, which followed The Herald
publishing extensive details of directors' interests in contracts and grants
awared by the Lecs, he emphasised:
q.Anyone who considers becoming a Forth Valley board member to obtain cash for
their own business is ``nuts''.
q.His board will be as open and as publicly-accountable as possible.
q.Each and every opportunity to make Forth Valley an ideal location to invest
in, work and live, will be grasped.
Mr Cantlay, who lives in Callander, is managing director of the Hector Russell
kiltmaker group, which employs 300 people at a factory in Inverness and a
string of shops throughout Scotland.
A Master of Business Administration, he is a former Young Manager of the Year
in the Scottish Thistle tourist awards, and a past chairman of the Rural
Stirling Economic Partnership and the Scottish Tourist Trade Association.
He has also been involved in such diverse organisations as the Loch Lomond,
Stirling and Trossachs Tourist Board, the Stirling District Plan Group, and
Forth Valley Education Business Partnership.
Mr Cantlay, a self-styled progressive, joined Forth Valley Enterprise last year
as vice-chairman - and succeeds Mr Robbie Taylor, who steps down from the
unpaid, part-time post after three years at the helm.
He conceded his appointment was made internally, and that Lecs remain
self-perpetuating. However, he feared outside placements on boards would cause
conflicts of interest.
It was also important that places went to people with particular skills to meet
needs, and he added: ``It would be a great shame if there was interference,
political or otherwise, in the structure. It is maturing, and will get better
as our confidence grows.''
Mr Cantlay claimed that many concerns about the system were unjustified, given
the scrutiny the network faces from numerous parties. He added: ``I will
encourage openness - we have a lot of good songs to sing, and we need to sing
about them.
``I am aware of the responsibility. The work of Lecs affects many people in
different walks of life, and we need to ensure everyone knows what is going
on.''
Mr Cantlay, in charge of a #23m budget, will seek partnerships with anyone
willing to see the Lec fulfil potential. He believes that, following local
government reform, the Lec will occupy an increasingly important role in
ensuring the success of the local economy.
No targets have been set, other than to ensure the Lec becomes more relevant
and accessible: ``My role is to make things happen, to make sure partnerships
work, and to motivate staff and others to make this company function even
better than in the past.
``That is the real challenge. It is easier to make an organisation work, when
it is not functioning well, than to improve one that is already in good shape.''
He concluded: ``Come back in a year or two, and see if I have built on the
solid foundation here. I am confident we will meet the challenges.''

Clare Henry examines an exhibition which proves painting still has a place in
this hi-tech era
ONCE upon a time, not long ago, painting was still taken for granted. Kids used
poster colour; real artists used oils. As internationalist Julie Roberts says:
``Painting is a sumptuous thing to do; a beautiful and physical activity.''
Unfortunately in this post-modern, cool, conceptual age of hi-tech with its
objective, hands-off ethos, messing about with traditional materials like
canvas, brush, turps and paint is fashionably looked down on in avant garde
circles.
Throwing the baby out with the bath water is always wrongheaded. Electronic
imaging, installation, video et al, do not mean the death of paint, pencils or
paper. One doesn't preclude the other. You can use both. They need each other.
This parable is difficult to get across. So too the fact that there's
absolutely no need to denigrate one person or style in order to praise the
other. Peter Howson's success with figuratio does not mean Douglas Gordon's
video installation failure. Scotland is proud of both. Pluralism should be the
name of the 1990s game - and the 1980s/1990s them/us antagonism is juvenile and
self-defeating.
So to the CCA's new show, Persistence Of Painting. Persistence is an
unfortunate word, redolent of trying too hard; fighting for survival. The title
is almost an apology: thou doth protest too much, me thinks.
The disappointing thing about the Persistence of Painting is its narrow scope;
the lack of variety; the sameness. All the pictures, (with the exception of
Roberts'), are small, modest, uneasy, anxious, awkward.
Seven painters, seven styles? Not at all. The similarity of these CCA
exhibitors is astounding, as if they all shared a studio; collaborated; were
part of a group. ``But it's sheer coincidence,'' says Richard Walker, the
oldest at 40. Osmosis is a strange phenomenon. Definitely something is in the
air.
There are good things about this show too. It's professional, witty, well
presented, (though surely there are cheaper ways of dividing up the space than
building all those corridors) and there are stools for sitting on - which
should be mandatory in all galleries. There is a smart little catalogue -
though it tells you nothing about the artists. Neither does the labelling. Can
the public have information please?
So who are these chosen seven? I remember Walker from a former figurative
period. Others are unknown. The most famous by far is Julie Roberts who
represented Britain at the 1993 Venice Biennale. She has since shown in Paris,
New York, London, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Luzern; taught at Glasgow Art School
for three years and is just off to the British School in Rome on the first
annual Scottish Arts Council Residency there.
She trained in graphics and came to Glasgow to do an MA. Fascinated by medical
instruments ancient and modern, she memorably transcribes them to float on rich
backgrounds. Bedlam Restraining Jacket is 6ft tall and richly painted, a tangle
of white ties on purple. See also her Victorian red velvet Dentist Chair and
cast iron Bed.
At the other end of the spectrum are Hayley Tompkins, a 1994 Glasgow graduate
whose tiny, unframed watercolours on paper are copied from photos in the
National Geographic, and Richard Wright who paints war victims lifted from
Manet, Goya or newspapers on postcards of sunset skies or idyllic landscapes.
Carol Rhodes, now 36, graduated from Glasgow in 1982 but, though involved with
Transmission Gallery and Variant magazine, had a long gap before picking up her
brushes again in 1993. ``I had a huge studio in Tramway but I didn't do
anything I was pleased with. Even there I painted small. Ludicrous!''
She works slowly, meticulously. ``I like everything carefully organised,
refined, structured before I start. Since I had my son I've been drawn to urban
design, the layout of paths, playgrounds and roads. Pushing a pram changes your
view.'' Her flat overlooks a park and this birds-eye view also appears in
Caravans and Factory Roof - pale, small paintings inspired by train journeys to
Edinburgh.
Airport 1995 is my favourite. Here the runways are laid out like the parterres
of a French chateau with the cluster of planes adding frilly embroidery to the
ends of drawing-board arabesques.
Rhodes has just won a #4500 SAC Award; so too Richard Walker. When Gordon, Todd
and Borland won the award they got #9000 each. Thus the recession bites.
Walker's everyday titles: Table, Grass, Bed, Carpet are low key, like the
overlooked, disintegrating fragments they depict. I like Rubble, with its ice
floe slabs, and also the petrol blue Floor. ``Some are done from life; others
from photographs,'' he says. ``They are not grandiose. I aim for atmosphere.
Painting is a definite language somewhere between words and images.''
Louise Hopkins, she of the flowery fabrics, delves deeper into coverings:
upholstery on chairs, carpet on floor, snow on mountains, feathers on bird.
Best are witty self portraits with beard. Worst are the deformed feet. Search
Graeme Todd's impressionistic landscapes for the hidden white line stem among
the Adrian Berg-ish trees and bushes.
This is perhaps best remembered as a transitional show bridging the false
divide between emotional vigour and cerebral apathy. As an alternative it is
tentative; lacking conviction. But it is honest - and honesty is the best
policy in these insecure times.

SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric is one of three energy companies on a shortlist to bid
for First Hydro, formerly the pumped storage business of the National Grid.
Two US companies Dominion Energy, a subsidiary of Virginia-based Dominion
Resources and Mission (No2) of California, are the other two companies that
have been selected to proceed to the final bidding stage.
Over the weekend the pumped storage business of the National Grid was demerged
into the ownership of PSB Holdings (PSB). This will be majority owned by the 12
regional electricity companies of England and Wales.
The business which has been rechristened First Hydro, operates two pumped
storage schemes in north Wales with a combined capacity of 2088MW.
Scottish Hydro, the Perth-based electricity generator and distributor, has been
actively pursuing a number of opportunities.
It is known to be keen to expand its energy business into electricty supply and
has been mentioned as a possible partner with British Gas in its proposed
Seabank gas-fired power station at Avonmouth near Bristol.
q.Further details of the #3700m National Grid sell-off will come on Wednesday
with the publication of its interim results and prospectus. On the same day,
unofficial trading starts in National Grid shares. Over the weekend brokers SBC
Warburg was quoting a spread of prices between 213p and 218p.

THE disaffected who slipped away at the interval may not wish to know this, but
things perked up significantly after the sponsor's half-time whisky macs. The
problem with the first half, for these ears, was not so much one of performance
as of programming.
Back-to-back Mozart piano sonatas, whose main distinguishing features were that
one was written for one piano, four hands, the other for two pianos, did not a
riveting opening make, despite the sisters' customary elan. By the time special
guest Gonzalo Rubalcaba had displayed his undoubted technique and intellect and
his love of creating sound rather than his equally undoubted ability to carry
the listener away on breathtaking flights of keyboard fancy, a somnolent mood
was growing.
The Labeques' post-interval reading of Ravel's Spanish Rhapsody changed that.
Precision. Delicacy. Enthusiasm. Theatrics. Even a touch of arrogance was there
and added to a spectacular success. If that was a populist romp then the
following two pieces, their guest's reconstruction of Besame Mucho and his ``if
Stravinsky were Cuban he might have written this'' Prologo, both played by
Katia and Rubalcaba, were more rarefied but no less gripping.
A new Rubalcaba composition, written specially for this tour, sounded like it
needed more time in the hatchery and didn't properly justify its use of three
pianos or three such highly-talented pianists. It was, however, a brief glitch
which the Labeques more than compensated for with a supercharged sprint through
the latin jazz changes of Michel Camillo's On Fire.

COMING straight after comedies by Willy Russell and John Godber, Alan
Ayckbourn's Bedroom Farce is all the more obviously bereft of a political
drive. The playwright's interest lies not in social injustice but in something
more abstract to do with the delicate balance of human relationships.
There's nothing wrong with this as such, but it does mean that where Russell,
and to a lesser extent Godber, at their best will fuse moral indignation with
explosive comedy - the one utterly dependent on the other - Ayckbourn is left
trying to keep the comedy chuckling along solely in order to support his more
serious, but largely unrelated, theme.
It's the Cornish pasty and the pilchards on toast that give the game away.
Bedroom Farce, with typically Ayckbournesque panache, presents four couples in
three separate bedrooms simultaneously playing in front of us. Into one of
those bedrooms - the repository of the coats at a suburban party - the pasty is
introduced. On form, Ayckbourn gets at least three good laughs from it.
Meanwhile in a parallel bedroom an elderly couple bring out the pilchards and,
missing the mark, Ayckbourn can only make them seem like an inane detail.
In truth, neither pasty nor pilchard is of any significance, they're just
free-floating gags latching onto the plot. And what really sustains that plot
is not the jokes but Ayckbourn's exploration of the compromises, trade-offs,
arguments and clashes that make relationships stand or fall. It's a rather more
serious play than he'd have us believe.
Joan Knight's production is amiable enough but needs to push the characters to
greater extremes both to pick up the laughs and to make the resolution (marital
harmony all round) rather more worth fighting for.

HE comes shuffling on, old Alf Garnett, white-bearded in khaki and medals - a
cranky old duffer, irascible and unpredictable. The one thing you can't accuse
Warren Mitchell's Lear of being is self-pitying. Scarcely pausing in Jude
Kelly's three-and-a-half hour production to take his mental pulse, this is the
least self-aware Lear I can remember - and the most difficult to handle.
Talk about Age Concern, no wonder Alexandra Gilbreath's Regan (whom Lear
lasciviously fondles) and Tricia Kelly's rejected, religious Goneril turn
nasty. Mitchell's Lear is enough to try the patience of a saint.
Kelly's West Yorkshire Playhouse production is full of such felicitous and apt
re-assessments. Fascinatingly designed by Paul Andrews and lit by Mark
Pritchard as a nowhere/anywhere land, it also increasingly assumes the
appearance of Golgotha. A country so divided against itself, Kelly seems to
suggest, is on the path to self-destruction. At the end, Jonathan Savage's King
of France
threatens an ominous kind of inheritance, challenging Michael Cashman's
wonderfully weedy Duke of Albany down the barrel of a gun.
Never less than coherent and moodily topical - self-mutilations, bluesy jazz
scores, and a punkish Kent when in disguise - Kelly's refusal to indulge in
fake histrionics or sympathy also however means we lose the comfort of
catharsis save for the delicate reconciliation between Lear and Cordelia,
father and favourite daughter.
The greatest barrier to enjoyment though is simply in making sense of the
words. Is Matcham's Hackney Empire to blame or are we really losing the art of
speaking Shakespeare? This father of all tragedies with its dire national
repercussions so deserves to succeed. At present, though, it's a hard slog.

``DAMON from Blur wouldn't even shake my hand after we did the Jools Holland
Show,'' mumbles Aimee Mann during one of her many nervy song introductions.
The self-appointed Britpop leader may well have been showing his ignorance, for
Mann's solo ascent to the level of hobnobbing with the stars on TV shows has
seen her tread an engaging path in beatnik pop, taking many of Albarn's musical
inspirations long before his own change of direction in 1991.
The musical lineage is McCartney, Costello, Davies, and Tilbrook, but where
Blur opt for Cockney singalong lyrics, Mann's perspective is thoughtful and
introspective, American and downbeat.
It is the latter, coupled with her nervousness, which makes Mann a slightly
unsatisfying live act.
The singles from her debut album, namely Fourth of July, Could Have Been
Anyone, and I Should Have Known, get the most enthusiastic response, but as the
best songs also suffer the most from the performer's inhibitions, sometimes you
wish Aimee Mann would free herself from her self-imposed shackles and then she
might really rock.
Ironically the newer songs from I'm With Stupid fare better. While the record
sounds like a half-baked collection of good but unfinished ideas, live
performance has filled out and improved the likes of Make a Killing and No
Choice in the Matter, while Sugarcoated and Superball are the type of
well-structured pop songs expected of her.
Mann is a major writing talent lacking only the self-belief required to become
a multi-platinum star and convincing live act. Perhaps the next time it will be
her refusing the outstretched hand.

SURE enough, Theatre Sans Frontieres' assurance that a very meagre grasp of the
French language would not curtail my enjoyment of their absurd story of love,
conspiracy, and horticulture, was well founded. As someone who barely made
Higher grade more years ago than I'd care to reveal, some of the finer points
of the intrigue and the misunderstandings which set the tale in motion did
escape me, but my ears quickly atuned.
In any case, the company's boldly physical performance style and visual
staging, and the pantomimic repetition of key words and phrases, meant that
language really was no barrier. Indeed, I left the theatre almost believing
that I could converse fluently in French.
This is a company who are not short of energy, broad knockabout humour, and a
store of wonderfully inventive theatrical tricks. Stephan Kreiss, oscillating
schizophrenically between Gryphus, the evil jailer, and his soft dog, Moloch,
gave a superbly over-the-top performance; the ensemble conjuring of a flock of
cooing pigeons was simple and spot-on (more than a hint of Theatre de
Complicite); and the multi-purpose wheeled set was used at times to great
effect. But, overall, it was just a little too busy, too relentlessly physical
and energetic. The wealth of theatrical tricks could have been employed with a
little more economy, and we could all have had a little space to breathe.
But, hey, Christmas isn't far off, and I don't wish to be churlish. In any
case, although the claim for first panto of the season has long since been

IT TAKES a special talent to create a magical atmosphere in a sparsely filled
auditorium on a freezing Scottish November night, but the Moscow Art Trio,
making their second appearance in the capital, managed it with room to spare.
As their previous visit two years ago proved, it is their talent to surprise
which is so special. When a piece begins with a strutting, jazzy piano vamp
there is no reason to suspect that it is going to continue as a prayer-like
folk song and wind up with the singer's colleagues marching off stage as if in
some contrapuntal dispute as he brings it to a ``so there'' conclusion. But
this is what you get.
These Moscovites like their bit of comic drama, and their bit of tragi-comedy.
Pianist Mikhail Alperin's nonchalant whistling along to a one-handed, tinkling
melody, which he interrupted only to criticise Arkadij Shikloper's flugelhorn
contribution, was deserving of an Oscar.
But alongside the fooling around there's some stunningly beautiful music, much
of it pastoral, elegiac almost. Sergeij Starosin, whose vocals evoke a direct
link between Moldavian folk song and both Native American chants and Gaelic
mouth music, produced a spellbinding feature on a simple wooden flute, played
one-fingered. And Shikloper's subtle use of electronics with his French horn
produced rumbling, guitar-like riffs as well as ethereal, flutey melodies
alongside Alperin's by turns thunderous and fastidiously executed keyboard
figures.
More than almost any other ensemble I can think of, however, these three
players work superbly as a team, be it a team of nutters, virtuosi or
multi-instrumental arm-chancers. Next time they visit, you are seriously
advised not to miss them.

A TOP price of 7500gns for the gimmer which was female champion at this year's
Royal Show was the feature of the collective sale of pedigree Suffolk females
in Perth on Saturday.
Selling the gimmer, which is carrying twin lambs by the 26,000gns Cairness
Court, was John Sinnett, Stockton Court, Worcester, while the buyer was Jimmy
Douglas, Woodhead of Cairness, Fraserburgh.
Mr Sinnett also enjoyed a great trade for his select offering of ewe lambs
hitting a top of 5500gns for one which sold to Gordon Wilson, Bogs of
Paithnick, Keith.
Two Stockton ewe lambs attracted Irish interest with the first making 3500gns
to David Duncan, Laurelbank, Crumlin, County Antrim, with another selling at
3000gns to Tom Bailly, Batterstown, County Meath.
A one-crop ewe from the same home also sold at 2800gns to S G Mair and Sons,
Kinnermit, Turriff.
The largest consignment on offer was from the Cairness flock of Jimmy Douglas
and his gimmers were keenly bid for with a top of 3000gns on three occasions.
Firstly to Albert Howie, Knock, Huntly, then to John Sinnett, and finally to
Iain Barbour, Beechgrove, Annan.
Next best was one at 2900gns to Mrs Nan Muir, The Rectory, Cairness,
Fraserburgh. J R Woodier, Wits' End Cottage, Hartford, Cheshire, took two,
first at 2200gns and then at 2600gns.
R A Barcklay, Dunlop, Ballymena, took one at 2000gns with Robert Watts,
Clifford Chambers, Warwickshire, paying the same price.
Clair Drummond, Straid, Girvan, and Iain Barbour also paid 1800gns to give Mr
Douglas gross takings for his 59 head of #52,657. The draft from the
Bridgestone flock of Jimmy Wilson, Barnyards, Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire, was
headed at 1400gns for a gimmer which sold to Mrs C Belcher, Worcester.
Overall: 49 Cairness gimmers averaged #949.93 with 10 ewes averaging #611.10.
Nine Stockton gimmers averaged #1349.83, 16 ewes averaged #704.16, and 12 ewe
lambs averaged #1452.50. 28 Bridgestone gimmers averaged #531.31, and 12 ewes
averaged #318.50. Auctioneers: United Auctions Limited.

AORTECH Europe, a Scottish high-tech company which makes artificial heart
valves, has received a #750,000 equity boost from venture capital firm 3i to
finance its rapid expansion.
3i has taken a 30% stake in the firm based near Bellshill, Lanarkshire, to help
market the mechanical valve and develop export markets.
AorTech was started up by Scottish businessmen Gordon Wright and Eddie McDaid
three years ago and aims to make its first profit this year.
It is cagey about numbers, because of stiff competition from a handful of large
multinational firms which produce similar products.
However, Mr Wright, the chairman, says sales will double this year giving
Aortech a turnover of several million pounds.
Although the company has just 26 employees, it exports its products all over
the world and is keen to manufacture new ones under subcontract.
3i was attracted to AorTech because it had previously backed successful
business ventures by Mr Wright and Mr McDaid in the past.
``AorTech is a dynamic young company with a market leading product,'' said Mr
Roy McKelvie, the Glasgow-based investment executive who negotiated the deal.

A NUMBER of major companies report interim figures this week starting with
Thorn EMI and Vodafone tomorrow.
Apart from the results from the former, analysts will be looking for further
news on the proposed demerger into two companies, one covering music and the
other consumer equipment rentals. The group had indicated it would give more
information in the ``early winter''.
Thorn EMI has issued first quarter figures, so analysts are quite confident in
their first half estimates which range from #173m to #180m, against #126m.
There have been conflicting views over the health of the music industry, but
EMI is expected to have done well.
Analysts will be keen to hear the group's own view, but prospects look bright
given new albums issued by Queen, Meatloaf, and Janet Jackson. Queen has hit
number one while Meatloaf has reached gold status and Janet Jackson platinum.
And the Beatles Anthology is due to be released on November 21.
Northern Foods also comes tomorrow and the picture will be less bright though
the market will be looking for benefits from the heavy rationalisation which
has occurred in liquid milk.
Vodafone will be going on a charm offensive to try and get its shares rated
more highly. Some analysts reckon that in comparison with other similar
companies they should be nearer 300p than 250p. First half profits of #205m to
#225m are expected, up from #186m, on continued subscriber growth and cost
reduction.
Wednesday sees Courtaulds which will be a complete contrast, showing a fall of
some 14% to #70m in six months profits. The problem is pressure on margins as
raw material prices have risen sharply. Demand is weak so passing on these
hikes is difficult, particularly in fibres.
Granada is the only major blue chip to report full year figures this week and
should post profits of around #340m against #265m, with the contract catering
arm, Sutcliffe, trading particularly well. The television interests will be
also ahead.
Thursday sees another engineering group Babcock International reporting first
half figures. The group is part of the Rosyth 2000 consortium selected to
redevelop the naval base. The market will be looking for a decent rise in first
half profits.
Macdonald Martin Distilleries also reports six monthly profits and a useful
improvement over the comparable #2.63m is likely, helped by lower financing
costs.
Friday sees figures from two more Scottish companies, Grampian Television and
Stoddard Sekers. Grampian will benefit from rising advertising revenue and an
increasing audience for Scot FM radio. Stoddard is still facing depressed
demand but raw material cost pressure may have eased and financing costs should
be lower.

TWO well-known emigrant Scottish farmers, now based in Australia, will be
returning to their roots next summer to judge cattle and sheep at the Royal
Highland Show.
Jimmy Young, originally from Congeith in Dumfriesshire - now of Congeith, South
Australia - will judge the Simmental cattle classes.
David Thomson, who used to farm Kinpurny and Fullarton in the Meigle area of
Perthshire, is now resident in West Australia and he will fly in to place the
North Country Cheviot sheep. One other overseas judge will be F Polinder Jr
from Washington, USA, whose area of expertise is the heavy horse turnouts.
The Queen's Cup, which will be awarded to the winner of the overall
championship in the light horse section, will be judged by well-known Borders'
livestock farmer Charles Scott of East Middle, Hawick.
Veteran heavy horse enthusiast Ian McGregor of Annbank, Ayr, who has acted as a
steward in the heavy horse rings for a number of years will change roles when
he selects the championship in that section.
In the dairy cattle rings, David Hill, Southminster, Essex, will decide the
overall dairy cattle championship, the inter-breed team and the progeny group
competitions. The three breeds which will be represented in the championship
will be Ayrshire, Jersey and British Holstein/Holstein Friesian.
The overall beef championship, which this year is to receive the Royal Bank of
Scotland Trophy by rotation, will be judged by Russell Taylor of Errol.
The overall sheep championship will be placed by Border Leicester and Texel
breeder Keith Jamieson of Southgill, Annan. Jim Stobo of Nabdean,
Berwick-on-Tweed, will select the overall sheep pairs inter-breed.

ANECDOTE. At half-time on Saturday night, having emerged (numbed) from the
performance of Brahms's First Piano Concerto given by Grigory Sokolov with
conductor Walter Weller and the RSNO, I bumped into a diehard musical
sophisticate who was so moved she was almost beyond words. ``Staggering,'' was
all she said, eyes filled, shaking her head, then moving on.
What we had just heard from pianist Sokolov (with a few irrelevant splodgy
wrong notes) was, I think, one of the greatest accounts of the Brahms that I
have ever experienced. In Liverpool, where I first heard it a week-and-a-half
ago, it was almost supreme. Since then - having been played by the same team
another five times - it has matured into something near-perfect.
This was a concerto played by a master strategist. To sum up Sokolov, he has a
consummate command of the dramatic, lyrical, and structural complex that is the
Brahms. The epic first movement, in the wrong hands, can be lumpen and
sprawling. Sokolov's version, at a broad pace with tons of inner momentum, was
a structural masterpiece, a gripping drama seething with powerhouse piano
playing and caressed by the lightest touches imaginable.
In the great slow movement, time stopped with the sheer concentration of the
moment, until Sokolov's massive approach to the climax over a growling pedal
note in the basses, where he screwed up tension so tight that the final release
was juddering. This was followed by a wondrously buoyant finale that was
nothing less than a catharsis.
Technically, musically, and psychologically, this was a wonderful performance
from everybody, orchestra and conductor seamlessly welded to the flexible
masterpiece being constructed by this astonishing Russian pianist. They must
get him back.
Poor old Dvorak's Fifth Symphony - a sunny version, better integrated than its
first outing in Liverpool - had to take a back seat in the aftershock of the
first half.

<HEADLINE>TAKEOVERS Welsh Water expected to launch bid for Swalec</HEADLINE>

WELSH Water is expected to launch a bid for South Wales Electricity, (Swalec)
this week, valuing the company at more than #1000m or about #11.10p per share.
Such terms would be far short of the effective #12.70 which the American
utility Central and South-West is paying for Seeboard, but they would be much
more than Welsh's #10.20 indicative price.
If unsuccessful, Welsh Water has been approached by an American company with a
view to make a joint hostile bid for Swalec, although this is believed to be
the least acceptable option.
Welsh Water and Swalec held inconclusive talks last week after which Swalec
said it was ``very disappointed'' that Welsh Water had still not clarified
whether it intended to make a bid for the company. In the meantime, Swalec has
advised its shareholders to take no action.
Welsh Water first expressed an interest in acquiring Swalec five years ago when
it purchased a 15% stake in what is the smallest regional electricity company.
Using much the same arguments as North West Water in its successful bid for
Norweb, Welsh Water believes that a merger with Swalec would provide
considerable scope for combining services such as billing and customer calls.
Swalec has said it cannot see greater savings for a merged company than #11.2m
compared with its own plans for #45m in cost cuts from the current #120m a year.
Welsh Water is due to publish its interim results on Friday which are expected
to show pre-tax profits growth from #49.4m to between #78 and #81m. The
dividend is forecast to increase from 9.3p to between 10.25 and 10.7p per share.

MILNGAVIE Controls, the heating and ventilation controls specialist, has
completed several large contracts in the past three years, including the new
Scottish Office in Edinburgh and the Inland Revenue's new home in East Kilbride.
Mr Brian Mallon, managing director of Milngavie Controls, was quick to dispel
any thoughts that the company had not felt the effects of the recession.
``We have been fortunate to gain several large contracts but the bread and
butter work is missing,'' he said.
Until three years ago, the Clydebank-based company had been on an expansion
curve with annual turnover reaching #4m.
``During the past three years we have managed to maintain our turnover around
the #4m figure by securing the larger contracts as well as taking on work which
would have been too small for us in the past,'' said Mr Mallon.
He is ``cautiously optimistic'' that the company can start to expand again.
Earlier this year, it invested #500,000 in a new office on the banks of the
Clyde near the HCI private hospital complex in Clydebank.
``We hope to secure two large capital contracts next year, and if this happens
it will be the first real growth for the comapny for four years.''
Mr Mallon has been with Milngavie Controls for 25 years and has seen big
changes as computerisation has been introduced into the design of heating,
ventilation and air conditioning systems.
``We now not only design systems but also write the software packages for
them,'' he said, ``and we operate a maintainance system whereby our computers
are in constant touch with on-site systems.
``If something goes wrong, our customer's computer phones our computer which in
turn alerts our emergency stand-by engineer.''
Milngavie Controls keeps a close eye on the property development market as any
new development gives the company an opportunity to bid for work.
Milngavie Controls now employs 75 compared with the 20 who were with the
company when it started. Mr Mallon takes pleasure from the fact that seven
employees have been with the company for 25 years or more.

THAT old rogue, Robert Stephens would, I think, have enjoyed this irreverent,
slightly camp but stylish collection of songs, sketches and anecdotes around
the Bard of Avon and the whole damn Shakespeare `thang.
First staged as a one-man, light summer diversion by RSC actor Christopher
Luscombe like topsey, it now sports five, including pianist accompanist and
co-deviser Malcolm McKee. It marks a welcome return to the long neglected art
of revue - particularly so when in the hands of the likes of Susan Blake and
Martin Connor and the spectacularly talented Janie Dee whose ability to hit top
notes from Verdi as well as dance and act divinely is awe-inspiring.
Luscombe's trawl through the Great and Good (among others, Alan Melville, Monty
Python, Victoria Wood, Maureen Lipman and Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie), reveals
some delightful gems, not least just how many Shakespearean phrases have
entered our daily vocabulary (courtesy of Bernard Levin). Fascinating Aida's
Dillie Keane and Adele Anderson brilliantly naughty musical version of the
French courting scene from Henry V all bring the house down.
Now and again an air of slight ``in-crowd'' luvviness does seep in but on the
day that the death of Robert Stephens was announced, Sondheim's setting of Fear
No More The Heat of the Sun and Caryl Brahms and Ned Sherrin's gentle ode to
Falstaff's girlfriends, Ladies of London, became a moving epitaph to one of the
RSC's greatest interpreters of the role.

HOLIDAYMAKERS in Malaga could find themselves dancing the night away to
Scottish disco music, if John Burns decides to spread his JBD empire to the
continent.
JBD Discotheque Services already provides the disco music in 88 pubs and clubs
throughout Scotland, and have 91 DJs on its books.
Mr Burns gave up his job as a bricklayer with Glasgow District Council in 1984
to become a full-time disc jockey at the Ibrox House pub in Glasgow.
``I could earn #100 a week working four days as a disco jockey,'' he recalled.
``It was a lot better than the #82 a week I was getting as a brickie.''
Prior to quitting his day job, he had been a semi-professional DJ providing the
music for church or charity discos using a record turntable he had bought
through a catalogue.
``I can remember paying it up at #2.50 a week over 52 weeks,'' he said.
JBD is now big business with an annual turnover of #1.5m a years. The
transformation from being a self employed DJ to running a successful business
empire started almost immediately.
``I quickly found that I was receiving more engagements than I could handle
myself,'' said Mr Burns, ``and the people that I was having to turn down told
me that they were happy to have someone else provide the music, as long as it
was of the same standard I provided.''
He found another DJ for the Black Jacks pub in Glasgow Hope Street, and JBD
Services was in business.
``I employ several superivisors who are responsible for a number of venues and
speak to the managements involved. They make sure that the proper music is
being played to suit the customers in that establishment and also to discuss
promotional activities.''
Mr Burns gave up being an active DJ six years ago to concentrate on running the
business, although he still has his collection of 7000 singles and 4000 CDs.
``I audition around 20 DJs every week who would like to work with us, but we
are careful who we take on. It is not good enough just to stick endless music
on. Customers like to hear a voice otherwise you may as well just put a long
tape on, and forget the DJ.''
JBD is considering the invitation to offer its services to Spanish clubs.

WHEN the electrical trading company they worked for closed down their
North-east base, Mr Jim Gray and Mr Gus Cruikshank spotted a gap in the market
The result was that six years ago the former school chums opened Powerhouse
Electrical Company supplying specialist lamps for oil rigs and shipping lines.
``We tried to fill a gap by stocking lamps and bulbs that other people would
not bother to stock because the orders would be too small,'' said Mr Gray.
The strategy obviously succeeded as Powerhouse Electrical Company has now
opened an office in Falkirk aimed at the market in central belt.
``We believe there is great potential for the Forth and Clyde ports,'' said Mr
Gray. ``We want to supply the shipping lines operating out of these ports.''
This means having a stock of such specialist lights as navigation lamps and man
overboard lights.
In the Falkirk area, the company will operate as Powerhouse Specialist Lamps
and Mr Gray is delighted with the first month's figures.
``Our first month in Falkirk is more than triple what we did in Aberdeen when
we opened up, and we would expect by opening in Falkirk to more than double our
annual turnover of #250,000,'' he said.
In addition to targeting chandlers in the West and East, Mr Gray and Mr
Cruikshank also hope to make further inroads into the the hotel and pub trade.
In the Aberdeen area the company supplies 300 pubs, clubs and hotels, and by
opening in Falkirk it hopes to be able to do business with the leading hotels
chains.
``The hotel industry is becoming conscious of energy saving lamps which can
reduce their electricity bills by 15 to 20%,'' said Mr Gray.
Powerhouse were able to plan their expansion, thanks to reaching a factoring
agreement with Kellock.
``This means that we are no longer waiting for our money, and this gave us the
facility to expand. We can now approach the manufacturers of lamps in Europe
directly, and obtain a better price which makes us more competitive.
``The European companies demand cash up front - they do not give you credit,
and the Kellock deal has allowed us to buy direct.''
Powerhouse has a stock of 2500 different items which means that they can cater
for most requests.

A BOSNIAN peace deal looked set to be agreed at the US talks before today's 3pm
deadline.
The warring factions last night decided on a constitution for the country and
planned to negotiate territorial disputes through the night, according to
Croatian television. A Balkan official also said the last obstacles were being
surmounted.
The official said he expected the peace plan ``to be clinched'' soon. ``Whether
or not it will be a good plan for us remains to be seen, but it will be
signed.''
Croatian state television said the constitution called for a Muslim-Croat and a
Serb entity.
The report had yet to be officially confirmed at the peace talks being held at
a US Air Force base in Dayton, Ohio.
A Western diplomatic source said the parties had settled the matter of
elections for a new Bosnian state, although the fate of Sarajevo, and two
disputed land corridors were still under negotiation.
``There has been progress,'' he said. He said Muslims and Serbs were having a
very difficult time agreeing the territorial issues because they are at the
heart of their war.
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said: ``They are down now to the two or
three make-or-break issues that will decide whether or not there is a peace
settlement for Bosnia.''
Mr McCurry said President Bill Clinton was in ``close consultation'' with
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and US mediator Richard Holbrooke.
Asked on CNN if Mr Clinton would travel to Dayton, Mr McCurry said: ``He will
do whatever he needs to do to help these parties get across the finish line.''

decide whether or not there is a peace settlement for Bosnia.''
Mr McCurry said President Bill Clinton was in ``close consultation'' with
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and US mediator Richard Holbrooke.
Asked on CNN if Mr Clinton would travel to Dayton, Mr McCurry said: ``He will
do whatever he needs to do to help these parties get across the finish line.''
In a further positive sign, the Security Council met in informal consultations
to discuss suspending sanctions against Belgrade. The council's emergency
session was also set to consider suspending the arms embargo against Bosnia, a
demand by the Sarajevo government.
Earlier, in a briefing designed to keep maximum pressure on the leaders of
Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia, state department chief spokesman Nicholas Burns
announced the 3pm deadline. Agreement would have to be reached by the end of
the talks if it were to be initialled by today's deadline.
``Today has to be the day they reach an agreement and tomorrow has to be the
defining day when they initial it,'' Burns said. He added that if no agreement
were reached, the United States would simply hold a news conference to explain
why the the talks failed.
Sources close to the talks said that an agreement had been held up by a demand
from the badly-split Bosnian delegation that the arms embargo imposed on their
country be lifted once a peace deal was reached.
That demand threw the talks off balance, even though negotiators made great
headway on such key issues as the future of Sarajevo, a constitution for the
new Bosnian state, and Bosnian Serb demands for a corridor linking their lands.
One source said the Bosnian demand for arms was the potential ``deal-breaker''.
Burns said the United States continued to resist including that matter in a
formal peace agreement. Instead, he said, Washington would deal with that issue
separately later.
In what was widely seen as a sign of hope, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
flew to Dayton saying he has been told an agreement was expected to be
initialled.
Burns, however, continued to try to put a lid on rising expectations,
contending that Tudjman must have received some incorrect information from his
delegation at Dayton.
But several sources close to the Balkan delegations were more optimistic.
``Things are coming to an end. They are being wrapped up as we speak,'' one
Balkan source said.
A Western diplomat confirmed that a deal was close. ``I am predicting that by
tomorrow night we will be there. The map is very close. They have not yet
agreed on Sarajevo but there are a couple of options that both sides have said
are acceptable.
``The corridors are the problem but I think on the whole the map is going to be
resolved,'' the diplomat said.
He said final documents were being translated into English, Bosnian, Croatian
and Serbian, and staff were ready to work all night if necessary. - Reuter.

St Johnstone 1, Dunfermline 0
ALAN Main's luck has changed - and it's not a moment too soon for the St
Johnstone keeper. He proved it on Saturday at McDiarmid Park with an inspired
display that broke the hearts of first-division leaders Dunfermline - and sent
confidence soaring through the Saints team.
After the match, Main admitted that he had not exactly been a pin-up player
with the fans since signing in January of this year from Dundee United.
But everything seems to be clicking into place since a penalty save at
Dumbarton at the beginning of this month. He said: ``I saved that spot kick,
and we raced up the field and scored. I had a shut-out last week, and another
one today. I'm feeling much happier about my form.''
Efforts from David Bingham, Ryan Hegarty, Marc Millar, and Stewart Petrie that
you would have bet on to hit the back of the net, were blocked by Main.
It would have given the Fifers a point their second- half pressure merited. It
would also have spoiled Saints manager Paul Sturrock's record of watching his
side notch three successive league victories since he took over a couple of
seasons ago.
He said afterwards: ``The most pleasing aspect for me was that the three
teenagers we have brought in were still on the field at the end. I don't think
any of them let themselves down today, and I think we are going in the right
direction.''
Saints' goal came from striker Kevin Twaddle - a real handful for a Dunfermline
defence weakened by injury - when he ran through on a Philip Scott headed pass
to slot the ball behind Guido van de Kamp. Twaddle, however, had to be
substituted near the end because of ``a migraine and blurred vision.''
Dunfermline manager Bert Paton, with nine first-team regulars sidelined, also
had to call in some youngsters - with former Dundee United striker Hegarty,
nephew of Paul and son of Kevin, looking a real prospect.
John Fraser of Oakley United and Stephen Ferguson of Rosyth Juniors were the
other two drafted into the squad. Paton said: ``Hegarty got the nod because he
was the oldest at 19.''
However, despite a run of indifferent results - only one win in their past four
league games - the Fifers amazingly are still a point ahead at the top.
``They're having bother killing us,'' Paton joked, as he added the good news
that five of his first-team squad should be fit for next week.

ELECTRONICS companies in Scotland yesterday came under fire over short-term
temporary contracts for workers.
The Silicon Glen investors, who have created thousands of jobs in Scotland,
have been accused by trade unions of recruiting staff on a short term basis,
often only a week or two, to tide them over a busy period, before paying them
off.
The workers are often called back on similar contracts as work fluctuates, but
are never offered a permanent post.
Mr Bill Speirs, deputy general secretary of the STUC, said many workers did not
belong to a trade union and because contracts were short term they had no
protection over working conditions and no job security.
He said temporary contracts were thought to be common among many of the
electronics companies which had invested in Scotland's Silicon Glen.
Mr Speirs said school leavers were among those targeted by the companies.

A SCOTTISH fire chief this week will raise concerns for the safety of
firefighters attending Guy Fawkes calls.
In a report to a meeting of Lothian and Borders Fire Board, Mr Colin Cranston,
the area's firemaster, will highlight numerous occasions earlier this month
where crews faced hostility from missile-throwing gangs.
On one occasion in the west of Edinburgh, a firefighter had to be hospitalised
for an eye injury which led to two nights' absence from duty.
The board will be told on Wednesday that attacks on crews were not limited to
one part of Edinburgh but happened in a number of areas in the city, West
Lothian, and Midlothian.
The report, too, mentions incidents in Edinburgh and West Lothian in which
children and youths placed Liquified Petroleum Gas cylinders on bonfires.
It also states that, as far back as 1992, the board made representations to the
Secretary of State for Scotland seeking support for a strengthening of the law
in the area of firework control.
At a meeting 18 months later, the board voiced concern in relation to impending
relaxations in import licensing needs for fireworks.
``The problems predicted by the board have clearly come to fruition,'' Mr
Cranston said.

Ties to be played on 2 December with a 1.45pm kick-off.
q YOKER can thank a fine display from keeper Frank Brogan for their continued
interest in the OVD Cup.
They were put under pressure by Bo'ness right from the start and only a series
of outstanding saves by Brogan kept their hopes alive. Reduced to 10 men
following the dismissal of Elliott in normal time, they were in further trouble
in extra time with the loss of centre half Walker for a double booking. Then on
to the penalty decider with the scoresheet blank.
Despite three penalty saves by Neil Binnie of Bo'ness, Brogan again made the
saves which gave Yoker a 4-3 shoot-out victory.
It was an off-day for Shettleston in their OVD Cup replay against Dunipace with
Fisher and Nelson being dismissed in the first half. Dunipace took full
advantage and led 2-0 with goals from Jim Gray and Ritchie Francis. Scott
Miller scored a late consolation goal for Shettleston.
Goals from Rae and McCall midway in the second half helped Arniston Rangers
progress to the third round at the expense of Lesmahagow, who finished the game
with nine men following the ordering off of McAlear and substitute McKay.
With Arthurlie on cup duty, league rivals Petershill and Pollok narrowed the
gap at the top of the Reebok Premier Division.
Petershill's top scorer Stewart MacDonald gave them a 1-0 victory over Benburb,
while Pollok fought back from two down to defeat Baillieston 3-2.
Ardeer Thistle reached their second cup final of the season with their 3-1 win
over Glenafton in the Irvine Times Cup. They will now meet Kilwinning Rangers,
who beat Cumnock 1-0.
In the Whyte and Mackay Cup, Arthurlie disposed of Annbank at the second
attempt but only after the game was decided on penalties, with keeper Sandy
McLean making four saves in the shoot-out.
Arthurlie will now meet Kilbirnie, who beat Bellshill 3-1 in their second-round
replay. Results:

A TEENAGER was in intensive care last night after collapsing at a nightclub in
Perth. The girl was the third drugs casualty of Scotland's rave scene in as
many weeks.
The Government has confirmed plans in the Queen's Speech to clamp down on raves
in Scotland.
The latest incident occurred days after English teenager Leah Betts lost her
fight for life after taking ecstasy.
The 17-year-old girl was taken to the intensive care of Perth Royal Infirmary
on Saturday night after collapsing at a nightclub in the town's George Street.
Her condition at first gave doctors ``serious cause for concern''. However,
last night the hospital said she had started showing signs of making a recovery
and was in a stable condition.
Leah Betts died on Thursday. One week earlier Stornoway teenager, David
Stewart, 15, spent more than 24 hours in a coma after taking derivatives of
ecstasy. He is now recovering at home.
Lee Harper, 18, from Caol, near Fort William, is still in an isolation ward in
the town's Belford Hospital two weeks after developing severe allergies after
taking the drug. Doctors have warned he is likely to suffer side effects for
the rest of his life.
The latest incident occurred at Perth's Club Five nightclub. Police said the
girl slumped to the floor of the club shortly after 11pm on Saturday. She had
an immediate reaction after taking a white powder which was amphetamine-based.
Police said they have taken possession of a quantity of the powder and are
trying to identify the supplier.
The parents of the girl, who lives in a small Perthshire village, were at her
bedside last night.
The two owners of the club, Mr Keith Sinclair, a Dundee publican, and Mr Tommy
Orr, a Perth restaurateur, were not available for comment last night.
Detective Inspector John Mackay, of Tayside Police, said: ``Recent tragic
events in England illustrate all too well the dangers of taking any substance.
This incident brings it home that we are not isolated from the same problem.''
Meanwhile, detectives investigating the death of Leah Betts yesterday
questioned four people after seizing 900 tablets.
Police raided a cafe in Brentwood, Essex, on Saturday night after a tip-off
resulting from appeals for information about drug pushers in the county.
Leah took ecstasy at her 18th birthday party.
The arrests were not being directly linked to Leah's case and officers were
last night still hunting the person who sold her the tablet.
The Hanger 13 nightclub in Ayr, a popular rave venue, was shut down earlier
this year after three young people died.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's bid to clamp down on raves and make them
safer was given the go-ahead in the Queen's Speech last week when it was
announced that new licensing conditions would be imposed to control them.
Deaths at raves, usually involving ecstasy, are normally triggered by
dehydration.
The Scottish Drugs Forum has been asked to prepare advice for organisers,
setting out the practical steps which can be taken, such as providing
``chill-out areas'', free drinking water and appropriate stewarding.
Under the Scottish Office proposals, licensing boards would be given the power
to attach specific conditions to licences for premises used for raves to
enhance the safety requirements covering the events.
A key feature will be to target potential and actual drug misuse.
Mr Forsyth has promised more police officers on the beat to enforce the new
regulations.

Dundee United 2, Dundee 3.
IT WAS a notable weekend for Dundee as they prepared for their biggest game of
the season - the Coca-Cola Cup final clash with Aberdeen at Hampden next Sunday.
They crossed the street to Tannadice to win this derby game, they moved into
second place in the first division as all their rivals slipped, and they had
the satisfaction of knowing that Aberdeen lost to Raith Rovers.
Little wonder, then, that manager Jim Duffy was preaching relaxation for his
players after this victory.
``This will help our lads relax,'' he pointed out. ``If we had lost today, then
I might have had problems wondering if I should start making changes in the
team before the final or altering the tactics for that game. Now, for the next
couple of days, the players can simply enjoy this win and then in the middle of
the week they can start to look forward to Hampden.
``The way they handled this occasion today suggests to me that they can handle
the bigger one next week.''
The way they opened the game would have worried any Aberdeen spy in the
Tannadice stands. Striker George Shaw helped himself to two goals in the first
15 minutes. Both were headers, the first when the United defence could not cope
with a cross from Paul Tosh, and the second when they were equally poor at
attempting to deal with a cross from Dusan Vrto.
The third goal - this time from Morton Wieghorst - arrived via a clever Neil
McCann corner just after half-time, and by then United looked down and out.
Manager Billy Kirkwood admitted: ``You cannot hand Dundee a three-goal lead and
hope to take something out of the game. As far as I am concerned, the goals we
gave away were criminal.
``Then we missed chances. Owen Coyle, for instance, should have got one back
just before half-time. We did get into the game, and the players deserve credit
for that and, in the end, we deserved better than defeat.''
Second-half substitute Craig Brewster scored the first goal in 57 minutes and
then Maurice Malpas, playing his 500th league game for United, added another 20
minutes from the end. However, United were unable to get another, though their
revival did cause Dundee some concern. Dane Wieghorst pointed out: ``We will
have to tighten up against Aberdeen in the final. We cannot be as slack in
defence as we were today when we were three goals ahead.
``But I think that all of us feel good about the game next week even though
only one or two of the players have played at Hampden before.
``It would be nice to go there and to win a medal and then also win promotion.''
That last remark will be looked on as good news by the Dundee support.
Wieghorst is signing month-to-month contracts at the moment, but this was a
fairly clear indication that he may remain at Dens Park until the team go into
the premier division.
First, though, Aberdeen and the Coca-Cola Cup final loom for Jim Duffy and his
men. The Dens Park fans, starved of success for so many years, will be
travelling to Glasgow in huge numbers. Already the club has sold more than
15,000 tickets and this derby win will inspire still more sales this week.
Fuelled by the exploits of Raith Rovers last season - and their victory on
Saturday - there is a growing belief on Tayside that another final shock may be
lying in wait for the men from the premier division when the two teams line up
at Hampden.

FIFA president Joao Havelange has come in for severe personal criticism as the
power struggle with UEFA intensifies.
His European counterpart, Lennart Johannson, who has declared his aim to
succeed him as head of the world's ruling body, accused the ageing Brazilian of
being a dictator and surrounding himself with incompetents.
Swede Johannson claimed: ``Havelange used dirty tricks to defeat Antonio
Mataresse at the last elections, so I must be more clever this time.
``If I become the new president, my first act will be to ensure FIFA is ruled
democratically and not like a dictatorship. It is time people were elected
because of their ability and not because of their friendship with Havelange or
their nationality.
``I hate the way FIFA now operates. Under Havelange, people have been put in
charge who are incompetent.
``For instance, finance is so important nowadays, yet FIFA have never been able
to sell the television rights to the World Cup for more than $184m.
``I could snap my fingers this moment and have an offer of more than a billion
dollars. Look at the difference that would make to football!''
q AJAX have been warned there will be trouble if they persist in banning
supporters of Ferencvaros from their Champions' League tie in Amsterdam on
December 6.
The Hungarian champions were fined by UEFA for the racial insults heaped upon
the Dutch in their first meeting. Bitterness still divides the clubs and Ajax
president Michael van Praag insists he will not permit fascist fans into his
stadium.
But Istvan Szivos, in charge at Ferencvaros, maintained: ``Our supporters have
already booked flights and bought tickets for the game in Holland. I foresee
serious trouble if they are locked out.''
Meanwhile, Ajax Amsterdam strolled to a 4-1 victory over Groningen yesterday,
extending their unbeaten run in the Dutch first division to 49 games and taking
their goal tally after 15 matches to an astonishing 55-5.
The combined efforts of Patrick Kluivert and Finnish international Jari
Litmanen helped Ajax to an early 2-0 lead. Ajax extended their lead after 69
minutes through Nwankwo Kanu, Marc Overmars made it 4-0 eight minutes from
time, but Groningen's persistence paid off with a minute to go when defender
Maarten de Jong scored.
q CHANGES in the Champions' League format, offering places to those clubs
eliminated in the preliminary rounds, will be confirmed at UEFA's executive
meeting on December 7.
And despite all the criticism, it seems that UEFA are determined to raise the
profile of the much-maligned Inter-Toto Cup. The top six clubs will qualify for
the UEFA Cup next season as against four this season.
q RAMON Mendoza will officially step down as president of Real Madrid today
with one of the worst records in the history of the game. In his 10 years in
office he somehow accumulated a #60m debt at one of the richest clubs in the
world.
q ALESSANDRO Del Piero's first-half header against Fiorentina brought champions
Juventus their first win in two months yesterday as the top of the table clash
between Parma and Milan finished in a scoreless draw.
The result lifts Juve to fifth in the table, just four points behind Parma and
Milan, who remain locked together on 21 points and equal goal difference after
10 matches.
Lazio are second on 19 points after struggling to a 2-1 victory over Cremonese
at Rome's Olympic stadium.

THE fortunes of these Lanarkshire rivals were summed up in this 90 minutes at
Firhill.
Airdrie have stuttered all season, but the three points have reawakened
ambitions of promotion while those above them are faltering.
Hamilton, however, now look candidates for relegation and are the only side in
Britain without a win to their credit.
Airdrie's Jimmy Sandison chose Saturday of all days to score his first goal for
the club in more than 100 appearances.
That it should also be the winner just emphasised to Hamilton the way their
season is running.
Yet, their former favourite Peter Duffield, now in the Airdrie colours, had
words of consolation for them later. ``Accies have been unlucky this season for
they have been playing good football. Unfortunately, they have not been scoring
enough goals.
``If they could get that first win, it would do so much for them.''
However, it was Duffield`s regular goals last season which propelled Accies to
a mid-table position and his loss is almost painful to see.
After only four minutes Duffield's strike was blocked by keeper Allan Ferguson,
but the rebound fell to Tony Smith, who opened the scoring. Four minutes later,
Hamilton were level when a Raymond McStay drive was deflected past keeper John
Martin.
But that second-half winner from Sandison, when he crashed a long-range effort
into the roof of the net, was two much for Hamilton.
Duffield also knows what Airdrie must do to make their presence felt. ``Our
passing and movement is good but we also need to turn that into more goals.
``However, we are now back in the promotion scene and our target must be to get
a run going. Every team is capable of beating each other in this league, and
the side which puts a run together can benefit. Raith Rovers showed that last
season.''
Certainly, Airdrie are only seven points behind leaders Dunfermline and at this
early stage of the season, and with three points for a win, that is very little.
However, the prospects for Hamilton are bleak, and manager Iain Munro summed
up: ``After a promising start, it was stupidity which cost us in the second
half. We did not deserve anything because of that.''

Dumbarton 1, Clydebank 2
JAMES Grady is a little man with big ambitions. And desperate to make up for
lost time, having come into football late.
Just two years out of Junior football, the 24-year-old midfielder scored his
sixth of the season on Saturday - and signalled that Clydebank is but a
platform for his talents.
He said: ``Clydebank gave me the break, but I hope to go further - as far as I
can - although I reckon a move will have to happen soon.''
Grady, who fears many managers think he's too small, insisted he is ``as good
in the air as anyone,'' and has goals from headers to prove it.
Against Dumbarton, his strike came from feet, and underlined stand-in 'keeper
Peter Dennison's inexperience. Grady sent the 17-year-old the wrong way with a
mere wiggle of the hips. It was Bankies' first shot on goal, after seven
minutes.
Dennison, in for the suspended Ian MacFarlane, played well, according to
Dumbarton manager Jim Fallon. But he will step up his hunt for a keeper this
week after failing to sign Henry Smith from Hearts and John Burridge from
Newcastle.
``It's not fair on the youngster to be stand-in,'' said Fallon.
He will also be working on a defence whose confidence is even lower than their
league position. ``It will be tightened through sheer hard work.''
Grady's goal apart, the first half was mind-numbingly dull, brightened only by
a spectacular sunset over Dumbarton Rock.
Ken Eadie's second for Clydebank after the interval turned the game with
Dumbarton at last stepping up a gear - albeit if only moving out of neutral. As
they chased the game, Bankies could have scored at least four more from
breakaways. Eadie's goal from 12 yards summed up Dumbarton's defensive woes. A
Garry Matthews punt upfield, Grady headed on, and Eadie was clear through after
James Marsland missed the ball.
A third in 61 minutes was refused for reasons no-one could fathom after Grady
rounded Dennison and his shot, off the bar, was hit home by Joe Robertson.
Martin Mooney pulled one back from a penalty in 67 minutes after Scott Murdoch
fouled substitute Stephen Dallas.
Manager Brian Wright noted his side play better away from home, perhaps because
the system - two wingers, and Eadie in the middle - is more suited to playing
on the break.
He added: ``It may not work as well at home, but we have to keep to a system.''

LABOUR MP George Galloway yesterday won his battle to be selected as the
party's candidate for the new Glasgow Kelvin seat.
The general committee of the constituency Labour party decided to put his name
forward as the sole nominee to contest the next General Election for an area
which includes Mr Galloway's Hillhead seat and part of Glasgow Central.
In doing so, the committee ignored the claims of Ms Shiona Waldron, who had
been put forward as an alternative candidate in a move which appeared to cause
serious divisions in the local party.
After a short debate yesterday, constituency chairman Mr Gerard Devaney said
members had voted 26-12 in a secret ballot in favour of the proposal to adopt
Mr Galloway.
The MP described the decision as ``very convincing'' and claimed it
demonstrated widespread support for him throughout the Labour movement.
However, the committee's rejection of the option of letting all constituency
members choose their candidate was criticised by Ms Waldron.
She said that of votes given by nominating branches and organisations within
the constituency, she had polled 91, against 97 for Mr Galloway.
Ms Waldron claimed that a two-way choice would have been more democratic and
more in keeping with the spirit of the party's one-member-one-vote philosophy.

JUST two weeks after the Royal Navy took its emotional leave of Rosyth, with
some of the fleet heading to the South of England, one of its frigates
yesterday made the trip the other way, bringing with it job opportunities for
workers in Fife.
HMS Coventry sailed from Plymouth to Rosyth Royal Dockyard where it will be the
first Type 22 vessel to undergo a refit there on a contract providing work for
around 150, and worth more than #10m.
Among its crew on the two-day journey were 22 ``guest'' sailors, including Mr
David Batty, managing director of Babcock Rosyth Defence, the operators of the
dockyard, and trade union representatives.
Also on board were dockyard employees who will work on the contract which was
won by Babcock Rosyth Defence in the face of competition from Devonport Royal
Dockyard.
Work on HMS Coventry is scheduled to last around 12 months on a package
including sonar systems overhauls, accommodation conversion, main machinery and
shafting overhaul, and enhancement of the internal communications system.
Mr Batty, who believed the firm's success was a testament to the skills and
flexibility of the workforce, said: ``We were able to win this contract due to
the lessons we have learned from previous surface ship refits.''

A UNIFORMED police officer stood guard outside a hospital ward in Glasgow
yesterday where a man was recovering after being shot several times outside an
Orange Hall.
Armed police surrounded all entrances to the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, after
the man was admitted with gunshot wounds on Saturday.
Mr Steven Young, 37, of Sighthill, Glasgow, was shot as he collected tickets at
the door of the hall for a ``pre-Old Firm'' match function in the Orange Halls
in Blackie Street, Yorkhill, Glasgow.
Police said Mr Young was approached by two men, one armed with a firearm, who
shot him several times.
He was taken to Western Infirmary and treated for gunshot wounds. His condition
was described as comfortable last night.
Detectives said yesterday that they had not yet established a ``clear motive''
for the attack. They said it was ``too early'' to comment on whether it was
perhaps sectarian-related or whether it was a vendetta against Mr Young.
Mr Jack Ramsey, secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, said he was
concerned at the shooting.
He was not aware of any serious incidents outside the hall in the past but
added that it was possible that the security of all Orange Halls would now have
to be reviewed.
The shooting follows another incident last March when two brothers were shot on
their way home from an Orange Hall in Sandbank Street, Maryhill, Glasgow. Mr
Allan MacDonald, 34, died and his brother, Iain, survived the the attack.
Charges of murder and attempted murder brought against Mr Angus Malavin, 32, of
Summerston, Glasgow, were found not proven at the High Court in Glasgow last
July.
He had lodged a special defence of alibi.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE.
FORMER Dundee and Nancy striker Ray Stephen has walked out on Cove Rangers
without explanation. Stephen, who signed a new two-year contract at Allan Park
just weeks ago, has not been in contact with manager Kenny Taylor since Cove's
disappointing Highland League Cup final defeat against Huntly on September 16.
It is not the first time the former Scotland A internationalist's time at Cove
has turned sour. He ended a six-year stint in France to join the Aberdeenshire
club and start a newsagent's business.
In September last year, he left the club to concentrate on his business because
he could not hold down a first-team place. The latest setback comes after a
new, slim-line Stephen made another big impact in his return to the club this
season.
Stephen's absence did not affect Cove on Saturday, as they defeated Deveronvale
4-0 to stay one point behind Huntly in the championship chase.
Huntly made heavy weather of their 2-0 win at bottom club Nairn, with Brian
Thomson scoring on the half-hour, and Gary Whyte putting matters beyond doubt
only in 87 minutes.

<RECORDNO>975290504</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
RAILTRACK has set aside more than #1000m of taxpayers' money to inflate its
profits artificially immediately after privatisation, it was claimed yesterday.
Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, called for a halt to all work on
Railtrack's privatisation - pencilled in for the spring - to provide time for a
full Stock Exchange investigation of the alleged scandal.
He claimed that the network of tracks, stations, and signals which Railtrack
manages is being starved of cash to benefit post-privatisation owners.
Mr Wilson said: ``The system is falling apart in many places, there is no
investment in new track or signalling, and an awful lot of maintenance is
falling behind, and this is where the money is going.
``I believe that this amounts to a systematic attempt to create an artificial
level of profitability for Railtrack in the period immediately following
privatisation.''
However, Railtrack insisted that all the money referred to had been set aside
for necessary future costs and that if the whole #1000m were spent immediately,
the entire rail system would grind to a halt as works were carried out
everywhere in the country.
Independent analysts found four items in the Railtrack accounts, published in
September, which are earmarked as 1994-95 expenditure but would result in
#1140m benefits to post-privatisation owners, said Mr Wilson.
He claimed that:
q #450m is set aside for ``property maintenance backlog accrual'', of which
only #18m will be spent this year.
q #403m of loans is being paid off this year with money that could have been
invested in improvements.
q #483m is earmarked for ``asset maintenance'' but is being underspent by #150m.
q #156m has been deducted to cover falls in the value of assets and any future
environmental liabilities.
Mr Wilson added: ``I believe that these revelations will contribute to the
mounting scepticism about Railtrack privatisation. It is clear not only that
the taxpayer is intended to feather their nest but also that the initial level
of profits which would be engineered could not be sustained thereafter.''
Railtrack rejected Mr Wilson's claims, pointing out that its accounts had been
fully audited and accepted as a ``true and fair view'' of its operations.
Before any flotation, strict Stock Exchange listing rules would have to be met
and sponsors Warburgs and Rothschilds would have to be satisfied that its
accounts and prospectus would pass all relevant scrutiny, said a spokesman.
He added: ``These sums are provisioned in the accounts for known future
obligations and it is good accounting practice to do this.
``The suggestion that Railtrack should be spending #1000m now on maintenance
and improvements would be physically impossible.
``If one were suddenly to commission that amount of work, it would mop up the
spare capacity in the contract market and push prices up, so it would not be
good value for money.
``It would also mean shutting down the rail network, because you would be
working on the tracks to such an extent that no trains would be able to run.''
Railtrack has spent #1500m on infrastructure improvements in the two years
since its creation and has thorough long-term plans for more renewal and
maintenance, he said.

FOUR people abducted from a house by bogus policemen were yesterday freed
unharmed.
The two men and two women were taken from the house at Mallusk, County Antrim,
on Saturday night, said the RUC. They were driven around for several hours
before being released uninjured near Lisburn.
Detectives said they had no idea what was the motive for the abduction but did
not believe it to be sectarian.
Two men dressed as RUC officers had called at the house and asked for the male
occupant by name. When he appeared, several other men entered the house and the
two couples were handcuffed and taken to a waiting car.
Meanwhile, a 23-year-old man was in hospital in Belfast yesterday suffering
from broken legs after being set upon by a masked gang in the republican west
of the city during the night.
The RUC said the man was walking down the Suffolk Road when he was dragged into
an alley by the gang and beaten with iron bars in what appeared to be a
republican punishment attack.
Both the man's legs were broken and he suffered other injuries to the body. His
condition was said to be satisfactory.
In Armagh, an elderly woman was rescued from her home by the emergency services
after arsonists set fire to it.
The woman was led to safety by police as firemen tackled the blaze, which
started in the hallway.
In Magherafelt, County Londonderry, three men were arrested following a knife
attack in the town centre early yesterday. The victim was detained in hospital
with leg injuries.

Morton 0, St Mirren 3
THINGS happen slowly in Renfrewshire. It is not the most excitable of counties.
If the earth seldom moves there, at Cappielow it tilted more than somewhat.
While Morton looked edgy on the high ground they have become accustomed to
occupy, St Mirren leapt out of the deepish hole they have been in.
In this topsy-turvy world, however, the entertainment stayed top class. As a
local spectacle, the match was grand.
Partly, it was the crowd of better than 6000 that created a sense of occasion.
St Mirren's travelling fans - maybe 2500 of them - seemed to have sensed that
something good was coming their way. Perhaps ahead of the players they had
sniffed a change.
They have watched their team improve by inches with good draws. Clambering all
over Morton - always an especially sweet success - was a fast lift in more than
one way.
Morale in the Morton camp was dented, not destroyed. Their supporters looked
more bemused than anything. On their last trip to Paisley, the Greenock
visitors knocked about some of the stadium furniture. This time they watched
the legs come off the players.
After the interval, Morton collapsed like a set of DIY chairs. What ailed them
was to have a bad day on exactly the wrong day - their first game without Derek
McInnes, who has been bought by Rangers.
The sense of frailty, which they thought they had got over, reappeared.
Morton's back four were at sixes and sevens. They were static and insecure.
Peter Cormack caught the bug so badly he was ordered off near the end.
Although he raised a hand, there seemed no harm in it. Another marginal
decision (there were six other little bookings) was an offside verdict when
Derek Collins had the ball in the net after quarter of an hour. Marko Rajamaki
was eclipsed by Paul McIntyre, while Brian McLaughlin put the hems on Warren
Hawke as St Mirren asserted control of the contest.
Their early game of short, choppy passes steadily moved into a swinging rhythm
that pivoted on the cool pillar of Paul Fenwick.
Derek Scrimgour, the under-18 Scotland goalkeeper, showed all round composure,
diving bravely at Hawke's feet and calmly fielding a free kick by Rajamaki.
With a goal in each half, Mark Yardley further sharpened his deadly pairing
with Barry Lavety, who scored between Yardley's efforts with an acrobatic
volley.
While St Mirren need more points, and soonest, Morton's urgent requirement is
to resharpen their appetite. Opportunity knocks for both, with St Mirren next
at home to Hamilton and Morton away at Dunfermline.

THE number of staff employed in social work departments around Scotland
increased by 5% in 1994, according to figures released today.
Welcoming the rise, Scottish Social Work Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
said it reflected the new responsibilities placed on local authorities by the
NHS and Community Care Act.
The Minister said the greatest increase of staff was in management, fieldwork,
and special location staff, including those responsible for community care
assessments, as well as social workers in prison units and psychiatric
hospitals.
``Social workers do a crucial job protecting and caring for vulnerable people
and I am pleased their numbers have increased as demands on them have grown,''
he added.
The number of staff grew from 37,349 in 1993 to 39,100 in 1994, with part-time
staff accounting for 40% of the total.
Meanwhile, health inequality will be discussed at a major conference being held
in Edinburgh today, writes Raymond Duncan.
The conference, promoted jointly by Lothian Health Board, the regional council,
and the voluntary sector, aims to encourage the new unitary councils to develop
health strategies based on a partnership approach.
More than 150 delegates will attend the conference, which will be chaired by Dr
David Player, chairman of Public Health Alliance UK and a former director of
the Scottish Health Education Group.

<HEADLINE>Thistle are still in tune with that Lambie true grit Frustration at Falkirk for former Firhill chief</HEADLINE>

HE was in the Falkirk dug-out, but John Lambie knew how the gang in the other
one were feeling. The team he steered through many a sterling battle were
brandishing their lances, girding themselves in the armour, and defying the
baddies, as they did so many times when he was in charge at Firhill.
Thistle were in one of their determined modes, the one that can be described as
mulish.
When they ain't in the mood to lose, they ain't gonna lose.
It is an attitude all too familiar to Lambie who epitomised it when he was
cajoling, bullying, and willing them to retain their place in the premier
division at a time when they had no real right to claim it.
Now he had to stand (does anybody sit there nowadays?) in the dug-out, puff his
cigar, and watch the defiance that he had nurtured endure over his new team.
Lambie knew in his heart what was going to happen. He said as much: ``I could
see we were not in the right frame of mind from the word go.
``They were up for it, we weren't. I knew Thistle would come here to make a
right game of it, but our players were just not ready for it.
``Last week, when they beat Hibs, they were buzzing, making passes, biting, and
scratching. Today they were nothing. It is a funny, funny game.''
Lambie looked at the clash between these sides at the bottom of the premier
division as crucial, what he called a ``six-pointer,'' and his disappointment
was not difficult to detect. His successor at Firhill, Murdo MacLeod, has not
taken long to suss out the psychology that Lambie had used to maintain a
presence in the top division with what is a relatively ordinary side.
He may have arrived with long-term plans to spark a revolution in Maryhill, but
he has soon discovered that, in the meantime, the workers will have to get on
with the job.
Thistle always looked the hungrier team, the one that realised the need to
scrap for every scrap, make sure the other lot don't get the ball first, and
once they understand what you are about, hit them with some decent football. It
is the classic relegation defying strategy, gleaned over seasons of experience.
``We got a lift from the way we worked and played against Celtic last week,
even if we lost,'' said MacLeod, ``and the players carried that on against
Falkirk.
``I thought we dominated the first half, although we didn't create much, but
the second half was maybe better for the spectators, as it was more exciting.''
He was right on all counts. The first half did belong to Thistle, but nothing
happened with a depressing regularity. The action after the break was more in
keeping with the Brockville norm. Both sides attacked, made mistakes, did some
nice things, annoyed the referee, incensed the crowd. We all perked up.
Wayne Foster hit a superb curling right-foot shot past Tony Parks for the goal
that mattered, and Falkirk went hurtling at Thistle for the last 20 minutes
when even Mo Johnston missed a great chance.
Mo had laid on a ``goal'' for his colleague, Scott McKenzie, earlier, but the
referee had called for a free kick on his behalf before the ball hit the net.
The Falkirk players were furious, understandably. The advantage rule was
designed precisely for such eventualities.
Still, they never really deserved to share the points with a Partick side in
which Tommy Turner was outstanding.
MacLeod, who failed in attempts to buy Malcolm Mackay of Celtic and Scott
Leitch of Hearts, will try again to find new players. If he gets a defender, he
will let Steve Welsh, who had a fine game, leave for Dunfermline or Lincoln
City.
For Thistle, the trick is to find back-up players who at least are as capable
of giving their all on a weekly basis as the current cast. The likes of Alan
Dinnie, Derek McWilliams and Steve Pittman have been over the course often
enough to know instinctively what is required when the club needs points,
rather than plaudits.
All of them played well at Brockville, but it was Turner who led the band, with
an impressive passing display in midfield. With MacLeod expressing his pleasure
in the emergence of young players like Stephen Docherty, the mood at Firhill is
upbeat, even if the road ahead will be mileposted with relegation tussles.
The Falkirk attempt at a come-back in the second half could have been strangled
at birth if Thistle had been a little more fortunate shortly after the break.
Turner, out on the right, was the man who laid the ball into the path of
McWilliams and his fierce shot hit the bar with Parks well beaten. That,
followed by Foster's goal would have been more than enough to seal the points.
Falkirk did come back with lots of energy and will, and time and again they
invaded the Thistle penalty area. Partick have been well schooled in the art of
defying sieges, however, and they kept their heads, held their discipline, and
refused to buckle.
Typical Thistle? Maybe so, but as others are going to discover, it is very
effective.
As for Falkirk and Lambie, the manager is also working hard to bring another
midfield player to Brockville. Busy times are ahead in the lower regions.

THE stalled UK-Irish summit could take place as early as this week, after the
Prime Minister's efforts to restart the peace process with proposals to break
the deadlock over IRA arms.
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton is understood to be keen to meet Mr Major
before the arrival of President Bill Clinton in the UK next week on the eve of
his visit to Northern Ireland.
With the Budget being announced next Tuesday and the Irish divorce referendum
on Friday, this coming week is considered the best option available to the two
men, who have made it clear their willingness to search for solutions to the
obstacles which have left the Ulster peace efforts bogged down in
recriminations.
Mr Major's fresh proposals are being considered by the Irish Government in
advance of telephone discussions between the two leaders in the next few days,
although Dublin has signalled caution over what Mr Major is suggesting. The
proposals, understood to be a reworking of the ``twin-track'' approach first
suggested in September, include a possible date for the start of all-party
talks.
Mr Major has proposed the creation of an independent commission with a strong
international element to examine the question of arms decommissioning, while
all political parties in Northern Ireland begin preparatory talks that could
lead to formal negotiations.
However, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams last night urged the Prime Minister to
name a date for the start of all-party talks. Mr Adams said he did not know
what the new British plans were.
However, he added: ``It is clear that if we are to re-establish the peace
process we need a date for the commencement of peace talks without
preconditions, as was promised by both Governments prior to the IRA cessation.''
He warned that ``any proposals which retain the British demand for a surrender
of IRA weapons as a precondition to all party talks are unworkable''.
Dialogue and agreement threatened no-one, he said.
Sinn Fein has refused to accept Britain's insistence that the IRA must first
give up its arms as a sign of good faith, despite the refusal of the Unionists
to participate in talks with Sinn Fein unless decommissioning takes place.
The peace process broke down in September when the Irish Government abruptly
cancelled the UK-Irish summit after Sinn Fein warned that the British proposals
were unacceptable because of their commitment to decommissioning.
Last week, Mr Bruton appeared to increase the obstacles by calling on Mr Major
to move swiftly to all-party talks while on a visit to London.
Mr Major's initiative is seen as an attempt to move away from recent
confrontations and return to the progress made over the summer. However,
Government sources have maintained that there are no reasons for ``Sinn Fein to
block the peace process''.
Mr Clinton's visit is considered crucial to the peace talks by nationalist
politicians, who hope he will bring pressure to bear on the UK to accept
all-party talks.
His visit had originally been intended to set an American seal on peace talks
but, with no progress to report, observers fear it might turn into a lost
opportunity. In addition, the continuing American budget crisis threatens a
last-minute cancellation of the visit.
SDLP leader John Hume, denying rumours that he is considering standing down as
an MP on health grounds, yesterday called on Unionists to agree to all-party
talks. ``The Unionist Party must take its own decisions but must, like the rest
of us, face political reality.''
At his party's annual conference, he again challenged Britain to set a date for
the start of the dialogue process. ``We cannot move forward at all without
dialogue,'' he said. ``It is not asking too much of the British Government to
make it their urgent priority.''
However, Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis rejected Mr Hume's challenge, saying
his address to the SDLP's conference was ``nothing more than a pompous lecture
from a politician who has run out of ideas''.
Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, said there was ``no
possibility'' of the IRA getting rid of its weapons as a precondition to
entering all-party talks. ``We wish to be part of a process which removes all
of the guns from Irish politics,'' he said.
``It has become quite clear to us in recent months that the British Government
appears only to be interested in removing the IRA guns and that is not good
enough. Everybody knows, including the British Government, that there is no
possibility of that happening,'' he told BBC television.

THIRD DIVISION.
FUNNY how things change. Up to three weeks ago, Livingston boasted the only
unbeaten league record in Scotland. Now, they are one of only three teams in
the country still to win at their home ground.
The table-toppers had, of course, recorded a few victories at Meadowbank, but
after two outings at their new Almondvale Stadium, they have still to reward a
large and enthusiastic local support.
Local MP Robin Cook performed the official opening on Saturday, but Livingston
were to pay dearly for missed chances. Like East Stirlingshire, who drew at
Almondvale the previous week, the visitors were not content to make up the
numbers.
Cowdenbeath substitute Kevin Bowmaker was the party-pooper in chief, his cute
lob in injury time making it a disappointing day for Jim Leishman's team.
They were even denied an attendance record, the 3883 at Livingston being
surpassed by a new top mark for the division of 4288, who saw Jamie MacPherson
hit a double and give Ross County a victory by 2-0 over Caley Thistle at
Dingwall which takes them to within four points of the leaders.
Queen's Park were a little flattered by the 4-1 home win over Albion Rovers,
whose keeper, Marc Osborne, failed to turn up.
Peter Dwyer's double helped 'Shire win 3-1 at Alloa, and Brechin drew their
Angus derby 1-1 at Arbroath.

St Johnstone 1, Dunfermline 0
ALAN Main's luck has changed - and it's not a moment too soon for the St
Johnstone keeper. He proved it on Saturday at McDiarmid Park with an inspired
display that broke the hearts of first-division leaders Dunfermline - and sent
confidence soaring through the Saints team.
After the match, Main admitted that he had not exactly been a pin-up player
with the fans since signing in January of this year from Dundee United.
But everything seems to be clicking into place since a penalty save at
Dumbarton at the beginning of this month. He said: ``I saved that spot kick,
and we raced up the field and scored. I had a shut-out last week, and another
one today. I'm feeling much happier about my form.''
Efforts from David Bingham, Ryan Hegarty, Marc Millar, and Stewart Petrie that
you would have bet on to hit the back of the net, were blocked by Main.
It would have given the Fifers a point their second- half pressure merited. It
would also have spoiled Saints manager Paul Sturrock's record of watching his
side notch three successive league victories since he took over a couple of
seasons ago.
He said afterwards: ``The most pleasing aspect for me was that the three
teenagers we have brought in were still on the field at the end. I don't think
any of them let themselves down today, and I think we are going in the right
direction.''
Saints' goal came from striker Kevin Twaddle - a real handful for a Dunfermline
defence weakened by injury - when he ran through on a Philip Scott headed pass
to slot the ball behind Guido van de Kamp. Twaddle, however, had to be
substituted near the end because of ``a migraine and blurred vision.''
Dunfermline manager Bert Paton, with nine first-team regulars sidelined, also
had to call in some youngsters - with former Dundee United striker Hegarty,
nephew of Paul and son of Kevin, looking a real prospect.
John Fraser of Oakley United and Stephen Ferguson of Rosyth Juniors were the
other two drafted into the squad. Paton said: ``Hegarty got the nod because he
was the oldest at 19.''
However, despite a run of indifferent results - only one win in their past four
league games - the Fifers amazingly are still a point ahead at the top.
``They're having bother killing us,'' Paton joked, as he added the good news
that five of his first-team squad should be fit for next week.

A HIGHLAND murder case ``could be blown wide open'' by new evidence, according
to the lawyer acting for the man who has served 10 years for the crime.
George MacPhee was convicted of murdering 36-year-old Elizabeth Sutherland at
her home in the Black Isle village of Culbokie in 1984.
Now Paisley lawyer Gordon Ritchie claims that evidence could implicate someone
else.
Mr Ritchie said yesterday he expects to lodge an application for an appeal
``within the next year''.
Earlier this month, a Channel Four Trial and Error documentary alleged 29
discrepancies in the evidence of prosecution witness, Mr Colin Hawkins, who was
MacPhee's companion on the day of the murder.
Yesterday, a Sunday newspaper revealed that Mr Hawkins has retracted that
evidence in a statement which he has given to Mr Ritchie.
In the statement, he claims he was put under enormous pressure by Northern
Constabulary police investigating the murder.
Mr Hawkins now claims they told him he would be charged with the crime if he
did not sign a statement which implicated MacPhee.
After his arrest, MacPhee claimed to have been in Dundonnell, 90-minute's drive
from Culbokie, with Mr Hawkins, on the day of the murder.
However, when the case came to trial Mr Hawkins testified that they had both
been in Culbokie and that he had watched MacPhee enter Elizabeth Sutherland's
house.
Mr Hawkins now says he gave false testimony which ensured that MacPhee was
convicted.
Yesterday, Mr Ritchie said: ``Hawkins would have said anything to end the
treatment he was given by the police. He was not subjected to violence but to
emotional and psychological blackmail.
``He was held for an unnecessary length of time and put under undue pressure to
testify against MacPhee.
Mr Ritchie added: ``It may be that the evidence which I am collecting to prove
my client's innocence could point the finger at the true murderer, who I
believe is still at large.
``I am confident we will be able to gather enough evidence to make a strong
case for an appeal.
``There is always strong resistance from the legal establishment in such cases
as you are seeking to prove that the police acted inappropriately.
Yesterday, MacPhee, who is currently in Full Sutton jail in York, was said to
be very pleased at Mr Hawkins's new statement.
However, police still believe he is guilty, despite the allegations made in the
documentary and Mr Hawkins's retraction.

Jenin, Sunday
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat told thousands of cheering Palestinians today they
had been ``liberated'' under a peace deal with Israel which no assassin's
bullet could kill.
Protected by hundreds of bodyguards, Arafat addressed crowds then chaired a
cabinet meeting of his Palestinian Authority during a four-hour visit to Jenin,
only his third trip to the West Bank since self-rule began in Gaza and Jericho.
Security was heavy following the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish gunman opposed to PLO peace earlier this month.
``The peace process goes on. Nobody will be an obstacle, especially those who
use their guns for assassination,'' Arafat said.
``My brothers, this is the peace movement in the land of prophesy and so we
should put our hands together in order to build the Palestinian state,'' Arafat
said from a platform overlooking the crowd.
``In the name of God, in the name of the Palestinian people, I declare Jenin
liberated, liberated, liberated,'' he said.
Israeli soldiers pulled out of the centre of Jenin last week as part of an
agreement extending limited autonomy from the Gaza Strip and West Bank enclave
of Jericho. Five more cities and part of Hebron are to be evacuated soon to
allow for Palestinian elections on January 20.
Meanwhile, Israel's secret service, under fire for failing to prevent
assassination, faced more damage to its reputation over reports a Jewish
extremist who knew the killer had been its informer.
Israeli newspapers quoted an Israeli journalist and a right-wing rabbi as
saying Avishai Raviv, head of the shadowy Eyal group, passed information to the
Shin Bet agency as an informer known as ``Champagne'' for the past two years.
Raviv, who has denied knowing of plans to kill Rabin, also denied the
allegation he was an informer through his lawyer. The lawyer confirmed Raviv
had known confessed assassin Yigal Amir.
Israeli political analysts said the reports pointed up Shin Bet incompetence
but did not implicate it in Rabin's killing.
Israel also cracked down today on Jewish extremists. The cabinet agreed to ban
subversive Jewish groups, speed up the prosecution of members, and bar
supporters abroad from entering Israel, officials said.
The anti-Arab Kach and Kahane Hai (Kahane Lives) groups are already outlawed
but still operate in Israel and have supporters in the United States.
The groups, like Rabin's 25-year-old assassin Yigal Amir, oppose Israel's
agreement with the PLO.
The United States also forged ahead on the toughest track of the peace process
today - stalled negotiations between Israel and Syria, sending peace envoy
Dennis Ross for talks with Acting Prime Minister Shimon Peres in Jerusalem.
Ross goes on to Damascus in an attempt to restart talks on the return of the
captured Golan Heights to Syria in exchange for peace. - Reuter

<RECORDNO>975290514</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Western Isles MP, Mr Calum Macdonald, will today try to break the deadlock
in a dispute that has flared up at the Arnish oil yard in Lewis.
The 305 workers were sacked on Friday.
Last night, Mr Macdonald said: ``I hope to meet with both sides. We need to get
back to where people are talking and not taking action of a precipitated nature.
``This kind of dispute is potentially disastrous for the company, their
workforce, the families, and the islands.''
The entire shop floor staff was dismissed by Lewis Offshore Ltd after beginning
an overtime ban for higher wages on Thursday. After management claimed the
men's action was ``illegal'', the workers confirmed there was no official
ballot.
``All the men decided individually to work to their contract. So there was no
strike nor any industrial action,'' said Mr John Naan, spokesman for the
workers, who meet today.
He added: ``On Friday morning, we were all called a bunch of sheep who would
come running back for our jobs in a couple of days by the production manager,
Mr Abraham Bot.
``The boys were furious about that but the bosses are about to find out that
the sheep are now battering rams and wolves.''
Meanwhile, a letter from yard management offers reinstatement on new terms. The
men must not only agree to forgo any pay rises until April 1 but also to new
hours and conditions. ``We have been told that means no paid lunch breaks, tea
breaks or even compassionate time off,'' said one sacked worker.
No-one from the management was available for comment.

THE much-anticipated new Beatles song - the first since they split 25 years ago
and featuring the voice of the late John Lennon - was aired for the first time
this morning.
Free as a Bird was written by Lennon and recorded by him in 1977, three years
before he was murdered outside his New York home by a fan.
A recording of the song was completed as the first new Beatles output by the
group's survivors Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr after
Lennon's widow Yoko Ono gave her permission.
The album on which it is included will be distributed to shops, with some
opening at midnight tonight to sell copies to eager fans.
The single itself will go on sale on December 4 - making it an almost certain
Christmas No 1.
Free as a Bird will be heard by ITV audiences tonight in a half-hour
documentary, The Beatles: All Together Now.
Anthology - the title of the album - is also the title of a six-hour
documentary series to be screened on ITV later this month, made after producers
were allowed unprecedented access to previously unseen archive material.
Sales of the music and the documentary are expected to generate millions of
pounds.

BIGGAR set themselves up for a dramatic conclusion to division three of the
Tennent's premier league after defeating leaders Glasgow Academicals at Hartree
Mill yesterday. Their victory yesterday, and the defeat of rivals Kirkcaldy by
Peebles, has given Biggar the chance to win promotion along with Glasgow
Academicals, who, unless they lose by some unthinkable margin next Saturday,
will be confirmed as champions.
What Biggar must do to elevate themselves is to take at least one championship
point from their match next week with Corstorphine at Union Park. And on this
evidence, they should have little difficulty in attaining their goal.
In the forwards, it was New Zealander Simon Read who did much of the damage.
The burly No.8 frequently made dents in the defence and often required four or
five Academicals to halt his rampaging runs. Yet for much of the game it seemed
that the result would depend on goal-kicking skill, Calum MacGregor (2) and
Jeremy Hart supplying nine points for Academicals and Denis Lavery, with three
goals, countering for Biggar.
The drama, however, was reserved until the last quarter and it was Academicals
who made the first thrust.
Biggar's full back Stuart Harrison misjudged a high kick from Academicals
stand-off Calum MacGregor and when the ball fell kindly into the hands of
centre Jeremy Hart, a try was inevitable. MacGregor added the conversion for a
16-9 lead but Biggar made light of this setback.
From a penalty move, Biggar moved the ball left for Harrison to squeeze in at
the corner for an unconverted try and with five minutes of playing time
remaining, Read set up second-phase ball with a bull-like run. Biggar moved the
ball to left wing Lindsay Steele, who raced over on the overlap for a try to
put his side ahead 19-16.
Academicals had a chance to rescue themselves from defeat but Hart's long-range
penalty attempt drifted wide.
Biggar - S Harrison; G Watson, L Graham, D Lavery, L Steele; R Young, N
Abernethy; D Fleming, A Yates, T Young, R McAlpine, J King, A Harvey, S Read, E
McAlpine.
Glasgow Academicals - J Mason; T Matthewson, J Hart, M Davis, D Ablett; C
MacGregor, S Simmers; A Perry, D Porter, G Doran, C Afuakwah, S Begley, D Barr,
S Winter. Replacement - I McAslan for Mason.
Referee - J Smith (Edinburgh Northern).
SCORERS: Biggar - Lavery, 3p; Harrison, 1t; L Steele, 1t. Glasgow Academicals -

THIS time the Tories must get it right; I mean their Budget in eight days'
time. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke knows it, and so does his challenger Gordon
Brown. It was the Chancellor himself who observed last summer that he would
know, within six months of his Budget, whether the Tories had a ``serious''
chance at the next election.
His Shadow, Brown, has now pushed Labour policy beyond the stance of merely not
increasing taxes. He promises that a Labour government will be better at
cutting taxes than another Tory one. Of course, he adds the ``when affordable''
qualification, just like Clarke.
Labour now tells us that it is looking for a bottom rate of direct tax of 10p
to 15p in the pound. This is the best way to get people, particularly the
young, out of unemployment and into real jobs. It is not entirely a new idea.
As I recall, Enoch Powell thought 3p in the pound would be better.
It is reported that there was a row in Shadow Cabinet when Brown made his
presentation on Labour strategy for the Queen's Speech and the Budget. I don't
believe that, and not just because the new Labour Chief Whip, Donald Dewar, who
was present, denies a row. The Shadow Cabinet does not have rows any more. It
merely blinks and swallows hard, particularly when cutting welfare benefits is
being proposed. In these circumstances, the Shadow Cabinet has a ``discussion''.
Brown, me must note, claims that reducing bottom tax rates - and not just
increasing tax allowances - will force people out of the poverty and benefits
trap. The tax take will increase as the colossal benefits bill reduces. His tax
cuts will be fairer and self-financing.
Whatever we think about all this, we have to observe that Brown is carrying out
a neat flanking movement against the Chancellor. For one thing, he is stating
that he will cut taxation for sound economic reasons, while the Chancellor's
Budget cuts (if there are any) are being done for mere short-term political
popularity. In the Budget debate, Brown intends to have an alternative taxation
policy to present.
His short-term kick start for employment will come from an immediate
``windfall'' tax on the public utilities to provide more training and
incentives to firms who take on more workers. This, he argues, will have an
instant effect while, over a longer term, the money saved from benefits can be
re-directed.
No need for further cuts in public expenditure, beyond what the Tories are
already trying to do. No need for additional tax burdens on the middle classes.
No need, perhaps, even to increase the top rate of income tax from 40% to 50%.
This is not just another turn-around in Labour thinking on taxation, it is a
genuinely historic breakthrough.
If the voters believe it, the Tories are well and truly scuppered at the next
election. Already, as Blair improves his ratings in public opinion polls, the
Tories are alarmed that the voters at the next election will be asked to choose
between two ``Tory'' economic policies; and they might as well give the
freshest ``Tories'' a chance.
We have seen how the Government, in a rather cack-handed way, has tried to
establish ``clear blue water'' between it and Blair in last week's legislative
programme for the new session of Parliament. Now we have Brown trying to
establish - what shall we call it? - ``clear red water'' between Labour and the
Tories. The line is that Labour won't tax you any more, it will just be more
effective and more fair.
This is a pretty good line to take, providing of course the old Labour elements
don't rebel at what is going on. It puts Clarke on his mettle for Budget day,
November 28. Brown will promise more precise detail in a General Election
manifesto, but last week's Shadow Cabinet agreed the strategy (despite a bit of
``discussion''). It is enough to be going on with. When the Tories challenge
Brown to say what he would do, he can now respond more credibly.
So we have a distinct watershed in British politics as we approach a decision
about which party is going to take us into the millennium. Whatever the
Chancellor provides on this coming Budget day, the Tories have to pick it up
and run with it. The slightest dissent at Westminster will be disastrous. For
example, those Tory MPs threatening rebellion if they don't get relief for the
housing market could be the downfall of their Government.
Clarke has two advantages over Labour, which now agrees with him that he must
be prudent and not upset the international markets. He will have the best
up-to-date figures on the state of the economy and his Treasury can present
them in such a way as to carry City conviction. He is in power, and Brown is
not, so he can actually do what he thinks is best for the country and his
party. Brown can only talk about it.
The Chancellor is also in a position to weigh up the chief tactical dilemma in
politics: should the Tories concentrate on pleasing their own voters at the
expense, if necessary, of all others? This is the main difference between
playing it safe and ultra prudent and, as some Ministers put it, going for
broke. Also, it could be the difference between just losing the next election
and losing it disastrously.
This in turn is the difference between losing power to Labour for five years or
15. A lot of Tory thought is going into this dilemma, some of it altruistic,
but much of it directed at avoiding political disaster within the next 18
months. Only the Prime Minister and his Chancellor can resolve it.
If the Budget flops, there will be no chance of ``smoking out'' Labour next
year. Brown has seen to that.

CALEDONIAN MacBrayne is to be asked to reconsider its decision to make ferries
from the mainland to Dunoon and Rothesay ``dry'' areas from next month.
The prospect of a cup of tea, a scone, or stronger refreshment is to be denied
commuters and tourists following the axeing of catering services as part of a
cost-cutting exercise.
The move comes at a time when the company has been increasing sailings on both
the Gourock/Dunoon and Wemyss Bay/Rothesay routes in a bid to attract more
traffic, particularly during the summer months.
Scrapping of the catering services is concerning Bute hoteliers who have been
campaigning for improved facilities on the Clyde ferries.
Mrs Peggy Ellis, of the Ardyne Hotel, said yesterday: ``Some people travel many
miles to the ferry terminal expecting to get a cup of coffee and a sandwich on
board. The company's sales may be down but that's no reason to give up. We
shall be writing to the directors of CalMac to ask them to reconsider this
decision.''
Argyll and Bute district councillor Gordon Mason said: ``I know many people on
Bute who will be disappointed, especially those who use the first boat in the
morning and depend on catering services for their breakfast. As a member of the
Bute Transport Users' Group, I will ensure that we take this up with the ferry
company.''
The decision to abandon the integrated cafeteria and bar service affects three
CalMac ferries, the Juno, Jupiter, and Saturn, which share rosters on the
crossings to Dunoon and Rothesay. It is likely to lead to the loss of 16 jobs.
The move also effectively ends a time-honoured tradition of refreshments being
available on steamers and ferries to the ``Doon the Watter'' resorts. As yet,
there is no firm indication as to whether vending machines will take over from
redundant stewards and tea-room assistants.
Mr Iain Russell, CalMac's personnel manager, said catering trade losses had led
to the closure of on-board catering services and the redundancies.
He added: ``Redundancies will take effect on December 15 following a 30-day
consultation period which the company has willingly entered into with the trade
unions.''
Mr Steve Todd, area organiser for the RMT union, said: ``We are still talking
to management in a bid to alleviate the situation and get the best financial
package for those affected by the closure announcement.''
He added that no details had yet been released as to who would carry out
cleaning duties on the ferries and the union had severe reservations about this.

IRISH trainer Eddie O'Grady has had many leading successes with runners in this
country.
He landed the First National Bank Gold Cup at Ascot with Sound Man, while
closer to home O'Grady took the feature Grade Two Troytown Chase at Navan with
Gimme Five.
He seldom has runners in this country outwith the top meetings so, with this in
mind, O'Grady's saddling of Catwalker in the seller at Catterick this afternoon
should not be overlooked.
Catwalker, to be ridden by Richard Dunwoody, won on the Flat as a two-year-old
but is still a maiden over hurdles after 11 starts in Ireland, where there are
no selling hurdles.
On his most recent outing he finished third in a handicap at Clonmel carrying
just 10st, but has to shoulder top-weight of 12st today.
q ADRIAN Maguire's attempt to gain ground in the jockeys' title race has been
dented with the discovery that the rider has cracked a bone just above an ankle
after a fall from Hatcham Boy in a novice hurdle at Ascot on Friday.
Maguire is likely to be out of action for three to four weeks.
He is currently fifth in the jockeys' table with 29 winners - 45 behind leader
Tony McCoy. And after his latest injury, Maguire's price for the championship
has been pushed out from 4-1 to 12-1.
However, Maguire is not the only rider forced to take it easy these days, for
conditional Richard Johnson faces up to a fortnight on the sidelines after a
fall at Towcester.
``They say he'll be out for between 10 days and two weeks,'' said agent Dave
Roberts. ``He has chipped a bone in a shoulder but it is a clean break and
nothing serious.''
Johnson's injury came when he fell at the first flight of the seller on Lord
Glenvara.
Runner-up in last season's amateur riders' championship, Johnson turned
professional last weekend and is attached to David Nicholson's stable.
q MORCELI was said to be in ``A1'' condition yesterday following a fall at
Ascot.
``It was quite a nasty fall but he looks to have come back fine,'' said a
spokeswoman for trainer Howard Johnson.
``He has a very slight graze - it hasn't even broken the skin - otherwise he is
A1. He got back late last night and bounced off the lorry - he wasn't at all
stiff or sorry for himself and he got straight into his food.''
Morceli was a close second behind Sound Man in the feature race at Ascot when
he came to grief at the twelfth fence.

THE Citizens' Theatre production of Irvine Welsh's novel, Trainspotting, was
named as best new play at the Theatre Management Association regional theatre
awards in Birmingham, yesterday.
Adapter Harry Gibson, who is ill and was unable to attend the ceremony, said
later: ``This is tremendously encouraging. It shows that regional theatres can
take work to London, rather than the other way around.''
Trainspotting opens at the Ambassador's, in London, on December 11, before
embarking on a five-month tour which will include dates as part of Mayfest in
Glasgow. Gibson's next project is an adaptation of Welsh's subsequent novel,
Maribou Stork Nightmares, which opens at the Citizens' in March.
Perth Theatre, in its diamond jubilee year, was named at the awards as the UK's
most welcoming venue. It comes at the end of a year of mixed fortunes, in which
the theatre lost its artistic director but won general praise for its
small-scale touring production of Alexander Gelman's A Man With Connections.
Accepting the award, theatre manager Paul McLennan said: ``We have had 60 years
to work at this.'' He added that the venue saw a visit to the theatre as a
complete experience for patrons, whether 16 or 60.
Anthony Sher was named as best actor for his performance in the title role of
Titus Andronicus in a co-production by the Market Theatre, Johannesburg, the
Royal National Theatre Studio, and West Yorkshire Playhouse. The show also won
best overall production.
Best actress was Kelly Hunter for Rosalind in As You Like It, for English
Touring Theatre. Best director was Barry Rutter for The Cracked Pot and A
Midsummer Night's Dream. The musical award went to Moll Flanders at the Theatre
Royal, York.
Other Scots nominees were Communicado's Tall Tales for Small People, for best
show for young people; Karen Tennent for best designer, for Communicado's A
Place with the Pigs; and 7:84 Theatre Company Scotland, for Stephen Greenhorn's
The Salt Wound, as best touring show.
The award ceremony followed the TMA's annual conference, where concerns were
expressed about the organisation's future. Members are to be asked to consider
funding an autonomous administration for the association, which at present
shares personnel with the Society of London Theatres.

A FORMER welder, branded ``The Raider of the Lost Titles'' for spotting
lucrative loopholes in Scottish property documents, has struck once again.
Londoner Brian Hamilton is poised to reap an estimated #100,000 from the rump
of an old Scottish estate after taking advantage of a law thought to have been
abolished in 1914.
Two years ago, he grossed almost #500,000 from the remains of another Scottish
estate once owned by the Dukes of Richmond and Gordon.
The discovery of little-known ``casualty clauses'' in the deeds of 25
Lanarkshire properties has caused embarrassment in Scottish legal circles.
As many as 17 solicitors either failed to notice or act upon these clauses to
prevent future losses to their clients.
Now homeowners in the former mining villages of Boghead and Kirkmuirhill face
payments of up to #12,000. A retired prison governor said yesterday he doubts
he will be able to sell his home until changes are agreed in his deeds.
However, the costs of compensation are likely to be met in the majority of
cases by solicitors' professional insurance policies. The flood of demands,
court action, and phone calls from Mr Hamilton or his solictors has shattered
the peace of mind of residents in the two villages.
Unable to pay the demands on their #38,000 two-bedroom cottage, Fiona and
Hunter Fairley are suffering more than most. The solicitor who acted for them
when they took on the remains of a 999-year lease two years ago has washed his
hands of their case, they claim.
After resigning, he failed to forward case papers to a new solicitor who took
over in May. Until last week, the first solicitor had still not told his
insurers, and the Law Society of Scotland was powerless to act officially.
The interest on the Fairley's original sum has been mounting daily at building
society rates.
``We are due about #8500 and it is going up all the time. We just do not have
the money. Sheriff officers have been round to value the contents of our
home.'' said Mrs Fairley.
Under the terms of the leases granted as early as 1815, every time a lease
changed hands on the estate a payment of one year's rent was due to the
landlord. Current tenants are responsible for any unpaid payments going back 20
years.
The Arlott family, who built their own three-bedroom bungalow in 1988 have
discovered part of their home stands on estate grounds, for which they have
also received a demand.
Mr Thomas Arlott, an electrical fitter, and his wife Jane, a primary school
secretary, are disputing the demand and are due to defend a court action
brought by the landlord and due to be heard in two weeks.
``We have been told by our solicitor not to worry about the money.
``If we wanted to extend the house in the future, it would have to be on ground
belonging to the estate,'' said Mrs Arlott.
Retired prison governor Douglas Houston and wife, May, have been told payments
will be met by their solicitor through insurance. Mr Hamilton has indicated he
is prepared to scrap the leases, at a price.

AN animal rights organisation said yesterday that the National Lottery was
partly to blame for a crisis that may force its closure next year.
Animal Concern's income from the public has halved - to just #30 a week - since
the lottery began and so marginal are its finances, a directors' meeting in
January will decide whether or not to sell its office, its sole asset.
Mr John Robins, the group's organising secretary and only full-time employee,
said the bulk of the group's #40,000 annual income comes from legacies and
donations.
Smaller amounts come in from subscriptions, appeals, and local fund-raising
events.
Mr Robins said: ``Since the lottery started, donations have gone right down but
we are not allowed to be a charity, as we are opposed to vivisection - and this
means we cannot apply for lottery grants.''
The organisation began life in 1876 as the Scottish Anti-Vivisection Society,
changed its name in 1988 to Animal Concern Scotland, and dropped the Scotland
tag two years later.
Working from an office in a converted hairdresser's shop in Glasgow, it has
about 350 members and campaigns on issues including seal culling,
puppy-farming, and ostrich-farming.
Mr Robins said it can survive on legacies only by spending the money as it
comes in, unlike larger organisations, which invest it and use the interest.
``Last year, we had #40,000 from legacies and #50,000 in expenses, and no group
can really function like that. You can go five or six years without a big
legacy,'' he said.
If the directors decide to sell the office, Mr Robins thinks Animal Concern
could function if he worked from home, but only for a few months.
``We are probably one of the best-known groups in Scotland, if not Britain, but
the lottery hasn't helped. It has pulled income right down, and left us in a
Catch 22 position, unable to apply for funds.''
Meanwhile, the National Lottery Charities Board in Scotland is to go on the
road this winter to help voluntary organisations prepare for the second round
of awards, which will be based on the twin themes of ``youth issues'' and ``low
income''.
The first cash handouts from lottery funds were announced last month. More than
220 Scottish charities and community groups shared a #17,600,000 pay-out for
anti-poverty groups.
There were 977 unsuccessful grant applications and Scotland received nearly
half of all the cash distributed in Britain by lottery chiefs.
The new round of awards is due to be announced in spring and the board has
drawn up plans for a series of seminars for charity and community groups
throughout the country. It is also planning ``surgery sessions'', where
applicants can talk to the board's grant assesors about their bids.
Application forms will be available from November 27, with the closing date for
bids February 16.

CONGRATULATIONS, Currie. They clinched the second-division Championship with an
eight-try trouncing of Stewart's Melville at Inverleith yesterday, and did it
in the style we have come to appreciate.
Currie's handling skills looked more Samoan than Scottish, their support play
was excellent, and skipper Ally Donaldson marshalled his forces with crisp
confidence.
Among those who should be toasted is the person who sent the two New
Zealanders. Big Chad Eagle soared like one and Dean Sheppard was an inventive,
if occasionally over-elaborating, full back.
The pair go home in the new year and it is not clear what the contractual
situation will be next season. I remain convinced that the Scottish game
benefits from their presence.
For every success story there is another of a team in trouble and it is sad to
see a club of the stature of Stewart's Melville in dire straits. They are set
to dive into the third division unless reconstruction saves them.
Currie began uncertainly. A try by winger Geoff Keen after quarter-of-an-hour
put them ahead. Home full back Grant Pollock missed two penalty chance before
his side were hit by a double-whammy just before the break. First Steve Logan
wriggled over for Donaldson to convert, then Sheppard, side-stepping sweetly,
added another try.
Currie entertained in the second half. Dougie Rogerson pinched a home heel for
his try, Scott Forrester sprinted 70 metres for the touchdown, and Dave Wilson
finished off a sweeping move.
At last Stewart's Melville rallied. Malcolm Rennie grabbed their first try and
Nick Penny the other. Michael Plumb went over at the other end and Forrester
brought down the curtain with a dash to the corner.
Stewart's Melville FP - G Pollock; A Huett, N Gallacher, F Pollock, M Tweedie;
D Wyllie, M Rennie; R McNulty, A Cadzow, J Conlin, M Paton, W Faulds, B Foster,

AN ANECDOTE. We had just finished recording a programme about the success or
otherwise of Operation Eagle, Strathclyde Police's high-profile anti-drugs
campaign. Two men came up to me, both on the senior side of middle age.
They were from a community council, they said. And they had been riveted by
what some of the contributers had been saying for the past hour. They had no
idea about any of that going on.
They are not alone. What characterises drug use and abuse in Britain today is
not an information gap among regular users - many of whom have a comprehensive
and sophisticated knowledge about a whole range of illegal substances - but a
generation gap. For those whose teenage rebellion comprised getting drunk
enough to be comprehensively sick while underage, the rave culture and drugs
like ecstasy are foreign fields.
They could learn much from their offspring. Also in the audience that night
were some very young teenagers who had been recruited into a group who use
drama as a means of communicating about drug-taking risks to their peers.
Matter of factly they agree that they know very much more about who took what
and why than their mums did. They were uniformly dismissive of simplistic
campaigns of the ``Just Say No'' variety.
What these streetwise kids did was tell it like they know it to be: ``Hey,
guys, we know you're using, and if you're going to keep doing it for a while,
here's the safest way to do it, and this is the bottom line on your chances of
doing your self serious harm''.
Also present were all too many representatives of groups where that message had
not been refined and disseminated in time. People who had wound up in crisis
centres or hospitals or both. People whose friends and relations had wound up
in the morgue. Yet they too were aware that the pressures which took them over
the line from recreational use to dependency were not those which would have
been resisted by knee-jerk responses or scare stories.
Ironically the health educators, particularly in Scotland, have long understood
this.
I would not imagine that the Health Education Board in Scotland, for instance,
would be in the market for utilising that tragic picture of Leah Betts taken
just before she lost her fight for adult life. The HEB knows that campaigns of
the ``Heroin Screws You Up'' variety do very little more than advise an age
group determined on whatever risks it can get its hands on that here is a
really scary thing to try.
In fact one of their latest publications, aimed at parents, is an honest guide
as to which drugs do what. That kind of frankness is important because logic,
and all those young recruits to the harm-reduction campaign, tell you that
nobody takes drugs to make themselves feel bad.
Why should the motivation of an E.user be any different from someone determined
on half a dozen pints and chasers? Especially since E, lethal as it can be for
some people in some circumstances, does not apparently involve a hangover,
unless you count delayed fatigue from dancing all night.
So if you are pushing literature or messages which essentially say that drugs
only have down sides then your credibility is zilch.
This is not a thought which appeals to most politicians, or indeed some senior
policemen, who are instinctively more at ease with apocalyptic pronouncements
and much talk of punitive measures for users as well as pushers. It is curious
how some people can spend so much time in and around the drug culture and learn
so little about what makes it tick.
That naivety is pretty widespread. Some of the voluntary effort put into
combating drug dependency pursues a rigorous policy of people agreeing to
coming off drugs completely and forever or don't darken their doorstep. A sort
of illegal drugs variant on the Alcoholics Anonymous message. But just as AA
has problems with understanding that abstinence will never be the answer for
some people who only want to be able to use alcohol sensibly, so the hard-line
drugs reformers can't accept that for certain clients the goal is not never,
but not too often and not too much.
All of which leads to some positively cockeyed miscarriages of natural justice.
A person who deals in drugs by way of making a handsome living, and whose
business depends on introducing young people to hard drugs or expensive habits,
deserves to have the law show him the same leniency he has shown his young
victims.
Someone growing cannabis in their greenhouse to ensure a cheap, quality supply
for private and personal use can only be confused with Mr Big in a society
which is profoundly ill-educated about drugs. I would guess a fairly large
percentage of the baby-boomer generation had a fling with cannabis. Some still
use it, others ``graduated'' to alcohol. You will not, however, find very many
middle-aged people dependent on heroin as a result of that youthful
experimentation.
Neither, I suspect, will we find many middle-aged people 25 years hence whose
use of ecstasy led them into addiction. In fact I would very much doubt if E
itself will buck the fashion trends and still be around.
What classically happens is that most people who use drugs, even those who
become highly dependent, get through what is essentially that phase when other
things happen in their lives which take priority. Jobs, partners, children,
other interests.
Where we have got a problem is in having a society which denies or at least
postpones these rites of passage for increasing numbers of young people.
You are not likely to graduate to a stable family unit if you have no regular
income and no particular prospect of one.
I would guess that the biggest dent in the numbers of people who lose their
lives to drugs will come not through campaigns, necessary as those are, but
through the provision of more employment and training schemes of the
non-Mickey-Mouse variety.
Sadly, for those politicians addicted to applause, that has two obvious
disadvantages. It is not a quick fix producing instant plaudits, and you can't
make it into a slick slogan.

THREE tries in a four-minute spell finally KO'd a gallant and talented Dundee
side whose play was totally belied by the final tally.
After having been 17 points behind from the sixteenth minute, the visitors to
Old Anniesland played some enterprising rugby and were denied worthwhile reward
because of some amazing cover tackling from GHK. Dundee now go into their last
match on Saturday needing to win to survive in the second division.
GHK swept into a 17-point lead mainly through the electric speed and thought of
George Breckenridge. He put over a penalty in eight minutes then zipped into
the line for a try after good work by Andy Ness, Harry Bassi, Cammy Little, and
John McLeod. Breckenridge converted his own touchdown then brought out full
points after Bassi had charged down an Arran Whitney clearance.
Dundee took over after this, but all they had to show for ample possession were
two penalties by fly-half Chris Robinson before half-time.
GHK suddenly were struggling for possession as Stewart Campbell (he decided to
play despite his brief encounters with Western Samoa at Murrayfield on
Saturday), Gregor Hayter, Derek Milne, and Tony McWhirter started winning more
ball. But GHK held firm and conceded only another penalty to Robinson.
Breckenridge replied with a similar kick in 49 minutes. Whitney kicked a huge
penalty for Dundee to make it 20-12 but then came the sucker punches that put
Dundee on the floor.
In 64 minutes Breckenridge intruded again and put powerhouse winger Graham
Agnew in for a try. A minute later, the ball was whipped out to the flying
Agnew and he was over again. Breckenridge was on target again to goal a cheeky
try by Cammy Little in 68 minutes.
GHK - G Breckenridge; G Agnew, T Sanderson, H Bassi, G Hawkes; J McLeod, C
Little; S Gay, C Docherty, G McIlwham, C du Plessis, K Wilson, S Unkles, M
Wallace, A Ness. Replacements - R Sweeney for Ness (43 mins), C Dunlop for
Breckenridge (74 mins).
Dundee HS FP - A Whitney; D Mason, S Longstaff, D Hamilton, J Price; C
Robinson, A Featherstone; S Lithgow, G Scott, N Robertson, S Campbell, G
Hayter, C Samson, T McWhirter, D Milne.
Referee - J Steele (Dumfries).
SCORERS: GHK - Breckenridge, 1t, 2p, 3c; Agnew, 2t; Bassi, 1t; Little, 1t.
Dundee - Robinson, 3p; Whitney, 1p.

BUSINESSMAN Ian Nicol fulfilled a dream yesterday as he spent #27,500 to buy
car number plate N1 COL.
Mr Nicol, who runs a Shotts boilermaking firm, reckoned it was a bargain at the
price and was prepared to offer up to #50,000 to make sure his bid at the
auction of specialised car registration numbers at the SECC in Glasgow was a
winner.
Mr Nicol was delighted with his plate and said: ``I realised about five years
ago that this plate would come up when the N registrations came into being and
that this number would make our name.
``When the N registrations came in earlier this year, I was determined it was
going to be mine. I was prepared to go higher to get it and would have gone as
far as #50,000. I got it for a lot less, a real snip.''
Nicol Boilers' fleet of vehicles all have NBS registration plates.
However, a few minutes later, his bid paled into insignificance when Mr Niall
Walker bid #40,000 for his christian name N1 ALL and would have bid another
#5000 to make sure he was successful.
By the time VAT and other expenses were included, the price of Mr Walker's
registration was exactly #50,805.
Now it will be fitted to his three-year-old Vauxhall Calibra which is valued at
about one third of the price of his new number plate. He later splashed out
another #4500 for a special number for his wife Katrina's car when he captured
M1 OWN - My Own.
Mr Walker, of East Kilbride - who runs his own engineering business - was
delighted with his purchase but son Iain, 12, was ``astounded'' at the cost of
the number plate.
Iain had his eye on the Ferrari on display at the Scottish Motor Show with a
price tag of #190,000-plus.
The numbers were among 480 specialised plates that went under the hammer,
including BEV 1E which fetched a modest #3100.
Former Scottish rugby captain Gavin Hastings showed a passing interest in 15
GAV which sold for #1800 but was not interested in bidding. He said: ``I was
put off by the price.''
The day-long sale, organised by the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency,
raised more than #2m for the Exchequer.

MORE young people are taking drugs and they are experimenting at an earlier
age, according to a survey released today.
Ecstasy and cannabis use is not seen by youngsters as a problem.
Indeed, it is so commonplace as to be considered the norm by many young people,
said the drug abuse charity, Turning Point, which compiled the report.
A worrying number of young people are turning to cocktails of illegal drugs -
including ecstasy, heroin, and crack cocaine - in their search for kicks, said
Turning Point's chief executive, Ms Wendy Thomson.
The survey is the first nationwide study of drug agency clients and comes in
the wake of the death last week of Leah Betts, 18, who went into a coma after
taking a single ecstasy pill.
Ten per cent of people who went to Turning Point for help with drug problems in
1994-95 were under the age of 18 but only a tiny number saw their ecstasy use
as anything to worry about.
Ms Thomson said the results of the research gave ``grave cause for concern''
and called for practical help for users.
She said: ``What comes across is that young people do not see the use of
recreational dance drugs and cannabis as a problem. Indeed, in their view, it
is entirely acceptable.
``More effective practical services need to be set up to reach them, including
help where it counts - whether it be at raves and clubs for recreational users
or counselling and treatment for serious drug problems - to stop people risking
their lives unnecessarily.''
Researcher Daniel Ratchford produced the report by studying the experiences of
27,000 people who approached Turning Point for help with drug and alcohol
problems last year - almost double the 14,000 who were helped in 1993-94.
He said: ``The main trends in young people's drug use can be summed up as
`more, earlier'. More young people are using drugs and at an earlier age.
``The main drug used by young people is cannabis. Cannabis use among young
people is now seen by many of them as the norm.
``Large numbers of young people are also using LSD and ecstasy - the so-called
dance drugs - but this use is mainly recreational. Most young people do not
perceive that they have a problem using these drugs.''
Nearly two-thirds of the people coming to Turning Point with drug problems are
aged under 30, around half are under 24, and 10% are under 18.
Nearly a fifth of younger users said they regularly took two or more types of
drug.
Mr Ratchford added: ``A worryingly large number of young people - 15.8% - had
problems relating to ampheta-mines, the majority being intravenous users.''
Turning Point is the UK's largest charity helping people with drink and drug
problems, with more than 60 projects in England and Scotland.

England 14, South Africa 24
WILL Carling, England's captain, was carried off with a neck injury and
concussion during match against world champions South Africa at Twickenham,
but, despite a forced absence over the next three weeks, he is confident of
being fit to play against Western Samoa on December 16.
England were always second best on Saturday to a side who can now claim 14
successive victories.
Scottish referee Jim Fleming contrived to make their task slightly more
difficult by disallowing what appeared a good try by winger Chester Williams
after 27 minutes.
But Williams extracted full revenge by going over after 38 and 64 minutes, and
in between came a magnificent touchdown by scrum half Joost van der Westhuizen
only 49 seconds after the beak.
Joel Stransky shared four early penalties with Jon Callard then missed with
five successive attempts, including three missed conversions.
Stransky did manage one more penalty in response to another Callard penalty,
but England had lost their way and full back Andre Joubert helped put the issue
beyond doubt with a delightful kick along the ground which Williams snapped up
before scrambling over at the left-hand corner.
The Springboks then displayed their defensive qualities as England fought for
scoreline respectability.
Ironically, it was Phil De Glanville, replacement for Carling, who claimed the
consolation try with the match already in injury time.

Ireland 44, Fiji 8
IRELAND coasted to an easy victory over Fiji at Lansdowne Road on Saturday, the
Fijians having no answer to the power of the Irish pack and the strong running
of their backs.
Ireland went ahead after nine minutes when Paddy Johns crashed over for a try,
converted by fly-half Paul Burke. Neil Francis scored the second, also
converted by Burke, who traded penalties with Jonetani Waqa to complete the
first half scoring.
After the break, Burke scored a second penalty, then converted a try by Jim
Staples. Richard Wallace and Simon Geoghegan then got in on the try-scoring
act, followed by prop Paul Wallace, who burst over following a tapped penalty.
This time Burke added the conversion, having failed with the previous
conversion attempts, to close the scoring for Ireland.
Fiji got a consolation try in injury-time through No.8 Fereimi Tawake.

A fire which killed four people, left another two in hospital, and gutted flats
above a 24-hour grocery early yesterday may have been started deliberately,
according to police.
Firefighters found the bodies of a man and two women in the front room of a
third-floor flat above the grocery on busy Shepherd's Bush Green, west London.
Town hall blaze
CENTRAL streets of Wem, Shropshire, were closed off last night as 60 firemen
attended a blaze at the town hall. Safety experts were brought in when it was
feared that parts of the three-storey building could collapse. There were no
reports of injuries.
Lifebelt found
A LIFEBELT found off the coast of County Donegal was confirmed last night to
be from the Irish trawler Carrickatine, missing with its crew of six since
Wednesday. The discovery was made close to Tory Island, where scores of fish
boxes also thought to be from the missing craft were located earlier yesterday.
Shopaholics
SHOPPING addiction is growing in an increasingly consumerist society, according
to a report published today. It said compulsive shopping behaviour affects
nearly twice as many women as men and gives them a ``high'' akin to taking
drugs.
Casino premiere
A PROCESSION of stars arriving for the premiere of Martin Scorsese's new film
Casino in London's West End last night was minus the movie's lead players
Robert De Niro and Sharon Stone. Scorsese says the film is an extension of his
earlier work Goodfellas and tells of the rise and fall of a casino business in
Las Vegas in the 1970s. Among those who turned up at the Empire Leicester
Square were Eric Clapton, Sir John and Lady Mills and their daughter Hayley.
Boxer in dispute
AMERICAN boxer Benjamin Marquez, who was to have fought Scot Gary Jacobs at
Glasgow Kelvin Hall on Saturday, was involved in a dispute over his hotel bill
yesterday. Strathclyde Police interviewed the boxer but no charges were laid.
Fire study
FIRE-RAISING is one of the most common causes of fire in industry, according to
a report released yesterday. It said more than one in 10 fires in offices or
factories was started deliberately.
Jobs created
THIRTY-ONE train catering jobs have been created by InterCity East Coast. The
new employees will serve more than a million cups of free tea and coffee every
year to passengers travelling first-class.
Old Firm arrests
NINETEEN supporters were arrested for minor offences at yesterday's Old Firm
match at Ibrox, Strathclyde Police said last night.
Victim named
A YOUNG man who died after a road accident on Carnegie Road, near Bathgate,
West Lothian, on Saturday night was named yesterday as Mr Bryan Kane, 19, of
Kirk Road, Bathgate.
Miscarriage
BABIES lost through miscarriage will be remembered today as flowers are laid at
five places throughout Central Scotland. The flowers were dedicated in an

France 12, New Zealand 37
NEW Zealand exacted ample revenge for last week's defeat by France, winning the
second Test by a crushing margin in Paris on Saturday, with tries by Eric Rush,
Glen Osborne, Ian Jones, and Jonah Lomu, and five penalties from Simon Culhane.
France failed to build on a try by captain Philippe Saint-Andre after only five
minutes and although he went over for a second try eight minutes from the end,
the match had by then been well and truly lost.
Rush scored in the sixteenth minute and Culhane added five penalties as the All
Blacks pressed to give his side a 20-5 lead at the break.
The match was over less than six minutes after the interval when full back
Osborne completed a superb New Zealand move, Jones scoring the next after 58
minutes.
Lomu finally shook off the obsessive attention of the French cover to score New
Zealand's fourth between the posts 10 minutes from the end.
Saint-Andre's second try two minutes later set off a late French rally but
there was no way back by then.

NOT just another Saturday in Casualty at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary. More like a
clearing station on the Western Front.
In the wake of the first Old Firm match of the season the walking wounded are
arriving in numbers. As the rows of seats in the waiting area fill up most of
the incumbents are carrying their own personalised Red Cards. There is much
seepage of blood.
Some of the clientele ruminate stoically on the circumstances that brought them
here. Some are too befuddled to care. Others, fuelled with drink, suffer
belligerently. At the back of the room few notice the petite brunette in a
faded denim shirt and black cowboy boots. But she does not miss much. Morag
Fullerton is doing her homework.
``It was excellent. I was there for two hours and there were two serious
stabbings, a suicide and countless minor injuries. The doctors and nurses were
continually being hassled by drunks,'' she recalls.
``The staff do an incredible job and I was grateful to be given permission to
observe them at work. It was my first experience of what goes on in a busy
casualty department. It was shocking but I'm sure it helped me a great deal
when it came to capturing the reality of it on film.''
It is now two months since her night at the business end of a big city
hospital. She has just wrapped the third of her three episodes of the new
series of BBC Scotland's hit TV series Cardiac Arrest.
In the past there was more likelihood of encountering an extra-terrestrial in
Scotland than a native-born female film director. At last count Fullerton was
still the only woman directing network television projects in the country. But
if current trends continue she won't be the only significant female in the
male-dominated profession, for long.
Since man first cranked a camera and made moving pictures, many names have been
stencilled on the legendary canvas-backed director's chair. Collectively they
had one thing in common. With few exceptions, they spelt-out a message of
exclusivity which read ``Men Only''.
But times have changed in the film and television industry. Femmes Helmers
Brighten Brit Biz. Thus spake a recent headline in the US showbiz bible
Variety. The accompanying feature highlighted a significant sea change in UK
movie making, which has seen a new wave of female directors taking the helm in
what was once an all-male preserve and ``breathing new life into British film''.
Only a small clutch of British women directors - Sally Potter (Orlando),
Antonia Bird (Priest), Beeban Kidron (her Hollywood drag-queen opus To Wong Foo
Thanks For Everything Julie Newmar is in a cinema near you this week) - have
made a significant impact in recent years. But with British Screen, a major
source of funding for UK movies, estimating that half of it's current projects
now have women directors, this looks certain to change.
Emotionally charged films are what the public wants to see and, in the opinion
of those who ``greenlight'' projects, women directors are more willing to let
go emotionally. ``There's an emotional range that women can bring to films that
men, especially British men, find difficult, because they are so repressed,''
says BBC film boss Mark Shivas.
Some of the new wave of women film-makers arrive in the director's chair
straight from film school, others have long experience in the theatre.
Fullerton paid her dues in the latter category.
Born in Castle Douglas and educated at Kirkudbright Academy, she studied drama
at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. After a spell in London
sidestepping the casting couch as a wannabe actress, she returned to Scotland
as artistic director at Borderline Theatre Company in Ayr, where she directed
Gregor Fisher, Phyllis Logan and Iain Glen early-on in their careers. Her
biggest break came when she was selected as one of four from 200 applicants for
a coveted place on the BBC Drama Directors Course.
As she puffs on a fag she doesn't seem much of a match for the Marlboro Man.
She is small, she's attractive, she's feminine but there is nothing tentative
about her demeanour on a film set. How did she learn to exert authority in a
high pressure profession where males have tended to dominate.
``I'm no martyr,'' she smiles wryly. ``But sometimes you feel that you had to
be twice as good as a man to command any attention. I don't have a bee in my
bonnet about it but sexism is something I've encountered off and on over the
years.
``Early-on I was directing a play set in a factory with a cast of eight men. A
couple of them were older than my father and because the play centred on `mens'
work' the basic attitude was, `What can a wee lassie possibly know about this?'
They thought I was a pushover. There were some awkward moments. But I'd done my
homework and when they realised I knew what I was talking about, it worked out
OK.
``I've run into some difficult people, the ego has landed et cetera. But most
actors are great. Insecure, paranoid, daft . . . but wonderful people. One of
my strengths is that I do understand what the craft is about. Unlike some with
a more technical background, I'm never likely to direct an actor to, `Step to
the right and show anger'.''
How does it feel to arrive on a set for the first time when the money involved
runs into telephone numbers? ``Your stomach is churning,'' she admits.
``Everyone is waiting to be told what to do and a lot depends on the impression
you make on the first day. I've always been easy going but I'm very disciplined
about my work. I could afford a bit more of that gnawing drive but it's not in
my nature. I want to enjoy the trip. We're not saving lives after all. It's
entertainment.
``You work under pressure at great speed. (Fullerton was on-set for 12 hours a
day for three weeks to complete her three episodes of Cardiac Arrest.) But
that's all right as long as you are able to adapt and have a good strong idea
of what you want to shoot each day.''
Before the move to film and television Fullerton worked with Robbie Coltrane,
who is now a close personal friend. The little-and-large pairing wrote a Comic
Strip script called Jealousy together. Coltrane starred and Fullerton directed.
Later they got together for the stage production of Mr Buffo, which was filmed
for television.
Jean Stewart is another director who found working with Scotland's leading
actor/comedian rewarding. She directed the controversial ``rape'' episode in
the last series of Cracker and since then she has been inundated with scripts,
several from Hollywood.
``Getting a woman to direct that particular episode of Cracker was quite
cynical in a way, since no-one could then level any criticism on the grounds of
sexism,'' she explains. ``But it was also the right decision to approach the
subject from a woman's point of view with a woman's sensibility.
``Now any script with a rape in it seems to land on my doorstep but so far none
of them has particularly interested me.''
What did interest Stewart was ``a wonderful piece of writing'' by Howard
Schuman (presenter of Moving Pictures and writer of Rock Follies). It was the
script for a BBC Scotland feature film, Nervous Energy. It's a tragic but
life-affirming love story about an expariate Glaswegian's return to his home
city. Stewart shot it in Govan, Bearsden and the West End during the summer
heatwave.
Stewart was born in South Africa but both parents hailing from Dumfries.
Initially a lecturer in English at Leeds University she changed course and,
after making a couple of short films, she won a place at the National Film
School. Her first breakthrough came directing EastEnders.
``I was terrified on the first day. Everything is director-led. There were
between 60 and 70 people looking at me. There was no-one to lean on. I just had
to grit my teeth and get on with it. EastEnders turned out to have a very good
working environment.''
Stewart went on to direct episodes of The Bill, Police and Hospital and
occasionally the working environment was not quite so congenial. ``It isn't
very encouraging when the first question is, `Are you the lady director?' Some
of the technicians found it very difficult to accept a woman in charge. They
could be very obstructive. Their preconception seemed to be that `women do the
sitting-down role' and they were very bad tempered.''
But women directors do seem to gravitate towards intense, emotional,
relationship dramas. English director Beeban Kidron says she would love to
direct an action movie and keeps looking for a script for Diehard - With A
Meaning, without finding one. Would Jean consider shifting gear into a
different genre? She would indeed. ``I'd love to do a resonant thriller or a
gritty comedy,'' she says.

AN iron fence at the edge of a reservoir was just another hiccup for the Camus
Productions team shooting their Gaelic Tartan Short film, An Lobiart (The
Sacrifice), on the outskirts of Edinburgh.
For first-time film producer Lucy Conan, it was just one of many obstacles to
be overcome. ``We've got this fence round this reservoir that we are using for
a loch and we thought we could probably cut off the bottom. We got a quote from
a blacksmith who said #700, we said on your bike, we'll do it for #250
ourselves, and we got a wonderful man down from Skye. In the end it will have
cost us hundreds of pounds and will cost us more to put back.''
Conan keeps an eye on the budget and has the full support of Ian MacDonald,
Camus Productions' accountant, who also happens to be her husband. This is just
an example of how everyone has to pitch in to make the production a reality.
With a budget of #45,000 a tight hand has to be kept on the purse strings. The
funding for the project comes from the Scottish Film Production Fund and the
BBC.
It's Conan's first attempt at producing a film but she has both TV and radio
experience. The other two people behind this film are Aonghas MacNeacail, the
writer, and Gerda Stevenson, the director. It was MacNeacail who decided to
embark on this project which was to be his first film script. It was script
writing for the Gaelic soap Machair which allowed MacNeacail to write in his
native tongue again. ``When I started writing poetry I wrote in English. It
didn't occur to me to write in Gaelic until I went to further education college
and came across twentieth-century Gaelic poetry.''
Prerequisites for the Gaelic Tartan short are that both original script and
producer be Gaelic. Conan's grasp of the Irish Gaelic language filled the
second requirement, leaving the production team with only the director's
position to fill. MacNeacail had to look no further than his wife, Gerda
Stevenson. ``I knew Gerda could do the job because of her sense of the
visual,'' he said.
Stevenson, a talented actress, is more accustomed to being at the other end of
the camera. She started an all-women theatre company, Stellar Quines, last year
as well as making an appearance alongside Mel Gibson on screen.
The film is set on an island, filmed for the most part in Lothian region,
although there are some shots in Skye, thanks to a cash injection from Skye and
Lochalsh Enterprise. The story is one of a meeting of past and present and has
overtones of ritual sacrifice. The main actors are Domhnall Ruadh and Ceit
Kearney, with Ian Cuthbertson appearing as a pathologist.
At the halfway stage of filming, the general feeling among cast and crew is
positive. MacNeacail, however, is experiencing mixed emotions. ``I'm
ecstatically terrified. It's a strange feeling of elation and `in the name of
God, what's happening here?' You hand it over to other people to do their bits
in interpreting it but it does still seem like a huge responsibility ..... this
is being interpreted by 30 or so people. Yes it's ecstatically terrifying,''
the writer said.
For Conan, wheeling and dealing on the telephone has become second nature.
``Every time you sit down the phone goes but it has to be like that.''
The question is ..... will she do this again after her first experience? ``For
the past week I've said never again but it's probably like childbirth!''
n.The Sacrifice will be shown at the Celtic Film Festival and screened on BBC
Television in 1996.

THE Tennents Premiership is bad medicine for those with dodgy heartbeats, as
most of the big crowd at Mansfield Park testified after an enthralling contest
and a sensational finish by which Hawick took the honours against Edinburgh
Academicals, who must be pondering why so much of their quality play did not
achieve the desired and highly essential result.
Academicals were deservedly ahead by 13-9 with just 15 minutes left. The
improving Scott Murray and the artful Malcolm McVie created a fruitful lineout
platform, Academicals frequently gained the nudge in close-quarter toil,
pillaged the better share of 50-50 ball, and had a splendid ally in Brian
Hay-Smith's left foot as well as some attractive transference among the backs.
Hawick owed much to their loose-forward blend, Brian Renwick playing the best
rugby of his career, Derek Turnbull abrasive and streetwise as ever until sadly
stretchered off with a broken right tibia, and Graham Allott, short in stature
but a veritable buzz bomb all over the pitch. Scott Welsh vied with Hay-Smith
in tacticianship and punt placement, the midfield defence was rock solid, and
Colin Turnbull is gaining in stature as full back. Yet it was only when Keith
Suddon was launched in the second half that Hawick really threatened scoring
incision.
Hay-Smith had slotted two penalty goals and the conversion of a thoroughly
merited try by Martin Waite following a lineout won by McVie, a probe by Chris
Simmers, and thundering support from the inimitable David McIvor, who was at
the heart of the drive that churned Waite over.
Welsh having landed two penalty goals and a drop goal, his third penalty goal
brought Hawick to within one point at 12-13. Chris Newton made a crucial save
from a Suddon chip ahead and Welsh was fractionally out with two drop goal
attempts as prelude to one of the tries of the season.
Ironically, it stemmed from a lineout where Hawick had been outgunned. Cameron
Murray prodded a delicate grubber for Gregor Sharp to latch on to, and Murray,
David Grant, and Renwick linked brilliantly for Murray to score and Welsh to
convert after a rippling move over 75 metres that brought the stand audience to
its feet.
McIvor led a spirited Academicals' final onslaught but when breakdown enabled
Colin Turnbull and Suddon to counterattack, Michael Robertson should have
scored.
Hawick - C W Turnbull; G W J Sharp, C A Murray, D S Grant, K L Suddon; W S
Welsh, K W Reid; M Russell, G Blacklock, B J McDonnell, A Barnes, I Elliot, D J

THE lead singer with folk rock band Lindisfarne died of a suspected heart
attack at the weekend, after collapsing at his home.
Alan Hull, 50, who wrote Geordie anthem Fog on the Tyne, became ill on Friday
night at his home in North Shields, Tyne and Wear.
He was taken to North Tyneside General Hospital but died soon after. His wife
Pat and daughters Rosamund, Bernice, and Francesca were with him.
The former psychiatric nurse had a string of hits with the group in the early
1970s.
Yesterday, Ray Laidlaw, Lindisfarne's drummer, paid tribute to his friend: ``He
was like a brother to me. We had worked together so long it's difficult to
think about the band without him.
``He was such a great songwriter. He'll be most famous for Fog on the Tyne but
his other songs had so much meaning to them. His lyrics were wonderful,'' he
said.

YOUNG Hustler was on offer at 20-1 for the Grand National after a fine
performance over the Aintree fences on Saturday, writes Tom McConnell.
Unlucky in two at-tempts at the National, he must be good value on the evidence
of his bloodless victory in the Becher Chase.
Giving his nine rivals two stones, Young Hustler led from the second and was
never headed.
``We've had terrible luck with him because he's never made a mistake in his
life,'' said trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies. ``He is so brave and so genuine.''
If all goes well Young Hustler will return to Liverpool on March 30, but by
then the 20-1 will have long gone.

Jed-Forest 19, Selkirk 3
CHAMPAGNE flowed in the dressing room after the game at Riverside Park
yesterday when Jed-Forest booked their place in the first division next season.
Jed scored two tries to nil and deserved to take the points, but coach Donald
Miller warned that the hard work was just beginning for the difficult season
upstairs next year.
Club president Lawrence Armstrong said it was no use going up unless Jed
intended to stay there. Both are hoping that international scrum half Gary
Armstrong will stay at Jed but after the match he said he was still to make up
his mind on a possible move to Newcastle.
Miller feels that he will lose his talented scrum half, but is still hoping
that Armstrong will stay. It was he who wrapped up the points for Jed with a
try six minutes from time after the home forwards had won good ball on the
Selkirk line. The visitors battled hard in a dour contest, but in the end the
Jed back-row of Kevin Armstrong, Calum Brown, and captain Ronnie Kirkpatrick
carried too much power and experience for the Selkirk pack.
Brown scored the only try of the first half, taking good ball in a scrummage
five metres out and driving through to touch down in 35 minutes. Chris Richards
had given Jed the lead with a penalty in 17 minutes, cancelled out by David
Hunter for Selkirk in 28, but just on half-time visiting captain Keith
McConnell questioned a decision and was penalised. From the penalty, Richards
kicked Jed ahead.
Jed stepped up a gear in the second half, with Richards adding a penalty in 52
minutes before Armstrong put the icing on the celebration cake for the
Riverside men. Selkirk were not able to create many chances and now must beat
GHK next Saturday to have a chance of avoiding relegation.
Jed-Forest - C Richards; K Amos, A Douglas, D Hemming, M Yule; G Scott, G
Armstrong; N McIlroy, K Barrie, G Kerr, A Dunnet, C Hynd, K Armstrong, C Brown,
R Kirkpatrick. Replacement: B Law for Dunnet (30min).
Selkirk - D Hunter; M Jaffray, K Johnston, D Gage, D Hulme; S Nichol, A
Lindores; B Johnston, D Graham, S McColm, D Cameron, K McConnell, S Hamilton, W
Gentleman, P Minto. Replacement: S McKenzie for Gentleman (66).

q.Leaders Cardiff retained their five-point margin over Pontypridd at the
Heineken League summit, but not before Newbridge gave them a scare, eventually
going down 30-18 on Saturday.
Pontypridd leapfrogged over Llanelli into second place with a 31-18 win over
the Stradey Park side, outscoring them by three tries to two.
Neath's former Welsh captain Gareth Llewellyn celebrated his 200th game for the
club with a try in the third minute in the 18-11 win over Swansea.
Abertillery beat Aberavon 28-11 to move off the bottom of the table while
Treorchy took Abertillery's place at the bottom, losing 33-17 at Bridgend after
trailing by just one point, at half-time.
Newport almost threw away a 22-3 lead over Ebbw Vale in a six-try thriller but
held on to win 25-22 with a final penalty from outside half Gareth Rees.

THE Scottish nannie looking after the children of a Cambodian prince who is
under house arrest on murder plot charges was said last night to be safe and in
touch with the Foreign Office.
The twin brother of Miss Janet McDonnell, Mr Michael McDonnell from Kilmarnock,
said: ``My only concern is for my sister's welfare. Whatever repercussions
there are for the prince, I hope they do not fall on his children and my
sister.''
The royalist Cambodian member of parliament, Prince Norodom Sirivudh, was
placed under house arrest on Saturday by the Cambodian Government for alleged
involvement in an assassination plot against co-premier Hun Sen, according to
Cambodian Government officials.
Miss McDonnell, 35, has been the nannie of his infant son and two daughters for
the past year. She previously held the post of matron at Edinburgh Academy. She
was hired by the prince last year after joining a London agency.
She phoned her twin on Saturday and her younger brother Brian's home yesterday.
``She said she was not worried and that we were not to worry. The prince is
under house arrest. Automatically that means that everyone else in the house is
not allowed out - technically she is not under house arrest.
``She was not too worried. She said things have happened in the past when mail
was intercepted and phone calls cut off. The fact that she was able to phone is
a good sign,'' said Mr McDonnell.
The short road leading past the prince's pink villa in Phnom Penh was reported
at the weekend to be closed off to vehicles and civilians, with dozens of
soldiers and police on guard. A Reuter TV crew was forced to stop filming from
a nearby roof.
Co-premier Hun Sen said last Tuesday that extremists planned to kill him in the
royal palace grounds next year or by attacking his vehicle. He said he had
asked the interior ministry to investigate.
His remarks followed a report on November 11 in the New Angkor newspaper that
cited Prince Sirivudh as saying that hitmen aimed to kill the premier on the
road to his house or on a trip to a development project near the capital.
The prince has denied talking to the newspaper.
He said: ``I am a Khmer citizen. I haven't done anything wrong. I'm not killing
anybody so why should I leave?''
Prince Sirivudh said he would wait for his French wife to return from an
overseas trip. He would then discuss the matter with the king and ask for his
advice.
Prince Sirivudh is secretary-general of the Funcinpec Party and is a
half-brother of King Norodom Sihanouk.
A senior information ministry official said Prince Sirivudh's fate was being
discussed by King Sihanouk and his son, first prime minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.

Ammunition for legend of a crazy cowboy general
A GENIUS FOR WAR. A LIFE OF GENERAL GEORGE S PATTON
Carlo d'Este
HarperCollins, #25
No goddam sonofabitch ever won a war dying for his country; he won it by
getting the other poor dumb bastard to die for his.
THE famous words from Patton's pre-battle pep talk to his troops connote the
Patton of myth: the foul-mouthed, hard-driving fire-eater, the showman with the
ivory-handled revolvers strapped to his waist. Hitler, for whom Patton was the
most feared general on the Western front, rightly characterised him as ``that
crazy cowboy general''; Patton repaid the compliment by referring to the Fuhrer
as ``that paper-hanging sonofabitch''. But how far will a careful, scholarly
study buttress the Patton legend? This is the question Carlo d'Este sets out to
answer in a meticulously researched volume.
Despite several disparaging references to the ``Patton myth'', d'Este's careful
work succeeds for the most part in reinforcing the stereotype. In many ways
Patton emerges as even more of a monster, more of a creature of black comedy
than we had imagined possible. Take his celebrated ``short fuse''. According to
the evidence scrupulously laid out by d'Este, Patton's dreaded rages were the
sign of a man at least halfway to madness. At one military review Patton lost
his temper with the band and bawled out over the loudspeaker, ``Quit playing
that goddam music!'' apparently unaware that they were playing the US national
anthem.
As for the notorious slapping incidents in Sicily, when Patton on two separate
occasions in military hospitals set about soldiers suffering from shell shock,
the sober facts are even more alarming than in the legend. Like many figures on
the extreme right, Patton did not believe in the reality of mental illness and
simply regarded the men as ``goddam cowards''.
What d'Este establishes is that Patton had a long history of violence towards
his own troops. On the Western front in 1918 he killed a GI by hitting him on
the head with a shovel when the soldier seemed reluctant to dig ditches. During
the TORCH landings in North Africa in November 1942 he kicked one shell-shocked
soldier and struck another. And he often hanged soldiers for rape or shot them
out of hand for cowardice (despite the official myth that Private Eddie Slovik
was the only GI executed in the Second World War).
Patton got away with all this because for most of the time (until even their
patience snapped) he had the unfailing support of Eisenhower as Supreme
Commander, Europe, General Marshall, the head of the Army in Washington, and
Secretary of War Stimson.
Towards civilians or the enemy Patton was even more ruthless and homicidal. He
compulsively broke all speed limits and often covered 150 miles in two hours in
his Jeep in pre-motorway days. On a narrow bridge in Sicily his Jeep
encountered a peasant trying to manoeuvre two recalcitrant mules over the
stream. Patton simply took out his pistol, shot the animals dead and then had
them thrown off the bridge.
In his pep talks Patton encouraged his men to take no prisoners; on the first
few days in Sicily two GIs took him at his word and massacred 79 Italian PoWs.
In an attempt to rescue his son-in-law from a German Stalag in 1945 Patton
wantonly and without authorisation sent nearly 400 men on a suicide mission
from which only a handful emerged. In fairness to the man it must be
acknowledged that he himself was death-driven; d'Este lists 15 hair-breadth
brushes with death before the freak car crash in which Patton perished in
Germany in 1945.
All human beings are contradictions but Patton gave new meaning to the term
``divided self''. A virulent opponent of Hitler and the Nazis, Patton in his
final year (1945) spent most of his time in crazed diatribes against Jews and
communists that were indistinguishable from similar utterances by Goebbels and
Himmler. Even d'Este, who tries to give him the benefit of the doubt on most
occasions, virtually throws in the towel at this stage and admits that he was
well-nigh certifiable.
A foul-mouthed Boston aristocrat whose verbal profanities contrasted with his
prudishness about actual sex, Patton mixed psychopathic interludes with moments
of sentimentality and some genuine poetic insights (some of the verse he wrote
is not bad). He also had a sense of humour, and I must confess that, though
generally repelled by this monster of arrogance, conceit, and self-aggrandising
showmanship, I found myself laughing at some of his quips. There is this on the
advent of new weapons technology: ``When Samson took the fresh jawbone of an
ass and slew a thousand men therewith he probably started such a vogue for the
weapon that for years no prudent donkey dared to bray.''
One's fascination with Patton's larger-than-life personality tends to obscure
his qualities as a soldier. How good was he? He performed well in Sicily,
Normandy, and the Battle of the Bulge, but the title of d'Este's book is
misleading. By no stretch of the imagination was Patton a military genius in
the sense that Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Subudei, Tamerlane, and Napoleon
were. A better analogy would be with ruthless technicians of rapid and total
war like Sheridan and Sherman in the US Civil War. In his liking for the war of
movement and the lightning strike Patton recalls Murat, Napoleon's great
cavalry commander. The British military supremo, Viscount Alanbrooke, summed
him up well: ``A dashing, courageous, wild and unbalanced leader, good for
operations requiring thrust and push but at a loss in any operation requiring
skill and judgment.''
In a book of this length it is surprising how few blemishes there are. A
confused sentence on p.449 apparently has Churchill and Roosevelt winning the
battle of Stalingrad; we are told that Attila the Hun captured in Metz in AD.45
instead of 451; and d'Este refers to the ``little-known Franco-German war of
1866-67''. No wonder it is little known: there was no such war. Presumably the
author is thinking of the Austro-Prussian war of 1866. But such lapses are the
only true ``errors'' in the book.
Some will find the treatment of political, as opposed to military, matters on
the naive side. Certainly d'Este seems seriously to underrate FDR, Eisenhower,
and Omar Bradley, while rather absurdly overrating Montgomery. Surely it is
pretty well accepted by now that ``Monty'' was a showman and self-publicist on
a monumental level (the British Patton, in fact) whose legend far outran his
actual battlefield achievements.
But these are matters of interpretation on which experts can (and do) disagree.
This magisterial volume cannot be mistaken for anything other than a splendid
tribute to scholarship, commitment, and intellectual stamina.

<HEADLINE>Pay-off to NHS managers over trusts denied</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975290542</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
HEALTH board general managers in Scotland have been rewarded with substantial
salary increases as a ``pay-off'' for encouraging trust status, GP
fund-holding, and the privatisation of NHS services, the Labour MP for
Cunninghame South, Mr Brian Donohoe, claimed yesterday.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office denied the charge, saying the pay rises
were based on improving patient services.
Mr Donohoe's claims followed his release of a survey of pay and conditions of
the general managers of Scotland's 15 health boards.
He said the survey showed the salaries of some had ``increased by more than 20%
in a three-year period during which NHS workers had been pegged to annual
increases of 3%''.
He added that the information was supplied by the general managers' group and
Lothian Health Board.
He claimed that correspondence from the board showed that the general manager
of Lothian Health Board was the highest paid in Scotland in 1994/95, with a
gross salary of #85,100 when National Insurance contributions, superannuation,
and other ``on-costs'' of #9867 were accrued.
But a spokesman for Lothian Health Board said that the annual report put the
general manager's salary at #82,739, with ``on-costs'' of #10,543, making him
the second highest paid in Scotland behind Lanarkshire Health Board's general
manager, whose gross salary was #85,092.
He added: ``Our general manager was paid according to nationally agreed scales
which relate to other senior manager posts around the country, including those
in local authorities.
``His salary reflects the size of the area and the #575m revenue budget for
which Lothian is responsible and the fact that this a major teaching board.''
Mr Donohoe said: ``During the past four years the establishment of NHS trusts
in Scotland has cut the direct responsibility of health board general managers.
That reduction in their job remit has not been reflected in salary levels.
``The salaries of frontline NHS workers are being pegged at increases of 3% per
annum. Some general managers have been receiving increases running at four
times those levels. That cannot be justified.''

WEALTH and health are not necessarily guarantees of the most satisfying life,
according to a new study which rates Scotland as the second most attractive
place to live in the UK.
While conceding that the standard of living and prospects of longevity north of
the Border still leave a lot to be desired, the survey by the New Economics
Foundation and the Independent on Sunday places the Scots' life above more
traditional utopias including the South-west and East Anglia.
In the desirability stakes, Scotland, surpassed only by the South-west, was
found to have two not-so-secret weapons which allowed it to pass its rivals by.
They are the wide-open-spaces and standard of education.
By comparing population densities in 1981 and 1983, the survey's authors came
up with a population density index which Scotland topped by showing the
smallest percentage increase.
The second area in which Scotland ranked best in Britain was education. The
survey notes that people are more concerned about education provision than
employment prospects or wage levels.
Strong ratings in affordability of housing, culture, tranquillity, community,
transport, and environment also helped to make up for the more traditional
deficiencies.
Numerous quality of life studies have been produced since the '80s and
regularly gave conflicting results. The Guinness Top Towns survey rates the
South-east highly while Strathclyde University's highly respected Quality of
Life group suggest the Celtic fringe.
This latest survey hopes to overcome the various problems encountered by
previous studies, notably the difficulty of assessing environmental quality and
social and cultural factors.
For that reason, say the authors, the results have been produced on a regional
rather than city by city or town by town basis.
``Perhaps most significantly,'' says the report. ``There is a strong - though
not total - correspondence between the NFS/IoS rankings and inter-regional
migration patterns. The South-west experienced the greatest net inflow of
population in 1993, followed by East Anglia . . . and Wales and Scotland in
fourth and fifth.''

GORDONIANS made the long trip to Stranraer to face Wigtownshire as the only
team left with a chance of catching Glasgow Southern. They gave already
relegated Wigtownshire the obligatory 49-7 cuffing, with eight tries, but all
to no avail.
The other relegation spot was destined for either Edinburgh Wanderers or
Haddington.
The former have made a habit in recent weeks of losing narrowly, but at
Millbrae, Ayr looked to have it sewn up with an 18-6 lead late on.
Then Ayr found Wanderers taking a new lease of life, and with tries from Jon
Hussein and Ross Nixon, the Edinburgh side ran out 24-21 winners.
However, this was all too late to keep Wanderers in the Premiership, as
Haddington turned around a half-time deficit to win at Langholm. The Borderers
made a great start with the pack dominating, but three penalties, a try, and a
drop goal from Phil Hodgson sealed Haddington's victory.

HAVING done the business against Biggar last week, Kirkcaldy shot themselves in
the foot when they went under 9-5 at Peebles. Although still in the slot for
the second promotion place, and with the better points difference, they have
not only to win at home to Musselburgh next week but depend on Corstorphine, so
far without a point, beating Biggar.
Peebles took the lead with an Andre Bell penalty but Kirkcaldy got ahead with a
dynamic move off a failed Peebles kick to touch. The ball span along the line,
with John Mitchell crashing over in the left corner to give the Fifers a 5-3
interval lead.
The second half was balanced early on with the back rows of both sides taking
the plaudits - David Gray and Alan Cleghorn for the homesters and Kirkcaldy's
Andy Henderson particularly outstanding. Bell seized two penalty opportunities
to nudge the Borderers ahead and set up a closing five minutes of pressure from
Kirkcaldy. However, Peebles, who needed the points, held on for a famous 9-5
victory.
Two other sides needing the points were on view as Musselburgh took on
Grangemouth. The latter made the better start to be 11-0 up in 10 minutes,
Musselburgh fought back, and in a stirring second half they edged it 19-17.
Grangemouth go down with Corstorphine, who went under 48-8 at Preston Lodge,
who, despite the scoreline, impressed only in bursts. They scored eight tries
through Paul Fairweather (2), Stuart Payne (2), Paul Grant, Brian Sandilands,
Mark Hasty, and Scott McMillan but led only 19-3 at the interval and that was
much aided by two touchdowns in the last five minutes.

YOU know the old one about naming five famous Belgians. After Hercule Poirot
and Tin Tin, it becomes a bit of a struggle. The local Brussels joke currently
is that Willy Claes has made the job easier but that's probably too obscurely
Belgian for popular taste.
A variation on the theme can be found in Brussels these days on posters in the
Schuman metro station which serves the European Commission and the Council of
Ministers. The EU's three newest member states put them there to tell those
with time to look a little about themselves.
Each country's poster includes a mention of famous citizens. Austria's were the
most recognisable, at least to me. I think we all know who Nikki Lauda is. He's
the racing driver best remembered for setting his hair on fire.
Mozart is up there along with Sigmund Freud. Romy Schneider was considered
famous enough to rate inclusion but I must confess to being unfamiliar with the
paintings of one, Egon Schlele. Not surprisingly there was no mention of a wee
Austrian with the funny moustache who is still too famous for Austria's comfort.
Sweden offered Greta Garbo, Bjorn Borg, and the pop group, Abba. To raise the
tone a touch they threw in Alfred Nobel of prize fame. But August Strindberg
would not be my first choice as a writer for the simple reason that -
confession time - I had never heard of him.
Finland also had me defeated, along with most of my colleagues on whom I tested
some names. Be honest, hands up those who have heard of Akseli Gallen-Kallela.
He was a painter. Or a racing driver called Juha Kankkunen? How about Alvar
Aalto, an architect (1869-1976)? Very well, how about Aki and Mika Kaurismaki
who were, apparently, film-makers?
The first Finn to come to my mind was the former Olympic runner, Lasse Viren,
who was famous for taking blood transfusions just before a race. But he doesn't
rate a mention.
At least the Finns can be sure that most of us, even me, have heard of Jean
Sibelius. With all due respect to the great man's music, I can say that I sat
through a Sibelius concert in Brussels recently and probably won't rush to
repeat the experience.
All of which set me wondering about how we Scots would fare in naming a famous
five, come the independence revolution. We are, after all, only slightly
smaller than Sweden and Austria and our population is almost exactly the same
as Finland's.
Some years ago this newspaper carried a series of features on famous Scots. If
I recall correctly we decided that the most famous Scotswoman on earth was
Lulu. There was some dispute about this and an editorial review was ordered. It
was decided that the only woman more famous than Dennistoun's own was the Queen
Mother.
Some of us considered this decision a bit dubious on grounds of nationality.
Are not the royals, and only the royals, British by birth? I suppose they can
choose whichever nationality they wish as the occasion demands, witness
Princess Anne singing in received pronunciation at rugby matches about us being
a nation again and her son pulling on the Scottish jersey.
The most famous Scots are dead Scots, it seems to me. Burns and Scott and
Bonnie Prince Charlie and Mary, Queen of Scots, are contenders and pretenders,
all deceased. Robert the Bruce is not exactly a household name outside
Scotland. But we could probably argue a case for claiming the most famous actor
in the world, dead or alive, in Sean Connery.
Adam Smith, Alexander Fleming, and John Logie Baird are probably more acclaimed
now than ever they were in life. John Lennon showed the meaning of the global
village when he argued in the 1960s that the Beatles were more famous in their
time than Jesus was in his, which was undeniably true.
What of the Welsh? I asked a prominent Welsh broadcaster in Brussels to name
five famous Welshmen or women. Richard Burton was the first who came to her
mind. Then there was Dylan Thomas - ``and there's lots more,'' she said,
stuttering to a halt.
After a moment or two she remembered Shirley Bassey. I rejected Lloyd George on
the grounds that nowadays no-one outside the UK has heard of him. Ian Woosnam
is well enough known to the sporting cognoscenti but he's hardly in the Connery
class.
Come to think of it, there's always the Prince of Wales, but is he not at heart
English? Besides, after tonight's Panorama he could be eclipsed by his wife in
the fame stakes. She must now be the most famous woman in the world.

Kilmarnock 13,
Glasgow Southern 13
THE champagne remains on ice in the Kilmarnock clubhouse after their abject
failure to win the Division Four championship in style.
That they are now promoted, along with visitors Glasgow Southern, is possibly
reward enough but it would have been nice to see the league flag unfurled on a
sparkling Ayrshire afternoon.
Frankly, though, the home side were fortunate to secure even a draw as, with
the balance of possession and territory, Southern should have gone back up the
A77 with a barrel load of points.
A lack of punch in their midfield and some Herculean tackling by Kilmarnock's
defend- ers contributed to the lack of tries for the visitors.
Yet they must take more heart into Division Three than their hosts, who looked
a touch lacklustre and suffered from the failure of Philip Gordon to dictate
the game as he has apparently done all season.
The Kiwi stand-off kicked like a drain and any ball he released was
inexplicably taken back inside by Joe Hobson, who was swamped by the tireless
Southern back row.
There was grit and determination in great store, but there was not much rugby
to grace what should have been the league decider, as wrong options were taken
and the game became bogged down in the middle of the field.
It was Robin Carswell who opened the scoring, with Kilmarnock rampant, as he
barged over from a lineout 15 metres out.
The lead was stretched by a Gordon penalty goal, then just as quickly narrowed
by a similar score from Dominic Sharkey.
The home side never looked comfortable despite a 13-3 lead after Tony Finnigan
dived over for his ninth - and easiest - try of the season after Gordon chipped
with the Southern defence all at sea.
The visitors had other ideas about where the league flag should fly, and wave
after wave of attack led to a well taken try for Andrew Healy which Sharkey
converted.
Again it was Sharkey who levelled matters with his second penalty goal and, as
the seconds ticked away, we were left to ponder why Kilmarnock did not take the
advantage of a kick at goal. Honours even, and glasses raised none the less to
Division Three.
Kilmarnock - R E Stewart; A Finnigan, S Jenkins, J Hobson, P S McIntyre; P J
Gordon, J Sharp; A Mawhinney, D Campbell, G Smyth, G Duncan, R S Carswell, S
Bennett, A K Pattie, M Logan. Replacement - J Larmour for Bennett (67min).
Glasgow Southern - A Menzies; J Paterson, D Sharkey, A Richardson, M Guthrie; A
Healy, J H Kayne; A McDougall, R Anderson, G Walsh, I Smith, A Tunn, G Remnant,
S Simcox, S Aitken.
Referee - A N Lyall (Gala Star)
SCORERS: Kimarnock - Carswell, 1t; Finnigan, 1t; Gordon 1p. Glasgow Southern -
Healy, 1t; Sharkey, 2p, 1c.

COMPANY executives are urged today to tackle stress among senior staff and
offer them counselling because they are working long hours and suffering record
levels of anxiety.
A report by the Institute of Management claims that many of 1300 private and
public company managers questioned revealed they were working longer hours and
showed extreme anxiety over job security.
The vast majority of managers, particularly women in the 35 to 44-year-old age
groups, said they found their work stressful and complained of feeling under
pressure.
More than half of those surveyed expressed concern that the demands of their
work were affecting personal relationships.
Nevertheless, despite the problems, more than seven out of 10 managers said
they found their work was a source of satisfaction.
Calling on companies to tackle stress and offer counselling, Mr Roger Young,
director general of the institute, said: ``Despite successfully navigating
their organisations towards recovery, managers now face a double whammy -
greater job insecurity and longer working hours. These are leading to higher
levels of stress. The long-anticipated `feel-good' factor has simply not
materialised.''
Technological innovation is also putting a strain on managers, according to
Scottish-based career consultants Drake Beam Morin Plc, which claimed the
average manager now had an increased workload.
Mr Michael Marks, the company's Scottish director, said: ``Compared to five
years ago, the average manager is doing a job-and-a-quarter or a
job-and-a-half, in terms of workload.''
He said that with the introduction of personal computers and electronic and
voice mail, managers were having to tackle more typing, faxing, and office
administration.
Mr Marks said: ``This may be easier with new technologies and equipment but it
still adds to the manager's workload.''
He called on industry to consider the impact on staff morale and added:
``Service industries have traditionally had a large number of support staff to
handle a high volume of written and telephone communication.
``Before reducing the level of support, organisations need to consider and
carefully plan for the impact on staff workloads and morale.''
Elsewhere this week, a group of Glasgow's long-term unemployed will take the
Glasgow Development Agency-backed lifestyle health awareness campaign to
workers at Glasgow Savings Bank, one of the city's biggest employers.
The campaign is managed by Castlemilk Economic Development Agency, and Mr Ken
Wardrop, the GDA's executive with overall responsibility, said it was one of 19
Glasgow Works projects aimed at helping the long-term unemployed back into the
jobs market.
The campaign will be conducted by a team of eight unemployed people who have
been involved in the project since March.

THE Scottish Trades Union Congress is calling on the Chancellor of the
Exchequer to deliver a Budget for jobs and services next week.
In a submission sent to the Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the STUC is calling
for an emergency jobs programme funded by a reform of Treasury rules on public
borrowing, tougher action on tax avoidance, and a rise in the upper rate of
income tax to the European Union average of 55%.
A targeted #1.5bn investment programme in energy efficiency, childcare,
environmental projects, housing, and public transport would create up to 82,000
jobs, according to the STUC.
It claims that with the taxes generated by putting people back to work and the
resultant drop in unemployment benefits paid out, the net cost to the Exchequer
would be reduced.
The STUC is also calling for action to help Scottish industry, including a
doubling of Government regional assistance to #295m.
It is also calling for the restoration of benefits to all 16 and 17-year-olds
and the link between State retirement pension increases and earnings increases.
STUC general secretary Campbell Christie said: ``Last week's small drop in the
unemployment figures cannot hide the fact that mass unemployment continues to
be the biggest single social and economic challenge facing Britain.
``The focus of Mr Clarke's Budget should not be narrowly centred on the policy
of tax cuts; it must be focused on the generation of sustainable employment and
improved public services. We hope that the Chancellor will make full employment
his number-one objective in next week's Budget.''
Meanwhile, former Chancellor Norman Lamont has stated he is in favour of
reducing the excise duty on whisky and tobacco because of the drop in sales in
the domestic market.
He considers that the price of a bottle of Scotch is ``enormously high''
because of the tax element and that reducing duty should have a higher priority
than cutting income tax.
Mr Lamont made his views known in a television interview with John Foster, on
the BBC's Scottish Lobby programme, screened on BBC2 yesterday afternoon.
At the same time, he ``guessed'' that excise duties would increase by the rate
of inflation in the Budget.
Mr Lamont froze the duty on whisky when he presented his budget in 1993 after
lobbying by the Scotch Whisky Asociation.
He said: ``I was particularly impressed that sales of whisky domestically were
falling and also when one looks at it, the tax element in the retail price of a
bottle of whisky is now enormously high. I think we have a problem, not just
with whisky but actually with all the excise duties, both tobacco and spirits.
``Because we have been committed to cutting direct taxes each year the
temptation has been always to put up the indirect taxes more than the rate of
inflation.
``That's all very well but it can't go on forever.''
Asked what he would do if he were still Chancellor, Mr Lamont said: ``I think
there is a strong case for certainly freezing the duty and in the longer term
trying to get it down because I think we are close to a counter-productive
level and it is having an affect on domestic sales.''

<HEADLINE>Cavalry to the rescue Nuclear submarine in safety exercise off the Ayrshire coast</HEADLINE>

THE constant nightmare of every submariner is the thought of being entombed
alive in a stricken boat and doomed to slow death by oxygen starvation. Despite
major advances in technology, the possibility of collision, fire, or unexpected
mechanical failure remain very real potential killers for the silent service.
More than 170 submarines have been lost in peacetime, many with all hands, over
the past 90 years. Even since the advent of the nuclear age, at least two
American and two Soviet boats have gone down, their highly-radioactive reactors
and weapons adding to the risks for both trapped crew and possible rescuers.
Of these, perhaps as many as 85% ended up on the seabed in waters well above
the point where pressure would implode the hull. However, many men died because
rescue techniques had not been developed to the stage where evacuation of
survivors was possible at depth.
The Royal Navy has just completed 10 days of trials with a US system developed
with survival in mind. The Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle is the end product
of a Pentagon project dating back to 1967. Worldwide, it is the submariners'
version of the US cavalry, ready to come flying to the rescue - quite literally
- over the horizon.
The DSRV Avalon arrived at Glasgow Airport in the cargo hold of a giant US Air
Force Galaxy transport aircraft from its base at San Diego, California, and was
then transported by road to begin trials in the deep waters of the Arran Trench
off the west coast.
Avalon and its sister vessel Mystic are America's real-life answer to the
Thunderbirds. Each is on 24-hour standby for transportation to accident sites
anywhere in the world. From first alert at San Diego, a DSRV could be deployed
in Europe within 36 hours.
Each of the 37-ton vessels can operate at depths of up to 5000ft, although
successful rescues would not be feasible much below 2000ft. Most submarine
hulls would cave in at or before the 3000ft mark.
The vehicles are built with docking equipment which is rapidly becoming
standard through much of Nato and many other nations. Britain, Turkey, France,
and Italy are now equipping their submarine fleets with compatible escape
hatches and metal ``skirts'' capable of anchoring the DSRV in position while
crewmen are transferred from one boat to another.
The American DSRVs are state-of-the-art, equipped with sonar and low-light
cameras to find disabled submarines in murky water, and can rescue up to 24 men
at a time. It would take seven round-trips to evacuate the entire crew of the
average US or RN nuclear boat.
The US Navy team is prepared to carry out rescues on boats of any nationality.
Bulgaria, a former member of the Warsaw Pact, and Sweden, one of the Cold War
neutrals, have both begun to adapt to the docking standards. However, there are
problems of trust.
Captain John Milnes, one of the Royal Navy's leading experts and liaison
officer with other Nato navies, added: ``There is a willingness to share
technology on our part. But that has to be a two-way street. There has to be
some kind of trade-off. Development of the US DSRVs and our own British system
cost big bucks. Western navies in general have spent a lot of cash on rescue
research.
``The bottom line is that if we have a boat down off Russia or they have a boat
down in the Pacific, then time is of the essence if lives are to be saved. The
rescue operation has to be a team effort with full co-operation.
``The Russians may not be on our side politically or militarily but, in time of
peace, we should be talking to each other on issues of common concern. A
worldwide rescue network is the ultimate goal and that, surely, has to be in
everyone's interests.''
Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, its navy spent many years on detailed
mapping of the seabed, logging safe routes through underwater mountain ranges
worldwide. The Soviets also developed advanced propulsion systems which enabled
some classes of their missile and hunter-killer boats to operate at more than
30 knots submerged, much faster than any Western submarine.
These are among the items Nato would like to know about. Moscow still regards
them as strategic secrets.
The trials just completed were aimed at marrying the US DSRVs with the UK's
newest and largest submarines, the Vanguard-class Trident missile boats. The
second of the four V-boats, HMS Victorious, fresh from her missile firing and
sea trials, was guinea-pig for the exercise. She is due to accepted formally
into the navy in two weeks' time.
Britain already has its own stop-gap system of submersible rescue vehicles,
based at Renfrew on the Clyde. The LR5, a mini-version of the US craft, can
rescue between five and nine survivors at a time, depending on the depth of a
stricken submarine. There is also Scorpio, an unmanned and remotely-piloted
robot craft which can be used to transport food, oxygen equipment, and medical
supplies in pressure-resistant pods.
Both are, however, limited in range and endurance. It could take days rather
than hours to complete the lift of an entire crew. Captain Milnes describes it
as ``holding the wagon circle until the US cavalry comes galloping over the
horizon'' and the analogy is perfect.
Both of the British systems are operated by civilian companies under contract
to the Defence Ministry. They are backed by a constantly-updated data base of
offshore surface vessels capable of acting as mothership for rescue bids.
Victorious crewman Leading Mechanic Steve Rixon summed up the attitude of the
service. ``We usually operate in deep waters by the nature of our mission. If
something goes drastically wrong off the Continental Shelf, then there is a
bottomless pit below us. The sub would implode long before it touched down.
``But we also have to operate in some of the busiest waterways in the world,
leaving on patrol and returning from it. It is comforting to know that if there
was a collision, then somebody could do something about getting us back to the
surface. It's something we tend not to dwell on too much.''

Colombo, Sunday
AT least 160 Tamil Tiger rebels and soldiers were killed in fierce fighting in
Sri Lanka's north and east today as the army beat off stiff resistance to
tighten its grip on the guerrillas' northern Jaffna base.
State radio said troops who had thrust to within 800 metres of the centre of
Jaffna town in a month-long offensive repulsed a fierce rebel counter-attack
with air and artillery strikes, killing 60 guerrillas and wounding more than
200.
``Almost every building in the area had been booby-trapped,'' it said. The army
lost 12 soldiers in the clash and 84 were wounded, mostly by pressure mines
laid by retreating rebel fighters, it added.
But the guerrillas struck back with a fierce counter-attack in eastern Sri
Lanka, killing 38 government soldiers in an ambush as the troops patrolled a
railway track at Shanthiveli in Batticaloa district.
``Troops along with reinforcements engaged the terrorists and forced them to
withdraw with their dead and injured,'' a military spokesman said. ``(Rebel
radio) transmissions monitored indicated that terrorists suffered at least 50
killed and a large number wounded.''
One officer and 23 soldiers were wounded in the two-hour clash in the east.
In the north, state radio also said advancing troops captured the area around
the Nallur Hindu temple, close to the heart of Jaffna town, after resuming
their advance at dawn.
It quoted a senior military commander in Jaffna as saying troops were only 800
metres from the town's centre and would soon take it over, 10 years after
losing it to the rebels.
Air force planes destroyed several Tiger rebel camps, the radio added.
The rebels shot down a government cargo plane over the seas north of the Jaffna
peninsula on Saturday in an effort to disrupt the army's supply lines, and have
poured reinforcements into Jaffna for a final showdown with advancing
government troops.- Reuter

SCOTLAND'S main teaching union yesterday warned that it would mount strong
opposition to any proposal which could mean its members being paid on a
performance-related basis.
A plan featuring the ``super-teacher'' concept has been devised by the Labour
Party but is intended to be applied only in England and Wales at this stage.
Details were given by party spokesman David Blunkett during a policy forum in
Edinburgh at the weekend.
His Scottish counterpart, Mrs Helen Liddell, has said the scheme could be
discussed during talks with the Educational Institute of Scotland next month.
However, the union made it clear yesterday that it would fight any extension of
the super-teacher scheme, under which advanced skills would be rewarded with
higher salaries.
Mr Ronnie Smith, the EIS general secretary, said performance-related pay in the
private sector was ``a discredited mechanism'' and he knew of no evidence which
confirmed that higher salaries produced greater achievement.
The union, he said, would have ``clear and unambiguous opposition'' to such a
scheme, not least because it was extremely difficult to measure individual
teaching performance.
Mr Smith gave a cautious welcome to another aspect of the Labour proposal,
whereby teachers would be encouraged to remain in the classroom, rather than
moving into administrative roles.
That, he said, was reminiscent of the original aims of the senior teacher post,
which was introduced in Scottish schools several years ago but is now widely
seen to have become an additional managerial promoted post.
Mrs Liddell said yesterday that the Blunkett scheme had no bearing on Scottish
teachers at present and that the Scottish party was still formulating its
education policy.
``Everything is still in the melting pot. We are looking at all the options,
because it would be foolish not to do so.''

THE Democratic White House and Republican-led Congress agreed today on the
outline of a plan to balance the US budget in seven years, paving the way for
the federal government to re-open, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said.
The Senate passed and sent to the House of Representatives a one-day spending
bill to reopen the government, which had been partially shut down since last
Tuesday, and give Congress more time to debate and vote on a longer-term
spending agreement.
Republican budget leaders had earlier handed Senate Democratic leader Tom
Daschle a compromise plan they said built on a proposal offered to them by
White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta.
``We submitted a counteroffer. We think it is excellent. We hope they accept
it,'' Domenici said. He declined to give details except to say that it built on
one of two proposals made by the White House just minutes earlier.
Panetta told Republicans on Capitol Hill today that President Clinton would
accept the key Republican demand that the budget be balanced in seven years, if
Congress accepted his conditions.
With his latest offer Clinton backed down from his goal for slower spending
cuts to balance the budget in 10 years. The Republican-controlled Congress
wants to cut projected federal spending by nearly $1 trillion and cut taxes by
$245 billion, balancing the budget in seven years.
Daschle told reporters the offer recognised priorities of both sides. ``It's
our best, good faith effort,'' he said.
Of Panetta's two offers, Democrats said the least likely to be accepted by
Republicans was one which protected health care for the poor and elderly,
education and environmental programmes from spending cuts. It would also bar
tax increases on working families.
The first offer includes an acceptance by the White House of conservative
congressional estimates of economic growth - as long as they were tempered in
consultation with the White House and private economists.
The wording of the White House's latest proposal would inch the president
closer to a seven-year balanced budget. It specifies that Clinton would sign a
non-binding agreement about a seven-year timetable.
This is a shade more definite than a previous Democratic suggestion that seven
years should be a goal.
Earlier today, House Speaker Newt Gingrich refused to predict how long federal
employees would be out of work. - Reuter

A BOY was alive and healthy today after being cut from the womb of his mother
during an attack that killed her and two other children.
A prosecutor said authorities believed the killings were planned, and that
there appeared to be no relationship to drugs or devil worship. One person was
in custody on a kidnapping charge, but no one was charged with the killings.
Investigators refused to say where or how the baby was found, who was suspected
in the case, or even to confirm whether they believe the killer or killers
removed the child from Deborah Evans' body.
``There was a deep slash, an incision across the abdomen,'' said DuPage County
Coroner Richard R. Ballinger. ``You can take what's obvious.''
Another child, 19-month-old Jordan, was found unharmed, shaking in a back
bedroom in the apartment.
Ballinger said police were withholding some information to help their
investigation.
The baby, named Elijah by relatives, was found Friday, the same day Evans, 28,
and 10-year-old daughter, Samantha, were found murdered in her apartment in
this Chicago suburb, authorities said.
Police searching for Ms Evans' eight-year-old son Joshua found his body about
12 hours later in an alley in Maywood, about 10 miles away.
All three had been stabbed and Ms Evans was also shot in the head.
On Sunday, a memorial of teddy bears, cards, footballs, and basketballs was
propped up outside the family's apartment complex.

FORMER-communist Aleksander Kwasniewski took a slight lead over former
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa in a first sample of official Polish election
results.
If confirmed by complete final results, the outcome would be a humiliating
defeat for the man who did more than any other in Poland to bring communism to
its knees.
It would also reflect a trend of social democrat victories in eastern Europe.
The sample, taken by the private OBOP institute from 1018 out of 22,000 polling
stations, put Kwasniewski ahead with 51.3% to 48.7% for Walesa.
Earlier exit polls, which carry less weight, had consistenly put Walesa a shade
ahead.
Final official results were not due until this evening and the verdict could
still change, but the news was greeted with grim silence at Walesa's Warsaw
election headquarters.
``Of course we are all extremely pleased with this result and nobody should be
surprised by it,'' said Kwasniewski aide Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz.
Neither candidate reacted personally to the desperately close results, waiting
for further confirmation.
Walesa, invoking the pre-1989 struggle against Soviet-imposed communism, and
Kwasniewski, with eloquent promises of reconciliation and political stability,
had split the electorate almost equally, sidelining other political forces.
Few concrete issues of policy separate the two, who both support market reforms
and seek Polish membership of the European Union and Nato.
Despite Kwasniewski's efforts to draw a veil over communism and stress the
future, the campaign was fought largely over attitudes to the past.
Even many of those voting for Walesa did so reluctantly, wearied by his often
confrontational style, obscure language, and unpredictable political manoeuvres
as president.
Walesa argues that if Kwasniewski's Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) adds the
presidency to the government and parliamentary majority it won in 1993, there
will be no checks on its power and it will pack its own supporters into public
posts throughout all levels of government and the economy.
``We cannot let them lay waste our country,'' Walesa told supporters in the
Baltic port of Gdansk after voting there.
``One of our goals is to continue putting things in Poland in order. We must
separate politics from administration and local government,'' he said at
campaign headquarters.
In Gdansk, home of the Lenin shipyard where Walesa founded his Solidarity trade
union 15 years ago and shook the Soviet bloc, supporters circled in cars
trailing pro-Walesa banners. Others, defying a legal ban on campaigning during
the vote, hastily pasted thousands of posters.
Catholic cardinal Jozef Glemp, like churchmen across the country, made his own
feelings about Kwasniewski clear.
``This is a choice between two people and two value systems......a set of
Christian values and a system that I would call neo-pagan,'' he said after
voting in Warsaw.
While consistently hostile to Kwasniewski, the Church did not express a
preference for Walesa above other Catholic believers among the 13 contenders in
the first round.
Last week he reproached bishops for intervening too late but said their support
could be counter-productive as some might vote out of spite against the Church,
which has lost popularity in proportion to its growing wealth and influence.-

Watsonians 48,
Boroughmuir 35
THE premiership title was slipping away from Boroughmuir yesterday as they fell
victim to a fired-up Watsonians, for whom Gavin Hastings had a personal haul of
28 points, and with that defeat they no longer have the ability to control
their own destiny.
Three straight wins between now and the end of league business (Stirling County
and Heriot's are yet to come) would have made 'Muir champions.
But that Myreside defeat means that Melrose, who were not playing yesterday
because of international dispensation, remain top of the table and are close
favourites for the title in what still remains a three-horse race - Stirling
being a good each-way bet.
In front of a Sunday crowd of around 2000, Watsonians grabbed something
approaching control in the second half after trailing 18-13 at the interval.
It was fast, furious, and frantic stuff. Watsonians needed the win to guarantee
first-division rugby next season and, of course, for Boroughmuir victory would
have represented another step towards the title.
Neither side really achieved a solid platform to work off and this was
responsible for the harum-scarum nature of the proceedings.
Boroughmuir were already without the suspended Peter Wright and in the course
of the game lost Darren George (ankle) and Derek Stark (wrist). The most
serious injury, however, befell Watsonians' loose-head prop Tom Smith, who was
stretchered of with knee-ligament damage.
'Muir opened the scoring following that rarest of rare species - a Sean Lineen
chip - which Stark ran on to for the try. Bryan Easson converted.
Gavin Hastings had a couple of penalty goals and new recruit Iain Sinclair had
a try, converted by Hastings, to give Watsonians a 13-7 lead.
Easson trimmed the gap with a penalty goal and Boroughmuir went ahead with a
Neil Dickson try, chasing Easson's chip, and consolidated their first-half
standing with an Easson penalty goal just at the interval.
Watsonians' coach Peter Gallagher said later that his side had indicated at the
interval that they would win, and they were as good as their word.
Furious Watsonians' forward play took them to within yards of the Boroughmuir
line and two Hastings penalty goals saw them in front.
Hastings Sr then had a try for good measure and, with the game slipping away
from Boroughmuir, John Kerr stormed in for a try after snappy handling from
Hodge, Garry, and Scott Hastings. Gavin converted.
Another Hastings penalty goal and a try by brother Scott, converted by the
former Scotland captain, made it 41-18 and it looked to be all over for 'Muir.
Then the fightback began.
Easson had a try which he converted - 41-25 and still a long way to go.
David Laird had a try which Easson converted - 41-32 and Watsonians are not
looking quite so comfortable now.
Easson then added a penalty goal with just a minute left and there were just
six points in it.
Almost inevitably, with Boroughmuir running everything, a passage of handling
on their own line broke down, Garry pounced for the try, Hastings converted
and, three minutes into injury time, it was all over.
Boroughmuir coach Henry Edwards, who suffers more from hot-cold vapours of his
side than any man truthfully should, was - almost - speechless at the end.
``Beforehand I told them that, if we didn't win today, then all the work that
has gone before would count for nothing. Now we have to rely on other sides
doing us a favour.''
Watsonians - G Hastings; F Henderson, S Hastings, A Garry, J Kerr; D Hodge, J
Weston; T Smith, S Farland, A Kitle, S Grimes, C Mather, G Hannah, I Sinclair,
C Brown. Replacement - J Waddell for Smith (47min).

HERE'S a wee hint for the SRU: stop the cheques, lads. Seven-and-a-half grand
for that? Come off it.
What has really narked me about that performance, and I was getting the hints
about it even before the game, is that we were given excuses. The squad and the
coaches may call them reasons, but I think we were fed excuses, and the main
excuse was the one about coming off an ``easy'' club set-up to play an
international match in November.
What piffle. What unadulterated waffle. What a shambles.
Until you have done everything in your power as an individual in every waking
moment of your life to make yourself a great rugby player then you cannot claim
that the game you play in recent Saturdays has held you back.
Not until after you have weight-trained to oblivion, completed tackling
practice after tackling practice, practised touch kicking and all the other
skills of rugby until you are perfect at the game - and I mean perfect - can
you criticise the standard of rugby you play each Saturday. Every second of
every day has to be about becoming a better rugby player before you can feed
the public excuses.
I have toured South Africa and New Zealand as a Lion in the months of May,
June, and July and been stuffed. And that was at the very start of their
domestic seasons, when they had done little else but summer touch rugby.
But they had trained to greet us with all they could throw at us.
I have often talked up our rugby players, and slagged off our footballers. Our
footballers are lazy, but my goodness weren't there some lazy rugby players out
there?
How many of that team have given their lives to the game since the World Cup?
Come on.
How many? Some, I'm sure. But why do we still have to watch Scottish rugby
players who are not built like Arnold Schwarzenegger? How come no-one tried to
unsettle the boys from the South Seas with a bit of argy bargy? How come we
have some undernourished looking bodies, and some under-skilled looking
players, on an international rugby pitch? Sorry, but I just don't understand.
We have a problem in this country, and it's one that pervades all of our
sports. The problem is this: Actually, nobody really gives a toss about sport.
It is not high on the list of priorities.
Next week everyone will have forgotten about Saturday's game.
Do you know what the sad thing about this tirade is? I know that when Scotland
were humped the last two Novembers by South Africa and New Zealand, we were
comparing practically professional Southern Hemisphere players with amateur
Scots. That distinction has gone now.
From this unusual tirade I want to exonerate the coaches, because they have
shown us before, as individuals and a group, that they are as advanced as any
country in the world in their thinking.
I really believe that. I have heard Telfer say before that the players here
have to be led. All Scottish sportsmen are like that.
They'll do as little as possible to get away with it.
The team will now get much better. They'll peak later in the year as they start
to train properly, but, believe me, there is no justifiable excuse for that
disgrace on Saturday. Excuses won't wash.
Oh, and another thing. I've changed my mind about the money. Stop the cheques.
Put the guys on game-by-game contracts. And make it 100% win bonus!
I'm off into hiding now.

RAY Illingworth faces a major selection problem as a result of the first Test
wash-out in South Africa.
With two days lost and today's play in danger of going the same way, England's
bowlers could leave Centurion Park without having sent down a delivery.
And that means Angus Fraser, Darren Gough, Dominic Cork, and Richard
Illingworth may need to play against Orange Free State in Bloemfontein on
Thursday.
``If we'd had a hard work-out here, I expect we would probably have rested some
of the Test bowlers at Bloemfontein,'' said Cork. ``But I'll be hoping to play
in Bloemfontein and I expect Gus and Darren will feel the same.''
If there is no more action in the first Test, England will be left trying to
fit a quart into a pint pot at Bloemfontein. The only way of giving all 16
squad members a game would be to draft some of them into weekend club matches -
assuming invitations to ``guest'' are forthcoming.
South Africa plan to name their squad for the second Test this evening, with
teenage wrist spinner Paul Adams, who had match figures of nine for 181 against
England in Kimberley a week ago, perhaps being called up.
q AUSTRALIA'S Mark Taylor scored a century to set Pakistan a daunting target to
win the second Test in Hobart. Taylor anchored his side's second innings with a
defiant 123 to leave the tourists needing to score 376 in their second innings
to level the three-Test series.
Pakistan were 15 without loss at close of play on the third day, still needing
another 361 runs with two days left after dismissing the Aussies for 306 in
their second innings.
q.CAPTAIN Stuart Law claimed five for 26 as Queensland beat Sri Lanka by 46
runs in their limited-overs match in Cairns, Australia, yesterday. Sri Lanka
were dismissed for 162 in their tour opener replying to the hosts' 208.
Pakistan A 137 (Shadid Anwar 50; I D K Salisbury 6-39) and 115-5, England A 327
(J E R Gallian 62, R C Irani 58, N Hussain 52; Mohammad Zahid 4-67). In Multan.

LIZ McColgan is convinced that her seventh-place finish in the Tokyo Marathon
yesterday was merely the consequence of bad timing in her descent from altitude
training in Mexico, but inevitably the jury will remain out on whether the
Carnoustie woman is ready to return as a major force in international endurance
running.
Though just 10 metres behind the leaders with less than five miles to go, the
Scot finished nearly two minutes adrift, reduced to the role of also-ran as one
of the most dramatic finales to a women's marathon was played out on the track
where, four years ago, McColgan won the world 10,000 metres title.
Just five seconds covered the first three runners after the lead had changed
three times on the final lap inside the stadium, with one of those who had led
finally being relegated to third.
Victory, and a confirmed place in Japan's Olympic team, went to Junko Asari,
whose success in 2hr 28min.46sec. was her first since taking the 1993 World
title in Stuttgart.
McColgan finished in 2-30-32, the best time by a Briton this year, and with
Australia's double Commonwealth champion Lisa Ondieki among her victims, but
still short of the confidence-boosting quality of run which would warn the
world she is back.
Asari entered the arena just ahead of compatriot Mariko Hara, and Valentina
Yegorova, Russia's Olympic champion, for the final 400m. Hara, a 10,000m
specialist running her first marathon, surged ahead, but Asari regained the
lead with 150 metres left. Hara faded to third in 2-28-50 as Yegorova, winner
of this race in 1993 and '94, snatched second in     2-28-48.
Hara had spurted ahead when three Japanese - Asari, Ikuyo Goto, and Naomi
Yoshida (fourth in 2-28-56) tangled and fell on a slope with two-and-a-half
miles left.
Malgorzata Sobanska, the Polish winner of this year's London Marathon, was
sixth, 16        seconds ahead of McColgan who said she would talk to coach
Grete Waitz before deciding whether to risk altitude preparation again.
``I felt dreadful from the very start, but better at 30 kilometres,'' Liz
confessed to husband Peter after the race. Yesterday was her eleventh day after
having decended from 8500ft near Mexico City - the first day of the accepted
physiological optimum to capitalise on altitude training.
``The body undergoes a lot of changes - I felt awful myself when I trained on
Saturday,'' said Peter. ``Each person is affected differently, so it's clear we
should have come down earlier. Liz was in shape to run 2-30 even before we went
to Mexico. We've made a big sacrifice being away from our daughter for five
weeks, and I'm not sure if it warrants the risk, trying altitude again.''

FORMER world champion David Smith of Perth showed that he is still a top level
threat with a win this weekend in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun District Cashpiel,
held at the Galleon Centre in Kilmarnock.
Following a 4-6 defeat by Douglas Dryburgh in an ``A'' road clash on Saturday,
Smith recovered to qualify for the knockout stages from the ``B'' road, first
of all beating Brian Binnie's team, who themselves had put paid to the hopes of
reigning European champion Hammy McMillan.
Then Smith's team, which this year includes Warwick Smith at three in place of
Graeme Connell, gained revenge with a 5-2 win over Dryburgh in the semi-final
and followed that up with a 5-3 win over Keith Prentice in yesterday
afternoon's final.
To reach the final in this event, which is being put on by the Curlers'
Association, Prentice had beaten the new team led by Graeme Connell
convincingly by 7-2 in the other semi-final.

RECENT events and the successful cup run has brought much excitement and pride
to the community of Stenhousemuir.
Team manager Terry Christie has obviously come of age in the sense of his
career in soccer management. A successful team found a way to make his talents
visible to a national perspective.
Nothing new in this, or untold previously, but the reason for putting pen to
paper in this case derives from the ``Arena'' column of November 11.
The reasons for Christie's success screams from the page as it is rare to hear
such straightforward advice and opinion from a football manager.
Cliches and humbug are conspicuous by their absence. The burning issue at the
moment is the parlous state of Scottish football in the sense of our ability to
compete internationally whether it be at club level or as a nation.
Perhaps the problem is that we have too many of our best managers and coaches
locked into the lower divisions, only coming to public prominence when
outstanding performances all too occasionally strip away the massive advantage
of having money to spend.
Time and again we see our bigger clubs appointing recently retired players as
team managers in a vain attempt to turn around fading fortunes. Who loses out
when these managerial apprentices take on the major roles in Scottish football?
The answer is the journeymen coaches of clubs such as Stenhousemuir FC and in
my view the game itself.
Only these are not journeymen coaches, they are often seasoned professionals
with ability who are, in reality, performing weekly miracles with extremely
limited resources. They are not necessarily successful in the public eye
because success as perceived by the general public is an impossibility to begin
with.
Opportunity for these people is what is required and vision on the part of
directors of larger clubs to countenance the fact that there is an alternative
to appointing last year's Roy of the Rovers (no particular reference to Roy
Aitken meant by this). There seems to be no ladder of opportunity in Scottish
football and quick fixes remain in vogue.
I would not wish to decry the often strenuous and genuine efforts of recently
retired players, but surely many are being asked to run long before they have
learned to walk the managerial tightrope.
Scottish greats such as Ormond, Stein, and Ferguson achieved their great
successes after their boots had been hung up. I am not saying that Terry
Christie is a candidate for a major job in Scottish football, but I am saying
that he impresses me in what he says and in what he does and there are others
like him.
Who is to say that Terry and other unsung heroes could not achieve greatness
with one of our larger clubs? The glory boys have had their chance and they
have blown it. It is time to look inwardly for the talent which remains
untapped. It is time for us to place our faith in the bedrock of our
footballing culture and to trust the heart of our national game to provide the
heartbeat it so desperately needs.

I BEGIN by stating that I am not a fan of the ``Beautiful Game.'' Indeed, my
lack of interest as to the happenings (in the normal course of events) on the
field of play pales into insignificance beside that concerning its
personalities and internecine machinations.
However, owing to recent press coverage regarding instances of violence by
players, my awareness of the subject has been heightened.
Players (past and present) and at least one boardroom member of a particular
Glasgow club have been predominantly to the fore. I do not choose to take
issue, at this point, with the recent actions of Paul Gascoigne or the comments
made by Donald Findlay, but only wish to comment on the article published in
``The Diary'' on 14 November concerning Duncan Ferguson.
My understanding is that Ferguson was convicted of an offence by a court of law
and thereafter sentenced. This sentence was appealed and duly upheld and, as a
result, Ferguson is now serving a sentence in Barlinnie Prison.
On the above date I read in this newspaper not that Ferguson is causing
problems within the system nor trying to gain favour or privilege because of
his status, but that he supposedly displays an ineptitude for washing stairs.
The story has a ring to it similar to that of the Irish squaddie sent out with
a mine detector. That notwithstanding, and assuming the story is not
apocryphal, surely by printing it, The Herald is guilty of an offence similar
in nature to that which led to the conviction of Ferguson. An offence similar
to those which are being investigated at the behest of Glasgow's
procurator-fiscal, namely one committed off the ball.
Even if not apocryphal, the story is undoubtedly puerile, serving no other
purpose than to heap scorn on an individual who, in the absence of evidence to
the contrary, is paying his debt to society. It also gives credence to the
preposterous and arrogant statement made by Findlay ``No-one likes us. And we
don't care.''
May I conclude that I found the assault perpetrated by Ferguson abhorrent and
consider the punishment meted out fair. However, kicking a man when he is down
is just not on.

FIFE Flyers last night halted a disappointing run with a 6-4 victory over
premier division bottom-markers Newcastle Warriors. The Kirkcaldy club were
party poopers at the christening of Warriors' 7000-seat arena.
The win opened up a four-point cushion betwen the third-bottom Scots and the
North-east of England outfit and helped make up for only drawing 6-6 with
fellow-strugglers Slough Jets on their home rink on Saturday.
Mark Morrison's men held a 5-2 lead with eight minutes left, but second-bottom
Jets hammered home four goals in four minutes. Canadian marksman Chris Palmer
slid home the equaliser with 64 seconds left.
Dumfries Vikings slipped back to fourth place in division one with a 9-4
victory over Swindon Wildcats on Saturday followed by a 13-4 win at Billingham
Bombers last night with Neil Smith hitting five goals and Stephen Lynch three.
Paisley Pirates crashed to their third straight defeat, 5-3 at Guildford
Flames. On Saturday, Pirates lost 7-4 at Medway Bears in a rough-house despite
icing trialist forward John Ross from Sheffield Steelers.
Murrayfield Royals suffered their fourteenth defeat in 17 starts, 13-2 at
pace-setters Blackburn Hawks last night after having been stung 9-2 at
Bracknell Bees on Saturday despite holding a 2-0 lead. Results:
Saturday: Premier division - Cardiff 7, Durham 3; Fife 6, Slough 6; Milton
Keynes 13, Newcastle 4; Nottingham 14, Humberside 1; Durham 6, Slough 6;
Humberside 8, Basingstoke 5. Division 1 - Manchester 8, Swindon 2; Solihull 6,
Telford 7; Bracknell 9, Murrayfield 2; Dumfries 9, Swindon 4; Medway 7, Paisley
4; Peterborough 4, Guildford 9; Telford 6, Manchester 11.

THE best coaches and managers, in the tradition of the late Jock Stein,
continue to insist football is a simple game, but the evidence would seem to
show this theory cannot be entirely true. If it were such a simple game then
British clubs would be formidable opponents in the various European arenas.
The dressing rooms of many of our clubs must be pretty dense places, crowded
with simple minds if recent behaviour which has further tarnished football's
image can be used as a reliable gauge.
However, Scottish footballers, at least, are taking action to rid themselves of
the stigma that the game is a haven for lowbrows in which they can run around
on Saturday afternoons releasing primitive aggressions. If all goes well with a
project still in its infancy the Scottish game could be producing upstanding
citizens as well as outstanding players.
This year, for the first time, young players were required to attend a
residential course at Largs where they were lectured on the need to project the
correct image not only for their own benefits but also for the good of the
game. The initiative is the brainchild of Scottish Professional Footballers'
Association secretary Tony Higgins, who spends most of his time thinking about
ways to improve
HIGGINS has long believed clubs should assume greater responsibility for the
off-field behaviour and lives of their employees and in winning their approval
for his residential scheme he has taken a significant step towards creating
Scottish football's New Man. He will have an all-round awareness of his
profession and also a sharper sense of his responsibilities.
``What we have in Scottish football now is a tripartite agreement among the
SFA, the Scottish League, and ourselves and all of us pay for the courses,''
Higgins said. ``When a club signs a player under 21 he has to attend the
course. It is compulsory.
``More than ever there is a greater need for players to understand the extent
of the roles they must play. There has never been a time when footballers were
under more scrutiny than now and, therefore, their responsibilities to their
profession must also have increased.''
Higgins does not know of any other country with such a scheme in operation and
he has been asked by the Minister for Sport Ian Sproat for more details on the
idea. He met the minister in London last week when both were involved in talks
about the notion of having top sports people return to the classrooms and
encourage participation.
``Some sports like cricket and even ice hockey, for example, already are
developing plans designed to attract children to them and because we are now in
this kind of competitive situation, which might become more fierce now that
rugby is going professional and will want to recruit kids, we have to
respond,'' Higgins said.
``My belief is the players are our best salesmen and if we can have them go
back to schools and deliver the message that can only be to football's benefit.
That is why, at the residential courses, we put the players through the D and E
coaching licence which allows them to coach kids.
``Often players, whose profiles become higher, are invited back to the smaller
clubs where they may have started and if they are asked to coach a batch of
young players they can. It is important that they know something about the
coaching of kids.''
SFA and club backing for his scheme has shown the game rapidly is becoming
conscious of the outside agencies which are looking closely at behaviour and by
demonstrating a willingness to tackle problems concerning discipline the courts
might be less likely to intervene. While in residence the young players are
given wide-ranging advice from the proper ways to behave on and off the pitch,
their rights as professionals, their responsibilities to the game, and also the
benefits of being aware of diet and nutrition.
``People laugh when I say things like that, but these are not all areas in
which players are strong and yet they are important. They need to be
explained,'' Higgins added.
It is also Higgins' intention that a full-time education officer be appointed
even though he has been thwarted once already in trying to introduce such an
individual. There was agreement in principle with the authorities to appoint an
education officer, but the Football Trust's finances have been eroded and that
has put the job on hold.
``However, I believe the game needs an education department, but in the
meantime it will be necessary to have someone who can go round clubs talking to
players and offering advice on a variety of subjects while reminding them what
is expected of them. I believe the ethos of educating players as much as
possible has to be established.
``The residential course, which will be run again at the end of this season,
will survive, but it is also my hope that it should be the beginning of
something and not a end or one-off for players. These days it is not enough
just to be able to play. Footballers must also become more aware of how the
game is played, its mechanics if you like.''
The players' union also believe strongly that because football behaviour is
being investigated more often then ever before it is essential clubs adopt a
different approach in that they should look at and examine possible signings as
individuals and not just football players. ``I'm saying clubs should be more
responsible,'' Higgins added.
``I know I'm still selling the idea but we should be doing much more in
monitoring players as they enter the professional game. In fact, I sent a paper
to the Scottish League last year saying that we should be looking at ways of
using players maybe three to five hours a week as a community resource.''
BY that Higgins would like to see more players offering to help foster the game
in their own areas and he is pleased some clubs are already doing so. It would
be difficult to make such a scheme compulsory because most of the players in
Scotland are part-time, but even so some clubs operate on a rota basis sending
players out to spread the word.
The SPFA are also encouraged with the growing awareness among top clubs that
proper and more custom-designed training facilities are required and Celtic's
Tommy Burns is especially anxious to start on the infrastructure of a scheme
which would enable his club to combine the schoolwork of kids with their
football education.
Although Higgins says ``we are not trying to create university professors'',
his is an intriguing concept and might make for some entertaining post-match
conferences. ``Could you talk us through that goal,'' the new Gazza might be
asked. ``Of course, gentlemen,'' he would reply.
``I received a pass, overhit slightly since the velocity was 43.5 miles an
hour, and even though the deflection off a defender effected an alteration of
29 degrees in the angle of delivery I was able to compensate by increasing my
speed while also reducing the angle of my approach. I then absorbed the ball's
pace with my left foot and transferred to my right before deducing that the
goalkeeper had stepped half a metre too much to his left.
``It was a simple matter then of shooting into the space at his opposite side
before turning away to allow the appreciation of the masses to wash over me.''
Pretty soon UEFA might have to issue a new edict applicable only to Scottish
clubs in Europe: Only three members of MENSA may be fielded in European ties.
Whatever comes of Higgins' notions and plans he has certainly given a troubled
game food for thought and we should listen to him. This man makes sense.

THAT was disappointing. And that must be just about the understatement of the
season.
For the first 10 or 15 minutes we didn't see much of the ball and it's only
when you are out there that you realise just how physical these Samoans are.
They are hard, hard men. They fly up on you and hit you off the ball, but
that's an area that we have to look at. We have to get more streetwise.
That game showed without any doubt that the gulf between club rugby and
international rugby is vast. We struggle at this time of the year.
Later on, come the Five Nations' Championship, we have played a bit of district
rugby and that means that we've moved up a peg or two.
I don't know how it can be done, or how it can be fitted into the season, but
if we are to continue playing international opposition in November then we have
to find a way of bridging that gulf between club rugby and Test matches.
Maybe, in the future, international players will spend less time with their
clubs and more with the districts. I don't know, but every single one of the
Scots who played in that game on Saturday will tell you that they found the
pace, the commitment, and the sheer physicality of the game light years ahead
of what we have been experiencing since the beginning of September in the club
championship. Maybe district rugby is, indeed, the way forward.
The alternative is that if we still want to play November internationals, then
we do so against lower-grade opposition. That wouldn't do us any good
whatsoever. You're not going to learn anything about yourselves by beating
Spain by 50 points. We have to play the best, but we have to make sure that a
structure exists that allows the players to compete on level terms with the
opposition.
But I'm not making any excuses, and I'll say right now that we expected to win.
We were 15-8 up and you shouldn't surrender that kind of lead. We took too many
wrong options and it's going to be a case of getting back to the drawing board
and being honest with ourselves. We didn't play well and we have to get that
sorted out.
They scored two tries and we didn't score any. That tells its own story. We
should have put our bodies on the line for victory. When we got down into their
twenty-two, we should have scored. Richie Dixon, when he was coaching us at
Stirling County, called it the ``twenty-two mentality.'' Once you are down
there you shouldn't leave until you've scored. That didn't happen.
That was both a one-off game and a build-up for the Five Nations, but it was a
game we should have won.
The new caps played well. Rowen Shepherd played what I reckon must be the best
game of his career. Jim Hay did well under difficult circumstances coming in as
he did with injuries higher up the ladder, and Stuart Reid played just as he
has done for Boroughmuir since the start of this season.
I was disappointed with my personal contribution. I missed a couple of tackles
and had a couple of runs with the ball that came my way but that was about it.
Tomorrow night I'm playing at Llanelli for a British Isles XV against an
International Select. It's a testimonial game for Ieuan Evans, which must be
some kind of historic first.
I hear that I'm marking Jonah Lomu. That's the kind of tackling practice I
need. Not!
Finally, it was heartening to see that new captain Rob Wainwright is following
in the Gavin Hastings tradition of amnesia when introducing the players to the
Princess Royal.
Before the game on Saturday, Captain Bob introduced replacement winger Hugh
Gilmour to HRH as, er ... Shuggie Gilmour. Glad to make your acquaintance,
ma'am.

I HAD lunch with Kenny Milne, which was definitely one of the high points of
the day.
``And when,'' he posed, ``did Scotland last take the field at Murrayfield
without a member of either the Hastings or Milne families in their ranks?''
After much checking, I can tell you it was over 10 years ago - February 2,
1985, when the home team lost 18-15 to Ireland.
Late on Saturday afternoon it sunk in how much our national side has come to
rely on the Gavins, Scotts and Kennys, not to mention The Bear, for the
match-winning touch. That is not to say their replacements did not acquit
themselves with distinction, just that following in the footsteps of legendary
Lions is not so simple.
Rowen Shepherd, winning his first full cap, was delighted to receive a card
from Gavin Hastings wishing him well. He was perfectly entitled to be satisfied
with his performance.
``I wasn't feeling under particular pressure, but just running out was an
overwhelming experience. I dropped one high ball, the rest of the match went
all right for me.''
Shepherd is a solid last-line defence and his line-kicking is sound. He does
not, as yet, have Gavin's flair but very few full backs do. Rowen is unlikely
to be a one-cap wonder.
Taking over the kicking duties was Michael Dods, and his five penalties saved
Scotland from what would have been an embarrassing defeat. It was actually his
fourth cap, he came on as a blood replacement in Dublin last year - ``for about
nine seconds'' - and was at full back in two Tests in Argentina.
``But this really felt like my first appearance,'' the 26-year-old medical
sales rep admitted.
``They were a very difficult side to play against and I was relieved when the
first penalty went over. I actually came off a bit disappointed, having missed
two other shots at goal, one which just crept outside the post.''
Dods, whose brother Peter was a hero of the 1984 Grand Slam, left Gala for
Northampton earlier this season. The English club, coached by Ian McGeechan,
are favourites for promotion to the first division.
``It has turned out to be a good move for me. The club are going well, playing
pacy, open rugby, and I am enjoying it. They even let me have a few goal kicks
during the second half last week.''
Michael fully appreciates the concerns in Scotland about so many of the
international squad going south. ``It is a worry for the SRU, I understand
that. I felt I had to develop as a player and that moving to England was part
of that.
``Who knows, there may be conflicts of interests between English clubs and the
demands of the Scottish selectors in the future. I would certainly always wish
to put my country first. The decision on where I play will be taken season to
season.''
I predict Dods will gain a lengthy run in the international side. It was not
only his kicking which was impressive against the Samoans, he had one
try-saving tackle and a chip-and-chase which might have brought him a try.
Jim Hay is in his fifteenth season of senior rugby and was gaining his first
cap at the age of 31. But he is very determined to stay.
``It was a tremendous thrill and it all seemed to pass so quickly. I simply
could not believe it when the referee blew for half-time,'' he said.
``I know there will be several challengers for my position. What I have to do
now is get into the South team and use the district championship as a shop
window.
``I hope the South's game with the Exiles, which has been cancelled, can be
re-scheduled.''
Of course it should be. If Jim Telfer believes, and he reminded us of it again
after Saturday's match, that district rugby is ``best pathway'' into the
international side, then one of the most important games cannot be just
disposed of. To do that would make a mockery of the championship.
On Saturday's showing, the Scots need all the practice they can obtain. I
thought the Samoans were clearly the moral victors; two tries to nil tells its
own story.
They were also delightful guests. After the first game against Edinburgh they
cleaned up their act, the high tackles disappeared and, though they still fell
foul of referees, most of the penalties they conceded were for offside. With
the ball in their hands they made Scotland look utterly pedestrian.
Coach Bryan Williams was delighted, as he had every right to be. ``The only
thing which threw me was when I went out to give my half-time pep talk and all
the lights in the stadium went out.''
Sadly, someone switched them back on again.

THE letter from David Hill (November 13) contains a lot of sense and it is to
be hoped that it has been read by Scotland's football writers, who have set
themselves up as experts on the game and have only succeeded in brainwashing
the players into a state of fear and feeling of inferiority.
They are forever praising the Italians and went over the moon when a French
team took 27 passes to score a goal.
For heavens sake, I have seen Alec James get the ball at kick-off and put it in
the English net without any passes. Three or four waggles with his backside,
two side steps and that was it.
Italian football is a bore. Has it been forgotten that the Republic of Ireland
beat them in the World Cup?
We know there must be passing in a game but also there is moderation in all
things.
Can you imagine Bremner, Crerand, Baxter, Meiklejohn, McStay, McMullan,
Jackson, Dunn, Gallacher, James, Morton, Delaney, Johnstone, Waddell,
Cunningham, McPhail, and many more taking the field feeling inferior to their
opponents?
In a junior match this season, I am informed that Pollok were two goals down at
the interval playing one of the new-style formations.
They changed to 2-3-5 for the second half and won the game 4-2.
We could do with more managers changing their ideas and fewer bumptious scribes.

AS THE first day of seven timed special stages drew to a close in Leeds last
night, the main title contenders in this year's Network Q RAC Rally - the final
round of the world championship - had reason to be pleased.
Subaru Impreza team-mates, Carlos Sainz and Scot Colin McRae, were each well
placed to win the driver's title, with Subaru and Mitsubishi in line to claim
the manufacturer's championship. McRae led after the second stage. By stage
No.5 at Donington Park, Finland's Tommi Makinen, in a Mitsubishi Lancer, was in
front, with his team-mate Kenneth Eriksson second.
The Scot restarts today's leg of seven stages in third place, 14 seconds ahead
of Sainz, and appears relaxed.
``The difference between me and the leaders is down to choosing the wrong tyres
in Donington,'' said the Scot. ``But I am not too worried. Today we move into
the forest and the real contest begins.'' Bruno Thiry, fifth, led a quartet of
Escorts into the overnight halt, including Alister McRae, quickly readapting to
four-wheel drive and turbo-charged engine power.
He has narrowed the gap to within eight seconds of Malcolm Wilson, from whom he
has hired his car.
``The Escort takes a little getting used to but it is a fantastic car,'' said
Alister. ``I'm looking forward to the stages in the Scottish Borders today.''
Perthshire's Robert Reid, navigating for Richard Burns in the third Impreza,
endured a fraught first day. Damaged suspension and steering relegated them to
twenty-ninth but a spirited drive returned them to ninth place last night.

NEITHER James Murray nor the suffering of those he left behind when he died
because of injuries sustained while at work in a Glasgow boxing ring five weeks
ago have been forgotten, but the fighters and their people returned at the
weekend to support the world light-flyweight championship bout between Paul
Weir, champ no more, and ``Baby'' Jake Matlala.
Many of these fighters, the good ones and the scufflers alike, bowed their
heads on the day of Murray's funeral, yet they themselves were willing to climb
back through the ropes and run the same risks of serious injury, or worse.
Before Saturday's night's programme began, there was a subdued atmosphere in
the drinking shops around the Kelvin Hall. Innermost fears were being
repressed, although one or two of the older people making their way to the
arena did say they hoped ``nothing bad would happen.''
There is an unspoken code among the true disciples of the fight game which is
difficult to fathom, perhaps it is born of the same stuff which made the men
who went underground to gouge coal for our furnaces and fires a breed apart.
Living with danger and the prospect that the next blow can inflict serious
pain, physical and deep in the heart, tends to have a bonding effect, and while
fight nights have been bushwhacked by too many loud drunks and part-time
supporters, they are still too much of a lure for the strong, silent type who
know what it is to sweat and bleed for a living. They tend to watch with eyes
fixed on the ring and faces expressionless.
Perhaps it is merely wild imagination, but there seems to be something decent
and noble about these men and that they are becoming harder to identify in a
sport overrun by wheelers and dealers in snappy suits topped off with the sort
of flashing smiles which makes your instincts scream ``beware,'' merely
strengthens the notion these are honourable men.
If only we could have boxing without the spivery. If only we could have fights
without the risk of serious injury. Sadly, we never will and that is why it is
too hard to defend anyone's right to inflict the kind of punishment which
stopped several of the boxers on Saturday night.
One has to wonder, given the death of Murray and others, whether it was fitting
that the show should have been presented in association with Glasgow City
Council, and one has to wonder whether or not the city's Lord Provost, Tommy
Dingwall, knew which sport he was attending. His message in the programme had
him introducing: ``a full evening of the Sport of Kings.''
The wonderfully-named Lehlohonolo Ledwaba, from South Africa, was never in
danger of suffering anything more serious than a sweat rash in his
featherweight contest against Ricky Beard, who was a substitute for England's
Peter Buckley, who didn't show. An official whispered that apparently the
fighter had a spot of bother in Birmingham, where he damaged a hand while being
mugged for his jacket.
The incident did nothing for Buckley's reputation, and he certainly wouldn't
stand a chance in the competition which has been causing controversy in New
York City. In fact, he wouldn't even be allowed to hold the jackets in extreme
fighting, a barbaric event in which the fighters are governed by only two
rules: They can't bite or gouge eyes.
Everything else is allowed. Contestants can kick, punch, choke, knee, and beat
their opponents into submission. The basic premise is that two men enter the
ring and only one walks out. The loser is either knocked unconscious or
surrenders.
The legal authorities are appalled and are trying to ban extreme fighting,
which can be viewed on cable television. The promoters of this despicable form
of pugilism, Battlecade Inc, are determined to continue, even though their
bouts make even the bloodiest of boxing contests appear tame by comparison, and
their chairman, Anthony Guccione, claims: ``At the heart of this controversy is
the issue of free speech.''
Just a little off the mark there, Tony, when surely the issue is whether or not
it is morally right to allow men to pummel one another senseless, providing, of
course, the fighters enter the ring with any senses in the first place. Indeed,
one of the fighters, a crew-cut 210lb Greco-Roman wrestler, Gary Myers,
confirmed the lack of reason which surrounds this event, which I refuse to
described as sport.
``This is the greatest sporting event in the history of television,'' he told a
news conference the other day.
Myers was joined on the platform by 12 other extreme fighters, and they shared
three traits: short hair, Popeye arms, and surly expressions.
If extreme fighting is allowed to continue - and surely if television companies
were to think decency, rather than ratings, for once that might be the
beginning of the end for this human form of cock-fighting - it would be yet
another damning indictment on American society, but it should fill us all with
a sense of dread, because often the more tacky aspects of life in the USA
washes up on our shores like scum on the Atlantic tide.
There should be no doubt that there are among us people who would relish the
opportunity to stage extreme fighting events, but fortunately there is little
likelihood of that happening. Boxing remains under scrutiny and is still
fighting for its survival.
The truth may be that the noble art is not so noble any more; perhaps it never
really was. Boxing is on its knees and cannot take many more blows to the
heart, and after I watched another night of bouts, the feeling still persists
that the right thing would be to throw in the towel to prevent further injury.
It simply isn't right to watch people hurting themselves.

A NEW chapter in Scottish boxing opened at the weekend with the match featuring
the World Boxing Organisation light-flyweight contest between popular Irvine
boxer Paul Weir and South African Baby Jake Matlala.
The controversial ending when the bout was stopped in the fifth round was
greeted with amazement by the Kelvin Hall crowd. As Weir's manager Tommy
Gilmour said: ``I've cut myself worse with an electric razor.''
For the 28-year-old Scot, the defeat was in his sixth WBO championship match in
only his twelfth professional fight. However, Matlala has promised him a
rematch - on his own home ground. The 4ft 10in fighter is a hero in Soweto.
Naturally the first major boxing promotion in Scotland since the tragic death
of James Murray five weeks ago has rekindled the arguments about the long-term
future of the sport.
Opinions range all across the spectrum. Some would have a total ban imposed,
fearing that the risks are too great and the dangers of brain damage untenable.
Others dispute this, claiming the dangers are exaggerated. They fervently
believe that any move to ban boxing would simply push the sport underground and
make the risks even greater.
While these opinions, genuinely held, put many at loggerheads, few could
dispute the worth of one particular boxing club.
Every Saturday afternoon while some go to either football or rugby, a group of
dedicated women attend a boxing club at Strathclyde University. However, there
is one significant difference between them and their male counterparts. For
theirs is a non-contact sport. They may learn the combinations, but they don't
try them out in earnest.
As many as 80 have expressed an interest in the club and turn up regularly.
Their coach, Pete Harrison, has been in the fight game for a lifetime and has
worked with some of Scotland's leading boxers.
``I don't have any problem whether I am training men or women,'' he said. ``As
far as I am concerned it is just a body. There are plenty of benefits for the
girls, for boxing is not just about brawn.
``I used to have another class of women, which I had to stop. Many of those
women now say they realise what a good mental effect the training had on them.''
At Strathclyde the women are equally enthusiastic about the club. The convener,
Nicola Hawksford, said: ``I would be lost without the club sessions every week.
Of course, there are lots of other kinds of aerobic - step aerobic, tums, bums
and thighs classes. But they become so repetitive. This is so much better.
``It also gives you a certain confidence and the knowledge that, in a tight
situation, you would have a better idea of what to do.''
They go through all the same routines as the professionals. They do rounds of
exercises and often use medicine balls, punchbags, and skipping ropes. They
practise techniques and combinations, and build up their stamina and strength.
The club is as serious or as laid-back as they want it to be, although Pete is
not slow to tell them when they are doing something wrong.
As they dispersed after the club session, one woman was heading home for a huge
cream cake. ``After all, I think I've earned it,'' she said.
While Pete has to contend with his group of eager women boxers, he has also
another exciting talent to coach. His son, Scott, recently won the European
Under-19 championship at featherweight and has set his sights on the Olympics
in Atlanta next year.
But if opinions vary dramatically about boxing in this country, none could
sanction the ``extreme'' fighting contests being held in America. The basic
idea behind these shows is that two men walk into the ring and only one walks
out.
The loser is either knocked unconscious or surrenders. The event has only two
rules: no biting and no eye-gouging.
So while the jury is still out over the future of boxing in this country, we
can be proud that we haven't descended to the level of the ``extreme'' circuit
across the Atlantic.

SCOTLAND host the world championships next August and, following yesterday's
annual meeting at Strathclyde Park, the sport's national governing body, the
Scottish Amateur Rowing Association, faces this most challenging year in its
115-year history without someone in the role of secretary.
Moira Pow, of Greenock, stepped down yesterday as secretary and, lacking any
nomination to replace her, the association had no option but to leave the post
vacant.
Association president John McDougall said no plan to fill the gap had been
considered, but promised early action by the executive committee. The meeting
also heard of an appeal by International Rowing Committee chairman George
Warnock to ban three athletes from consideration as members of Scotland's
international teams, including Commonwealth bronze medalist Claire Smith,
because they had declined invitations to take part in this year's Home
International Regatta in Ireland. This will be considered by the executive
committee before a final decision is taken.

Scotland 15  Western Samoa 15
THE new-look Scots stopped the rot of defeat at the hands of November tourists,
but a try deficit of 2-0 tells its own technicolour story of moral victory for
the Samoans and a Scotland side which was badly out of sorts.
It matters not that this is the wrong end of the season for Scottish sides to
be playing Southern Hemisphere opposition. In an ideal world all Test matches
should be staged late in the season, when players are more properly attuned to
the demands that will be made of them, just as Southern Hemisphere sides are in
November.
But, for financial reasons if for no other (there were 42,744 at Murrayfield on
Saturday), the November game is a money-spinner which the SRU cannot live
without and especially so now that the players are to be paid. Potentially over
#7000 is available in one form or another for that one appearance, which begins
to look like grand larceny.
This was a poor display by Scotland and one which was especially galling for
the players, who are still in the midst of those contract negotiations with the
SRU. But on Saturday night that was a secondary consideration for most of them,
who knew that it was a game they should have won.
Scotland expected to have the lion's share of first-phase possession but, just
like Scotland A, they were counfounded in their expecations. This was
particularly so in the lineout, where Leavasa and Falaniko made a mockery of
Scotland's pre-match preparations.
The lineout is such a crucial source of possession these days that, when a side
is creaking on the touchline, then the disruption spreads like wildfire right
through the side. The lineout was the most tender of the sores which afflicted
Scotland but, right across the board, it was up front where Scotland's problems
began.
It is too simplistic to blame Weir and Cronin alone for Scotland's shortcomings
in the lineout. Success depends upon an amalgam of thrower-in, jumper, and
support players. There will, of course, be changes in this department before
Scotland take on the Irish in January.
Peter Wright will be back from suspension for one, and there will be more
competition for the hooking and lock berths once a straggling line of wounded
have been given the all-clear. Those 1990 Grand Slammers, Damian Cronin and
Paul Burnell, may just have played their last games at Murrayfield.
All of this does not, though, absolve totally the backs of some culpability.
Bryan Redpath had a generally sound game at scrum half. By contrast, his
half-back partner Craig Chalmers seemed, on occasion, to have lost the plot.
Early on especially, the Melrose man's line-kicking went awry and even with the
mixed quality of the possession which came his way, there was little evidence
of the pre-match plan to bring the midfield runners into play.
On the plus side, Rowen Shepherd had a solid, if unspectacular, game at full
back, indicating that he might, indeed, be the man to fill the Hastings boots.
Stuart Reid no doubt found the step up tough going, but certainly deserves a
second outing.
Mike Dods has four caps now but, having won one as a 60-second replacement and
the others in Argentina, this must have felt to him like the real thing at
last. He was one of the few successes in the threequarters and it was only his
five penalties which offered a degree of respectability to this Scottish
performance.
All of the foregoing has been to deny the Western Samoans credit for what
should have been an historic victory. In George Leaupepe they had a centre of
abrasive physical presence, scalding acceleration, and a roving eye for the
slightest of gaps. He was my man of the match.
Pat Lam, too, the Samoan No.8 and captain who has returned to the fold after a
brief flirtation with the Kiwis, is some player and, as he proved at the
after-dinner banquet, a speech maker of note, to boot.
The writing was on the wall early on for Scotland's lineout with three going
against the throw. The Samoans were penalised a couple of times which was just
the start of a dangerous liaison with the referee. They were on the wrong end
of a 17-3 penalty count. If they could have sorted that out then they would
have won on Saturday.
The tourists served early notice that they were not there just to make up the
numbers and when Dods kicked the first of his penalties after 12 minutes,
Scotland had already been on the receiving end of some quality Samoan running.
Dods put Scotland further ahead three minutes later when Lima took out Logan
late. From the restart Samoa were straight back to the Scotland line and
Kellett made it 6-3 when the Scots conceded a try-line, off-side penalty.
Ian Smith, the Gloucester flanker, was off a couple of times for attention to a
cut mouth, allowing Stewart Campbell to come on for his ninth cap.
Dods kicked his third penalty goal in 22 minutes after the Samoans were, again,
off-side at a ruck. Five minutes later the Scots drove lineout ball - won at
the tail by Wainwright - to midfield where Reid, running on to ruck ball,
guddled with the line in sight and a golden chance was lost.
After 34 minutes, Dods kicked his fourth penalty, the Samoans again offside at
a ruck.
The Northampton winger missed with a 25-metre penalty effort three minutes from
the interval and just on half-time Townsend chased a Chalmers kick which raised
the blood pressure within Samoan ranks but Telea won the race to the try line
to touch down.
Scotland led, unconvincingly, 12-3 at the interval but, after Kellett had
missed with a penalty attempt, the Samoans scored the first try of the
afternoon.
The Murrayfield floodlights had been extinguished following a 10-minute power
failure just after the interval. Leapepe's try fairly lit up the afternoon for
the Samoans.
It came in the forty-ninth minute, a short-range affair when the centre was
aided and abetted on his breenge for the line by Kellett coming in like a steam
train behind. The stand-off, though, couldn't kick the easy conversion which
with hindsight would have won the game.
Scotland weathered a period of stiff Samoan pressure on and around the hour
mark before Dods failed with one and then goaled another penalty kick. Although
they did not deserve it, Scotland were now 15-8 to the good and should have
been streetwise enough not to surrender the lead.
Two minutes from the end the Samoans took the Scots entirely by surprise as Joe
Filemu tapped a penalty under the Scottish posts and sent Kaleta in for a try
which Kellett goaled to make it 15-15.
In the final seconds Scotland had a chance to salvage the game with a Logan run
to a corner flag. Touch was given on the Samoan line, but French touch judge
Christian Zidel came on waving his flag. He indicated that the Samoans had been
guilty of foul play 60 metres upfield.
Scotland, from being poised on the Samoan try line, were marched back to their
own 10-metre line. Consternation among the crowd. What about advantage? South
African referee Tappa Henning explained later that he had actually blown for
time as the touch judge was displaying his ``misdemeanour flag.''
The only course open was to go back for the penalty because, from it, Scotland
could have won. They didn't, and if they had done then there would have been no
justice. Western Samoa had earned a draw, but they deserved to win.

WELL, well, well. The ``Supremo'' in Scottish rugby wanted smaller, competitive
leagues. He got his way by the clubs agreeing to a two-up-two-down system for
promotion and relegation and a 32-team Premier set-up.
Now he's not happy because two of the ``top'' clubs will be demoted and there's
no quality. So all the clubs have to be reshuffled again to try and keep these
clubs in Division 1. Why? If a club is not good enough to play at the top let
others try.
I'm sure Stirling County, Currie, Dundee HS FP, and Stewarts-Melville were all
glad to tilt with so-called top clubs when they went up to the first division.
How long will it take a club to get to the top under this new system? Are
Currie, Jed, GHK, and even John Beattie's much written about Glasgow Accies not
striving to be top clubs?
By all means re-organise if clubs want it, but not this year. Clubs such as
mine with ambition have invested time and energy to try and play quality,
promotion-winning rugby. It would be a betrayal to move the posts during the
season. Clubs must know what they are playing for at the start.
If play-offs are wanted then here's a suggestion, an automatic one up one down
then one play-off game between the second bottom and second top club which
might be exciting but will it lead to ``quality'' play? I doubt it. It's likely
to be high pressure, tense, and nerve jangling rugby.
The SRU should write to every league club with a sensible, well thought out
proposal to start in season 1996-97 instead of suggesting things for
journalists to interpret.

LIKE most supporters, I have been concerned about the situation at Partick
Thistle which culminated in an attempted sit-in following the game against
Celtic.
The rumour factory has been in full production. Why is there no money for new
players? Why were some players in dispute over contracts?
Forgive me for saying so but hasn't that always been the case at Firhill?
Nothing new there.
What has changed are the rumours that a certain group of businessmen want to
buy the chairman's controlling interest. Depending upon who you listen to,
these businessmen are either not interested, or waiting in the wings pens
poised over cheque books.
The supporters' federation are asking supporters to boycott the commercial
activities of the club and withdraw their custom from sponsors. This can only
damage the club.
Unlike the recent situation at a certain other football club in the East End,
it is by no means certain that anyone is interested in buying Partick Thistle.
People are now being asked to withdraw their financial support from the club on
the basis of rumours and speculation.
This, I would suggest, will do no good and cause only harm.
The protesters are putting forward no alternative to the present board of
directors, and unless and until they do, no-one should support the action
proposed by them.
Supporting Partick Thistle is never easy and never will be, but now is the time
for all supporters to back the club and reject boycotts.

PAUL Weir will be given the backing of the British Boxing Board of Control when
he bids for a rematch against ``Baby'' Jake Matlala, who took the World Boxing
Organisation light-flyweight title from the Scot under the most bizarre
circumstances in Glasgow's Kelvin Hall on Saturday.
A capacity audience watched bemused during the fifth of 12 scheduled rounds.
Weir had come away from a clash with the South African, complaining that he had
been butted, and when Puerto Rican referee Wiso Fernandez saw blood pouring
from a wound on the champion's right eyelid, he led the boxer to a corner and
called for the ringside doctor, Eamonn Brankin.
Despite advice from the doctor that Weir was fit to carry on, the official
signalled that it was all over after two minutes 36 seconds of the round. It
then took some 10 minutes before the official announcement declared Matlala the
new champion.
The rules state that when an accidental cut halts a fight after three rounds,
the judges' scorecards will decide. At that point, all three judges had the
South African ahead by 38-37.
Immediately, Tommy Gilmour, Weir's manager and the co-promoter of the event,
lodged an official protest with Gerry Woolard, who was the WBO's steward in
charge, and he will follow that up next week by flying to Las Vegas, where the
ruling body is holding a convention, to demand that Weir is given a rematch.
British Board secretary John Morris said: ``I will be writing a strong letter
to the WBO, backing Tommy Gilmour's claims. A little over a week ago we brought
in new safety measures, one of which allowed for a referee to seek the doctor's
advice, and for a doctor to make observations during rounds.
``In this case the doctor made it plain, through an interpreter, that the cut
wasn't bad enough to stop the contest, yet the referee ignored that. He was
totally out of order, and after that there could only be one decision. Matlala
had to be declared the winner, because he was ahead on points at that stage.
``I'm not arguing with that, but Paul Weir was not given a fair chance. What a
way for a champion to lose the title.''
Said Gilmour: ``It was disgraceful - I've given myself a worse cut shaving. If
the WBO do the right and proper thing, Matlala will be ordered to defend
against Paul, and back in Glasgow at that.''
Weir was bitterly disappointed. ``A head butt caused the injury, but, as you
can see, it is little more than a scratch. As the champion, I should have been
given the benefit of any doubt.''
``Baby'' Jake was also bemused by the premature stoppage. ``I have fought in
the past with both eyes cut and been allowed to carry on,'' he said.
``Certainly, Paul deserves another fight.''
There seems little doubt that common sense will prevail, but Matlala's manager,
Mike Segal, who comforted the Scot, will insist that the rematch takes place in
South Africa. ``It was all so unsatisfactory,'' he said. ``Yes, we are prepared
to give Paul another chance. However, I want that to be in South Africa. Would
February suit you, Paul?''
The little Scot rapped back: ``Next week will suit me.''
There was not enough action to predict what the outcome would have been. I
thought the champion won the first two rounds, but gave the second and third to
Matlala. Other results:
Middlewight - Willie Quinn (Tranent) beat Peter Waudby (Hull), retired end of
sixth. Welter - Gary Jacobs (Glasgow) beat Leigh Wicks (London), retired end of
third; Joe Townsley (Cleland) beat Kevin Toomey (Hull), rsc sixth. Cruiser -
Colin Brown (Glasgow) beat David Flowers (Canning Town), disqualification.
Light-welter - Mark Breslin (Barrhead) outpointed Paul Scott (Newbiggin), six
rounds. Super-feather - Hugh Collins (Stirling) outpointed J T Kelly (West
Hartlepool), six rounds. Lehlohonolo Ledwaba (South Africa) beat Ricky Beard
(Birmingam), rsc second round.
KEITH Knox, the unbeaten flyweight from Bonnyrigg, tops tonight's bill at the
St Andrew's Sporting Club when he meets Anglo Scot Louis Veitch in an
eliminator for the British title. These two little men of action will provide a
stirring contest, with Knox being a slight favourite.
Other Scots on the bill are Billy Collins, of Stirling, and Kirkcaldy's Gary
Burrell.

PERNELL Whitaker dominated his former sparring partner and fellow American Jake
Rodriguez before knocking him out in the sixth round to retain the World Boxing
Council welterweight title in Atlantic City.
It was his first defence of      the title since outpointing Glasgow's Gary
Jacobs at the same venue in August.
The champion knocked Rodriguez to his knees with a flurry of body punches
midway through the sixth round.
The challenger scrambled to his feet as the count reached eight, but a minute
later a right to the body put him down again, and the referee counted him out
with 15 seconds left in the round.
On the same bill, Felix Trinidad retained the International Boxing Federation
welterweight title when the referee stopped his scheduled 12-round bout against
Larry Barnes in the fourth.
Trinidad, who had a six-inch reach advantage, was in control all the way. He
hit Barnes with stiff jabs and combinations through the first three rounds and
rocked him late in the third.
Barnes was staggered with a left hook to the head midway through the fourth
round and went on to rain combination punches on the challenger.
Trinidad put his opponent down with a left hook and referee Benji Estavez
stopped counting at eight and halted the bout with just seconds remaining in
the round.

THE letter from Mr Alstead, of the Scottish Sports Council, makes a plea for
accuracy in statements (November 11).
The crux of the repeated statements by officials of the Scottish Sports Council
that they represent all those who use Loch Lomond for sport is whether they
supported the water skiers in their attempt to reduce the speed restricted area
from 150m to 50m from the shore.
If they in any way supported this ridiculous request they are serving only the
interests of the high-speed boat users and are quite clearly not representing
the interests of the real sports activities which are compatible with the
traditional and environmentally friendly uses of the loch.
The management of the Scottish Sports Council should resign if they have in
fact tried to support the water skiers in what is obviously a change which is
detrimental to everyone else.

A NEW production vessel being built for the North Sea is under threat from
``pirates''.
The threat is being taken so seriously that the barge which will tow her
through the hazardous waters of south-east Asia has been registered under the
British flag to allow her Royal Navy protection should pirates strike.
The Anasuria, the floating production vessel for the Guillemot and Teal fields,
108 miles east of Aberdeen, is nearing the completion of its accommodation
facilities and heli-deck at Nagasaki in Japan.
She will set sail for the UK next month via the Indian Ocean, Suez Canal, and
Mediterranean and on to Newcastle, where her topsides will be installed at the
Amec yard on the Tyne.
There have been a number of piracy incidents in the waters of south-east Asia
in recent years and in August there was an abortive attempt to board the Shell
tanker Stellata.
The tanker had to make a number of manoeuvres to make boarding difficult and
the pirates eventually gave up.
The Master of the Stellata told the International Maritime Bureau's Regional
Piracy Centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, that the vessel which approached them
was like something from a science fiction movie.
There was no trace of life, no portholes, no bridge windows, no visible doors
and no masts except for a small radar scanner.
It appeared to have been purpose built for piracy.
The bureau reports that the area of the South China Sea between Hong Kong,
Luzon, and the Hainan Islands is a continuing area for concern.
There were seven reported piracy attacks in the area during the first eight
months of this year accounting for more than an eighth of all such incidents
world-wide during the period.
In the light of such incidents, Shell is addressing the possibility in its
contingency plans.
``Pirates are working in this area and they are known to board passing ships
and rob the crew and plunder easily removable valuables such as electronics,''
said Mr Barry McClure, the turret engineer for the Anusuria.
``We have decided to register the barge with the UK Government for the period
including the tow during which the vessel will be sailing under the British
flag.
`` This means that, if necessary, any Royal Navy vessel operating in the area
could provide support.
``It is our understanding that if we notify the Ministry of Defence of our
planned tow route and this is being done through channels already set up by
Shell International Trading and Shipping, they will offer assistance to the
extent available in the unfortunate event of a pirate attack.
``There is no absolute commitment from the Royal Navy but if they have vessels
in the area at the time of passage by our tow then they will do their utmost to
provide aid if called upon.''
The #500m development of Guillemot, Teal, and Teal South is the first time
Shell has used a floating production and storage facility for the full
development of a field.
The Anasuria will be capable of storing 850,000 barrels of oil and it will be
exported by the shuttle tankers Petro Fife, Northia, Norissia, and Petro
Aberdeen which already serve Shell/Esso's Central North Sea fields. Production
is scheduled to begin towards the end of next year.

SHETLAND councillors may use their #6.3m stake in Shell to try to influence the
company's policies on Nigeria.
Convener Canon Lewis Smith said yesterday: ``If little Shetland Islands Council
can do anything to protest against an abuse of human rights then I think we
should.''
Canon Smith stressed he was speaking personally, as a churchman, and the
council had not yet discussed the issue: ``I don't know whether the best course
of action is to sell the shares or try to use our influence as shareholders
over Shell's environmental record in Nigeria.''
On September 30, the most recent date for which figures were available, the
council held 850,000 Shell shares in the holding company Shell Transport and
Trading Ltd.
The shareholding initially cost #4m and is now worth #6.3m.
Mr Drew Ratter, chairman of the Shetland development committee, backed the
council leader: ``Arguably, selling these shares isn't going to have much
effect on the share price but, if lots of people go to shareholders' meetings
and cut up rough, it might.
Shetland Greenpeace consultant Rose Young welcomed the prospect of a council
debate on the Nigerian issue: ``I'm very encouraged that they're looking
seriously at using their influence as a shareholder,'' she said.
Shell is the council's business partner in the Sullom Voe Association Ltd,
which controls the Shetland oil terminal.
No-one was available for comment at Shell's public relations office in London
yesterday.
Meanwhile, it was announced that Shell has sold the giant semi-submersible rig
it used earlier this year to clear Greenpeace protestors from Brent Spar.
The 15,500-tonnes Stadive - a diving support vessel the size of a football
pitch - is to be transported from the North Sea for use off the coast of
Brazil.
Stadive was the base from which police and Shell security chiefs raided the
Brent Spar tanker loading terminal after its occupation by Greenpeace.
Shell has sold the installation for an undisclosed sum to Safe Jasminia Inc,
which is based in Grand Cayman.
Stadive, powered by nine 27,000hp engines, has a maximum speed of five knots.
Shell said the vessel, which they have used in the North Sea since 1984, would
be delivered to the South American coast early next year.
Stadive is managed for Shell by oil company Subsea Offshore and has been used
for repair and maintenance work on rigs.
Mr Keith Allan, Shell's technical operations director, said: ``Stadive has
served us well. However, this winter she has become under-utilised.

<HEADLINE>No budging over US budget</HEADLINE>

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and the Republican-led Congress remained at loggerheads
today over the budget crisis that threatened to push a US government shutdown
into a second week.
The White House verbally rejected the latest Republican offer to get federal
employees back to work tomorrow. But officials said they saw some signs of
progress and hoped for more talks to quickly conclude the fight over a
short-term spending bill so the government can function while long-term
spending and tax plans are worked out.
``It's clearly going to require more negotiations,'' George Stephanopoulos, a
top Clinon aide, said on CNN in response to questions about the latest
Republican offer.
With Congress on hold through the weekend and no formal negotiations scheduled,
the two sides traded barbs while appearing on rival television network
programmes.
House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich refused to predict how long
federal employees would be out of work. Speaking on ABC television, he said the
government would not go back to work until the president accepted a seven-year
balanced budget, a cornerstone of the Republican revolution that brought his
side to power in the House after 40 years of Democratic control.
``We are committed to keeping our word with the American people, not selling
out to Washington pressure groups,'' the Georgia Republican said. ``It will go
as long as it takes.''
An estimated 700,000 workers would be on holiday next week if no agreement is
reached. Clinton has said he would try to find a legal way to bring back
offices that process social security, Medicare, and veterans' benefits.
``Today is the day to see whether or not there is a basis for resolving this
crisis,'' White House chief of Staff Leon Panetta said.
Panetta said earlier that the latest Republican budget proposal is a ``move in
the right direction'' but still does not meet Clinton's goals.
The plan would require Clinton to accept a seven-year balanced budget plan but
let outside economists review the conservative economic assumptions prepared by
the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Republicans earlier had insisted the CBO
would provide the final word on the budget plan.
Assumptions of future economic growth are important because a minuscle
variations between independent estimates can cost or save the government
billions of dollars over seven years in payments it makes for health care,
welfare and other programmes, and payments on the national debt.
The White House has previously said it would accept seven years as a ``goal''
but not as a binding commitment.
A revolt by Democrats late on Saturday prevented Republicans from closing the
House toorrow. Without Clinton's embrace of a compromise that would give
direction to Congressional Democrats to vote for it, Republican leaders were
powerless to push through their plan alone. - Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Bank governor quits over tax scandal</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NORWEGIAN central bank governor Torstein Moland, caving in to mounting pressure
to resign, said today he was quitting over a tax scandal that has haunted him
for several years.
Moland, 50, said he had informed Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen he was
resigning for personal reasons.
``There are limits to the amount of pressure I allow my family or myself to be
exposed to,'' he told a news conference. ``Enough is enough. I will now try to
find a new job.''
The opposition, which nearly felled the Labour minority government in a vote of
no-confidence last year over Moland, had renewed calls for him to resign after
he was ordered to pay a tax penalty last Wednesday.
Moland, who had said earlier he would step down temporarily while the tax issue
was being resolved, said he had not realised how strong the reaction would be
from media and opposition leaders after he was ordered to pay a tax penalty.
But the man who has headed the central bank since January 1994 said he had not
consulted Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland or Johnsen, who had been under
pressure to fire him.
Last Wednesday Moland was charged a penalty tax by Oslo tax authorities for
alleged gross negligence in a tax case which dates from 1990.
Norway's tax authorities have investigated allegations that Moland and dozens
of others illegally invested in a partnership used for financing purchases of
an Airbus passenger aircraft. - Reuter

IN ENGLAND.
ALL good runs must come to an end, though not normally by 7-0. That was the
extraordinary margin by which Blackburn Rovers brought to an abrupt conclusion
Nottingham Forest's unbeaten Premiership record, stretching back 25 matches to
last February.
More predictable was the contribution from Lars Bohinen, the Norwegian who
joined the champions from Forest at a knockdown price recently, thanks to a
clever clause in his contract governing the fee. He scored twice and reminded
Forest of all his skills.
So did Alan Shearer, scoreless after eight internationals following England's
game against Switzerland last Wednesday, but still far too good for domestic
defences. His hat trick gave him 13 league goals this season, second only to
Les Ferdinand.
On Saturday, Forest manager Frank Clark could point to mitigating circumstances
in having lost his two central defenders, Colin Cooper (injured after half an
hour) and Steve Chettle (sent off in the second half), and seemed prepared to
write the whole thing off as one bad day at the office.
It will soon be forgotten if Forest, Britain's remaining UEFA Cup survivors,
manage a decent victory at home to Lyon in the third round tomorrow night.
Blackburn will have to do without the ineligible Bohinen for their European
Champions' League match away to Spartak Moscow and may again rue the failure to
sign him, or someone of similar craft, during the summer.
How high they rise up the Premiership thereafter will be determined by whether
they can sharpen up sufficiently at both ends of the pitch to improve on a
dreadful away record of six defeats in seven games and only three goals scored.
Shearer was not the only renowned striker on song at the weekend. His England
partner, Teddy Sheringham, scored Tottenham's equaliser at home to Arsenal,
then laid on the winning goal for Chris Armstrong in the game that Spurs love
to win most.
The other derby brought delirium to the blue half of Merseyside as Andrei
Kanchelskis's two goals gave Everton their first victory at Liverpool in eight
seasons.
Les Ferdinand's typical charge through Aston Villa's defence brought a useful
1-1 draw for a Newcastle team temporarily off the boil, allowing Manchester
United to reduce the lead at the top to six points - which will become three if
they win at Coventry on Wednesday. United were three goals up on Southampton
before 10 minutes had elapsed at Old Trafford and went on to win 4-1.
Tony Yeboah ended a longish blank run with the only goal of Leeds' win at home
to Chelsea. At Selhurst Park, Juninho found Vinny Jones no more fearsome than
the Argentinians he recently saw off in Buenos Aires, and Middlesbrough took a
point in an uneventful goalless draw with Wimbledon. There was first proof of
the Brazilian's pulling power outside Teeside in a crowd of 13,780 which was
almost double the previous attendance.
Manchester City deserv-edly took their first belated away point in a 1-1 draw
at Sheffield Wednesday and can see some light, but dark clouds are building at
Bolton, where manager Roy McFarland was the subject of demonstrations after the
3-0 home defeat by West Ham.
And yesterday's 1-1 draw between QPR and Coventry made little difference to
their league positions. In the first division, Tranmere's 1-0 win over
Leicester yesterday prevented Mark McGhee's side taking over at the top from
Millwall.

WILL there be an election very soon? If not, perhaps there should be, for both
main political parties are behaving as if recourse to the polling booths was
imminent instead of being, as we must reasonably suspect, at least 12 months
away. It is obvious that we are already in a period of escalating
electioneering, yet it is the pace of the present political race which is so
surprising. Income tax is a core issue in any election. It is often the
ultimate target of an election campaign, the aim and the climax of all the
wheedling and promises that have gone before. Yet here we are, ostensibly a
long way from an election, with tax already at the top of the political agenda.
The Chancellor has the upper hand given that he can actually do something about
it, and Mr Clarke is adroit enough to produce a tax cut in his Budget speech
which will look as good as possible given the limited possibilities but which
will still be fiscally sensible. Mr Gordon Brown, on the other hand, can do
nothing about the actual rate of tax except talk about it.
For New Labour, talking about tax is more dangerous than impotence. The Tories
are desperate to draw Labour into the tax debate because they suspect that
Labour's thinking on the subject will lay it open to charges of tax-raising
once in government. Labour has resisted entrapment until now by pointing out
that without a good look at the books it is difficult to give details of
possible tax policy. This has been a sensible ploy, but only up to a point
because it must be tempered by a strong presentation of the theory and the
political and economic ethics which will underpin the details of any Labour tax
policy. That has been missing, which is a pity. Instead we have the Shadow
Chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, seemingly throwing caution to the winds and
proposing, when it can be afforded, to introduce a very low starting rate for
income tax. Mr Brown has several reasons for this suggestion, none of which is
terribly convincing. He says it will be fair and his desire to help the
millions of low-paid citizens is not in doubt. The problem for Mr Brown is
that, whereas a low starting rate of income tax sounds good, the succour of the
poor could more easily be accomplished by simply moving the point at which tax
begins to be levied. That is fair but does not make good headlines. Mr Brown
also believes that a low rate of tax would encourage people into work by
alleviating the poverty trap, yet every sensible study done in recent years
suggests that it is the benefit system which constitutes a poverty trap rather
than the tax system.
Tax cuts of the sort proposed by New Labour for the poor are a device for
propaganda purposes and should be understood as such. A more important subject
is thereby neglected. It is this: in any sensible and mature democracy the
state has to gather taxes to supply services to the citizens. Income tax is the
simplest, fairest, and most elegant method of carrying out this essential task.
It does no service to anyone to present income tax as a drag on the economy, an
impediment to national growth and wealth; yet this is what the leading
politicians of both main parties appear intent on doing. Both parties are
engaged in a contest to persuade the voters of their tax-cutting credentials.
This is a nonsense, for while nobody wants to be taxed unfairly or to pay more
taxes than necessary, the machinery of the state on which we all depend is
powered by taxes. Recent opinion polls have shown people opting for essential
services rather than drastically reduced taxes. They are right, and it is high
time that politicians were brave enough to agree with them.
