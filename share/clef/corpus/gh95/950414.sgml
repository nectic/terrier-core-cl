ROY Aitken, the man in charge of Aberdeen's immediate future, does not
expect to receive any favours from his old club when they come to
Pittodrie tomorrow.
The more cynical among football supporters will convince themselves
that Celtic and their manager, Tommy Burns, will arrive in Aberdeen
ready to hand their former skipper a lifeline.
But that, says Aitken, is not the way the game works. ''I don't expect
favours from anyone. I know what some people will be saying, but that is
not the way of the game.
''We are in a very difficult position right now. No-one has to tell us
about that. But we are there because of our own performances and we have
to get out of the mess ourselves.
''We won't get any help from anyone, and when you look at the game
coming up against Celtic, then you realise the position they are in and
you know what they have to do, and if we are to get something from the
match we will have to work hard to get it.
''Celtic will be coming here on a high after the semi-final win. They
also want to get into second place in the league, and the last thing
they will want to do is drop points.
''There will beno old pals' act -- and, to be honest, you don't look
for that.''
Aitken recognises that only by maintaining the level of performance of
the past few games will Aberdeen escape relegation.
He insists: ''Look at the way we have played in our last three games
and tell me how it is we took only one point?
''Honestly, you know if you are playing badly. You know if you deserve
to get something from a game or if you have let yourselves down. When
you are in this situation, then you don't kid yourself on.
''What we must make sure of now is that we don't allow the tempo of
our game to drop. We have to maintain our form and we can do so. If we
do, then we can still win the last five games and that could allow us to
beat relegation.''
Aitken remains convinced that his players are men who perform best at
a high level -- and a clash with Celtic at a sell-out Pittodrie comes
into that category.
At the moment he refuses to name a team, but there are strong
suggestions that Eoin Jess will, at last, be handed the responsibility
that a player of his ability should accept. He could start the game
after having spent too many matches on the bench.
Says Aitken: ''There are several players who are back in contention
after the reserve game the other night.
''We will be ready for this one, believe me. Everyone at the club
knows what is at stake and Celtic will know that we are ready for this
game. No matter how high they are after the Hibs games, we will match
them. We have to do that.''
Celtic could be without Peter Grant and striker Pierre van Hooydonk
for their journey north. Grant was injured against Hibs in the replay
and the Dutchman missed that match after having damaged a hamstring in
the first clash at Ibrox last Friday.
* CALEDONIAN Thistle manager Sergei Baltacha has been told a long-term
ankle injury will not put his career in doubt. After having seen a
specialist in Perth, the 37-year-old former Soviet internationalist has
been told that continued treatment over the summer should have him back
for the start of next season.
* FANS will be able to pay at the gate next Tuesday at Hampden when
holders Rangers meet St Johnstone in the BP Youth Cup final.

<HEADLINE>FA act quickly after unseemly brawl.  Heavy price to pay for Keane</HEADLINE>

MANCHESTER United midfielder Roy Keane could miss the FA Cup final
after he and Crystal Palace's Darren Patterson were yesterday charged
with bringing the game into disrepute following the brawl that
disfigured Wednesday's FA Cup semi-final replay.
Keane was sent off for stamping on Palace midfielder Gareth Southgate
when he reacted angrily to a high tackle from the Selhurst Park skipper.
Patterson was then one of at least three Palace players who confronted
and pushed the Republic of Ireland star as the incident threatened to
ignite terrace tempers already simmering after the death of Palace fan
Paul Nixon before Sunday's first game.
Both players face automatic three-match bans after referee David
Elleray sent them off for violent conduct, but the decision of the FA to
bring the disrepute rap could spell the end of Keane's season.
The #3.75m man is already out of United's next two matches after
receiving seven stitches in an ankle wound sustained in the first half
of the Villa Park replay.
Wednesday's red card -- United's fifth of the campaign -- means Keane
will be ruled out of games with Coventry, Sheffield Wednesday and
Southampton.
The Old Trafford side then have one more Premiership outing, at West
Ham, before their May 20 Wembley date with Joe Royle's Everton, but the
FA's prompt action indicates the ban could be extended to another two
matches, making Keane unavailable for the final.
In a statement revealing the decision to charge the two players, FA
chief executive Graham Kelly's tone indicated the seriousness with which
the incident was being viewed at Lancaster Gate.
''The two players were sent off on a night when the need for self
control was paramount,'' said Kelly.
''It is vital the FA takes a stand. It is no use condemning
misbehaviour unless we are prepared to act. We are.''
Kelly continued: ''The two players concerned disregarded the pleas for
good behaviour made by, among others, their own managers.
''I do not believe there can be any credible argument against the
action we are taking. In our view, there is a case to answer before a
commission.''
Palace manager Alan Smith, who attended the hearing with Patterson,
said: ''We have no complaints. The FA treated us fairly.''
Patterson could also face disciplinary action from his club for the
retaliation.
Smith said: ''There can be no excuse for what happened on the field.
It is the responsibility of everyone, including managers and players, to
show discipline.''
Both Keane and Northern Ireland international defender Patterson --
banned for one game earlier in the day for accruing 41 disciplinary
points -- have 14 days to respond to the charges.
Meanwhile, United's goal hero Gary Pallister urged both the players
and supporters of Manchester United and Everton to make the FA Cup final
a day to remember at the end of a season to forget for English football.
''Hopefully, we can now put everything that was bad about the
semi-final behind us and go into the final with only positive ideas,''
said the England centre-half.
''There has been a lot of scandal in the game and the players are as
fed up with it as the media and the fans. We don't like all the bad
stuff that's talked and written about the game.
''We'd love to see everything put behind us from this season and start
afresh. The final is the big showpiece of English soccer and hopefully
will go without any hiccups, on or off the field.''
Pallister is a paragon of good sportsmanship, having gone the first 49
games of this card-strewn season without the hint of a caution, before
the pace of Palace's Chris Armstrong twice tripped him into indiscretion
in the semis.
So he made no attempt to condone team-mate Keane's behaviour in
Wednesday's 2-0 win, beyond stating: ''We didn't want that sort of thing
to happen, but it was an FA Cup semi-final and players do get wound up
for these games.''
United's other scoring hero, Steve Bruce, said: ''We know everything
that's gone on over the past few days and nobody will condone what
Keaney did.
''We have to go and put our house in order a little bit. It's sneaking
back to the ugly old days and it's up to every one of us -- players and
supporters -- to put it right again.''
Bruce added: ''We want to get back to the way we were a few years ago
when we had stamped out the hooliganism which seems to be creeping back
in.
''Before the game we felt deep sympathy for the family of the lad who
died because, to come to a football match and lose your life is a
sickening thing.
''We all felt deep shame and we had to try and be a little bit
responsible and I know the flare-up didn't help.''
* TWO policemen were injured when fans tore up seats and threw pieces
of concrete during a violent cup match in Santiago, Chile.
The bitter rivalry between Universidad Catolica and Universdidad de
Chile boiled over when players began brawling after Catolica scored
their fourth goal in a 4-1 Libertadores Cup win and began taunting their
opponents. Universidad de Chile players lost their heads and began
fighting, leading to a brawl in which their goalkeeper Sergio Vargas and
Catolica midfielder Rodrigo Gomez were dismissed.

BUFFER strips around field margins can help reduce the risk of
pollution from chemicals and of soil erosion, crop systems expert Ken
Davies told a conference in Edinburgh.
He said buffer strips could improve crop and public access, avoid
pollution of waterways and bring benefits to landscaping.
He said many field margins has disappeared in the last 40 years with
the enlargment of fields and those that remained were often narrow and
limited in their ability to reduce pollution of surrounding habitats.
Modern agriculture inputs also threatened other habitats, such as
ancient semi-natural field margins.
''Apart from providing buffers between agricultural inputs and
surrounding environmental features, buffer strips may provide areas of
conservation interest, providing habitats for predators of crop pests
and for pollinators.''
But he stressed that much more research was needed into designing
these field edge strips to optimise their function.
While available information suggested widths of around 30m being
sufficient for most functions, better design may allow widths to be
reduced. He said in an average square field of 8ha, a 20m field margin
would account for 26.35 of the crop area. Rotational set-aside, designed
to reduce cereal crop production, occupies 15% of all supported crop
land and if field margins could be used as set-aside it could solve
perceived overproduction and provide a buffer for surrounding habitats.

SPECULATION continues to mount over the future of Rangers defender
Basile Boli, whose career at Ibrox has been marred by controversy.
But, last night, Ibrox manager Walter Smith said: ''We have had no
enquiries at all for the player. Several clubs have been mentioned, but
no-one has lifted a telephone to talk to me. There has been no talk at
all about a transfer bid for Basile Boli.''
So far Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen, from Germany, and
Fenerbahce, from Turkey, have been linked with the French international
defender. While the Turkish side say they intend travelling to Glasgow
this weekend to see Boli in action against Hibs and, perhaps, firm up
any interest they may have, Rangers don't yet know anything official.
Boli, himself, has never settled properly into the premier division,
and it would be no surprise if he moved on in the close season. It would
bring in cash and it would also take away one of the 'foreigners' as far
as the European Champions' League ruling is concerned.
Boli has maintained that his ambition is to win championship medals in
several different countries. He has done that with Marseille. Now he is
poised to follow that success with another medal from the premier
division. But his ambitions won't rest there.
He has told L'Equipe, the French sports' paper: ''I would like to play
in Italy in Serie A.''
Whatever happens, it now looks certain that Boli's uneasy flirtation
with Scottish soccer is heading for an end in the summer. Not because of
his constant media bungles but, quite simply, because he has not shown
the kind of consistency in our domestic game which Rangers require.
First, though, Rangers must receive an offer, even an enquiry, before
any business can be done.

WORLD champion Michael Schumacher and Britain's David Coulthard were
yesterday reinstated as winner and runner-up of the Brazilian Grand Prix
after their appeals against disqualification were heard.
But their teams were not cleared of using irregular fuel and their
points deduction from the constructors' championship stayed.
Schumacher's team Benetton and Coulthard's Williams outfit were each
fined around #130,000 by the sport's governing body, FIA.
Schumacher and Coulthard finished first and second at the Brazilian
Grand Prix on March 26, but were later disqualified when their fuel
samples did not match those that were tested at the start of the season.
The success of the drivers' appeal means that Schumacher regains the
lead in the drivers' championship from Austrian Gerhard Berger, of
Ferrari, who had been temporarily promoted from third to race-winner in
Brazil.
The appeal tribunal, which consisted of four independent
representatives from Portugal, Belgium, Greece, and the Netherlands,
reached its conclusions after a full day of evidence and consideration.
The outcome effectively means that the teams and their mutual fuel
supplier, the French company Elf, have failed in their appeals.
The drivers succeeded because it was ruled that they had no influence
on the choice of fuel supplied to their cars.
Flavio Briatore, Schumacher's team chief, and Frank Williams, head of
Coulthard's team, were present at FIA's headquarters to present their
version of events.
Williams team manager Frank Williams, who had earlier said his team
had a 50-50 chance of making a successful appeal, said: ''We are very
pleased that the drivers have been reinstated and that their effort in
the race has been recognised.
''Despite losing our points as a team, we are optimistic that we will
close the gap on our competitors for the championship. We have complete
confidence in our fuel suppliers Elf.''
The statement from the FIA made it clear that Elf's fuel had not been
found to be illegal, but that an error had been made in the procedures
surrounding the strict fuel regulations which govern the sport this
year.
It was because of this error that the teams were punished, but the
drivers cleared of any blame which would have affected the outcome of
the drivers' title race.
For Schumacher, the outcome will vindicate his claims that he knew
nothing of the fuel used and held no responsibility for it.
The result will also put him in buoyant mood for the next race, the
San Marino Grand Prix at Imola, later this month.
Coulthard was satisfied at the outcome. ''The most important thing is
that it shows, on the record, that I gained no advantage from the fuel
used in my car in the race in Brazil,'' he said.
Revised standings:
World drivers' championship: 1, Michael Schumacher (Germany) 14pts; 2,
Damon Hill (Britain) 10; 3, Jean Alesi (France) 8; 4, David Coulthard
(Britain) 6; 5, Gerhard Berger (Austria) 5; 6 equal, Mika Hakkinen
(Finland) and Johnny Herbert (Britain), both 3; 8, Heinz-Harald Frentzen
(Germany) 2; 9, Mark Blundell (Britain) 1.
Constructors' championship: 1, Ferrari 13pts; 2, Williams 10; 3,
Benetton 7; 4, McLaren 4; 5, Sauber 2.
Next race -- San Marino Grand Prix (Imola, Italy, April 30).

A LABOUR government would campaign for an end to farm intervention or
support buying and food export subsidies in a radical reform of European
farm policy, said Dr Gavin Strang, opposition spokesman on agriculture
and rural affairs, yesterday.
It would also concentrate its efforts in improving rural economic and
social welfare by creating jobs, building homes, improving public
transport and tackling rural crime.
These are the top priorities spelled out in a new rural policy
consultation document, A Working Countryside, just published by the
Labour Party in a bid to be recognised as the party of the shires. The
document promises something for virtually everyone in rural areas --
apart from those who hunt with hounds which the party wants to see
banned.
Cornerstone of this rural development would be the creation or
strengthening of regional development agencies throughout Britain along
the lines of those set up in Scotland and Wales by a previous Labour
administration.
In Scotland this would mean stronger links between Highlands and
Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise with a more active rural
remit.
The European farm policy (CAP) comes second only to the current
government as a target for Labour attack. The policy is described as an
unjustifiable waste of money with a 1995 budget of around #30bn.
''The CAP is also an ill-targeted investment. It offers little benefit
for our environment and provides incentives to farmers to farm their
land at maximum intensity,'' said the new document. ''The CAP no longer
even serves the interests of farmers and farm workers or of the rural
communities it was set up to defend.''
Dr Strang, who was speaking at a House of Commons news conference,
said that intervention buying and export subsidies took up about
two-thirds of the budget. It was also the focus of much of the fraud and
would be much better targeted at creating rural jobs and improving the
environment. He claimed other countries, such as Germany, were coming
round to this view.
The party had looked at the problem created by second home ownership
in rural areas, but decided they could not tamper with this. Instead
they would encourage the building of low-cost homes for rent in rural
areas where there was a social need.
John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, commented: ''Labour is
spearheading a drive to rebuild rural communities and recapture support
among the people in those communities. We no longer accept the old
notion of the traditional Tory shires.''

THE next two weeks will test the resolve of Ian Doyle as much as
players like Stephen Hendry and the boy who would be king, John Higgins.
Doyle, largely responsible for keeping snooker in the public eye, no
longer smokes, but as the matches unfold at the Crucible his hands may
start digging into pockets searching for the packets to calm his nerves.
The man who manages the world's top player and defending champion,
Hendry, and who has five other players -- Gary Wilkinson, Darren Morgan,
Nigel Bond, Alain Robidoux, and Ken Doherty -- from Team Sweater Shop at
Sheffield, knows more than anyone else that Hendry's dominance faces a
serious threat.
The menace comes in the shape of baby-faced Higgins, still only 19 but
already a special talent around the tables. He has won three ranking
events since October, #270,000 in prize money and a top-of-the-range
Mercedes, and is No.1 on a one-year provisional ranking list, although
the official list is compiled over a two-year period.
Hendry remains the top man and his prize money this year is #336,000.
For the past five seasons he has averaged winnings in excess of
#400,000. He set a record which still stands when he earned #695,000 in
prize money in season '91.
Endorsements can double a top snooker player's earnings, provided he
has the correct image and is properly projected. This is Hendry's tenth
appearance at the Crucible and in that decade he has earned aproximately
#4.1m in prize money and #8m in total. He also has an extensive business
portfolio.
Higgins was a member of Doyle's stable for a short period, but moved
out on his own before teaming up with Raymond Sparkes, better known as a
football agent. Even though they split, Doyle remains complimentary
about Higgins' ability.
''Undoubtedly he is a player who could win the world championship.
John is a great player,'' Doyle said. ''If he commits himself to the
game the same way Stephen has, then John will achieve the same things.
''However, I have to say that I feel there are one or two signs
showing that maybe, just maybe, John has a slight lack of
professionalism and he must remember one thing. He is a Scot and, while
he might already be king in his own mind, the English can be a devious
lot.
''The tabloids will be after him. They'll want to find something the
same way they tried with Stephen and that can bring its own pressures.
''Still, he is a very special talent and his mum and dad must ensure
their son is able to move along the right road towards the money he will
deserve. And, believe me, the earnings could be phenomenal.''
Hendry will move into a #300,000 mansion when he weds long-time
girlfriend, Mandy Tart, on June 30, but thoughts of that match must be
shelved for the next fortnight, otherwise he will be relieved of his
title. In fact, if there is a doubt about Hendry it must be that, for
the first time, outside influences could weaken his concentration.
''When Stephen's concentration is 100%, there is no one in the world
who can live with him,'' Doyle said. ''He is as dedicated now as he was
when he first started, and that is the great quality which every other
player must possess if they want to take anything away from Stephen.''
Hendry, who claims special affinity with the Crucible, has been
involved in some of the most dramatic matches that arena has staged. In
'87 Hendry was 9-1 down to Joe Johnson and pulled back to 12-12 before
losing 13-12, '88 saw him play Jimmy White who scraped through 13-12,
and in '90 he beat White 18-12 in the final.
The following year he met White in the final again and this time won
18-14. In '93 he set a new record of century breaks (12) before beating
White 18-5 in the final, and last year Hendry won 18-17 in the final
despite playing with a broken arm. Again, though, he broke White's
heart.
Pacing behind the scenes during the final frame, Doyle smoked a whole
pack of cigarettes. If he has to face similar trauma this year, he may
end up trying to light the end of his pen.
When Stephen's concentra
tion is 100%, there is no one in the world who can live with him'

THE hard work involved in remaining the world's No.1 snooker player is
beginning to tell on Stephen Hendry. By his own admission, ''practice
has become a grind'' for a young man who could find other things to do
with his time, but the motivation will return today as he begins the
defence of his world title.
The Scot explains his annual February slump by acknowledging that
no-one can maintain top form throughout the year. But his body clock
seems to know when the Embassy World championship is imminent, and his
batteries always are recharged for Sheffield.
With four world titles already, his ambition is to surpass the
post-war record of six held by Ray Reardon and Steve Davis. But the
young lions are hungry and snapping at his heels. John Higgins and
Ronnie O'Sullivan, both aged 19, have the skill and experience to be
serious contenders.
Having allowed Higgins to leave his powerful stable at Stirling,
Hendry's manager Ian Doyle has no hard feelings. In Doyle's assessment,
Higgins has more to his game than O'Sullivan. ''He also has a better
snooker brain,'' he added.
Higgins also has a refreshing humility which his cocky fellow teenager
lacks. ''I feel good,'' said Higgins about his prospects, ''so we'll see
how it works out.'' He begins against the experienced, if out of form,
Alan McManus. The fact that they are friends and prospective practice
partners will mean little when battle commences on Sunday and resumes
the following day.
Hendry opens his defence today against Stefan Mazrocis and should
clinch victory by the evening session interval. O'Sullivan will be
tested by Dave Harold.
John Parrott, back in form, is likely to emerge from the second
quarter of the draw after having accounted in the last eight for either
the hugely talented perennial runner-up Jimmy White or Sauchie's Billy
Snaddon.
The Scot first must meet Derby's David Roe on Sunday and Monday to
earn another crack at White, who last year gained some respect for
Snaddon when held to 6-6 until the Londoner won the last four frames.
The erratic James Wattana is the likeliest quarter-final opponent for
Higgins or McManus, and the bottom quarter features Ken Doherty and
Peter Ebdon. Davis should be waiting for whichever of them wins.
My semi-final forecast is Hendry v Parrott and Higgins v Ebdon. An
all-Scottish final is a real possibility, but I can envisage a change to
the script this year, with the winner coming from the bottom half of the
draw.
* LADBROKES have installed Hendry as the 10-11 favourite to win the
championship. Higgins is the 6-1 second favourite, with O'Sullivan 8-1.

THERE are times when it can be a tiresome business, this sports
reporting. Let us examine, for example, the inconvenience caused to the
70 or so racing chaps and chapesses from the media gang who had to haul
out their pencils, cameras, and microphones to trail all the way to the
Sussex Downs to spend much of the day in glorious sunshine having lunch
at Lady Herries' joint, a green paradise called Angmering Park Estate.
Lady Herries, the trainer of the most hyped racehorse for decades,
Celtic Swing, slums it in a pad that is part of 9000 acres of rolling
English greenery and it was to that little haven that she invited the
troops.
It is to her credit that when she decided to let the world hear how
the most exciting two-year-old racehorse in the world is progressing,
she did it with some style.
There may also be some shrewdness in the plan. Those who might be
inclined to cast a hypercritical eye over the embryo superstar, who is
favourite to win the 2000 Guineas, Derby, and St Leger, may be seduced
into more amenable mood by vol au vents, game pie, and the odd glass of
a claret from the well stocked cellar. Sitting in warm sunshine, sipping
an '86 St Emilion, with one of the finest looking racehorses in the
country posing elegantly on the lawn, the critical faculties might just
be mildly blunted.
However, it does seem to be the case that this unbeaten horse owned by
Peter Savill, a man who has put more than enough money into racing to
warrant owning such a champion, looks the part.
When a horse goes through his two-year-old career spreadeagling
opposition of all aspirations aside, inevitably he will be the subject
of inventive rumours over the winter before he tackles the classic year.
Celtic Swing is no different. Lady Herries' open house this week was a
splendid way of dispensing with all the nonsense. The horse has not lost
a foot, does not suffer from a wasting disease, can stand up, and has
trained on to be a fine-looking three-year-old.
That may be the easy bit, however. No-one can tell until he has his
first run, on Saturday week at Newbury, if that scintillating
acceleration is still there.
If it is, Savill, who will have the wishes of many Scottish racing
fans behind him, could realise a dream not achieved since Nijinsky won
the treble in 1970. Yorkshireman Savill, a multi-millionaire whose base
is the Cayman Islands, has long been a supporter of Scottish tracks, but
most of all wants to win Doncaster's classic, the St Leger.
His ambition will be matched by fellow northerner, Kevin Darley, the
jockey who has jumped to stardom on the back of his association with
Savill. The two have joined Mark Johnston, the Scot who trained last
year's 2000 Guineas winner Mister Baileys, in challenging the accepted
order at the top end of the business.
By the time the last leg of the treble comes around, in September, the
stable will know just how good Celtic Swing really is, but they should
realise that every racegoer in the country will be keen to see them
succeed.
The Flat racing scene desperately needs a crowd-pleaser, a star turn
who will transcend the betting end of the game, in the way that the
great steeplechasers, like Desert Orchid, have done. Talking of the
betting aspect, the bookies might as well wear masks and steal our
wallets if they expect us to accept 7-1 against Celtic Swing for the
Triple Crown. Anyone who takes a piece of that must either be psychic or
daft, maybe both.
Racing's history is littered with two-year-old wonder horses who have
flopped in spectacular style, but maybe this is Celtic's year. Tommy
Burns would like to think so.

THE Scotland Under-19 team for their Junior World Cup game against
Spain today in Bucharest shows six changes and three positional switches
from the starting line-up which buckled against Argentina on Wednesday.
Ayr winger Geoff Caldwell, who came on as a substitute on Wednesday,
starts on the right wing, with Alistair McLean switching to the left.
Prolific Stewart's Melville try-scorer Danny Bull is omitted from the
side and does not make the replacements' bench.
The centre pairing of Russell Kennedy and Allan Bulloch is switched,
with Bulloch providing more of a physical threat at inside centre.
At stand-off, Gavin Dalgleish is preferred to Gordon Hay. Grant Talac
and Jim Kelly are the new first-choice props. Ewen Boyd and Scott Murray
form a new partnership at lock, Murray switching from the back row, with
Alastair Cadzow coming into the back three of the scrummage.
Iain Fullerton, the 6ft 7in Kelso lock, who took some good lineout
ball against Argentina, could not be considered because of an injury to
his left knee.
Coach Alastair Christie said that the changes would bring more
physical presence to the side as well as freshening up the team
mentally.
A feature of all the sides in the tournament has been how the
opposition has been much more physically well developed than the Scots
youngsters, and this was certainly true against the Argentinians on
Wednesday.
Nevertheless, against the Pumas, the Scots did not do themselves
justice and the feeling among the players is that they are desperate to
atone for Wednesday's defeat and to make amends for the feeling -- in
their own words -- of having let Scotland down.
There was praise yesterday from the tournament organisers, FIRA, for
the spirit in which Wednesday's game against Argentina had been played.
FIRA had been desperate that there should be no repetition of the scenes
of mob violence from the Russians which marred the Scots' opening game
on Tuesday.
The organisers are also debating the advisability of sides playing
games on consecutive days, as Scotland were forced to do. No side which
has had to do so has won both times out.
Christie said: ''This has been discussed at a coaches' meeting and the
thinking is that next year it might be better to start the tournament a
day earlier. It takes a huge mental and physical effort for young boys
to play two international games one day after the other.''
Even although Scotland, with a win and a defeat to their name, have
slipped from the higher echelons of the competition, in which South
Africa, France, Italy and Argentina are now the front-runners, there
will be no easy games in the Scots' new play-off pool.
Today's opponents, Spain, have already defeated Scotland at Under-18
level within the past fortnight and they are not being underestimated by
the coaches or the players.
Christie and fellow coach Roy Laidlaw now have the task of building
confidence in the wake of Wednesday's defeat. Christie said: ''I was
hard on the boys after the game against Argentina because they did so
many silly things, but I would like to think that I didn't completely
knock the legs from under them.
''The theme now is one of showing that they have the character to
learn from that defeat and to come back with a good performance against
Spain.'' Team:
Scotland Under-19 -- S Tomlinson (Selkirk); G Caldwell (Ayr), R
Kennedy (Stirling County), A Bulloch (Hutchesons' Grammar School), A
McLean (Boroughmuir); G Dalgleish (Gala), G Beveridge (Peebles); G Talac
(Musselburgh), C Docherty (GHK), J Kelly (Harlequins), E Boyd
(Boroughmuir/Caithness), S Murray (Edinburgh Academicals), A Cadzow
(Boroughmuir/Caithness), S McNeill (Ross High), I Sinclair (GHK/Dundee
High FP). Replacements -- R Williams (Stewartry), S Jenkins
(Kilmarnock), J Weston (Watsonians), C Hunter (Currie), M Smith
(Watsonians), G Hodgson (Newcastle Gosforth), G Lambie (Edinburgh
Wanderers).

MONEY-SPINNING Wee River made it six wins from his past seven starts
with another classy performance in yesterday's #8000 Vaux Breweries
Sedgefield Champion Novices' Chase at Sedgefield.
George Moore's six-year-old is now bound for Ayr's Scottish National
fixture next weekend.
Moore observed: ''Our horse got a bit blinded when something jumped
across in front of him down the back straight. Otherwise he did
everything perfectly and I couldn't be more pleased.
''If he runs once more this term it will be in the #20,000 Edinburgh
Woollen Mills' Future Champion Novices' Chase at Ayr on Saturday week.''
Tragedy marred the John Joyce Handicap Hurdle, won by locally-based
Solar Nova, when Martin Brennan's mount What If fell fatally three out,
breaking her neck, while still in touch with the leaders.
Solar Nova is trained under permit by Teesside milkman Ian Park for
his wife, Carolyn, who certainly discovered the Midas touch on a visit
to the Doncaster Sales ring three years ago.
Said Park: ''Carolyn purchased three horses. This one has now won
three hurdles, Kinda Groovy has scored four times, and Mighty Express.
Considering the trio cost less than 7000 guineas between them, it wasn't
a bad day's work was it?''
Amateur Lorcan Donnelly received a five-day ban after having been
found guilty of improper riding in the opening seller. He finished fast
on 33-1 chance Owes The Till to take third place, beaten a head and a
neck behind 50-1 shot Denticulata and 9-2 favourite Keep Battling.
The Stewards decided that he had struck his mount ''with unreasonable
force and frequency, and out of stride pattern.''
* MARK Perrett, knocked unconscious in a fall at Worcester on
Wednesday, will be out of action for three weeks.
The jump jockey must serve the statutory spell out of the saddle
because he was concussed when taking a tumble during the Cromwell
Selling Hurdle which was subsequently declared void.
Perrett, who was taken to hospital, was back home yesterday after
X-rays found no broken bones.

FOR those of us who shivered through the snow flurries in last year's
final at Dunbar, the shirt-sleeved conditions at Royal Aberdeen this
week have come as a bit of a surprise. However, one thing has remained
constant -- Steven Young is still winning.
The 18-year-old, who is going for an unprecedented third title
success, notched up his twenty-first consecutive win in the Mobil
Scottish Boys' championship yesterday, the 5 and 3 victory over Brora's
George Duncan putting him into this year's quarter-finals.
While most prospective opponents share the feeling the Christians
might have experienced before stepping into the lions' den, today's
last-eight contender, Rob Douglas of Spey Bay, possesses a unique piece
of armoury -- he has beaten the Fraserburgh flier.
The victory, albeit not in a matchplay contest, came in the north-east
boys' strokeplay championship at nearby Old Meldrum last summer, when
hot favourite Young was displaced on the winner's podium by the
three-handicapper.
The defending champion will now get the chance to even the score in
their first head-to-head contest, one which Douglas, a promising
goalkeeper before a knee injury cut short his career, is keen to savour.
''Obviously, it will be difficult, but I'm looking forward to the
challenge, and at least I know I'm playing well enough to deserve to be
in the last eight,'' said Douglas, who also showed plenty of nerve
ousting Scottish cap Grant Campbell in yesterday morning's fourth round
before his last green fifth round win over Ryan Lumsden of St Andrews.
In the second quarter-final, Young's international team-mate, Chris
Kelly of Cawder, will face one of four Fifers into the last eight,
Stewart Whiteford.
The Lundin Links man already has the scalp of Scottish cap Paul
Cunningham under his belt and will be keen to add another.
Two other internationalists fell by the wayside yesterday. Oliver
Lindsay of Murrayfield lost to Kirkcaldy's Mark Donaldson 3 and 1 after
ending the adventure of 13-year-old Jamie Farmer in the morning's fourth
round.
In the last match on the course, Graham Fox of next year's host club
West Kilbride, fought back to force his tie with Neil Steven of St
Andrews into extra holes before the Fifer claimed victory at the
nineteenth.
Steven will now meet another player from the Kingdom, Fraser Hutchison
from Dunfermline, who won four holes on the trot from the fourteenth
before claiming victory on the last green, after opponent Simon Barron
lost his sand-wedge on the course.

LIKE virtually everyone but Ben Crenshaw, Nick Faldo had a
disappointing finish at the Masters last week, going from a stroke off
the lead on Saturday afternoon to twenty-fourth place, 11 behind
Crenshaw.
The Heritage Classic at Harbour Town Golf Links here in Hilton Head
Island, South Carolina, has been used in the past as a balm for those
bruised by Augusta National, and Faldo enjoys this tournament and golf
course, as much as anyone -- it was the venue of his first American win
in 1984.
But yesterday's opening round of the Heritage was a frustrating as he
shot a three-over-par 74 that included five bogeys and just two birdies.
Faldo's score was eight strokes off the lead held by Americans Gene
Sauers and Nolan Henke.
Faldo said: ''It saps you when nothing happens. I just need to drive
better. Driving and putting, if I can get those half decent, maybe I
have a chance.''
Harbour Town is a tree lined course on Calibogue Sound, just off the
coast of South Carolina. It has the tiniest greens on tour, making
chipping a crucial part of scoring. Four of Faldo's five bogeys came
from bad chips that left him with 10 to 12-footers for pars.
It seems incredible that John Daly should have been able to out-manage
Faldo yesterday, and out-score him by six strokes. Daly was just two off
the lead after a 68, playing the course with intelligence and restraint.
Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
66 -- G Sauers, N Henke.
67 -- B Kamm, B Tway, T Lehman.
68 -- J Daly, S Jones, G Kraft, P Micelson, S Lowery, C Pavin, B Ogle
(Australia).
Other scores included:
69 -- N Price (Zimbabwe), G Norman (Australia).
70 -- C Parry (Australia), J Parnevik (Sweden), D Love.
71 -- D Frost (S Africa), D Feherty (N Ireland).
74 -- N Faldo (England).
* SAM Torrance, the 41-year-old Scot whose target this year isto make
the European Ryder Cup team for the eighth successive time, was
yesterday struggling with a back injury on the eve of the Catalonia Open
in Girona, Spain.
Torrance, currently tenth in the Ryder Cup points table, hurt his
lower back last week and explained: ''My daughter Phoebe has not been
well and I have been carrying her around a lot more than usual. Then,
two days ago, I was in our local park and felt a stabbing pain in my
back. I could hardly lift my leg. I saw my physio and felt a lot better,
but I had to pull out of the pro-am today to have further treatment.''
Among his rivals this week will be David Gilford, who was joint
twenty-fourth in the US Masters.
* DAVID Thomson, of Kings Links, was again the leading Scot in the
Honichi Open in China yesterday after shooting a four-over-par,
first-round 76 to be six shots off the pace. Brian Dunbar (Easter
Moffat) and Garry Harvey (Grangemouth) shot 77s.
* A RECORD entry of 290 players for the Tartan Special Scottish
Professional championship -- 10 more than last year -- means that 220 of
them will have to take part in two qualifying rounds on May 4 and 5 at
Dalmahoy. From that competition 62 survivors will join the 70 exempt
players for the championship proper, to be held from May 18 to 21 over
the East course.
Andrew Coltart, who during the winter won the Australian PGA
championship, will defend the title for which he beat Gary Orr last year
in a play-off. Among his challengers will be Adam Hunter, who recently
won his first PGA European Tour title, the Portuguese Open. BBC Scotland
will televise the event on all four days.

AN injury to David Clark, the Stewart's Melville No.8, has forced
Scotland into back-row changes for the under-21 international against
Italy tomorrow at Bridgehaugh, Stirling.
Tam McVie, from Edinburgh Academicals, switches from wing forward to
No.8, and Stuart Grimes, the Edinburgh University student from Aberdeen
who played for the under-21s against Ireland in February, returns as
blind-side flanker.
Ross Brown, the Melrose centre who played against Ireland and France
under-21s earlier this year, also has been recalled as injury has forced
his club colleague, Iain Leighton, to withdraw as a replacement.
* DUMFRIES team for the Octocentenary Invitation Cup match against
Edinburgh at Park Farm on Monday (3.0):
G Oliver (Hawick); I Murchie, D L Murray, D Davidson (all Dumfries), T
Greenshields (Clarkston); S Welsh (Hawick), C Barbour (Dumfries),
captain; A Paterson (West of Scotland), M Hunt, P Reed (both Dumfries),
S McKechnie (West of Scotland), D Mellor (GHK), A Goldie, A Donaldson, D
Irvine (all Dumfries).
* FULL-back Gavin Johnson set a Springbok points-scoring record as
South Africa humiliated Western Samoa 60-8 in Johannesburg last night.
Johnson scored 28 points, including a hat trick of tries.

DAVID Webster, chairman of the Scottish Commonwealth Games Council,
who had put himself up for a second four-year term to steer through a
management review, was unexpectedly defeated in last night's elections
at the annual meeting in Edinburgh by his vice-chairman, advocate and
former Games shooting silver medallist Colin McEachran.
The voting was just 9-8 against him and by a similar margin the
long-serving secretary George Hunter, who is also an Edinburgh local
Tory councillor, successfully beat off a challenge from Louise Martin
from gymnastics.
In what appeared to be a three-way ticket with McEachran and Hunter,
badminton's Ian Brown was elected vice-chairman.
''That's democracy,'' said Webster, who will still be on the new
council as the immediate past president, and he is confident the
independent management review, which is due to be complete by the
summer, will still go ahead.
Edinburgh accountant Stewart Coghill remains treasurer as he was
unopposed.

: By MIKE HAGGERTY
SCOTLAND'S women fell at the last hurdle in their attempt to reach the
semi-finals of the Ford World championships here in Brandon, Manitoba,
losing 8-6 to the USA yesterday.
The Scots took the early lead with a single at the first end, but
crucial misses in the second end gave the USA a score of three and an
advantage from which the Scottish team never recovered.
Good play from the Scots in the second half of the game brought them
back to within one point at the eighth end, but the USA took a single
from the ninth and kept their nerve in the tenth to knock out a Scottish
stone from the house and the Scottish team from the championships.
Earlier, the women had beaten Sweden 8-6 after an extra end.
Scotland tied for fifth place overall, while the semi-final line-up
pits Canada against Germany and Norway against Sweden.
Scotland's men, led by Gordon Muirhead, beat Switzerland by 7-6 to
guarantee at least a play-off and the chance to go directly to the
semi-finals if they can beat England in their last round-robin game in
which they were 2-1 ahead after five ends and holding last-stone
advantage.
Against the Swiss, the Scots were in control from the third end.
Switzerland took the early lead with a single at the second. The Scots
scored three at the fourth to give themselves a cushion.
Switzerland scored two at the fifth, but Scotland moved further ahead
with three at the sixth. The Swiss fought back with singles at each of
the next three ends but ran out of opportunities. Details:
Women: Round 8 -- Canada 8, Norway 7; Switzerland 6, Japan 5 (two
extra ends); USA 5, Germany 8; Denmark 7, France 5; Sweden 6, Scotland 8
(extra end).
Sweden 0 0 2 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 6
Scotland 0 2 0 0 0 2 1 0 1 0 2 8

ROLLS-ROYCE will benefit by about #30m from a European airbus order,
the company announced yesterday.
German charter airline Aero Lloyd has ordered up to 22 Airbus A320
aircraft, powered by International Aero Engines' V2500 in which
Rolls-Royce is a principal shareholder.
The potential value of the engine business to IAE is around #90m of
which Rolls-Royce's share totals #30m.
Aero Lloyd is buying from Airbus two A320s and four A321-200 aircraft
and is taking options on a further four. It is also leasing from the
International Lease Finance Corporation a mix of 12 A320s and A321s.
The aircraft are all powered by IAE's V2500-A5 engine, already in
service on A320 and A321-100 aircraft.
The order also represents the launch of the higher gross weight
A321-200 which will use a new variant of the engine family, the 33,000lb
thrust V2533-A5.
International Aero Engines is a five-nation venture between
Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney in the US, MTU of Germany, Italy's FiatAvio
and the Japanese Aero Engine Corporation with an order book of over
$9000m.

A SECOND Slalom at the Scottish Seniors FIS Ski Championships on the
Nevis Range was yesterday won by Titti Rodling with her Swedish World
Cup colleague Kristina Andersson taking second place.
Although Emma Carrick-Anderson, winner of the first slalom on
Wednesday, this time took third place, she was far from outclassed by
the Swedish girls and skied to the same second-fastest time as Rodling
on the second run.
Rodling's first run lead was a comfortable 37 hundredths. While
Andersson replied with the quickest second heat time, Rodling and
Carrick-Anderson matched each other with an identical time only 12
hundredths slower.
In the men's slalom, James Ormond made his long journey from his
French home worthwhile as he won yesterday by a conclusive 2 seconds
over downhillers Graham Bell in second and Andrew Freshwater in third.
A third international FIS Slalom is now scheduled for today. Results:
Men's Slalom -- 1, James Ormond (Grand Bornand) 46.37sec, 48.87 (1min
35.24sec); 2, G Bell (Henley) 47.46, 50.16 (1-37.62); 3, A Freshwater

GRANGE return to European hockey this weekend after 11 years' absence
when they contest the finals of the A division of the European
Cup-winners' Cup in Sardinia, and they will find the opposition vastly
superior to that which they encountered back in 1984 in Vienna in the B
division of the European Club Championship.
This time they will face the cream of Europe -- gold-medal favourites
Harvestehuder (Germany), Real Polo Club Barcelona (Spain), and
Ekaterinburg (Russia).
But captain Colin Pretty said before Grange flew out to Italy: ''Our
season has been geared towards Europe and I feel we will do Scotland
proud.''
They open this morning against Polo Club, who are coached by England
internationalist Russell Garcia and are always tough opposition. But
Ekaterinburg could be less difficult now that Russian hockey is in
decline.
Heriot-Watt's task in the A division of the women's championship in
Holland is formidable. They could complete their group programme against
Tekstilshik (Russia), Slough (England) and Gronigen without a point.
Today's games:
MEN: Group A -- Polo Club v Grange, Harvestehuder v Ekaterinburg.
WOMEN: Group B -- Tekstilshik v Heriot-Watt University, Slough v
Gronigen.
Neil Menzies, coach of Scotland's senior women's side, yesterday
defended his decision to pull Susan Gilmour out of Heriot-Watt's
campaign in Holland and take her instead to Rome for a Four Nations
tournament.
He explained: ''This is a European Nations Cup year and I felt it was
much more important we are properly prepared for Amsterdam in June.''
The Scots open tonight against Germany, beaten finalists in Barcelona.
Their other opponents are Spain, the Olympic champions, and Italy.

AVIATION-to-oil group Hunting is emerging from its recent
restructuring with brighter prospects for 1995 in all three core
divisions, the company said yesterday.
Aviation was seeing some signs of improvement, the defence division
had a satisfactory order position and the prospects for oil were also
good.
The group reported 1994 pre-tax profits of #28.5m after exceptional
items against #31.7m previously. Turnover was #1226m against #1059m.
There were reorganisation costs in 1993 of #5.8m and losses on
discontinued operations of #2.5m. But profits on disposals came to #8.1m
against #1.3m in 1994.
Excluding exceptionals and discontinued activities profits were down
from #31.9m to #27.2m. The total dividend is unchanged at 10p after a
final of 6p on earnings per share of 9.2p against 5.7p.
Hunting shares slipped 2[1/2]p to 167[1/2]p.

Cleveland, Thursday
FORMER ladies' tennis world champion Monica Seles, who has not played
competitively since being stabbed in the back in Hamburg, Germany,
nearly two years ago, said today that she remains haunted by the image
of her attacker, Guenther Parche.
In a statement released in Cleveland by her management group IMG, she
explained her reluctance to testify at the appeal hearing earlier this
month in which a judge upheld Parche's suspended sentence.
''I was not going to turn my back on this criminal again,'' Seles
said. ''I am still haunted by the memory of seeing him behind me as he
attempted to stab me a second time in 1993. Why should I have to see him
again just to try to see that justice is done?
''I continue to be unable to understand the court's decision once
again to let this criminal go free.''
In a statement accompanying her decision, the judge said: ''We assume
that Parche's act is the reason that Seles is not able to play tennis
any more, but this cannot be said with certainty because Miss Seles was
not willing to testify in court.''
Gerhard Strate, the lawyer who handled the appeal for Seles, said:
''Monica sent a letter stating her feelings to the court, and her
psychologist traveled from Nevada to Hamburg to testify.
''The issue was not whether or not Monica can play tennis, but,
rather, that he stabbed Monica in the back and tried to kill her.''--AP.

Vienna, Thursday
THE Vatican today sought to defuse a row within Austria's Roman
Catholic Church by appointing a future successor to Cardinal Hans
Hermann Groer as Archbishop of Vienna.
A controversy over allegations that Groer sexually molested a
17-year-old former pupil 20 years ago had threatened to split the
church.
The Vatican and the Austrian government announced simultaneously that
Vienna suffragan Bishop Christoph Schoenborn, 50, scion of an old
Austrian aristocratic family, would be Groer's successor.
Church sources said the arrangement would allow Groer, 75, to delegate
all his responsiblities to his coadjutor and retire within weeks.
Under a concordat between Austria and the Vatican, the Holy See must
inform the government of senior church appointments. The government has
14 days to reject the appointment, otherwise it will go through.
Foreign Minister Alois Mock said the agreement was a mere formality
and the government had never rejected a Vatican appointment.
The allegations against Groer, who denies them, divided the church,
with some bishops openly calling for his resignation. A poll published
by the weekly News said 81% of Austria's Roman Catholics thought he
should quit.
Groer had already submitted his mandatory resignation to the Pope on
reaching the retirement age of 75. The Vatican has not so far formally
accepted it.
Other alleged cases of sexual abuse by Austrian clergy have surfaced
since a 37-year-old man told a news magazine that Groer had molested him
20 years ago.
Last Monday a priest admitted sexually abusing a 10-year-old male
pupil when he was a teacher in Salzburg in the 1960s.
Arch-conservative Bishop of St Poelten Kurt Krenn, one of Austria's
most controversial bishops, said on Tuesday he knew of ''one or two''
cases of sexual abuse by clergy in his diocese.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
POWER supplier Eastern Group did not meet its obligations to customers
when it imposed ''early billing'' at the start of the year, the industry
regulator has found.
Eastern has now agreed to ensure that customers who previously
received their bills early will be billed later in the present quarter.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of electricity supply,
looked into the early billing of customers at the start of 1995 after
allegations that Ipswich-based Eastern might make money from the move.
He found that it had not met its obligations to customers and
emphasised that the company should not profit from it. Delayed billing
this quarter is aimed at cancelling the cost to customers who may have
paid early at the beginning of the year.
Professor Littlechild said: ''Eastern explained to me that it did not
seek to profit from this change in billing.
''However, it is important that customers are assured that no such
profit has in fact accrued and I have therefore asked Eastern to take
steps to ensure that this is the case.''
Eastern told the regulator during the inquiry: ''Please be assured
that the revised billing arrangements which we undertook in January
affected only approximately one-third of our customers, and that those
customers whose bills were based upon meter reading were only charged
for electricity consumption up to the date of the reading.
''For estimated readings, where bills are based upon the period
covered by the invoice, there may in certain limited circumstances, as
with any estimate, be a small element of a charge for electricity not
consumed which is taken into account when the meter is next read.''
Eastern chief executive John Devaney said that it had ''the best
intentions'' and wished in no way to profit from the billing change.
''We needed to create this window to prepare for the introduction of
an improved quarterly meter reading service and regret the confusion it
apparently caused amnong some of our customers''.

<TEXT>
Detroit, Thursday -- Chrysler, target of a surprise and unwanted
$22.8bn takeover bid from billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, has
reported lower profits for the first quarter as the weaker economy
slowed the car market.
The number three car-maker earned $592m, or $1.46 per share, in the
period, compared with $938m, or $2.30 per share, a year ago, when demand
for its cars, trucks and minivans was soaring. Revenues in the latest
quarter were up slightly at $13.6bn from $13.2bn.
Chrysler cited lost production and costs associated with the
changeover to 1995 models, as well as the launch of its all-new
minivans, a leaner sales mix, higher material costs and lower sales in
Mexico.
Also included in the results was a one-time $115m charge associated
with a recently announced voluntary programme to repair rear latches on
its minivans.
''Our first-quarter results reflected an overall slowing in domestic
economic activity which has resulted in increasing retail incentives,''
said Robert J Eaton, Chrysler chairman and chief executive officer.
The surprise $55-a-share bid, a 40% premium to the car-maker's closing
price on Tuesday, came 15 years after Chrysler begged for and won
government loan guarantees to avoid bankruptcy.
Chrysler says it is not for sale. It said the proposal from
Kerkorian's Tracinda, which already owns 10%, amounted to a leveraged
buy-out that would require at least $11bn in new debt financing and
slash Chrysler's cash reserves by 70% to $2000m.
Joining 77-year-old Kerkorian in the bid was Lee Iacocca, the former
Chrysler chief who guided the the company back to profits in the 1980s
with innovative products like the minivan. Iacocca, 70, has no interest
in running the car-maker again.
Motor industry analysts and Wall Street experts were sceptical of the
offer and wondered if Kerkorian's real aim was to boost Chrysler's stock
and attract a foreign bidder so that he could cash in his stake at a
richer price.
Chrysler's worldwide factory unit sales in first-quarter 1995 were
714,765 units, compared with 740,598. -- Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Inflation indicators edged up in March Balance tipped in favour of May interest rate rise</HEADLINE>

THE March inflation figures were only marginally worse than expected,
but they underline the impression of a creeping deterioration in
Britain's inflation performance.
The City concluded that the figures tipped the balance in favour of a
0.5% rise in base rates to 7.25% when the Chancellor of the Exchequer
and the Governor of the Bank of England meet on May 5.
Sterling's 4% fall so far this year is the equivalent of a 1%
reduction in base rates. On the one hand it inflates input prices in
manufacturing, and on the other threatens to tighten capacity
constraints as manufacturers cash in on their enhanced international
competitive power.
An increase in base rates next month is widely seen as being
inevitable to compensate for sterling's weakness. Monthly economic data
have been studied for factors which might argue against a rate rise.
There was certainly nothing in yesterday's figures to do that, and a
good deal to cause concern, notably the extent of food price inflation
and the strength of household goods prices.
The retail price index rose by 0.4% to 147.5 between February and
March. As a result all three annual inflation rates edged up against
expectations that they would have remained the same.
Headline inflation, the measure most used in wage bargaining, rose
from 3.4% in February to 3.5%, its highest level for 2[1/2] years. About
60% of all pay bargaining takes place in the first four months of the
year. So this is the wrong time for inflation indicators to be rising.
Underlying inflation, the RPIX measure targeted by the Government,
which excludes mortgage interest payments, moved from 2.7% to 2.8%. It
was the third month in a row it had been in the upper half of the
Government's 1% to 4% target range.
The new RPIY measure, which excludes mortgage interest payments and
indirect and local authority taxes, moved up to 1.9% from 1.8% in
February, the first month for which this indicator was calculated by the
Central Statistical Office. For economists this is the purest measure of
inflation and is the one favoured by the Bank of England, the nation's
inflation watchdog.
The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is prone to extrapolating
short-run trends from official data in order to alert it to changes of
direction.
The three-month annualised RPIY rate edged up from 2.5% in February to
2.8% in March. At the time of the Bank's last quarterly inflation report
in February the three-month rate was just 1.6%, according to the Bank's
own calculations.
The Bank's next inflation report is due to be published on Thursday,
May 11, six days after the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor,
Eddie George, meet in the immediate aftermath of the local elections in
England and Wales.
Without a hike in base rates after that meeting the Bank would be
forced to conclude that the inflation outlook had deteriorated in the
latest three months, mainly because of the sharp fall in sterling. This
would put the Government's target of underlying inflation in the lower
half of its range at risk.
In February the Bank concluded that without the increases in interest
rates since the previous report in November its central projection would
have been for inflation to be in the upper half of the range.
On that occasion rates had been increased first in December to 6.25%
and then in February to 6.75%. The rule of thumb calculation is that
each half-point rise in rates knocks 0.25% off the inflation rate two
years out.
Between February and March food and household goods prices rose more
sharply than a year ago. Prices for alcohol, personal services and
household services all rose in contrast to falls last year. But there
was a fall in housing costs, reflecting lower house prices, in contrast
to an increase last year.
The most disturbing feature of the figures was the 1.5% rise (a record
for March) in household goods prices, taking the annual rate of increase
up from 2.4% to 2.7%. Household goods is the one area of retail sales
producing robust volume growth. The data show that consumers' price
sensitivity may be fading and retailers no longer need to resort to
aggressive price discounting to push up volumes.
The danger is that this could become a trend spreading to other
sectors at a time of pent-up factory gate price inflation as
manufacturers seek to pass on higher input costs and expand their
margins.
Clothing and footwear prices jumped by 1.4% between February and
March, but this was in line with last year, and the annual rate of
decline remained at 0.7%.
Food prices sported a monthly gain of 0.7%. James Capel's Adam Cole
said that food prices, particularly seasonal food prices, continued to
add significantly to inflation. Food price inflation edged up from 3.2%
in February to 3.3% last month. Seasonal food prices were 12.9% higher
than a year earlier. Potatoes are costing 37% more than a year ago,
mainly because of the European floods earlier this year.
Service sector inflation edged up from 3.4% to 3.5%. Cole summed up
the figures: ''While these data do not dramatically change the outlook
for inflation over the next year, they leave an interest rate increase
in May, in response to sterling's recent weakness, highly likely.''

GLASGOW Tigers get a taste of the big time at Shawfield tonight, and
it promises to be one of haute cuisine. Wolverhampton serve up the
opposition with 1993 world champion Sam Ermolenko and former Swedish
title-holder Peter Karlsson fronting a formidable line-up.
Wolves were third in the first division in 1994, while Tigers landed
the Division 2 title for a second successive year. Both teams now find
themselves in the Premier League, a 21-club amalgamation.
Glasgow's last home league defeat was as far back as 1991, and they
have won all three starts this campaign. Wolves have lost twice this
year -- both times to Cradley Heath in challenge matches. Since then
they have beaten Coventry and Edinburgh.
At Powderhall tonight, Edinburgh Monarchs hope to welcome Danish
Under-21 internationalist Robert Larsen to their side against Swindon
Robins.
Monarchs' Kenny McKinna narrowly missed out on qualifying from the
World championship semi-final at Middlesbrough last night. McKinna,
returning after a neck injury, scored eight points but failed to secure
one of the six qualifying places for the British final. Monarchs
team-mates Scott Lamb (6) and Les Collins (5) also missed out.

<HEADLINE>Trade gap narrows to #1143m</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with the rest of the world narrowed to
#1143m in January from February's revised #1639m but was still higher
than market projections which had centred on #700m to #800m.
As already published last month, the deficit with the non-EU countries
fell significantly in January to #292m from December's ''erratic'' #936m
and since then a February deficit of #343m has also been reported, now
revised down to #330m.
A feature of the January world visible trade balance, therefore, is
the rise in the gap with the EU to #851m from December's #703m, the
biggest since August 1990 when it was #1000m. There are also signs that
the best may now be behind the UK so far as the visible trading picture
is concerned.
Financial markets, though, took little notice of the trading data,
more concerned with the figures for UK inflation and US economic data.
Trade is, anyway, alway open to considerable revision, especially when
the invisibles from City services and overseas investment come into the
equation to give the current account balance.
As it is, the EU and non-EU figures have had to be adjusted to reflect
the inclusion of Sweden, Finland and Austria in the EU and further
adjustments are likely. One month's figures in isolation, moreover, will
always be suspect as the authorities continually stress -- especially
when they are particularly unfavourable.
In the three months to January, the visible deficit rose from #1934m
to #3536m and the latest estimate, according to the Central Statistical
Office, suggests that the trend in the whole world visible deficit is
widening.
The value of total exports in January was #11.8bn, up 1.5% on December
while total imports were #13bn, 2.5% less than in December. Over the
three months to January, exports increased by 1.5% and imports by 6%.
And the latest estimates of trends in the value of trade show little
change for exports and an increase for imports.
In volume terms, after stripping out oil (unchanged on the month at a
surplus of #400m) and erratic items such as ships, aircraft, precious
stones and silver, exports fell by 2% compared with December, and the
volume of imports fell by 3%. But over three months there was a fall in
exports of 0.5% while the volume of imports rose by 5.5%.
So the trend is rising imports growth and falling exports. Prices have
been rising for both month on month though this appears to be mirroring
the sterling exchange rate movement.
Looking at the value of commodity imports and exports, the former
appears to be running well in front of the latter in most categories. On
the three month basis to January, for example, imports of
semi-manufactures increased by 9.9% on the preceding three months
against a rise of 2.6% for exports.
Finished manufactures and total manufactures also saw the value of
imports rising more quickly than exports. In volume terms, imports were
also running well ahead.

WORLD No.1 Andre Agassi cruised into the quarter-finals of the Japan
Open in Tokyo yesterday, but admitted he was still troubled by a back
injury he suffered last month.
Agassi, who beat Canadian Sebastian Lareau 6-3, 7-5, injured his back
in the United States' Davis Cup world group quarter-final against Italy
and missed the reverse singles.
''It's just not better,'' he complained. ''I really think about it
because I want to go into the French Open rested and strong. I certainly
don't want to put myself through any risk.''
The US Open and Australian Open champion will face Australian
qualifier Scott Draper, who beat American Michael Joyce 6-1, 6-4.
The rest of the top four seeds all required three sets. Second-seeded
American Michael Chang recovered to beat Dane Kenneth Carlsen 6-7, 6-3,
6-4. South African Ferreira was a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 winner over American
Jeff Tarango, while American Jim Courier, the 1992 champion, had a
difficult time against hard-serving Canadian Greg Rusedski but
eventually won 4-6, 7-6, 6-4.
In the women's event, Japanese top seed Kimiko Date moved a step
closer to clinching the title for the fourth successive year by
trouncing fifth-seeded compatriot Kyoko Nagatsuka 6-2, 6-1.
Her semi-final opponent will be fellow Japanese Nana Miyagi, the
eighth seed, who beat Italy's Rita Grande 1-6, 6-4, 6-4.
* BILLY Knight has had to name four players outside the world's top
150 for his final match as Britain's Davis Cup captain.
The Euro-African Zone Group Two tie with the Slovak Republic in
Bratislava will feature Britain's weakest ever team in the competition.
They meet the Slovak Republic without their two highest-ranked
players. Jeremy Bates, 32, has officially retired from cup play after
having been an ever-present since 1985, and Mark Petchey currently is
playing too badly to be considered for selection.
Of the quartet, Southampton's Chris Wilkinson is ranked No.153,
Leatherhead's Danny Sapsford is No.226, Tim Henman, from Oxford, is
No.241, and South African-born Neil Broad is in the squad as a doubles
specialist.
After the tie, David Lloyd will take over from Knight.
* SCOTTISH No.4 Malcolm Watt, favourite for the men's singles title at
the Armour Motors Whitecraigs Easter tournament, opened with a 6-1, 6-2
victory over Stewart Clarke yesterday and will now meet Stirling
University bursar Tim Dalm. Results:
Men's singles. First round -- M Watt (Newlands) beat S Clarke
(Kilmarnock) 6-1, 6-2; T Dalm (Stirling University) beat A Ralston
(Broomhill) 6-1, 6-4; J Wood (Cults) beat C Giles (Edinburgh University)
6-0, 6-1; R Terras (Newlands) beat S Clarke (Burnside) 6-3, 6-3; I Boyd
(Newlands) beat G McAinsh (Giffnock) 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.
Men's Over-35 singles. Semi-final -- C Hanbidge (Giffnock) beat J Kerr
(Newlands) 6-2, 6-0; R Dunbar (Craighelen) beat S Walker (Broomhill)
6-2, 6-0.

AUSTRALIA'S hopes of winning the second Test against West Indies
disappeared in another rainstorm yesterday to provide a disappointing
end to a hard-fought match in St John's, Antigua.
A West Indies win also had been possible until rain drenched the
Recreation Ground early yesterday, preventing play until midway in the
second session, and leaving a draw the likely outcome.
Australian hopes rose fleetingly when Paul Reiffel bowled West Indian
captain Richie Richardson for two but opener Stuart Williams and Brian
Lara saw West Indies to safety.
When the match was called off as a draw, West Indies were 80 for two
in their second innings, still 176 runs behind after Australia declared
their second innings at 300 for seven.
There was little to separate the teams in a splendid Test and a draw
was perhaps a fitting result after 525 minutes were lost through rain.
Australia lead the four-match series 1-0. Scoreboard:

* MICHAEL Bevan introduced himself to English cricket with a century
for Yorkshire against Cambridge University at Fenner's yesterday.
The Australian was one of three Yorkshiremen to score hundreds as the
county gorged themselves on some friendly bowling, scoring 479 for three
in 96.3 overs before declaring.
Skipper Martyn Moxon scored the first first-class century of the
season, hitting fourteen 4s from 138 balls. He was followed by David
Byas -- one 6 and fifteen 4s in 147 balls -- but Bevan was the quickest,
reaching his ton in just 125 deliveries, including eleven 4s.
It was the first time for 20 years that three Yorkshire batsmen had
scored centuries in the same innings. Byas went on to a career-best 181,
hitting twenty-five 4s from 211 balls.
Durham vice-captain John Morris just missed a century at The Parks.
The former England batsman fell for 99 against Oxford University as
Durham rattled up 272 for four off 99 overs.
Mike Roseberry, leading Durham for the first time, also enjoyed
himself in the sunshine with 90. He struck three 6s and eleven
boundaries. Scores:
Yorkshire 479 for three, dec (D Byas 181, M D Moxon 130, M G Bevan 113
n.o., C White 50 n.o.); Cambridge University 12 for no wicket. At
Fenner's.
Durham 272 for four (J E Morris 99, M A Roseberry 90); v Oxford
University. At The Parks.

<HEADLINE>US retail sales rise in March</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>21</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978895055</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SALES at retail stores in the US edged upward in March after the
biggest drop in more than a year during February.
Total retail sales rose in March by 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted
$191.7 billion after a revised 1% fall in February that was previously
reported as a 0.4% decline.
February's drop in sales was the largest for any month since January
1994, when they also fell 1%.
The March report showed demand was fairly soft in several categories,
including new cars, as overall sales failed to meet Wall Street
economists' forecasts of a 0.4% increase.
During March, sales by new-car dealers were flat after falling 1.1% in
February. New cars account for about one-fifth of total retail sales, so
swings in demand strongly affect the overall monthly figures. Even
excluding cars, retail sales still rose only 0.2% after a 1% fall in
February.
Sales of all types of durable goods -- long-lasting items like cars
and furniture -- were up 0.4% in March after dropping 1.2% in February.
Non-durable goods such as food and paper products registered no rise
in sales at all last month following a 0.9% drop in February.
One area in which sales rebounded during March was building materials,
which gained 1.4% after a 0.3% decline in February. That may signal some
increase in building activity during the spring after months of weakness
in the housing industry.
Sales by general merchandise stores rose 0.5% after a 1.2% decrease in
February. At clothes stores, sales increased 1.5% after falling 1.1% in
February.
But sales at petrol service stations fell 0.2% last month following a
0.8% drop in February and drug store sales declined 0.4% after a 0.1%
February fall -- Reuter.

SHARES in Brown &amp; Tawse Group leapt 6p to 39p yesterday on news of a
possible ''substantial'' acquisition which could return it to the
dividend list in its current financial year.
The Basingstoke-based steel tubes distributor, which is registered in
Dundee, revealed it had signed Heads of Agreement with the bid target.
This document sets out the bare bones of the deal which might be
reached.
Brown &amp; Tawse would, under normal circumstances, release results for
the year just ended April 2 at the end of June.
However, finance director Ian Harding said, if the group was going
ahead with the acquisition, its results would be brought forward to
coincide with the purchase announcement.
The company said yesterday that a further statement would be made as
soon as was practicable. It expects to make a follow-up announcement
before the end of next month.
Brown &amp; Tawse, which supplies the UK construction and manufacturing
sectors, has undergone a radical shake-up in recent times, under the new
management team of chairman Don McFarlane and chief executive Richard
Wilson.
In the year to April 3 last year, it cut pre-tax losses from #36.5m to
#3.77m.
It has not paid a dividend since 1992, having maintained its total
payout in the year to end-March 1990 and reduced it in each of the
following two financial years.
However, the board of Brown &amp; Tawse believes the acquisition deal
being thrashed out would significantly enhance group prospects, allowing
the resumption of dividends in the current year to end-March 1996.
Ian Jermin, at Brown &amp; Tawse's London-based broker Credit Lyonnais
Laing, is predicting losses of #2.2m for the 12 months just ended and
had been expecting the group to return to profitability during the
current financial year.
Having turned Brown &amp; Tawse around during the last couple of years, it
is not surprising that management now wishes to add volume to the
restructured business.
Brown &amp; Tawse is being advised on the potential acquisition by Hill
Samuel Bank.

BP has dropped the granting of share options to 87 of its most senior
executives in favour of developing its existing ''phantom'' share
performance plan, chairman Lord Ashburton told the annual meeting.
Many companies have lately come in for criticism for lucrative share
options for executives.
The BP plan involves a notional amount of shares being awarded to
participants but they will only actually receive them if certain
long-term targets are met and then they must be retained for a further
period.
This was tried out in 1991 with a five-year target linked to BP's
performance relative to its peers. Under the current plan this will be
reduced to two years and the retention period has also been cut from
five to two years for 1994 and 1995 but three years therefter.
Phantom shares will be allocated in amounts proportionate to the
number of actual shares the executive already owns.
''In this way, a potentially significant reward is dependent upon a
significant personal financial commitment and can only be realised in
full once demanding targets are met -- which are by no means
automatic,'' Lord Ashburton proclaimed.
''Only if BP's shareholders receive returns in excess of those earned
by shareholders in our major competitor companies and only if executives
have made the necessary commitment of shares in the first place are
rewards then considerable,'' he added.
Share options will continue to be granted to 550 middle-managers,
exercisable so long as total return on BP shares exceeds the average
return on those UK companies in the FT-Actuaries World Index over three
years.
In his address, David Simon, chief executive, explained BP's main aims
as achieving $3000m earnings by the end of 1996, cutting debt to $8000m
within two years, and managing disciplined growth. He added that $1000m
out of planned capital spending this year was earmarked for new growth
activities.
The group continues to assume no help from a rising oil price, though
Mr Simon said there were grounds for arguing that last year's 8% decline
was unsustainable.

LAURA Ashley's senior management has still failed to get the business
on a sound footing despite board changes and provisions over the years.
Last year the company, famous worldwide for its women's clothing, made
a pre-tax profit before exceptional items of #3.8m, up just #800,000 on
the previous year. There is no dividend.
Demand was encouraging with sales increasing by 7.4% to #322.6m. Home
furnishings performed better than clothing with like-for-like sales
growth of 8% compared with just 2% for clothing.
Demand in the UK was stronger than on the Continent which continued to
suffer from varying degrees of recession. The US business continues to
underperform and 13 shops were closed during the year with further
closures to come.
In contrast there was a healthy profit contribution from licensing and
wholesale activities with worldwide retail sales of around #150m. The
group's manufacturing business continued to drive down costs and supply
products on a timely basis. About a quarter of garments were
manufactured inside the group as well as all the core furnishing and
wallpaper range.
The company has made an exceptional charge of #34m and is not
expecting any significant improvement much before two years when the
restructuring programme is complete. Chairman Hugh Blakeway Webb said
that once the restructuring was complete ''we are confident that
shareholders will realise enhanced value from the Laura Ashley brand''.
A third of the provision is to cover cutbacks in staff and buildings.
Around 200 jobs are to go in a programme that is expected to finish by
1996. Four head office buildings are to be consolidated into one head
office.
Despite the operational problems the balance sheet was strong with the
company holding #400,000 net cash by the year-end. Trading since the end
of January, in the current financial year, is said to be ''encouraging''
in the UK. Total sales in the nine-week period are 10% ahead of the
comparable period last year.
Home furnishings sales have been notably strong partly due to a
successful ''made-to-measure'' curtain promotion. Clothing sales
continue to be disappointing in both Continental Europe and North
America although Home Furnishings continue to perform well.
However, the results were at the bottom end of City expectations and
the shares dipped a penny to 68p.

Ross Finlay finds Nissan's little cutie
a real challenge.
CAR designers and sales staff are hardly very operatic in their
approach, but I would not be surprised if some Nissan people wander
around humming ''La Donna e Mobile.'' Women really are, sometimes, on
the fickle side. At least, while the Micra was designed partly to appeal
to women drivers, some find it a little too cute in appearance. A friend
of mine, who must have nerves wound like steel cables, has just bought
himself a Micra in the teeth of stylistic criticism from his wife.
There is no doubt, though, that the Micra is a commercial success. It
and the Primera recently boosted production at Nissan's Sunderland
factory to more than one million vehicles in the nine and a half years
since the plant started operating. Very substantial numbers are sold for
export. It is worth remembering that the Micra, although wearing a
Japanese marque badge, was voted European Car of the Year in 1993.
Micras come in variants from the standard one-litre three-door L
version at #6855 to the five-door SLX at #9830. I have been driving an
SLX with the #975 option of Nissan's own NCVT continuously variable
transmission system, and there are other extra-price features available
on it, such as power-assisted steering at #375, or a combination of PAS
and anti-lock brakes at #900. However, the entry-level Micra seems one
of the best buys in the range.
I find the Micra's ''retro'' styling very appealing. The benefits of
its high-set approach are quite obvious. It has excellent headroom all
round, even when fitted with a wind-back sunroof, and the tall
windscreen offers very good visibility. The little instrument pod is
neatly arranged, the switchgear is pleasant to look at and use, and
there is a large, handy tray from the centre to the left-hand edge of
the fascia.
Where the Micra's cuteness is misleading is in how the car goes on the
road. Especially with the 75bhp 1.3-litre engine, this is a real little
flyer, far livelier both in performance and in its sporty handling than
you might expect. It is a car for chucking around, with light and
accurate steering, very good handling balance and, as a bonus, a fine
standard of ride on roads of varying surfaces.
Of course, the NCVT system does dull the straight-line performance a
little, since it needs more power than a manual to run itself. But it
has the advantage that it offers infinitely variable ratios -- not just
the usual automatic's three or four -- within its upper and lower
limits. When you get it running at motorway speeds, with just a whiff of
throttle, you realise that its ultimate top ratio is a real overdrive.
Again, there is a certain penalty in fuel consumption. The NCVT version
will return about 54mpg at 56mph, 41 at 75 and 40mpg around town.
Persuading either the best economy or the sharpest acceleration out of
it demands a driving style attuned to the transmission's requirements.
When overtaking, the driver must allow for the fact that, once given
the gun, the NCVT model will instantly go onto a high-rev plateau of
engine speed, with the car accelerating to match the engine revs. The
lack of a rising engine note, when the evidence of the driver's ears
tries to contradict the evidence of his eyes, is quite difficult to cope
with at first.
And it is important, if you are going for economy, to ease off the
throttle and take advantage of that unusually high gearing. Unlike
conventional automatics, this one does not ''creep'' when in gear with
the engine idling. The familiar kick out of drive when the Micra is
coming to a halt is less pronounced than in any other CVT car I have
driven. A low-ratio hold provides some engine braking and allows for a
barnstorming approach to hills. Altogther, the Nissan system is the most
sophisticated of its type on the market.

<HEADLINE>Oil rally ended by Iraq sales worries.  Saddam expected to accept UN deal</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
OIL prices fell yesterday after worries of looming Iraqi oil sales
triggered the end of a month-long rally.
World benchmark Brent blend crude futures for June delivery were down
24 cents at $17.74 a barrel by late afternoon having hit $18.57 on
Wednesday.
Prices peaked for May delivery Brent at just under $19 a barrel on
Wednesday before the May contract expired, having put on $2.50 in a
month.
Oil prices were already looking like running out of steam by midday on
Wednesday but ''the catalyst to push prices lower was news concerning
the likelihood of Iraqi oil being sold for humanitarian reasons,''
according to analysts at Mees Pierson Derivatives.
''People are squaring their books before Easter,'' said one trader.
''No-one can be sure about what's going to happen on the UN-Iraq oil
talk front and the uncertainty worries the market.''
Iraq has been involved for years in negotiations about lifting or
easing sanctions on oil exports imposed in the wake of the 1990-91 Gulf
war.
Early this week, oil prices were boosted when any hopes for an early
end to sanctions were apparently dashed by a report on the possibility
of an Iraqi biological programme from Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish head of a
UN Special Commission.
But UN diplomats by Wednesday were saying that Iraq now looked ready
to accept a modified proposal for limited oil sales after rejecting it
just last month.
Under the proposal $2000m worth of Iraqi oil could be sold over six
months -- about 600,000 barrels per day -- with the proceeds used to buy
medicine and other humanitarian goods.
The deal increases the amount from a previous proposal to allow sales
worth $1600m and eases monitoring of the use of the proceeds. It would
be renewable after six months.
''I have always felt that there is a strong possibility, under
whatever formula, that Iraqi oil will be back on stream later this year
or early next,'' said Mehdi Varzi, an oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson
Securities.
''Once Iraqi crude comes back into the market, it is going to be very
hard to cut it off after six months. It could create a kind of fait
accompli, as long as Saddam Hussein satisfies the UN and doesn't shoot
himself in the foot,'' he added.
Iraq is still a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and had a production quota of 3.14 million barrels a day prior
to its invasion of Kuwait. Iraq Oil Minister Safa Hadi Jawad said
Baghdad is capable of exporting two million barrels of oil a day when
sanctions are lifted.

Kiev, Thursday
UKRAINE agreed today to close the ill-starred Chernobyl nuclear power
station by the year 2000 in exchange for Western agreement to help build
a gas-fired power station to replace it.
The head of Ukraine's Security Council, Vladimir Gorbulin, said
President Leonid Kuchma had fixed the date in talks with French
Environment Minister Michel Barnier, representing the European Union's
French presidency.
''At the meeting between the president and Barnier, an agreement was
reached to close Chernobyl by 2000,'' Gorbulin told journalists.
''Ukraine will enter the next century free of the consequences of the
tragedy of 1986,'' he added, referring to the fire and explosion in
Chernobyl's fourth reactor in April that year. Ukraine says the disaster
caused 8000 deaths.
Gorbulin provided no immediate details on the conditions reached to
persuade Ukraine to close the two reactors still functioning at the
station.
The plant provides 5% of the former Soviet republic's power, and
Ukraine had been resisting attempts to shut it down without providing
for an alternative.
Chernobyl's director, Sergei Parashin, had earlier told a news
conference that Ukraine was proposing to build a gas-fired station near
the stricken plant, adding that the West had to help meet the #2900m
bill.
He said Ukraine and 18 other countries could each provide about #133m
to help build the new plant, provide for its 5500 employees, and
compensate Ukraine for expensive gas imports.
Gorbulin said the outcome represented a retreat from a decision by the
G7 leading industrial countries in Naples last year, ''which made all
help conditional on a decision to close Chernobyl''.
''This is without any doubt a step forward,'' he said, adding that
documents for the closure plan would be submitted to the forthcoming G7
summit in the Canadian city of Halifax.
Parashin said it was up to Western countries pressing for the
facility's closure to come up with appropriate financing.
''Ukraine has no problem with Chernobyl, the problem is with the West
. . . The task of financing should be taken on by those people who have
expressed concern,'' he said.
''I believe this plan will be put into action. We are talking about
the word of self-respecting leaders of seven leading Western countries.
If they say Chernobyl is to be taken out of service, they must pay for
it. Otherwise they lose face.''--Reuter.

TIMBER and plywood importer JO Walker has braced shareholders for a
profits blow. The profits warning follows an announcement in February of
the effects of a financial review and reorganisation of operations.
''It has now become apparent to the directors that, due to a number of
internal accounting and cost estimation errors, the results of the
company for the year ended 31 December 1994, which will be announced in
mid-May 1995, are likely to be significantly below expectations.
''These results will also include certain provisions mainly arising
from the group reorganisation.''
It said sales for the first three months of 1995 are 8.5% higher than
for the same period last year, excess stocks are being reduced and
administration and overhead cost savings are being implemented.

JOHN Harvey's new play for Theatre Touring Tayside is a fascinating
mix of the bang up-to-date and the timeless. It tells the story of Beth
Donaldson (a sensitive, understanding performance by Katy Stephens), the
other woman in an MP's adulterous love triangle who, having been hounded
by the press, escapes to rural Scotland where she finds herself
stigmatised in much the same way as the ''witch'' who had lived and died
in the same remote cottage before her.
I tend to think that once you've seen one play about witches you've
seen them all -- and Arthur Miller made such a good job of The Crucible
that it's hard to see what any other playwright could add -- but Harvey
has other things to say, about intransigence, about the clash of
cultures, about our susceptibility to a tabloid vision of the world,
about the way we offer friendship only to those who conform to our own
standards, that make Inheritance an emotive, turbulent, and fresh piece
of theatre.
It is also brilliantly put together, directed by Harvey himself with a
big nod to Communicado in its theatrical mix of dance, song and music,
severe lighting, skeletal design and range of performance styles from
naturalism to expressionism.
Invigoratingly, the scene of greatest emotional power is a wordless,
stomping dance choreographed by Caroline Reagh and driven by Kitty
Watson's tremendous percussion, proving how well integrated the
disparate elements of the production are.
Perhaps in a play about open-mindedness, the locals could have been
portrayed with less of the shadowy, suspicious austerity of popular
myth, but the home crowd at Dundee Arts Centre roared their approval.
And a well-deserved roar it was too.

Guitarist Jeff Healey talks to
ROB ADAMS about the surprise choice in his band's latest album.
JEFF HEALEY says of the version of Stealers Wheel's Stuck in the
Middle which features on his band's new album, Cover to Cover: ''That
song seems to be surprising the hell out of a lot of people.''
Perhaps the surprise is more to do with the source than the song.
Stealers Wheel was the early 1970s outlet for Gerry Rafferty and Joe
Egan's highly successful soft rock material, whereas soft is not a word
you'd choose to describe Healey's output to date.
For Healey, though, it was a natural choice. ''It's a 12-bar blues as
far as the verse is concerned,'' he says, using the tone in his voice as
a reminder that this song form is not entirely alien to him. ''And I've
always liked the song. We didn't want to do it exactly as the original,
but then we didn't want to do any of the songs on the new album exactly
like the originals, so we kicked it around until we came up with a
version that everybody in the band liked.''
Aside from the track that's causing all the surprise, Cover to Cover
is a collection of songs -- or the type of songs -- that Healey grew up
playing. There's The Yardbirds' Shapes of Things, The Beatles' Yer
Blues, a couple of Jimi Hendrix songs (Angel and Freedom) and blues from
the pens of Robert Johnson, Willie Dixon, Albert King, and Lonnie
Johnson. Spirit's I Got A Line On You also makes an appearance, as does
Cream's Badge (''because it saves us doing Sunshine of Your Love'').
If, at 29, Healey seems a bit young to have grown up playing the music
of 1960s icons, it's worth remembering that he begged for his first
guitar at the age of three. Born with eye cancer, he had become blind at
a year old, a factor which he turned to his advantage. ''I was damn
lucky,'' he says. ''I learned from local players or records instead of
someone showing me what they did or me reading a diagram or chart.'' He
was, he says, forced to pick up the music with his own ears and recreate
it. ''Probably any player who's regarded as an innovator has learned
music that way.''
By the age of six his unique style of playing the guitar -- he holds
it on his lap, with his left hand fretting from above rather than around
the neck -- had become a familiar sight around Toronto. In his teens he
played in bands covering the entire musical spectrum before settling
into the hard-driving blues style that has become his trademark.
The Jeff Healey Band formed in 1985 and has retained the same nucleus
of Healey, bass guitarist Joe Rockman, and drummer Tom Stephen. Adopting
the terminology of a soccer coach, Healey talks about the need to
freshen up the team from time to time. ''We went out on our last tour
with a keyboard player and a couple of singers, which was a lot of
fun.''
For the tour which calls on Glasgow at Barrowland on Sunday they have
added an extra guitarist, Tom Rush. When Healey, whose speaking voice is
the perfect antithesis of the kind of frenzied storms his guitar playing
is capable of creating, describes Rush as ''probably the best slide
guitarist around'', he manages to make this sound like an
incontrovertible fact.
Of the decision to follow three big-selling albums with a return to
the trio's bar band roots, he says: ''It seemed a logical idea. We'd had
recognition in the past for doing covers like While My Guitar Gently
Weeps and Hideaway and what we'd been doing more recently was becoming
predictable. I wanted something different and fun, something reminiscent
of when we made very little money.''

Whacked out after a two-month slog working on their new album, One
Dove explain the basis of their unique sound to Thom Dibdin.
ETHEREAL. It's the only word that will do. Once heard, who can forget
the gorgeous sweep of One Dove's finest moment, Fallen? Vocals which
whisper, transparent, through dense textures of processed sound.
Heavenly chord progressions, layered over intricate rhythmic loops and
big fat bass lines.
One Dove could only exist in this pre-millennium decade. Conceived on
the dance floors of Glasgow's early nineties club scene, the band was
born in the privacy of the rehearsal studio and passed through puberty
in the recording studio. It was not until the first album was released
that One Dove appeared as a live entity, neatly circumnavigating the
traditional back-of-a-Transit touring route to fame.
Remixed, One Dove's records have spun in clubs across the country. Yet
unlike recent producer-led efforts such as Leftfield, One Dove is a
collective unit; a dance band who write real pop songs about real
emotions; an electronic dance band who were sampling guitars long before
the Prodigy made it trendy.
And here they are. The three doves: Dot, Jim and Ian, in their
back-lane rehearsal studio in the West End of Glasgow; whacked out after
a two-month slog recording their next album. Outside, trains rumble past
on the Underground, rolls of barbed wire stretch out behind a used-car
lot, glinting in the evening sun.
Inside the white-walled studio, technology winks from keyboards and
mixing desks as we listen to the results of the two months' hard work
being compiled on to hard disc: songs so fresh that some have yet to be
named; songs so dripping with emotion that the band cannot even bring
themselves to talk about them.
''Writing a song is like a personal exorcism,'' explains Ian, ''and
when you've just done it, it is hard to pinpoint what you've just done.
It is easier now to go back and look at the first album and say what
that was about. A lot of the time it is so personal that the very fact
you've written lyrics and put it down on record is enough. You don't
want to give anything more away.''
So we don't talk about the meaning behind the slow, burning rumble of
bass on Kill Time, which layers whip-crackaroo and wobbly space warp
guitars with the scratch of vinyl. Or the soundscape of unrequited,
late-night love that is Waltzbaby: a song which catches you in the back
of the throat, practically reducing you to tears.
''A lot of the beauty in what One Dove do lies in our ability to take
a chord progression in a unique direction with the sounds that we use,''
says Dot. ''For me the easy bit is writing the chord progression, melody
and lyrics. But where do you take it then?
''Some people have inspired production ideas or just an inspired,
unique use of sounds, but they don't have the chord progressions to put
under them. We take strong chord progressions, but we still have the
ability to remain totally experimental and surprising with the direction
that we take them. That's why we are unique as a band, because we do use
sounds that people say 'where the hell did that come from?', which is a
gift in itself.''
You are unlikely to hear these songs in their current raw state. So
passionate are One Dove about what they want from their music that they
have eschewed the conventional wisdom that a record must be recorded
with a producer on hand. The band have spent their recording time alone,
moulding the songs, crafting them into their own unique wall of sound.
The production will come later.
''What's the last thing that happens in a film?'' asks Jim, by way of
explanation. ''It's the editing. The editor takes two hours of raw film
and turns them into a zippy one-and-a-half-hour movie. That, basically,
is what we are looking for in a producer. Aural editing. I'm not talking
about cutting the length of the songs, but someone saying 'that sound is
redundant'.''
It's a brave step, not popular with record companies who demand the
instant fix of a commercial hit guaranteed by a ''name'' producer.
That's not to say that the dubbed-out bass and whispering snare drum on
the band's version of Kites -- a number nine hit for Simon Dupree and
the Big Sound in 1967 -- is not commercial. It's just that they sound
exciting and different to anything anyone else is turning out.
''Guitars are quite, quite limited,'' says Jim, and as one-time
guitarist with Altered Images, he should know. ''Everybody says machines
are soulless, but they are far more sophisticated than a lot of people
give them credit for; so sophisticated that they are a lot better at
turning people's emotions into music. Far too many Luddites keep hold of
guitars simply because they are scared to try and express themselves in
a different way.
''It's the experimentation with sound that I think guitar bands aren't
doing. These people have just seen a tried and tested path and said
'right, we'll go there'. We are walking on the edge of the cliff, but if
we fall, if we fail, at least we are going to fail with some respect for
ourselves.''
Whether more commercial success beckons or not, you can guarantee that
one word will dominate the reviews next autumn when One Dove's
collection of delicate, unearthly music is finally released into flight:
Ethereal.

IT is always foolish to carry out a post-mortem before the patient has
been pronounced dead, but reports of concern for the health of Glasgow's
Mayfest are not exaggerated. It was always thus. The festival came into
being as a three-week-long extension of the May Day holiday, perhaps
never explicitly socialist in its intent, but always linked to the
political hue of Glasgow's resident Labour administration. Mayfest has
come a long way since then, arguably further than socialism. While still
encompassing a vast amount of broadly populist art -- from the
accessible theatre pioneered by the city-based 7:84 and Wildcat theatre
companies, and continued by younger groups like Clyde Unity, to the
showcase platform for popular music that pre-dated Glasgow's stint as
the nation's Sound City last year -- from its earliest years it brought
to the city a selection of international work that made it a companion
to that other festival (and its fringe) in the east that had to be taken
seriously. There were so many tensions built into its intention,
however, that it has never really settled. The festival's board has
retained a political complexion that has ensured it has sometimes been
self-interested where it should have been supportive. Directors of very
different backgrounds and personal agendas have come and gone -- each
making their own stamp on the character of the festival and ultimately
confusing its essence.
Of late -- and probably since 1990 when Glasgow's year as city of
culture marginalised its importance -- it has been impossible to make
any sensible definition of the festival's purpose. It grew to be bigger
than anything except the Edinburgh Fringe, and found that size is not
everything. It attracted international productions and was criticised
for ignoring the grass roots. The board, presumably at a loss itself,
employed a firm of consultants to make recommendations. Those have, it
would appear, been largely ignored, while new director Paul Bassett took
a blank sheet of paper and started again, seeking to redefine the
relationship between the festival and the city's venues and producing
companies. The past, from the festival's files to its longest-serving
people, was purged, but the new set-up -- where personnel seemed without
clear responsibilities -- was haemorrhaging staff even as the
widely-criticised programme brochure was published.
There is a negative attitude abroad to Mayfest. With 1990 a fading
memory, the city's movers and shakers are looking towards the next
prize, City of Architecture and Design in 1999. That Mayfest was a
factor in Glasgow winning the 1990 title is unarguable, but the festival
is somehow seen as part of the city's past, finding its defenders among
those who hanker after a Glasgow of the shipyards and working-class
pride. Those who were actually involved in the festival over the years
tell a more affecting story. Without exception they speak of the
festival with great affection, worry over it like a favoured god-child,
and contend any attempt to diminish it. There is considerable evidence
that the public feel exactly the same. The glib accusation that for most
people in Glasgow Mayfest means only later drinking is belied by the
huge increase in audience. During this decade -- allegedly the period of
the festival's decline -- the audience has grown by 50%. Perhaps the
post-mortem should be postponed until the box office is counted.

QUIET solo guitar recitals in licensed premises, late-night at folk
festivals don't always achieve the desired atmosphere. But many a trip
to the bar (and to other wee rooms) was postponed, the only sound being
that of mouths falling open as Glasgow's Tony McManus went through a
repertoire of pipe tunes, fiddle tunes, reels, and slow airs.
McManus may put in a lot of detail, often using a piper's sense of
embellishment and even the drumming-on-strings quality of a hammered
dulcimer, but he never plays for mere effect. His touch is superb and
the dry humour of his introductions was matched by a self-mocking finale
where, having eased from Louis Armstrong's Wonderful World into
something more traditional, he then eased back again with brilliantly
ironic timing.
Brendan Power has taken his harmonica into myriad different musical
situations since arriving in London from New Zealand and his set with
jazz bassist Olly Blanchflower and Frank Kilkelly, a guitarist with both
the Irish and the swing tradition at his fingertips, reflected many of
them.
The Didgeri Blues gave an idea of where Power was coming from (and
heading for: the therapist's chair if he's not careful) and Chopped Up
Onion Blues, a lesson in how to get the blues when you don't have them
but want them, gave a further helping of humour. But he is a seriously
good player who can slip with ease from the heavily echoed, free-form
Space Out to Charlie McCoy's Appalachian-flavoured New River Gorge to a
gorgeously expressive My Laggan Love and on to his own very individual
and much-requested revamp of the Jolly Beggarman.

WANTED: five women anxious to lose weight and get into shape for the
summer. Stand clear! The call has gone out from a new Granada Television
health and lifestyle programme, to be screened on Monday evenings from
May 15, and hosted by This Morning presenters Judy Finnegan and Richard
Madeley. The five volunteers chosen will feature during the 8-week run
to show how they're shrinking and musn't be coy about declaring their
actual and target weights. Dieters aged between 30 and 40, with
children, should write to Get A Diet! PO Box 321, Manchester M60 3AA,
enclosing a photograph, telephone number, and a few lines about
themselves and diets they've already tried.
Bypass operation
* A NEW service from the Consumers' Association will work wonders for
the health of your wallet. Prohibitively expensive premium-rate calls on
medical matters -- costing up to 50p a minute -- can be bypassed using
the Which? Healthline. Starting May 1, it offers advice on more than 350
health topics and services from leading specialists. As well as major
illnesses, there's help with problems like snoring, nose bleeds, nappy
rash, glue-sniffing, and feeling angry with the kids. Calls on the
round-the-clock service are charged at local rates only and an A-Y
directory in this month's Which? Way To Health says how long each
pre-recorded message lasts (food allergy, for instance, 10 minutes). For
information about subscribing to Which? phone 0800 252 100.
Granddady of them all
* IF YOU fancy upstaging the neighbours, there's just time to acquire
one of the star items featured in the new Home Front series, starting on
BBC2 next Wednesday (8.30pm). The Amos Haniff grandfather clock struck a
chord with the show's producers, who fell in love with its hearts and
flowers design -- fresh flowers pop out of the dial -- and a cabinet in
the bottom enscribed ''drink to me only with thine eyes''. There's room
to accommodate a bottle of champagne and a couple of glasses, or similar
token of affection for your loved one. Time, as they say, is money and
the clock has a price-tag of around #1000. It's a striking feature of
the current display of contemporary design at the Haniff Studios, 46 St
Stephen Street, Stockbridge, Edinburgh (phone 0131 226 7057).
World of difference
AROUND the world in 8 days . . . or rather, evenings, is the tempting
offer from the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. Starting on Wednesday,
a Plants Of The World study course -- each tour lasting 90 minutes and
led by Dr Ian Darwin Edwards -- will focus on the botany, ecology, and
uses of plants from eight regions of the world. Fee: #35 for eight
weeks. For information on this and other special events call Sharon Kirk
on 0131 552 7171.
Feeding tempation
* WARNING for Easter holidaymakers from the SSPCA: the animal welfare
organisation says adverts for 48-hour pet feeders are encouraging owners
to break the law. Under the Abandonment of Animals Act, it's an offence
to leave an animal alone for more than 24 hours at a time, and the
society will prosecute owners who lock their cat in or throw the dog out
when they go on holiday. Pointing out that 48-hour feeders can cause
suffering if they fail, the SSPCA recommend pets that can't be taken on
holiday are boarded at a reputable kennel or cattery -- check them out
first -- or left in the care of a reliable friend.

MAHLER believed that ''the symphony should be like the world; it must
contain everything''. Last night the centre of Mahler's symphonic world
was to be found in the royal concert hall where the Royal SNO, under the
balletic baton of conductor laureate Neeme Jarvi, found all the
components the composer could have wished for in his Resurrection
symphony.
A performance of moments, it wasn't all mind-blowing Mahler but rather
a carefully chosen journey through a wealth of emotions from the first
fearful bite of the delirious opening strings to the choral cries of
relief in the spectacular finale. Although a perfectionist, Jarvi
doesn't mind a few cracks in the orchestral texture so what we got was a
gutsy, full-blooded account from an augmented Royal SNO.
Jarvi's beautifully paced tempos allowed the principal motifs to
emerge with breathtaking clarity, particularly the rays of sunshine
emanating from the trumpet section. Seductive strings sat alongside
sorrowful wind, contrasts in Mahlerian moods matched by graphic
contrasts in orchestral colour, and always at the core was Jarvi,
serving as a statuesque pillar of inspiration.
Mezzo-soprano Jean Rigby brought to the soul-searching Urlicht an
animated urgency, heightening the clarity of her wonderfully rich voice.
Utterly still for her final words, the moment was shattered by a
ferocious attack on the finale; a true moment of shocking symphonic
juxtaposition.
Soprano Clarry Bartha joined the Royal SNO Chorus for the haunting
promise of Resurrection -- solidly voiced and breathing total
conviction. As 11 horns and 10 trumpets blasted their souls to heaven,
we all knew we'd inhabited Mahler's symphonic world and it did contain
everything.

ON the debate on a good diet versus multi-vitamins, I would agree with
Dr Mike Lean that ''nothing should ever be a substitute for fruit and
vegetables'' (March 30). He also says that there is no proof that
vitamin tablets are very beneficial.
I would take issue with this. There are many groups who are at risk of
nutrient deficiencies (eg, pregnant women -- iron, folic acid) who are
given supplementation by the health service. This is based on scientific
research.
Dr Lean is certainly right in saying it is difficult to prove that
supplementation makes a difference to health. This is because
conventional clinical trials are designed to suit the testing of a
specific drug for a specific disease but do not suit the testing of
several nutrients with complex interactions for prevention of disease.
Many intervention trials have shown that fewer people suffer from
degenerative diseases when supplementation is given.
My main problem with Dr Lean is the conventional view that a good
healthy diet is all we need for nutrition -- ''What we need to do is
tell people how much (fruit and veg) they should be eating''. To me it's
a great theory but in practice it's not quite as easy as that.
Some people could not cope with fruit alongside a meal, causing
bloating and malabsorption, especially older people with sluggish
digestive systems. Some people will not eat fruit and veg. Some people
cannot buy fruit and veg.
He says that it may be too late suddenly to start taking vitamins
midway through life. Equally it can be very difficult to change bad
eating habits later on in life.
There is no easy solution. Dr Lean is doing a great job in making
human nutrition come alive at Glasgow University, a subject which has
been neglected in a city with possibly more nutritional problems than
any other.
The main long-term answer is to educate children before bad habits
start. An excellent article recently in The Herald showed that
Strathclyde region was improving choice in school meals and raising
awareness of nutrition. For the rest of us, a better diet makes sense
but for various reasons is sometimes difficult to achieve.
I feel that a good quality, readily absorbable supplement containing
anti-oxidants should be available on prescription.

MR J B FRANCEY says in his letter (April 10) that at least one Western
yard was able to compete for the building of the Oriana.
In the years 1995 to 1998 at least 20 cruise ships, each one larger
than the Oriana, are due to be delivered from yards in Finland, France,
Italy, and Germany.
The tragedy is that not a single one will be built in Britain.

Sarajevo, Thursday
THE United Nations today said its relations with the Bosnian Serbs
were at a low ebb after a tart exchange over the recent shelling of
Sarajevo.
The often frosty relationship between the world body and the
separatist Serbs has cooled again with the Serbs withdrawing
co-operation, blocking fuel convoys, closing Sarajevo airport, and
refusing to meet the UN commander, British Lieutenant-General Rupert
Smith.
''Certainly our relations with the Bosnian Serbs are at a very low
level,'' UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward said in Sarajevo.
The latest dispute followed a letter of protest to the Bosnian Serbs
from General Smith after Serb shells blasted Sarajevo on Sunday, killing
three people.
He reminded the Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic that he
could call on Nato warplanes to launch air strikes against Serb guns as
a way of protecting civilian ''safe areas''.
Mladic fired back a blistering response yesterday, denying
responsibility for the attack and accusing General Smith of using
''impermissibly tactless language''.
The UN said relations were so bad that the Serbs were refusing to
discuss giving the security guarantees needed to reopen Sarajevo
airport, closed since Serb gunners raked a US cargo plane on Saturday.
Nor will Mladic meet General Smith to discuss letting fuel through to
eastern Muslim enclaves, where peacekeepers have been reduced to using
pack animals.
The airport blockade prevented peace envoys from the five-nation
Contact Group from visiting Sarajevo yesterday to try to persuade the
reluctant Bosnian Government to extend a battered four-month truce due
to end on May 1.
The trip's cancellation was a further blow to hopes of restarting the
stalled peace process, already dented by Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic's refusal to recognise Bosnia, a step negotiators hoped might
pressure the Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace plan dividing the country.
Western diplomats fear a return to all-out war if both sides fail to
agree to extend the ceasefire.
Fighting hotted up today with shelling in the government-held city of
Tuzla and another artillery round hit a Sarajevo suburb. No serious
injuries were reported. Heavy fighting also broke out in the north-west
enclave of Bihac, where the Bosnian army launched a fierce attack
against rebel Muslim forces backed by Krajina Serb troops from Croatia.
In Croatia, the airport near the Adriatic town of Dubrovnik came under
artillery fire today and the area went on temporary red alert.
UN observers could not immediately say who launched the shells. Chris
Gunness, spokesman for the UN peacekeepers in Croatia, said observers
counted 10 to 12 explosions.--Reuter.

WHY do we ban tobacco advertising on television when manh of the drama
productions do a much more effective job for the tobacco industry than
any advertising agency could?
I have just watched the pilot play for a new series. About five of the
main characters smoked, including the male lead. This was totally
unnecessary for the storyline. We have highly skilled actors who do not
have to depend on cigarettes to portray anxiety.
There was one disgraceful scene in which the hero figure protectively
embraced his younger daughter with a fag in his mouth. What can a few
anti-smoking posters do against this powerful imagery which our children
so often see in film and television drama?
Several years ago there was an expose in the US of the tobacco
companies using backhanders to ensure that cigarettes were used in
films. At times one is driven to question whether the same does not on
occasion happen here.
It might be useful if the health education groups entered into
discussion with Equity as well as the film and television companies to
ensure that when a cigarette is lit up on the screen there has to be an
important dramatic reason for doing so.
Meanwhile, can the television authorities please clean up their act?

EDINBURGH International Folk Festival's first concert in the capital's
new theatre sold out a week in advance, which was great news for the
festival but bad news for its star turn who, they assured us, would have
preferred if nobody had turned up, doubtless so that they could add this
to their many unlikely sounding ''previous gig'' tales.
Bain and Cunningham's sell-out appeal is easily understood: great
tunes, from Cunningham's own lovely slow airs to the ripping Auld
Fiddler (complete with the inevitable furtive gestures as to said
fiddler's identity), played with great style. Eventually. Because the
story behind the tune made the tune almost incidental so often that they
were in danger of turning into Morecambe &amp; Wise in front of our eyes.
Later, during the first encore, they were in danger of turning into a
pair of fiddle and accordion-playing Les Dawsons in front of our ears.
The second encore reintroduced the talents of Irish-American fiddler
Eileen Ivers and her band, whose opening set was full of sparkling
fiddle playing and well-thought-out groups of tunes such as the
''marathon'' which moved effortlessly through moody airs and tricky
dance tunes, culminating in what sounded not unlike a wah-wahed variant
on the Hen's March to the Midden.
Guitarist John Doyle provided Ivers with perfectly judged
accompaniment, both in his gently coaxing finger-picking style and his
clean but pushier rhythm playing. So too did Tommy Hayes, who between
reminding us of the genuinely musical properties of jew's-harp, bones
and spoons, poured scorn on the definition of an optimist as a bodhran
player with a pager.

REMEMBER the good old days when the National Health Service was
populated by doctors and nurses and administrative workers toiled in the
background.
No longer. A piece of paper from Forth Valley Health Board has crossed
the Diary's desk. It is a letter to general practitioners signed by C C
Denton, the board's Business Manager, Acute Purchasing Team. Now the
aforementioned title is good enough to be getting on with but we were
even more impressed by a reference in the letter to the health board's
''Safe Haven Manager''.
We had imagined that the health board had gone all nautical or perhaps
had suddenly realised that caring was more important than cash.
But no, it's just another example of modern NHS-speak.
The letter was about the Forth Valley Health Board sub-contracting
orthopaedic work to the HCI hospital in Clydebank. If any GPs had
queries, they were asked to contact, in the first instance, the Safe
Haven Manager. The safe haven himself, for we have indeed spoken to him,
explained that his role was to set someone specifically in place to deal
with the flow of administrative detail -- or something like that.
We are sure it is a vital function but cannot quite picture the scene
where there is a medical emergency and we are relieved to hear the magic
words: ''Let me through! I'm a Safe Haven Manager!''
Carrickulum vitae
UNTIL we read the above extract from the TV listings of the Sunday
Times we had never heard of a Scottish politician called Carrick
Cumnock. But we are sure he exists and is probably a Conservative or,
more likely in local government these days, an Independent.
Carrick Cumnock is in a long tradition of Ayrshire politicians of a
Tory bent with surnames as first names. Is that not right, Struan?
The Diary would like to know more about Carrick Cumnock and may even
offer valuable prizes of strong drink for information about his career
to date.
* Footnote for readers who are not into sublety -- make up some funny
bits about a fictional but typical Conservative called Carrick Cumnock,
send it into the Diary at the usual address, and you might win yourself
a bottle of whisky.
Exit, posthaste
IT takes some stories longer than others to come to the attention of
the Diary. To celebrate the arrival of the good weather, we will regale
you with a tale about a Christmas party at the Hilton Hotel in Glasgow.
We suspect the late arrival of this particular story may be due to the
fact that it concerns operatives of the Royal Mail. A squad of posties
had arranged to hold their Christmas festivities at the Hilton. They
duly turned up and sat down at the table which they had booked among a
whole function room of party-goers.
We are not being snobbish here when we report that the posties stood
out a bit from the others who had booked their night of festive fun at
the Hilton. Yes, some of them were still wearing their postman's
jaikets. But more noticeable was the fact that a large carry-out of
bottles of Buckfast tonic wine was arrayed on the table.
The five-star Hilton does not feature Buckie on its wine list so the
maitre d'hotel was able to ascertain that this illegal cairry-oot had
been cairried in. The situation was resolved when the posties received a
refund and left to celebrate at a venue where one can presumably quaff
one's own supplies of the Monklands jungle juice.
Getting to the
bottom of harris
WE mentioned yesterday the Super Shaper briefs, a variety of
underpants which come with discreet rear padding which apparently makes
the male form more attractive to the female of the species. The article
from which we had plagiarised this information said the knickers offered
''an eye-popping cleavage which leaves even the saggiest wearer with a
dream harris''.
We were puzzled as to what harris had to do with it. Paul Young, the
actor and angler, was on to explain. Harris is cockney rhyming slang for
what us Scots might call your bahookey.
''I shared a flat in London some years ago with Dennis Waterman and he
explained the harris to me. It is cockney rhyming slang twice removed.''
Briefly, bottle and glass means ass (said, of course with the
intrusive R). Bottle, in turn, becomes Aristotle. And Aristotle then
becomes Aris. Put a typical Cockney H in front of it and we end up with
harris.
Nothing at all to with the Utter Hebridean island.
Right muck up
GREAT Corrections of Our Time. Ettrick and Lauderdale District Council
has received a wee note from Historic Scotland in which the government
body charged with looking after our architectural heritage admits to a
slight misprint in its list of listed buildings in the council's area.
It writes: ''It has been brought to our notice that the latest amendment
to Ettrick and Lauderdale district has an error. The schedule states
'Smithy and Pall House, Midden Village' when it should, in fact, read
'Smithy and Pall House, Midlem Village'.'' But not the first historic
building to look like a bit of a pigsty.
A real asset
THE Western Isles Council, the people who managed to lose #23m with
the BCCI bank, has appointed a new depute director of finance. A Mr
David O'Loan.
* WE accord a bit of gratuitous publicity to Westbourne Cars, a taxi
firm which operates in the South Side of Glasgow, mainly because we are
quite taken with the gratuitous violence portrayed on the the company's
calling card. Definitely a case of safer inside a Westbourne car than
under one.

SIMON FRASER, director of the Scottish Landowners' Federation,
presumably objects to my argument for land value taxation but makes no
attempt to refute it (April 4).
Instead, he delivers a eulogy in defence of the existing pattern of
landownership, concluding with the outrageous statement that
''landowners will provide the land''. What does he think came first --
the land or the laird?
He paints a picture of industrious and benevolent landowners striving
for the welfare of the land and its occupants. It is unlikely that the
majority of upland communities would see this as an accurate portrayal.
In particular, those that have fought to acquire the land for
themselves would no doubt be perplexed by Mr Fraser's assertion that the
best system is the one from which they have gone to such lengths to
escape.
Scotland's uplands have been described by conservationists in such
terms as ''man-made desert'' and ''ecological slum''. But when fellow
landowners, such as Sir John Lister-Kaye in his paper, ''Ill fares the
land'', are also prepared to publish comprehensive denunciations of
current land-use practices, Mr Fraser must surely sit up and take note.
The best safeguard for the land is for it to be in the hands of those
whose future depends on its well-being. Land value taxation provides the
most suitable basis for this as it would wipe out the speculative value
of the land and knock the relish off the ownership of land as a novelty.
It would involve no nationalisation and no compulsory purchase or
dispossession, and the efficient, hard-working landowner with the best
interests of the community at heart, as depicted by Mr Fraser, would
have nothing to fear.
Indeed he would surely welcome it as a huge source of alternative
rather than additional public revenue which would enable the Government
to reduce taxes on the labour and capital markets.

WHEN the British Broadcasting Corporation did everything wrong the
other week it did everything wrong. Not one single person, including a
Tory MP, didn't realise that the faux pas of not realising that Scotland
was having the farrago of local elections in the same week as Panorama
wanted to portray John Major as a Prime Minister, was not actually
legal. The trouble was that the Beeb didn't know Scotland was a nation,
or if it did, it didn't count.
So we all enjoyed the discomfiture of the chaps. Must have been
dreadful for the BBC chaps in the Garrick, especially the Scottish
members. But did they not compound the offence but this week? They did.
Last Sunday a programme called Media Lines went out, just after The
Archers it is. Let us talk of The Archers because it is quintessentially
English. Everybody in it is an absolute turd, apart from maybe Marjorie
Antrobus. No, she is a bit of a piece of excrement too. The Archers is
packed full of mendacity and greed -- the other month David Archer shot
a badger, for heaven's sake, because he thought his sheep were getting
infected. If I were a sheep I would rather be infected by a badger than
a turd like David Archer.
Anyway, last Sunday, just after The Archers, they had this prog called
Media Lines and it is all about the media and they had a major item on
it about how no national newspaper had one single black columnist so I
telephoned the BBC in London and it didn't have anybody on except
somebody called a ''duty officer'', whom I imagined sporting a tunic and
a peaked cap a bit like a commissionaire in Harrods, and he answered me
and said he'd report my comments which were a bit acerbic.
For was it not the week before that the BBC had forgotten entirely
about Scotland. And here is the Radio 4 forgetting about Scotland being
a nation as well. I pointed out to this chap in the peaked bunnet that
The Herald is a national newspaper, and Scotland is a nation. That the
Beeb wouldn't dream of forgetting that the Irish Times or the Irish
Independent were Irish blatts from, well, Ireland, a nation once again,
is undeniable. That the Beeb frequently says we are all English when
some of us most certainly are not. The week after the debacle over the
BBC forgetting entirely about Scotland at all did it not have two more
grievous errors.
The first was on Media Lines, saying there were no black columnists in
the national press. Well, The Herald is a national newspaper and The
Herald has two black columnists. To the credit of one of our senior
editorial punters he didn't realise that Anwar Khan and Nicola Reeves
are what, I suppose, a London newspaper would call black, or of
African/Asian background.
His credit is that he didn't much care if they were black or not: he
thought they were good writers. Anyway Anvar Khan, who won a Press
Awards thing a few weeks back, was mistaken by the English press for a
Jewish male -- they called her Enver Cohen, the dolts. But Enver, sorry
Anvar, is in fact of Asian origin, and Nicola is of African origin, or
at least her parents are. As Sir Thomas Beecham, the conductor, once
pointed out on a tour of the Southern States when he was wanting a wee
half in a coloured bar and was told he couldnae get one because he was
not coloured: ''I am Sir, I am definitely coloured. I'm pink. Now get
that effing large whisky and soda.'' But why didn't the BBC know that
The Herald had two black columnists? Why didn't it think that Scotland
was a nation, a week after the Panorama nonsense when one might have
thought it would think. Why did it think black and white mattered
outside of paper and ink?
And then on Monday night was I not listening to the World Service and
did it not have an item about the demonstrations in Pollok Park in
Glasgow and did it not destroy itself over again. It was a young lady
with an English accent who told us, erroneously, that Pollok Park is the
largest open space in Glasgow (it isn't, not by a long chalk) and that
the demonstrators were all middle class (they aren't), and that Glasgow
is against the new roadway (the citizens are largely, rightly or
wrongly, in favour of it), and that Glasgow is riven in two by the
question. She tied it to other issues but sold the pass by saying that
other regions of Britain were . . . How d'ye like being a region?
On both occasions I rang up the BBC, perhaps because I am a bit
eccentric and also because I am a Scot and belong to a nation. I counsel
you to be as eccentric as I am myself. But am I eccentric? I think not.
It is the English BBC which is. The map hasn't been red for over 40
years, and Scotland has been, at least politically, for longer. Within
one week of the BBC having an even redder face than any flag, it managed
to do it again twice over. To ignore my country, a small one admittedly,
but not so small it should be so unconsidered. The colour I am now is
white. With anger.

Cosmetic companies whose adverts leave an impression that their
products might halt the ageing process leave themselves open to legal
challenge. Anvar Khan exfoliates the facts
THE demand for beauty products increases as self-esteem deflates. It
is an unfair equation. As long as unnattainable ideals of beauty are
promoted in fashion and beauty rags, the market for cosmetics will grow.
Britain spends almost #200m a year on anti-ageing moisturising creams.
Manufacturers who claim that their product will slow down the ageing
process are making a scientific not cosmetic claim. If the creams really
worked, if they stopped mature people from looking old, they would be
taken off the shelves.
''If products claim to have a medicinal value, they could be
restricted and only sold under licence,'' says John Simmons, product
lead safety officer for Kent.
In the late eighties, the cosmetics industry was challenged by the
Department of Trade and Industry. They were disturbed by claims that
some creams revitalised skin by accelerating cell growth. They said at
the time: ''If this was, in fact, the case, then we were concerned about
what it could mean for someone who has cancer.''
Cosmetic products which claim to delay the signs of ageing are
marketing themselves as pharmaceutical goods. This is, in fact, illegal.
In response, the Advertising Standards Authority recently implemented a
set of principles designed to curb excessive claims made by anti-ageing
products. The ASA judge each advert individually. Rule no 50.25 states:
''Some cosmetics have an effect on the kind of skin changes which are
caused by environmental factors. Advertisements for them can therefore
refer to temporarily preventing, delaying or masking premature ageing''.
Note, advertising the minor alleviation of ''premature'' ageing is
permitted, not the promotion of the idea that the natural ageing process
can be reversed.
Interestingly, Rule no 50.9 says: ''Advertisers should not use
unfamiliar scientific words for common conditions.'' A crash course in
cosmetic jargon is in order then, for probably 95% of the British
public. Pseudo-scientific terms are in common usage in the promotion of
anti-ageing products. What is a liposome? What is panthenol? What are
AHA's? What do they do? (See table.)
In 1992, in the States, the US food and drug administration demanded
that creams which claimed to have a remedial or therapeutic effect on
the skin should be called drugs and prove scientifically what they were
doing. The knock-on effect in the UK is that companies do not make
strong or definite claims. Successful cosmetic advertising, however,
implies, it does not state.
''Anti-ageing products are so vague, they never make any absolute
claims,'' agrees Martin Williams, a specialist in consumer safety.
''It all depends on gauging how the general public read an advert,''
explains a spokesman for the ASA. ''If they think that the product will
reverse the signs of ageing, that's not on.''
The beauty industry exploits the fact that you cannot legislate for
the suggestibility of consumers. ''It was the same with slimming
products,'' Martin Williams recounts. ''You cannot absolutely
substantiate ideas put into readers minds.''
All brands, from Elizabeth Arden and L'Oreal to Boots and Nivea are
punting products which allegedly have an ''anti-ageing action''. The
most expensive, a cream from Japanese cosmetic manufacturers, Kanebo,
costs #250 for a modest jar; others from #50 or #60. If consumers did
not believe that such creams would work, why would they pay such
enormous prices? Where would the justification for the expense lie?
There are no pioneering ingredients. The acids from oranges, grapes
and passion fruit plus sugar and milk, for example, have been used for
many years by dermatologists to treat skin conditions including acne. In
these circumstances they were always used in high concentrations because
of their effective exfoliating and moisturising properties.
Elizabeth Arden's Ceramide Time Complex Moisture Cream was one of the
first on the shelves, and put most dermatologists on guard simply by the
technology suggested in the name, and by the fact that the amount of
active ingredient is much lower than their therapeutic tests would
suggest would be seriously effective.
The inefficacy of an anti-ageing product is the sole reason it can be
advertised as an antidote to looking old. Cosmetic companies are able to
punt a cosmetic as a drug because the ingredients allegedly attack
everyday poisons which permeate the skin. They do not delay the
physiological process of ageing.
What science is sure of, however, is that smoking and drinking deprive
the skin of the Vitamin C it needs to renew. The sun's utra-violet rays,
too, are responsible for 80-90% of the visible signs of ageing. The
other enemy is environmental pollution. The message suddenly becomes
clearer. If you want to stay young looking for as long as possible, vote
Green.

MYSTERIES OF THE ORGANISM
* Fruit Acids: naturally occuring acids which are found in milk,
apples, grapefruit, lemons and sugar which improve skin discolouration.
* Cell Extracts: From either plants or animals which allegedly
encourages new cells to form.
* Cerebrosides and Ceramides: The fatty components of skin cells which
are recreated arificially to plump up skin and so reduce wrinkles.
* Liposomes: Microscopic bubbles which break up the skin and carry
ingredients into the skin. The break into the skin's top layer and deep
into the epidermis where they break down and disperse their contents.
* Nanospheres and Novaspheres: Mork and Mindy sounding versions of
liposomes and have a delaying effect on the release of their
ingredients.
* AHA's: A range of fruit acids which have a light peeling effect on
the skin. They airbrush out fine lines by speeding up the skin's
exfoliation rate. No two AHA creams are the same. They can irritate
sensitive skin and cause dry patches.
* Pro-vitamin B5: Also known as panthenol is a moisturiser which
reduces itching of the skin and is even thought to heal superficial
wounds.
* UVA and UVB filters: Cream with protective filters against the sun's
rays of Ultra-Violet light.
* Free Radical Scavengers: Free radical damage is thought to be a
primary cause of skin deterioration. On the skin, free radicals can be
generated by sunlight and environmental pollution, including, according
to Estee lauder, cigarette smoke. The scavengers include vitamins E and
C, and can reduce the formation of free radicals on or in the skin, and
are a key-ingredient in day-care and sun protection products.

WHAT on earth is happening to the outdoor access issue in Scotland
nowadays when Peter Evans in his article on the Scottish Rights of Way
Society anniversary (April 8) can describe the de facto and responsible
freedom-to-roam we have enjoyed all our lives as ''extreme''?
It is so normal that for years it did not merit any public discussion
and corridor rights-of-way became absorbed into the wider, moral-right,
general-access picture which has ancient roots.
Peter Evans makes no mention of the society's proposal that a line be
drawn up and down ''a popular mountain'' and that that be our legal
right-of-way. Such selectivity does little to help the debate.
We are all going to have to be vigilant on the access issue or we will
lose a precious inheritance. Defending responsible freedom-to-roam is,
of course, perfectly normal. It should not be necessary.

I READ Sarah Nelson's essay with interest as she seemed to be trying
to find a common middle ground (April 8). Then I re-read it and saw that
it was in fact no more than a pro-choice piece cleverly disguised by the
apparent attack on the feminist extremist point of view.
The first inaccuracy is in the opening sentence -- ''the spate of
killings by pro-life extremists'' -- is in fact two people who had no
connection with pro-life groups and one of whom was suffering from
mental illness.
The next sentence refers to the Pope's rigid inflexibility on the
abortion issue. How can he appear to be anything else when he and the
Catholic Church believe that abortion is forbidden by God? The liberal
Catholics to whom she refers are by their comments and beliefs no longer
Catholic but Protest-ant (yes, that's where the word comes from).
But the great weakness in her ''middle ground'' argument is that there
is no middle ground. Either one believes that abortion is permissible or
that it is not. No doubt David Steel believed that his Bill would do
away with backstreet abortions and only be used in limited cases of
special need (Sarah Nelson's middle-ground position), but the reality
has proved otherwise as four and a quarter million dead babies testify.
It is interesting to compare this quotation from Cardinal Winning
writing on the new Encyclical (The Gospel of Life): ''What could be more
compassionate than siding with the most dependent among us -- the unborn
at risk of death and the sick and frail whose condition increasingly
tempts us to see killing as a solution?'' with Sarah Nelson's ''that it
(abortion) is about taking life, that sometimes may be necessary or
justified, and that debates on this should be moved into the mainstream
of debate on similar difficult issues -- euthanasia . . . ''

AFTER all but burying her readers in a slurry of the stuff, Militant
Feminist variety, Sarah Nelson urges us to ''cut the crap'' (April 8).
Nowhere in the entire article can you find one word putting men in a
fair, loving, caring, or even human light. The utter lack of equipoise
puts the article in its true perspective. But I digress.
So, in the interest of the succinctity she so earnestly seeks, let us,
by all means get down to business.
Abortion is wrong per se, true or false? If true, then nothing can
justify it for it is never permissible to do wrong even if ''good'' may
come of it.
If false, then abortion on demand, for whatever reason, is a perfectly
viable option. It is on the positive side of this premise that we,
presumably the ''illiberals'', erect our metaphorical barricade. For no
egg, not even the curate's, can be good in parts.
Finally, after 800 years of mayhem in Ireland because of attempted
political assimilation, she now urges their moral one -- because ''we
(feminists?) have support to offer them also''.
Strongbow, if memory serves, crossed the water in 1170 under similar
pretext.

ON return from a recent skiing trip to Switzerland, I was saddened,
once again, to read of tragedies on the Scottish mountains during the
winter. Fortunately, some of the stories had a happy ending, none more
so than Andy Wilson's remarkable survival of nearly three days and
nights of what were no doubt extremely severe conditions.
Having skied, climbed, and walked in the Scottish mountains for many
years I can understand why people want to venture out in conditions that
some would regard as intolerable. People must be allowed to venture into
the mountains for sport and enjoyment even in conditions that most would
regard as an unbearably extreme environment.
When people engage in sports that are regarded as hazardous, accidents
can happen. This can occur due to the rapidly changing weather
conditions that are common in the Scottish mountains. The carrying of
the correct equipment and knowledge in its use as well as respect for
the mountainous environment that one ventures into, is most essential.
During many winter holidays in Switzerland and France I have skied off
piste and carried out tours such as the Haute Route. At all times I
carry a transceiver which transmits a signal on the internationally
accepted emergency frequency of 457 KHz.
These units have a transmission range of approximately 60-100 metres
for up to about 250 hours on new batteries and can be switched to
receive mode in the event of an accident in order to search for a
missing person.
Should an accident occur such as an avalanche, where someone is
trapped, others in the same party switch their units to ''receive'' thus
enabling the casualty to be found, via the grid search pattern.
From what I gather, in the Alps, a qualified mountain guide would not
take a party out ski touring without such units being carried by all
members of the group.
I gather that this type of equipment is used by some Scottish Mountain
Rescue Teams as protection for themselves during rescues in case of say
a secondary avalanche. If, however, the teams used a system on a
different frequency, for their own protection, this would leave the 457
KHz frequency available for use in searching for casualties and lost
persons.
May I ask the Scottish Mountain Rescue teams to consider introducing
this system as part of their search and rescue equipment? If such a
system was universally introduced in Scotland, any person choosing to
carry a transceiver and who became involved in an accident, would
probably be located more rapidly, thus, hopefully, saving life and the
voluntary rescue teams' time.

TODAY the Japanese Government is due to announce a package of measures
to cope with the steep rise in value of the yen against the US dollar.
In less than four months the Japanese currency has soared on the world's
foreign exchanges by nearly 20% against its American counterpart. The
yen's last dollar rate has been testing a new floor of 80.
Yet again, fundamental questions are being aired about what it all
means when currencies realign in such drastic fashion and what, if
anything, governments can and should do to intervene in the markets
which dictate these shifts.
The impact has had its knock-on effect on the pound. When I first came
to Japan, just over four years ago, I was getting 240 yen for my pound.
Now I'm lucky to get 130. That near halving of the rate makes an already
expensive city, viewed through Scottish eyes, almost cripplingly costly.
You can still travel almost anywhere in central Tokyo by subway for
140 yen, little more than #1. But just to step into a taxi costs a fiver
these days.
I spotted a #25 melon in a supermarket the other day, the kind that
costs 99p in Safeway. A beer is #6. Kobe beef costs around #30 for just
100gms. A modest hotel meal is now #60 a head. There's a beautiful
orchid plant in the flower shop downstairs. Price: #270.
That didn't stop fans sending dozens of these plants to their
favourite actors at the Kabuki Theatre the other night when two rising
stars earned prized new theatrical names. And that was after these same
fans had spent up to #120 for a ticket.
If you are Japanese, there's never been a better time to travel
overseas, and that, with golden week coming up soon, is precisely what
they are doing in very large numbers. And the Japanese taste for
expensive imported clothes and other luxuries can be satisfied at lower
yen prices.
But having a bull currency isn't all upside. For a country which has
built its post-war industrial strength on exporting manufactured goods,
the strong yen is very bad news indeed. Major industrial corporations
are still in the recovery phase from when the bubble economy burst and
real growth plunged from 5.3% in 1990 to minus 0.2% in 1993.
The Government was forecasting real growth of 2.8% in the coming year,
but official forecasting models suggest every 10% yen rise against the
dollar knocks more than half a per cent off GDP in year one and more
than twice that in years two and three. With a near 20% rise in the yen
so far this year, if this extreme volatility continues, sustaining any
real growth in the next few years will be an extremely difficult task.
That is the backdrop to today's promised package to help stem the
yen's rise. Apart from any action on domestic Japanese interest rates
(which are already so low there is limited room for manoeuvre), there is
talk of supplementary budget measures to stimulate domestic demand,
boost imports into Japan, and so cut the country's vast trade surplus,
now running at $130bn a year.
For hard-hit Japanese exporters, the way the rising yen is squeezing
their profits may encourage them to ship more of their manufacturing
capacity overseas. That's what happened in the 1980s when the yen last
gyrated upwards in the dizzying way we've seen it do recently.
Between 1984 and 1986 the yen doubled in value against the dollar. And
between 1986 and 1990 foreign direct investment by Japanese companies,
as a percentage of GDP, rose from around 3% to around 7%. But the really
dramatic rise in that overseas investment only started in 1988, four
years after the yen had started its climb.
The Japanese don't rush at such serious decisions. So any prospect of
a flood of mini-NEC-style Japanese investments into Scotland (NEC, the
world's second biggest chip makers' #500m investment in a second wafer
fab was the highlight of Locate in Scotland's year last year) could take
a little longer.
But timing isn't the only issue. Japanese manufacturers thinking of
investing more overseas have plenty of locations from which to choose.
And Europe may not be very high up their list at present. Hajime Sasaki,
an executive vice-president at NEC, told me yesterday that his company
sees the rest of Asia as the area of biggest growth in the next few
years, followed by the United States. So Scotland and the rest of Europe
may have their work cut out to grab a serious piece of any new action
arising from the yen's strength.
Tokyo is awash with talk of concerted action by the G7 nations to
stabilise currency movements. But that aspiration is not clearly matched
by any well-thought-out ideas as to what such action could be.
Almost everyone I've spoken to has pointed out that the problem isn't
so much the strength of the yen as the weakness of the dollar. The point
was put most forcefully by Koji Omi, a Liberal Democratic member of the
House of Representatives and chairman of its finance committee.
''The dollar has entered a crisis phase because the United States has
lost its enthusiasm for keeping the value of the dollar as a key
currency,'' he told me. Omi backs a strong domestic expansion programme
and efforts to cut Japan's huge trade surplus. He also talks about
agreeing international action to regulate speculators in areas like
derivatives. But he and many others argue much more needs to be done in
Washington to cut both the US budget and trade deficits.
''We have to tackle these structural issues in key currency countries.
Otherwise the turmoil will not stabilise,'' one senior official told me.
It is striking in all this debate how seldom the pound is mentioned at
all. Twenty-five per cent down against the German mark since we left the
ERM, dragged down against the yen on the dollar's coat tails, over the
longer view the pound seems only to be going one way.
''Name one other major currency against which we've risen in value in
recent years,'' a visiting English businessman challenged me over
dinner. We couldn't think of one. That must say something about our
much-vaunted economic miracle.

IT might be reasonable to expect that an official of the Union of
Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers would have some knowledge of major
developments in the field in which his members gain their livelihood but
judging from your article, ''All to keep 'em strolling in the aisles'',
one would be disappointed (April 7).
Mr John Glass is quoted in the following terms: ''When I started in
this business there were 25 Fraser stores in Scotland. Now there are
five and it's well-known their owners are only interested in Harrods.''
One thing that is well-known, at least to everyone except Mr Glass, is
that House of Fraser stores and Harrods Ltd became separate companies in
April, 1994, when the stores group was floated on the London Stock
Exchange as an independent plc.
The managements of both companies remain on excellent terms but I
should be surprised to learn that House of Fraser was only interested in
Harrods, particularly as HoF has so many excellent stores of its own in
London, not to mention the gem of Frasers in Glasgow itself.

ANDREW MEEHAN's Las Vegas (Hell on earth, Weekender, April 8) is
obviously the one I visited last year, but not one I recognise.
I took my sons there on the last stop of a world trip that had started
at Singapore, taken in Cairns, Surfer's Paradise, Sydney, Waikiki, and
Los Angeles.
It was the holiday of a lifetime, but if I was pressed to nominate my
favourite fun spot along the way it would have to be Vegas.
I stayed in the Luxor which, according to The Herald's traveller, is a
disaster in the desert, an insignificant waste with faulty plumbing and
inoperable lifts. I experienced no such problems. The hotel is over the
top in every way, certainly, but I expected nothing less of the
black-glassed pyramid.
Eating there was a pleasure and an experience and a meal for three
cost considerably less than you might pay for one in Glasgow.
All drinks in the gaming hall were free, dispensed liberally and with
a smile. Laughter is what I remember most of my stay there; that, and
the pleasure of promenading along busy late-night streets that held not
a hint of menace.
Andrew Meehan did get one thing right about Vegas. Most people do walk
there, but not, as he maintained, because it makes them feel virtuous.
With taxis and buses on the Strip moving at a snail's pace day and
night, Shanks's Pony is the only way to travel.

I TOOK some visitors to the Burrell Gallery in Glasgow to enjoy the
current exhibition of textiles and embroidery. It was a most enjoyable
afternoon, but I was badly let down by the lack of any postcards or a
well-photographed plain Easter card or just a blank greetings card.
Having sent a very welcome card of The Lady at the Window, which was
on sale at Christmas time, to our visitors, they, like me, could not
believe the young man behind the counter that there was only a book at
#20 available.
I assumed that some cards would be available at Kelvingrove Art
Gallery, only to be met with a regret that no cards were going to be
published in the future.
It would be interesting to know why this source of a little bit of
culture should be denied to the ratepayers of the city.

AT the end of this month Americans -- or some of them -- will turn off
their television sets. The native land of the sofa spud is holding
National TV-Turnoff Week. Not for a evening, not for a night (don't
forget they've got many 24-hour channels over there), but for a whole
seven days hundreds and thousands of Americans will ban the box.
The event -- can you call a negative action an event? -- has been
inspired by an organisation called TV-Free America, which has tapped
into transatlantic angst about the impact of out-of-control viewing on
productivity, literacy, and the communications skills of the young. Its
co-director, Henry LaBalme, believes that the quality of programmes,
however good, is no defence against the rogue machine. ''It is all TV,''
he says.
''It is passive, primarily visual, non-interactive, encourages
sedentariness, and is non-experiential, essentially vicarious. By its
nature it's non-creative.''
Phew. Quite a mouthful. Regular Herald readers may remember that in
another life, two months ago, I was a television critic, and while I
will not insist that television improves the mind it upsets me to think
that I've spent years of my working life studying a medium which rots
the brain. But let's look a little more closely at Mr LaBalme's lexicon
of accusations.
''Passive.'' Yes, well, you don't jump up and do much when you're
watching television, but you sit pretty quietly in the theatre and
cinema, too. Difference is, I suppose, that you probably only go to the
cinema or theatre once a week at the most.
''Primarily visual.'' There's no denying it. Mind you, an outing to an
art gallery is also primarily visual. In itself, there's nothing wrong
with a visual experience, unless you're unlucky enough to catch an ugly
or upsetting one.
''Non-interactive.'' That sounds the same as passive. The LaBalmes of
the world rarely use one word where two will do.
''Encourages sedentariness.'' So does reading.
''Non-experiential.'' Another term for passive and non-interactive.
''Essentially vicarious.'' Like all forms of drama and narrative.
''Non-creative.'' Only if you never watch Blue Peter, The Beechgrove
Garden, and Floyd on Food.
Like all encyclicals on the nature of television, parts of the LaBalme
pronunciamento ring true. It is an impoverished life which can find
nothing better to do than surf the networks. The medium itself, however,
is merely a tool for the conveyance of good, bad, and indifferent forms
of communication. Like print.
It would be an impoverished life which could find nothing better to do
than read Hello! magazine, but there can't be many students of Hello!
who spend 24 hours a week (the average commitment of British telly
viewers) on the joys and sorrows of five-minute celebrities and other
samples of rich white trash.
Television's problem is the potency of its instant availability. Once
you've bought it you don't have to go out to buy it. It is on stream,
like water or electricity, a public utility. And in many households it
is on all the time, echoing the babble of family life. Do the hectoring
Kilroy or the prattling Fowlers do any more damage than a noisy
neighbour or a garrulous relative? Probably less.
And for the retired television critic, is life fuller, richer, more
experiential, interactive, and creative beyond the screen? How does she
spend her evenings? Improving her conversational Italian? Cultivating
bonsai trees? Painting by numbers? Or watching programmes she really
wants to watch instead of programmes she feels she must?
It would be nice to report one of two things: that life has become
more experiential, interactive, etc, or that television has taken on a
whole new meaning since I stopped viewing it professionally. But neither
of these things has happened. The evenings are more relaxed, I go out
now and then, I read more newspapers. But I still haven't got down to
War and Peace and the time released has been more often taken up by
general pottering. Still, it's early days; come the summer I may take up
tennis again.
As for television -- the critical faculties don't get switched off
overnight. When I watched the first (but not the second) episode of
Hamish Macbeth my hand started twitching for my notebook. But the most
extraordinary thing of all is that I can't find much on any of the
channels that I want to watch for either education, information, or
entertainment. I look at the Radio Times and see a programme which makes
me think, ''That looks as though it might make me want to say something
if I were still reviewing television,'' but I don't want to see it for
fun.
I'm loyal to certain fixtures: EastEnders (but I also listen to The
Archers), Breakfast News, and Newsnight. I've been enjoying The Choir
and I'm absolutely enchanted that Absolutely Fabulous is back. But that
is almost it; apart from The Late Show, which from time to time keeps me
out of bed and by the end of the year it won't even do that, because
it's being dumped by BBC2.
For all its infuriating mannerisms The Late Show has been an arts
strand of spiky intelligence, defying the populism of Channel 4's
Without Walls and the showbiz tendencies of Omnibus and The South Bank
Show. Now it is going; while north of the Border network drama and
network documentary succumbs to what the film-maker Murray Grigor calls
''the gillification of Scotland''. London won't buy it unless it has
seven-point antlers.
It looks as if I got out just in time. Years ago the playwright Tom
Stoppard took a cheap swipe at Edinburgh by calling it ''the Reykjavik
of the South'', a feeble aphorism which has passed into festival lore.
Perhaps if he had known that the cultivated Icelanders long ago took the
decision to devote one night a week to ''TV-Free Iceland'', and don't
broadcast on Thursdays, he would have chosen to avoid insulting both
cities.

Pretoria, Thursday
SOUTH African President Nelson Mandela said after talks with his
government partners today that he would rule on the political future of
his estranged wife Winnie within 24 hours.
Mandela met National Party leader F W de Klerk and Inkatha Freedom
Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to discuss the latest controversy
surrounding Winnie Mandela, hours after the president returned from a
trip to the Gulf.
He dismissed her from her post as Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture,
Science, and technology nearly three weeks ago without giving reasons.
He reinstated her yesterday after she brought a legal action
contesting her dismissal on the grounds that Buthelezi had not been
consulted beforehand, as the constitution lays down.
''I have reinstated her as Deputy Minister because of some procedural
irregularities. I have consulted both Chief Buthelezi and Deputy
President de Klerk on the question and I have their views,'' Mandela
told a news conference after the meeting.
''It is my task to consider their views very carefully before I take
the next move and because this is an important matter, I should not rush
any decision. I propose to make a statement on the matter tomorrow.''
Mandela said there was no dissent among the leaders during the
discussions. ''The consultation has been very smooth and there were no
differences of opinion,'' he said.
Mrs Mandela has often criticised the ruling national unity coalition,
but sources in Mandela's African National Congress said the main reason
for her original dismaissal was her defiance of an instruction to cancel
a trip to West Africa.
During a stopover in Nairobi earlier, Mandela said his government's
credibility remained unshaken despite the botched dismissal. ''The
reputations of governments are not affected by issues of this nature,''
he said.
He acknowledged, however, that he had been badly advised on the issue.
''I think that I have got very good advisers except in this particular
case,'' said Mandela.
A government source said Mandela was likely to dismiss Winnie again
after following the correct constitutional procedures.
National Party spokesman Fanus Schoeman said the incident had
undermined the credibility of Mandela's year-old government, which
includes minority representation by his party and Inkatha.
''For a Minister to fight her dismissal on a technicality makes a
mockery of the democratic system,'' Schoeman said.--Reuter.

JUST when he thought it was safe, Clause Four is returning to give Mr
Blair some worry. Unison, the big public services union, has just voted
to keep the clause, and it will have 11% of the votes at any Labour
conference called to despatch it. And there are signs that the transport
workers will try to make common cause with Unison, which would add
another 14% to those intent on frustrating reform.
It is not certain, however, that even this will stop the change. Mr
Blair proved his ability to win over the party workers in Scotland at
Inverness last month -- and he has already sewn up the MPs, as well as a
good slice of the union vote. Indeed, the sort of opposition big unions
provide may simply work to Mr Blair's advantage by preventing a walkover
at the coming conference. Mr Blair could be forced into making as
effective and passionate a speech as he did at Inverness.
The day has long gone when the big unions could dictate Labour policy
(often to the satisfaction of the leadership). Their affection for
Clause Four may be a matter of nostalgia more than anything else, but
linking it with opposition to the market economy, as some do, is more
disturbing in signalling how a large part of the Labour movement remains
unaware of that economy's role in ensuring a liberal society.
The Blair leadership has endorsed the market economy, pushing it in
the social-market direction by demanding the social chapter of the
Maastricht Treaty and proposing a minimum wage. Mr Blair has so far
refused to put a figure to the minimum -- a failure which upsets the TUC
-- but he will have to do so either before, or at the start of, the next
election since he is in danger of seeming to be clear on everything
except anything specific.
Meanwhile union opposition to his policies (and some are now also
appearing to his educational policies) may do him no harm electorally.
The unions have emerged from a long period of unpopularity, and sharply
declining membership. They have not regained their earlier position, but
fears that Labour in office might defer to them too much are bound to be
an electoral issue next time. Any public suspicion of a return to
anything akin to beer and sandwich negotiations at Downing Street, or to
the unions' power to prevent their own reform, would be bad news for
Labour. With Mr Blair battling against them on Clause Four, minimum wage
policy, and now educational policy, any such return is very unlikely.
As his abrupt, and even ungracious, dropping of the Labour ''luvvies''
this week shows, Mr Blair is a hard political calculator. He will have
worked out early on that anything which shows the Labour Party being
less than friendly to its natural allies simply conveys a desirable
impression of firmness. At the moment the unions have little power
either within the party or the economy. No-one can be sure that this
position would remain entirely unchanged were Labour in office, but no
hard evidence exists to suggest that it would not; and that will give Mr
Blair some comfort as he despatches Clause Four for the umpteenth time.

Law Corresponent Bruce McKain discusses the distinction between
offering professional advice and huckstering in the market place
THANKS to Mrs Thatcher, the legal profession has been forced to pay
homage to the great gods of marketing, advertising and competition. Not
surprisingly, this has led to some unsavoury practices from less
punctilious practitioners -- the kind who think scruples is some kind of
board game and ethics is a county somewhere near Sussex.
Apart from downright dishonesty, we have seen the cutting of costs and
corners, poaching clients and padding out bills and the ''holistic''
aproach to legal advice has become fashionable. Stripped of its
pretensions, this is basically a euphemism for making large dollops of
money from giving people legal advice they don't need.
It is apparently not just a Scottish problem. When the International
Bar Association meets in Edinburgh in June one of the topics down for
discussion is ''Legal practice today: walking the tightrope between
professional ethics and business needs''. Gordon Thomson, the man on the
Harley Davidson, whose high-profile campaign of self-aggrandisement made
him one of our best-known lawyers, has just fallen off the tightrope
into the abyss.
In a scathing judgment, the Scottish Solicitors Discipline Tribunal,
decided without hesitation that neither he nor his wife Maria was fit to
remain as a member of the legal profession.
A number of dates for applications for legal advice and assistance had
been fraudulently altered within the couple's law offices and #30,000
worth of fees which couldn't be justified had to be repaid to the
Scottish Legal Aid Board.
The Thomsons referred to their criminal Legal Aid clients as
''friends'' a term which the discipline tribunal found ''hypocritical''
since systems within their office were ''designed to maximise profit
rather than maintain the quality of service to the clients.
''The interests of clients were sacrificed in the pursuit of fees.''
Solicitor Alex Prentice, president of the Edinburgh Bar Association,
says that the blind pursuit of cash strikes at the heart of the
lawyer/client relationship.
''People are entitled to look to lawyers and know that they are
independent, acting in the interests of the client not their own
interest.
''As a profession we are regulated by a code of practice, and we are
required, quite rightly, to promote our clients' interests and nothing
else.
''At the same time firms are here to make a profit. We employ people
and we have to be profitable to provide the service that we do.
''But if you open up the notion that lawyers are businessmen only,
then assistants in the firm become sales people selling a service to
people who may not want it.''
Alex Prentice accepts that the introduction of Thatcherite market
place philosophy has made it more difficult for solicitors to walk the
line between service and profit, but insists that the vast majority
manage the balancing act honourably and honestly.
He is also in no doubt that it is still possible, despite a long-term
pegging of fees, to make a reasonable living from criminal Legal Aid
work without bending the rules.
''The first objective for a professional is to ensure that the client
is looked after properly -- that proper independent advice is given for
the client's benefit, not the solicitor's.''
Irrespective of whether it might lose the solicitor money?
''Yes. If the correct advice is not to pursue an action then that
advice must be given. I've said to people: ''Look, this is what it's in
your interests to do,'' knowing that if I went to trial I would make a
lot more money for my firm. But that does no service to my client.
''The businessman is there to create business and maximise profits. He
has a product to sell as best he can and market in the best way possible
to generate as much work as he can to make as much money as he can. That
is not what we are about.
''If I provide a good service for someone they may come back to me and
recommend me to someone else. That really is a far better way of
creating work than elaborate campaigns and television adverts.''
Nor does Alex Prentice think it is difficult in most cases to know the
correct course to follow.
''It's not difficult at all, because first and foremost I am a
solicitor. I give advice. I have a lot of experience in the courts. I
know what's possible, what's likely, what's good advice, what's bad
advice.''
Mr Kenneth Pritchard, secretary of the Law Society of Scotland, takes
the view that a high-quality professional service, be it law,
accountancy, medicine or engineering, cannot be completely reconciled
with outright competition.
''A professional is a person whose primary obligation is to his or her
clients and on occasions that makes it a very uncomfortable bedfellow
with the kind of market place which has been created.
''But I am still confident that the great majority of solicitors see
their primary obligation as being a professional, which is defined in
the Oxford Dictionary as a person using a particular learning or skill
for the benefit of others.''
He accepts however that the ethos of competition has irredeemably
changed the face of the legal profession in Scotland, and, in his view,
the public is likely to suffer in the long run.
''Solicitors have effectively been forced to advertise the fees they
charge over the whole wide spectrum of work they do.
''It's now quite usual for a potential client to phone a solicitor to
ask: 'How much would you charge for buying or selling my house?' If the
solicitor is silly enough to give a quote over the telephone the client
then phones another solicitor and says: 'I already have a quote for a
particular sum. Can you do it for less?'
''Now, there are certain essential steps in any transaction that have
to be properly and competently carried out. We are now seeing fees being
charged where these essential steps for the protection of the client
cannot possibly be done at the sort of bottom-range fees that are being
charged.
''I have absolutely no doubt that what's going to happen is that
people in a profession which is over-populated are going to accept
business at unreasonably low fees.
''They will either do a first-class job which will then lead them to
insolvency or they will cut corners, putting both themselves and their
clients at risk.
''There are going to be far fewer solicitors available on the High
Street for the ordinary member of the public who wants to buy and sell a
house, wind up an estate or prepare a will.
''If the fees for that type of work are driven down to quite
unacceptably low levels solicitors simply won't be able to practise in
those fields.''
Ken Pritchard thinks that, on a rather uneasy basis, professionalism
and competition will just have to live together.
''What is utterly wrong is to go too far down the route of marketing
and promotion of your own firm to increase your fee income by what can
be described as thoroughly unethical fee creation and work generation.''

IS the National Lottery in danger of becoming more a curse than a
blessing? The sad case of Mr Tim O'Brien, the Liverpool man who shot
himself after omitting to renew the lottery numbers which would have
brought him and a friend around #2m, should hasten the asking of some
hard questions.
As the starting point, it should be understood that a major social
change is being engineered by the Government. For the first time it is
actively involved in the promotion of gambling. That may be a good or
bad change in policy, depending on your viewpoint. But it is certainly a
significant one, and should be recognised as such.
Until the decision to proceed with the lottery was taken, the
Government adhered to the long-standing policy of ''non-stimulation'' of
gambling. In other words, it didn't try to stop it -- which would have
been futile and an intrusion into personal freedom -- but the gambling
industry had very limited scope to advertise or promote itself.
That approach has now been stood on its head. A phenomenal amount of
advertising backs up the National Lottery. Its appeal to the dream of a
shortcut to wealth beyond comprehension could hardly be less subtle.
Paid-for advertising is topped up by the BBC's promotional efforts. Its
vested interest is Saturday night ratings, but the consequence is a
barrage of lottery advertising on the BBC -- with full Government
sanction.
Inevitably this has led to demands for similar treatment from
threatened branches of the gambling industry. Radio and television
advertising for the football pools has now been granted for the first
time. Other similar concessions will follow. Bookies, bingo promoters,
and casinoes are all making demands for greater liberalisation in order
to compete, they say, with the National Lottery.
One by one they are being granted, which may only be fair. But the
overall effect, as a result of the National Lottery being hyped so
shamelessly to ensure its success, is a completely transformed set of
rules surrounding gambling in all its forms. The days of
''non-stimulation'' are gone, and the consequences of that change are
difficult to foresee.
Until the lottery was established, there was general recognition that
only a small and finite amount of money per head was available for
long-odds gambling. It was the role of government to accept taxes from
what was spent, but not to encourage an expansion of household spending
in this direction. The expectation was that a national lottery would be
largely at the expense of other forms of gambling -- particularly the
pools.
This has indeed happened to a significant extent, and the pools have
been hit so hard that they are now being granted a 5% cut in betting
duty to prevent further job losses and their withdrawal from funding the
admirable Foundation for Sport and Arts. This was a large warning sign
that there are losers as well as winners as a result of the National
Lottery.
But the real surprise of the National Lottery has been the amount of
additional gambling money it has pulled in. Recent research by the
Henley Centre for Forecasting suggests that 81% of Scots are
participating, and more than 70% in the rest of the country. To a large
extent, their investments represent small and harmless flutters.
Within the Henley figures, however, the evidence is beginning to show
through that the biggest lottery spenders are not those who can best
afford it. This is certainly the experience of other countries which
have similar types of high-jackpot national lotteries. In so far as the
lottery is a substitute for or contributor to taxation, it is a highly
regressive one.
As the Henley Centre report observes: ''In a society riddled by
economic uncertainty and shaken by loss of faith, winning the lottery
provides the ultimate safety net.'' And losing it can become a matter of
life and death.
The chief beneficiary of the lottery is Camelot, the company which was
given the highly lucrative contract to operate it. It really was the one
that could not lose on the deal, but the extent to which the rules have
been written to ensure that it enjoys the minimum risk and maximum
profitability is startling, even by the standards of this Government.
The stories which are now beginning to filter through about charities
losing out are the tip of a very large iceberg. Those which depend on
lotteries of any kind for income will be first to feel the pinch, but
the experience of other countries suggests that straightforward giving
will also take a nose-dive, as spare pounds go on the lottery.
I find it difficult to understand why Camelot should have been allowed
to go beyond the basic lottery competition, into the field of scratch
cards. This takes it into direct conflict with tens of thousands of
fund-raising efforts around the country, none of which has the power of
Government or the backing of limitless advertising behind it. Many will
go to the wall.
Of course the National Lottery will pour funds into sport, arts, and
charities. It could hardly fail to do so on the basis of current
revenue. But it will still only be 12p in every pound spent which goes
into the good causes. The balance sheet of National Lottery gains and
losses will be a lot more complex in a few years time than it may appear
at present.
The lottery is here to stay and it is unrealistic to think otherwise.
But that should not stop the questions being asked -- the size of
jackpots, the scale of advertising, the role of Camelot, its overlap
into other gambling games. With the lottery now well established, it
might not be a bad idea to let it settle down and for Government to
readopt the principle of non-stimulation of gambling.
It is probably too hooked on the cash to contemplate that, but might
still bear in mind that this would not be the first example of Camelot
resulting in more grief than happiness.

COUNCILLORS have agreed to give cash to a controversial #20,000 statue
plan -- but only by one vote.
Earlier this week it was revealed that Dundee planned to erect a
statue of the late Tommy Small, who sold newspapers in the streets for
60 years.
The life-size bronze sculpture is set to grace the site of his last
pitch on the corner of High Street and Reform Street.
The public have not been consulted, but Scottish Enterprise Tayside is
putting up #5000 of public money.
Tayside Regional Council's planning committee yesterday approved a
#5000 contribution.
The vote was tied eight-eight and approval was given on the casting
vote of committee convener Alex Shand, who represents an Abroath ward on
the council.
The decision will now go to the next full council meeting and
Conservative Councillor Neil Powrie, a vociferous opponent of the plan,
vowed to continue his campaign to defeat the statue proposal.
He said: ''It's hardly a ringing endorsement that major expenditure
should be proceeded with on the casting vote of an Arbroath councillor.
''There is obviously significant concern or the vote would not have
been so close.
''On no other issue have I had such a reaction from the public. People
think this idea is mad.
''It makes a laughing stock of the city. There are people far more
worthy for this honour than a newspaper seller.''
Mr Shand said: ''The majority of Dundee councillors on the committee
wanted this statue and I followed their wishes.''

TARANTO: An Italian university student who found a winning lottery
ticket worth 100m lire (#39,000) in a rubbish bin and returned it to its
owner, a deaf and dumb boy, was yesterday hailed as a hero.
Marcello Pagliacci, 27, retrieved the ticket after seeing its owner,
who thought it was worthless, throw it in a bin in the southern city of
Taranto.
''Marcello is a normal boy. He was just doing his duty,'' Pagliacci's
mother told reporters clamouring for a word with her son. However he had
left for his Easter holidays.
The identity of the deaf and dumb boy was not known, but the Ansa news
agency said he came from a poor family who could use the money.--Reuter.

HOUSING associations must improve links with ethnic minorities if the
growing problem of racial harassment in rural and urban areas in the
West of Scotland is to be tackled effectively, according to Strathclyde
Community Relations Council.
It announced yesterday the setting up of a West of Scotland Racial
Equality in Housing Forum.
The council's community relation's officer, Mrs Maggie Chetty, said
the forum would aim to train more people from ethnic minorities in
housing management. She also said it was essential that more victims of
harassment should seek redress in the courts.
The council's housing and complaints officer, Mr Derek Goh, said that
last year it dealt with 170 racial harassment complaints. Many of these
came from families desperate to be rehoused in so-called safe areas in
Glasgow, such as Pollokshields, Woodside, and Charing Cross.
There was, however, little council housing available in these areas,
so housing associations would have to forge links with communities,
provide accommodation for refugees, remove racist graffiti, and cater
for the needs of extended families and the elderly.
But the initiative has not pleased all of Strathclyde's ethnic
minority groups. Robina Qureshi, race and housing officer with the
Housing Equality Action Unit, said the only way to tackle ethnic
minority concerns was to set up ethnic minority-led housing associations
along the lines of those operating in England. , But Mr Goh said
ethnic-led associations created ghettos and were not wanted by the
community.
The initiative only a week after a Council for Racial Equality report
painted a bleak picture of racial harassment south of the Border. That
report said some of the worst incidents had happened in small towns and
villages, where ethnic minority families were often extremely isolated.

Is the true meaning of Easter lost in commercial confections? JOHN
LINKLATER conducts a vox choc.
MOST get the connection with rolling away the stone, with a little
prompting. But the #300m we will have spent on chocolate eggs by this
weekend is difficult to present as a revivalist phenomenon. Firmly at
the centre of our Easter Sunday is creme fondant, or truffles, or
Smarties, or Buttons.
''I don't know what the Easter egg represents,'' says a candid Janice
Morrison. ''If it's Easter you get an egg; or I'd better get one -- from
my boyfriend.''
To get a slightly less secularised account of why we give Easter eggs,
you are advised to approach a primary school age citizen. Aileen
Anderson (8) confers with her mother before offering her version. ''It's
to celebrate the crucifiction,'' she advises. To be fair, she has the
answer, but is consumed by shyness; or she's too busy consuming the egg.
''When you roll the egg down the hill,'' she continues, and she's got
it. ''It's like the stone being rolled away.'' The stone, of course, is
a further dissertation, but Aileen knows that it was at the entrance of
the ''cave''. And out of the cave came the risen Christ. The Easter egg
symbolises the Resurrection.
So tell that to the manufacturers of Britain's best-selling little
egg. Cadbury's came up with the idea in 1923, and havelong since given
up any attempt at representing anything other than a lightly boiled egg
with a runny yolk.
It in facthas more to do with pagan fertility rites at Easter, which
actually pre-date anything the Christian festival borrowed from German
and Russian traditions.
The Cadbury's Creme Egg divides the human race more profoundly than
the split that Swift chronicled satirically between the Bigendians and
the Littlendians. By taste, temperament and probably some deeply
revealing psychology, folk are either for the chocolatey shell, or the
sticky experience in the middle.
An advertising campaign exploited the endless idiosyncracy with which
individuals attack the thing. Caroline Dunsmore (16) is unapologetic
about the business. She bites the top, inserts a delicate finger and
contentedly laps it clean. It is this kind of private indulgence that
allows the manufacturers to shift 200 million of the little indulgences.
They seem to get smaller every year, and so does the religious
connection.
''The gospel message is lost,'' tirades Peter Young, who takes two
minutes out of his soap-box sermon to less than attentive shoppers on
Argyle Street to address the question. ''Holy days are turned into
holidays, Easter eggs get bigger and children get sicker. It is material
pressure of the commercial world to make a corrupt, godless society. The
symbolism is lost to profits and iniquity.''
The Easter parade, Easter bonnets, or even the Easter bunny (who is
supposed to be responsible for this over-fecundity of confectionaried
religion), are never confronted with the same charge of spiritual
betrayal that is reserved for the Easter egg. Where something is sweet,
trouble is waiting to hatch.
''I am a Christian,'' says Elaine Mitchell (19). ''I know that the
Easter egg represents the rolling away of the stone. But I just eat them
and get fat.''

A WEST Lothian doctor waded across a river to reach an unconscious
schoolboy who had slipped 50 yards down an embankment and then dropped
25ft on to a stone ledge.
The 11-year-old, from Darlington in County Durham, was spending the
Easter holidays with relatives near Falkirk. He is in the intensive care
unit of Edinburgh's Western General Hospital with head and spinal
injuries.
Colin Melvin's 14-year-old sister Deborah and his grandmother, who had
been out walking with him, watched in horror as he plunged down the
embankment close to the Union Canal and a few hundred yards from Manual
Mill Farm, Linlithgow.
Yesterday the GP and his wife, who did not want to be named, told how
the alarm was raised when a fisherman came to their door.
The doctor drove his Land Rover down a field and then waded across the
River Avon to reach the injured boy.
''There was another fisherman with the child, who had landed on a
ledge after his fall. He was lucky he hadn't gone into the water.''
The couple praised their four children who had helped give directions
to the emergency services -- an ambulance and four fire units -- and had
relayed messages at the farm. They had also taken blankets to the rescue
spot.
''The child's grandmother was naturally very upset, and indicated she
and the boy's sister had no idea how the accident had happened. He must
have strayed off the public footpath in the area,'' the doctor added.

Why do people crave chocolate? Does it stimulate the kidneys or the
brain, and is it really a substitute for sex? ARVIND K SALWAN separates
the myths from silver paper.
IT'S Easter once more, and due to soaring demand, chickens up and down
the nation are frantically laying eggs -- chocolate eggs that is. The
advertisers are out in force trying to grab our attention from every
conceivable angle. But what about the chocolate itself: is this
beautiful, luxurious food of the Gods really addictive for us mere
chocoholic mortals?
Plenty of people think so, although science has yet to prove it. There
is certainly no other food which is surrounded by so much mythology, and
thanks to clever advertising, pure lustful and sexual wish-fulfilment,
corny as it may appear.
The average British consumer gets through 7.3kgs of chocolate a year,
with women and children enjoying significantly more than men. Women
account for 39% of annual chocolate consumption in Britain, children
35%, and men 26%. There is little doubt that the appetite for chocolate
is influenced by mood. In some women, bingeing on chocolate can be
linked to the monthly cycle and is used as a means of relieving
pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS).
But are the effects pharmacological or simply emotional? Scientists
and psychologists are divided in their opinions.
Some scientists believe chocolate is a sex substitute, as every 100gs
contains 660mgs of phenylethylamine (C6,H5(CH2)2NH2), a stimulant
closely related to the body's own dopamine and adrenaline. It raises
blood pressure and heart rate, heightening sensation and blood glucose
levels. In short, it induces a high similar in kind, if not intensity,
to sexual climax.
Others believe chocolate is a stimulant rather like tea or coffee.
Every 100gms also contains 5mgs of caffeine-like substances, though it
would take a massive binge to achieve the same kick!
The pleasure of chocolate comes because it melts in your mouth. It is
a solid at room temperature and gradually softens in your mouth, melting
at just below body temperature. As it melts, heat is absorbed from the
lining of the mouth, giving the eater a pleasant sensation. It is the
cocoa butter -- the fat squeezed out of the cocoa beans during
production -- that gives chocolate this unusual quality.
Despite being one of the most saturated fats known, it behaves
differently from others. Thus it has little or no effect on serum
cholesterol levels, and so tastes nice, but is (thankfully for addicts)
poorly absorbed.
Scientists claim it is the ingredients in chocolate that attract us;
psychologists disagree.
According to John Harwood, professor of biochemistry at the University
College of Wales, Cardiff, chocolate helps to stimulate organs such as
the kidneys rather than the brain, and so (cocoa) makes a good bedtime
drink.
However, psychologist and nutritionist David Booth, from the
University of Birmingham, argues that chocolate consumption relates to
emotional and social conditioning in early years. He feels it is not the
food you get to like but rather the situation in which you have eaten
it, and if it delivered a satisfying amount of calories.
Harwood retaliates by saying that chocolate consumption always seems
to go up in times of recession and that ''it is a treat that everyone
can afford''.
According to Pauline Weaver of Cadbury, sales boomed in the depression
of the 1930s, and people were not affected in the recent economic slump
either. In 1991, despite the recession, Britons bought #2.8m worth of
chocolate, 7.5% more than the year before. This trend seems to be
continuing into the nineties.
Booth's argument is backed by Peter Rogers of the Consumer Sciences
Department, Institute of Food Research, Reading. Rogers's findings show
people crave chocolate because social norms state we should eat it with
restraint.
Connoisseurs really don't mind who's right and who's wrong as long as
the chocolate is easily and readily available.
So before tucking into the first of your many Easter eggs spare a
thought for all those eggs-hausted chickens that have made this Easter
such a wonderful experience for you. And I thought I could write it
without any egg yolks creeping in, sorry jokes . . . oops!

A REPORT by water department officials in Fife on last month's
contamination scare at Freuchie has been submitted to the
procurator-fiscal in Cupar, it was confirmed yesterday.
At the centre of their inquiries was vegetable producing company
Kettle Produce, which cooperated with regional council engineers to
establish how polluted water found its way into the mains system.
About 600 people, half the population of the village, were vaccinated
against possible infection from the virus hepatitis A.
The board said later that all those affected by enteritis-related
illnesses had since recovered. They included a child who was treated at
the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh.
A spokesman for the region said yesterday that, besides submitting a
report to the fiscal's department, an explanatory report was also being
prepared for circulation to the villagers.
The matter will also be discussed by the regional council's
engineering services committee next week.

THE president of An Comunn Gaidhealach has been ousted as the Mod
organising body prepares for a shake-up which is seen as the last chance
for its continued survival.
Donald Macritchie, a design engineer with Western Isles Council, has
held the top office with the century-old organisers of the Royal
National Mod, the annual Gaelic cultural festival, for the last five
years. He has been with the organisation for the last 17 years.
He recently admitted: ''I think of resigning after every Mod.''
Mull-born Ann Draper, a former Mod gold medallist, who lives in
Aberdeen, will officially be confirmed as the new president at the
annual meeting of An Comunn Gaidhealach (The Highland Association) in
June.
The changes at the top come as outside consultants are about to
deliver a wide-ranging review of An Comunn's role and methods of
preserving Gaelic culture.
Mr Macritchie, 43, was the youngest-ever president, and is from Point
in Lewis. He was not helped in his bid to stay on by becoming embroiled
in an ongoing industrial tribunal, where former director Donnie Maclean,
58, is claiming unfair dismissal.
In the first half of the tribunal in January, Mr Macritchie and chief
executive Donald John Macsween, also from Point, were forced
persistently to deny suggestions by Mr Maclean's solicitor that they
conspired to get rid of him. Mr Macsween was brought in as a hitman, it
was even suggested.
The allegations and counter-allegations have not helped Mr
Macritchie's status with fellow executive committee members. They are
keen to keep An Comunn, the senior organisation of Gaeldom, as free as
possible from any hint of scandal.
During one memorable exchange at the first half of the industrial
tribunal in January, Mr Macritchie was asked if he had at any time
thought of resigning over the messed-up finances of the Airdrie Mod in
1993.
He stunned the tribunal by replying coolly: ''I think of resigning
after every Mod.''
The adjourned tribunal has not even reconvened before his departure.
The tribunal, where Mr Maclean, a former teacher and BBC producer, is
demanding his old job back, is due to resume in Stornoway on May 22.
Only last week Mr Macritchie and Mr Macsween both denied whispers that
he had been toppled in a high-level coup.
Mr Macritchie had said: ''We shall have to wait and see if I'm
re-elected in June. I shall be standing.''
But the ballot of An Comunn's ard-chomhairle (the executive committee)
members was actually held in Glasgow four weeks ago.
Yesterday Mr Macritchie and the chief executive were finally forced to
admit that the rumours were true.
Both were reluctant to comment other than to say they were looking
forward to the consultants' report which will be delivered to An Comunn
on April 26.
Mr Macritchie said: ''The report is funded by HIE with support from
Comunn na Gaidhlig), the Gaelic development body.
''We know that if An Comunn is to regain its rightful place as a
cultural body, we need high-calibre younger staff to promote An Comunn.
We've also neglected our membership and we will be moving to address
that. Basically, we're at a crossroads.''
The sacked director, Mr Maclean, confirmed yesterday he had heard of
the ousting of one of the main tribunal witnesses against him. He said:
''I have nothing to say about this.''
Vice-president Duncan Ferguson was also ousted in the Glasgow ballot.
Neil Brownlie, a writer and poet from Larbert, near Stirling, and a
stalwart of the old-fashioned An Comunn, takes over that role.
This year's Royal National Mod is to be in Golspie in Sutherland.

A MIXED reaction yesterday greeted Scottish Office proposals to amend
the school boards legislation.
The Scottish School Boards Association, which represents 65% of
boards, welcomed proposals to regularise elections for board places.
But its president, Mrs Ann Hill, said she was disappointed that there
were no plans to make it a legal requirement on local authorities to
tell boards about serious disciplinary action against headteachers.
The SSBA had called on the Government to inform boards of such
instances after the school board and wider parental community at St
Columba's secondary in Gourock successfully campaigned for the retention
of headteacher Gerry McKenna.
Strathclyde region had planned to remove him and transfer him to a
school in Glasgow after allegations of mismanagement. But it abandoned
the plans after they were successfully appealed.
Under the current legislation, education authorities are under no
obligation to inform boards of such disciplinary action.
But Mrs Hill said it should be common courtesy for school board chairs
to be told in these cases. It would also guarantee democratic
accountability, she said.
''If serious disciplinary action were being taken the chairman should
at least be told, although confidentiality would prevail. The local
councillor is told, and that should extend to the chairman, who is
elected by parents.''
Despite her disappointment she added: ''This is a consultation
document, and we will be back in there.''
Mrs Hill said the proposals for school board elections and parental
representation in smaller schools were ''welcome and long overdue''.
The Scottish Office plans to introduce terms of office which would
expire on a common date, leading to the two-yearly elections being held
in the same period.
At present, authorities have to hold elections in individual schools
throughout the session because board members' terms of office expire on
different dates.
This, said the Scottish Office, was inconvenient for boards, confusing
for parents, expensive for authorities, and a waste of staff time and
resources.
It also proposed putting a time limit of three months for by-elections
when elections on the expiry of office fail to attract enough parent
members.
To make it easier for boards to continue in existence, they would be
able to co-opt a parent member within three months to fill a vacancy. At
present, if a by-election for a parent member is unsuccessful, the board
would be disestablished if a parent majority did not exist.
To ease the burden on small schools, those with up to 75 pupils will
need three parents and one co-opted member for their boards. At present,
schools with up to 500 pupils need four parents and two co-opted
members.
The Education Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, said school
boards had become a respected part of the education system, but some
legislative changes were needed to make them operate in the most
effective way.
Views are sought on the proposed changes by June 19. Lord James said
the proposals responded to representations from education authorities
and boards.

Foreigners in their own country: Elizabeth Buie on the problems of
being black and Scottish
It is all too easy to assume that racial problems do not exist in
Scotland to the extent they do in the larger cities of England. Speak to
some of the young, black, and Asian people in Edinburgh who have formed
the Lothian Black Youth Forum, however, and you would have cause to stop
and think.
These young men and women, aged from 15 upwards, all born and bred in
Scotland, evince an almost palpable sense of alienation. They do not
find it easy being black and Scottish.
The forum, which met for the first time last August, sprang from an
initiative from Mr Dharmendra Kanani, acting director of the Lothian
Racial Equality Council. Unfortunately for the members, he is moving to
London. His post in Edinburgh has been frozen because of the financial
cutbacks imposed, by the Home Office, on the Commission for Racial
Equality.
Six months ago, however, his concern was that young black people in
Edinburgh had nowhere to go and nothing to do in their free time. You do
not find them hanging about in the streets, but nor are they in youth
clubs, community centres, or pubs.
Quite simply they are frightened to go to these places because they
are likely to be racially harassed. Instead, by their own admission,
they hang around with friends who own cars, drive about, or go up
Arthur's Seat. It is not healthy for them, nor for the community. For,
as Mr Kanani points out, unless these racial tensions are addressed
constructively, the time will come when young black people will stop
turning the other cheek and start fighting back.
There is already a climate of gang warfare in schools. In Glasgow, he
says, it is ''rife''.
''If racial attacks continue to provoke no reaction from the police or
the education departments, what is left? The young people can turn to
their families or fight back. Eventually they will fight back,'' he
said.
Rather than have that happen, he is trying to provide them with an
area where they can share experiences, develop non-violent, but
effective, methods of resisting racism, and where they can develop a
sense of confidence about being black in Scotland.
He says it was only when they started talking at the forum that some
of the young Asian women realised that they were not alone in feeling a
sense of shame at wishing at times that they were white.
He quotes the case of one girl who complained that after every physics
class at school, she and only she, was made to stay behind and clean up.
After attending a couple of forum meetings, she found the confidence to
say to her teacher: ''Do you have a problem with my skin colour?'' ''The
teacher felt quite threatened then. Now there is a different
relationship,'' said Mr Kanani.
When some members of the forum spoke about their feelings of
inequality and anger about unequal treatment, it was just a few days
before the end of Ramadan in the Islamic calendar.
''This month is a blessing month for Muslims. We are supposed to keep
a fast so that we can appreciate food and water -- things we take for
granted,'' said Mohammad Riaz, 20, who is training to be a youth worker
with ethnic minorities.
Other forum members talked with anger and frustration at the attitude
within the school system of teachers and other pupils during Ramadan.
''They treat Ramadan as a joke. A teacher will say: 'What a shame you
can't have lunch'. The kids just have a laugh and eat in front of you,''
said one.
The problem starts as early as nursery and primary school -- it is too
easy for a teacher to ignore things when one child calls another ''a
Paki''. ''We feel pushed aside right from the beginning. They treat us
as if we can't understand, but we can. We have got feelings as well. We
get racial remarks right from that time. It makes you feel so bad
inside. Teachers should explain that it is not acceptable.
''Then it boils up in secondary and at college and you come to
breaking point,'' said one member.
This sense of injustice is directed not only at the school
authorities, but at the police as well.
Some members tell of an occasion when the police were called when they
were all on a bus on their way to Friday prayers. After reports of
trouble -- trouble which they deny -- they were all removed from the
bus, searched thoroughly, and reported to the leaders of their
community.
A white youth, they claim, was allowed to remain on the bus, and
hardly searched at all.
Another member said: ''You used to feel it was your fault, or you felt
it was your parents' fault that they came into this country. If you make
someone welcome, obviously he is going to stay. But from day one, if you
are not welcome, you are never going to feel it's your own home country.
I was born and bred here. You start to feel a particular sense of
affinity, and then someone says: 'Go back home, Paki'. It totally
obliterates any sense of belonging.''
What, then, is the answer? All the young members of the forum agreed
that segregated schools would not help.''They would not reflect the
reality we live in. We have to interact with people,'' they said.
From their point of view, they were determined to provide role models
for other members of their community, to find good jobs, not be ''stuck
in family shops'', even if it meant having to have twice as many
qualifications.
Because of the fact that there are far fewer ethnic minority people
living in Scotland, there is perhaps a tendency to assume that life is
perhaps easier for minority groups here. The opposite is the truth,
according to Mr Kanani.
In parts of London, because blacks are relatively numerous, it is much
easier for young people to find an identity and be confident about
themselves. They can go to work in Asian dress without feeling
conspicuous. Other people working alongside them are more likely to be
observing religious festivals at the same time.
Asked for their solution, members of the Lothian Youth Black Forum say
that central Government should do more, particularly in education. Mr
Kanani would like to see the Commission for Racial Equality given more
teeth, more resources, and for the Government to create a specific
offence of racial violence.
But even were all these measures taken on board, the question still
remains as to whether they would stop one pupil telling his or her
classmate to: ''Go back home, Paki.''

THE Tory candidate in the Perth and Kinross by-election is to
undertake a 100-mile sponsored walk across the constituency to raise
money for charity.
With all the money going to Riding for the Disabled, Mr John Godfrey
will start his ''Perthshire Progress'' on Saturday at St Fillans on the
western edge of the constituency. He will then head eastward for five
days, reaching Invergowrie on Wednesday.
Mr Godfrey, however, denied that the sponsored walk was a cynical
attempt to try to increase his share of the poll. He said: ''The walk
was planned before we knew there was going to be a by-election. It will
be a break from politics and I will not be handing out leaflets.''
Mr Godfrey continued: ''While this kind of walk is a great way to meet
people and see the constituency, there is a more important reason for me
in raising money for this charity. My father was disabled and I came
close to it when I escaped permanent injury in a riding accident.
''From personal experience, I believe it's important that disabled
people have the same opportunity to experience activities that the
able-bodied do. As a keen rider, that's why I'm giving my support to
riding for the disabled , which gives so many disabled people, young and
old, a chance to try something new and exciting like the freedom
experienced while horse riding.''
Mr Godfrey said that, having done two sponsored walks in the past, he
was confident of completing his 100-mile Perthshire trek and raising a
four-figure sum.
In 1986 he walked 160 miles from Mallaig to Nairn and raised #1500 for
the Mallaig lifeboat and #1500 for the Highland Hospice in Inverness.
Last year, he covered 85 miles from Ardrossan to Helensburgh and raised
#1000 for the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow.
Day one will take Mr Godfrey from St Fillans to Crieff. Day two ends
in Dunning while day three will see him walk from Dunning to Kinross.
Day four ends in Perth with the final leg of the journey taking him to
Invergowrie.

Roger Freed looks at the plight of German shoppers who face their own
supermarket dash.
SHOPPING is not an easy thing for those who have to work in Germany.
Imagine working a normal job until 5 o'clock or later, going home,
changing clothes, catching your breath, then running out to the
supermarket and having to race with all the other folks who are trying
to get their daily needs bought before the 6.30 closing time. It makes
for a stressful life.
In Germany, by law, all stores must close by 6.30 in the evening
during the weekdays, with Thursdays being an exception. In smaller towns
it is usually 6pm. This makes it fairly quiet during the day when only
the pensioners, children, mothers and unemployed shop but, come 5.15,
when all the workers start pouring in then the frustration factor rises
incredibly. The law, a reflection of the largely socialist government
here, is intended to protect the food market workers from exploitation
by the store owners but unwittingly throws a heavy burden upon the rest
of the working class who have to rush their already work-tired bodies
from here to there to buy necessities. The later opening till 8.30pm on
Thursdays was pushed through only after much fighting in the Parliament
in the late 1980s.
Punctuality is also important. Clerks will close the door in your face
at exactly 6.30, sometimes even five minutes before time in order to
clean up and leave early.
Saturdays offer some relief. Most stores are open until 12, in the
larger cities some stay open until 2pm. Of course, they are packed the
entire morning. The first Saturday of every month is ''Langer Samstag''
when all the stores are allowed to keep their doors open until 4pm.
After that, all is locked up tight until 8am Monday. Those in dire need
can find tourist shops in the main train stations of larger cities and
petrol stations along the major avenues that sell a few staples at
exorbitant prices on Saturday evenings and Sundays.
Unfortunately, it isn't just in the consumer aspect of social life
that the average German loses out. Libraries generously stay open until
7pm on weekdays, giving the working reader only about one hour's reading
time, if that. Weekends, when most people have their leisure time, the
doors are bolted. That leaves only the retired and the rich who can
enjoy the tax sponsored facilities -- and the rich can surely buy their
own books.
City and government offices are sometimes downright cruel in their
hours. The times can range wildly but most fall in the span between 8
and 12. A few are even comical, having times such as 9 to 11.15 or 9.30
to 11. One postal office in Munich requires that you take a number on
Monday morning and then return another day to use it. All this means
that the worker must lose at least a half day's wages every time he pays
the bureaucrats a visit. This can make a serious dent in the wage cheque
of a man or woman supporting a family. Of course, the labyrinthine
German bureaucracy makes it so that one must not visit only one office
to get papers stamped but several. A few agencies with some degree of
social consciousness do have a couple of hours opening time on Thursday
afternoons, but one can still expect to eat a late supper due to the
long queues.
Doctors and dentists offices are crammed in their opening hours,
mostly also 8 to 12am. Those using social insurance, which would be
almost all of the working class patients, get herded through conveyor
belt style. For minor medical problems on the weekends or late at night
one druggist in a city area will have someone on duty 24 hours, but it
rotates from druggist to druggist regularly and one must know beforehand
which is open or else drive around till he finds it.
With luck this might shortly change. There is now a proposal before
the German Representative body that would, over a number of years, raise
the closing times up to 8pm. For many here, with the exception, perhaps,
of the store workers, it would be a welcome relief.

Mark Fisher reports on much hand-wringing as Glasgow's major festival
prepares for this year's launch.
PUT any two Glasgow arts organisations in a room together and watch
the sparks fly. But they won't be arguing about the respective merits of
their own work -- they'll be laying into this year's Mayfest.
So what's the problem? Any change of policy would always have raised a
bit of a storm, and the new-look Mayfest, under the directorship of Paul
Bassett, previously the money-man at the Citizens' Theatre, has heralded
a bigger change than most.
He's not only taken on the task of getting rid of the #150,000 deficit
inherited from the high-profile, high-spending festivals since the
culture capital days of 1990 (although as a percentage of the festival's
turnover that deficit is not insupportable), he's also made a
philosophical shift back to Mayfest's supposed historical roots as a
community-based event.
''The idea is to allow people to feel part of Mayfest,'' Bassett
explained on these pages, ''and not feel they are having culture imposed
on them.''
To this end, he's taken a bottom-up approach, responding to what the
people of Glasgow want, not what he thinks they should see. The
programme is no longer an international hotch-potch but a celebration of
the work of artists, theatre-makers, musicians and community groups,
predominantly from the Glasgow area. Ticket prices have been kept as
affordable as possible.
This is no longer a festival of glamorous exotic specialities from
abroad, with the community programme shunted apologetically to one side,
but a ''showcase'' for the ''burgeoning talent'' of the city.
As a theory it's cogent, even laudable, although it seems odd that
last year's 42 community venues and 71 headline music acts are not
represented on anything like the same scale this year. Only practice
will tell whether it really will capture the popular imagination, but
it's fair to say that Mayfest was in need of some kind of a shake-up.
Over the past 12 years it had evolved into an oddly shaped creature
that wasn't what it started life as; that wasn't the Edinburgh Festival
or Avignon or anywhere else, but that wasn't too sure what it actually
was.
You could argue, indeed I would argue, that it is patronising -- a
form of inverse snobbery -- to assume that the people of Glasgow were
indifferent to the performances that were previously ''imposed'' on
them; that they would rather have been checking out the local talented
amateurs than suffering the obligation of some stunning work -- and
there has been a lot of it -- from Canada or South Africa or Cuba or
England, or wherever.
But Paul Bassett, as festival director, has every right to put his
theory to the test. Perhaps Glasgow doesn't appreciate its status as a
major European city. Perhaps it really would rather have a
lowest-common-denominator festival.
No, it's not so much Bassett's programme that is generating disquiet,
although the announcement this week that the NVA Organisation has been
forced to postpone the performances of Stormy Waters, the large-scale
Clydeside end-of-festival spectacular, means that Bassett has been left
with only one event -- Robert Lepage's Needles and Opium -- of major
international appeal (the popular dance of Discorama and strictly
ballroom couple Donnie and Gaynor notwithstanding).
The NVA Organisation, it must be said, has been very happy with
Mayfest's support, and the loss of Stormy Waters, a show that had both
mass appeal and grand artistic ambition, because of a delay in raising
funds, must be a sore and unfortunate loss to Bassett.
But what is really worrying the arts community are the organisational
changes behind the new-improved Mayfest. Bassett has introduced a style
of management which, in its radicalism, eclipses any of the changes in
the artistic policy. When he took over from the previous artistic
director, Robert Robson, he was given permission by the Mayfest board to
restructure the organisation as he saw fit.
What followed was a complete purging of the festival's administration.
Some people were allowed to reapply for their own jobs, though
invariably they didn't get them, and in the cases of some employees,
such as those in the press and marketing department, there were no jobs
left to apply for.
Bassett's contract was extended from one year to three, and Mayfest
entered the new year with a crack team of just four staff who, somehow,
were expected to do everything. No more publicity, no more sponsorship,
no more technical crew. So much for your People's Festival.
At this point, the anecdotal evidence starts to mount up. Nothing too
incriminating on its own, except there's an awful lot of it.
There's the bewilderment that there was no press launch for the
festival -- the cheapest and simplest way to generate positive publicity
and to explain the new way of doing things -- ''That's so basic it's 'O'
Grade publicity,'' said one marketing expert. Then, at a time when the
administration already seemed to be falling behind, there was the sudden
departure of two key members of staff after an internal row about the
programme's presentation.
Next came the dissatisfaction felt by several companies about the
descriptions of their work in the programme, and about inaccuracies in
the information provided, not to mention the difficulty in making sense
of the programme as a whole.
The Drama Centre at the Ramshorn is so distressed at the way its
line-up has been listed that it has cancelled four of its productions,
including an important retrospective of the work of leading Scottish
choreographer Rosina Bonsu. ''I feel that we've been cheated,'' says the
centre's director Susan Triesman. ''The way the programme operates
militates against anyone coming.''
In a letter he sent out to venue managers with copies of the
programme, Bassett apologised in advance of any criticism. He explained
that the new team had only been in place since the autumn and that in
the process of ''reinventing'' Mayfest, the programme had ''inevitably
been a rush job''. Suggestions for next year would be welcome, and
meanwhile Mayfest would try and help out with any additional publicity
that was required.
To be fair, Bassett's approach is being welcomed in some quarters.
Andy Arnold, artistic director of the Arches Theatre, says that although
he felt some uncertainty at first, he's now very positive, not least
because his own company has been funded directly by Mayfest for the
first time and has been given control over its line-up.
''I'm very pleased with our own programme and Mayfest has a much more
distinctive flavour,'' he says. ''It needed some sort of upheaval and I
admire the boldness of it.''
But is there really anything distinctive about a festival that does
little more than lump together events that would largely have happened
anyway, throwing them together like a glorified ''What's On'' guide? Can
the promoters of Mary Chapin Carpenter be anything but delighted about
the free publicity and finance coming their way for a gig they would
have put on regardless?
And do the people of Glasgow really aspire to nothing more than a
festival without artistic vision or leadership, just as long as there
are a few tea dances and well kent faces? Or is there any substance to
the rumours of boardroom conflicts and of disquiet among the city's
political and artistic powerbrokers?

Tokyo, Thursday
POLICE threw a wide dragnet around Japan today to find the leaders of
a cult suspected in the deadly nerve gas attacks on Tokyo's subways,
ending weeks of cautious action.
At least 20,000 officers fanned out to search cars at roadblocks,
while the coast guard checked ships and boats leaving the country.
Police in Tokyo went on ''emergency alert'' over fears that cult
followers might launch an attack this weekend.
Last month, cult leader Shoko Asahara predicted a disaster in Tokyo
this weekend. Police patrolled the city's most crowded neighbourhoods
and its government district today in case cult members interpreted the
prediction as a sign to do damage.
According to police sources, sect followers have telephoned their
families and told them to be careful in the next few days, and there are
rumours in the sect that sarin -- the nerve gas used in the subways --
may be scattered in a Tokyo nightclub district, the Kyodo News Service
reported.
Police have arrested more than 70 cult members on a variety of
pretexts since the March 20 subway attack that killed 11 people, made
5500 ill, and stunned a nation that had thought itself free from
terrorism.
Now, however, police apparently believe they have enough evidence to
arrest most of the top figures of the Aum Shinri Kyo, or Supreme Truth,
sect.
Across the nation, police mobilised about 20,000 officers at 1000
checkpoints, according to Yomiuri, Japan's highest circulation daily.
Kyodo put the number of police at 30,000.
Police also planned raids this weekend at more than 110 cult
facilities and ''hiding places'', Kyodo said. Asahara and other top
leaders of the sect have dropped out of sight, although followers say
Asahara is still in Japan.
Police would not comment on any of the reports.
The cult denies involvement, and says the tons of chemicals seized in
weeks of raids on its facilities were for making fertiliser, not nerve
gas.
Nevertheless suspicions have focused on the sect, reinforced by daily
revelations of potentially deadly chemicals, weapons parts, and military
paraphernalia seized in raids on its property.
A senior cult member was seized today and charged with blackmailing a
businessman. News reports identified him as a former gangster and
current leader of the cult's ''commando corps'', which recaptures
escaping members and pressures believers for donations.
In addition to looking for Asahara, police were searching for another
cult leader wanted for kidnapping. Reports said bloody gauze, surgical
tools, and medical diagrams of his face were found in a bungalow,
indicating he may have had plastic surgery before fleeing.

Political Editor Geoffrey Parkhouse discusses the fast-moving career
of Gillian Shephard and her chances of leading the Tories.
SCENE: a disgruntled Tory constituency party in Hampshire. Guest
speaker -- deputy chairman Gillian Shephard. She makes her ra-ra
address, not too long. Attention stirs. The usual banality is lacking.
Speech over, she brings herself more into the body of the meeting by
popping round from behind the platform table. She hoists her skirt
(within modesty), heaves her 5ft 2in frame up to sit on the table. Kicks
off her shoes and swings her legs. ''Right,'' she says, ''let me have
it.''
She takes questions for a very long time, deploying utter candour.
When it's done they cheer her. This, they say afterwards, is the one
they want as the new party chairman. They got Jeremy Hanley instead.
Better not to ask them about that choice.
Since then this 55-year-old tyro has become Secretary of State for
Education. Before this Employment brought her into Cabinet (at the same
time as Virginia Bottomley) in 1992, then, after a year, she was moved
to Agriculture. Before that, she was Minister of State at the Treasury
and a junior at Social Security.
She was spotted by Thatcherite Peter Lilley after she arrived at the
Commons in 1987. He gave her her first step on to the ladder as his
parliamentary private secretary. Her personal views are variously cast
as right wing or centre-right. In Cabinet (which she insists should not
just be a rubber stamp), she says her piece with scant regard for
refined language.
Her colleagues have been known to wince. Planning for the European
Union summit in Corfu last year, when she was Min of Ag, she urged the
Prime Minister to go for the highest number for a majority (28) they
could get on changes to qualified majority voting (qmv). ''Get it and I
can screw them on the Common Agriculture Policy and much else besides.
Don't accept a 23 majority.''
Major and Hurd settled for 23 at Corfu. ''You've failed, haven't
you?'' she told them on their return. She hardly needed qmv, however, to
see off the then German Health Minister, Herr Seehofer, who was trying
to ban British beef.
This is a tough lady with a twinkle in her eye. Give her a chance to
laugh and she'll take it. But she wasn't laughing then. Now some talk of
her as a possible party leader, an Iron Lady Mark Two. The right wing
thinks this talk is overdone. Lady Thatcher, faced with this
possibility, is reported to have remarked: ''Oh dear, are we that
desperate?''
Ministerial colleagues on the right would favour Michael Portillo or
Jonathan Aitken before her. But the issue is hypothetical as none of the
three is thought to be ready for leadership yet. Nevertheless, as her
first big political confrontation -- with the teachers -- approaches, it
is not bad going for Mrs Shephard to be talked of in this way.
One senses that she would challenge Mr Major only if she thought
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley was going to have a go for the top
job. ''Virginia is the sexy nurse,'' she told The Times last June, ''I'm
the primary school head.'' Another Bottomley observation from her: ''She
looks so sweet, don't you think?'' Hmm. Well, how would you take that --
as a compliment?
It seems unlikely that she would be prevailed upon to ditch Major. She
is part of that East Anglian mafia, a close friend who helped organise
his leadership election. Despite this, he appeared to bring her (and
Bottomley) into Cabinet almost as an afterthought. It seems he had
overlooked the necessity to have at least one woman in the Cabinet after
he had replaced the woman in the Cabinet in 1990. He put this right in
his first reshuffle.
Her father was a cattle dealer, so she is knowledgeable about the
maladies of beasts and their transportation and welfare. From village
primary and girls high school she got to St Hilda's College, Oxford
where she sang in the Bach choir and just missed a first in modern
languages. She became a teacher, then a schools inspector. Impressed by
a large comprehensive in King's Lynn, she married the headmaster, Tom
Shephard, a widower. She has two grown-up stepsons, Mark and Neil.
Her seat, South West Norfolk, with its 16,931 Tory majority last time,
should be safe. Her home is in Northwold, near Downham Market. She is
surrounded by sugar beet, cereals, pigs and poultry, rape and linseed
oil. Hence her earthy turn of phrase (in German too) and lack of side.
Fluent in French, she lists her recreations as music, gardening, and
France. Marks and Spencer clothes are what she likes and her shoes are
sensible.
Her way into politics was a rapid rise in the Tory ranks of the county
council. She chaired education and social services committees and,
indeed a health authority. In 1986, Central Office wanted to foist a
barrister on the constituency party as an election candidate. Mrs
Shephard rebelled with the rest and finished up the candidate herself,
to her considerable surprise.
Fellow ministers have learned to look out for empire-building by her.
At Employment she persuaded the Prime Minister to give her overall
responsibility for women's matters. She also had a stab at getting
vocational training brought over from Education. Mr Gummer, Environment
Secretary, found her after a chunk of his remit. Then Agriculture
Minister, she fancied that the whole rural environment should be in her
department.
When she replaced John Patten as Education Secretary last year, the
revolt on school curricula was hardening. The first thing she did was to
call in all the teaching unions for consultation. Gradually, the issue
was defused with the teachers now prepared to work a system that they
think is feasible.
Now, teachers' pay is the issue, with even moderate unions threatening
industrial action. On Wednesday she admitted that the bargaining last
year for the education budget was ''tough''. This means that she lost
the argument with the Treasury on funding. Result: some authorities are
pruning classroom expenditure rather than bureaucracy.
She told 'em, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor Ken Clarke, at the
time that there would be trouble if they were too mean. Having just
calmed them down, why risk stirring up the teachers again? She was
distinctly uncharming about it, and is still so now that she has been
proved right.
Mrs Shephard forced a promise out of the Prime Minister that she will
get preferential treatment in this year's spending negotiations. She is
using this pledge to try to get the teachers to hold their horses. The
next marker on the Shephard career progress will be whether Mr Major
keeps his promise.
Unless, of course, the Prime Minister has moved her onwards and
upwards by then.

Moscow, Thursday
RUSSIAN human rights activists said today that Moscow's troops had
begun an aggressive campaign to mop up Chechen resistance before world
leaders meet in Moscow next month.
The activists, including former human rights commissioner Sergei
Kovalyov, charged that the world bore a share of the blame for an attack
on the town of Samashki, where they said drugged and drunken Russian
troops had run amok.
Kovalyov said the assault was clearly linked to the visit by world
leaders to Moscow on May 9 for commemorations of the Allied victory in
Europe in the Second World War.
US President Bill Clinton is due to hold a May 11 summit with Russian
leader Boris Yeltsin.
''By May 9, it must be possible to shrug one's shoulders and say 'Yes,
many things happened in Chechnya and of course we are very sorry about
that, but don't worry, the war is over','' Kovalyov said.
He said leaders assembling for the victory celebrations should be
aware that their presence constituted a tacit approval of Moscow's
actions in breakaway Chechnya.
His message was repeated in letters to Prime Minister John Major,
Clinton, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and French President Francois
Mitterand, urging them to use their visits to press their condemnations
of Russia's Chechen campaign.
The Russian Interior Ministry has denied reports that its troops
massacred civilians in Samashki.
However Western correspondents allowed in for the first time today
said they found the town's streets littered with corpses and syringes.
Civilians told ghastly stories that soldiers had murdered men, women,
and children.
Townspeople accused the Russians of looting what they could, including
carpets from the mosque, before killing or wounding men, women, and
children.
''They were all shooting up drugs. It was like they were in a
trance,'' said Fatima Zagayeva, showing a bunch of used hypodermic
needles on the ground next to her destroyed house.
In Moscow, Russian MP Anatoly Shabad also told of war crimes after
returning from a fact-finding mission to Samashky, a flashpoint of
separatist resistance 18 miles west of the capital Grozny.
He said soldiers looted and killed last weekend to avenge the death of
comrades killed by resistance fighters.
He told a news conference ''what happened there was a real massacre, a
large-scale massacre''.
He and a colleague had used a secret way into the town, beating a
cordon set up by Interior Ministry troops which had kept journalists out
until today.
Shabad, who has criticised the war from its start, said rebel troops
had left Samashky before the Russian assault but some residents, armed
with submachine guns, continued to resist and killed two or three
soldiers.
He also said many soldiers were drunk and on drugs and added: ''After
the death of the soldiers, the officers could not control their troops.
They wanted revenge.''
Hasty funerals continued today in the town cemetery, where there were
more than 100 new graves.
Some people said they had been too overwhelmed to cope with the scale
of the tragedy and the number of victims to bury their dead within 24
hours, as Muslim tradition dictates.
Some bodies were still unclaimed and others had been buried behind
homes.
''What does Yeltsin want from us?'' one mother pleaded, as friends
drove the charred remains of her daughter's corpse to the cemetery.
''Please tell the world what is going on here.''
Officers at nearby checkpoints dismissed the allegations of
atrocities.
''If you want to talk of genocide then you should talk about the
genocide of our young men,'' said a lieutenant at a roadblock 1[1/2]
miles from the town.--Reuter/AP.

A YOUTH who stabbed a ''brilliant'' student to death in the street on
Christmas Day was sent to a Young Offenders' Institution for life
yesterday.
Gary Talbot, 18, had been celebrating with friends at Strathclyde
students' union when he was confronted by shaven-headed Paul Simpson.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that in an act of mindless savagery
18-year-old Simpson plunged a kitchen knife eight inches into Mr
Talbot's body.
A jury of 10 men and five women took only 20 minutes to find Simpson
guilty unanimously of murdering the student in Cathedral Street,
Glasgow.
He also was found guilty of assaulting two other students and robbing
one of them at knifepoint the same morning.
Simpson, of Cardross Street, Dennistoun, showed no emotion as the
judge, Lord Osborne, sent him to a Young Offenders' Institution for
life.
He also was sentenced to four years on the assault and robbery charge.
As he was being led from the dock, he smiled at family and friends at
the back of the court.
During the trial, the court heard how Simpson and four friends had
been drinking in the city centre and started to walk home in the early
morning.
In John Street, they circled students John McHugh and Anthony Muldoon,
both 19, and wished them a merry Christmas.
Seconds later, Mr McHugh said someone held a knife at his neck and
another produced a large knife.
He tried to run away but the man with the large knife held on to his
shoulder and lashed out at him with the weapon.
Mr McHugh, c/o the police, said he slipped out of his jacket and the
attacker picked it up. Shortly afterwards, his jacket was found in
bushes and it had five cuts on the left side.
John Burke, l7, of Drygate, Dennistoun, Glasgow, who originally was
charged with murder, admitted assaulting Mr McHugh and punching Mr
Talbot.
He told Mr Ian Duguid, prosecuting, that he had held the knife to Mr
McHugh's throat, but said it was Simpson who ran after him slashing at
him with a kitchen knife.
Shortly afterwards, they saw Mr Talbot in Cathedral Street, and Burke
claimed the student was staggering and shouting abuse.
Burke said: ''I went over to pull him up. I punched him on the face
and walked away. Simpson then punched Mr Talbot on the side and he
collapsed.
''I didn't see anything in Simpson's hand but later he told me he had
stabbed the guy.''
Lord Osborne deferred sentence on Burke until May 4 at the High Court
in Edinburgh and continued bail.
The court heard that it took l8 minutes for an ambulance to arrive and
take Mr Talbot to the nearby Royal Infirmary.
He was admitted at 3am and it was found the knife had penetrated eight
inches, cutting through a rib, his left kidney, major blood vessels and
his liver.
Mr Talbot, an engineering student, of Carlisle Street, Springburn,
Glasgow, died at 6.45am that day.
Consultant surgeon Peter Stanton, 37, agreed with Mr Donald Findlay,
QC, defending, that in this case ''time was of the essence''.
But he told Mr Findlay that even if Mr Talbot had arrived at the
hospital 10 minutes earlier it was doubtful if his life could have been
saved.
Simpson was arrested shortly after the incident and said he and four
others were all armed with knives.
He told police he had only meant to slash the student and did not mean
to stab him.
Simpson also told police where he had thrown the kitchen knife and
they found it with Mr Talbot's blood on the blade and the accused's
fingerprint on the handle.
While in custody awaiting trial, Simpson wrote to a girl: ''I'm in
deep s..., ha ha. I'll get life when I go to court. My luck's run out.''

From PATRICK BROGAN Washington, Thursday
EATING fish will not save us from heart attacks after all, it seems.
For 10 years, the doctors have been telling us that if we eat fish, the
more the better, we will significantly reduce the dangers of keeling
over suddenly.
Now Harvard says it isn't so. The original claims, made by all the
best authorities, were based on the observation that Eskimos, who live
on fish and a little blubber, have far lower levels of heart attacks.
The Japanese, too, who eat a great deal of sushi, have fewer heart
attacks. So, the connection apparently proved, the doctors sent us all
down to the fish market -- and perhaps contributed to the destruction of
fish stocks off Canada.
Now, however, the Harvard School of Public Health has made a study of
44,895 men for six years, and found not the slightest difference in
heart disease between those who eat large quantities of fish and those
who don't.
The doctors do not recommend that everyonerevert to eating cheese
hamburgers followed by chocolate cake, but they did suggest that some
medical studies should be treated with scepticism.
Dr Alberto Ascherio, who did the work, writes: ''The belief that
eating fish helps your heart is not supported by this or other
studies.'' The same goes for fish oil products, though cod-liver oil may
serve some other purpose.

Jerusalem, Thursday
A RABBI convicted of inciting racism against Arabs was sentenced to
two years in prison and two years' probation by an Israeli court today.
Rabbi Ido Elba, a spiritual leader of Jewish extremists in the West
Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, wrote an article claiming that killing
non-Jews was sometimes a mitzvah, or good deed.
District court judge Ayala Prokatcha said she hoped the sentence would
change Elba's racist ideology from one of war to one of peace, and that
he would pass the lesson on to his followers.
Elba's article was published shortly after West Bank settler Baruch
Goldstein killed 29 Palestinians at a Hebron mosque in February 1994.
Elba wrote: ''In a war . . . It is a mitzvah to kill every gentile
from the nation that is fighting the Jew, even women and children.''
Elba was also convicted of obstructing justice and trying to obtain
ammunition.
His supporters sang in the halls as Elba left the court, maintaining
his innocence. His lawyer said he would appeal against the sentence.
SCHLESWIG: A German court sentenced four men to between two-and-a-half
and four-and-a-half years in jail for firebombing a synagogue a year ago
in the first such attack since the Nazi Third Reich.
The attack in Lubeck, in which no-one was hurt, drew worldwide
attention and thousands of Germans took to the streets in protest
against a wave of far-right violence.--AP/Reuter..

MEMBERSHIP of trades unions in Scotland has dropped by almost 7% in
the past year, according to figures released yesterday.
The figures were issued by the Scottish Trades Union Congress as it
prepared for its annual congress in Perth which begins on Monday.
It blames the drop largely on recent Government legislation on the
long-established ''check-off'' system in which members' contributions
are automatically deducted from their pay.
The new legislation obliged unions to re-sign members who wished to
continue paying their contributions in this way, and the STUC says this
requirement created administrative difficulties for unions and
employers.
According to its figures, the STUC has 49 trades unions and 27 trades
councils -- representing a total of 689,365 members -- affiliated for
the year ahead. The 689,365 figure represents an overall decrease of
50,963 or 6.9%.
Some individual unions show an increase, including the EIS, up by 742
on its previous figure of 48,629, and Equity, up by 670 on its previous
1699.
But many of the larger unions have experienced reduced memberships.
The biggest drops are: Unison, down 20,000 from its previous figure of
165,000; AEEU, down 7000 from 67,000; Usdaw, down 3727 from 36,850;
Ucatt, down 3099 from 20,000; MSF, down 2900 from 38,900; GMB, down 2770
from 90,883; and TGWU, down 2335 from 91,212.
STUC general secretary Campbell Christie yesterday said the new
legislation on check-off was largely to blame for such reductions.
In its annual report, to be submitted at Perth, the STUC's general
council claims there was ''virtually no resistance'' in principle by
members to re-signing, but says there were administrative difficulties
such as getting access to members and forms being lost.
Despite the drop in membership, the STUC is determined to keep up the
campaigning pressure on a wide range of issues during the five-day
congress.
The general council will present two reports on Towards Full
Employment, one covering Scotland in general and the other the Highlands
and Islands in particular.
Debates on the economy will include a call for a national minimum
wage, set initially at half the level of median male earnings (on latest
figures, that would mean an initial minimum pay rate of #3.70 per hour),
with a commitment to achieving a target of two-thirds.
There will be a special debate on the dispute over Rolls Royce's plan
to close the East Kilbride aero design and research centre. The 600
staff facing redundancy are scheduled to begin a series of protest
stoppages next week.
The congress will also reiterate its support for a Scottish
parliament.
Speakers will include Mr John Prescott, deputy leader of the Labour
Party, and Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson.

Kabul, Thursday
RUSSIAN jets based in Tajikistan bombed the northern Afghan town of
Taloqan and a border district today, killing a total of 125 civilians
and wounding 250.
The Afghan Foreign Ministry sent a message to the United Nations
protesting against the bombing and calling for efforts to halt the
attacks, Kabul Radio said.
The bombing on Taloqan, capital of Takhar province bordering
Tajikistan, killed 100 people and wounded 200, said the radio.
An Afghan official in Kabul added that 25 people had died and 40 were
wounded in a pre-dawn bombing raid on Takhar's northern district of Chah
Ab, near the Tajik border.
Earlier, a radio report from Taloqan quoted witnesses saying at least
six people were killed and 120 wounded by the Russian bombing.
Most casualties were civilians shopping in the bazaar, the reporter
said.
Today's bombing reports came only a day after Afghan authorities again
denied helping Tajik rebels suspected of operating from Afghan bases.
Kabul Radio said the Afghan Government was only giving humanitarian
help to Tajik refugees in the country.
Afghanistan has reported Russian bombings for the past four days in
its provinces bordering Tajikistan, where Russian-led CIS troops are
helping the government combat cross-border raids by Islamic
rebels.--Reuter.

From ARTHUR SPIEGELMAN New York, Thursday
THE American Communist Party, often portrayed as being only a
propaganda arm of the Soviet Union, is accused in a new book of
something far more sinister -- running a spy network for the Kremlin.
The book says the network, operating in the United States in the 1930s
and 1940s, penetrated the project that built the atomic bomb and such
government agencies as the State Department and the forerunner of the
Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of Strategic Services.
Based on newly discovered documents in Soviet archives, The Secret
World of American Communism says that two of the US party's veteran
leaders, Earl Browder and Eugene Dennis, assisted Soviet espionage in
the United States by recruiting spies or helping in the penetration of
government agencies.
The book, by US historians Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes and
Russian Fridrikh Firsov, also says that Moscow spent millions of dollars
supporting the party.
It says such well-known Americans as industrialist Armand Hammer and
radical journalist John Reed, author of Ten Days that Shook the World,
were used to ferry the money from Moscow to the United States for the
party.
In Reed's case, the book says that in 1919 he brought nearly #660,000
in jewels into the United States to help pay for the start-up of the
party.
Hammer, who died in 1990 after denying for years that he ever worked
for the party, laundered money for it, along with his father, in the
1930s, the book claims.
The book, published by Yale University, is the first in a series based
on newly opened Soviet files. A second volume deals with the
correspondence between Soviet leader Josef Stalin and his top aide
Vyacheslav Molotov.
Klehr said he was taken aback by the ''recklessness'' of the US
Communist Party to get involved in spying.
Haynes said: ''I am greatly surprised at the extent of the
co-operation with Soviet intelligence. I had previously thought the
party was used as a recruiting ground but did not expect to see it so
directly involved.''
While the newly discovered documents link the spy network with
penetrating the super-secret Manhattan Project that built the first
atomic bomb, both men said in separate interviews that they had not
uncovered any evidence regarding Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the US
left-wingers who were executed for stealing atomic secrets for the
Russians.
The documents were discovered in the archives of the Comintern, the
organisation responsible for foreign communist parties. They included
the papers of the US Communist Party that had been shipped to Moscow for
safekeeping.
Among the documents are ones referring to a ''Brother-Son'' network
that co-operated with Soviet agent Vasily Zubilin, who was in charge of
breaking into the Manhattan Project.
Also mentioned is a spy code-named ''Louis'' whom the authors have
identified as Morris Cohen. According to the book, he recruited an
unnamed scientist at the Manhattan Project and then acted as a courier
from Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the bomb was developed. The authors
said Cohen was alive but very ill in Moscow.
The book also corroborates parts of the testimony by former Communist
Whittaker Chambers about a spy ring that operated in Washington during
President Franklin Roosevelt's administration and obtained classified
State Department documents.
However the authors said they found no mention of Alger Hiss, the
ex-State Department official who Chambers claimed was a member of the
ring. Hiss always denied that allegation and served a prison term for
lying about whether or not he knew Chambers.--Reuter.

THE detective leading the hunt for the murderer of missing 13-year-old
schoolgirl Lindsay Rimer yesterday pledged to find the killer no matter
how long it takes.
Detective Superintendent Tony Whittle was speaking after Lindsay's
body was found weighted down in the murky waters of the Rochdale canal
near her home in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, nearly six months after
she disappeared.
Two workmen who regularly patrol the canal looking for debris found
her decomposed body after it surfaced at a spot where a dredger had been
operating two days earlier.
Lindsay, of Cambridge Street, Hebden Bridge, disappeared on the night
of November 7 after buying a packet of cornflakes at a local Spa
supermarket. Despite extensive searches of the canal, River Calder and
nearby moorland, there was no trace of her until yesterday.
Mr Whittle said it was impossible to say how long her body had been in
the water but he believed it had been dumped within minutes, or hours,
of the last sighting of Lindsay on November 7.
Mr Whittle said Lindsay's parents, Geraldine and Gordon, and the rest
of the family, were distraught.
''This is the day they dreaded. Receiving this news was worse than
their worst expectations. It was quite devastating,'' said Mr Whittle.
''They have gone through a terrible, terrible ordeal and asked to be
left with some space.''
It was likely Lindsay knew her killer, said Mr Whittle. She was a
quiet, cautious girl and was not ''streetwise''. She would be unlikely
to get into a vehicle with someone that she did not trust.
Mr Whittle said it was difficult to understand how anyone could commit
such a crime. ''Here is a young girl with all her life before her who
has gone to the shops.
''She is a straightforward, clean living girl and she has gone to the
shops to buy her own breakfast for the following day and sets off to
walk a short distance, maybe five or ten minutes to her home.
Mr Whittle, speakling at a news conference at police headquarters in
Halifax, said a post mortem examination conducted by Home Office
pathologist Michael Green had not shown the cause of death.
There were no obvious injuries to the body and no indication of a
sexual assault.
He agreed it had been a mistake not to search the stretch of canal
where the body was found, but faced with the same circumstances he would
probably make the same decision.

<RECORDNO>978895116</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE BBC was playing down the flap over Big Ears yesterday -- and
instead celebrating a multi-million pound deal to sell the Toytown
character to Japan.
It announced a deal with the Japanese network NHK, which will
introduce Noddy and Big Ears to a huge new audience.
There will be no bowing to political correctness in the land of the
rising sun, where being called big, small, or medium-size ears is no
problem.
Not so in the US, where at least one American broadcaster was reported
to be unhappy about the name of Noddy's aurally-challenged friend.
A senior children's buyer from PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service,
attending a TV sales festival in Cannes, was understood to have said Big
Ears might have to be given a less offensive name, like White Beard.
But no such handicap stood in the way of the deal with Japan.
Mr Tony Greenwood, director of BBC Children's International, a
sub-division of BBC Worldwide, said: ''Japan is the second biggest TV
and video market on earth. Noddy will be shown there early in the
summer, twice a day, for seven months.
''We haven't had to make any changes at all for the Japanese market.
People often say 'what about the cultural differences?', but there
aren't really any cultural differences between very young kids of
pre-school age.
Japan is the 26th country to be conquered by the famous Enid Blyton
characters. Next stop is the US, if the political correctness hurdle can
be crossed.
Over the following three or four months, BBC sales negotiators will
pitch Noddy and Big Ears to the US networks. But Mr Greenwood said no
talks had been held yet.
He was surprised at the fears over Big Ears, after audience research
among American parents and children showed no hint of a flap about his
name.
''We've shown Noddy to groups of parents and children in America to
see what they thought of the current series,'' said Mr Greenwood.
''Categorically absolutely none of them mentioned anything about Big
Ears. The only questions raised were things like the fact that they
don't have milkmen in America.''
BBC Worldwide, formerly BBC Enterprises, now own all the media and
publishing rights to the Noddy stories.
Noddy has already been largely reconstructed after swingeing changes
to Enid Blyton's original texts.
Homo-erotic undertones were taken out so that Big Ears and Noddy no
longer enjoy ''gay times in the woods''.
All traces of racism and sexism were stamped out when the BBC turned
Noddy into a multi-million pound cartoon series in 1992.

THE Scottish National Party's candidate in the forthcoming Perthshire
and Kinross by-election, Ms Roseanna Cunningham, yesterday accused the
Tories of using a masochistic approach to politics by delaying the
announcement on when the election will take place.
It was, she added, an insult to the electorate.
Buoyant after the results in the local elections, the Nationalists are
eagerly awaiting the fight for the seat, after the death of Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn caused the vacancy.
Party officials meeting in Perth had hoped to launch their campaign
yesterday, but said they had been thwarted by the lack of decision on a
date for the by-election.
This had caused some irritation, admitted Ms Cunningham, who added:
''For some peculiar reason, the Tories are extremely reluctant to deal
with the reality they face.
''I cannot understand the logic in putting this off further, but we
are now looking at an election date soon, possibly early June.
''The political logic escapes us all, and can only lead to the
conclusion that the Tories have absolutely no idea now what they are
doing at any level, that the complete and total disorganisation we see
at Government level is something which runs throughout the party and the
Tories in the UK.''
It was a give-away that they no longer knew what they were doing, she
said, pointing out that ''the first nail in their coffin'' had been
delivered at the Scottish local elections, and that the SNP looked
forward to delivering a second in the by-election.
''Sooner or later, the Tories are going to have to face the electorate
in Perth and Kinross, and the longer they leave it the more aggravated
that electorate is going to become,'' she warned.
The Tory candidate in the by-election is to undertake a 100-mile
sponsored walk across the constituency to raise money for charity.
With all the money going to Riding for the Disabled, Mr John Godfrey
will start his ''Perthshire Progress'' on Saturday at St Fillans on the
western edge of the constituency. He will then head eastward for five
days, reaching Invergowrie on Wednesday.
Mr Godfrey, however, denied that the sponsored walk was a cynical
attempt to try to increase his share of the poll. He said: ''The walk
was planned before we knew there was going to be a by-election. It will
be a break from politics and I will not be handing out leaflets.''
Mr Godfrey continued: ''While this kind of walk is a great way to meet
people and see the constituency, there is a more important reason for me
in raising money for this charity. My father was disabled and I came
close to it when I escaped permanent injury in a riding accident.''
Mr Godfrey said he was confident of completing his 100-mile Perthshire
trek and raising a four-figure sum.
In 1986 he walked 160 miles from Mallaig to Nairn and raised #1500 for
the Mallaig lifeboat and #1500 for the Highland Hospice in Inverness.
Last year, he covered 85 miles from Ardrossan to Helensburgh and raised
#1000 for the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow.
Day one will take Mr Godfrey from St Fillans to Crieff. Day two ends
in Dunning while day three will see him walk from Dunning to Kinross.
Day four ends in Perth with the final leg of the journey taking him to
Invergowrie.

<HEADLINE>Oil companies spend #500,000 finding out if tankers can be used to by-pass terminal.    Fears grow over future of Sullom Voe</HEADLINE>

THE long-term future of Europe's largest oil terminal at Sullom Voe in
Shetand was thrown into further doubt yesterday, with the possibility
that the Shell/Esso group could by-pass it and take oil from the East
Shetland Basin ashore by tanker.
The oil companies have awarded contracts worth about #500,000 to
confirm the feasibility of offshore loading systems to serve Brent and
other fields.
This would mean that they would no longer use the pipeline running
into Sullom Voe when the present agreements with Shetland Islands
Council expire in 2000. It presently carries oil from 13 production
platforms into the terminal.
Chevron, which operates the Ninian field and uses the second pipeline
running into the terminal, is also known to be looking at the
comparative costs of using offshore loading as opposed to the pipeline.
The terminal currently employs about 400 with a throughput of 800,000
barrels of oil a day. At peak the figure was 1.2 million barrels a day.
Talks on new agreements to operate after 2000 have been dragging on
for some time and the Shell/Esso move is a clear signal to the council
that they are serious about by-passing the terminal and want progress to
be made quickly on new agreements.
Shetland Islands Council will discuss in private today a report from
its chief executive on the possibility of reaching a new agreement for
the terminal.
Canon Lewis Shand Smith, the council convener, said yesterday that it
was hoped to report further progress towards the end of next month.
''The discussions focus on the need for a completely new relationship
between the council and the terminal, one in which partnership and trust
will be essential components,'' he said.
''I am confident that, provided the industry is willing to listen to
our proposals, the future of the terminal can be guaranteed into the
next century, including the oil by pipeline from the Brent area.''
A spokesman for Shell Expro, operator for the two companies in the
North Sea, said yesterday that no decision had been taken on future
arrangements.
''As well as confirming the feasibility of offshore loading, Shell and
Esso are also involved in discussions on the long-term future of Sullom
Voe and will continue these talks,'' said the spokesman.
''Our view remains that the long-term future of the terminal will
depend on it being cost-competitive in the face of an inevitable decline
in overall throughput.
''Although the terminal has made some progress in reducing direct
costs, to remain cost-competitive it must find ways of reducing its high
level of fixed costs, which stem mainly from current agreements with
Shetland Islands Council.''
Canon Shand Smith dismissed the claim that the high level of fixed
costs stemmed mainly from the current agreements with the council. It
was a common misunderstanding within the oil industry.
A recent undertaking by the Scottish Office to compensate the council
fully for loss of rental and/or rates income represented a significant
achievement by the council, he said.
Mr Jim Wallace, MP for Orkney and Shetland, said that while the
announcement did not come as a complete surprise it was a timely
reminder of how keenly competitive the industry was becoming as
throughput from the Brent and other fields declined.
However, he said the oil industry was being unfair in saying that the
agreements with the council were the main contributors to the high fixed
costs at the terminal.
This did not acknowledge that the setting of a uniform business rate
left the local authority with no scope to carry through its original
plan of reducing the business rate as throughput at the terminal
declined.
Mr Wallace suggested that a constructive partnership between the
industry and the council, sensibly supported by the Government, could
secure the terminal's long-term future.
''I think everyone recognises it will be a tough battle and clearly a
lot of jobs depend on it,'' said Mr Wallace.

AN OFFICER in the Boys' Brigade made off with more than #3500 after
threatening a 56-year-old woman with an air pistol in an early morning
armed robbery at a newsagents.
Paul Park, 19, was caught by police trying to hide on the roof of a
nearby derelict building shortly after the robbery in Altens, Aberdeen,
last November.
Park, of Middlefield Crescent, Aberdeen, admitted carrying out the
assault and robbery at a branch of R S McColl's while acting with
another, when he appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday.
He assaulted shop assistant Elizabeth Beattie, demanded keys for a
cupboard and safe, and robbed her of six cheques and #3564 during the
masked raid.
Lord Clyde told him: ''You have plead guilty to an offence which is of
a nature and seriousness that, in almost every case, calls immediately
for a considerable custodial sentence.''
But the judge agreed to defer sentence in Parker's case for a report
on the availability of community service and for his lawyers to consider
the question of the youth paying compensation to his victim.
The judge warned: ''I am giving no undertakings as to what the final
disposal may be.''
He added: ''You must appreciate, and I am sure you do, that the
conduct you engaged in was quite outrageous and utterly unacceptable.''
Advocate depute Michael O'Grady said the shop assistant had been
getting the small newsagents ready to open for business when the robbers
struck.
Police were called immediately and after a search in the area made
arrests and recovered the money and the weapon.
Defence counsel Jack Davidson said that Park, a first offender, had
asked him to express his apologies to the victim and his remorse to the
court.
He pointed out that there was no physical injury to the woman, but
added that it had clearly been a frightening experience.
Park, a #130-a-week fish processor, had led ''a blameless life'' prior
to this incident, added Mr Davidson.
References for Park to the court were provided by a local minister and
his officer in the Boys' Brigade. The teenager is a junior officer in
the youth organisation, said his defence counsel.
''He is highly regarded for his participation in the community and the
Boys' Brigade. It is considered that he has a useful future ahead of
him,'' said Mr Davidson as he urged the judge to consider imposing a
sentence on Park which would not result in his detention.
Lord Clyde continued the case to a later date for sentencing.

THE new convener of the City of Edinburgh Council, Mr Eric Milligan,
promised ''innovation and forward thinking'', and an international role
for the capital yesterday as regional leaders assumed the chief posts in
the new unitary authority.
In addition to the appointment of Councillor Milligan, who is convener
of Lothian Regional Council, Councillor Keith Geddes assumed the role of
ruling Labour group leader -- a position he already holds at the region.
Councillor Milligan can now expect to become Lord Provost of Edinburgh
in a year's time when the single-tier council takes over full control
from the regional and district authorities.
In an inaugural speech at the first meeting of the new ''shadow''
authority, he listed the key qualities which he believed should underpin
everything the new council did.
They were ''partnership with others, openness towards all, innovation
and forward thinking, an intention to fulfil the city's international
potential and an abiding commitment to equality.''
Councillor Milligan insisted that the new authority was not Lothian
region or Edinburgh District Council in an amended form.
It was a new council, he said, ready to draw on the best practice of
them both and intent on becoming the model authority in style and
substance.
Opposition Tory group leader Councillor Daphne Sleigh claimed the
electorate had ignored local issues and been keen to give an unpopular
Government ''a deserved bloody nose''.
The leader of the 10-strong Liberal Democrat group, Councillor Donald
Gorrie, said it would fight its corner, but would also be as
constructive as possible.
Councillor Margaret McGregor, who chairs the district council's
Licensing Board, was confirmed as vice convener of the new council.
District Council leader Lesley Hinds will be deputy leader of the
administration.

Denton, Thursday
FILM giant Arnold Schwarzenegger has been named in a paternity suit
filed on behalf of a Texas woman who claims the bodybuilder-turned-actor
is the father of her 12-year-old daughter.
Debra Wrenn, 41, in a suit filed in county court in Denton, Texas,
said she had notified Schwarzenegger in November that he was the father
of her daughter, Christina Lynn Bentlage.
In a letter to Schwarzenegger included among court papers, Wrenn said
the lawsuit was filed because her daughter has been diagnosed with a
bone cyst that requires a biopsy and possible bone graft, which she
cannot afford.
''My honest intent is not to create any disruption in your life,
marriage, or career,'' Wrenn wrote. ''I pray that you take this to heart
because, Arnold, she really needs you.''
Schwarzenegger's lawyer Howard Weitzman said the actor had never met
Wrenn, and was not in Indianapolis when Wrenn said the two met at a
nightclub called the Naughty Lady.
''The allegation that Arnold Schwarzenegger fathered a child with an
individual named Debra Wrenn is totally false,'' Weitzman said.
Schwarzenegger, the star of such action movies as True Lies, married
television journalist and Kennedy family member Maria Shriver in 1986.
They have two daughters.
Wrenn in the lawsuit said her daughter and the Austrian-born
Schwarzenegger shared similar features, including a cow's lick,
turned-in big toes, and a large dimple on the base of their
tailbones.--Reuter.

THE Kirk is to be urged to have talks on union with the Scottish
Episcopal Church, despite the Church of Scotland's historical opposition
to the rule of bishops.
In a report to the General Assembly, the committee on ecumenical
affairs says that an invitation from the Episcopal Church should be
accepted ''to see where the Spirit leads''.
The Episcopalians have issued the invitation through the talks in
which they, the Kirk, the United Free, Methodist, Congregational, and
United Reformed churches have been engaged since the 1960s with a view
to forming a united Scottish church.
The committee says it recognises the reservations within the Church of
Scotland in relation to the historic episcopate.
''It also considers that every opportunity should be taken to further
ecumenical relations. It believes that the issues which divide the
churches need to be looked at again and again.
''And so, building on what we hold in common and facing up to what
divides us, the committee recommends acceptance of the invitation in
order to see where the Spirit leads.''
The report says that a statement by the Scottish Episcopal Church at
its synod last year reflected a shift away from the traditional
understanding of the historic episcopate through an unbroken line of
bishops. Continuity in faith belonged to the life of the church as a
whole.
The Episcopalians were willing to consider the possibility of bishops
serving for a limited period, such as seven years.
They believed times had changed. There was already mutual recognition
of ministries in local ecumenical projects.
''The question is whether the Church of Scotland is prepared to think
likewise,'' says the report.
The Rev Sheilagh Kesting, secretary to the committee, said yesterday
there was opposition to bishops in the Church of Scotland but this was
more an emotional reaction.
The multilateral conversations had shown that doctrinal differences
were no longer enough to justify being separate.
The Rev Richard Holloway, Bishop of Edinburgh and Primus of the
Scottish Episcopal Church, said last night: ''We ought to admit that
Christ's idea for the church was it should be one and not a kind of
supermarket religion.''
He understood the nervousness people had about episcopacy, but
ministry had evolved, and the Episcopal Church was now governed by
synods, of which bishops were a part.

MOVES to exclude councillors from Coatbridge were a significant factor
in Labour group elections at the new North Lanarkshire ''shadow''
authority which combines Motherwell, Monklands and Cumbernauld and
Kilsyth.
Controversial Monklands leader James Brooks consequently failed in a
bid for the deputy leadership, losing to Motherwell district's James
McCabe by 36 votes to 13.
While no-one quite said it, there appeared to be a resolve that the
Monklands factor should not taint the new authority in its formative
days.
There was disappointment for two of the best-known names in Scottish
local government, Cosla president Rosemary McKenna and her predecessor
Charles Gray, former Labour leader of Strathclyde region.
Both contested the leadership, which fell to Motherwell district's
Harry McGuigan, but had to be content with places on the executive.
Convener of the new council is the current Motherwell district council
group leader, Councillor Vincent Mathieson, while vice-convener is
Cumbernauld regional councillor Barry McCulloch.
Another Motherwell district councillor, Mr John Moran, was elected
group secretary.
The only Monklands councillor to achieve a position was Mr John Logue,
who becomes chief whip. However, he represents an Airdrie ward and is
one of the Labour rebels who has consistently criticised the activities
of his political colleagues in Coatbridge.
Professor Robert Black's independent report into allegations of
nepotism and religious bias in Monklands District Council is expected to
be published in the next few weeks.
Meanwhile, Labour councillors in Glasgow emerged from the heat of
their factional warfare yesterday trying to grapple with the novel
situation of having peace, or at least a ceasefire, imposed on them.
The factions were busily analysing Wednesday's Labour group elections,
which saw the controversial district council Labour leader Councillor
Patrick Lally lose out by 39-37 to his long-time political enemy
Councillor Jean McFadden, for the convenership of the new Glasgow
single-tier authority during its ''shadow'' year until next April.
There was grudging acceptance that a peace-keeping force led by
Councillor Robert Gould, Labour leader on Strathclyde region, could well
bring stability to the City Chambers. Mr Gould was elected unopposed as
group leader and was able, largely with the backing of Lally supporters,
to set out his own agenda of neutralising the rival factions.
Ironically, he could not deliver Mr Lally's desired victory.
Lally supporters had been shocked by their leader's defeat, but this
moderated to modest satisfaction yesterday when it emerged that the
faction was still in a strong position.
The defeated Mr Lally could still be in the frame for the Lord
Provostship when the new councill assumes full powers next April. He
lost by just two votes and could well recover his position.

A MURDER hunt was launched yesterday after the body of a 45-year-old
man was found by firefighters called to tackle a blaze in a block of
flats in Leith.
Detectives are treating the death of former miner Mr Robert Blewes as
suspicious because of injuries found on his body which were inconsistent
with the fire at his top-floor flat at Portland Place.
Firefighters who went there around 8.30pm on Wednesday found the
burned body of Mr Blewes, a familiar character in the area where he had
lived for 15 years.
Police are anxious to trace anyone who was in the area of Portland
Place and North Junction Street between 6pm and 8.30pm, especially
people who were in the Vine Bar between those times.
Mr Blewes is known to have been at the Vine Bar, one of several public
houses he frequented in the area, until about 7pm, and detectives are
keen to trace his movements after that.
Neighbours tried to get into the flat when the fire broke out but were
beaten back by smoke and flames.
Detective Superintendent Douglas Evans said they were keen to
determine the cause of the fire which did not appear to have been
started by an electrical fault.
Mr Blewes, who was divorced and had three grown-up children, had lived
alone for some time, originally came from the Mayfield area in
Midlothian.
Neighbours described him as ''a gentle giant'' who enjoyed a drink,
football, and betting.

BRITAIN's champion car -- the Ford Escort -- was placed bottom of the
league yesterday in a major car satisfaction survey of UK motorists.
Other UK-produced cars fared badly with Japanese models claiming most
of the top places in the survey from American marketing information
company JD Power and Associates.
Average satisfaction level for individual models was 77%. But many UK
cars came below this figure with the Escort coming last of the 70
K-registration cars surveyed with 64%.
Of the Escort, the survey said: ''It performed at the lowest level in
every measured area of vehicle and dealer-related performance except
service costs.''
The Escort has been the top-selling car in Britain for 11 of the past
13 years. It was second-highest seller behind the Ford Fiesta in 1990
and 1991.
But a Ford spokesman said: ''The JD Power survey does not give a true
picture because it represents only a comparatively small number of
owners.
''We speak to all our customers and we have had a 94% satisfaction
level on our Escorts -- 1% up on last year.''
There was further bad news British manufacturers in the survey of more
than 39,000 owners. Of 70 models surveyed, no British car came in the
top 20.
Highest-placed UK car was the Jaguar XJ6 which was in equal 21st place
with an 83% satisfaction level.
Other British models on or above the 77% average were: Rover 200
(82%), Rover 400 (81%), Rover Maestro (78%), Vauxhall Nova (78%) and
Rover Metro (77%).
But large numbers of UK models came below the 77% average with the
bottom four places occupied by Rover Mini (69%), Ford Orion (67%),
Vauxhall Frontera (67%) and Ford Escort (64%).
Top of the league, with a 96%, was the Toyota Corolla, which, from the
late 1990s, will be produced at Toyota's Burnaston plant in Derbyshire
with the creation of 1,000 new jobs.
The survey also looked at customer satisfaction with car companies as
opposed to individual models and again UK companies fared poorly with
the Japanese out on top.
Toyota completed a notable double by being the most popular of the 30
companies listed.
Seven of the league's top 10 positions were occupied by Japanese
companies with Jaguar the highest placed British firm in 15th place.
Ford was as low as 29th in the table while Rover Cars came 18th,
Peugeot Talbot 21st, Vauxhall 25th and Land-Rover 27th.
Now in its second year, the survey dealt with all aspects of new car
ownership from product quality to dealer service. Those who took part
had to answer 35 questions in six separate categories.
JD Power found that 63% of UK owners were ''satisfied'' with their car
-- the same number as last year. The number who were ''very satisfied''
fell 1% to 56%.
A total of 41% of owners were ''very satisfied'' with their franchised
dealer against 39% last year.
Top 10 cars in the satisfaction survey were: Toyota Corolla; Honda
Civic; Mitsubishi Colt; Mazda 323; Proton; Toyota Carina E; Toyota MR2;
Honda Accord; Honda Concerto Mazda 626.

Canberra, Friday
A COMMONER has taken the royal prerogative into his own hands -- and
beheaded the Queen.
A controversial nude statue of Her Majesty was decapitated overnight,
but the nude Duke of Edinburgh seated beside her on a lakeside park
bench in Canberra was left intact.
Conservative anti-republicans have denounced the life-sized statues,
which have been sitting at the side of Lake Burley Griffin since the
start of the week, as thoroughly tactless and demeaning to the head of
state.
Their group, Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, described the
work, entitled Liz and Phil by the Lake, as offensive, puerile, and
motivated by politics rather than art.
''The Queen is the head of state. This is her national capital and
they put a sculpture of her to hold her up to ridicule,'' said spokesman
Alan Fitzgerald.
Sculptor Greg Taylor said the statues symbolised the irrelevance of
the Queen and and her husbands for Australians who want a republic.
Prime Minister Paul Keating plans to replace the monarch with an
Australian president by 2001.
Local government officials, who authorised the display as part of a
city-wide sculpture exhibition, say most people approve.
However monarchists want the rusting ferro-concrete sculpture,
depicting the Queen naked except for a tiara, removed at once.
''It's just a continuation of the Brit-bashing which seems to be part
of the republicans' agenda,'' Fitzgerald added.
The royalist group's national spokeswoman, Kerry Jones, said: ''It's
an absolutely outrageous and disrespectful act.''
The sculpture is due to be removed at the end of this
month.--Reuter/AP.

A LABOUR council leader yesterday called on the Government to allow
new town tenants to transfer automatically to local district councils as
the five development corporations are wound up.
Catherine Craigie of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District Council claimed
it was ''a national scandal'' that time and public money was being
wasted on trying to persuade these 31,000 tenants to vote for new
landlords other than their local council.
Councillor Craigie, who chairs Slant (Scottish Local Authorities with
New Towns), referred to a recent vote in Glenrothes in which 85% of
tenants said they wanted Kirkcaldy District Council as the successor
landlord to the development corporation when it is wound up later this
year.
She said there was more than enough evidence to suggest that tenants
in the remaining four towns of Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Irvine, and
Livingston also wanted their local councils to take over as landlords.
A survey by the Scottish Office in 1989 had shown the district council
was the first choice of new landlord for 64% of the tenants.
In later local surveys higher percentages of tenants had shown a
preference for the council. In her own area of Cumbernauld, for
instance, as many as 92% of tenants had said they would vote for the
council in a ballot.
A Scottish Office spokesman said the Secretary of State believed it
was proper to give tenants an opportunity to choose a successor
landlord. There was no guarantee that the results from the other new
town ballots would reflect those of Glenrothes.

POLICE have arrested and questioned a member of staff at Windsor
Castle about a suspicious fire at the royal residence, it was revealed
last night.
The 34-year-old man was detained and quizzed at Windsor police station
about a fire at the castle earlier this month, Scotland Yard said.
''We are investigating a small fire that occurred at the castle in the
early hours of April 3,'' said a Yard spokesman.
''In connection with that inquiry we arrested a 34-year-old man,'' he
added.
Scotland Yard refused to confirm a report in the Sun that the suspect,
who was released without charge on police bail until May 11, was a
member of the castle's fire brigade.
The man was interviewed by officers from the International and
Organised Crime branch about a fire alleged to have been started near
the staff dining room.
The police inquiry follows three suspicious blazes in the last six
months.
Scotland Yard detectives, who are responsible for police matters
within the walls of the palace, stepped up their inquiries on April 3
this year when rubbish was set fire alongside the staff dining rooms.
The blaze was put out within two minutes of being found and members of
the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service were not called in.
Two other blazes in the castle area are being investigated by the
Serious Crime Squad.

DETECTIVES were yesterday testing the theory of a connection between
the missing wife of a dead property owner and the body of a woman found
in a country lane.
Wealthy Martin Link, 49, is believed to have poisoned himself at his
Birmingham home on Sunday, leaving a note saying: ''Something terrible
has happened.''
The body in the lane was said to closely resemble his 53-year-old wife
Alena, who had disappeared two weeks previously.
A farm worker at Middleton on the Wolds, Humberside, found her body
eight days ago and a post-mortem examination revealed that the woman had
been savagely beaten on the head with a blunt object.
Police would not confirm that the body was that of Mrs Link but a
spokesman said: ''I can confirm that we have been in contact with West
Midlands police regarding a possible identification of the body.''
Earlier, a spokesman from the same force said detectives believed
police were being taunted by the killer, who left the woman wrapped in a
bedspread shroud, making no attempt to conceal the body.
At the opening of the inquest into Mr Link's death yesterday,
Birmingham coroner Dr Richard Whittington said that notes had been found
at Link's home which gave him ''cause for concern''.
The content of the notes was not revealed during the hearing but one,
addressed to his father Harry, is understood to begin: ''Something
terrible has happened. I expect you'll know soon enough.''
No cause of death was given at the hearing because further tests have
to be carried out, but a coroner's office spokesman said it appeared
that Mr Link had taken a combination of drugs.

A DIRECTOR at Glasgow's troubled East Park Home for severely
handicapped children is considering resignation over a boardroom
dispute.
Ms Neelam Bakshi said she had been kept in the dark over recent
developments at the home. The board did not consult her over the sacking
of the former matron, Mrs Eleanor ''Lynn'' McCreadie, or the appointment
of the new general manager, Mrs May Henderson.
Ms Bakshi has also still not received details of a board meeting held
earlier this week.
Ms Bakshi, regional councillor for Maryhill Summerston and an East
Park director for four years, admitted that she did not attend as many
board meetings as she would like because of the pressures of council
work. But she said the other members still had a duty to inform her of
developments and decisions.
She said: ''I was not consulted over recent events and, despite three
attempts to obtain information, the general manager has failed to return
any of my inquries. I specifically asked for information on the board
meeting this week and have still not had an answer.
''I am disappointed that they have not passed on information on such a
serious matter.
''If this is not resolved I will have to consider my position on the
board. If I am not provided with the relevant information I cannot
fulfil my duties as a board member.''
Ms Bakshi, who is the region's representative on the board, has had
advice from council lawyers. She hopes to force the board to provide her
with the appropriate information.
The chairman of the board, Mrs Paddy Burnett, said she was surprised
at Ms Bakshi's comments and claimed the matter was ''being dealt with
very quickly''.
Mrs Burnett said: ''She is an intelligent and knowledgeable member of
the board and I hope it won't come to her leaving.''
She added that Ms Bakshi was busy with council work but was always
provided with minutes of meetings.
Mrs Burnett also spoke to The Herald for the first time about the
controversial sacking of Mrs McCreadie last month.
Mrs McCreadie, 55, was dismissed for no apparent reason after being
summoned to a meeting with senior members of the board of directors. The
former administrator, Mrs Henderson, was appointed the new head of the
home. But last week it was reported that she is involved in a
relationship with the man who carried out a staff review at the time, Dr
Kenneth McAlpine.
Mrs Burnett refused to go into detail about the incident but said the
dismissal had nothing to do with malpractice and the staff review had
been held to modernise practices.
She said she ''felt sorry'' for Mrs Henderson and Dr McAlpine over the
media attention they had received.
Mrs Burnett added that Dr McAlpine was only one of four people who
carried out the staff review.
She said: ''Dr McAlpine is very competent and gave up a lot of his
time. There was no favouritism and I am very vexed that it got to
personal level.''
She said Tuesday's board meeting was ''business as usual''.

THE last inland paddle steamer built in Britain moved a stage nearer
an assured future yesterday with the presentation of a #75,000 cheque.
The money was handed over to the newly-formed Maid of the Loch Trust
by Provost Pat O'Neill, of Dumbarton District Council.
The council, which owns the paddle steamer, intends transferring
ownership of the Maid of the Loch to the trust once it has attracted
funding of #200,000.
Accepting the cheque for the trust, Mr Michael Hughan, of the Paddle
Steamer Preservation Society, said: ''I am delighted to be part of the
trust and I look forward with a great deal of hope to seeing the Maid
sail on Loch Lomond again.''
Provost O'Neil said: ''It is vital that we grasp the opportunity to
create the kind of world class tourist attraction Loch Lomond deserves.
''The creation of a trust is the best way forward for attracting the
money needed to ensure that the Maid sails again.''
The council bought the Maid, her sister ship the Countess Fiona, the
pier and surrounding land at Balloch in December 1992.

<TEXT>
OFFICERS in around a quarter of the 43 police forces in England and
Wales are to test CS sprays on patrol, Home Secretary Michael Howard
announced yesterday.
Ten forces will try out the sprays, which cause watering eyes,
sneezing, and coughing. They will be chosen by the Association of Chief
Police Officers.
The move was welcomed by the Police Federation which said it had been
calling for several years for incapacitant sprays to be evaluated in an
effort to reduce the 18,000 assaults on officers each year.
Chairman Fred Broughton said: ''The use of the spray will enable
officers to restrain violent criminals without resorting to the use of
batons or firearms.''
Mr Howard announced the trial on a visit to a Neighbourwood Watch
scheme in Exeter. ''Anything which helps protect police officers from
the violence they face on behalf of the public must be looked at,'' he
said.
''I support street trials of the sprays to ensure they are suitable
for the job they are designed to do -- that is incapacitate the
assailant.''
Trials will include routine carrying of CS aerosol canisters for
self-defence, not for dealing with disorders.
The sprays will only be used where an officer reasonably believes he
or she will be assaulted, said the Home Office.
The symptoms would normally subside quickly with movement of air but
any serious discomfort could be alleviated by washing the victim's face
with water, said a spokesman.
ACPO said 16 forces had offered to try out the sprays, but no decision
on which would carry the sprays would be made before next month.
Mr Howard later indicated that Avon and Somerset police was likely to
be one of the forces to try out the new spray weapon.
He was visiting a police station at Clevedon near Bristol to learn of
a police initiative in which parents are called out at night to help
control their youngsters.
The trials will be watched by chief constables in Scotland although
there are no plans for tests here.

HIGHLAND Regional councillors yesterday gave the go-ahead for legal
action aimed at stopping the axe falling on Fort William-London sleeper
and Motorail services on May 28.
The Court of Session challenge will be lodged within a fortnight, the
timing and contents subject only to further advice from senior counsel
early next week.
The council, acting in its capacity as a relevant transport authority,
will argue that next month's service losses should not be allowed
because a formal consultation process will not have been concluded by
then.
Pressure on British Rail to rethink the withdrawals increased earlier
this week when Rail Regulator John Swift insisted they must not occur
until the consultation process, scheduled throughout the summer, was
completed.
However, Mr Swift also claimed he had no statutory powers to require
BR to maintain the Fort William-Euston sleepers or the Motorail from
Inverness and Fort William which ScotRail have removed from timetables
after May 27.
BR later promised to retain the assets to ensure the services could be
reinstated if Rail Franchising Director Roger Salmon decided to include
them in ScotRail's passenger service requirement.
But Highland councillors, worried at the social and economic impact
caused by the service losses, have now taken matters into their own
hands -- a decision applauded by Labour's Shadow transport spokesman, Mr
Henry McLeish.
However, the MP questioned why council tax payers should foot the bill
to save services that Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney or Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang could protect at a stroke of the financial pen. He
added: ''The Government's rail privatisation policies are fast becoming
farcical.''
Highland region convener Mr Duncan McPherson said the council was
forced to take legal action because the Government had not listened to
representations backed by the community, MPs, and others.
He added: ''At this stage, I would not wish to reveal our hand, but
our aim is to secure the continued operation of the Motorail service and
the Fort William-London sleeper beyond May 28, pending formal
consultation on future services.''
When pressed, he suggested the Court of Session petition could be
lodged by the end of next week, but advance warning will not be given in
case ScotRail or British Rail tried to take preventative measures.
Councillor Jimmy Fry, finance committee vice-chairman, said it was
frustrating that the only way to make the Government listen was to take
legal action. If necessary, the council will ''even go as far as the
European courts''.
Before the announcement, members of the roads and transport committee
expressed disgust that ScotRail plans to withdraw eight Saturday
overnight services linking Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness
with London during the peak tourist season.
They also protested at the loss of steam trains between Fort William
and Mallaig; the replacement of loco-hauled summer trains with Sprinters
on Glasgow-Fort William and other routes; and cuts in the Inverness-Wick
services.
Last night, Mr McLeish insisted that up to 21 ScotRail employees were
threatened with redundancy at Fort William from May 28. He said that
made a mockery of the consultation period or suggestions that ''assets''
will be preserved.
The MP added: ''If ScotRail thought consultation was likely to save
the services, they would not be spending money on redundancies only to
have to rehire people later.''
He hoped the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities would back
Highland region's ''historic decision to fight the devastation of
services''.
ScotRail declined to comment on the threat of legal action.

HISTORIC Scotland said yesterday that it had been fully consulted and
was not overly concerned with the end result of extensive renovations to
Balnagown Castle, Easter Ross, a building quickly labelled by locals as
the pink palace.
For the past year the building, owned since 1972 by Mr Mohamet Fayed
of Harrods fame, has been under tarpaulin and the latest phase of
repairs is believed to have cost a #1m.
Over the years #20m is rumoured to have been spent.
The 600-year-old castle, once the seat of the earls of Ross, lies in
secluded grounds but can be seen from the A9. Now that the wraps are off
it has a decidedly pinkish-red hue, especially on its dual turreted west
face.
An official of Historic Scotland said the organisation had been fully
aware from proposal stage of the colour of harling to the building.
''We were fully consulted and are satisfied that it is appropriate to
the historical integrity of the building,'' she said.
''Historically, harling often was brightly coloured on Scottish
buildings. Culross Palace, for example, has ochre harling which is its
original colour.''
Such renovations would be inspected only if a building was subject to
grant assistance, and Balnagown Castle did not come into this category.
Nevertheless, because of the comment caused locally, Historic Scotland
was looking into the case, she said.

As a leaflet on care in homes is launched, the truth begins to emerge
about a disgraceful episode David Steele reports
THE tragic death of Daniel Lowe touched the people of his home town of
Stranraer who remembered the eccentric general trader who had left to
spend his final years in the comfort of a retirement home in nearby
Wigtown.
Yesterday, however, the mood of his close relatives turned to anger
and disgust when it was disclosed that two of his carers had lied about
their part in his last hours.
It will be an anger shared in judicial circles as they take stock of
the implications of a case in which two witnesses lied during an inquiry
designed to examine the facts of his death and make any recommendations
to prevent a recurrence.
As one senior legal figure put it: ''People cannot think for one
moment they can get to their feet in a court and tell any story they
like.''
Mr Lowe had been suffering from senile dementia and Parkinson's
disease when, after a spell in the Crichton Royal Hospital in Dumfries,
he had been accepted by the Thorley family at Hillcrest retirement home.
They specialised in providing residential care for the elderly with
the emphasis on avoiding an institutional atmosphere which curtailed
residents' movements.
Last August the fatal accident inquiry at Stranraer heard that Mr Lowe
had adapted to a reasonably settled regime but that he remained dressed
at all times and often wandered off for periods of time.
A system of noting his absences and going out to persuade him to
return if he was gone too long was set up and sometimes police returned
Mr Lowe to the home.
He was regarded by locals as something of a character and they would
assist in his safe return. Then on February 6 last year the system broke
down with tragic results.
Marie Blackley told the inquiry that she had regularly checked on Mr
Lowe but that late at night she found a fire door open and the old man
missing from his room. She went on to claim that she saw Mr Lowe
leaving, and awakened Robert Thorley, who was in the home, who was out
searching for Mr Lowe within a few minutes.
It now transpires that he was with his girlfriend, whom he has since
married, at a house in nearby Seaview and there was a delay in alerting
him. Both were praised by Sheriff James Smith for acting promptly.
The night was cold with sleet showers and there was no sign of Mr Lowe
until the late morning when a police dog picked up his scent. He had
fallen 12ft on to a golf course, suffering broken ribs and spinal
injuries but managed to walk or crawl 100 yards before dying in a ditch.
The wall over which Mr Lowe fell, the fence part of which had been
damaged by vandalism and wear and tear, has since been repaired by
Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council.
Sheriff Smith, having listened to a variety of witnesses including the
perjured evidence of Blackley and Thorley, was of the opinion that no
precaution which could have reasonably been taken by the proprietors of
Hillcrest, or the nursing staff, could have prevented the occurrence and
that as Blackley had seen Mr Lowe leaving the search was instituted
quickly.
He went on to say that the accident may already have happened when
Robert Thorley began his search and that an additional member of staff
may have made no difference.
His determination was that Daniel Daily Lowe died of chest and spinal
injuriies resulting from a fall at Wigtown and Bladnoch Golf Club in the
early hours of February 7.
He additionally determined that no reasonable precautions, others than
those already taken, could have been taken to avoid the death; that no
defect in a system of working contributed to the death; and that no
facts other those found were relevant.
Sheriff Smith called the death ''a sad little tragedy'' and said that
more enlightened times had allowed Mr Lowe to be allowed his freedom
despite his eccentricity. He went on to praise the Thorley family for
taking him in and added: ''I am of the opinion that nobody can be blamed
for what happened.''
He called for fire door alarms to be fitted to warn staff and it is
understood that these are now in place at Hillcrest in common with other
such homes.
The sheriff's words, based as they were on false evidence, rang hollow
for Daniel Lowe's family yesterday.
Niece Agnes Palmer said: ''I had been trying for some time to get Dan
away from the home as I was not convinced he was doing well and the
family wanted him closer. It is sad now to think back to the sheriff's
words when in fact the circumstances were very different.
''I feel now there should be a fresh inquiry so that the story can be
told properly. There is no point in suing anyone as that will not bring
Dan back to us. He deserved better than that and I hope the people who
did this are dealt with very severely.''
His brother Eric added: ''We have been let down and perhaps the true
story of how Dan died that night will never be known.''

AN MP last night called for a public inquiry ''with teeth'' to look
into growing public concern over care homes in Scotland.
Dunfermline West MP Rachel Squire made her comments after the launch
of a Scottish Office information leaflet on the subject.
Health Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie said the publication provided
important information for people considering entering residential or
nursing homes.
However, Mrs Squire said the leaflet, although important, was not
enough and a full Government-backed public inquiry should be launched to
debate the issue.
Mrs Squire, Labour's community care spokeswoman, said: ''The issue of
care homes is a very emotive one. There is great concern in Scotland on
this subject at the moment.
''I want Lord Fraser to ensure there is a wide-scale public debate on
the subject of private residential homes and the care they provide,
particularly for the frail and elderly.
''There is also concern in Scotland about the removal of the NHS
provision of long-term nursing for frail, old people and its replacement
by the private means tested sector.''
She added: ''Obviously there is also concern about the standards of
care in some of these private nursing and residential homes.
''We need the standards, registration scheme, and inspection system
for nursing homes tightened up.
''A public inquiry is needed and one seen by the public as to have
some teeth.''
Under the Government's community care policy people assessed as
needing residential or nursing home care have the right to choose the
home in which they will live.
Lord Fraser said the booklet also explains the rules relating to
people's contributions towards the cost of this type of care.
He added: ''This leaflet will assist people to make effective and
informed choices about where they or their relatives will live.''
Publicly the Scottish Office says the booklet was introduced because
of a need for better public information on the arrangements for entering
a care home.
However, New St Andrew's House sources admit that they are concerned
over a number of reports alleging bad standards of care at some homes
and wanted the public to be clear of their rights before entering them.

THOUSANDS of historic ships quietly rotting away in Britain's rivers,
coves and docks are to be recorded for posterity.
Experts at St Andrews University are to compile a national register of
ships built before 1945 which are lying in British waters, many of them
half-forgotten hulks.
Vessels of more than 40ft, from dredgers and Clyde ''Puffers'' to
Second World War destroyers and 19th-century sailing ships will be
listed so that as many as possible can be preserved and protected.
It could lead to exciting new projects similar to the preservation of
Captain Scott's Discovery at Dundee, Nelson's Victory, the Cutty Sark
and the Carrick, the former RNVR HQ on the Clyde that sank twice before
being rescued and taken to the Scottish Maritime Museum at Irvine.
The work will be carried out by the Scottish Institute of Maritime
Studies at the university, whose archeological diving unit already
advises the Government on historic wrecks needing protection.
The institute's director, Dr Robert Prescott, said Britain's maritime
heritage was second to none.
''It is astonishing that we just don't know how many of our historic
vessels there are -- there could be anything from 500 to 5000,'' said Dr
Prescott.

A DOCTOR at Law Hospital, Lanarkshire, yesterday persuaded the
hunger-striking murderer, Thomas Campbell, to accept treatment, which
will include taking nourishment.
Campbell, 42, serving a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years for
the Ice Cream Wars murders, has not eaten prison food since January 10.
He was transferred from the hospital at Shotts Prison, where he has been
held since January after the Barlinnie Special Unit was closed, at about
midnight on Wednesday.
Campbell, originally a heavily-built, 13-stone ''hard man'', has lost
more than three stones in recent weeks and was obviously in such a poor
condition that his move had become a matter close to emergency.
Law Hospital yesterday said that Campbell's condition was fair and
stable. He had been drinking tea and had been put on an intravenous drip
to combat dehydration.
The possibility will have to be faced that, when Campbell is returned
to prison, the cycle of refusal could begin all over again.
After speaking to him yesterday, his wife Elizabeth said: ''I took in
Complan and sandwiches and Tommy took a mug of liquid food and ate half
a sandwich. He looks terrible, with what looks like two black eyes
because of starving, but that was some kind of progress.
''I am hoping now that, when he goes back to prison, some kind of
compromise can be worked out with the prison authorities to allow us to
continue supplying him with food. Otherwise we will be back to square
one. I have no idea what would happen then.''
Mrs Campbell hopes to take her three children into Law Hospital to see
their father at the weekend.
The Scottish Prison Service is in a cleft stick, forced to play host
to Campbell, but also forced to abide by the revised prison rules which
removed the right of any prisoner to have food brought in from outside.
The relaxed regime at Barlinnie Special Unit allowed Campbell
considerable latitude in this respect, and also facilitated his
campaigns to fight his conviction. The SPS, however, is maintaining that
its role is clear -- to hold Campbell in custody.
Campbell's refusal to eat prison food has followed years of claims
that his conviction 10 years ago for the murders of six members of a
Glasgow family in an extended war over ice-cream van territories was the
direct result of fabricated evidence.
The Crown investigated claims by the key witness at the trial --
William Love -- that he was coerced by police to lie on oath, but
refused to prosecute him for perjury for want of ''reliable'' witnesses.
To have accepted Love's protestations that he perjured himself would
have meant freeing Campbell and his co-accused, Joseph Steel, since the
trial judge told the High Court jury at the time that it could not
convict without accepting Love's evidence.
Campbell has been on hunger strike in Shotts Prison on a previous
occasion, again protesting his wrongful conviction. His lawyer, Mr John
Carroll, believes that Campbell may now have a medical condition which
makes it very difficult for his body to accept food.
The move to Law Hospital may have come just in time. Mr Douglas
Skelton, author of the book, Frightener, which is based on the Ice-cream
Wars, and a campaigner for Campbell and Steel, yesterday told The Herald
that a phone call from Campbell in prison earlier this week had been cut
short when Campbell had been forced to drop the phone and had slumped to
the floor through weakness.
The SPS maintains that the question of force-feeding in a case such as
Campbell's does not arise. It operates on the basis of policy formulated
by the British Medical Association so there would be no attempt to force
feed if a doctor in charge of the hunger striker was satisfied that the
prisoner had been rational when he took the decision to refuse
nourishment and was aware of the consequences.

ROLLS-ROYCE has withdrawn the offer of enhanced redundancy payments to
staff at its closure-threatened East Kilbride plant.
Unions had been warned that the special terms -- worth up to #10,000
-- would not be available if a strike went ahead.
Management admitted last night that the terms were no longer on the
table and would not be reinstated until a notice of industrial action
was lifted.
Works' convener Graham Irvine said: ''It shows how bitter management
has become.
''The payments should still be on offer until the strike takes place
and then withdrawn only from those taking part in the industrial
action.''
The 600 staff voted on Monday to strike next week in an attempt to
save their jobs and stop the transfer of work to Derby and Bristol.
A company spokesman admitted last night: ''The offer of enhanced
severance terms has been withdrawn following notice of industrial
action.''
They would return if the strike threat were lifted.
Ironically, Rolls-Royce earlier yesterday issued a statement which
said that more than 100 people had been offered -- and accepted --
enhanced severance terms since the closure announcement in January.
The board was criticised by MPs earlier this week for taking salary
rises of 27% when staff are fighting to save their jobs.
Then unions at other Rolls-Royce plants resolved to ban work on any
contracts transferred from East Kilbride when industrial action starts
to hit tight schedules on contracts.
An overtime ban begins on Tuesday, followed by an all-out 36-hour
stoppage, with a two-day strike the following week under a rolling
programme.

URGENT action to halt a drop in male fertility apparently resulting
from chemical exposure is called for today.
A strong warning that defects in baby boys born now may not become
obvious for a further 20-40 years is published in The Lancet.
It says more research is vital if a further decline in sperm counts is
to be prevented and testing every man-made chemical cannot be ruled out.
The call follows a report by the Danish government highlighting the
need for more research into effects of environmental pollution on male
fertility.
The main culprits are xeno-oestrogens -- environmental chemicals that
mimic the actions of the female hormone, oestrogen.
It has been known for some time that a wide range of oestrogenic
pollutants is presumed responsible for the reproductive changes in human
males.
These include organophosphate pesticides like DDT, Polychlorinated
biphenals (PCBs),and dioxins.
But the effects of tens of thousands of man-made chemicals with which
we come into daily contact, are not yet clear.
If as the report suggests adverse changes are linked to early exposure
in the womb, research should start immediately on the nature and
exposure of these compounds in women.
The Danish report follows work led by Professor Niels Skakkebaek and
scientists from America, the UK, Finland and France.

THE IRA made it clear yesterday that its ceasefire would continue.
But it also made it clear it was not happy with political progress
seven months into the ceasefire, and in its Easter message warned that
the Government would have to face up to its responsibilites if the peace
process was to have any hope of success.
The message, to be read out at 17 republican rallies and marches
across Ireland, said a ''historic opportunity has been created for the
realisation of a just and lasting peace''.
It indicated that its ultimate aim remained a united Ireland. ''It is
self-evident that partition has failed and that British rule has
failed.''
The conflict of the last quarter of a century stemmed directly from
British policy, it said. ''Britain's core responsibility logically
dictates that they must face up to their role in any process aimed at
finding a solution to the conflict.
''Britain's shouldering of its responsibilities is essential if such a
process is to be meaningful or is to have any hope of success.''
It called for all parties to resolve to leave behind the failures of
the past and seize the potential opportunity to build ''a new a free
Ireland which removes the divisions of the past''.
The IRA said it remained ''united and strong, confident and
determined''.
It warned that no-one should delude themselves about the commitment to
face ''whatever challenges and tasks'' lay ahead.
''Our desire for freedom has outlived every British administration in
Ireland and has faced down all the powerful resources pitted against
us.''
At the same time it became clear that Irish Premier John Bruton was
behind a last-minute change in the script of an announcement by the
Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, on Wednesday that he was
inviting the four main political parties to start bi-lateral talks with
the Government after Easter.
The original draft spoke of inviting the four constitutional parties,
but not Sinn Fein, to talks. The Irish Government objected -- it
believes Sinn Fein to be a constitutional party.
Sir Patrick redrafted the offending paragraph to remove the word
constitutional.
Mr Bruton admitted he had ''expressed a view'' about the speech.
''Our view is that we must work towards totally inclusive dialogue
with all the relavent parties involved and we would not wish any
phraseology to be used that appeared to put them (Sinn Fein) to one
side.''
The pressure on Britain to move towards Ministerial talks with Sinn
Fein continued to mount during the day.
Sinn Fein itself said it was waiting for a written reply from the
Northern Ireland Office to its latest attempt to remove the obstacles
over discussion of decommissioning IRA weapons.
Mr Bruton said he was ''certain'' a formula would be found to allow
the long-awaited talks to take place.
* A number of people were arrested and several weapons seized
yesterday during a full-scale security operation in Holywood, County
Down.

WHISPER it . . . the search for someone to the play The Bruce has
moved to England after screen tests north of the Border failed to find
an actor for the role.
This week at a hotel near Heathrow Airport around a dozen Scots
actors, based in and around the London area, went through their paces as
the film's backers tried, tried, and tried again to come up with the
right man.
The Bruce, after some scheduling problems, is expected to be filmed in
Scotland during June.
The successful candidate will play alongside actor Brian Blessed whose
role is Edward I, Hammer of the Scots, and Michale Van Wijk, better
known as Wolf from TV's Gladiators who takes the part of Sir Humphrey de
Bohun.
Oliver Reed also is expected to appear in the film as Bishop Wishart
of Glasgow, an adviser to Robert the Bruce, but negotiations with
Richard Harris have fallen through because of scheduling commitments.
Last month, after auditions at Edinburgh's Filmhouse, the producers
set up screen tests at Craigmillar Castle, on the outskirts of the city,
confident that among the short-leet drawn up they could make a decision
on the main role.
However, no suitable candidate was found although those who attended
auditions for a full dress rehearsal may find themselves offered
supporting roles.
Mr Peter Ross, who manages the Scottish operation of Cromwell
Productions, revealed yesterday that new auditions had been held in
London on Wednesday.
''The people at Craigmillar on various accounts were not suitable,''
said Mr Ross. ''There are a lot of Scots actors based in and around
London and we thought it was sensible to go down there and give them the
opportunity.''
He said no decision had yet been taken on the actor to play The Bruce
in the ''historical epic''.
Meanwhile, a young Scot will be the main attraction in London's West
End when he stars in a royal premiere screening of his latest film.
Paisley-born schoolboy Lee Turnbull, 12, plays the lead role in the
feature film Willie's War, due to be screened by Channel 4 later this
year.
He will share the limelight with actress Jean Alexander who played
Coronation Street's Hilda Ogden, when they attend the gala screening at
the Prince Charles Cinema in Leicester Square, London, on May 4.
Prince Edward, president, and Sir Richard Attenborough, vice president
of the Children's Film Unit which made the production, will be guests of
honour at the premiere, which will be followed by a reception in the
Cafe Royal.
Lee, who studied acting at the Anna Sher drama school after moving to
London at the age of eight, has been making a name for himself as one of
the UK's leading young performers. He looks set to follow in the
footsteps of another famous Sher star pupil, Michael Caine.
Recently, he appeared in two episodes of The Bill and featured in an
anti-school bullying campaign commercial.
He is soon to be seen on TV screens in two episodes of BBC1's new
prime time drama series The Vet, and London theatre-goers will see him
on stage alongside Vanessa Redgrave in the Riverside Theatre Company's
production of The Liberation of Skopje.
The youngster, who says he would rather play football for Rangers than
become a top actor, travelled to Scotland this week on a special mission
-- to get kitted out for his royal command performance in full Highland
dress.
His father, Lee, snr, explained: ''Lee's Ibrox-daft and insisted on
being kitted out in a Rangers tartan kilt for his big night in London.
''We couldn't find an outfitter to supply us with a Rangers'
tartan kilt, so we had to come home to Paisley to hire one.
''When local outfitters Houston's Menswear heard of Lee's plight,
they agreed to provide a full outfit free of charge. He is absolutely
thrilled.''
In Willie's War, set in the 1940s, Lee plays a Cockney evacuee who
finds life hard when billeted with the well-heeled Suffolk country set.

<HEADLINE>Ambassadors expected to back deal to end conflict between Spain fishing nations Peace in sight over Spanish armada</HEADLINE>

THE North Atlantic fishing war between Spain and Canada could be over
soon.
EU ambassadors meet today to endorse a deal thrashed out yesterday in
Brussels.
Details of the agreement remained secret while Spain decided whether
to accept its terms.
But EU Commission officials made it clear that the end was near after
more than a month of conflict off Newfoundland.
At stake is the catch of Greenland halibut in international waters in
the north-west Atlantic this year.
Trouble started when Europe challenged its allocation of little more
than 3000 tonnes of Greenland halibut out of a total available catch of
27,000 tonnes this year. This compares with a 44,000-tonne EU catch last
year.
While Brussels contested the scale of the reduction, Spanish trawlers
kept on fishing, and Canada last minth declared an exclusion zone beyond
its own 200-mile fishing limit.
The fish quota talks have struggled on in the midst of growing tension
at sea, with Canadian patrol boats harassing Spanish vessels and
challenging the legality of their catches of Greenland halibut.
Canada offered the EU 10,000 tonnes of the total share, taking the
same for itself and giving the remaining ,000 tonnes to Japan, Russia,
and the Baltic states, which also fish the zone.
But Spain demanded 13,500 tonnes -- an ambitious target which even
other EU Governments deemed extreme. Last night, Madrid was considering
a compromise share-out which could end a growing diplomatic and
political embarrassment which has left Britain with divided loyalites
between its old Commonwelath ally and a fellow EU member state.
As well as the share-out of fish, the deal includes two other key
elements -- the return of the #300,000 bail bond handed to Canada for
the release of the trawler Estai seized by the Canadians last month, and
the question of any EU-Canada carve-up of fish being ratified by the
North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation.
The solution is likely to involve Japan and Russia giving up some of
their proposed allocation of Greenland halibut to top up Canada and
Spain's share -- assuming agreement has been reached on compensation and
on Nafo's backing for the terms of any deal.
0 Meanwhile, fishermen burned the European Union flag outside a mass
meeting aimed at putting pressure on the Government to withdraw Britain
from the Common Fisheries Policy.
The protest came after the skipper of a Cornish crabber arrested in a
French port for flying the Canadian flag said the experience would only
strengthen the resolve of West Country fishermen.
He and his crew were flying the Maple Leaf flag aboard their Newlyn
boat in support of Canada's fishing dispute with Spain.
Around 200 South-West fishermen, industry campaigners, and politicians
gathered in Plymouth, Devon, yesterday in the latest move to sink the
CFP, whose quotas British fishermen claim are loaded against their
interests.
They fear their livelihoods and fish stocks are at risk from foreign
fleets, particularly Spanish, which flout the rules on under-sized fish.
Their concern was heightened with the recent Government-backed EU
agreement to allow Spanish boats into previously exclusive Irish Box
waters from next year.
''From January 1, when our friends get into the Irish Box it is the
beginning of the end,'' said Looe harbour commissioner Donald Webb, who
organised the meeting.
The Save Britain's Fish Campaign, backed by most UK fishermen, wants
the Government to declare a 200-mile limit.
SBF Campaign's technical adviser John Ashworth said the UK's fish had
been ''given away.
''Where does this asset stripping end, and who is going to start
standing up for Britain,'' he said.

A ROW has erupted over claims by Lothian Health Council that Scottish
mothers and their premature babies have been flown to hospitals in
Belfast and Newcastle because of a lack of special care facilities in
Scotland.
The Scottish Office yesterday denied any knowledge of the airlifts and
denied claims that the Government had failed to complete a two-year-old
study into Scottish special baby care provision.
But a father of premature triplets who was forced to drive his wife 80
miles to a Dundee hospital in 1991 because there was insufficient
special baby care provision in Glasgow, has confirmed he was told an
airlift to Belfast was the only other option.
One of Scotland's leading obstetricians said Glasgow's Royal Maternity
Hospital is still taking babies from as far afield as Dumfries and the
Western Isles and on a regular basis from Edinburgh, where provision is
under immense pressure.
Yesterday The Herald exclusively revealed reports by Lothian Health
Council that on a number of occasions Scottish mothers and their babies
had been flown to Belfast and Newcastle hospitals after no intensive
care cots were available in Scotland.
The spokeswoman said the health council was told that two years ago
the Scottish Office began a review of special baby care provision in
Scotland.
Yesterday afternoon the Scottish Office said claims that babies had
been flown to Newcastle and Belfast were ''wrong'' and it was not aware
of any instances where babies had been transferred out of the country.
''The question of a Government inquiry into special baby care
provision is also wrong. The Scottish Office is not carrying out any
inquiry into this subject, not are there any plans to do so,'' said a
spokesman.
Mr Gordon Henry of Milngavie told The Herald that when his wife
Janette gave birth to triplets eight weeks prematurely in 1991 and then
developed pre-eclampsia -- a condition which can prove fatal -- he had
to drive her 80 miles to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where she stayed
in intensive care for nine days.
''I was told that if we hadn't picked Dundee when we did, the only
option left was to go to Belfast,'' he said.
Dr Bobby Low, a senior obstetrician at the Royal Maternity Hospital
confirmed that before a recent increase in the number of special baby
care cots in Glasgow, flights to Belfast were an option when Scottish
provision couldn't cope.
Yesterday Lothian Health Council stood by its statements. ''We are
aware of cases where mothers and premature babies have been flown to
Belfast,'' said a spokeswoman.
She added that the health council was particularly concerned by
Scottish Office denials that it had undertaken a review of special baby
care provision.
Last night the Scottish Office admitted it could not give ''an
absolute categoric assurance'' that Scottish mothers and their babies
had not been airlifted to English or Northern Irish hospitals.

NEW safety rules governing the movement of Royal Navy and allied
submarines in Britain's crowded coastal waters are likely to be ratified
by UK fishermen's organisations next week.
The guidelines include the stationing of a naval guardship to act as a
liaison point between trawlers and submarines during exercises, the
appointment of a senior fisheries liaison officer to collate and give
advance warning of submarine activity, and intensive training for all
officers who might be in temporary control of a submarine.
Plans to tighten safety regulations were drawn up earlier this year
after the RN admitted that one of its nuclear-powered hunter-killer
boats, HMS Valiant, had breached existing guidelines.
The submarine's towed-array sonar, a 3000-metre cable packed with
electronic sensors, snagged the nets of the Sutherland trawler
Audacious, off the Butt of Lewis in November 1993.
The incident happened almost three years to the day from the sinking
of the Carradale trawler Antares by HMS Trenchant in the Sound of Bute.
Four fishermen died when their boat was accidentally dragged beneath the
waves off Arran.
That incident triggered an outcry from fishermen who demanded action
to reduce the constant danger of collision and snagging.
It resulted, after a year of consultation, in a naval instruction that
submarines were to maintain a minimum separation from the nearest
fishing vessel of 1500 yards at periscope depth and 4000 yards when
fully submerged.
Advance notice of submarine activity was also broadcast by the
Coastguard at four-hourly intervals, and all UK submarine commanders
were issued with Cell-net telephones and a list of trawler numbers for
contact in emergency.
Despite the withdrawal of the US Poseidon missile squadron at the end
of the Cold War, 90% of all RN submarine movement still takes place in
and around the Clyde.
Mr Patrick Stewart, secretary of the 135-boat Clyde Fishermen's
Association and a campaigner for safety, said yesterday: ''It seems that
we have, at long last, a workable set of rules which satisfy both sides
and meet most of our safety requirements.''
Meanwhile, the nine candidates for this year's gruelling ''Perisher''
course -- the five-month assessment of potential submarine commanders --
are to go to sea on trawlers from Tarbert, Loch Fyne, next week to give
them a fisherman's-eye view of the problems.
All UK candidates are making a once-only bid for command of a nuclear
boat. Those who fail are ''binned'' from the submarine service.
A naval spokesman said last night: ''It has become a standard part of
safety training for officers of the watch to spend time at sea with
fishermen. It enables each side to appreciate the other's problems.''

A 13 year-old boy injured when a whisky barrel exploded was in a
stable condition in hospital yesterday. )He had emergency surgery for
serious head injuries following an incident in Paisley on Wednesday.
Richard Elliot, of Ferguslie Park Avenue, Paisley, was apparently
playing with fire beside whisky barrels in the Underwood cooperage in
Greenhill Road, Paisley, when one of the barrels exploded.
Police believe that he and a friend had been lighting pieces of paper
and putting them into a whisky barrel which was empty but whisky fumes
are thought to have caused an explosion.
Richard was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley suffering
from serious facial and head injuries and underwent surgery on Wednesday
night.
He was later transferred to the hospital's high dependency unit where
his condition was yesterday described as serious, but stable.

FEARS of a Maytime rise in interest rates grew yesterday after a
disappointing set of inflation figures for March.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor
of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, meet on May 5, the day after
the local elections in England and Wales.
To compensate for sterling's 4% fall this year the two men are likely
to agree on a 0.5% increase in base rates to 7.25% in time for the
publication of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report the
following Thursday.
Last month shop prices rose by 0.4% and the headline rate of inflation
edged up from 3.4% to 3.5%, its highest level for two-and-a-half years.
The other inflation measures moved in line. The underlying RPIX rate,
which excludes mortgage interest payments, advanced from 2.7% to 2.8%,
the third successive month it had been in the upper half of the
Government's 1% to 4% target range.
The new RPIY rate, which also excludes indirect and local authority
taxes, moved from 1.8% to 1.9%, but its three-month annualised rate
jumped from 2.5% to 2.8%. This is the inflation measure most favoured by
the Bank of England.
Household goods prices jumped by 1.5% last month, a record for March.

SCOTTISH charities are furious that National Lottery money could be
used to fund certain projects undertaken by National Health Service
trusts.
According to the National Lottery Charities Board's Scottish committee
chairman, Mr Allan Wilson, NHS trusts, as well as charities, could apply
for a share of the estimated #15m lottery fund, provided their projects
meet certain criteria.
He said the lottery board will complete its consultation with
organisations keen for a share of lottery money this week. After
guidelines are drawn up, charities will be able to apply next month for
the funds to be distributed in Scotland in the autumn.
Mr Wilson said non-mainstream hospital projects could receive a slice
of the #10-#15m. He was unable to say what the specific criteria would
be until guidelines were completed, but added: ''We've not taken a
specific decision on this, but what I can say is that, if someone has a
project that deals with, say, medical research, then we will look
favourably at it.
''If it's to fund a trust for one of its statutory duties, we are not
allowed to do that, but we would be able to look at the merits of other
projects.''
The statement has angered the Scottish charities umbrella
organisation, the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations in
Edinburgh. Although acknowledging that any project with a charitable,
philanthropic or benevolent purpose is entitled to apply for lottery
money, SCVO's director Mr Martin Sime said lottery money should not be
used to pay for projects that were not but ought to be funded by the
Government.
''Many hospitals have endowment funds that are registered as
charities. Under the lotteries legislation, they are eligible to apply
to the board. My view is that the lottery board should give applications
from NHS trusts a very, very low priority. Why give money back to the
Government?''
He said that many charities had lost out to the lottery and should not
have to compete with NHS trust projects for money. ''Technically they
can apply, but what would be of concern is if the lottery was used to
supplement public services.''
Last night, several NHS trusts said they were not aware that hospitals
qualified for funding for non-mainstream projects and so had not
considered applying to the lottery board next month.

THE FAMILY of an elderly man who died after disappearing from a
retirement home have called for a fresh investigation into his death
following the conviction of two of his carers for perjury during a
previous fatal accident inquiry.
Mr Daniel Lowe, 73, was found dead with chest and spinal injuries in
February 1994 more than 12 hours after he had wandered off from the
Hillcrest retirement home in Wigtown.
At a fatal accident inquiry six months later care workers Robert
Thorley, the son of the then owners, and Marie Blackley said that both
had been on duty at the time and that a search had been instigated at
once for the missing man.
Yesterday, however, Stranraer Sheriff Court heard that both had lied
and that Thorley had been sleeping at his girlfriend's house nearby when
the alarm was finally raised.
Following submissions from procurator-fiscal depute Andrew Laing and
defence agents for both accused that future court procedings may be
prejudiced by dealing in full with the case Sheriff Robert Dickson
deferred sentence for six months.
He told the accused: ''I am prepared to defer sentence in this case
but I would warn you that this does not mean, as it does in some cases,
that everything will be alright when you return.
''The court takes perjury very, very seriously indeed as it strikes at
the basic fabric of justice.''
The sheriff added that justice had been perverted in the inquiry into
the tragic death of an old man and that it was not possible to say what
the outcome would have been if both accused had been there as they
claimed they had been.
''I do not think there is any doubt that Sheriff Smith would have
given a different determination if he had been told the full story.
Indeed certain sections of his findings would probably not have been
there,'' the sheriff added.
As he left the court after hearing evidence, Mr Eric Lowe, 68, brother
of the deceased, said: ''I was disgusted by what I heard today. It is
sickening to think that two people who were responsible for Dan's care
should have failed to do their job and then lie about it.
''He was a popular man all his days and it makes me sad and angry that
he met his end in this lonely way. It will help us a wee bit with the
truth coming out and maybe Dan can rest in peace.''
His daughter and niece of the dead man, Mrs Agnes Palmer, said: ''We
have heard today that two important witnesses lied in the fatal accident
inquiry so how can the findings of that inquiry be correct?
''I think that there should be an inquiry at which all the facts can
be aired and perhaps we can learn more about the last hours of Dan's
life. No one deserves to die in this way and then for the whole truth
not be told about his death.
''I also feel strongly that more supervision of homes like Hillcrest
is required.''
The court heard that Mr Lowe was reported missing to police in the
early hours of February 7 last year and that a number of officers
assisted by a police dog searched in vain.
No trace was found until daylight when a cap and slipper were
discovered near a 12ft high wall bordering the Wigtown and Bladnoch golf
course. Mr Lowe's body was discovered some time later in a ditch some
100 yards away.
Mr Laing told the court that during police interviews and later at the
inquiry both Thorley, 29, of Seaview and Blackley, 37, of Beddie
Crescent, both Wigtown, had said that both were on duty on the night in
question.
He continued: ''Marie Blackley said she had been on waking duty and
Robert Thorley on sleeping duty in the home which was in accordance with
the rules.
''Some time later police were contacted and doubt cast on their
stories. When they were interviewed they seemed relieved and both
admitted that they had given false evidence. Since then they have
co-operated fully with the police and myself.''
Sentence will be passed on the pair on October 16.

TONY Blair yesterday found the Labour Party's agenda under attack on
three fronts.
There was a backlash from ''old Labour'' against moves to redraft
Clause 4, impatience over the party's refusal to fix a figure for a
national minimum wage, and anger at its plan to close down failing
schools.
Mr Blair's campaign to modernise Labour's constitution was dealt a
blow when members of Unison, the country's biggest union, voted to
retain Clause 4, the party's historic commitment to nationalisation.
At a meeting in London of Unison's national political forum, delegates
voted by 55 to 47 to oppose redrafting the clause. The decision went in
the face of a recommendation by the union's national political committee
and a speech by Labour's deputy leader, Mr John Prescott.
Unison has 11.5% of the vote at a conference to be held on April 29
when Labour will decide whether to replace the clause.
Mr Geoff Martin, a leading member of the Defend Clause 4 Campaign and
a member of the Unison delegation to the Labour conference, described
yesterday's result as a breakthrough.
''The vote also proves that Tony Blair cannot ride roughshod over the
trade union movement. The decision is binding on our delegation to the
special conference and if there is any attempt to try to alter that
position, it will be resisted.''
Mr Prescott admitted the result was ''disappointing'' but said he was
still confident that the new wording would be accepted.
''The new clause has received the overwhelming support of the national
executive committee of the Labour Party and all the indications are that
the constituency Labour parties that have so far balloted their members
show overwhelming support for the new Clause 4.''
The Transport and General Workers' Union has already made clear its
opposition to the new clause. Its delegation will meet hours before the
April 29 conference to decide how to cast the TGWU's vote.
Meanwhile, Mr Blair was attacked by TGWU leader Bill Morris over the
Labour leadership's resistance to fixing a national minimum wage level.
Mr Morris, currently seeking re-election as the union's general
secretary, said the campaign for a minimum wage needed to be made
''vivid''.
''For that we need a figure. At least #4 an hour should be it,'' he
said, writing in the New Statesman &amp; Society.
In a swipe clearly aimed at Mr Blair, he said: ''Let's be clear --
whatever figure we put on the minimum wage, the Tories will try to
attack us.'' But he added: ''If we didn't campaign for things because
the Tories would attack us, children would still be down coal mines and
up chimneys.''
At the last General Election, Labour campaigned for a minimum wage of
#3.40 an hour. But it was immediately criticised by employers and the
Conservatives who suggested that the figure could fuel unemployment.
This time round, it is understood that Mr Blair has told union leaders
that he will not set a target for a minimum wage until after the
election, because a new Labour government would want to examine the
books before deciding on a figure.
Responding to Mr Morris's attack, Mr Prescott said: ''Certainly we
need to make the campaign for a mininum wage more vivid and bring home
to people that if you are living on #1.50 an hour, that's certainly
pretty vivid. We are committed to a statutory framework to improve
that.''
To cap a bad day for Mr Blair, Labour came under pressure to drop its
plan to close failing schools in England and Wales. Under the scheme,
outlined earlier this week by Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett,
such schools would be closed and reopened with new governors, a new
head, and new teachers.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, told his union's conference in Harrogate that said Labour
seemed to think that Tory policies, ''if adroitly repackaged'', would
bring it to power.
TUC general secretary John Monks said the plan smacked of the ''style
of a football club who sack the manager when the team is bottom of the
league''. But Mr Blunkett hit back, saying he was being tough on failure
and mediocrity.

THE Law Society of Scotland is expected to block any attempt by
disgraced solicitors Gordon and Maria Thomson to pursue a career
connected with the law.
The society has wide statutory powers which it can invoke to control
the future employment of solicitors who have been struck off or
suspended.
Gordon Thomson, 36, and his wife, Maria, 34, were found guilty of
professional misconduct last week by the Scottish Solicitors Discipline
Tribunal.
The tribunal described the case as undoubtedly the worst of its kind
to come before it over a long period of years.
It had no hesitation in saying that the Thomsons were unfit to remain
as members of the legal profession and ordered that they should be
struck off the roll of practising solicitors.
In a damning summary of its written findings, the tribunal stated that
the Thomsons had sacrificed the interests of their clients in pursuit of
making as much money as possible.
The striking off will not take effect for several weeks until the full
written findings of the tribunal have been intimated to the couple, and
they have stated their intention to appeal against their banishment from
the profession.
However, it is extremely rare, if not unprecedented, for the Court of
Session to countermand a striking off order by the tribunal.
Since the judgment was issued last week, there has been continuing
speculation in the legal profession that the Thomsons would seek legal
work in some other capacity, perhaps as unqualified para-legals.
Since there is an appeal pending in the case, no-one at the Law
Society was prepared to comment on that possibility, but The Herald
understands that the likelihood of a legal comeback by the Thomsons is
remote.
Section 47 of the Solicitors' (Scotland) Act places a restriction on
the employment of a solicitor who has been struck off or suspended.
The Act states: ''Unless he has the written permission of the Council
(of the Law Society), a solicitor shall not, in connection with his
practice as a solicitor, employ or remunerate any person who is
disqualified from practising by reason of the fact that his name has
been struck off the roll or that he is suspended from practice.''
Any lawyer who contravenes the section can himself be struck off or
suspended.
The subordinate legislation contained in the Solicitors' (Scotland)
Practice Rules gives the Law Society even wider powers to regulate the
future employment of rogue lawyers.
There would, however, be nothing to stop the couple pursuing some
other line of work, such as estate agency or as precognition agents,
taking statements from witnesses in court cases.
Estate agents are ''negative registered'' in the sense that anyone can
be an estate agent, provided they are not proscribed by the
Director-General of Fair Trading.
The director-general can forbid anyone becoming an estate agent if he
has convictions or has been found guilty of serious professional
misconduct.
