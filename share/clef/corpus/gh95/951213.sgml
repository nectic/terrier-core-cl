<HEADLINE>Woman `sent to Coventry' after affair, tribunal told</HEADLINE>

A WOMAN was ``sent to Coventry'' when she returned to work at a data-processing
plant after her affair with the boss ended, an industrial tribunal heard
yesterday.
Mrs Jenny McMillan, 25, from Ardrossan, was the subject of gossip and rumours
because of her affair with Mr Mike Dale, Saztec Europe's deputy general manager
at the time, the Glasgow tribunal was told.
The affair ended, then Mrs McMillan, a senior coding supervisor, went on sick
leave, suffering from stress after her grandmother's death. On her return, she
claimed, she was effectively demoted. She had no desk or office, no personal
belongings and she faced a drop in salary. She resigned and claimed
constructive dismissal.
Mrs June Watson, a worker at the company, said that on Mrs McMillan's first day
back she was put in a room to work alone, given menial tasks and ``sent to
Coventry''. Mrs Watson said: ``She looked really down. She said she was
terrible. She didn't have an office, she didn't have a desk, she didn't have
any personal belongings.''
Mrs Joanna Milligan, a project worker at the plant, said that Mrs McMillan was
given the task of assisting her on a very important project on her return to
work. She was being given a chance to be in on a new job from square one. She
said Mrs McMillan was still senior coding supervisor, but agreed that her
duties that day were not consistent with that title.
Mrs Milligan told the tribunal: ``Jenny didn't seem to mind that day where she
worked. She made the comment that she didn't care what people thought, she was
only here for the money.''
However, she agreed that Mrs McMillan, who had been responsible for supervising
up to 49 workers, was in charge of no-one on the day she came back.
The tribunal heard earlier that Mr Dale, a married father of two from Yateley,
Hampshire, who is now vice-president and general manager, also had an affair
with another employee, former production manager-designate Ms Ruth Donnachie,
before his relationship with Mrs McMillan.
Ms Donnachie said that she also ended up losing her job after the affair ended.
She said that, when she told Mr Dale she was seeing someone else, he called her
an ``evil bitch''.
Ms Donnachie said that the next week her sister was sacked as personnel manager
and she herself was made redundant in May last year.
Mr Dale told the tribunal at an earlier hearing that he still missed Ms
Donnachie, and agreed his involvement with the two employees had been a mistake.
He said he had nothing to do with Mrs McMillan's departure. The hearing
continues today.

THE biggest movement of British troops since the Gulf war was announced to the
Commons yesterday by Defence Secretary Michael Portillo.
The British contribution to the Bosnian peace implementation force, expected to
be on the move before Christmas, will be a total of 13,000 troops, although no
Scottish regiments will be involved. They will include signallers, engineers,
medical teams and logistic troops, and will be backed up by 7500 vehicles and
7000 tonnes of ammunition. There will be Challenger tanks, AS90 heavy artillery
and armed helicopters.
Mr Portillo warned in a statement to the House: ``Of course, they will seek to
use persuasion to implement the peace, and in the British Army even the most
junior ranks have experience of making highly sensitive judgements on the spot.
But when they need to take robust action they will be equipped and authorised
to do so.''
The Defence Secretary's statement stemmed from the expectation that the Bosnian
peace agreement will be signed in Paris tomorrow. Within a few days, Nato will
take over full military responsibility from the UN and deploy forces to
implement the agreement.
Mr Portillo said: ``Our mission is to oversee the separation of the warring
factions and the return to barracks of their soldiers, and to provide the
security necessary for Bosnia and Herzegovina to establish national
institutions and hold free elections.
``Nato's mission is rightly limited in scope. It is also limited in duration -
to 12 months.''
Britain would supply a brigade and a divisional headquarters to command one of
the three military sectors and, in addition, Britain had the leading role in
commanding Nato's Rapid Reaction Corps - a British-led, multinational Nato
force. Britain also would provide most of the field headquarters controlling
the whole operation.''
For Labour, Defence spokesman Dr David Clark welcomed the statement. He said:
``Our experience in Northern Ireland will serve us well when we try to broker
peace and ensure it is continued between three different nations. We wish our
troops who will serve in the new mission every success and we trust every one
of them will return home safely.''
He added: ``We welcome the strengthening of the rules of engagement and we have
argued all along that our troops in this situation should not be
disadvantaged.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Menzies Campbell voiced support for the operation
and confidence that British forces would ``fulfil their responsibilities with
distinction and with professionalism''.
Mr Campbell expressed the hope that the 12-month timescale referred to by Mr
Portillo was ``a target and not a deadline, and that if the peace agreement is
on course for successful implementation, there will be no automatic withdrawal
at the expiry of 12 months''.
The Defence Secretary insisted that the mission was ``well achievable within
the 12-month period''.

BRUNTON'S theatre space is currently under renovation, but as my chum Ofpants
is wont to say: ``Two planks and a passion gives you theatah. One plank missing
gives you panto!'' Quite. And panto is what you get if you venture upstairs to
Brunton's Main Hall, valiantly disguised with gauzy draperies and coloured
lights.
Here, director Robin Peoples and his team do battle with the twin demons of
boomy acoustics and level seating by setting the action on steeply stepped
rostra which are liberally scattered with microphones.
So much good effort has gone into overcoming the limitations of this space - a
change of scenery gets slotted in like some huge Pollok's toy theatre,
Carabosse's chariot actually comes among us, much to the delighted fright of
the young audience - that it's a shame the script itself wasn't a bit fresher.
Raymond Ross's Sleeping Beauty follows close on the heels - and the storylines
- of the version recently featuring Les Dennis as Lester the Jester.
Not necessarily cause for an automatic thumbs down - panto is, after all, a
retelling of the familiar - but the morning I saw it, I was struck by how
sparse some of the material was. I suppose I had expected more of a show from
Russel Hunter's dame - is this, maybe, reserved for evening/more adult
audiences? And remembering how cleverly bumbling Kevin MacLeod was, in last
year's panto, I felt he was disappointingly under used as Norval the witch's
numpty henchman.
Still, Paul Reilly's Lester (yes, a jester) kept the audience cheerfully on the
ball, Marjory Hogarth's Carabosse achieved a high Eek! factor, while Diane
Sobolewska brought a nice touch of the hoyden to the princess - and the best
bit of stage magic.......she doubled as the Good Fairy. Our official panto
watchdog passed it on points - but felt the cast deserved better material.

FOUR Scots fishermen yesterday watched a Royal Navy bomb squad blow up 500lbs
of TNT that had shared their trawler with them for seven days. They had thought
it was a drum of paint.
Coastguards said the explosives, trawled up off the island of Fetlar by the
Kirkcaldy-registered Integrity III, were the central core of a Second World War
mine. They warned fishermen to report immediately anything ``unidentified or
strange'' found in their nets.
The Integrity III was loading ice at a Lerwick pier on Monday, within 500 yards
of two crowded shopping centres, when a shore worker alerted her skipper Kelvin
MacGregor to the danger.

Joan Grady reports on a businesscompetition which has helpedfive companies to
expand
IN April this year five Glasgow-based companies each received #20,000 to
increase their export potential and create jobs. Since then, those companies
have gone on to generate #1,000,000 in additional export sales and open up new
markets all over the world.
This was the result of the first International Executive Scheme, the biggest
business-related competition in the country, run by the Glasgow Development
Agency. It is now ready to launch another round of awards, designed to
encourage small and medium-sized companies in Glasgow to think about expanding
into a more global market.
``Glasgow Development Agency is committed to supporting export growth under its
objective of improving the performance of existing businesses,'' said GDA chief
executive Stuart Gulliver. ``Glasgow's companies export, on average, at half
the rate of companies across Scotland and the UK.
``The International Executive Scheme has been developed to offer support for
those companies showing a commitment to increasing export sales. It has already
proved to be a tremendous success.''
Companies entering the competition must be Glasgow-based and involved in export
business. They must demonstrate that with outside help, they can introduce
changes to improve export potential. Each successful company will receive
#20,000 over two years as a contribution to the cost of recruiting a new export
executive.
GDA offers back-up in drawing up job descriptions and getting through the
recruitment process. It will help the winning company draw up an export action
plan and arrange a ``health check'' of export activities by an experienced
export consultant.
Aftercare is provided through informal meetings of the winning companies during
which they can exchange information, ideas and advice. There are also training
days on export-related topics such as credit control and distribution.
A recent survey of Glasgow companies showed that 29% of exporters based their
businesses on unsolicited orders from overseas. GDA help such companies
increase proactive exporting and improve sales potential.
In 1992, California Cake &amp; Cookie Limited sold all its products in the UK
market. It had a steady turnover of #1.8m and a healthy number of bluechip
clients, including British Airways, Sainsbury and Tesco.
``We had a popular range of products, we were maintaining our position in the
marketplace and the scene was set for something to happen,'' said executive
chairman Tom Lambie. ``And it did - at a trade exbibition in England.''
The company was approached by Joanne Alexander Sefre, a former British Bakeries
export manger who was at the time looking for quality British cake products
which could be sold on the Continent.
Sefre produced a business plan outlining her proposals to market a range of the
Company's products in France, and California Cake &amp; Cookie saw the chance to
expand its market and boost its sales.
``It was evident that Joanne had the necessary knowledge and experience of
working in this market sector,'' said Lambie. ``Here was an opportunity to
explore the potential of increasing sales at a time when the home market was as
difficult as ever.'' Sefre's knowledge of languages and wide range of contacts
in the Eurpean food retail and wholesale trade made her the ideal agent for the
company. The award from GDA provided the necessary cash flow to produce
labelling and point of sale materials in languages other than English and help
offset Sefre's cost.
Exports now account for 2.5% of total sales, adding to and not replacing the
already existing home sales. French supermarket chain Monoprix, which has more
than 300 retail outlets, placed a #20,000 promotional order, giving California
Cake &amp; Cookie a listing as one of its suppliers.
Tom Lambie was delighted with the result, and recognises the enormous efforts
put in by the whole team and the GDA's valuable contribution. ``What has been
achieved over the last two years has been done through careful planning, hard
work and targeted assistance from the Glasgow Development Agency,'' he said.
``The #20,000 was a financial leg-up which helped short-cut a lot of work.
A key area of GDA strategy is to improve the relatively low levels of Glasgow's
exporting activities. 50 companies of all shapes and sizes entered the first
year of the International Executive Scheme, and the GDA hopes to elicit the
same response this time around.

Mitton at the Glasgow Development Agency on 0141 242 8227

A SCOTTISH teenager's hopes of selling an invention worldwide is in jeopardy
after he missed the deadline for the international patent because of lack of
money.
Martin Johnstone, 18, of Acres Road, Kingussie, Inverness-shire, fears big
manufacturers will steal his idea and market the prototype car cycle rack.
The device is powered directly from a vehicle's cigarette lighter and allows it
to show rear light signals clearly even when it is carrying luggage such as
bicycles.
Martin has won several national awards and appeared on the TV programme Eureka.
His father, Mark, has spent more than #20,000 showing the device at exhibitions.
However, Mr Johnstone, 45, could not yesterday raise the #4600 needed to
protect a world-wide patent application lodged with Glasgow's Murgitroyds. ``I
just simply do have anymore money left to plough into this project. We need a
backer if we are going to get this project off the ground but I am losing hope
now.''
He added: ``We need further capital of around #30,000 to manufacture the first
1000 units from our Kingussie workshops. It will be an absolute tragedy if
Martin's idea is stolen by someone else.''
He estimates that Tail-lit, as Martin calls it, would retail at around #65 and
could reach a potential market of 20,000 each year, based on enquiries to trade
manufacturers.
The idea for the project came when father and son were travelling down the A9
and got stuck behind a vehicle which was dangerously laden with bicycles
obscuring its brake lights.
At the time Martin was looking for ideas for a technical project at school and
he took up the challenge.
His head teacher at Kingussie High School, Mr Brian Dziennick, helped out and
the invention was soon thrust into the limelight of national television.

SCOTLAND'S Roads Minister last night welcomed a drop in the percentage of
drivers who failed or refused the breath test, over the first 18 days of the
country's latest drink-drive campaign, compared to last year's figures.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, however, said the level of positive tests was
still much too high.
``The police are operating a high level of breath testing this year and people
who drink and drive run a very high risk of being caught.
``Motorists must continue to heed the message that drinking and driving wrecks
lives.''
According to the latest figures released by the Association of Chief Police
Officers in Scotland the number tested from November 24 to December 11 was
30,290 as against 20,148 for the same period last year.
However, the proportion of people who failed or refused the breath test was
only 1.8%, compared with 2.6% last year.

HOW can anyone be a communist in 1995? The question is all the harder to answer
in Berlin whence, before long, one of the world's most successful capitalist
economies will be governed.
Berlin still bears the scars of its history, but the plastic surgery is radical
and rapid. By the time the federal government shifts from Bonn at the end of
the decade, this will be a dramatic post-modern metropolis, a portent of the
twenty-first century and, with its four million citizens, among the largest
cities in Europe. Perhaps people will come to admire it as they did the London
of Sir Christopher Wren or the Paris of Baron Haussman.
For the time being, East Berlin is actually more chic than West Berlin. The
west was always a rather soulless exemplar of post-war Germany, a sea of
concrete rendered interesting only by the barbed wire round it. The east,
despite or because of its desperate dilapidation and its bolder brutalism, is
the more evocative place.
It houses what remains - and, restored out of the ruins, it is quite a lot - of
the Berlin of the eighteenth-century, a gracious, enlightened city. It still
has street after street of single-ends, just like Glaswegian tenements.
The old Jewish quarter looks much as it must have done on the day its hapless
denizens were deported en masse in 1941; amazingly, its golden-domed synagogue
has survived. The dingy greyness by day, the dim yellow light by night, have
you ready to run into George Smiley at any time.
All this makes it a huge adventure playground for the western avant-garde.
Oviform shopping centre, elliptical skyscrapers, rise from the no man's land
where the Wall once ran, obliterating the last few lumps of concrete which mark
the entrance to Adolf Hitler's bunker. Meanwhile, all the most fashionable
restaurants, all the most swinging night-spots, all the most frenetic discos
are to be found in the mean streets of East Berlin.
There is another analogy with Glasgow, with the Glasgow of the 1980s, a city
consciously turning its back on its failures, embracing and being embraced by
the global economy. A mere change of heart does not, of course, suffice to
solve all the long-term problems. Still, it is a good start. One astounding
fact about Berlin is that unemployment in the eastern half is now lower than in
the western half.
Perhaps that is why some genuine working-class districts of East Berlin are, if
anything, dominated by the party of the right and senior partner in the federal
government, the Christian Democrats. But then there were not that many genuine
working-class districts in East Berlin.
It may have been the capital of a proletarian state, but it was itself a city
of the privileged, of an elite gathered round the wellsprings of power in a
highly centralised system. As the system began to collapse and protests took to
the streets down in industrial Saxony - which does have a genuine working class
- the first slogan they put on their banners was ``Away with privilege. We are
the people''.
The privileged, the functionaries of every kind in their communist apparatus,
naturally resent losing their privileges, though for most this means no more
than finding something to fill their time in retirement on an adequate, though
by no means princely, pension. Like nearly all East Germans, they will have
swopped their stinking, chugging Trabi for at least a Volkswagen, if they are
lucky, or extravagant, perhaps for a BMW. Otherwise, many nurse a stubborn
refusal to concede that Germany is a better place since 1990.
This is the basic reason why the old East German Communist Party, renamed the
Party of Democratic Socialism, has been able to survive, even to flourish to
some extent.
It has comfortably fulfilled the qualifications for representation of the
Bundestag. In some future hung Bundestag, it might even exert a decisive
influence, though its attitude towards the other parties leans to the sour. At
the local level, it still has more members than all of them together in united
Berlin.
Since those others have come out of the West Germany tradition, where the
duties of membership do not go far beyond giving money, memories of
revolutionary militancy serve the communists well. At least they will, as their
rivals will not, tramp around knocking on doors, canvassing for their
candidates and encouraging people to join them. They have no reason to be
dissatisfied with the results. Their vote has been rising and they now provide
mayors for three of Berlin's 22 boroughs.
In its internal affairs, too, the party has become positively dynamic, with
factions ranging from the Stalinist to the libertarian. As with the British
Conservatives, much of the leadership's time is taken up with suppressing, or
at least controlling, these freelance activities. But at least the Tories are
in power, whereas the East German communists will by definition never hold
power again.
So why be a communist? A visitor gets the impression that it is almost a matter
of sentiment rather than of any serious political purpose. Once the new Berlin
arises, it will have beneath its glittering futuristic facade a heritage of
extraordinary richness too, including evidences of what people elsewhere do not
care to think much about, the capacity of states for totalitarianism and
terror. Berlin has survived them.
If some of its people still vote communist just because they have been
consigned to the dustbin of history, the rest of us may look on with equanimity.

<HEADLINE>Psychiatrist tells court of accused's watching his `dark side' carry out attack Classroom `killer mentally ill'</HEADLINE>

THE killer of schoolgirl Nikki Conroy was yesterday described as ``very
seriously mentally ill'' by a prosecution psychiatrist who has questioned him
more than 20 times since the classroom attack.
Dr Lawrence Naismith said that after initially being unable to remember
anything about the incident at Hall Garth school, Middlesbrough, Cleveland,
Stephen Wilkinson eventually gave a graphic account of how he witnessed it in
an out-of-body experience.
Wilkinson, 31, explained how his ``dark side'' alter ego, Wilson Jinks, left
his home in his body and he felt compelled to go with him. He explained how he
watched Wilson Jinks carrying out the attack in the classroom and it was only
after two teachers burst in and overpowered the killer that he returned to his
own body, realised he had not been dreaming and that it was he who was being
held down on the floor.
Dr Naismith told Leeds Crown Court his conclusion was that Wilkinson was ``very
seriously mentally ill'' at the time of the attack on March 28 last year.
He was suffering from paranoid psychosis or he would be equally happy to call
it paranoid schizophrenia.
Twelve-year-old Nikki of Ridley Avenue, Middlesbrough, was stabbed after
Wilkinson stormed into the maths lesson and forced the teacher to leave at
gunpoint.
He also plunged knives into Michelle Reeve, 13, and Emma Winter, 12, but they
recovered from their wounds while Nikki died within minutes. One knife thrust
went right through her body.
Wilkinson, of Caversham Road, Middlesbrough, a former pupil at the school when
it was called Boynton Secondary, has denied murdering Nikki but admitted
manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He has also pled
guilty to the attempted murder of Michelle and Emma.
The outrage at Hall Garth was chillingly foretold in a short story, The Tears
Shall Drown the Wind, written by Wilkinson, the court heard.
In the story he said: ``If I had been stronger I would have taken my knife to
these insolent wretches. I would have marched into the classroom and silenced
their tongues forever.''
Wilkinson told Dr Naismith that he fantasised about killing people, although he
denied his violent thoughts involved children.
``I imagine the deaths of young maidens slain in a room choked with desks,'' he
wrote.
He was also interested in the occult, telling a psychiatrist: ``I'm just
satisfied by the dark side of human nature.''
Wilkinson told police that on the night before Nikki's death he was very
depressed and had been drinking whisky and thinking about suicide. After that,
he said there was a ``void'' in his mind until he was arrested.
The jury heard that Wilkinson, who had never had a girlfriend or a sexual
relationship, wanted to commit suicide in public. He told police: ``I wanted to
communicate my despair to the people of Middlesbrough. I wanted them to see my
suffering.''
Referring to Wilkinson's account of the alter ego Wilson Jinks character,
carrying out the killing, the psychiatrist said: ``I cannot recall anything
like this in my experience.''
Wilkinson told him that after he and Wilson Jinks left the house they headed
towards Acklam cemetery. He described walking beside his alter ego all the way
to the classroom and putting a gun to a pupil's head.
Dr Naismith said Wilkinson was describing ``a kind of dissociated process - a
sort of dissociated state in which he perceived himself to be outside his own
body.''
Such concepts had long been associated with schizophrenia, depression and
anxiety. It has also been linked with alcoholism and being in a highly-charged
emotional state.
Asked by David Robson QC, prosecuting, what effect this would have had on his
state of mind at the time of the incident, he replied: ``I would take the view
this disorder did substantially diminish his responsibility.''
The trial continues.

Brussels
EUROPE'S planned single currency probably will be called the ``Euro'' when EU
leaders gather later this week for the Madrid summit.
The name is top of the list of possibilities, not because it is popular but
because no-one has been able to come up with a better suggestion.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke earlier this year suggested names including the
crown, florin and shilling. However, the British voice is unlikely to carry
much weight in the debate because of the Government's right to opt out of the
single currency if it so wishes.
Most recently, the Italians mischievously suggested the Franco but this was
vetoed by the Spanish socialist Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, who will chair
the talks.
Only France is left still calling for the new money to be called the Ecu, after
the old French coin.
Other names include the mark, which is supported by the Germans and the Finns
(whose currency is the markke) but it is not favoured by other nations, fearful
of German economic domination.
British officials yesterday suggested the Euro might be adopted along with a
suffix for each country to denote existing national currencies - like the
Europound or the Eurofranc. That way, public doubts about the new money could
be assuaged.

AMONG a plethora of festive concerts being staged around now, there is one that
merits special attention. Next Sunday, at Killearn Kirk in Stirlingshire, the
Scottish Bach Consort will give a concert entitled A Baroque Christmas that
will fulfil a triple ambition of the small orchestra's leader and founder, John
Doig.
Doig, a well-known violinist on the Scottish music scene, is the leader of the
Orchestra of Scottish Opera and a former co-leader of the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra. Last year, he founded the Scottish Bach Consort out of a number of
convictions.
Principal among these was the awareness that, despite the touring programmes of
orchestras and groups such as the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the BT
Scottish Ensemble, there are still vast areas of Scotland - and not in the
hinterland either - which are seldom, if ever, visited by professional musical
ensembles.
``Basically, I am talking about taking music into rural areas - and I mean
rural - where there are villages with beautiful churches and wonderful
acoustics that are just not visited at all,'' said Doig. The violinist, himself
a resident of Killearn, had realised some years back that villages such as his
own contain a large number of concert-goers who have to travel to one of the
key centres in the central belt for their regular musical fix.
And thus was the idea born of a small orchestra of professional musicians,
which would not operate in the main centres, or compete with the existing major
organisations, but which would specialise in taking music into rural areas.
But that was only part of Doig's ambition. Additionally, he was aware of the
large number of choral societies that operate in these areas. The practice is,
generally, that when these societies stage a large-scale choral work requiring
orchestral resources, an ad hoc orchestra is recruited for the occasion.
Doig's vision was that the Scottish Bach Consort, formed around a tight core of
12 string players and harpsichord, would be available, as an integrated unit
capable of expansion when required, to service the needs of rural choral
societies ``providing a professional orchestra of a very high standard, and at
good rates''.
Of some 14 concerts in its first year of operation, a number of these have
involved local choral societies, such as Stirling's Rosenethe Singers,
Killearn's own Strathendrick Singers, and Crieff Choral Society.
And Doig's experience of the first year of the Scottish Bach Consort has only
firmed his conviction about a need to be met. ``If you marry the music to the
acoustic of these fine buildings and churches, and if you use the locality and
get it right, there are rewards.''
THE rewards, he said, are the numbers in the audiences. ``Every concert we do
is sold out; the problem of declining audiences that we hear about all the time
is just not true in rural areas. In fact, the reverse is true; there's an
upward move.'' And the rewards also include the group's first sponsor,
Independent Pension Trustees plc, like the Consort, based in Killearn and
specialising in services to rural areas.
However, it is the third aspect of Doig's ambition for the Consort - and the
one most personal to him - that brings the particular interest to his group's
concert next Sunday. Doig's own experience as a young musician on the edge of
the profession - which he describes as ``very fortunate'' - convinced him the
only way to learn the ropes of playing in an orchestra was not by being
closeted in the practice room of an academy, but by sitting beside seasoned
professionals in an orchestra.
By the age of 17, Helensburgh-born Doig was playing in the BBC Symphony
Orchestra in London. ``It proved to me that the younger you can get into the
profession the better; not with big-time ideas, but just to learn your craft on
the shop floor.''
In the Scottish Bach Consort, then, Doig runs what he describes as ``loosely, a
sort of apprenticeship scheme, where young talented musicians play beside the
pros''. And next Sunday, four of them get the chance to step into the limelight
in a performance of Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The Seasons is probably the best known work in the entire repertoire. While it
usually features a single violin soloist, it is, in fact, comprised of four
separate violin concertos. Four young violinists who have all played in the
Consort - Elaine Clark, Alison Dixon, Jane Sidebottom, and Louise Webster -
will share the solo parts in one concerto each.
All four are already establishing a pedigree. Aberdeen-born Clark, aged 22, is
a competition prize-winner, and now studies abroad. Alison Dixon, 21, Jane
Sidebottom and Louise Webster, both 20, have, between them, appeared in almost
all of the professional Scottish orchestras.
``Bringing the four of them to the front as soloists is a new venture for us,''
said Doig. ``This is their night.''

<HEADLINE>Excellent returns as demand exceeds supply Deer industry eager for new recruits</HEADLINE>

MAINSTREAM livestock producers who may be beset with worries about sheep quotas
or cattle premiums should consider adapting their skills to deer farming, it
was suggested yesterday.
The British Deer Farmers' Association is anxious to win more converts to the
industry as, for the first time, demand for farmed venison exceeds supply. The
association has 180 members, many of whom are having to turn away business.
``That is a real problem for the industry - we could become vulnerable,'' said
Hugh Fullerton-Smith, association chairman, at a deer farm open day at Barony
College near Dumfries.
More than 60 people attended the event which included a tour of the college's
own deer unit.
Most members of the association are former sheep or cattle farmers and part of
its strategy is to persuade them that deer can be integrated into their other
farming operations.
Dr John Fletcher of Reediehill Deer Farm, Auchtermuchty, who has been farming
them for 25 years, reassured visitors at the open day that they would not be
venturing into the unknown. A lot was known about the care of red deer, he
said. The Moredun Institute in Edinburgh was a world centre of expertise on
their health.
With the creation of Scottish Farm Venision as a marketing co-op there was an
efficient arrangement for selling produce, he added.
Dr Fletcher cautioned, however, against thinking: ``Here is some rough land at
the top of the hill, I will put some deer on it.'' A more likely prospect, he
suggested, was the conversion of a dairy farm which could produce good quality
grass. ``The reason deer live at the top of the hill in the Highlands is that
if they come down people shoot them,'' he said.
The chairman of Scottish Farm Venison, Russell Marchant, vice-principal of
Barony College, said the college had shown that deer farming could be run as a
low-labour enterprise. ``We run beef and sheep herds here and we have not been
involved in any extra labour because of deer,'' he said.
Among the advantages he listed was the fact that venison was not subject to
European Union price fixing and could provide a viable enterprise without aid
from the CAP. He produced figures showing that a gross margin of #459 a hectare
could be achieved by a breeder/finisher, #214 for a store calf producer and
#392 for a finisher.
By comparison, an 18-month beef operation could achieve #515, lowland spring
lamb #339 and upland sheep #342. With subsidies stripped out, the lowland lamb
figure would be #127, the upland #105.
Another advantage, as BSE fever takes a grip, is that deer are not subject to
the disease. Venison also has a healthy image as a low-fat meat.
Alex Bowles, chief executive of the marketing co-op, said the UK market was
growing at 15% a year. Scottish Farm Venison was killing 100 animals a week at
Strathaven, and about 15,000 a year were being slaughtered on a UK basis, he
added.

A DRIVER was convicted yesterday of beating up a disabled motorist in a road
rage attack - because he was travelling too slowly.
Derek Godfrey, 22, savagely assaulted Mr Ian Lothian, 48, kicking him when he
fell to the ground, Falkirk Sheriff Court heard. Godfrey was also found guilty
of careless driving.
Mr Lothian, of Carronshore, Falkirk, said he was driving his wife's Volvo 340
at 25-28mph in a 30mph area in King Street, Stenhousemuir, on July 1 -
displaying his orange disabled sticker on the windscreen.
As he approached a pedestrian crossing Godfrey, of Beaufort Drive, Falkirk,
drove his Volkswagen Golf right up to his bumper.
Mr Lothian said: ``The driver flashed his lights. When I got to the pedestrian
crossing he pulled out and overtook me then cut in sharply in front of me
causing me to brake sharply.
``A car coming the other way had to swerve to avoid running into the Golf.''
Mr Lothian said that further along the road Godfrey stopped and got out his
car. ``He approached the front of my Volvo and started to kick it.''
Mr Lothian, who walks with the aid of a stick since he was invalided out of the
Ministry of Defence with arthritis in 1988, said: ``I asked him to stop kicking
my car and told him to see reason.''
But he claimed Godfrey came at him ``like a boxer leaving his corner for a
fight''.
Mr Lothian, who gave evidence sitting down, told the court Godfrey kicked him
in the arms, legs, groin, and stomach. He said he lay on the ground covering
his head with his hands as Godfrey unleashed his fury.
He said he fought to stay on his feet. ``I knew that if I was down on the
ground I was going to be very vulnerable.''
Mr Lothian said he suffered lacerations to his arms, stomach, legs and arms.
He said his GP suspected his ribs had been cracked or broken and that the
casualty department at Falkirk Royal Infirmary put his arm in a sling.
He said he suffered nightmares after the alleged assault. ``I would wake up in
the night and I was dreaming that I was lying on the ground and that he was
going to kick me.''
However he noted down Godfrey's car registration number as he sped off and
reported the incident to police.
Mr Lothian told the court: ``The only thing I did to annoy him was to drive
within the speed limit. It was a completely unprovoked attack.''
Constable Brian Tennant said Mr Lothian was ``distressed'' when he interviewed
him and his arms and face were grazed. One arm was in a sling and there was
damage to the offside wing of the Volvo.
The policeman said that when he went to Godfrey's home, he told him: ``It is me
that you are looking for.''
He said Godfrey said in a statement: ``As he went down, he gave a wee squeal,
so I gave him a boot.''
Godfrey told the court he acted in self-defence. He claimed Mr Lothian attacked
him.
He claimed Mr Lothian had verbally abused him, and struck him several times on
the neck with his walking stick before he had retaliated.
However, Depute-fiscal Petra Collins told him: ``You were the one with the road
rage.
``You were driving in an appalling manner that day.
``He was going too slowly for you. You took out your anger on him.''
Ms Collins said that, in a statement to police, Godfrey said: ``I deeply regret
hitting him. The whole incident is pretty shameful, considering the man is
disabled.
``I would apologise to the man and I realise it was wrong to fight anyone, I
suppose.
``I'd too much to lose.''
Sheriff Ian Donaldson described Godfrey's behaviour as ``disgraceful'' and
called for reports after hearing that Godfrey had previous convictions for
assault and driving offences. Sentence was deferred until next month.

SCOTTISH Crime Squad detectives worked undercover at a nightspot where drug
dealing was suspected, a court heard yesterday.
They later called in 10 uniformed police - in an operation codenamed Felix - to
raid the Kat House in the Blue Bell Hotel at Lockerbie, and detained 78 people.
Those detained were handcuffed and held in three holding centres at Lockerbie,
Dumfries, and Annan for searches and interviews.
The policeman in charge of the operation, Chief Inspector John McGoldrick, told
a jury at Dumfries Sheriff Court: ``Eight persons were eventually arrested in
connection with allegations of supplying drugs......I think two others were
arrested for being in possession of drugs.''
A quantity of drugs and wraps were recovered throughout the premises as well as
two knives.
Mr McGoldrick was giving evidence at the trial of Mr Ian Gass, 26, of Victoria
Park, Lockerbie, who has pled not guilty to five drugs-related charges.
He denies supplying or offering to supply amphetamine to another person at the
Kat House and possessing amphetamine and ecstasy on August 12 - the day of the
raid.
He also denies being concerned in supplying amphetamine and ecstasy to others
in the nightspot on various occasions last year.
Detective Chief Inspector Tom McCulloch explained that it was decided to
handcuff those detained in the raid to prevent any drugs in their possession
being discarded.
Mr McCulloch added that intelligence had suggested that some of those attending
the Kat House could be violent and had access to knives or firearms.
Detective Constable Veronica Jackson, from the Scottish Crime Squad was
undercover in the nightspot prior to the raid. She told the court that she had
seen Mr Gass approach another man next to a pool table and had seen him take
money and hand over a small flat package.
The trial before Sheriff Kenneth Barr continues.

NOISY neighbours face a #40 on-the-spot fixed penalty if they refuse to comply
with warnings to tone down night-time nuisance, under tough measures announced
by the Government yesterday.
The creation of a new night-time noise offence - between 11pm and 7am, is part
of a package designed to tackle and clarify ways of dealing with the problem of
noise south of the Border..
A Scottish Office spokesman said the new laws would not apply in Scotland -
where police have more powers than their English counterparts under breach of
the peace laws. However, he said the operation of the laws south of the Border
would be monitored to see if any advantages could be applied in Scotland.
Under the new offence - noise such as from a ghetto blaster, discotheque or
live band or machinery - would have to exceed 35 decibels and the background
level by at least 10 decibels when measured in a complainant's house, before
action is taken.

A SPARK from a barbecue and the fury of a woman landed former goalkeeper David
McWilliam in the dock yesterday.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that, as McWilliam cooked a meal over the charcoal
for his girlfriend, a spark landed on her son's arm, causing a minor burn. The
boy's howls, however, fuelled revenge in his mother's heart.
Solicitor-advocate Joe Beltrami said the woman ordered the former Airdrie
footballer out of her Motherwell home, and told him to take his car with him or
she would have it removed. Then she telephoned the police, told them McWilliam
had been drinking, and gave them his home address.
As McWilliam, 43, drove up to his flat in Candleriggs, in Glasgow's Merchant
City, police were waiting for him.
The court was told he initially failed to give a breath test and was taken to
the police station for a test on the Camic machine. This showed that he was
four-and-a-half times the legal limit.
McWilliam yesterday admitted failing to give a breath test and having 154
microgrammes of alcohol in his breath.
Sheriff William Finlayson fined him #250 and banned him from driving for 30
months.
Mr Beltrami said that, had it not been for the spark and the row that followed
it, McWilliam car would have stayed in his girlfriend's driveway for the
weekend.
He added: ``Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. She blamed him for a slight
burn on her son's arm, and couldn't accept it was an accident.''
After the case McWilliam, who won a Cup Final runners-up medal in 1975 when
Airdrie lost to Celtic, refused to name his girlfriend but said: ``To say that
I am devastated at what she did to me is an understatement. I haven't seen her
since and have no intentions to ever see her again.''

THE founder of a Scottish aid charity was made an MBE yesterday in recognition
of his missions to Bosnia.
Dr Denis Rutovitz of Edinburgh Direct Aid was presented with the award at a
ceremony in the city.
Collecting the award from Edinburgh Lord Provost Norman Irons, Dr Rutovitz, 67,
said the medal was a tribute to all the charity's volunteers including
Christine Witcutt who was killed by a sniper's bullet near Sarajevo two years
ago.
He then announced that he would lead the biggest ever EDA convoy to Sarajevo
which leaves Edinburgh on Saturday. He praised Glasgow's Asian business
community for providing much of the clothing to be taken to refugees.
Dr Rutovitz, who was shot in the chest while on a mission to Sarajevo in April,
was named in the Queen's Birthday honours list in May.
Rather than receive the honour at Buckingham Palace, London, he opted to accept
it from Provost Irons with staff from Edinburgh Direct Aid, including Mrs
Witcutt's husband, Alan, 52, at his side.
On receiving the award the retired doctor said the MBE was in recognition of
the work everyone had done with EDA since it started four years ago.
Doctor Rutovitz said: ``This is an honour for everyone involved in the
organisation.''
Mr Witcutt, of Wishaw, Lanarkshire, said he was delighted Dr Rutovitz had
received the honour and was sure his wife would have approved.
q Meanwhile at Buckingham Palace Mrs Sara Jones, the widow of Falklands hero
Colonel H Jones, was invested a CBE by the Queen for her work with veterans'
charities.
The 54-year-old went to the palace in 1982 to collect her husband's posthumous
Victoria Cross.
Actor Alan Bates, 61, was also made a CBE yesterday.

KEN SMITH writes on the divisions that have marked the selection of the Labour
candidate in Govan, where a close result is expected tomorrow
SCOTTISH Labour Party officials are anxious to heal the rift between the two
sides of supporters after the debilitating contest between MP Mike Watson and
Glasgow councillor Mohammed Sarwar to become the party's candidate in the
Glasgow Govan constituency.
Voting among Labour members in Govan began on Monday night when four party
members cast their votes in a secret ballot. The small number of voters is
deceptive, however. There are 568 Labour members in Govan eligible to vote, and
485 of them applied for a postal vote.
The remainder have the opportunity to vote at three constituency meetings this
week, with the last one taking place tonight in Pollokshields.
All the votes, including postal votes received at Labour's Glasgow headquarters
by tomorrow morning will then be counted, with the winner being announced later
in the day.
There are in fact three candidates, but Margaret Curran, a Jordanhill lecturer
and campaigner on women's rights, is being squeezed out by the high-profile
tussle between Mr Watson and Mr Sarwar. Her supporters' votes are not lost
however, as they will then be transferred to their second choice preferences.
In fact, the contest is so close between Mr Watson and Mr Sarwar, that it is Ms
Curran's supporters who may have the final say on which of the two men becomes
Labour's candidate.
The contest has not covered New Labour in glory. There have been constant
claims of dirty tricks. First, it was alleged that retiring Pollok MP Jimmy
Dunnachie threw his hat into the ring to ensure there was a contest, and then
withdrew. He denies he did any deal with Mr Sarwar to do so.
Then there was the claim that Mr Sarwar was being investigated by Customs and
Excise over whether duty had been paid on alcohol his successful chain of
warehouses was selling. However, everything was in order.
There also was an intense scrutiny of membership lists by supporters on both
sides to try to rule out those who were ineligible by not being members for a
year or for not being on the electoral roll. About 40 names were thus removed.
But was this a particularly dirty campaign? Mr Jimmy Allison, retired Scottish
organiser of the Labour Party, said yesterday: ``People say it's the dirtiest
ever, but it's really only the dirtiest since the last one.
``It's always going to be fiercely contested when an MP is fighting for his or
her job as is the case with Mike Watson.''
Both sides are genuinely confident of victory. With a secret ballot, it is
impossible to say who has the upper hand.
However, whoever wins, Labour headquarters is keen that the divisions do not
rumble on. Certainly Mr Watson and Mr Sarwar cannot be regarded as bosom
buddies, although Mr Sarwar helped bring out the ethnic vote when Mr Watson
fought off the big SNP challenge in the Glasgow Central by-election in 1989.
Mr Sarwar said:: ``Mike Watson's view is that he is the sitting MP and that I
should not be challenging him. I could understand his anger and frustration if
he was the sitting MP, but as I've tried to explain to him for 18 months, only
a fifth of the new Govan constituency consists of part of his present
constituency. He is not the sitting MP.''
Certainly defeat would mean that Mr Watson would be out of a job after the next
election as it would be too late to apply to another constituency. It would be
a double family blow as his wife Lorraine works as his secretary, and would
also become unemployed.
Mr Watson is in his early 40s, articulate, passionate, and the type of MP that
Labour should be keen to keep.
His failure to advance to a Front Bench position in the party owes more to his
failure to ``wear out the carpet on the way to Tony Blair's office as others
have done,'' as one activist puts it.
His supporters say that Mohammed Sarwar, owning a multi-million-pound business,
is hardly at the cutting edge of socialism.
Both sides reckon 250 votes should be enough to one. Both sides believe they
have attracted enough support. No-one can say for certain who will succeed.
The Labour Party is probably relaxed about either individual.
What the party does not want is any kind of challenge to the result, or even
worse, some form of court action by the losing side. It would be difficult to
imagine Labour organiser Lesley Quinn, who has supervised the contest, being
anything less than scrupulously fair to both sides, so it is hoped that there
will be no loophole left.
Tomorrow, Labour hopes, will be the final say on Glasgow Govan. Whether the
healing process can be completed by the General Election is another matter.

LEGISLATION to crackdown on carrying knives was announced for England and Wales
last night, following the fatal stabbing of headmaster Philip Lawrence outside
St George's School in London last week.
Home Secretary Michael Howard said the Bill would enable police to arrest
anyone carrying a knife in a public place without good reason and without a
warrant.
The Bill would also increase the maximum penalty specifically for carrying a
knife, other than a small pocket knife, in public from a #1000 fine to a six
month prison sentence.
It will add to existing legislation which already allows a maximum two-year
prison sentence for the offence of carrying an offensive weapon in public
without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.
The legislation is being introduced in the form of a Private Members' Bill
sponsored by the Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam, Lady Olga Maitland, and will
have full Government support.
q.Meanwhile, one in six Scottish schoolchildren questioned in a crime survey
believed that carrying a knife was not a serious offence, it was revealed
yesterday.
The survey findings resulted from a Young Citizens' Crime Conference held in
the summer in Edinburgh.
A total of 17% of about 200 second-year pupils in the 13 to 14-year-old group
from local authority schools across Lothian said they regarded carrying a knife
or other weapon as ``not very or not at all serious''.
The results of a questionnaire carried out at the event at New Parliament House
were published yesterday at Currie High School, on the outskirts of Edinburgh.
Councillor Marilyne MacLaren, a member of Lothian and Borders Police Board,
said the London tragedy had highlighted ``the violence around us in society''.
She said it was a valuable reference of young people's attitudes to crime, and
hoped that it would be taken notice of by authorities south of the Border.
Inspector Adam Conn, of Lothian and Borders police's community services
department, said the figure of 17% who felt knife-carrying was not serious was
very concerning.
The police had to try even harder to get the message across about the tragic
consequences of possessing a weapon.
He said the police would be studying the results carefully, and future
education on the dangers of knife-carrying would be looked at.
The survey showed that sexual offences were regarded by both male and female
participants as most serious, while vandalism was rated as the least serious
crime.
Councillor MacLaren said the majority of young people were law-abiding and
responsible and it was crucially important to tap into young teenagers'
knowledge and perceptions to reduce crime.

THE SNP yesterday launched a counter-argument to the ``tartan tax,'' claiming
that the Government had cost firms north of the Border a fortune in extra
taxation.
The party said that Scotland should forget about a tax that might never happen
and concentrate on the ``London levy'' which had cost Scottish business #1.5bn
during the nineties.
During the first five years of the decade firms in Scotland paid #1.2bn extra
in business rates, but Government moves to close that gap in poundage had left
an existing gap in valuation, because of different systems north and south of
the Border.
``What is Michael Forsyth doing about it?'' said SNP party business spokesman
Fergus Ewing.
``The Tories are quick to scaremonger about tax but slow to acknowledge and
address the London levy that Scottish business pays within the Union.''

THEY say it's always a famine or a feast - and that success breeds success.
Adrian Wiszniewski is currently run off his feet with almost more commissions
that he can handle. First there's a triple portrait for the Scottish National
Gallery - to be unveiled on Friday. He's painted all three directors, Giles
Havergal, Philip Prowse, and Robert MacDonald, to celebrate the Citizens'
Theatre's fiftieth birthday. The portrait is as punchy and uncompromising as
the productions there, with the trio closely grouped and set against a
patchwork of bright emerald, yellow, red, orange and black.
Then there are two huge pictures for Liverpool Cathedral commissioned by the
Jerusalem Trust: The Good Samaritan and The House Built Upon Rock. These will
hang in the nave and be dedicated on Easter Sunday.
Another big on-going project is for Cleveland's 1996 UK Year of Visual Arts
where he's been commissioned to produce a whole package of five permanent
public art works ranging from 12 large-scale banner-flags for Middlesbrough to
an outdoor mosaic, painted cut-steel frieze and seating area plus a 60ft
Formica gable end for the city centre Odeon cinema and portable neon lighting
for various sites including swimming baths. Cleveland is being treated to one
of his best ploys: a garden of roses designed to spell out SEX. ``It's a
sculptural thing made out of real roses. It'll grow to 10ft tall. It's a maze
to wander in, think about goings on in the bushes - and smell the flowers
before entering the Middlesbrough Art Gallery,'' he explains.
Glasgow also celebrates the UK's 1996 Year of Visual Arts, (despite the fact
that the city lost) and Wiszniewski has been invited to paint the entire top
floor of the new Gallery of Modern Art in Exchange Square. ``It began as two
rooms, but now it's going to be one big function room cum cafe/restaurant, with
about six walls. I get to OK the colour of the carpet too. The architect is
enthusiastic, so I'm sure I'll enjoy myself.'' Before he settled for painting,
Wiszniewski spent three years training as an architect. It's all proved very
useful.
Meanwhile he's just completed his Glasgow Royal Concert Hall mural (of a
quartet of young musicians playing imaginary instruments), book illustrations
for George Mackay Brown's new short story, The Sixth Station, to be published
by Clarion in the next couple of weeks, and, practically overnight, produced a
huge 10ft picture for the London launch of Glasgow City of Visual Arts 1996,
``A fun piece!''
And he's scooped the plum exhibition at next year's Edinburgh Festival with a
solo show at the Talbot Rice (following Bellany and Campbell) which will then
be toured by his Belgian dealer, Gallery F17, to Holland, Germany, Brussells,
Vienna and Japan. ``We are very positive about Adrian's work. He's always ready
to experiment,'' they tell me.
There are spin-offs to this hyper-activity. Wiszniewski banners will also
feature in Central Station next year while the designs for the banners are
being made into screenprints in collaboration with Glasgow Print Studio and
North Shields Print Studio. The prints, together with preliminary Cleveland
drawings, will form an exhibition for Middlesbrough and perhaps Glasgow's 1999
Architecture and Design Gallery in Princes Square.
``But nothing's definite until it's up on the walls. I always wait until the
first cheque comes through; then you know they are serious!''
So does he have a team of helpers; a smooth running workshop; a bevy of
assistants? ``You must be joking! I work at home. On my own. My studio used to
be a byre. We have three kids aged from two to eight. Sometimes it's like a
fairground. I have all these wonderful drawing pens and then I find they're
bashed - the kids have used them for colouring in. The shelves I store my
things on get higher and higher. Kids! But they're great really.''
Louis, Holly, and Max are in fact the apples of Wiszniewski's eye. He's a
wonderful father - something that might surprise those who knew him in his
younger, wilder days. He does more than his share of looking after them with
equanimity, a fact his wife Diane takes in her stride.
Happily Wiszniewski is a fast mover and likes deadlines. The Citizens' portrait
was finished at 4am in time for collection and framing at 10am. I watched its
progress over eight weeks, interspersed with other commissions, starting with
the day he began in a makeshift studio above the Glasgow Print Studio where
each sitter came separately on consecutive days. He began with small, speedy
studies from the life and then sketched in the poses on his 8ft canvas. It's
changed a good deal since then - not so much an evolution as a fast about turn.
Originally Wiszniewski envisaged the three sitters in classical mode, Havergal,
the intellectual heavyweight who has just won t
The commission is the brain-child of Duncan Thompson and James Holloway of the
SNPG. ``James came to see the portrait a fortnight ago when it was
landscape-ish and loved it. But I didn't like it so I painted it all out five
minutes after he was out the door. I drew sections right across it, aligning
the centre division with the cube Philip sits on. James will get a fright at
the unveiling when he sees how it's changed. It was a delicate game to get it
right but I wanted something colourful and strong.''
So how does he juggle all these balls in the air and remain so easy-going and
laid back. Does he never get stressed? ``No. I quite enjoy it all. It's good
fun.'' Of all the artists I know, Wiszniewski is the one most ready to
contribute to Scotland's general artistic community. He's been on the
exhibitions committee of Edinburgh's Fruitmarket and Glasgow Print Studio,
making sure younger, conceptual artists get a foot in the door. His stylistic
interests are broad. His latest idea, for artist designed wallpaper,
(ultimately for sale as limited editions) has attracted funding from Glasgow's
1996 Fund.
His Good Samaritan painting for Liverpool exemplifies Wiszniewski's strengths,
and his ability to make painting relevant to today. He's updated the entire
scene, making the Good Samaritan into a young woman of the 1990s who aids a
victim of a street stabbing, while yuppies exchange their business cards and a
dapper youth, Italian jacket slung casually over the shoulder, looks the other
way. The huge 11ft canvas contains six figures in a complex composition where
the light from a house makes a central, critical, cross of golden light on
black shadow, and a wall shaped like a bolt of lightning acts as a reference to
tragedy which comes at us out of the blue and a support to the Christ-like stab
victim with the gash in his side.
An allegory of The House Built Upon Rock will show a family at the seaside with
a serpentine sand snake, sand-castles, buckets and spades. ``We took the kids
to St Ives. That's where I got the idea.'' Liverpool Cathedral gets 6,000,000
visitors a year so both he and the clergy want the picture to be easily
understood.
``I don't do things just for one reason. I'm using the parable as a premonition
of Christ's crucifixion. The woman, dressed in blue like one of the three
Marys, is giving the victim water in a chalice as though giving communion. The
blood is shaped like a heart while the incriminating Swiss army knife (which
has a white cross on it) points at the bystanders soundlessly accusing them of
their indifference.
`'The business cards represent the mock friendships of today. The victim's
jacket on the ground is orangey red, like the Robe - remember the film with
Richard Burton? - that the Roman soldiers played dice for. The second girl
bystander doesn't run to help but does hold on to her handbag. The Italian
youth is going to walk on by - like the song. They say the sky went dark at the
Crucifixion, a solar eclipse, so I've painted it black. There's a palm tree to
locate the scene. The colours are bright, like stained glass, because it'll be
hung 10ft off the ground. All the work went into balancing the colours. It's
like the Rubic cube. Change one; you change them all.''
I left Wiszniewski to tackle juggling his next big job. But which one would it
be? Characteristically he took the easy option. ``I think now I'll get the tea
on,'' announced Scotland's Renaissance family man.
Artist Adrian Wiszniewski is like a whirlwind of activity as he breezes through
major commissions. Clare Henry views recent works, including the Citizens'
fiftieth anniversary portrait

MUSICIAN Pollyanna Peate told a jury yesterday how her lover warned her to
abandon him and ``run like hell'' if he should die during one of their illicit
sex sessions in the back of his car.
The 34-year-old mother of two told Chester Crown Court she would regularly have
sex with grandfather Brian Phillips, 62, after they left rehearsal sessions
with the Frodsham Silver Band.
Euphonium player Mrs Peate, 34, of Runcorn, Cheshire, denies the manslaughter
of bass trombonist Mr Phillips on November 15, 1994.
The prosecution says the couple's 10-year love affair was an ``open secret''
among colleagues in the Frodsham Silver Band, but both had managed to keep it a
secret from their marital partners.
It is alleged Mrs Peate attacked him, striking him at least four times, after
he tried to end their affair.
Mr Phillips, who had a weak heart after suffering a coronary attack in 1972,
died of a heart attack as a result.
Mrs Peate told the court she met Mr Phillips 10 years ago. She had begun a
romantic attachment with him soon afterwards.
She said: ``The first time I had sex with him was at the marshes, in the back
of his car, nearly 10 years ago.
``We would go to the marshes after band practice basically every Monday and
Tuesday, when we went to rehearsals. We wouldn't always have sexual
intercourse.''
She said the affair halted for six months five years ago when she left the band
for a time, and she confirmed that she knew from the start that he had a bad
heart.
Mr Benjamin Nolan QC, defending, asked Mrs Peate: ``Did he speak to you about
the possibility of his heart failing when he was with you?''
She agreed that he had spoken about it regularly, from the beginning of their
relationship.
``He said if he was ever to die in my company to leave him, take money for a
taxi and don't say a word - run like hell and just get home. He didn't really
want his wife to find out and I didn't want Graham to find out.''
Mr Nolan asked: ``Did you ever argue with that?''
She replied: ``I did at one stage say I could never do that to him. He said if
you love me you will carry out what I ask.''
She said that when they had sex he would cough, sometimes before they had
finished, and began becoming breathless.
Mrs Peate confirmed that he would use a spray he had for his heart condition
before they had sex.
Earlier the court heard transcripts of a police interview in which Mrs Peate
described how she made love to Mr Phillips that night.
``He was passionate for a while - then he collapsed on me,'' she told
detectives.
``He went with his full body weight on me. His head fell forward and he went
totally flat. He fell right on top of me.''
She then described desperate struggles to get from underneath him and try to
revive him as he made gurgling noises.
She had hit his back, slapped him and tried breathing into his mouth, and at
one point his head dropped after she lifted it up and she thought she had hurt
him.
Finally she had struggled to put his trousers back on, taken some money from
his pocket, tidied her hair, took her euphonium from the car and walked back
into Frodsham to catch a taxi home. She had not been aware of the injuries to
his head.
The hearing continues.

LEONARD Friedman, founder of the Scottish Baroque Ensemble, would have been 65
this week. In his memory, friends and fellow-musicians gathered at the Scottish
Arts Club to play music associated with him, interspersed with spoken tributes
and readings from his letters.
Music in intimate surroundings, with performers and audience in close contact,
formed an important part of Leonard's life, and this recital - featuring solo
Scottish violin music, a Handel trio sonata, some Prokofiev, and some of the
salon pieces he so adored - was just the sort in which he himself participated
many times.
No violinist has commissioned more Scottish music than Friedman, though born in
London, of Lithuanian ancestry, he made Scotland the fulcrum of his career, and
Mendelssohn on Mull Festival, his last venture, has continued as his memorial.
Next year's, featuring the usual array of master classes, workshops, and first
performances, opens on June 26.
The Scottish music with which Christopher Field launched Monday's recital was
Macpherson's Lament - not a commissioned work, but one of the grandest of
traditional pibrochs, which developed in the manner of one of Bach's slow
sonata movements, to a peak of solemn intensity before reaching its simple
close.
Handel's G Minor sonata, too, was moving. Here, Field was joined by Daphne
Godson and Gillian Thomas, former members of the SBE, with Leon Coates as
harpsichordist. The welling, overlapping melodies were savoured
Friedman-fashion, the faster music vivaciously expounded.
The first movement of the second of Prokofiev's violin sonatas, in its original
version for flute, introduced a young player, Anna Higgins, of the quality
Leonard constantly searched for and was delighted whenever he found it.
This witty, angular music, sweetly played, lightened the mood of the evening,
paving the way for Dvorak and a spot of Scott Joplin.

TOWARDS the end of last month Mr Rupert Murdoch, that darling man, delivered a
speech in Boston, Massachusetts, to the 250 members of something called the
``Chief Executives Club''. Inter alia, as the lawyers say, Rupe announced plans
to launch upon the world a 24-hour, ``all news'' TV network.
This, the American-Australian told his wholly representative audience, would
provide a corrective to Ted Turner's CNN. ``We think it is about time CNN is
challenged'', Murdoch said.
And for why? Cable News Network, explained the mogul, is moving ``further and
further to the left''. Murdoch thought - or said he thought - that ``it's time
to form a really objective news channel''.
``I don't know whether it happened with my friend Ted marrying Jane Fonda or
giving up lithium,'' the droll continued, ``but, one thing or another, CNN has
changed very greatly in the last couple of years.''
Think about this for a moment. Ted Turner, raving left-winger? CNN, the patriot
missile of television's own Gulf war, ``too liberal''? America, the state that
clubbed, imprisoned, exiled, or electrocuted most of its socialists decades ago
- and eradicated the very idea of pluralism - standing in need of ``objective
news''?
It is a familiar Murdoch technique, first developed in Australia and honed on
the hapless BBC in Britain during the eighties: conflate ``news'' and the
right's agenda, smear the competition, and deploy your own very considerable
resources to ensure that people like ``the Chief Executives Club'' understand
that you, a very humble entrepreneur, understand their needs only too well.
This episode is not, in itself, so very shocking, at least when compared with
some of Rupe's previous escapades. His ruthlessness is legendary, his cynicism
matchless. The mystery of what he actually wants aside, there is nothing new in
this latest outburst.
But consider what Murdoch actually means by ``news''. After all, he is probably
the globe's chief purveyor of that commodity. Much of what you read, hear, and
see in the way of information and comment passes through the hands of one of
his lieutenants. What you or I actually know about most events depends, one way
or another, on what a born-again, right-wing multi-millionaire whose concept of
national loyalty is slight happens to think on a given day.
Now the man who pulled the BBC's World Service from his Asian satellite service
to please China's geriatric ruling class offers America - and by extension the
world - ``objective'' news. While Britain grows fretful over his grip on
sporting events, Murdoch is moving to take control, quite simply, over what we
know.
Melodramatic? Rupert doesn't tell you what to think: of course not. He does not
interfere with the freedom of the media: he's a democrat, after all. Murdoch is
the champion of absolute freedom of choice - much as Henry Ford was the
champion of free choice in the colour of Model Ts. The blank-eyed mogul
wouldn't hurt a fly.
But the real point of the Murdoch enterprise is different. On the principle
that what you don't know won't hurt you, he is taking control over the
well-springs of debate. Like the tree that falls unheard in the forest, a story
unreported by Citizen Rupert is a story that never happened. A political debate
ignored is a political debate neutralised.
And so it goes. Even now, the political culture of Britain remains the product
of the unholy bargain struck by the Murdoch press and the Reaganite/Thatcherite
right in the eighties. Tony Blair's remodelling of Labour was only possible,
for example, because Murdoch's mouthpieces suppressed all alternatives. Real
dissent has all but ceased to exist in the nineties simply because it has been
choked off - amid a plethora of media ``choice'' - at source.
This isn't good for any country, but it is worse for the portion of the world
that likes to call itself free. Murdoch's attitude is contagious; fear, awe,
and envy of his power have run through the global media like a grotesque virus.
Political debate, such as it ever was, has been eradicated. Capital's
contending factions squabble but real challenges to the world order are
rendered invisible - and therefore safe.
The Gospel According to Rupert: globally, continuously, endlessly . . . The
deep, cruel irony is that most of us, grazing on Sky, basking in the Sun,
pumped full of 24-hours ``news'', will never know what is really going on with
the sources of our knowledge, or why. Murdoch will make sure of that.

A NURSE who admitted stealing #1515 belonging to patients at Lennox Castle
Hospital was struck off the register by the professional conduct committee of
the UK Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting in Edinburgh
yesterday.
Mrs Margaret Main Brady admitted three charges of misconduct while she was
employed by Greater Glasgow Health Board as an enrolled nurse at the hospital
in Lennoxtown, near Glasgow.
She admitted misappropriating #1515 of patients' funds by six unauthorised
withdrawals between October 5 and December 30, 1992, attempting to
misappropriate a further #354 of patients' funds on January 25, 1993, and
forging the signatures of four nurses and two managers in furtherance of the
two earlier offences.
Mr Ian Balfour, solicitor for the council, said Mrs Brady had worked at Lennox
Castle from 1988 until Febuary, 1993. Patients who needed money arranged
through a nurse to obtain it from the hospital cashier, and this was done with
counter-signatures by another nurse and a senior nurse.
In six cases, Mrs Brady had signed the cashier's book but the transactions were
not recorded in the ward cash book.
The offences came to light after an audit in January, 1993, and she was
dismissed on February 10. Mr Dave Watson, regional officer for Unison Scotland,
for Mrs Brady, asked the council to accept that her offences were isolated and
uncharacteristic.
At the time of the offence, Mrs Brady had been under considerable stress
because one of her children was ill and her husband had left her.
Mr Watson said Mrs Brady had 11 years of exemplary service as an enrolled nurse
before this incident, and she had a good work record since.
After a recess of 55 minutes, Mrs Elizabeth Rush, chairman, said it had been
decided to remove Mrs Brady's name from the register with immediate effect.
Mrs Brady made no comment as she left the hearing.

A GRAMPIAN policeman yesterday denied being the source of information allegedly
given to a drugs baron for cash.
Constable James Grimmer, 35 - currently under suspension - told the High Court
in Aberdeen he did not pass police intelligence to Ronald Cormack in exchange
for more than #6000.
He was giving evidence at the trial of Grampian colleague Constable Neil
Cooper, 36, who denies one charge of corruption and two of attempting to defeat
the ends of justice.
Mr Cooper, of Springdale Crescent, Bieldside, Aberdeen, is alleged to have
received the money from Cormack - who is serving 15 years for drugs and
firearms offences - in return for drugs intelligence.
Mr Cooper has lodged a special defence incriminating Mr Grimmer. Asked by
Advocate-depute Alan Turnbull if there was any substance to this incrimination,
Mr Grimmer replied: ``None whatsoever.''
Mr Turnbull then asked Mr Grimmer what he felt when he found out about the
allegation made against him by Mr Cooper.
Mr Grimmer said: ``I was shattered. I just could not believe that he had done
that.''
Later he claimed he and Mr Cooper had discussed the matter in October of this
year at Mr Cooper's house.
``He said he knew that I had nothing to do with the money. He said don't worry
I know you have got nothing to do with taking money,'' Mr Grimmer told the
court.
It was also disclosed that Mr Grimmer had been suspended in January this year
after being arrested along with Mr Cooper and two other officers, and that he
faces separate charges of reset of stolen property and possession of cannabis.
Mr Grimmer said he was friendly with Mr Cooper and had known him since they
were posted to the same police department in 1981.
He said it was information he had received from an informant about Cormack
which set off the inquiry which led to the drug baron's arrest and conviction.
Mr Grimmer said he had never met Cormack and denied passing information either
to him or his associates.
Defence counsel, Mr Kevin Drummond, QC, said he would not be leading any
evidence and both sides retired to prepare their summing up.
The trial, before Judge Lord Macfadyen, continues.

THE Lord Advocate is to publish guidelines on pitch violence to assist the
police in deciding which offences should be reported to procurators-fiscal. He
is to meet Scotland's chief constables to gather their views.
Mr Donald Mackay QC, the new Lord Advocate - he becomes Lord Mackay today -
yesterday met the all-party Scottish Sports Group of MPs to hear their concerns
following recent clashes at football grounds.
The MPs demanded action to avoid the inconsistencies which they claim have
marked the official response to recent football incidents. They claim
procurators-fiscal have chosen to prosecute for some offences, but not others.
The guidelines, which will be published, will mirror the unofficial ones
currently used by procurators-fiscal in assessing whether an on-pitch incident
warrants prosecution. These are:
q.The seriousness of the offence and whether it causes injury.
q.Whether the offender has any previous convictions.
q.Whether the incident is likely to provoke further violence on the pitch or
among the spectators.
The delegation - which included former Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector
Munro, Labour Front Bench spokesmen John McFall and John McAllion, and Paisley
North MP Irene Adams - was led by Falkirk West MP Dennis Canavan.
Mr Canavan said: ``We realise that players cannot be given immunity from
prosecution just because they are on a football or rugby pitch. We also
condemned the level of violence in sport and emphasised the need for clubs and
the governing bodies of sport to be seen to be taking firm disciplinary action
against players who resort to violence.
``However, there has been concern expressed about apparent inconsistencies in
the decisions of procurators-fiscal as to whether or not to prosecute in
certain cases. We therefore urged the Lord Advocate to issue guidelines which
would help to clarify this matter and hopefully avoid such inconsistencies in
the future.''
A Crown Office spokesman said the meeting had been helpful. ``The MPs accepted
that from time to time it was appropriate for legal authorities to take action
and recognise that the best evidence available should be used, such as video
footage,'' he said.
``We agreed with the MPs that we would be looking to the sporting bodies at
both association and club level to take prompt and effective action in dealing
with incidences of sporting violence.
``We confirm that we will be holding discussions with chief constables with a
view to issuing guidance to the police, and that it should be made public.''
Political concern was raised by the case of Duncan Ferguson, of Everton, and
formerly Rangers, who recently served 44 days in Barlinnie prison over injuries
sustained by Raith Rovers defender John McStay at a match in April 1994.
He has returned to Premiership football pending a court hearing on the merits
of his 12-match suspension imposed by the Scottish Football Association.

POLICE marksmen who surrounded a house in a quiet suburban street during an
armed siege in August showed remarkable restraint by refraining from shooting
the man at the centre of the drama, a court was told yesterday.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard how the incident was so serious there was a real
danger of David Kerr being shot as, armed with a handgun, he threatened to kill
police and blow up his parents' home.
Kerr, 30, turned on all the gas appliances in the house in Drumby Crescent,
Clarkston, and said he would blow up the property.
A tactical firearms unit from Strathclyde Police was sent to the house.
The three-hour drama ended when a skilled negotiator was brought in and Kerr
surrendered.
The court heard how armed police later revealed that Kerr was lucky he wasn't
shot by marksmen.
Depute-fiscal Shona Cook said: ``The situation was so serious that it was
fortunate the officers refrained from shooting him. There was a real danger he
could have been shot.''
Kerr, who has been detained in the Carstairs institution since September to
await his court appearance, admitted unlawful possession of a 7mm revolver,
threatening police officers in the execution of their duty, breach of the
peace, and causing malicious damage to the house.
The court heard how the accused had taken an accidental overdose of
prescription drugs some months prior to the incident while living in England,
and had lapsed into a coma.
His recovery, although described as remarkable, had left him with residual
damage.
He returned to Scotland to live with his parents, who had been trying in vain
to get specialist medical care for him.
On the day in question last August, he had an argument with his mother and she
left the house for help. Minutes later, Kerr shouted out that he had knives and
guns and would use them.
When armed police took up positions, they saw Kerr pointing a handgun in their
direction. They could smell gas coming from the house and saw Kerr was holding
a box of matches.
Neighbours were evacuated when he threatened to blow up the house, and Scottish
Gas workmen were called to cut off supplies to the area while police tried to
calm Kerr.
The court was told the handgun was a vintage weapon which could not have been
used.
Two psychiatric reports from Carstairs indicated that Kerr required a further
period of examination.
Sheriff Colin Higgins imposed an interim hospital order committing Kerr to
Carstairs for a further three months.
He was ordered to return to court on March 5 for updated reports to be
presented.

THE Prime Minister politely thanked his old friend and fellow Chelsea supporter
Mr Tony Banks (Newham North-West - Lab.) for a pleasant social occasion spent
with him recently.
Mr George Foulkes (Carrick. Cumnock and Doon Valley) and Mr Alan Simpson
(Nottingham South) sitting on either side of Mr Banks, ostentatiously edged
away from this Major chum.
The real mystery surrounding the Major-Banks relationship is why two
south-of-the-river boys do not support Crystal Palace. Perhaps something for
the Snobbery in Sport Commission to investigate.
But this outbreak of politeness and goodwill was a cheering diversion from Mr
Major's perpetual efforts to indict New Labour as the unconvincing PR version
of Old Labour.
Mr Blair made the point which seems right as, amid all his indicting, Mr Major
did not get round to denying it, that Government subsidy to the railways
actually will be going up after privatisation.
When Mr Major tried the one about all privatisations turning out great after
being sneered at by Labour, Mr Blair smartly rejoined ``tell that to the
customers of Yorkshire Water''.
Unfortunately, bang on cue Mr Graham Riddick (Colne Valley - Con.) rose with
the decidedly unhelpful request that Mr Major's Government do everything it
could to stop Yorkshire Water cutting off supplies to customers on a rota basis.
Mr Major gave him the undertaking between clenched teeth and moved on to
receive the much more acceptable observation from Miss Jacqui Lait (Hastings
and Rye - Con.) that every Labour MEP had signed a message of support for the
striking French unions who look like doing to Messrs Chirac and Juppe what
their once-mighty British brothers and sisters did to Mr Callaghan.
Did the support not show that ``Labour is still the strikers' friend?'' crowed
Miss Lait.
Mr Major capped this showing that some head at Tory Central Office remains cool
enough to go through the papers each morning.
Not just these unreconstructed exiles in Brussels-Strasbourg, but some nearer
home were perpetrating these vintage Old Labour sentiments, said Mr Major,
happily producing a cutting from the estimable Morning Star.
It contained a statement from the Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs here
at Westminster supporting the strikers, he cried. Several Tory MPs uttered
noises of horror and aversion.
Mr Major recited part of the message that ``the struggle going on in France is
one of critical importance to working people throughout Europe''. It went on to
bash capitalism almost along the lines of the heady days of the Foot leadership
and the historic defeat of 1983.
Mr Major's conclusion ``that is real Labour'' had more than a touch of wish
fulfilment about it. He also loyally voiced the latest Central Office smart
line, possibly thought up by an ageing film buff. This possible admirer of the
excellent Henry Fonda movie ``Twelve Angry Men'' may have suggested that the 10
Labour MPs who fought their way past their own whips last week to show what
they thought of the capitalist 1p cut in income tax should be called ``The Ten
Honest Men'' at every possible opportunity.
They are honest, you see, because they openly admit that Labour should oppose
tax cuts and be prepared to increase public spending. This would have been more
impressive if those involved were not what the Opposition Chief Whip dismissed
as ``The Usual Suspects''.
It is probably more the conviction that Mr Blair is going to end nearly two
decades in the wilderness which has produced disciplined abstention and
unnatural silences from all on the left but the ``Honest Ten'' some of whom,
like Messrs Benn and Skinner may actually prefer opposition.

Chief Inspector Tom MacCorquodale said that the new rules, which will come into
force on February 4, would complement the town-centre camera surveillance
system.

MINISTERS today are reviewing plans to privatise Her Majesty's Stationery
Office in the wake of protests from the Treasury and the Speaker of the Commons.
Mr Roger Freeman told the Commons on Monday that he is reviewing the plan,
worth only about #20m to the Government, and he is expected to announce a
decision this week.
Last night at the Commons it was emerging that much more is at stake for the
Government than the Speaker's concern about the future of the Hansard official
record of Commons' proceedings.
Mr Freeman, deputy to the deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, has been
told by the Treasury that Her Majesty's Stationery Office also publishes the
annual Budget statement.
At stake is Budget secrecy. The Stationery Office so far has been charged with
this, including the all-important Red Book which details Government spending
and taxation plans. If the City got hold of these details from a private
printer, vast sums could be made on the money markets and stock exchanges.
Ministers last night countered that other highly secret Government publications
are already handled by private printers - including defence material and other
sensitive subjects. However, Budget details are another matter.
In the circumstances Mr Freeman is liable to have to get Cabinet approval for
this privatisation before it can go ahead. Speaker Betty Boothroyd is one
important person who is making firm representations to Mr Freeman on the
grounds that the published dissemination of the Commons's deliberations could
be jeopardised.
Behind the scenes there is a big Treasury rethink on this issue. The #20m that
the Chancellor might gain from privatisation is seriously outweighed by the
security involved in publishing his Budget statement efficiently and secretly
in the last few days before he delivers it.
Senior Tory back benchers are also adding their weight to representations
demanding from the Government how these highly sensitive market revelations
could be handled securely by a private printing company.

SCHOOLGIRL Naomi Smith died of shock after her throat had been cut by her
killer, an inquest heard yesterday.
The 15-year-old was killed after leaving her home in Ansley Common, Nuneaton,
Warwickshire, to post a letter for her mother just 100 yards away.
Her lifeless body was discovered by her father and her 15-year-old best friend
Emma Jones, lying beneath a children's slide on a recreation ground just three
doors from her home.
She had been sexually mutilated and her throat had been cut.
At a resumed hearing at Nuneaton town hall yesterday, attended by Naomi's
father, Brian, 45, mother, Catherine, 47, and brother, David Freeman, 25,
Warwickshire coroner Michael Coker said a post mortem examination report showed
the schoolgirl had died of shock following the horrific injury to her neck.
Referring to a report by a Home Office pathologist, the coroner said: ``The
cause of death can be described as shock and haemorrhaging due to the slicing
injury to the neck and compression of the neck.''
The coroner asked for an update on the investigation and Detective Inspector
Brian Varriale said: ``On Thursday November 16, a 19-year-old man was arrested
in connection with Naomi's death. He was charged with murder two days later. It
is intended that matter will go to the Crown court.''
Adjourning the inquest until the outcome of that trial, the coroner said that
he could now register Naomi's death, as the police no longer needed to carry
out further tests on her body.
Addressing her family, he said: ``More importantly, it allows me to release her
for her final rites to be carried out.''
Naomi's mother left the court in tears and her son David said the family was
still trying to make arrangements for Naomi's funeral service.
He said: ``We don't have any firm plans about when the service will take place
yet.''

THE official panto watchdog, Ofpants, was under a cloud en route to the Palace.
Well vapour more like. Distinctly camphor and eucalyptus ..... As Ofpants
barked and wheezed, I wondered, not for the first time, what this job does to
its personnel.
Some two hours later, still chuckling at various bits of genial japery - this
Sleeping Beauty is a very family-friendly show - and Ofpants had a checklist
dotted with power salutes and little smiley faces.
A lot of this is definitely down to Johnny Beattie's consummate skills as a
dame, no question. But Johnnie Adam (Jingles the Jester) has a good line in
ready patter while Graham MacGregor (King to Anne Field's Queen) is just funny
whether he opens his mouth or not. He's hilarious.
This means comedy of all sorts keeping the pace from flagging, so that the
songs even seem a quite desirable interlude!
But then Leigh Blaney - a personable Beauty - and Sally Logan (Fairy Crystal)
are actually worth listening to. Louise Beattie - this panto is affectionately
called the Baddy versus the Daddy - is a very classy, vampy wicked witch.
Ofpants thoroughly approves of pantos being a family tradition!

GULP, I'm feeling grim, unable to muster even the slightest grin to commemorate
the Smile for Safety Week, which was launched yesterday by the British Safety
Council as a combative measure against the perils of that most modern of
diseases, stress.
Forty years ago no-one went around banging on that they were stressed out but
now it affects one in three employees and is one of the main causes of ill
health.
So, the British Safety Council, anxious to stem the 90 million working days
lost through stress-related illness each year which costs British industry
#1.3bn, believe stress can be fought with a big smile, although I reckon two
weeks lazing in Lanzarote sucking up banana Daiquiris would be far more
effective.
Well, you lot can show off your bobby dazzlers all you want. This lady's not
for smiling, certainly not after the announcement earlier this week that men
are about to become a scarce commodity. I'm so shocked I can scarcely muster
the energy to put some lippy on, never mind twist my lips into a simpering
smirk.
This latest scaremongering snippet comes courtesy of Mihir Warty, an economist
at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). Having analysed the
population trends for the prime marriage age brackets - 18 to 29 for women and
20 to 31 for men - Mr Warty predicts that chicks will confront a dwindling
number of potential husbands early in the next century.
But hang on a minute. Perhaps this news is not all that it seems. It's tempting
to suspect that there might be a slight case of sour grapes here. Perhaps the
not very attractively monikered economist has been unable to find a woman
willing to become Mrs Warty! I mean, it doesn't sound very alluring, does it?
Perhaps he'll shock marriageable women into dashing out and snapping up the
first available chap before the millennium?
One positive side effect of CEBR's terrifying prediction is that female
participation in the more affluent end of the labour market will allegedly be
boosted. Mr Warty reckons that this is because women will become more career
minded to make themselves more economically attractive to the prime group of
men.
Shucks, sounds like Mr Warty has us babes sussed. He's clocked on to the fact
that we're normally only playing at the career game and are really sitting back
waiting for some guy to show up with a wad and an engagement ring. If he isn't
scheduled to make an appearance then we'll have to pull our finger out and
flaunt our own financial success. Drats. Sounds like too much hard work.
Mr Warty predicts that men will be in the optimum bargaining position in
relationship stakes which, these days, what with prenuptial financial
agreements and all are increasingly taking on the clinical, passionless status
of a contractual arrangement. Writing in the latest CEBR report Mr Warty says:
``When men are scarce they can bid up their price. As the `price' of men rises,
women may have to offer a more attractive package.''
As far as I can see the modern miss is already offering a near superhuman
package, prepared to put in the hours at the office, the home, and the gym,
take an interest in sport and not dare to look for too much commitment while
offering oodles in return. But Mr Warty is busy ticking the
``could-try-harder'' box.
He ventures that women may have to offer to work for longer, to return to the
labour force or - and this is when the tone of the report somewhat suspiciously
slides away from economic jargon - women may ``reduce their insistence on a
long-term commitment''. More alarmingly, he suggests, and now I'm really
starting to smell a (warty) rat, that women might have to ``provide a greater
level of promiscuity''.
Up and down the country economists are no doubt rubbing their hands in glee,
salivating over Mr Warty's vision of the woman of the future. She'll be rich
and successful and drive a racy little sports car - apparently the surge in
female affluency will correspond with rising sales in sports cars, as we
desperately turn to spending our dosh on tempting shag-wagons in an effort to
track the boys down.
The future lass will spend so much time in the office the future lad will be
practically footloose and fancy free. And, of course, even when she's not
working she'll be too scared to make any demands of him, so relieved will she
be that she's managed to get her hands on one of these rare creatures. She'll
be a proper little pussycat but a tiger in the bedroom. She won't mind if he
eats kebabs between the sheets because she'll be so grateful that he's between
the sheets at all. And boy will she show that gratitude. His every wish will be
her desire.
Hmmmm. Get real, boys, and file that image in the fantasy bin. By the start of
the next century if men in the UK are becoming scarce young women will have the
wherewithal and the sense of adventure to head off abroad looking for some
decent specimens.
We're not going to hang around at home becoming overworked doormat girlfriends
who turn a blind eye to promiscuous pursuits. There's plenty more fish in the
sea and, believe me, we'll be out there flirty-fishing. Perhaps we'll hook up
some hunky Alaskan chaps or entice some tasty Ruskies over.
We certainly won't be afraid to put out the bait. It's changed days since Helen
Morrison, a spinster of Manchester, was the first woman to place a lonely
hearts advertisement in a British newspaper.
Following her plea in the Manchester Evening Journal in 1727 the city mayor
responded by confining her to a lunatic asylum. Well, sorry boys, those days
are over. You're all nuts if you think we're going to get stressed out at the
prospect of a hubby famine. The very notion makes me giggle. Looks like I'm
smiling after all.

CARRICK Jewellery saw its future threatened by a disaster which happened half
way around the world. It recoverd enough to build a thriving business in the
UK, but its exporting ideas stayed only pipe dreams until it won a #20,000
award from GDA through the International Executive Scheme.
Set up in 1971, Carrick had specialised in producing traditional Scottish
jewellery for the tourist market. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster and subsequent
environmental paranoia had a devasting effect on tourism and Carrick's market
virtually disappeared overnight.
``The Chernobyl disaster panicked tourists,'' said managing director Eddie
Robertson. ``The downturn in visitors meant that we recorded our first loss
since we started trading in 1971. Sales went down by 22%.
``We knew prospects for sales and serious growth had taken a blow and that it
could take us years to recover if we were going to continue with our exisiting
range of traditonal Scottish jewellery. We had to find new markets - and
quickly.''
A change of tack led to the production of fashion jewellery. The original range
was small, but had been exhaustively researched by Carrick's team of designers.
The eventual product was instantly recognisable as being in the Rennie
Mackintosh style.
The entire first stock sold out in 12 months and the firm went on to develop
and extend the range. By 1988 the company had pulled itself free of financial
disaster and had a turnover of #700,000 a year. In 1989 it saw its first
#1,000,000 turnover. In 1995 the company has pulled in an astonishing #4m.
Last year Carrick invested more than #500,000 in doubling its manufacturing
capacity. Initially the Mackintosh collection was produced for the home market,
but it was not long before Robertson began to investigate the possibilities
offered by exporting. This would not have been possible, however, without the
support of GDA's International Executive Scheme.
``The company had reached bursting point,'' said Robertson. ``I needed someone
working on exports to promote the Collection and liaise with agents and
distributors.
``Financial support from GDA allowed me to take on a Belgian living in Glasgow
who had previously assisted us in translation and export marketing.''
January this year saw Carrick attend the Europacado Show in Belgium, where a
Belgian agent offered to act as a distributor throughout the Benelux countries.
The success of this arrangement encouraged Carrick to be present at further
exhibitions, and in September a visit to the Bijochar Exhibition in Paris led
to more international business - only 20% of which was from French firms. In
fact, Carrick's largest order from that exhibition came from Japan.
The award from the GDA has meant that Carrick can afford to attend exbhibitions
all over the world and pay for a full-time export executive. ``It has offered
us direct support, exactly where and when it was needed,'' said Robertson.
``This is the sort of assistance small firms need. There are a lot of people
ready to sell you advice, but at the end of the day it's support like this that
makes the real difference.''

MARK FISHER discovers an impromptu gathering which could set the theatre world
alight
THE fax proclaimed: ``Nigel Osborne's Alternative Christmas Circus.'' Down at
Richard Demarco's place in York Lane, Edinburgh. The arts editor was on to me
as soon as the fax reached his desk. ``Well, it's starting on December 5,'' he
said. ``Which is today. And the first event appears to be at 1pm.'' Brief
pause. ``Which is now.''
The underpublicised Alternative Christmas Circus transpired to be not a rolling
programme of pre-Yuletide events, but a 24-hour marathon feast of music, visual
art, theatre, and cabaret put together by Osborne, the composer and university
lecturer, with his students and pals including George Wylie (who'd sailed his
paper boat from land-locked Kosovo in the former Yugoslavia specially for the
occasion).
I made it along for 8.30pm when a production called Journey to Delphi (``A
meeting with Macbeth'') by a company of Scots and Poles was scheduled.
Before now, the Demarco Arts Foundation in the converted St Mary's School had
only really been active during the Edinburgh Fringe in August. But in dark
December it came as a shock to find myself in an all but deserted building,
with various handwritten signs indicating that something should be happening in
the vicinity.
Macbeth was due to go on outdoors in the courtyard. This on the day The Herald
had promised ``snow, frost and bitter winds from Siberia''. Suddenly a group of
people appeared and forced its way through an unlit doorway into the murky
shadows of the courtyard.
This, I try to remind myself, is how the best theatre happens, unexpected,
hidden, done for the love of it, not for the comfort of the audience. And here,
as a supermarket trolley full of wood was set alight, spitting sparks and ash
at the audience; as Macbeth's witches performed exaggerated angular dances or
bellowed down from the surrounding rooftops; and, as earnest Eastern Europeans
mused on the cyclical pattern of violence, revolution, and power struggle
across our continent, there was an invigorating sense of theatre as a real,
living, communicating, important medium.
Rehearsed in only a day and lasting just 15 minutes, it is not the most
coherent piece I've ever seen, but there's a passion and an energy there that's
worth nurturing. Young director Toby Gough was behind the show (and he himself
has only been given a day's notice - ``Hey, Toby you're playing the lead in
Macbeth tomorrow night,'' may be the stuff of most actors' darkest nightmares,
but it is the way this director flourishes).
He brought us Grimm, which won a Guardian Student Award a few years back, and
then Linnaeus, Prince of Flowers, an outdoor spectacle performed in the
Botanical Gardens in both Edinburgh and Glasgow and which he will recreate in
New Zealand in January.
In between he's been journeying through Africa to research a play about David
Livingstone, working in Sarajevo with local schoolchildren, and organising a
deputation of helping to get a package of leading British directors over to
Denmark for Copenhagen's Year of Culture.
The Macbeth project was on the cards for three years, and it is the ambition of
his collaborator, Zdislaw Hejduk of Poland's Teatr 77, to get a full production
put on in Scotland, possibly with the collaboration of Vaclav Havel and Gunter
Grass. Let's hope they pull it off.
By this time we were back inside, having wandered round the gallery spaces,
some displaying the work of the inmates in Saughton Prison, others of the
children from Preston Street Primary School, others still with Nigel Osborne's
Edinburgh University music students performing scratch improvisations next to
the installations.
In the bar, Caledonian Scouser Mitch Benn launched into his stand-up comedy act
with only his acoustic guitar and acerbic observations for protection.
So far, so 1995. It was then that Osborne's time machine started revving up.
Out came the ``anthropomorphic'' instruments - odd-shaped home-made
contraptions, a distorted violin, a box with protruding nails, which made the
kind of plucky, strummy and rattly cacophony that would have made any late-60s
acid trip seem seriously freaky.
But barely had we had a chance to find our feet in 1968, before we were dragged
back another decade. Not just improvised music this time, but simultaneous
action painting. You know, splattering colour on to the walls as the mood of
the music takes you. And take them it did.
I left them to their night of happenings, rather glad there were still people
prepared to behave like this in the otherwise straight and sensible nineties.
If Richard Demarco ever manages to get his venue operating in such a way all
year round, Edinburgh will indeed become a jollier more curious place.

A melodious tale
casts its spell
I SUSPECT that taking over the directorship of Theatre Workshop is rather like
coming face to face with the demanding Baba Yaga - you have to have the right
answers to the right questions and accomplish certain tricky tasks......
New director Robert Rae has, however, leapt the crucial hurdle of the Christmas
show with style: Vassalissa and the Baba Yaga succeeds in maintaining the
venue's best traditions of a rattling good tale with strong appeal for younger
children, while having more than enough dash and detail to hold the attention
of any accompanying adult too.
Based on an old Russian folk tale, Vassalissa brings together various abiding
themes: lonely girl mistreated by stepmother and stepsisters (shades of
Cinderella), a wily witch who asks riddles and eats children (the Sphinx meets
Hansel and Gretel!), and a magic doll who comes to life - every child's
cherished dream at some point - and ensures a happy ending for our heroine. It
may sound complicated, but the text and the playing make it easy and exciting
to follow.
There's also a lovely use of Eastern European influences lending a strange,
exotic edge to the magical, scary goings-on - the music (if not the singing!)
is thrillingly atmospheric. A wooden set on two levels has sudden windows and
an unexpected table.
The folk-costumes take on dramatic swagger in the case of the witch and the
mysterious, pennanted knights who guard the gates of her house of bones. Vari
Sylvester's Baba Yaga is slinkily malevolent, Mari Binnie's Vassalissa is
goodness without cheesiness, while Gillian Kerr and Shonagh Price provide the
necessary element of broad comedy throughout their various cantrips as the
self-centred, stupid step-sisters. An hour of quality enchantment.

Air fares war
is stepped up
THE cut-throat competition on the Glasgow-London air route intensified
yesterday. EasyJet, which began its cheap services to Luton last month, is to
freeze all fares between now and Christmas Eve at #29.
The company has offered a limited number of #29 fares since launching, but
these were on a first-come first-served basis and the remainder were priced at
#39, #49 and #59.
Body identified
A BODY found by police at waste ground on the A82 Loch Lomond road on Monday
was identified yesterday as that of Roderick Martin Campbell, 21, of Gladsmuir
Road, Hillington, Glasgow, who was reported missing on November 21. A
28-year-old man is the subject of a report to the procurator-fiscal.
Popular sentence
MORE than 5600 offenders were required to do community service by Scottish
courts in 1993. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish Home Affairs
Minister, said the figures reinforced the Government's commitment to the
development of community service as a tough and challenging disposal for the
courts.
#100,000 Turner
LANDSCAPE with a Rainbow, a painting identified as a work by J M Turner from a
fingerprint on it, fetched #100,500 yesterday at Phillips' auction rooms in
London.
Ice cream raid
AN armed man last night robbed an ice cream van in Paisley and escaped with the
takings, believed to be a three figure sum. The van salesman, a 26-year-old,
was threatened with a handgun but unhurt. Police hunting the raider said he was
in his early 20s, medium height and with red stubble on his face.
Drugs sentence
TEENAGER Dominic Russell, of Prestonpans, was sentenced to three years in a
young offenders' institution at Haddington yesterday for having drugs with
intent to supply.
Ram raid plea
POLICE are appealing for witnesses to a ram raid at the Kinnaird Park shopping
complex in Edinburgh early yesterday. A blue Ford Fiesta rammed the window of
Olympus Sport, and two men stole sportswear and equipment valued at #500.
Blaze death
A MAN was found dead yesterday after a fire in a house in Hartfield Crescent,
Neilston. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances and a report would
be sent to the procurator-fiscal.
Minder fined
ALAN Hannah, 42, was fined #300 at Haddington yesterday for assaulting and
ill-treating a six-year-old boy he had been minding at a house in East Lothian
where he was lodging.
Health trust plea
LABOUR MP Tommy Graham has written to Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell, calling
for him to stop a restructuring exercise at Renfrewshire Health Care Trust. Mr
Graham said he was appalled at the speed at which the move had been ``steam
rollered'' ahead.
Cue for inquiry
SHERIFF Andrew Bell yesterday called for police to investigate claims by
witnesses at Edinburgh Sheriff Court that staff in a city pub refused to call
an ambulance for a man who was assaulted with a pool cue.
Gretna record
AT least 3600 couples will have married at the register office in Gretna by the
end of this month. Last year's record figure of 3522 will be passed on December
23.

DIVISIONS over Europe within the Tory Party re-emerged yesterday as the Prime
Minister indicated that he will use this weekend's Madrid EU summit to urge
Britain's partners to think again about a speedy move to a single currency.
His leadership challenger in July, Mr John Redwood, raised the temperature by
launching a campaign against replacing the pound with a single currency and
called for the next Conservative election manifesto to rule out Britain joining
in the lifetime of the next Parliament, which could run up to 2002.
In a swift and angry response, the pro-Europeans led by former Foreign
Secretary Lord Howe, denounced his proposal as ``a fatal mistake.''
However, in Commons exchanges, Mr Major made clear that he will be taking a
Euro-sceptic stance on European Monetary Union up to and during the election
campaign.
Mr Redwood had welcomed his questioning of assumptions behind the drive for a
single currency at his recent meeting with the Italian Prime Minister. He asked
if he intended to pursue the points he had raised in Madrid where the heads of
government are due to discuss the agenda for next year's intergovernmental
summit on the future direction of Europe, nicknamed ``Maastricht Two.''
Mr Major told him he would following up the points he had made about ``the
problems that might occur were a single currency to proceed with a small
minority of countries in it and a larger majority of countries outside it.'' He
added: ``I believe it raises a whole range of issues that have not yet been
properly considered and I will be seeking further consideration.''
This pleased the Euro-sceptics but further alarmed the pro-Europeans already
enraged by Mr Redwood's move to commit the party against backing a single
currency, a move which some said privately could tear the party apart.
Last night, a group of them warned Mr Major that he should ``never say never''
to a single currency. Mr Redwood's intention to conduct a national campaign in
defence of the pound raises the nightmare prospect for them of an end to the
party's fragile ceasfire on Europe.
At his news conference, Mr Redwood said the entire grand design for a Euro
currency was already ``in crisis'' and would founder altogether if the French
people turned against it.
A pro-European group led by Lord Howe and EC Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and
including Lord Kingsdown, a former Governor of the Bank of England, issued a
joint statement saying: ``Any Conservative manifesto commitment against a
single currency would inevitably divide the party, fuelling its electoral
difficulties.
``It would set the Conservative Party leadership against major parts of the UK
business and finance community, undermining the party's political base.''
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said: ``The civil war in the Tory party
gets worse as the day goes on.'' He called on the Prime Minister to clear up
whether he agreed with Mr Redwood or not.
``As the rifts inside the Tory Party grow, it will become more necessary for Mr
Major to come down on one side or the other.''

THE Scottish Office has demanded an explanation from the Lanarkshire Healthcare
NHS Trust over apparent ``weaknesses'' in the management of a pilot computing
project.
According to a report on BBC Scotland yesterday, the trust spent #100,000 on
the information technology project without competitive tendering or signing a
contract. The report further claimed that the trust had no rights to the
computer software and had broken European rules governing competition.
The BBC alleged that an internal investigation in August had criticised the
management of the project on a number of counts.
The news report stated that the trust's director of nursing and its computer
adviser had earlier given the pilot overwhelming approval and costed a
three-year expansion of the scheme at just over #1m. But this was now in
dispute because the trust had no copyright control over the software developed.
The report named Master Applications, based at a business centre in Milngavie,
near Glasgow, as the computer company involved in the pilot.
In response to the claims, the trust yesterday issued a statement explaining
that it had invited Master Applications to work with it to develop computer
applications for community nursing and physiotherapy information systems.
The trust said it had already acted upon the recommendations of the audit
review. The pilot phase had been concluded and the trust had no continuing
contractual relationship with Master Applications.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said last nignt: ``We have asked the trust
for a report giving us full details.''

THE cross-cultural nature of Glasgow life is about to be captured on celluloid.
The rich texture of the Scottish-Asian community is the subject of a film
called The Making of Ronnie Singh which is based on the story of Glasgow actor
Subash Singh Pall.
With a name like Pall, it was always likely that Subash Singh would be a very
Glasgow kind of character. His career so far has ranged from running the Alien
Arts drama company in Kinning Park, through creating Banghra music with a
Scottish accent, to a role in Taggart.
So far, the film is still at the development stage. But now it is looking more
likely to come to fruition. The script has been written by Stuart Hepburn,
whose film McCallum about a Scottish pathologist in London hits our TV screens
this Christmas.
Shekhar Kapur, one of India's best-known film directors, has been approached to
make the movie. After a weekend on location in Glasgow to get a feel for the
story, Shekhar Kapur is very enthusiastic about the project.
Kapur hit the headlines with his film Bandit Queen. It is the uncompromising
true story of Phoolan Devi, a low-caste Indian who was gang-raped and
brutalised into a life of crime and goes on to become a bandit leader. The film
caused a storm of political controversy in India.
The Making of Ronnie Singh is a somewhat gentler story set in the South Side of
Glasgow. Among the delights enjoyed by Mr Kapur on his voyage of discovery
round Glasgow was the Govan shipyard where Subash Singh was an apprentice and
Ibrox Park for Saturday's match against Partick Thistle. (Yes, Subash was a
bluenose in his early days.)
Peter Broughan, the film producer behind Rob Roy the movie, has become involved
in the Ronnie Singh project. ``It will be the first-ever Scottish-Asian
movie,'' he says enthusiastically. There is a rumour, however, that Broughan's
enthusiasm may not be unconnected with his love of curries. In three days
showing director Kapur around Glasgow, he managed to fit in meals at Mother
India, Mr Singh's, and the Ashoka - three of Glasgow's finest Indian food
establishments.
Don't look back
IN our mailbag we find the top from a tin of Felix cat food emblazoned with
details of a special offer. Send #2.99 and you will receive an extremely cute
Felix 1996 calendar. Very straightforward except for the bit that says:
``Applications to arrive by 31-12-97.'' We always suspected that cat-owners had
flipped heir lids.
Dim view
MICHAEL Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, is a very nice man apart from an
irritating habit of always smoking bigger and better cigars than anyone else in
the world with the possible exception of his uncle Sir Lew Grade or Fidel
Castro. Mr Grade also talks about television all the time. So it was nice to
hear that he attended a business women's lunch this week in Dunbar and was
seated next to a lady who told him she hadn't watched a TV programme since the
coverage of the royal wedding in 1982. Perhaps they talked about cigars.
Down to earth
WE hear of a conversation between a country lady who lives a sheltered life and
a chap who is a keen member of the Territorial Army. He is telling her about
the coming weekend when he would be going parachuting. ``I didn't know there
was a place in Scotland where you could shoot parrots,'' she replied.
Nothing special
EDINBURGH has stolen something of a march on Glasgow with its Hogmanay
entertainment. The capital has three days and nights of events. The dear green
place has a party in George Square lasting three hours.
Edinburgh has concerts with the Kinks, Edwyn Collins, Gary Glitter, and Big
Country. Glasgow offers the Gyres, Swiss Family Orbison, Captain Shifty. Oh,
and the Bay City Rollers.
It is hardly surprising that visitors are heading east for New Year. But the
newly announced Glasgow programme does have one intriguing listing.
For the 15,000 who gather in George Square for the free party it promises
something called ``Performance intervention within the crowd''. Or, in other
words, a normal Hogmanay in Glasgow.
Biting comedy
STAND-UP comedians specialise in turning the events of everyday life into
vignettes for their performance. Phil Kay had plenty to tell his audience at
The Stand comedy club in Edinburgh earlier this week.
It was a topical Christmas story about his front teeth. How he lost three of
them (two real, one false) when his face came into contact with the forehead of
a bouncer at a Glasgow club. (Tales of blood and teeth on Glasgow pavements
seem to go down quite well in Edinburgh.)
As a complete contrast The Stand has another West of Scotland person topping
the bill on Sunday. He is Bruce Morton who, as far as we know, has all his
teeth - but almost no hair.
Twist in the tale
THE Langs Supreme Whisky Fourth Wise Man competition continues. And who is this
turning up at the stable in Bethlehem? David Thorburn of Clydebank suggests it
might be the innkeeper himself who is about to spoil the whole Christmas story
by saying he has had a cancellation and is now in a position to offer Joseph
and Mary a family suite.
Jack Lovie of Irvine nominates financial fraudster Nick Leeson who might turn
up bearing (if you'll pardon the pun) a gift of a baby bond.

Combining poetry and music gives a new meaning to the spoken word, as ANN
DONALD discovers
GLASGOW may be rather smug when it comes to boasting Booker and McVitie winners
but when it comes to the ascending art form of performance poetry the former
city of culture has been lagging sadly behind its east coast cousin.
For the past two years Edinburgh has been reclaiming the goatee-stroking world
of poetry via the determinedly youthful club-inspired and buzzing atmospheres
of Rebel Inc magazine and Yellow Cafe's big nights out, while Glasgow stayed in
a time warp of middle-aged Arran jerseys and pints of bitter.
Thanks to Rebel Inc's natural successor, the innovative west coast literary
magazine Cutting Teeth, and the CCA's equally innovative events policy, this is
set to change with the dynamic Motor Mouths series. For Margaret Ritchie, the
CCA's events co-ordinator, the aim of the four nights - embracing everyone from
John Cooper Clarke to Mancunian Lemn Sissay and the Nuyorican Poets - is to
explode the preconceived notions most people still retain from being force-fed
Wordsworth and Keats at school.
``It's not about sweating blood and trying to decode a poem on the page but
rather the poetry jumping off the page and hitting us smack between the eyes
and ears. It's a celebratory, dynamic and thought-provoking thing and not an `I
wandered lonely as a cloud' thing at all,'' she says.
One notable factor underpinning the Motor Mouth poets' work is the close
relationship with music and its ability to reach an audience for whom the word
``poetry'' had previously induced a shudder of distaste or stream of bored
groans and sighs.
In America this combination of music and performance poetry has proved to be
potently commercial with poets appearing on compilation albums alongside
Nirvana and Pearl Jam, regular spots on MTV, and endorsing everything from Nike
to jeans from The Gap.
Bobby Millar, Samantha Coerbell and Alan Kaufman who launched the Motor Mouth
series on Saturday with an impressive display of verbal pyrotechnics, are all
regulars at the Nuyorican (New York Puerto Ricans) Poet's Cafe in New York's
Lower East Side.
Kaufmann explains the Spoken Word phenomena sweeping America: ``The scene rose
from the ashes of the stand-up comedy scene because many of the poets were
addressing subjects in a humorous way. Also every art form bar poetry had been
exhausted.''
What clinched it though were the infamous poetry Slams which take the form of a
league match where poets lock together in verbal gladiatoral combat competing
one-on-one for cash prizes, judged by the audience on a point system. ``I
remember walking into the Cafe for the first time,'' recounts Kaufmann. ``There
were 200 people dancing and then the music stopped, the lights went up and the
poetry slam was announced by a vaudevillian guy sliding across the stage. Four
poets appeared and the audience judged them, booed them and cheered them. This
mix of music, dancing and spoken word went on to 4am. It was a revolution!''

THE widow of murdered headmaster Philip Lawrence said yesterday she hoped his
death would not be in vain.
Mrs Frances Lawrence said she hoped his pupils would grow up knowing right from
wrong and with a firm belief that love must triumph over hatred.
She broke her silence, for the first time since her husband was stabbed to
death on Friday, in an open letter to the children of St George's, Maida Vale,
west London, to say how much comfort they had given her.
``Your sweet letters to me recognise that, in that moment, the world was
deprived of a man of great strength, tenderness, and profound understanding,''
she said.
Mr Lawrence, 48, a father of four, was stabbed as he intervened to stop a pupil
being beaten up by a gang outside the Roman Catholic school.
``Violence is not a knife in the hand. It grows, like a poison tree, inside
people who, unlike yourselves, have not learned to value other human beings,''
she said.
``Now, I trust you to work as hard as you can, in school and at home, to create
a world in which goodness is never again destroyed by evil.''
At her home in Ealing, west London, Mrs Lawrence said she had been moved by the
thoughts and wishes of the hundreds of people who had written to her.
She wrote to the pupils: ``You tell me how he gave you pride in your school
and, even more importantly, in yourselves. You speak of his friendliness and
humour.
``At home, he would share with me and the children his delight in your daily
progress and his conviction that each one of you is a fine human being who has
the potential to achieve great things.
``I share that conviction.
``Through your loving letters, I can see how much you care about other people.
I can see that you understand the difference between right and wrong and your
belief that love should always overcome hatred.
``Your headteacher's - my husband's - death will not be in vain if you grow up
with these ideals firmly rooted in your hearts.
``I have heard so much about you all. I have found great comfort in your
letters and comments. I should like to visit you in the new year.''
Detective Superintendent Brian Edwards, leading the inquiry, made a direct
appeal to the family, relatives, and friends of the youths involved in the
murder to contact police with any information they had.
He said no-one should be deterred from coming forward by speculative reports on
the inquiry.
Scotland Yard has denounced reports that the murder team was on the verge of
making arrests.
``It's unhelpful to us. It causes distress to the family. It's just inaccurate.
It raises false expectations,'' a spokesman said.
A team of 24 detectives is sifting nearly 200 statements from pupils, staff,
and others, and Mr Edwards said they had had a ``wonderful'' response from the
public.
Mr Ian Hamerton, administration manager at St George's, said classes were
running as normal although an air of grief continued to hang over the school.
``While there may well be tears inside, we still have jobs to do,'' he said.
For the second day children arrived for school with flowers in memory of Mr
Lawrence, and Mr Hamerton said they had been deluged with calls and letters
from well-wishers.
``We're treating the situation with care and dignity, which has reduced the
need for counselling, but we still need some,'' he said.
``Pupils have freedom throughout this week to see counsellors at any time they
wish. We have many locations throughout the school when we can have either
group or individual counselling as the need requires.''
He knew of no pupils who were too distressed to attend school.
``There's been a determination on the part of some of the children to come in.
There were pupils in yesterday who would not have normally come in because they
were not well.''

FORD'S 22,000 manual workers are to be balloted on industrial action in the new
year after union leaders yesterday confirmed their rejection of the company's
``final'' pay offer.
Union officials will seek an urgent meeting with Ford in a last-ditch effort to
head off a dispute. Meanwhile, local officers will be told to prepare for a
postal ballot on industrial action in protest at the offer, which is worth
about 9.25% over the next two years.
Mr Tony Woodley, the Transport and General Workers' Union's national secretary
for the motor industry, said a ballot was the next logical stage, although he
declared himself optimistic that industrial action could be avoided, if Ford
returned to the negotiating table and improved its offer.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator for the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, said: ``The company can be under no illusion that, unless
significant improvements are forthcoming, the unions are determined to conduct
a massive campaign for a yes vote in the ballot on industrial action.''
Ford unions are seeking a rise of 10% to compensate for huge productivity gains
and are very keen to win a two-hour cut in the 39-hour week, although Ford has
said it will not concede reduced hours.
A Ford spokesman said the company would wait to be officially notified by the
unions about the decision before making any comment.
Meanwhile, negotiations are set to resume tomorrow over broadly similar demands
for Vauxhall's 9000 blue-collar workers, who are banning overtime and taking
Friday afternoons off after rejecting an offer of 3.5% this year and the rate
of inflation next year.
They, too, are being denied any reduction in their 39-hour week, and are in
effect seizing a two-hour cut by leaving work at lunchtime each Friday.

<HEADLINE>Management buy-in team led by ACS plans to diversify following #20m deal Philips sells Airdrie factory</HEADLINE>

PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics giant, has agreed to sell its Airdrie telephone
factory to a management buy-in team in a deal worth more than #20m.
The buy-in is led by David Boyce, an English businessman who formerly worked
for Canadian and US manufacturers of telecommunications equipment.
His company, ACS Communications, will take over the factory with 400 employees
once the deal is completed later this month.
ACS will continue making telephone equipment for Philips for at least five
years, but it also plans to manufacture for other original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs) and develop own-brand products for sale direct to
retailers and telephone installers.
ACS will create about 20 new jobs in sales and marketing at the factory. Mr
Boyce said there were no plans to reduce the shop floor workforce, which should
be kept busy for the forseeable future.
ACS signed a letter of intent to buy the factory yesterday, but details are
being kept under wraps while it ties up a financing package.
Mr Boyce, his partner Sandy Ellis, and several top managers at Airdrie who have
joined the buy-in, will provide a considerable chunk of equity with the help of
a large bank loan.
Murray Johnstone Private Equity in Glasgow will complete the deal with several
million pounds of venture capital.
``The total funds being raised for the acquisition and for on-going development
of the product range will almost certainly be in excess of #20m,'' said Graham
Miller of Murray Johnstone.
Only part of this sum will be paid to Philips. The rest will be working capital
for ACS, which plans to diversify Airdrie's client base and product range
rapidly.
At present the factory produces telephone equipment for small offices,
including exchanges with up to 100 lines, exclusively for Philips.
Mr Boyce, a Londoner who is chief executive of ACS, said that within three
years Philips should represent only a quarter of the company's business.
``We have been negotiating with other OEMS and we have reached some heads of
agreement which are confidential,'' he said.
ACS is buying not only the factory, but also the intellectual property rights
to the telephone products manufactured there. ``We are acquiring an enormous
kitbag of technology that we can use to develop other products,'' he said.
Philips announced several months ago that it wanted to sell the Airdrie plant
so it could concentrate on manufacturing telephone equipment at the larger end
of the market.
Eventually, it attracted Mr Boyce, who had been looking for a small
telecommunications business in the UK to buy into.
After studying engineering and business studies at Bradford University, he
worked for the Canadian firm Northern Telecommunications for 14 years in both
North America and Europe.
Mr Boyce then became head of overseas business for Texas-based BSC
Communications in Dallas for four years. He left in 1994 to set up his company.
Glasgow-born Mr Ellis, the finance director of ACS, is an old friend of Mr
Boyce who worked alongside him in both his previous jobs.

NOBODY promised us an easy life or a safe one. If you drive you face the risk
of an accident and if you smoke your lungs will be polluted and possibly
destroyed. If you drink alcohol you encounter a substance which can be a
civilised pleasure or a corrosive addiction. This spectrum, ranging from
pleasure to pain, is not a single jump but a continuum. Where you find yourself
on it depends on an array of elements which include your state of health, what
you drink, how much you drink, and how you drink. There may also be a genetic
disposition to excess. All this is set down, not that readers may be confused
but that there may be a very real appreciation of the fact that safe drinking
is not a matter for generalisations but must be composed of a reasoned
assessment of the benefits and dangers in the light of personal experience and
circumstances. Those who make such an assessment with the aid of the best
advice possible will survive and maybe even flourish from moderate consumption
of alcohol; the unheeding will damage themselves and may die.
Where this leaves the Government's attempts to set safe limits for alcohol is
not entirely clear. It can be argued that it is the duty of a Government to
advise citizens on matters like this and, perhaps more importantly, thereby to
reduce the burden of coping with the consequences for the National Health
Service of unwise consumption. If that is the starting point the method of
accomplishing it is exceedingly difficult. Safe levels of alcohol are given in
units, but a unit of strong beer will have more effect that a unit of weak beer
and the same applies to wine. Careful drinkers will work this out; careless
drinkers would not know a unit if it bit them, which assuredly it will in time.
Mr Dorrell's latest attempt at explanation, and his amendment upwards of the
safe limit, is not particularly helpful. The timing is crass, even if you
acknowledge that safe drinking and driving and safe drinking are separate
issues. Mr Dorrell does not make enough of the fact that medical opinion on the
new limit is divided. The safe limit is now estimated at 28 units of alcohol
per week for men, but the report also points out that those who drink four or
more units a day may suffer a health risk. What is abundantly clear is the risk
of bingeing. Spread your weekly units evenly over the week and you may be safe.
Pack them into a weekend, or one unwise evening, and you could be in serious
trouble; that is why the new safe limit is expressed in daily rather than
weekly units. Well and good, but the real task is to persuade everyone to sit
down and think seriously about what they are doing and to refer any problems or
questions to a doctor. Guidelines are fine, but they are no substitute for
personal responsibility.

JOHN MAJOR arrives in Madrid tomorrow night preparing finally to confront the
vexed issue of the European single currency at the EU summit. Playing on his
mind will be the increasingly alarming thought that on this, the biggest
political initiative in the 40-year history of the European Union, the British
Government might just have got it all terribly wrong.
A new air of anxiety is noticeable among British Ministers and their senior
officials when the subject is raised these days. Plainly, things are not going
their way.
For the moment, the back-bench Tory Eurosceptic rebels are quiet, except when
they step out of character to cheer on the French strikers protesting against
the unpopular disciplines France must take to join the single currency. But
supporters of economic and monetary union (Emu) can take heart. With luck, the
French street disorders will soon be history and the Emu project should be back
on course.
Between the biggest players in Paris and Bonn there is, on the surface,
complete agreement that Emu must and will succeed - and on schedule. The
European Commission, although privately split on the timing, insists the great
dream will come true. No-one - anywhere - seriously believes the single
currency is mere fantasy.
All of which explains why the rising tension in British Government circles
where the most senior figures are now talking apprehensively about what will
happen to those countries who are unwilling or unable to join the single
currency on Day One.
John Major's difficulty is that his famous negotiating triumph at Maastricht,
when he won the right for Britain to opt-out of a single currency, looks as
though it has rebounded on him. He won his standing ovation in the Commons at
the time but the short-term party political advantage has long since
disappeared. Emu's progress might be tortuous but it is undeniable. Now the
Prime Minister faces Edward Heath's gloomy apocalypse of a Britain locked
outside Europe while others take the real decisions inside.
British Government leaders are fretting as never before that countries opting
into the single currency will celebrate their own boldness by taking the
unification process a step too far. This would involve them forming unofficial
voting blocs on vital political issues while ignoring member states which
retain their own currencies.
This action would be justified by their claim to be the true standard-bearers
of European unification and that they had proved themselves with their
commitment to the single currency, the jewel in the European Union's crown.
British officials are punting a new phrase for this eventuality. They are
talking grimly of other countries beginning to engage in a ``radical
undermining of the European Union''. In today's atmosphere in the European
Union, where Britain is isolated on so many issues, this is Apache talk.
John Major cannot abide the thought of Day One inner-core members of the single
currency - who will almost certainly include Germany, the Benelux states and
Austria, and perhaps France - hijacking the EU's economic and political agenda
in this manner. How dare they?
This nightmare is of John Major's own making. He could make the best of things
and boast to his Eurosceptics that he is his own man, determined to ensure that
Britain remains independent and sovereign with its shrunken pound. A
Eurosceptic General Election campaign might help. The political cost is, of
course, high: he must then test the patience of the majority of his own party
who are pro-Europe and he must be content to watch European decision-making
being run increasingly by a small group in which Britain has no influence.
Alternatively, he could join in the debate now about the effects of the new
money on excluded currencies and perhaps warm publicly to the idea of founder
British membership. But that would be seen as a U-turn of possibly fatal
proportions. Mr Major has got himself in a bind which is becoming daily more
painful.
The British pound will probably meet the Maastricht criteria for joining the
single currency from the start. A decision by Britain not to support this most
European of European aspirations will not go down well with others in the
community - especially big countries like Spain, for example, which is
desperate to join a single currency but simply cannot meet the Maastricht
conditions. Much more sympathy will be extended to the Spanish and others like
them, including the strongly pro-EU Italians, with their limping lira, who are
also keen to join as soon as they possibly can. Only now, it seems, is the
price of remaining aloof dawning on Mr Major as the rest of the EU gets serious
about abandoning its separate, competing currencies. In Madrid, they will
choose a name for the new money and have a tough discussion on so-called
``monetary cohabitation'' which is horrible Eurojargon for the relationship
between currencies which stay out and those which merge.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, for whom the march towards Emu is a crusade,
will demand safeguards for the single currency against voluntary competitive
devaluations from those on the outside. He will have by his side the faithful
French whose President, Jacques Chirac, has sworn to join Emu as a founder
member. The strength of Chirac's commitment and his solidarity with Kohl have
also taken British observers by surprise.
Suddenly the British are sounding urgent about the need to study the effects of
the single currency on those remaining outside. ``It would be wrong just to
wait and see how it works,'' a British official reasoned yesterday. Observers
could be forgiven for wondering why this thought did not command more attention
from John Major several years ago.
For no-one in Britain has done more to suppress the debate on the single
currency and its effects than the Prime Minister. His former Foreign Secretary,
Douglas Hurd, called for a widespread public debate on the issue. Mr Major
later slapped him down along with the entire British Government.
Mr Hurd called himself an agnostic on the subject - and even that diplomatic
sidestep would be a touch too outspoken for his famously pragmatic successor,
Mr Rifkind. Can anyone recall a British Minister giving a strong opinion,
either for or against the single currency, in public recently?
There is a simple explanation for this unedifying abandonment of
responsibility. Mr Major used his opt-out - successfully - for party political
consumption. But now the real world has caught up.
The Prime Minister cannot expect to be taken seriously when in one breath he
says it is too soon for a public debate on the single currency and in the other
that we must first know the advantages and disadvantages of joining it before
we take a decision.
As Europe's leaders head for a summit on the single currency, John Major could
find he has condemned Britain to being a sideshow, reports Murray Ritchie

PILLAR Property Investment, the investment and development company floated on
the stock market in August 1994, has received planning consent for the first
phase of 130,000.sq.ft of its Broomielaw development site where most of the
demolition and clearance has been completed.
Chairman Raymond Mould, unveiling the company's half-year results yesterday,
including a first-ever interim dividend of 1.5p, commented: ``While it is not
our intention to commence speculative development, we are encouraged by the
extent of interest in possible pre-lets which would then enable construction to
commence.''
Pillar bought the second phase of the Broomielaw site in July 1994 for #4.25m.
It permits 920,000.sq.ft of office development over a period of years.
The first phase, comprising 280,000.sq.ft of offices, was developed in the late
eighties by Scottish developer Bellhouse Joseph and Kumagai Gumi of Japan. In
the present construction phase, Pillar is working in partnership with Bellhouse
Joseph.
Just how long the development of the whole site will take must depend on the
state of the Glasgow property market, which has only seen a little improvement,
according to chief executive Patrick Vaughan, but will take several years. As
the company stresses, it is only interested in pre-lets.
Meanwhile, pre-tax profits grew from #34,000 to #1.1m after charging #852,000
in respect of the deficit over book value arising on the sale of Tower
Ramparts, Ipswich, earlier in the year. This investment was acquired for #16.5m
in 1991 and its sale contributed a surplus of #4.8m to distributable reserves.
The surplus earned on the sale of Ipswich, together with the trading profit for
the period, more than covers the interim dividend.
Looking ahead, the chairman said that at the beginning of the calender year
there were high expectations of rental growth in the property sector but this
had not materialised across the board. However, there had been strong rental
growth in retail park investments and in the company's shopping centres. There
were also indications of improvements coming on a broader front, he said.
The investment market has been dull and given this background, it is pleased
with the sales and purchases which have been concluded this year.
Pillar continues to have high gearing though it remains confident this is at a
``sustainable'' level. However, close attention continues to be paid to the
cost of debt and every opportunity is taken to minimise financing costs with
all investments financed so that rents more than cover interest. Cost capping
and longer maturities are also part of its armoury.
The shares dipped 2p to 142p.

Cray slumps
into the red
CRAY Electronics shareholders will not receive an interim dividend payout after
the group reported a slump into the red yesterday.
Restructuring and rationalisation costs of #9.3m in the group's principal
communications division were largely responsible for sending the company diving
to a pre-tax loss of #14.6m for the six months to the end of October.
That compared with a taxable profit of #10.1m in the corresponding period last
year when it paid out a 1p interim dividend.
Earnings per share last time of 3p were converted to losses of 6.3p.
Wood contract
JOHN Wood Group, the Aberdeen offshore services company, has won a three-year
contract to provide maintenance services for Total Oil Marine's North Alwyn
platform in the North Sea for a further three years. The #3m contract will
involve 33 Wood Group staff working on the platform, which Wood Group has been
associated with since it was commissioned in 1985.
Tunnel directors
ROY Chapman, retired senior partner of accountant Arthur Andersen in the UK,
Keith Edelman, chief executive of Storehouse, and Chris Green, chief executive
of English Heritage, have joined the board of Eurotunnel as non-executive
directors.
Dana float
DANA Petroleum, an independent oil production company with operations in
western Siberia, is to seek a full listing on the London and Irish stock
exchanges.
On board
PATRICIA Mann, a vice-president international of advertising group J Walter
Thompson, has been appointed a non-executive director of British Gas.
BET swap
INDUSTRIAL services group BET has exchanged its manned guarding business,
Shorrock Guards, for Securicor's electronic security business Securicor Alarms.

<HEADLINE>Survey shows Scots really are canny with the cash</HEADLINE>

IT'S not a myth - Scots really do put away the most money for a rainy day,
according to the results of a lifestyles survey published yesterday.
It shows that investors north of the Border put an average 15.4% of their money
into savings and investments.
The average for the rest of the UK is only 10.3% - except for London and
South-east England, where it drops to between 5% and 7%.
However, the report says that when the Scots do splash out, they like to spend
their money on having a good time, with holidays among their priorities.
The report, by analysts Mintel, shows that the north-south divide is narrowing,
with the traditionally rich South-east of England worst hit by the recession.
Other regional patterns show that Londoners spend least on cigarettes, while
Northern Ireland, with the lowest property prices, spends the most on fuel
bills and groceries.
People in the North-west of England prefer to spend money on booze, while Scots
and Geordies put cigarettes high on their list of priorities.
The quality of life in London is improved by owning your own home - but people
in South-east England look to luxury items to improve their lot.
In Anglia and the Midlands having a good pension was more important, but those
in South-west England and Wales listed health insurance.
The Scots just want money, holidays, a TV washing machine, and the chance to
smoke in peace.
A Mintel spokesman said: ``The canny Scottish saver is not just a myth, they
really do save the most. They tend to be cautious with finances and look for
safe investments.''
The report is based on surveying 1519 adults throughout Britain.

<HEADLINE>Housing cuts could mean 10% rent rise 400 council jobs at risk in cash crisis</HEADLINE>

A CASH crisis could mean a 10% increase in Glasgow District Council rents and
the loss of more than 400 jobs.
A combination of circumstances, including an anticipated #33m cut in the city's
housing capital allocation from the Scottish Office, has left Labour
councillors with agonising decisions to make prior to the Christmas break.
And it means the new City of Glasgow Council will take over the running of the
city in April in an atmosphere of deepening financial gloom.
Crucial to the situation is the Government's imminent announcement on housing
capital allocations - permission to borrow - which officials expect to be cut
from #98m in the current financial year to #64.4m.
According to council sources, it would mean no new housing starts in the next
financial year and no new programmes to tackle housing problems.
It is understood the anticipated Government cut, together with factors related
to the loss of prime housing stock in Rutherglen and Cambuslang to the new
South Lanarkshire Council, could mean a rent increase of #3.56p per week and
400 job losses in housing, building services and property services.
The average rent in Glasgow is currently #33.23p per week.
Another factor in the financal crisis is the practice of capitalising staff
salaries. This is currently running at around #12.5m and is likely to be
halved, putting more pressure on the revenue account - the rents.
But the final kick in the teeth for many councillors was the recent Scottish
Office announcement that 25% of all capital generated by council house sales
will be clawed back to pay off local authorities' capital debts.
The situation could be more acute in future years if the Scottish Office
implements its intention to increase the clawback to 50%.
Meanwhile, a financial expert warned yesterday that thousands of tenants in
homes owned by Scottish housing associations could face rent rises because of a
little-noticed proposal in last month's Budget.
The move, if ratified by the Scottish Office, would end the associations'
effective exemption from corporation tax and leave them facing annual bills
totalling more than #2m.
Mr Mike Blyth, the Scottish managing partner of chartered accountants Kidsons
Impey, said the change would force housing associations to raise their rents,
or put off maintenance on homes.
In Scotland, non-charitable associations have traditionally received a full
reimbursement of any corporation tax from the Scottish Office, via funding
agency Scottish Homes.
Mr Blyth said:``The Chancellor has adopted a back-door method to save cash by
taking away grant aid that was extremely important to the majority of housing
associations.
``For many tenants, this move will, almost certainly, more than offset the
personal tax reductions offered in the Chancellor's speech.''
Mr David Orr, the director of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations,
said: ``This proposal is a body blow to Scottish housing associations and has
no justification.''

LEUKEMIA victim Jaymee Bowen - formerly identified in court battles only as
Child B - was rewarded yesterday for her courage in fighting the disease.
She was one of eight children who picked up Woman's Own Children of Courage
accolades.
Four-year-old Susanne Shepherd from Beith, Ayrshire, was cited for her courage
in enduring many excruciating operations, including one failed transplant, for
a rare kidney condition.
Eleven-year-old Jaymee admitted she was ``embarrassed'' to win one of this
year's medals.
``It's quite normal to get ill and try to fight off the bug. I don't think I've
done anything special,'' Jaymee shrugged before collecting her award from the
Duchess of Kent at Westminster Abbey in front of a gallery of celebrities.
Jaymee's plight was highlighted after Cambridgeshire Health Authority refused
her treatment on the NHS believing her condition to be beyond medical help and
her father launched a court case.
But after private treatment she is back at school in Hertfordshire and she said
yesterday: ``I feel fine.I hope to do games at school soon.''
During the presentation of engraved medallions, actor Anthony Andrews read the
citations and actress Gemma Bissix - Clare Tyler in EastEnders - read a lesson.
Other celebrities taking part were Big Breakfast star Gaby Roslin, Coronation
Street actress Sherrie Hewson, Sean Blowers from London's Burning, pop group
Deuce, and children's BBC presenter Josie D'Arby.

Murderer dies
in prison
A PAISLEY man who beat a stranger to death 19 years ago for two packets of
crisps and 35p died yesterday in Saughton Prison, Edinburgh, where he was
serving a life sentence.
Allan Gowdy, 40, is believed to have died from a severe asthma attack in his
cell. In 1976, at the High Court in Glasgow, Gowdy was jailed for life for
murdering a 57-year-old man.
Housing group
AN umbrella group, Helensburgh and District Housing Federation, has been formed
to represent six local groups when Argyll and Bute Council takes over in April.
The group was previously linked with Dumbarton District Council.
Vandals at risk
TEENAGE vandals are risking their lives by removing electrical parts from
street lights in Argyll. The police warning follows reports that live parts,
carrying mains power, are being taken from lights in Lochgilphead and nearby
Ardrishaig and that someone could be electrocuted.
Youth jailed
A TEENAGER was ordered to be detained for 2!s years yesterday for a knife
assault. Kenneth Allan, 18, of Hamilton, admitted stabbing another youth twice
in the body during a fight last year. Allan's victim made a full recovery after
nine days in hospital, the court heard.
Ring robbery
WEDDING rings valued at more than #20,000 were stolen during a break-in at Fred
Hill the Jewellers in Argyle Arcade, Glasgow, on Monday, police said yesterday.
No tribute
HOUSE-building giant Barratt has angered a councillor in Newmains, Lanarkshire,
by refusing to donate to a memorial for boxer Jim Murray. David McKendrick was
so irate at the builder's claims of poverty yesterday that he sent company boss
Sir Lawrence Barratt a #10 postal order ``to help him get over the recession''.
New assessor
THE Glasgow-based Student Loans Company has appointed Mr Graham Chandler, who
recently retired as registrar of Nottingham University, as its new independent
assessor. He takes over from Mr David Birrell, who is retiring.
Thunderbirds go
AN anonymous Thunderbirds fan paid #23,000 yesterday for Lady Penelope's cerise
Rolls-Royce at Phillips auction house in London, then a further #20,000 for the
original 12in model of Parker, its cockney chauffeur. The lady herself is going
down under, snapped up for a bargain #14,000 by an unnamed Australian.

Glasgow's Hospitality Inn in October.
#7m development
A #7M PLAN to develop a former bakery site into a 100,000sq.ft non-food retail
unit with 500 parking spaces could create more than 150 jobs in Dundee. The
application, by Grantchester Group plc, to build the unit opposite the Kingsway
retail park will be made at the next meeting of Dundee District Council's
planning committee.
Plans for Tweed
MORE than #2m in funding is being sought from the Millennium Commission to
develop the Tweed estuary at Berwick. Planned projects include an innovative
walkway into the river; a small-craft marina; a special hospital to treat of
swans and other wildlife; and dock entrance improvements.
Plant approved
A CONTROVERSIAL giant #12.5m sewage works near Lossiemouth has been given the
go-ahead by Grampian Regional Council, and will be built if Moray District
Council approves. The unanimous decision yesterday was made despite opposition
from the Lossiemouth Action Group, which is now considering a petition.
Head fined
HEADMISTRESS Murial Macleod Macdonald of Bragar School, Lewis, was fined #400
and disqualified for 15 months at Stornoway Sheriff Court yesterday for driving
with an excess of alcohol. Macdonald, 34, admitted the offence and had
not-guilty pleas on four other traffic offences accepted.

MORE than two million day time TV viewers across Britain will be treated to a
dash o' Doric on Friday.
Fourteen pupils from Drumblade primary school in Aberdeenshire have been picked
to perform their Nativity play on This Morning.
But the children, aged between five and seven, will not alter the dialect for
viewers.
The three-minute play includes the line, ``Cwid we hae a wee keek at the
bairn,'' spoken by farmer's son Sandy Hunter, six.
The play ends with Sandy saying: ``I'll gie him ma' crook. It's nae muckle but
it's a' I've got.''
Programme producer Peter Trollope said: ``It's just what we want. I'm sure
people will get the jist. We picked Drumblade because it sounded a great
school.''
Mrs Aileen Ingram, whose seven-year-old daughter Emma is one of the cast, wrote
to the programme after she saw the appeal for plays. ``I told them that Edna
Smith, their teacher, was retiring next year and she had been producing the
little ones' nativity plays at Drumblade for more than 30 years and it would be
a great tribute to her and the children.''
The children travel to Liverpool by coach on Thursday. Their play will go out
live on Friday between 10.30am and 12.30pm.

MAKERS of gel-filled capsules of Temazepam yesterday launched an urgent High
Court challenge against Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell's decision to ban its
top-selling product from the NHS.
Mr Dorrell acted after misuse of the capsules was linked to the deaths of drug
addicts.
Yesterday Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, appearing for the pharmaceutical company R P
Scherer Ltd, argued the Minister had exercised his powers unlawfully.
He said almost the entire prescription of Temazepam in the UK was to NHS
patients, and Scherer had a 67% market share as the sole manufacturer in the
country of gel-filled capsules.
If the ban was implemented, the company stood to suffer ``severe losses''.
The QC won permission to seek judicial review of Mr Dorrell's decision.
GPs will still be able to prescribe the less popular tablet and elixir forms of
the drug.

A NURSE who admitted stealing #1515 belonging to patients at Lennox Castle
Hospital was struck off the register with immediate effect by the professional
conduct committee of the UK Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health
Visiting in Edinburgh yesterday.
Mrs Margaret Main Brady admitted three charges of misconduct while she was
employed by Greater Glasgow Health Board and was working as an enrolled nurse
at the hospital in Lennoxtown, near Glasgow.
She admitted misappropriating #1515 of patients' funds by six unauthorised
withdrawals between October 5 and December 30, 1992, attempting to
misappropriate a further #354 of patients' funds on January 25, 1993, and
forging the signatures of four nurses and two managers in furtherance of the
two earlier offences.
The offences came to light after an audit in January, 1993, and she was
dismissed on February 10.
Mr Dave Watson, regional officer for Unison Scotland, for Mrs Brady, in a plea
of mitigation, asked the council to accept that her offences were isolated and
uncharacteristic.
At the time of the offence, Mrs Brady had been under considerable stress
because one of her children was ill and her husband had left her. Fortunately
her son was now much better and she was reunited with her husband.
Mr Watson said Mrs Brady had 11 years of exemplary service as an enrolled nurse
before this incident, and she had a good work record since. She now works at
Campsie View Nursing Home, Kirkintilloch.
After a recess of 55 minutes, Mrs Elizabeth Rush, chairman, said it had been
decided to remove Mrs Brady's name from the register with immediate effect.

MANAGING millions excites the popular imagination even when the millions
represent a weak currency rather than, say, the Swiss franc. To laymen the
intricacies of contemporary capitalism touch the margins of magic and romance,
areas of unreason. To professionals these are the areas where reason is most in
demand and the whole process demands the coolest mental qualities whether it is
futures (of various kinds), currencies, bonds, or stocks and shares which are
being managed. The Leeson affair attracted so much attention because all the
numbers involved seemed staggering. Those who manage monies and investments
come to take the sums involved for granted. It requires much industry and rare
qualities all the same, and imposes a fair amount of stress. The practitioners
really operate at a point where art and industry fuse and the least that can be
said to explain the goings on at Dunedin Fund Managers is that such fusion
imposes great tension, and that even the most detached intelligences can
abruptly seek to change jobs. A goodly clutch of its top investment managers
have recently quit the Edinburgh company. How much their going has damaged the
company is a matter of guesswork, though they have taken a large part of their
customers with them from what is a multi-million dollar client base. It is a
reminder of how this sort of work has soared in Edinburgh in the past two
decades as well as how important pension fund asset management has become to
the Scottish investment community.
What precisely went wrong at Dunedin remains to be explained but such events
may well become more, rather than less, common in the future. We are producing
more companies engaged in managing international investments all the time. It
seems to be something at which we are rather good; something where Scotland's
reputation for monetary prudence and probity has evoked a considerable
following which crosses international frontiers. It needs to be protected from
upheaval.

A FATHER told last night how he learned from a call on a mobile phone that his
21-year-old son had become the latest statistic on Strathclyde's drugs death
toll. Mr Frederick Hutcheson was on his way to work when his wife telephoned to
say his son, Mark, had become ill.
As Mr Hutcheson returned home to Barra Crescent, Old Kilpatrick,
Dunbartonshire, he was held up by motorway traffic and called his family, only
to hear his son had died.
It is thought to be the 100th drugs-related death in Strathclyde this year,
although this has yet to be confirmed by a post-mortem examination. There were
97 such deaths in Strathclyde last year, 43 in 1993, 73 in 1992, and 21 in 1991.
His father said in a local radio interview last night: ``Once I got five
minutes away from home I phoned to see how he was. My daughter answered the
phone and said he had died. I could not believe it. When I came home he was
just lying on the floor.
``Twenty-one years of age and he had never done any harm to anybody in his
life.''
His son had told his family he had a drugs problem and they had taken him to
the charity Turning Point for counselling. However, on Saturday night Mark said
the problem was ``desperate'' and since then he had remained inside the family
home in Old Kilpatrick.

THE Laggan community's chance to buy their local forest from the Forestry
Commission is a surprising and most welcome decision by the Secretary of State
for Scotland.
Given the opposition he is meeting from the Forestry Commission and the deep
dissatisfaction of local people with that body in other areas of the country
perhaps Geoff Fagan, of the Conservation and Development of Sparsely Populated
Areas department at Strathclyde University, should be a bit more streetwise
about the issue (December 8).
The SNP has long seen a transfer of land and forest resources to the local,
resident population as the essential catalyst to a revitalised countryside. The
Laggan community deserves every public support to set up its pilot project of
local forest management.
But the nation as a whole needs consistent, long-term commitments in such a
policy shift. I hope Mr Fagan will join me in calling for the Scottish Office
to lay down a formula for purchase of forests by local communities along the
lines which agricultural tenants can negotiate to buy their farms.
This could create a price structure far below the Treasury's clawback target on
the sale of public forest assets to private, absentee speculators.
Councillor Rob Gibson,
8 Culcairn Road,
Evanton.
I AM astonished that no-one seems to have realised the main reason why the
Secretary of State is so willing to pass over to community ownership
substantial areas of publicly-owned land such as crofting estates.
This is because it will reduce public expenditure, such as the cost of estates
offices and other landlord costs. In the case of many private landlords their
decision will also be made on the same basis, ie, will it save or cost them
money?
The Government's repeated claim that there is some predetermined level of
public expenditure which is essential to economic prosperity is nonsense.
Part of that expenditure is simply a transfer of money from some people to
others. The other part, related to real goods, services, and investment, is
what matters.
When a large part of the assets built up by this part of public expenditure is
sold off at knock-down prices this is further proof that the Government neither
knows nor cares what are the real values of publicly-owned assets or
publicly-funded services and investment.
Except, of course, when owning these assets costs them money.
G Houston,
Strachur,
Argyll.

SECRETARY of State for Scotland or against Scotland, Santa or Scrooge, white
knight or black prince? In six months in office Michael Forsyth has shown
Scotland more faces than a 50p piece.
He was at it again yesterday in a new format for the Scottish Grand Committee
which seems mainly designed to allow him to make a long speech and then have
equal time with everyone else answering questions.
A small tip here for George Robertson. One of the reasons that Forsyth runs
rings around you is that he chooses political battlefields where Labour's
lumbering army are at a disadvantage rather than an advantage.
Another reason is that Forsyth has put the Government machine in Scotland into
gear in a way which his predecessors would have considered slightly offside. Of
course Messrs Younger, Rifkind, and Lang, although gentlemen all, were not
above a bit of politics. We know that from the now-celebrated leaked memo from
Lang to the Prime Minister on March 3, 1992, which revealed that the Scottish
Office income and expenditure statement for Scotland was something he had
``prepared and printed'' as part of ``our campaign to undermine the other
parties''.
This was the forerunner to the statement which Forsyth has been claiming this
year as an ``independent and objective'' exercise. Of course, as one of his
officials confided to me cheerfully yesterday, the difference is that under
Forsyth's Scottish Office such a revealing memo would not have been allowed to
leak!
I am not so sure about that. I have known Michael Forsyth for a long time right
back to St Andrews University - lo even unto the days before he was a
Thatcherite. Since then his public presentation has improved beyond all measure
although occasionally the mask is allowed to slip.
However, then and now his real talent has been for ferocious backroom
organisation. First a determination to pick an opponent's weakness and then
devote all resources to pursuing ruthlessly the point to destruction, and
secondly the iron insistence that everyone else in his team sings from exactly
his song-book - or else.
The first is an impressive talent as his pursuit of the Convention on their
``aunt Sally'' proposal of 3p variation in income tax indicates. However, the
second has brought him into difficulties before and is likely to do so again.
When his tenure as Tory chairman in Scotland ended in total disarray some years
ago the key problem was his inability to persuade all Tories to abandon
independent thought and gear their minds into ``Forsyth speak''. Now the Tories
are more desperate and more malleable. They are unlikely to present any
problems at any level which require to be taken seriously.
But what about the Scottish Office and wider than that? Is it possible to
control every public servant in Scotland and recruit them as cogs in the Tory
propaganda machine?
Some will be easier to recruit than others. MPs were told yesterday that the
Chairman of Scottish Enterprise, Professor Donald Mackay, had effectively
volunteered a #33m cut in his budget.
This story was loyally backed up by Scottish Enterprise but is subject to
serious problems.
First all of the Local Enterprise Companies will have to be carried along with
this merry tale of being able to fulfil their responsibilities within a much
lower budget.
Secondly it seems remarkable that Highland and Island Enterprise seem to have
simultaneously reached an identical conclusion that a budget cut of exactly the
same magnitude was possible.
My guess is that this story of enterprise agencies happily falling on their
financial swords will start to come apart as the year progresses.
And elsewhere the cracks will begin to show or be leaked. The reality is that
the Scottish Office budget is planned to decline in real terms by around 5%
over the next three years or the equivalent of #600m. No amount of sharp
politicking is going to camouflage long the real political strains that result
from that grim reality.
The political appointments in the Scottish Office will be resented by career
civil servants. The problems following spending cuts will start to dominate the
agenda not just in the big losers like housing and industry but also in health
and education where the settlement is less favourable than in England and Wales.
In one of his less-than-inspired moments yesterday Forsyth said that in an
independent Scotland we would all be living in ``mud huts''. This makes an
interesting contrast with his Prime Minister who two weeks ago described the
same constitutional prospect as ``perfectly credible''.
The fact is that in an independent Scotland we could reasonably aspire to the
same standard of living and rate of growth enjoyed by other comparable small
European countries. That is higher than anything which can be expected under
Michael Forsyth.
We would also have the satisfaction of living in a democracy where people not
only choose who should lead the country but where public servants are allowed
to recognise the difference between factual information and political
propaganda.

ARITHMETIC was never my strongpoint, but even I can calculate that the
``generous'' handout on law and order by our dedicated Secretary of State (at
the expense of virtually everything else within his deliverance) amounts to
fewer than 2!s additional policemen per annum within each Scottish constituency
over the three years' ``assistance''.
Methinks even Mr Forsyth's pathetically minuscule band of fellow-Tory MPs will
be somewhat under-impressed, not least Allan Stewart, battling away in what,
following April's Unitary Council elections, has become a marginal Eastwood.
Here, the ``benefit'' amounts to fewer than 0.12 extra bobbies per ward for
each of the years!

THE Foreign Office was last night checking a report that British youngster Ben
Needham, who disappeared during a holiday in Greece more than four years ago,
has been found safe and well.
Ben, who would have been six years old two months ago, was found with a gipsy
man who had a history of abduction, according to the Greek TV station Antenna.
The claim was reported in the Daily Mail.
A Greek policeman was quoted as saying: ``A child has been found and it is
believed to be Ben Needham. I don't know exact details at this stage of who
found him, but I think it was a private investigator and police colleagues
believe it is definitely him.''
The blonde youngster went missing at the age of 21 months during a holiday in
July 1991 on the island of Kos with his parents Simon Ward and Kerry Needham of
Sheffield.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: ``So far we have been told nothing by the
Greek police to indicate this report is true but are continuing to look into it.
``Over the years a number of reports of sightings of Ben Needham have been
reported and they have all proved to be inaccurate.''

<PAGE>19</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974913602</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CREDITABLE performance has been turned in by one of the six investment trusts
in the troubled Dunedin Fund Managers' stable.
Net asset value at Dunedin Smaller Companies rose by 11.2% to 350.3p per share
in     the year to October 31, after          a strong performance in the
second half. The #64m trust    out-performed its bench-      mark index. The
FTSE Small Cap index rose by 10.1%, but the more broadly based All-Share index
was 12.9% to the good.
Borrowings were maintained at #5m during the year, and this assisted the
performance of the trust, which was managed by Neill Pirie until the recent
exodus from Dunedin. Stewart Methven has taken over as fund manager.
At the end of the year total investments represented 109% of shareholders'
funds. Recognising the vulnerability of the smallest companies to the slowdown
in activity, Dunedin has reduced the weighting of stocks capitalised at below
#50m from 42% to 26% over the last two years.
It said the dividend income from the trust's portfolio continued to rise, but
earnings per share fell from 8.96p to 7.78p. This was blamed on the profit and
loss account having to bear a full year's interest charge on the borrowings.
A final dividend of 6p means the total for the year will be held at 9p.
n.SLUGGISH Japanese equities and under-investment in the robust US markets
drove Dunedin Worldwide Investment Trust to underperform its benchmark index by
more than 6% in the year to October 31.
The trust, managed by Edinburgh-based Dunedin Fund Managers, saw net assets per
share increase 5% to 877.3p. That compared unfavourably to an 11.2% rise in the
Morgan Stanley Capital International World index, the trust's benchmark.
n.SECURITIES Trust of Scotland has become the latest Martin Currie investment
trust to borrow cheaply in yen to boost its Japanese share portfolio.
The #347m trust has arranged a one-year 2000m yen (#12.8m) loan to boost its
Japanese equities portfolio from 1% to 5% of gross assets.
Last week, Martin Currie's #790m Scottish Eastern Trust borrowed 4650m yen
(#30m) to boost its own Japanese share portfolio.
The yen loan raises Securities Trust of Scotland's gearing to 18% from 16%.

LOTHIAN Health is to offer in-vitro fertilisation to childless couples for the
first time.
Directors have agreed that up to #200,000 can be spent next year and the same
amount in 1997/98 to provide three cycles of IVF to about 40 women a year who
meet specified criteria. Thereafter up to #100,000 a year will be available to
provide IVF to about 20 women a year.
The extra money for the first two years is to take account of couples whose
names have been held on file while a review of the board's policy takes place.
Director of public health, Doctor Helen Zealley, explained that IVF was now the
most effective treatment option for approximately half of all subfertile
couples referred for treatment.
A Lothian Health spokesman said it had a list of 50 couples waiting for
treatment but at this stage it was unclear how many of them would be eligible
under the new criteria.
Candidates must be childless, resident in Lothian, and in a stable heterosexual
relationship where the female is not older than 37. They must be subfertile for
three years, or four years where the cause is unknown, and be suitable for IVF
treatment.

A #350,000 libel victory won by rock superstar Elton John two years ago was
slashed to #75,000 yesterday in a landmark Court of Appeal ruling which is set
to put an end to excessive awards for defamation.
Until now, libel judges and lawyers had been largely barred from mentioning
actual figures to the jury to help them decide how much to award.
But in yesterday's judgment, which has immediate effect, three appeal judges
held that counsel on both sides of a case and the trial judge can put figures
to the jury ``to reflect the upper and lower bounds of a realistic bracket''.
And the jury's attention should be drawn to damages awarded in personal injury
cases, said the Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Bingham, sitting with Lords
Justices Neill and Hirst.
``It is in our view offensive to public opinion, and rightly so, that a
defamation plaintiff should recover damages for injury to reputation greater,
perhaps by a significant factor, than if that same plaintiff had been rendered
a helpless cripple or an insensate vegetable,'' he said.
``It serves no public purpose to encourage plaintiffs to regard a successful
libel action, risky though the process undoubtedly is, as a road to untaxed
riches. Nor is it healthy if any legal process fails to command the respect of
lawyer and layman alike, as is regrettably true of the assessment of damages by
libel juries.''
The judges said that mentioning figures, far from developing into an
``auction'', would ``induce a mood of realism on both sides''.
The award to Elton John in November 1993 included #275,000 ``exemplary''
damages to punish the Sunday Mirror for publishing a totally untrue story that
the singer-songwriter was hooked on a bizarre ``diet of death'' which was a
form of the slimmers' disease bulimia.
Jurors accepted his claim that the story was printed recklessly without regard
to the truth and with the main eye on boosting sales of the newspaper for
profit.
But payment of the rarely-awarded punitive damages was suspended pending an
appeal by Mirror Group Newspapers, and yesterday the appeal judges held that
the total award was ``manifestly excessive''.
They cut the exemplary award to #50,000. This, they said, was sufficient to
reflect the gravity of the newspaper's conduct and deter others.
They also reduced the remaining #75,000 compensatory award to #25,000. Although
the article was false, offensive and distressing, it did not attack the star's
personal integrity or damage his reputation as an artist, the court ruled.
The 48-year-old star, said yesterday the case had left him out of pocket.
His legal fees amounted to #160,000 against damages of #75,000, leaving him
with a bill of #85,000.

THE prominent Free Church theologian Professor Donald Macleod was last night
strongly urged by his Church to seek paid leave of absence until criminal
proceedings against him had been resolved.
Professor Macleod, 54, of Morningside, Edinburgh, has been charged with six
counts of indecent assault involving five women over an eight-year period. The
case is due to be called again today at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
A special commission of the Church's general assembly, attended by an estimated
60 ministers and elders, was convened in Edinburgh last night.
After five hours of what appeared to be heated debate behind closed doors at
the headquarters of the Church, the chairman of its natural law advisory
committee, Mr John Sutherland, emerged with a prepared statement.
He said: ``The commission of the assembly strongly advise the Rev Professor
Donald Macleod to seek paid leave of absence and to seek the discharge of his
duties as professor of systematic theology in Free Church College until such
time as the matters that are the subject of criminal proceedings against him
are finally resolved.''
He stressed this was not a disciplinary procedure nor a vote of no confidence
in Professor Macleod, a father of three. ``He has been asked to take leave of
absence with no stigma attached,'' he said.
Mr Sutherland said the assembly still stood by its decision in May when it
cleared Professor Macleod of misconduct and said at that time the matter was
closed.
Asked how much support the eminent theologian had received from the assembly,
Mr Sutherland said: ``I don't think it would be appropriate or in any way
helpful if I were to discuss matters which were held in a private session.''
He said there were bound to be divisions in any Church of democratic society
and said it was vital all aspects were debated.
From his home late last night, Professor Macleod, issued a statement in
response to the decision which said: ``This calls into question my whole
relationship with the Church and leaves me asking is this Christianity?''
He did not attend the meeting personally and was represented by the Rev Alex
MacDonald, of Buccleugh and Greyfriars Free Church.

JACK McLean seems to imply that any donations to the Prince and Princess of
Wales Hospice would go towards keeping Princess Diana in expensive underwear
(December 8). This is a piece of fatuous self-indulgent nonsense.
The work of the staff of the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice has brought
loving support to hundreds of the dying and their families (including my own)
and Jack McLean's disapproval of the Princess of Wales's lifestyle is no sound
reason for not supporting this and other hospices throughout the city.
The Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice has already had to cut back on
staffing levels and has had to leave unused a fully equipped eight-bedded ward,
ready for more than a year, because it cannot afford to employ the necessary
staff.
Glasgow needs this kind of dedicated service and all the generous support it
can get. If Jack McLean has any real concern for the ``old and dying'' he
should be giving this institution, and similar bodies, his wholehearted support
instead of getting his knickers in a twist over one of the nominal patrons of
the hospice.

THE Princess of Wales, it seems, is not only ``paranoiac'' but, and this is so
much worse, ``impolitic''.
Her Majesty the Queen, mother of her people, has not found it necessary to make
comments upon the homeless sleeping on the streets in all weathers, which could
imply criticism of a Government led, as we all know, by a man committed to a
classless society.
Of course, there will be those, not only at home, but in the Commonwealth, who
will feel such comment, however impolitic, has some merit. I can hear the
rebellious Aussies saying, ``Good on you, Diana!''.

HOSPITALS in Scotland carried out a record number of operations last year with
fewer beds but more staff.
According to the Scottish Health Statistics 1995, published today, the total
number of operations, 757,000, was 6% higher in 1994/95 than in the previous
year.
The average available bed complement was 42,351, 1800 less than the previous
year, but average stay dropped from 13.8 days to 13.1 and the number of
in-patients treated rose from 952,256 to 959,921. There were 200 more doctors
and dentists and 100 more nurses.
The total number of patients on the waiting list fell from 82,065 at March 31,
1994 to 79,703 at March 31, 1995.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish Health Minister, said: ``The NHS in
Scotland is performing well and providing an excellent standard of patient care
for the people of Scotland. The total number of patients treated in hospital
increased by 50,000 in 1994-95, and now stands at a record level. This includes
an additional 43,000 operations.''
The report showed that food poisioning continued to rise, from 3255 cases in
1993 to 4056 last year.
Deaths from heart disease continued their downward trend, while cancer deaths
overall remained stable.

ALTHOUGH politicians of all parties and levels profess to be zealous in
spending our tax money wisely they signally fail to consider their own
activities as being poor value for money.
In the US Congress has 435 Representatives and 100 Senators for some 250
million of a population. The European Parliament has 410 MEPs for a population
of over 300 million. The UK Parliament has 652 MPs and untold numbers in the
Lords for under 55 million.
A reduction of 60% or better of the Commons incumbents and the elimination of
the Lords, at least as presently constituted, would result in a considerable
saving when taking in the support cast and backstage workers. More money for
the health service and education, etc?
As far as Scotland goes if we really really must have another layer of
government in Edinburgh, give the jobs to the girls rather than the boys for a
change, no more than 40 to 50 of them, and see if they can show more common
sense.

THE Prince of Wales yesterday urged companies to do more to help the community
in countries where they are operating.
He told a gathering of 200 senior business, government and voluntary agency
figures at St James's Palace, ``The greatest challenge for business is to
encourage managers to play an active part in the communities where they are
based.''
This could involve helping with education, employment opportunities, assistance
with delivering health care or strengthening community organisations, he said.
The prince was marking the fifth anniversary of his international trust, the
Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum, which was founded to promote the role
of business as a partner in the development of emerging and other economies.
The prince said there were many remarkable examples of how co-operation by
business had brought about ``sustained development'' of these communities.
He said support from business had ``snowballed'' and asked his audience: ``Do
we always have to wait for disasters or crises before we recognise the
importance of getting together to address the priorities of sustainable
development?''
And there was a strong business case for companies to become involved in the
communities where they were working.
It should be seen not just as philanthropy, but mainstream business practice.
A recent survey carried out by the forum has found that almost 70% of business
students - tomorrow's managers - believed being involved in communities was an
essential part of modern business practice, he added.
``The real challenge, it seems to me, is for many more companies and many more
partners to become involved, to communicate more widely the ideas which may
have started as experiments, but now seem so much more part of the mainstream.''
It was only through the survival of communities, and the cultural and spiritual
values that they enshrined, that a truly sustainable approach to our existence
on the planet could be achieved.

A NURSE who gave her ten-year-old son a potentially fatal dose of insulin was
put on probation for three years at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday.
The woman pled guilty last month at the High Court in Edinburgh to two charges
of assaulting the boy, in the family home in Fife and in Edinburgh's Royal
Hospital for Sick Children, by administering insulin to him to his severe
injury and the danger of his life.
She also admitted stealing insulin and syringes from a Fife hospital where she
worked.
The woman was originally charged with attempted murder, but her plea of not
guilty was accepted by the Crown.
The court heard earlier how she put insulin into her epileptic son's drip in
the Edinburgh hospital where doctors were battling to stablise his condition.
She told police the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had begged her
to ``give him a bit of peace''.
However, the judge, Lord Johnston, was told that when the boy recovered he
denied this.
The court heard that the boy suffered an injury at birth which led to epilepsy
at the age of five and that he suffered migraines and would fly into
cataclysmic rage reactions.
Advocate-depute James Campbell told the court that the mother gave colleagues
at her hospital the impression that her son's case was terminal and asked if
insulin could be detected at a post mortem examination.
The boy was taken to hospital in Edinburgh in March this year after his mother
gave him pain killers when he complained of headaches. Doctors at the hospital
discoverd he had a high insulin level.
Later medical staff at the mother's hospital contacted the Edinburgh hospital
to say they saw her with the keys to the drug fridge and with syringes and
ampules of adrenalin.
A doctor checked the boy's condition in hospital and concluded that it was
``fairly possible'' that insulin had been administered to the child in hospital.
The woman told police: ``I didn't try to murder him. I just wanted to do what
he wanted me to do. He just begged me and begged me.
``I love him more than anything else in the world, but I hate to see him
suffering.''
Mr Campbell said that when the boy was admitted to hospital his condition was
``life-threatening''. Without treatment it would have proved fatal or left him
with brain damage.
Mr Gordon Jackson QC, defending, said: `It's difficult for us to understand the
pressure on this woman. It seems clear she simply became mentally ill and had a
breakdown.
``There is no rational explanation for what she did. It appears it was a cry
for help.''
Lord Johnston told the mother yesterday he was ``heartened'' by background and
medical reports.

STRATHCLYDE Regional Council has lost its appeal against an industrial
tribunal's ruling that it unfairly sacked an Asian social worker.
Mr Abdur Rashid Zafar was dismissed in 1989 following alleged incidents
involving clients and colleagues.
In April this year, a Glasgow industrial tribunal decided that his dismissal
was unfair. It further ruled that the dismissal was discriminatory on racial
grounds.
The region then appealed against the decision, and the Employment Appeal
Tribunal heard the case last month. It has now issued its findings dismissing
the appeal.
Mr Zafar, 59, from Garnethill, Glasgow, said yesterday: ``I am very pleased
that this seven-year ordeal is over. It is shameful that the biggest local
authority in Europe, which claims to be an equal opportunities employer, should
treat ethnic minorities like this.
``They have wrecked my life. I can not describe how it feels to lose your job
through no fault of your own.''
A regional spokeswoman yesterday confirmed it had received the appeal
tribunal's findings.
The original industrial tribunal hearing of Mr Zafar's case began in September,
1993. His claim of unfair dismissal had the backing of the Commission for
Racial Equality.
The region denied racial discrimination and maintained that he had been sacked
for professional misconduct after allegations made against him by clients and
colleagues.
The industrial tribunal also dealt with several other complaints from Mr Zafar,
including alleged racial discrimination over promotion, but rejected these.
When the region lodged its appeal against the tribunal's ruling on his
dismissal, a tribunal hearing to decide on a remedy - the questions of
reinstatement and compensation - had to be postponed. It is not yet known when
the remedy hearing might take place.
But Pakistan-born Mr Zafar, who spent 20 years in social work in Glasgow, said
yesterday he would be seeking his job back and up to #150,000 in compensation
to cover loss of earnings, pension rights and injury to feelings.

THE ineffable optimism of some politicians is what makes them sometimes
attractive people or, in Mr John Redwood's case, a downright mystery. Yesterday
he announced his mission to the businessmen by initiating yet another campaign
against the European single currency. He plans to launch a debate inside
British industry on the subject and confidently believes that he can sway
businessmen and persuade them to speak out against a single currency.
There is nothing wrong with a debate; democracy thrives on it and on the
subject of European Monetary Union it would make a welcome change from the
usual hysterical jingoism which has emanated from Mr Redwood's corner.
Businessmen have said often enough in recent months that they would welcome
some reasoned argument on the subject, and also that they are irritated and
worried by the Euro-scepticism which is so prevalent in the Government party
and which they believe is damaging to their business prospects and to the
national interest. Given that the bulk of business leaders consulted by the CBI
have also said clearly that they are not against a single currency and are
opposed to any move to rule it out as an option, Mr Redwood may find his
wide-eyed campaign less than welcome. So be it; he appears to be the sort of
man who learns lessons only by bumping into reality and no doubt his talks with
businessmen will be an enlightening experience, if only for him. But, as we
report elsewhere this morning, the dangers of British isolation on this issue
are growing and should not be underestimated. Senior Tories, including Lord
Howe, Lord Kingsdown, and Sir Leon Brittan warned yesterday that any manifesto
commitment against a single currency would split the party and alienate
businessmen. More importantly for the national interest, it would confirm
Britain's position as a slow-track member of the EU. That must not happen.

FORMER Scottish international football star Frank McLintock admitted in court
yesterday using a ``ruse'' to get round an antiquated Football Association ban
on payments for agents who recruited players during a deal with England coach
Terry Venables.
The one-time Arsenal and Scotland central defender said he received a fee -
described by another witness as #25,000 - for handling the #2.1m Spurs signing
of ex-Nottingham Forest player Teddy Sheringham.
Mr McLintock said a #50,000 invoice submitted to the White Hart Lane club
deliberately omitted to mention that part of the money was for that purpose. He
claimed many clubs used a similar stratagem.
Mr McLintock was giving evidence at Central London County Court where
advertising executive Jeffrey Fugler is suing Mr Venables's London club Scribes
West for #19,379.88 plus interest allegedly outstanding on a #30,000 bill for a
campaign to recruit members.
The club denies it owes the money and is counterclaiming a similar amount to
take account of the cost of the campaign's failure to stimulate new business.
During the first part of the hearing last month Mr Fugler claimed that Mr
Venables's business partner, Mr Eddie Ashby, showed him a number of bogus
invoices, one of which was from Mr McLintock's sports management company, First
Wave.
Mr McLintock, questioned about the First Wave invoice, agreed with Mr Shane
Dougall, for Mr Fugler, that while the document only referred to ``distribution
and merchandising network'' activities for Spurs, it had been decided to
``lump'' the Sheringham transfer work in with it.
That move, he explained, was so he and his partner would get the ``agreed fee''
that had been asked for.
Mr Dougall: ``Part of that invoice involved negotiating the deal with Mr
Sheringham, and you are getting a fee for that.'' Mr McLintock agreed.
Mr Dougall: ``If one looked at that invoice one couldn't possibly see that. Mr
Sheringham is not mentioned in that invoice.''
Mr McLintock again agreed with him.
The barrister: ``This invoice hides a payment to agents?'' Mr McLintock: ``Yes,
it does.''
Mr Dougall: ``That was a common ruse . . . at the time?'' Mr McLintock replied:
``It is used by a number of clubs, if not most of them, to get past what is
seen as an antiquated law of the Football Association.''
Regarding the so-called ``ruse'', he later told David Farrer QC for Scribes
West: ``The vast majority of clubs do this. It is widely regarded as the thing
to do . . . clubs can pay plumbers or accountants but not agents who could have
worked long and hard for them.''
The trial was adjourned until today, when Mr Venables is expected to give
evidence.

A 14-YEAR-OLD schoolgirl gave birth to a stillborn baby in secret and hid it
overnight under her bed in a plastic bag, a court heard yesterday.
The following day, Christmas Eve, she took the body to a park and abandoned it.
The discovery a week later of the child who became known as ``baby nobody''
sparked off a major police appeal which was solved only after the girl became
pregnant again by the same man and had an abortion.
Yesterday, at the High Court in Edinburgh, Peter Staszek, the 43-year-old man
who got the girl pregnant twice was jailed for six years after he admitted
having unlawful sex with her.
Mr Craig Scott, Advocate-depute, told the court that it was not until December
last year that the girl realised she was pregnant after having sex with the
accused.
``She didn't tell anyone about the pregnancy and wore baggy clothes to school
to conceal the fact.''
The girl also tried to stay with her grandmother as often as possible, but,
just before Christmas, her mother wanted her to go back home.
On December 23 the girl was suffering from a sore back, not feeling well and
stayed off school. Late that night she felt as if she needed to go to the
toilet.
``However, when she did so she had a baby. She describes it as having been
delivered feet first. She picked up the child and indicates that when she did
so the child was dead.
``In due course, with some difficulty, she managed to cut the cord and dealt on
her own with the afterbirth. She placed the body of the baby boy in a carrier
bag, put it under the bed and went back to bed.''
The following day she got up early and, after her mother went out, got dressed,
took the body from under the bed and took it to a park, the Kilns in Dalkeith,
Midlothian, where she placed the bag near a path.
The body was discovered a week later by two young boys who were passing by.
Police launched an appeal for the mother to come forward, and the infant was
buried in a moving ceremony at Newbattle cemetery, Dalkeith.
The Rev Jared Hay, who conducted the service, pleaded with the mother to come
forward, saying: ``We really don't know why we should have to be here to lay in
the cold ground a baby who should be lying warm and cosy with his mother.''
Tbe girl did not tell anyone what had happened and did not see a doctor.
``She simply returned to school and continued with her normal life,'' the
advocate-depute told the court.
About six months later, at the beginning of June, the girl suspected that she
was pregnant again. She had a pregnancy test, which proved positive, after
going to the doctor on the pretext that she had been bitten by a dog.
This time, she told her mother she was expecting and the pregnancy was
terminated on June 19.
Mr Scott added: ``At the hospital the girl told her mother that the baby which
had been found abandoned in a bag at the Kilns was her baby.''
She also revealed that Staszek was the father of both infants and this was
confirmed by DNA tests.
Mr Gordon Jackson QC, defence counsel, told the court that there had never been
any question of force being used and the girl had consented to intercourse.
Like everyone else, the accused had known nothing about the first pregnancy
until it was revealed by the girl.
Mr Jackson said that the girl was now in what could be described as a state of
denial in that she was saying that she had never been pregnant on the first
occasion and that she had made up the story.
However, the scientific evidence proved otherwise.
Jailing Staszek for six years, temporary judge Mr Alexander Wilkinson QC
described the offence as a dreadful abuse of a young girl.

RAIL privatisation was shunted into the sidings yesterday as Appeal Court
judges demanded more time before deciding whether it can proceed or whether the
lengthy passenger franchising process must be started afresh.
Instead of giving their ruling yesterday morning as expected Sir Thomas
Bingham, Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Waite and Lord Justice Otton,
announced they would not be in a position to give their verdict until Friday.
Labour transport spokesman Mr Brian Wilson described the delay as ``very
hopeful news and a further humiliation for Ministers''.
He added: ``I am sure that pressure will continue to mount for them to scrap
the whole thing.''
The first franchises for passenger services on South West Trains and LTS
(London, Tilbury and Southend) Rail were due to be announced yesterday, but
will now remain under wraps, until next Tuesday at least, after the court
ordered a stay on any signing of contracts.
Whichever side loses the current legal battle is likely to appeal to the House
of Lords for a final ruling.
Campaigners had asked the Appeal Court judges to overturn a High Court ruling
on Friday which cleared franchise director Roger Salmon of accusations that he
unlawfully set minimum passenger service levels at too low a figure.
Mr Justice Macpherson ruled then that Mr Salmon had not acted ``perversely,
irrationally or unfairly''.
But in the Court of Appeal the pressure group Save Our Railways, backed by the
rail unions and more than 20 local authorities, made another attempt to have
the sell-off procedures declared fatally flawed and illegal.
Yesterday Sir Thomas told a packed court that ``having read the papers
overnight and thinking about this matter - and being conscious of the great
public importance of the issue which is raised'' - it would wrong to be
``stampeded'' into giving judgment this morning ``when we none of us feels
ready to do so''.
He said he hoped the reasons for the hesitation would be understood and said
the court now planned to give its full judgment on Friday morning.
SOR is challenging the legality of the franchising proposals for the first
three lines to be sold off - Great Western, South West Trains and LTS Rail - as
well as the next four: InterCity East Coast, Network SouthCentral, Midland Main
Line and Gatwick Express.
Mr Jeremy Sullivan QC, for Mr Salmon, told the judges that by Friday two of the
franchises would have been let, and asked them not to make a stay on any
signing of contracts.
But Sir Thomas directed: ``We think in the circumstances there should be a stay
from taking any action to sign or announce signing of franchises until delivery
of judgment on Friday.''
Outside the court SOR secretary Keith Bill said that the ``very senior judges''
of the Court of Appeal were taking the issue seriously enough to grant a stay
of the franchise signing to give themselves more time to consider.
Two Scottish bus companies - Stagecoach and FirstBus - are front runners for
two of the franchises on offer.
Perth-based Stagecoach is widely tipped to get South West Trains. FirstBus,
which is based in Aberdeen, is part of a consortium bidding for Great Western
Trains, which runs services from Paddington to Wales and the west of England.

THE Government is still considering whether to pay an estimated #5m
compensation to the builders of the Skye Bridge.
However, it now appears that the company, Miller/Dywidag, may have a valid
claim.
It was confirmed yesterday that permission to start work on the project came
three months later than expected and a month after the final starting date
agreed with the Scottish Office.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, has tabled a series of
Parliamentary questions calling on the Secretary of State to publish the full
terms of the contract.
He is also to ask the Public Accounts Committee to investigate the public
expenditure involved in the project.
Miller/Dywidag was criticised last summer for seeking compensation on the
grounds that the public inquiry had taken too long.
This meant work planned for the summer was delayed into winter when the weather
and sea conditions were far more difficult.
It was announced on November 28, 1991, that a public inquiry would be held and,
shortly afterwards - on December 16, the Scottish Office signed the contract
with Miller/Dywidag.
The inquiry sat on only nine days between January 28 and February 7, 1992.
Work began on the bridge in July, 1992, despite members of the public still
having a legal period in which to appeal against the project.
A company spokes-man said: ``We expected to start work at the end of March, but
the last possible date was the end of May.''
The Herald understands that the company had always been working to the earlier
date - and the Scottish Office knew that.
Yesterday an official spokesman would only confirm May 30 as an agreed start
date. But even that meant the company started a full month after its ``last
possible start date''.
The Herald also understands that the claim is largely based on delays and not -
as has been suggested by the Scottish Office - on the design changes demanded
by the National Trust.
Mrs Kathleen MacRae, of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, said yesterday: ``It was
clear that the Government wanted to avoid a public inquiry. Scottish Office
Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said at the beginning of November, 1991,
that the Government expected work to start within six months.
``That's obviously what was agreed with the company the following month.''
``Given the public inquiry and all the complexities of the project, nobody
would have been surprised if they had been talking about a start date of March,
1993.''

THE director of the Scottish Prison Service and the governor of Cornton Vale
condemned recent media publicity about the prison in the wake of three
suicides. They believed this publicity had been unfair and hurtful to staff who
were working in a caring way with the women.
As the writer of one feature relating to the suicides (February 6), I would
like, in the light of these comments, to raise my own experience, because it is
relevant to the question of what media policy is pursued by the SPS and the
prison itself in order to present a fair picture of the work done with women by
staff.
About two years ago I wished to write features for The Herald, and for a
charity magazine I edit, on the valuable work being developed at Cornton Vale
by the voluntary organisation Apex Scotland in collaboration with staff.
Apex were running courses with the prisoners on employment issues and other
skills valuable to women on release. These were progressive developments with
support and involvement from prison staff, and the feature would have brought
positive publicity to the prison.
I applied through all the proper channels giving written details of my project
and asked if any mutually convenient time could be found. After weeks of delay
I was finally refused permission to visit the prison.

EXCLUSIVE THOUSANDS of tenants in homes owned by Scottish housing associations
could face rent rises because of a little-noticed proposal in last
month's Budget, a financial expert warned yesterday.
The move, if ratified by the Scottish Office, would end the associations'
effective exemption from corporation tax and leave them facing annual bills
costing a total of more than #2m.
Mr Mike Blyth, the Scottish managing partner of chartered accountants Kidsons
Impey, said the change would force housing associations to raise their rents,
or put off maintenance on homes.
He said the Budget had abolished corporation tax relief for all associations
which did not have charitable status. Charities remain exempt from such tax
duties.
The decision seems intended to encourage private housing companies into the
rented sector in England and Wales, by giving them a level playing field with
associations.
In Scotland, non-charitable associations have traditionally received a full
reimbursement of any corporation tax from the Scottish Office, via funding
agency Scottish Homes. The total repaid in 1993/4 was #1.75m, and #2.5m in
1994/5.
About three-quarters of the 200 associations in Scotland, which have about
70,000 tenants, are non-charitable. Their individual annual bills are thought
to range up to #150,000.
However, Mr Blyth said it was now expected that relief would be reduced to
zero, in line with England and Wales.
He pointed out that any surpluses made by associations tended to be invested in
essential upgrading work, such as window replacement or kitchen improvements.
In addition, many had recently undertaken large transfers of whole housing
estates, involving thousands of homes, which had been planned and financed on
the assumption that corporation tax relief would be remain in place.
Mr Blyth said: ``The effects of the 1995 Budget will be felt by the housing
association sector for many years to come. The associations affected will be
forced either to put up rents or forego improvements to their properties.
``The Chancellor has adopted a back-door method to save cash by taking away
grant aid that was extremely important to the majority of housing associations
in this country.
``For many tenants, this move will, almost certainly, more than offset the
personal tax reductions offered in the Chancellor's speech.''
Mr David Orr, the director of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations,
said: ``This proposal is a body blow to Scottish housing associations and has
no justification.
``The changes are being introduced as a consequence of proposed legislation in
England and Wales which will not apply to Scotland."
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Office said yesterday: ``We are still
considering what the most appropriate solution for Scotland would be. There is
no decision yet.''

I AM hardly surprised at the letter from Hugh Craigie Halkett on the minimum
wage issue (December 8).
It is the usual line taken by managing directors - screw wages down, employ
workers part-time on starvation rates, spew forth specious figures about
unemployment in other countries.
Government unemployment figures are improving, but they are just figures and
without substance.
If you have 16 hours' work, you are fully employed. If a man loses a skilled
job at #400 a week and his wife gets a job at some check-out earning a
take-home pay of little more than #30 a week, one job has been lost, one job
has been gained. Unemployment figures would have it that there is no change.
Positions as security guards have been on offer at Ayr Job Centre at #1.80 per
hour and a 72-hour week. How can anyone buy a house or a car or even a pair of
shoes on a wage like that?
Can Conservatives not see that every unemployed person is a customer lost to
every shop in the High Street, one who cannot afford to buy British-made goods
if he buys at all?

A MOTHER of two young children broke down and wept yesterday as a judge told
her she must be jailed for drugs offences.
Lord Hamilton told Susan Bartraham: ``If I were to take a light view I would be
failing in my public duty to take steps to discourage a trade which has caused
so much misery and so much death to a wide number of people.''
Bartraham, 34, a first offender, was convicted at the High Court in Glasgow of
being concerned in the supply of heroin and Temazepam at her home in Liddesdale
Pass, Milton, Glasgow, between March and June last year.
The court was told that Bartraham, who looks after her disabled mother and
grandmother, was paid to keep the drugs at her house over a two-week period.
Lord Hamilton deferred sentence to obtain background reports and said yesterday
at the High Court in Edinburgh that the case had caused him considerable
concern.
He accepted that Bartraham, who has two young daughters, looked after her
family and had never been in trouble before.
The judge added: ``However, you have committed crimes of which this court must
take a very serious view.
Lord Hamilton jailed Bartraham for 18 months and also ruled that #900 found in
the house should be forfeited.

THE right-wing Adam Smith Institute will unveil its successor to state welfare
today in the form of the right to opt-out from state pension and social
security contributions.
People should be free to save into personal, privately-run ``fortune accounts''
designed to provide lifetime insurance and basic pension benefits, according to
authors Eamonn Butler and Madsen Pirie.
Their report argues:
.q.The current pay-as-you-go pension system is not only financially unsound but
``a precarious chain letter''. In effect, today's ``taxpayers are funding
today's pensioners in the hope future taxpapers will in turn fund them.''
.q.The benefits' system is shaped more by the power of vested interest groups
than by actuarial realities. Its impersonal nature not only makes
``contributors resent paying for others but encourages fraud because the
benefits are seen as other people's money''.
The institute is adamant the only way out of the ``pathology'' of the welfare
state is to replace the collective, politicised system with one based on the
so-called fortune accounts.
These would bear the names of individuals, be privately-managed, and provide
savings for retirement and insurance for lifetime needs.
The report declares: ``By contributing a part of their income into their own
account, people will accumulate savings when young, fit, and in work, in order
to fund their needs in retirement or when unempoyed, sick, or disabled.''
It adds that instead of trying and failing to be an insurance company, the
Government would be restricted ``to the purely welfare function of topping up
the accounts of those who cannot afford to contribute themselves''.
The free market institute also proposes extending the funding principle to
social security as well as pensions; regards personal savings ``as a
replacement rather than supplement to the welfare state,'' and wants
individuals' funds managed by competing private providers rather than by the
state.
Citing examples from Chile and Singapore, the authors stress accounts would be
the property of individuals. As such, they could not be eroded by politicians
changing the rules, and people would have less incentive to defraud the system.
Labour's depute Shadow Scottish Secretary John McFall said last night the
institute wanted no state responsibility whatsoever for its citizens. That was
unacceptable, and he added: ``The proposals may be OK for a minority, but for
the majority would increase pecuniary.''
Mr McFall spoke of people being plunged into trouble because of personal
pension arrangements. Although it was acceptable for people to make personal
provisions, there had to be a public-private mix so that everyone was protected.

HEALTH Secretary Stephen Dorrell was accused of mixing his messages yesterday
when he issued new guidelines seen as encouraging people to drink more.
Although it follows expert advice that moderate alcohol consumption can have
health benefits, his announcement was attacked as untimely because of the
efforts being directed against drinking and driving during the festive season.
He has effectively raised the maximum safe drinking levels recommended by the
Government by a third in the case of men and a half in the case of women.
However, Mr Dorrell's decision to serve up the new limits as a daily ration
instead of a weekly total went down smoothly with most critics, since they help
to emphasise the danger of binge drinking.
The new guidelines, developed after consultations with doctors' groups, advise
that men can drink up to four units of alcohol a day without suffering harm,
while women could have up to three units a day.
Until now the upper limits were 21 units a week for men and 14 for women - one
unit of alcohol is a half-pint of normal strength beer or one glass of wine,
although these equivalents become less meaningful when applied to high-strength
beers or to the alcoholic fruit drinks whose use by young people has become a
cause for concern.
The new recommended levels come with publication of a report by an
inter-departmental working group which examined drinking limits.
The report throws in an extra dash of controversy by suggesting that some
teetotallers should take up drinking for its beneficial effects, although Mr
Dorrell watered this down by refusing to recommend it personally.
The notion that a little of what you fancy does you good is based on the effect
of alcohol in dilating the blood vessels - thereby protecting against heart
attacks or strokes - and the observation that moderate drinkers have a lower
mortality than total abstainers, even allowing for those who have given up due
to ill-health.
Daily consumption of one to two units of alcohol ``gives a significant health
benefit,'' reducing heart disease for men over 40 and post-menopausal women,
according to the report.
Mr Dorrell said: ``Alcohol consumption will always be a major public health
issue and it is important for the Government to present a balanced view which
recognises the risks of alcohol but also offers soundly-based and credible
advice on which people can base their own choices.''
The report made very clear that excessive drinking carried significant and
growing health risks, he added. It also showed the need to target specific
messages at different groups of the population, such as pregnant women and
young people.
Transport Minister Steven Norris said the Government's advice on drinking and
driving remained the same: don't drink at all.
Professor Paul Wallace, of the Royal College of General Practitioners, insisted
the new limits were not a green light for heavy drinking. The move from weekly
to daily limits reflected the fact that occasional binge drinking was more
dangerous than regular moderate intake.
The report was also welcomed by Mr Douglas Allsop, director of the Scottish
Council on Alcohol, who said: ``It is not aimed at problem drinkers or people
who are abusing alcohol, but the general population who drink for pleasure and
enjoy it.''
The shift to a daily limit was welcomed by Ms Belinda Lindon, nursing adviser
to the British Heart Foundation, who
also accepted the safety of the new limits.
However, the British Medical Association chairman, Dr Sandy Macara, said:
``Whatever the intention of the Government, relaxing the sensible drinking
limits a week after the launch of the Christmas drink-driving campaign is both
irresponsible and badly timed. The confusing message about daily as opposed to
weekly limits is unhelpful and will be misunderstood and misinterpreted by the
public.''
The alcohol adviser to the World Health Organisation, Dr Peter Anderson, also
condemned the new drinking limits. ``The basic message that the World Health
Organisation is saying in relation to alcohol is that less is better,'' he told
BBC Radio 4's World at One.
He added: ``In my opinion, the scientific evidence would show that if you are
drinking at those levels of alcohol consumption, you are very likely to put
your health at risk.''
Dr Adrian Carr, head of Law, Health and Social Administration, at Bell College,
Hamilton, and an expert on alcohol-related issues, said most people who drank
regularly were already drinking on the limit or above.
``I would take issue with encouraging people to drink,'' he said.
Shadow Health Secretary Harriet Harman criticised the Government for issuing
mixed messages. ``His priority ought not to be to tell people to drink more but
to deal with young people getting drunk, the link between drink and crime and
the still major problem of drinking and driving,'' she said.
Professor Philip Graham, chairman of the Royal College of Physicians and
British Paediatric Association working party on alcohol and the young, pointed
out that relaxing the limits had been opposed earlier this year by three of the
medical Royal Colleges.
Their report document, Alcohol and the Heart in Perspective, ``made it
absolutely clear'' that relaxing the sensible limits guidelines for alcohol
would have detrimental effects on individual risks, he said.

A SOUR note has been introduced into the Kvaerner takeover bid for Amec with
highly regarded public relations firm Financial Dynamics being sacked by the
British company after criticism from the Takeover Panel.
The Norwegian shipbuilding and engineering group had brought in the panel after
press articles appeared over the weekend of December 2-3. These implied that
Amec was about to produce 1996 profit forecasts which were higher than in the
current range of analysts estimates.
The panel said that there had been a conversation between a Financial Dynamics
director and a member of a securities house unconnected with either Amec or
Kvaerner about Amec's profits for 1996 and also contents of the defence
document that were not due to be released for several days.
This breach of the takeover code whereby information must be released to all
shareholders at the same time resulted in two press articles appearing to the
effect that Amec would achieve pre-tax profits in 1996 of about #35m.
In the event, Amec has made only a turnover forecast and said that it was
inappropriate to make one for 1996 profits.
The panel said that Financial Dynamics had failed to take sufficient care in
its discussions with analysts which resulted in serious breaches of the code.
It has been replaced by Dewe Rogerson, best known for privatisation issues.
n.KVAERNER bought the Provident Mutual Life holding of 4.91 million Amec shares
yesterday at the 100p bid price to raise its holding from 20.14% to 22.56%.
The offer closes next Monday but it seems likely that the outcome should be
decided by tomorrow night.

SCOTTISH Amicable Investment Management has thrown its weight behind Granada in
its #3300m hostile bid for the Forte hotels and catering empire.
Last night, chief executive officer Douglas Ferrans said it had been a backer
of Granada's chief executive Gerry Robinson since 1991 and had done very well.
Like him, SAIM believed in cash flow generation and the takeover would create
significant shareholder value. ``It's a cracking deal at this price,'' he said.
Some six million Forte shares and four-and-a-half million Granada are managed
on behalf of clients.
Earlier, Mr Robinson said he had ``very serious doubts'' that Forte had put in
place many of the sales announced since the beginning of the #3300m bid.
But he added that he accepted two things. One was that bankers had been
appointed to sell Travelodge and the other that the 78-strong White Hart hotel
chain had been open to bids.
However, he said Forte should stop the disposals until the end of the bid as it
was against shareholders interests.
Mr Robinson was speaking after yesterday's extraordinary meeting called to
approve the issue of new shares and change the borrowings limit.
That was passed with 40% of shareholders voting in favour and just 0.4% against
- many institutions did not vote on what was a foregone conclusion. Of the 30
or so shareholders and larger number of advisers present, only two voted
against the motion on a show of hands.
Forte revealed in the afternoon that it had sold a hotel in Liege and another
in Majorca for #2.2m as well as offering the Polygon site in Southampton which
has planning permission for offices.
Granada has already complained to the Takeover Panel about the Forte sales
programme but as yet the panel has taken no action.
Mr Robinson, who said he was ``avoiding the temptation'' of sending a Christmas
card to Sir Rocco Forte, charged that the image of Forte as an international
hotel company was belied by the reality.
The Post House chain had been significantly underinvested and some hotels were
in very poor order indeed, while the Little Chef brand was very tired and had
older customers, he said. Under Granada management, he added, he would
introduce fast food in about 100 outlets.
There is no chance of a change of mind on the Savoy which both groups are now
pledged to sell. Forte has a 68% stake which it has used to make management
changes.
Mr Robinson pointed out that in a recent poll, the Savoy had been the only
hotels group to show lower acceptance levels by users. ``I don't think Charlie
(Lord) Forte would have been happy with that.'' He added that sort of trophy
asset did not rest easily in a plc.

MEMBERS of a leading City investment bank yesterday heard they are to receive
bonuses of about #600,000 each.
The 33 London partners of American-owned Goldman Sachs and 20 other key staff
are understood to be in line for the bonus payments on top of their basic
salaries.
Staff at Morgan Stanley, another US investment bank, were also told how much
they would receive in annual bonuses.
The bumper payouts follow an excellent year for investment banks after a record
level of takeover business in the US and Europe which has generated enormous
fees for advisers.
Rising share prices through the year on worldwide stock markets have also
provided a big boost for the major City players such as Goldman.
Goldman said it was not company policy to comment on staff bonuses.
In the UK, takeovers have dominated headlines of the business press throughout
the year. Towering above them all was the #9000m acquisition of drugs group
Wellcome by its bigger rival Glaxo - a record sum for a UK takeover.
In the banking sector, Lloyds was making news with its #1800m takeover of the
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society and more recently, its proposed #5900m
acquisition of TSB.
The landscape of the electricity industry has changed out of all recognition
over recent months as a result of takeovers within the sector, an acquisition
by an American power company and successful bids from two privatised water
companies.
The generous bonus payouts are still below the level in 1993 when about 70
London executives at Goldman Sachs earned $1m (about #653,000) each in
performance-related pay.
Administrative and support staff received a bonus of 30% of basic salary in
1993 against 8% in 1994 and 20% for this year.
A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley said: ``Bonuses paid will be better than in
1994 although not at the same level as in 1993 and reflect improved market
conditions and the upturn in the industry and a tremendous effort by our staff
this year.''

TOMORROW will be a crucial day for BT as it will hear the decision of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) over who should bear the cost of
enabling a consumer to retain an existing number when switching to another
telephony provider.
BT had argued that it was the proprietor of the number and should not have to
pay. The regulator, Don Cruickshank, thought otherwise. When the two cannot
agree on a matter of this sort the MMC has to decide.
BT will be examining the MMC ruling carefully, as if it is favourable to it, or
at least not totally in support of Mr Cruickshank, it will be emboldened to
force another more important issue to the MMC.
This relates to Mr Cruickshank's proposal for a lighter regulatory regime when
it comes up for renewal in 1977. In exchange for allowing BT greater freedom
over pricing, he wants wider authority to stamp on what he sees as
anti-competitive practices as soon as they arise. He feels the present
licensing framework is too rule-bound.
With technology changing so fast rules are out of date by the time they are
written and are complex to the extent of being incomprehensible to anyone but
an expert.
BT certainly likes the idea of having greater pricing freedom but is fearful of
having a regulator with a roving brief. So the issue is likely to end up with
the MMC.
More immediately there is the problem of interconnection charges, the fees
competitors have to pay BT to deliver calls via its network. Then there are
figures relating to interconnect charges for overseas calls into foreign
networks. So Oftel is busy - hyperactive BT would no doubt say.
For domestic consumers the arguments are esoteric and even Mr Cruickshank
accepts that it will take a long time before competitors make major inroads
into BT's market share in this area.
As in the case of mobile phones, he foresees a period of confusion before
comparison between competitors' tariffs and conditions become clearer. He will
be doing his bit by publishing audited figures on quality of service and, in
conjunction with the Consumers' Association, will give details of call charges
to enable comparisons to be made more easily.
Hot property
BRITISH Land is pushing hard on the heels of Britain's biggest property
company, Land Securities, in terms of size and seems certain to provide a more
rewarding dividend flow over the next few years.
Admittedly, there are few surprises in the half-time results after the
announcement last month of the #223m rights issue to buy the outstanding 50% of
the massive Broadgate office development in the City for #120m from the
receiver of Rosehaugh, but that deal means British Land is now the biggest
owner of `A' quality property in the Square Mile.
Chairman John Ritblat has been gearing it up, and after the Broadgate deal has
been completed some 80% of the #4500m portfolio will be less than seven years
old. The implications for future revenue are, therefore, highly favourable
enabling it to reduce its cover to help boost dividends, as it will require
relatively low retentions.
Interim gross rental income leapt 30.6% to #109m, which after sharply higher
interest charges - these rose #19.5m to #63.4m - left the pre-tax total just
5.1% ahead at #24.9m. The dividend is 5.3% higher at 2.78p.
Gearing is probably around 130%. But as the shortage of prime quality property
pushes up capital values, it will fall quite sharply. The company is
renegotiating its loan book at a time of low interest rates.
Future rental income growth is further assured through the recent purchase of
three Scottish retail parks and seven more Tesco supermarkets.
The full-year results will be scrutinised very carefully for the net asset
value which may hold about steady at 420p, with the expectation that it could
rise to about 480p a year later.
The shares closed 6p easier at 368p where they stand at an attractive 13%
discount to net asset value for 1995-96 and almost 25% for the year to March
1997.
Property is not the most popular sector, but this is a stock which should prove
more dependable than most - and a return to inflation would be an added bonus.
Sensible view
THE Greenbury report and proposals on executive pay and perks not surprisingly
upset a number of the so-called fat cats in business who did so much to sour
the scene, particularly over privatisations.
In fact, Sir Richard and his committee had rather expected to be criticised for
being too soft. In the event, while this did happen, there has also been a
distinct campaign to undermine their findings using a variety of arguments.
Interestingly Lord Young, late of Cable &amp; Wireless before being sacked and
currently seeking considerable compensation, who remains president of the
Institute of Directors, has been particularly scathing.
But now Tim Melville-Ross, the IoD's director-general and a member of the
Greenbury Committee, has launched a fierce counter attack against attempts to
block or tinker with individual recommendations of the report which, he claims,
would undermine its overall effectiveness.
Mr Melville-Ross argues that the committee spent a long time trying to get the
balance right. And while not every member agreed with every detailed
recommendation, they all subscribed to the whole.
The result, he maintains, should be recognised for what it is - an important
step forward and a bulwark against wholly unacceptable legislation.
Addressing the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators' dinner at
the Guildhall, he called upon companies to take the high ground in responding
to Greenbury by setting performance measurements and reward systems, using
disclosure of their benefits, and making managers into owners.
He also called for a change of culture surrounding boardroom pay. As with other
investments, investment in executive pay should be scrutinised to maximise the
return, he believes.
Mr Melville contends that we need to develop a view that business is not just
about relatively short-term financial performance, but rather long-term
shareholder gain, which requires other measures of performance than the purely
financial to be taken into account.
Better corporate behaviour at the top will create a new climate and new
standards helpful to all kinds and sizes of business, he concludes.
His views are rugged and sensible and, hopefully, will take precedence over the
growing carping and sniping at Greenbury.

BANK of Scotland is continuing to expand its business base in Australia, this
time in corporate finance.
Its recently established Australian subsidiary BoS International (Australia) is
raising A$750m (#360m) in commercial paper and medium-term notes to set itself
up in the corporate loans business.
The financing package is unconnected with the Bank of Scotland's #437m purchase
of Bank of Western Australia (BankWest) which was completed last month.
BankWest is a retail bank with an extensive branch network, whereas BoS
International handles only large corporate deals.
BoS International has given a mandate to Sydney-based Westpac Banking Corp to
arrange the issue of commercial paper and medium-term notes, thought to be the
first combined deal of this nature in Australia.
Robin Browning, a general manager at Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh, said BoS
would use the proceeds to fund other subsidiaries in Australia such as Scottish
Pacific Business Finance and Capital Corporate Finance.
``In a way, it's sort of a treasury operation in the Bank of Scotland groups,''
Mr Browning said. ``The A$750m is just an additional souce of income to that
which BoS has already raised itself.''
BoS was formed six months ago to take deposits from Australian banks and
companies and arrange large corporate loans.
Bank of Scotland is unconditionally guaranteeing its financial obligations
under the A$750m programme.
Reports that Capital Corporate Finance plans to spend A$200m (#96m) on a Sydney
headquarters for its Asia-Pacific region are premature, Mr Browning said.
There was no firm commitment to spending that amount and such a development
would be ``at least five years down the road'', he said. It would depend on how
quickly Bank of Scotland's Asian operations grew, he added.

<TEXT>
Frankfurt, Tuesday - The Bundesbank is unlikely to succumb to intense political
pressure and reduce official interest rates on Thursday, but a cut to put its
key indicator on track for the new year cannot be ruled out.
Economists said the central bank could accompany a review of its main policy
guide, M3 money supply, with an interest rate cut designed to boost lending and
help M3 grow at a faster clip, invigorating worryingly sluggish economic growth.
But many economists believe the Bundesbank is more likely to delay a reduction
by several weeks, in order to avoid the impression that it was bowing to
escalating political pressure at home and abroad.
The Bundesbank last reduced its discount and Lombard rates by 50 basis points
or half-a-percentage point each, in August in response to weak M3 growth. The
discount rate is now at 3.5% and the Lombard 5.5%.
The central bank's credibility rests in large part on financial market
conviction that its interest rate decisions are designed to keep medium-term
inflation pressures, reflected in M3, in check and thereby protect the mark's
value.
German consumer price inflation was unchanged in November from October and up
1.7% year-on-year.
The Bundesbank argues that moderate inflation and low long-term interest rates
are its best contribution to fostering economic growth. Market fears that it
would tolerate inflation to boost short-term growth would do more damage than
good.
But news last week that German economic growth had ground to a halt in the
third quarter fuelled fears for the economy next year and prompted
unprecedented calls from leading economic institutes and from politicians for a
reduction.
Yesterday, Oskar Lafon-taine, leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party,
led a chorus of calls urging the Bundesbank to cut rates to spur investment and
job creation.
However, economists played down hopes of an immediate cut.
``I see the chances now as fewer than 50% that a reduction will come this
week,'' said Thomas Mayer, economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt.
``The pressure has grown enormously in Germany because of the economy . . . and
in the past the Bundesbank has always defended itself against views it was
responding to the economy (with a rate move,)'' Mayer said.
Economists noted that Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer has said that
monetary policy can do little to jump-start the economy at this point, given
already low rates. In addition, the Bundesbank may fear an interest rate cut
now might awaken speculation it was helping out its neighbour France, and
smoothing the path to this week's crucial European Union summit. France has
been hit by escalating strikes, as the government tightens its budgetary belt
to ensure that the country meets the criteria for a future single European
currency that are likely to be made concrete at the Madrid EU summit.
Gerhard Grebe, economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt, said the Bundesbank
would want to ensure that any rate cut was not seen as greasing the route for
other nations to participate in Europe's single currency project. Mr Tietmeyer
has said that each nation must keep its own fiscal house in order.
The Bundesbank and Germany have also been in the vanguard of the movement to
make sure nations adhere to strict criteria before they may be allowed to join
in the single currency.
Nonetheless, many econo-mists do see a rate cut within the next several weeks
or months. - Reuter.

EXCLUSIVE
THE Burns International Festival is facing a cash crisis and may have to be
radically pruned or even cancelled if more funding cannot be found.
Local authorities, enterprise companies and other funding bodies already
contributing more than #250,000 are to be urged to take a ``leap of faith'' and
come up with around #175,000 more to save the festival, established to mark the
bicentenary of the bard's death.
Festival director John Struthers will be seeking backing from as yet untapped
sources such as Strathclyde region and the Scottish Tourist Board.
It is also understood that the Scottish Office may be asked to assist the
festival, which is facing a serious shortfall because of the reluctance of
commercial sponsors to sign up and the fact that European funding is dependent
on an equal amount of funding being in place.
On the day that the festival announced its initial programme for the ``birthday
season'' - starting in less than three weeks and lasting until May - it emerged
that board members have been warned of serious financial difficulties.
The news is a further damaging blow to the festival company which is running
out of time to secure sponsors for the 12-month programme of events.
Since The Herald disclosed problems within the festival organisation earlier
this year, there has been a series of incidents which have combined to weaken
faith in the festival and embarrass the organisers.
Chairman Eric Rowe left his wife and family to live in England, the day after
helping patron the Princess Royal to launch the festival in Kilmarnock. And top
performers Kiri Te Kanawa, Billy Connolly, and Runrig said they were not
properly consulted prior to being bandied about as potential participants.
Ms Te Kanawa's personal manager Nick Grace said: ``We were approached about
becoming involved. We wanted to know more but there were no further approaches
from the organisers.''
Runrig may yet appear, if the Centrum arena can be completed in time,
increasingly unlikely since owner Mr Bill Barr is still awaiting lottery cash
towards the project.
Meanwhile, there are worries among the local Burns fraternity that the festival
is merely riding piggy back on events which would have gone on anyway.
Sources point to the fact that following the cancellation of the world's
biggest Burns Supper, to be broadcast worldwide by satellite, the festival has
``linked up'' with the 10-year-old Westsound Burns Supper.
Mr Sam Gaw, world president of the Burns Federation, said: ``It is
disappointing to note that some of the events put forward as festival events
are in fact already organised.''
Mr Struthers said: ``We were always in existence to provide a catalyst and to
promote and support events. There is nothing wrong with the fact that some of
the events in the festival programme are not solely the work of the festival
organisers.''

COMPASS, the largest European-owned catering group, has sold its healthcare
division to its management for #178.8m, which is dependent on the level of net
assets prior to completion, writes NICOLA REEVES.
The bulk of the purchase price, just under #171m, will be paid in cash with the
remainder in a secured loan. Finance for the management buy-out was provided by
CINVen.
Compass Healthcare provides a range of healthcare services in the UK. It
operates 15 private hospitals offering acute surgical and medical care, two
nursing homes and a healthcare screening business. In the year to October 1,
1995, it made an operating profit of #15.8m on turnover of #69.7m. The net
asset value of the division was #128.8m.
The disposal was expected given the strong international growth of Compass's
catering business. Last year, Compass's sales were #1505.8m of which #1436.1m
was derived from catering and related activities. The proceeds of the disposal
will be used to reduce borrowings incurred following Compass's acquisition of
the catering group Eurest for #580m in September.
Group chief executive Francis Mackay said the disposal was ``a natural
extension'' of Compass's long-standing strategy of focusing on the development
of its core international catering operations.

FIVE-year contracts to maintain Scotland's trunk road network have been awarded
to three local authority consortia.
Scottish Roads Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton yesterday described the
council bids as ``very good value for money'' and said they had been successful
in an open competition for the work.
The winning bids were submitted by the Tay Local Authority Consortium for the
Tay Premium Unit roads; the Forth Local Authority consortium for the Forth
Premium Unit and the Clyde Local Authority Consortium for the Clyde Premium
Unit.
The contracts will become effective on April 1, following local government
reorganisation.
The roads are currently maintained by regional councils under agency agreements
with the Secretary of State.

THE Tory Party is keen that Britain should be seen as the enterprise economy of
Europe. Therefore it will no doubt enthusiastically support Project Business
(UK), launched by the charity Young Enterprise earlier this week.
Indeed Lord Henley, the Education and Employment minister said he was confident
that it would prove to be attractive to teachers and students and would
establish itself in schools and colleges.
The project aims to introduce 14-16 year old students to the world of business
and economics in an exciting and innovative way. It forms a close working
partnership between education and business, involving business volunteers
working with teachers, both in their classrooms and in their companies.
In recent years there have been concerns expressed about the relevance of much
of what is learned in school. The rapid pace of technological change has
heightened such concerns. Project Business (UK) will be particularly welcomed
by those interested in promoting vocational education.
Just as work placements are meant to provide students with an idea of how they
might have to apply their skills in the workplace, so Project Business is meant
to give students practical experience in the form of a business or works visit
and through structured classroom sessions, an insight into the different
aspects of British business. Issues covered in the programme include the role
of the consumer, advertising and the workings of the market economy.
Currently funding of #250 is needed to support each Project Business (UK)
class, typically involving a partner, a teacher and 25 students. The money goes
towards the partners' manuals, student workbooks, training, local support and
registration. Funding may be provided by the business partners' company or
other local agencies.
Companies supporting the programme include Unilever, W H Smith and GEC. The
Department for Education and Employment contributed towards the initial pilot
project and co-sponsored the extended pilot. Next month a similar pilot project
begins in Scotland.
More and more people are recognising the usefulness of closer links between
schools and businesses. Nine out of ten young people are now thought to take
part in work experience before they leave school. Over 90% of secondary schools
have links with local businesses and over 170,000 teachers have had placements
in business since 1989.
Educational programmes such as Projects Business (UK), given at a young age,
are needed now more than ever given the breakdown of the traditional labour
market and the subsequent increase in self-employment and flexible working.
Teachers as much as pupils need to understand the changing needs of business
and industry so that they can be better equipped to meet those needs.
Small firms are the key to future employment growth and provide a more amenable
working environment for many people, particularly women trying to balance the
demands of work and family life.
Skills which can help young people to successfully set up and run their own
business are useful at a time when increasing numbers of graduates are leaving
school and universities only to find that there are not enough jobs to go round.

TRADING prospects for the medium and long term were very good, industrial
conglomerate Hanson announced yesterday.
In the group's annual report, chairman Lord Hanson said that while a softening
in several parts of the UK economy was having an impact on some of its UK
businesses, the US remained vigorous.
He believed the group's future growth and development lay in chemicals,
consumer products, energy, building materials and equipment businesses. It also
intended to concentrate on fewer, larger interests and sell a number of
businesses.
``The year to come will see further corporate activity substantially to reduce
debt and deliver value to shareholders,'' added Lord Hanson.
The annual report shows Lord Hanson's pay packet inched ahead in the year to
September 30 to #1,374,000 from #1,362,000 in the previous 12 months.

ABOUT 350 workers at the HarperCollins' book manufacturing plant at
Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow, looks set to accept a 9.5% wage cut and a
compensation package rather than face losing their jobs.
The workers had been told that the plant would close on Friday unless they
accepted a deal by 5pm today.
However, The Herald understands the deadline has been extended until Friday at
1pm for workers to accept the proposals put forward on Monday by Mr Chris
Hardie, the prospective owner of the manufacturing plant, and Mr Eddie Bell,
HarperCollins's executive chairman.
The company has agreed to offer an 18-month compensation package which would be
worth between #2000 and #3000 per person before tax and which would be payable
on January 5 if the 9.5% wage cut is accepted.
Staff previously unanimously rejected a 25% wage cut proposed by Mr Hardie, the
owner of a small Berwick-based company, Martins the Printers, which employs 30
people.
It is understood that union legal advisers have warned workers that they would
have problems in winning unfair dismissal claims if they were paid off.
HarperCollins has also warned that the Government minimum redundancy package
would be paid in the event of closure.
No-one from HarperCollins or the Graphic, Paper and Media Union, which
represents most of the workers, was available for comment last night.

BPROFESSOR George Browning, the ear, nose and throat surgeon who was found to
have the HIV virus almost a year ago, has asked to be allowed to resume
operating on patients.
Professor Browning, who is based at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, said last night
that the type of surgery he performed was recognised as relatively low-risk.
He is a specialist in what is virtually keyhole surgery inside the ear, using
instruments manipulated by remote control.
Three months after the diagnosis last Christmas Professor Browning returned to
work, but did not resume operating on patients. He has held out-patient clinics
and continues to teach at Glasgow University.
He has now asked a Department of Health advisory committee, which looks at
cases of doctors with HIV or other potientially dangerous infections or risk
factors, to look at his case.
``They have said they will consider it, and that is as far as it has gone,'' he
said.
Professor Browning added: ``My patients have been very positive, and a number
of those for whom I have recommended surgery have said they would be willing to
have me operate on them.''
After he had recovered from the illness that led to the infection being
detected, he had been encouraged to return to work.
``I am now keeping very good health, the waiting lists are going up, and I have
a skill to offer which people might want to use.''

A CAMPBELTOWN congregation of the Church of Scotland has been declared to be in
``an unsatisfactory state'' and its minister has been suspended after an
investigation.
The Presbytery of South Argyll made the decision at a special meeting on Monday
because of a breakdown in relations between the Rev Donald Lawrie and members
of his Highland congregation.
Mr Lawrie was inducted to the Campbeltown Highland parish four years ago as his
first ministry. He will be appealing against the judgment to the judicial
commission of the General Assembly.
Mr Lawrie, who declined to comment yesterday, will continue to receive his
salary for an unspecified period whether or not his appeal is successful. The
affairs of the congregation will be administered meantime by a minister
appointed by the presbytery.
Insiders of the South Argyll Presbytery say they had been expecting such an
outcome.
Some blamed the Kirk, which cut the number of churches in Campbeltown and made
it inevitable that Mr Lawrie's workload would involve him in requests for
services from those who were not practising Christians.
Others cite Mr Lawrie's attitude to baptism and marriage. He  is understood to
have inflexible views.

THE Government's prospect of staying in office until April 1997 suffered a
further blow yesterday with the death of Sir David Lightbown, MP for South-east
Staffordshire.
The MP, who was 63, suffered a heart attack while attending the
Oxford-Cambridge university rugby match at Twickenham.
His death cuts the Government majority in the Commons to five over all other
parties and Labour looks well-placed to win the by-election. His winning margin
over Labour at the last election was 7192 which, in the current climate of
opinion, looks highly vulnerable.
With another by-election pending in the safe Labour seat of Hemsworth, two
Labour victories would cut Mr Major's majority back to three. Actuarial
calculations indicate that the Prime Minister will be fortunate to face no
other by-elections before April 1997 when the present Parliament ends.
Conservative spokesmen pointed out that the Government habitually enjoys the
support in important votes of Sir Richard Body, the MP for Holland with Boston
in Lincolnshire, who resigned the Tory whip over Europe.
The Prime Minister expressed his shock and sadness at the sudden death of Sir
David who until recently had been a formidable member of the Government's team
of whips.
A massive man whose bulk could be overpowering, he was nicknamed the Terminator
because of his uncompromising approach to Tory rebels. He played a leading role
in keeping many doubting MPs in line during the voting on the Maastricht Treaty
Bill.
Mr Greg Knight, the deputy chief Government whip, said: ``I am very upset. He
was a whip par excellence and also a great character. Although the press
reported many stories of his strong-arm tactics I don't think anyone he cajoled
didn't have increased respect for him.''
Commons Leader Tony Newton said Sir David was ``a great Parliamentary character
who will be missed on both sides of the House''.
Sir David put on about a stone in weight to his already formidable 17 stones
after leaving the whips office last summer.
He was elected an MP in 1983 after a career in local politics and joined the
whips office in 1986. He is survived by his wife Ann.
A by-election in the neighbouring Mid Staffordshire constituency halfway
through the last Parliament resulted in a resounding Labour victory against an
even larger Tory majority. However, the Conservatives recaptured the seat at
the 1992 General Election.
Party sources were putting a brave face on the by-election prospects saying
they expected to continue putting their legislation through the Commons
``without difficulty''.
But the party failed to win any seats up in last May's local elections for
Tamworth borough council which covers the largest part of the constituency.
They also lost 16 seats and forfeited control to Labour in Lichfield district
council part of which is in the constituency. The Conservatives have not won a
by-election since Richmond in Yorkshire in February 1989.

PRESSURE was mounting last night for Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley to
take action over beleaguered National Lottery watchdog chief Peter Davis and
for lottery firm GTech to ``sue or shut up'' in response to a bribery
allegation.
Labour said Mr Davis, director general of Oflot, had put his position ``in
question'' by admitting that he took free flights from GTech, a major investor
in lottery operator Camelot.
And Virgin tycoon Richard Branson challenged GTech to ``let the courts decide''
the truth of his claim that he was offered a bribe by the American firm's
chairman.
But Mrs Bottomley said she would wait for a full committee report - which may
not be delivered until March - before making any decision about Mr Davis's
position.
And GTech said it would not be hurried into a decision over legal action.
Shadow Heritage Secretary Jack Cunningham said Mr Davis compromised his
position by taking flights in GTech private jets and is writing to Mrs
Bottomley asking what action she plans to take.
Mr Davis, who said his decision to fly in GTech private jets saved taxpayers'
money, was keeping a low profile yesterday after his admission to a Commons
committee.
Mr Davis is taking legal advice over the allegations made by Mr Branson in
Monday's Panorama programme. The Virgin boss claimed he had informed Mr Davis
of the bribe allegedly offered by Mr Guy Snowden, chief of GTech, which has a
22% stake in lottery operator Camelot.
Oflot insisted that the claim that Mr Branson told Mr Davis ``was untrue''. Mr
Snowden has already vehemently rejected the ``grossly defamatory and totally
untrue'' bribery allegation and said he was ``reviewing legal options''.

<HEADLINE>Electricity companies announce new batch of job losses as cost cutting continues ScottishPower sacks 350 at Manweb</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT POWELL</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

SCOTTISHPOWER plans to sack a further 350 staff at its English subsidiary
Manweb over the next 12 months, in addition to 1000 laid off by Manweb's former
management earlier this year.
The axe will fall hardest on administrative staff at Manweb's headquarters in
Chester which will be moved to smaller premises.
ScottishPower is determined to streamline the management of the company which
it acquired two months ago in a hostile #1130m takeover bid.
The financial implications of the latest job cuts, which will reduce Manweb's
workforce to about 3000, will be spelt out next month.
``We thought it was important to give our employees an early indication of the
transition team's findings,'' said ScottishPower chief executive Ian Robinson.
``We are currently finalising our detailed plans and it remains our intention
to make full presentation of these in mid-January.''
ScottishPower hinted that in the longer term there could be even more job
losses at Manweb. The company referred to ``an initial reduction in the next 12
months of about 350 jobs,'' implying further cuts might follow.
The company has, meanwhile, made a better-than-expected #27m profit from the
sale of Manweb's 4.8% stake in National Grid, the high-voltage power
transmission network serving England and Wales.
It valued Manweb's holding in the grid at #141m when it launched a takeover bid
for the power company serving Merseyside and North Wales in July. But it sold
the stake for #168m when National Grid was floated on the Stock Exchange on
Monday.
ScottishPower achieved a price of 208p per share, a whisker less than the
National Grid's closing price of 209!sp on its first day of trade.
Some City analysts had said ScottishPower, which sold its shares in a joint
offering with North West Water, would be lucky to get 200p.
The #27m profit on the sale will reduce ScottishPower's debt gearing more
rapidly than anticipated.
Gearing soared to more than 100% when the Glasgow-based company bought Manweb
in October. It was due to come down to 75% by the end of the financial year in
March, but the windfall gain could reduce it to about 60% by then.
But the City ignored the cost reductions that will flow from the job cuts and
the shares windfall. ScottishPower shares closed down 2p at 365p in line with
the generally weaker trend in electricity stocks.
ScottishPower welcomed a decision by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
industry regulator, to lift price caps on electricity sold into the English and
Welsh pool.
Two years ago National Power and PowerGen voluntarily undertook to cap the
price at which they sell power into the pool which, in turn, sells electricity
to the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales.
But Professor Littlechild said yesterday pool prices had remained comfortably
below the ceilings set. He, therefore, saw no reason to maintain the
restrictions, particularly since National Power and PowerGen are selling off
6000 megawatts of their generating capacity - a move that will increase
competition.
ScottishPower will derive marginal benefit from this since it supplies less
than 1.5% of all power sold into the pool. Even so, a company spokesman said:
``Anything that removes artificial constraints on the wholesale market is to be
welcomed.''
ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric should be able to sell more
electricity south of the Border in two years time, once the capacity of the
inter-connector power line to England is upgraded to 2200 megawatts from its
present 1200.

<HEADLINE>Team formed to tender for missile</HEADLINE>

A GROUP of more than 100 British companies has been formed, under the
leadership of the US Hughes electronics and aircraft corporation, to
co-ordinate a bid for a new air-launched missile which will give the Royal Air
Force stealth capability at bargain prices.
The group, known as Team Airhawk, includes Hughes   Microelectronics Europa
Ltd, of Glenrothes, Fife, which has already gained a #2m contract to supply
test equipment and other parts for the UK version of the Tomahawk cruise
missile.
The deal with the Scottish firm marks the first production work on the missile
outside North America. HMEL has a workforce of 700 and an order book worth #60m
in the current year.
The Airhawk will be designed as an entirely British modification of the
missiles which struck targets in Iraq during the Gulf War and more recently
were used to bombard the Bosnian Serbs.
The consortium has been set up in response to a Defence Ministry invitation to
tender for a conventionally-armed, precision-guided missile capable of being
launched from aircraft at ranges of up to 400 miles from target.
Mr Stephen McElroy, director of the Airhawk programme, said last night: ``This
value-for-money weapon will give the RAF's strike aircraft the same
survivability as stealth aircraft with smart munitions. The Airhawk can be
launched beyond the reach of air defences, allowing aircraft and crews to avoid
the risk of being shot down over their targets.''
Meanwhile, orders for Scottish-based electronics companies dropped for the
first time in five years in the quarter leading up to December, according to
figures released by Scottish Engineering, the employers' federation.
Mr Howard Jordan, SE's chief executive, said last night: ``Even during the
worst downturn of the early 90s, the electronic sector was a solid standby. The
only heartening thing is that although companies are reporting a drop in
orders, there has been no corresponding drop in production.''
.q.Motorola is to shed 500 of the 3000 jobs at its Livingston plant, it was
claimed last night.
The move is understood to affect mainly part-time workers and is seen as a
response to the sudden fragility of the semi-conductor market. Nobody from
Motorola could be contacted for comment.

NORTHERN Electric revealed further heavy job losses as it reported a small fall
in profits and confirmed its special 56.5p dividend to be paid in February
1997, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Up to 800 jobs are expected to go by the end of the decade as the group
continues to cut costs. The move follows the #500m package for shareholders in
the ``scorched earth'' defence against the bid from Trafalgar House, which
started off the auction of the English regional electricity companies.
Northern's profits dipped #4.7m to #58.7m in the six months to September owing
to the one-off costs of the defence package, a property disposal in 1994 and
higher financing costs. The job losses are expected to be through natural
wastage.
The group re-affirmed its intention to pay current year dividends totalling
39.9p and an interim of 12p, up 7%, is declared. Its intention is to grow
dividends by 7% a year until 1999 or the year 2000, subject to maintaining
satisfactory dividend cover.
This implies an underlying trading improvement if the group is to overcome the
higher financing charges which will result from its gearing up to pay for the
shareholders' package, at a time of increasing competition in the industry.
Chairman David Morris said it had made further progress in cutting costs, with
operating costs down almost 10% in real terms. He added: ``Our policy of
maximising shareholder value will remain absolute while we continue to manage
the business in an increasingly competitive market place.''

THE two French airmen shot down and held captive by the Bosnian Serbs for more
than 100 days flew home to a heroes' welcome yesterday, clearing the way for a
peace ceremony to end the conflict.
President Jacques Chirac and Defence Minister Charles Millon greeted Captain
Frederic Chiffot and Lieutenant Jose Souvignet at an air base near Paris.
They were flown from Serbia in the plane of the chief of staff of the French
armed forces.
Their return followed French threats of action against their captors. The peace
treaty, formally ending the war in Bosnia, should now be signed in Paris
tomorrow.
After meeting their families, and before heading for Paris for a medical
check-up, they told reporters they ``felt fine''.
The two men were shot down on August 30, following Nato air raids against the
Bosnian Serbs. The men, who had not been seen in public since their Mirage 2000
was blown out of the sky near the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale, were handed
over to France's armed forces chief at the Bosnian-Serbian border.
They were handed over by Bosnian Serb military commander General Ratko Mladic.
He told them he wished them ``a fast recovery . . . and I wish you to be pilots
again but for planes of peace''.
They were flown from the border town of Zvornik to Belgrade and then on to
Paris.
``I was treated quite well as you can see,'' Lieutenant Souvignet said in
Zvornik. ``I had some pain in my leg but they had very good doctors.''
Both suffered leg injuries when they baled out of their fighter jet after it
was hit by the Bosnian Serb missile.
There had been speculation that General Mladic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic held the airmen either to press for changes in the Bosnia peace
agreement or as an insurance policy against their arrest for war crimes.
France denied there had been any deal.

CITY centre retailers across Scotland have reported buoyant sales in the run up
to Christmas. Edinburgh is likely to have its best ever festive sales figure
and in Glasgow takings are up by almost a third in some outlets.
Mr Chris Blake, chairman of the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce retail group,
said: ``After a fairly slow autumn season it's now coming good. It could be our
best Christmas ever, given the way things are going at the moment.''
He said extended shopping hours, Sunday trading and a full weekend before
Christmas Day would contribute further to the surge.
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and the Glasgow City Centre Association (GCCA) have
carried out an informal survey of retailers. The results, released yesterday,
showed that sales levels were either ``well above'' or ``just above'' the same
period last year.
Dundee city centre manager Gordon Reid said informal discussions with managers
from the big stores showed a ``consistently high level of performance''.
Mr John Michie, treasurer of the Aberdeen City Centre Association and board
member of the city chamber of commerce, said he was optimistic that it would
prove to be a successful year.

<HEADLINE>Thriving hotels division on lookout for acquisitions as casino income drops slightly Stakis checks in higher profits</HEADLINE>

THE hotel industry has been set alight by Granada's recent hostile bid for
Forte.
Whoever emerges victorious, the likely fallout from the bid is being closely
monitored by others in the industry, including Stakis which is on the lookout
for more provincial hotel acquisitions.
However, it is not prepared to pay what it deems to be high prices - which is
why it did not buy the Copthorne chain recently sold to the Singapore-based CDL
Hotels group.
Stakis itself is confident of growing its hotels business by another 20% in the
next two years. In 1995 it was active in the development of the business,
adding 615 rooms to its portfolio, including 74 in East Kilbride, taking the
total to just under 5000.
A combination of increased occupancy, up 2.4% to 72.1%, and higher room rates,
up 5.5% to just under #44.00, enabled the hotels division to increase its
profits by 26.5% to #31.2m. Margins, at 29.9%, were just short of the company's
30% target.
Chief executive David Michels said the group had the highest provincial
occupancy and margins in the UK. He attributed this to good locations,
well-refurbished units and good marketing.
In contrast, profitability in the casinos division slipped by 7%, or #800,000,
to #11.7m. New units in Bournemouth and the Isle of Man made higher profits but
the rest of the business declined. A number of factors were cited for this,
among them competition from the National Lottery, the introduction of guest
charges, since withdrawn, and a drop in the average spend of its 1000 biggest
customers. The hot summer is also likely to have reduced attendance.
The board is confident increased promotional activity, the withdrawal of guest
charges, and the creation of attractive purpose-built casinos in more appealing
locations, such as the Riverboat Casino on the Clyde in Glasgow, will benefit
the business in the year ahead.
Mr Michels also called for a level playing field for all gambling vis-a-vis the
National Lottery and for a change to what he described as ``archaic
legislation''.
Given a free market, he said casino attendance in the UK, currently at 2% of
the population, would rise closer to the 30% seen in the US. He added the group
had ``strong faith in the casino business for the future''.
In January, a White Paper on the casino industry is due to be published by the
Government.
Despite the active capital programme, the balance sheet remains strong. Free
cashflow at the year-end was #21.2m.
Generation of such cash is seen as a major driver of future growth in the
business, together with the addition of features such as leisure clubs and more
bedrooms. Capital expenditure of around #23m has been pencilled in for the
hotel division next year with #18m to be spent on extensions.
Overall group profits grew by 28% to #25.8m before tax. Chairman Richard
Cole-Hamilton said it was ``a very good set of figures''. However, Stakis
shares dipped 3p to 79p.

THE US trade picture improved last quarter as the current account deficit
narrowed by nearly 9% to $39.5bn.
The Commerce Department said the deficit dropped as US exports of goods and
services rose, while imports fell.
The current account is the broadest-based of all government's trade statistics
since it covers investments as well as trade in goods and services.
In the second quarter, the deficit was $43.3bn, just shy of the record set in
the final three months of last year.
Much of last quarter's improvement came in merchandise trade, a chronic weak
point for the United States.
The department said the merchandise trade deficit - basically the shortfall
between exports and imports of goods - fell to $43.4bn in the third quarter
from $48.8bn in the second.
Analysts said US companies have become more competitive on world markets as
they have pruned staff and spent money on computers and other capital equipment.
However, in a sign of potential trouble ahead, the Commerce Department said the
US deficit on investment income widened to $4200m in the third quarter from
$2600m in the second.
For many years, the United States had run a surplus in that area, as it earned
more money on its investment abroad than foreigners did on theirs in America.
But the huge increase in the US budget deficit in the 1980s turned the United
States into a net debtor nation, so that it now owes more abroad than it takes
in. - Reuter.

ON the day that Whitbread Inns forecast the disappearance of 5000 pubs out of a
UK total of 58,000 by the year 2005, regional brewer Vaux came out with figures
which added hard evidence, writes ANDREW WILSON.
The north east of England company has been victim of the closure of the Durham
coalfields as well as Calais-based illegal imports.
In recent years, it has unknowingly added to its problems by buying tenancies
where the incumbents cannot afford to upgrade their properties to meet the
competition from brewer backed managed houses at a time when beer volumes are
declining and there is alternative uses for disposable income such as the
inexcrable scratchcard. So Vaux is now switching over to managed houses and
spending more on upgrading, particularly on good sites to attract substantial
volumes.
As a result, 41 pubs were either sold or closed last year with another 41 to
share the same fate this time round to reduce the total to about 750 outlets
while over a two year period, about 70 will be transferred into management.
That had helped restrain the increase in group pre-tax profits last year to
8.7% at #31.8m with tenancies producing #1.5m less at #14.6m. However half that
was recouped in Vaux Inns.
Brewing and wholesaling managed a slight gain with a lower volume of commodity
brewing for Tesco.
The star performance came from Swallow Hotels with profits up by a quarter at
#19.7m. That was helped by higher occupancy at 67.8% and a 12% greater yield
thanks to the brand being seen as offering good four star value. The impetus
came from the London properties helped by burgeoning tourism with turnover
growth double that in the Scottish hotels.
St Andrews nursing homes, which saw two more Scottish openings in Arbroath and
Dundee, were held back by higher front end costs and leasing charges - but that
is simply prudent accounting. Demography is onside as the aged population grows.
Conservative accounting also led to a #12.1m reduction in the valuation of the
pub estate and so Vaux is unlikely to give any nasty shocks on the property
front.
The dividend total has been raised 3.6% to 10.2p with a 6.75p final for a 5%
yield with the shares down 12p at 252p.

<TEXT>
VILLAGERS battling to keep an ancient Celtic cross in the village where it has
stood for 1000 years took their fight to a public inquiry yesterday.
The Dupplin Cross, which overlooks the village of Forteviot in Perthshire, was
erected to celebrate the union of the Scots and the Picts in the ninth century.
The cross is one of the finest early Christian crosses in Scotland and features
intricate Latin script.
Villagers and experts are agreed that the cross, which has become badly eroded,
should be moved indoors but the two camps disagree on an appropriate site for
the stone.
The National Museums of Scotland wants the cross to be the centrepiece of the
new National Museum in Edinburgh but villagers, who have formed the Friends of
the Dupplin Cross action group, say the stone should stay as close as possible
to its original location.
Yesterday, Lord Forteviot, the chairman of the Dupplin Trust, which owns the
cross, told the inquiry that to move the ancient stone to the National Museum
was the only way the safeguard its future.
He said: ``It was obvious to me that the condition of the cross has been
deteriorating for some time and that this deterioration appeared to be
accelerating.''
He added: ``I understand the feelings of those opposed to moving the cross to
Edinburgh and my initial instinct as a local person also is to share these
feelings.
``But the transfer of ownership of the cross to the National Museums of
Scotland provides a permanent arrangement for preserving the cross and ensuring
that it will be kept safe and available for public display in perpetuity.''
National Museums of Scotland curator Dr Mike Spearman told the inquiry that the
cost of moving was expected to be #56,000 and that National Museums of Scotland
was prepared to spend a further #16,000 on a replica cross to be placed on the
site of the original.
But the Friends of the Dupplin Cross maintain that the ancient sculpture should
remain as close as possible to the original site. They want the cross to be
housed in Forteviot church where, they say, it could become a tourist
attraction and a focal point for worship.
The action group has enlisted the support of Historic Scotland and has formed
an alternative plan to house the cross in St Serf's church in Dunning.
The group and Historic Scotland are expected to give evidence to the inquiry
today.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth's plan to cap water charges next year was
yesterday branded an elaborate fraud by the Labour Party.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said it was becoming clear that the
price that would be paid for lower water charges would be cuts in council
services and increases in council tax.
As the Herald exclusively revealed last month, Mr Forsyth plans to cap
increases by the three new public authorities at an average of 6% next year.
Although the water authorities will take control of the council-run services
next April, the new unitary council authorities will still be responsible for
sending out water bills and for ensuring the charges are collected.
They will be paid for the service by the water authorities.
In a letter to Mr Forsyth, Mr Robertson claims the capping can only be achieved
if some of the administrative costs for billing and collection are passed to
the new unitary councils.
He asks Mr Forsyth: ``Will you confirm that instead of compensating Scotland's
council's in full for the administrative costs of this service, you propose to
limit the amount of money they receive - thereby passing some of the costs on
to local tax payers?''
Mr Robertson is also seeking confirmation that the price cap could not be
achieved but for the fact that councils will be obliged to meet any shortfall
created by non payment of water charges.
Last night the Scottish Office confirmed that a maximum charge by councils to
the water authorities of 4% of the amount collected had been proposed in a
consultation paper.
A spokesman said delayed payment and non-payment had also been taken into
account in a formula produced after working discussions with Cosla.

LAST month they were embroiled in war, last night former Yugoslav states were
drawing up battle plans for victory on the football field.
The 1998 World Cup final sections put Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia, three of
the five separate states from the now fractured Yugoslav republic, in the same
group.
But Bosnian trainer Faruk Hadzibegic said: ``We're just happy to play in the
World Cup. The fact that we play Croatia and Slovenia changes nothing. In fact,
it's a pleasure.
``We will play with the whole Bosnian people behind us thinking only of victory
and not of politics.''
Marko Ilesic, vice-president of Slovenian federation said: ``I don't think
there will be much interference from politics in the group and we're guaranteed
big crowds.''
Scotland face Sweden, who beat them in a friendly earlier this season, as well
as Austria, and another three of the former Soviet Union sides, Belarus and the
Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia in a six-team group.
In soccer rivalry terms, there could have been little more dramatic than Italy
and England meeting in a tough group which also includes Poland, Georgia and
Moldova.
Only group winners are certain to qualify for the World Cup finals in France in
1998.
Italy, three times winners and finalists last year, and England, champions in
1966, met in the third place playoff at the Italian World Cup in 1990 when
Italy won 1-0.
Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi said: ``Our group is very hard. England and Poland
are very good teams. England have strong players but I hope Italy will be
stronger and finish first.''
In a World Cup draw which threw up a number of interesting clashes between
European neighbours, Belgium appeared in the same group as the Netherlands and
the Czech Republic were drawn against Slovakia.

A CAR bomb killed at least 15 people and wounded more than 40 in a suburb of
the Algerian capital Algiers today.
The booby-trapped vehicle was parked near a cafe in Ain Naadja suburb. Several
of the wounded were in serious condition, state-run media reported, adding that
Interior Minister Mustapha Ben Mensour had rushed to the scene.
The bomb was the most bloody attack since last month's presidential election
which the authorities saw as a first step to ending nearly four years of
conflict with Muslim fundamentalists seeking to overthrow them.

Nablus, Tuesday
LOUDSPEAKERS played the once-outlawed Palestinian national anthem, ``Biladi''
(My Country), throughout the city. Palestinian flags waved everywhere.
Thousands danced in the streets in their pyjamas, in the rain.
Residents of Nablus, in the West Bank, said the day Israeli troops left after
28 years of occupation was the happiest day of their lives.
``We heard the redeployment started so we rushed out of our houses to go and
watch the celebrations. We never felt happier than today,'' said Sahar
Istetiyeh, a 40-year-old teacher, standing in the chilly rain in her nightgown.
The fact the Israelis left suddenly last night, 48 hours before they were
scheduled to redeploy under a peace deal with the PLO, threw the city into a
state of delighted confusion.
The Palestinian police force that was supposed to take over security from the
Israelis wasn't there yet. City leaders improvised, deploying municipal police
to maintain order in the interval.
The Israelis had been gone for hours and the streets were already crowded with
revellers when people started to decorate the city with colourful lights and
banners prepared for the handover.
``I was surprised when I heard on the loudspeakers and the streets they had
already redeployed,'' said Abdel Rahim al-Maani, 46. ``I immediately put on my
scarf and went out in the cold and it was drizzling and despite the rain and
the cold I went out to join the people in this historic moment.
``It was like a dream, a dream come true,'' he said.
Evacuated offices of the military government drew crowds who wished to see them
empty of the signs of occupation. Former prisoners hugged and kissed in the
empty rooms of the military court and prisons.
Abu Dalal al-Afghani toured the evacuated prison building and said: ``I spent
12 years in this prison, but being here today means that every wound that bled
in this place has healed now, since our land which we fought for is back with
us.''-Reuter.

Relaxing the sensible drinking limits a week after the launch of the Christmas
drink driving campaign is both irresponsible and badly timed            BMA
chairman Dr Sandy Macara
SOMEONE should give the Government a lesson in timing. The week before the
booziest fortnight of the year and the week after launching a #1m anti drink
driving campaign, HMG has seen fit to put out a message which at first sight
looks like a green light for heavy drinking. It even contains an exhortation to
abstainers to think about taking up drinking on health grounds.
``Wrong message, bad timing'' read the stark headline on the British Medical
Association's statement in response to the news that the Department of Health
is to raise the recommended maximimum alcohol intake limits. ``Relaxing the
sensible drinking limits a week after the launch of the Christmas drink driving
campaign is both irresponsible and badly timed,'' said BMA chairman Dr Sandy
Macara.
Mr Mark Bennett, spokesman for the lobby group Alcohol Concern, said: ``Nobody
thinks they're drinking too much. A lot of people will think they are being
given the green light to drink more this Christmas.'' His argument is that
encouraging moderate drinking risks sending the wrong message to heavy
drinkers, especially during the ``season of good cheer''.
Even those who welcome the new guidelines believe the timing of the
announcement is inept to say the least. Mr Douglas Allsop, executive director
of the Scottish Council on Alcohol, said the statement reflected a growing
recognition that the old limits were simply not credible but added: ``Perhaps
they would have been better to delay this until January.''
So what does Health Minister Stephen Dorrell think he is up to? Those keen on
conspiracy theories will be quick to accuse the Department of Health of caving
in under pressure from the enormously powerful drinks industry, aided and
abetted by the Treasury. The key statistic here is the #6000m a year the
Government collects from taxes on alcohol. An extra loud ring from the till of
every off-licence and pub this Christmas would suit the agenda of a tax-cutting
Government very nicely thank you.
In fact, yesterday's announcement is the culmination of a long and careful
weighing up of not only the various risks associated with alcohol abuse but
also the health benefits linked with of moderate alcohol consumption. The key
word here is ``moderate''.
Many studies have shown that drinking a small amount can reduce the risk of
heart attacks in older men and post-menopausal women. For example, in one
American study, 340 heart attack victims were questioned and compared with a
control group. Those who consumed one to three units of alcohol per day had
half the heart attack risk of those who never drank.
Other studies have shown a similar daily intake might also offer limited
protection from strokes, gallstones, and some types of diabetes. However,
consuming more than three drinks per day did not appear to lower the risk
further.
``After a certain point, there's an increasing problem that you're buying
protection against cardio-vascular disease at the cost of something else -
neurological damage, cancer of the oesophagus, social damage, accidents at
work, for example,'' said Mr John Davies, professor of psychology at
Strathclyde University.
Since 1987, the Government has chosen to place that point at 21 units a week
for men and 14 units for women. A unit equals approximately half a pint of
beer, a single measure of spirits, or a glass of wine.
Mr Davies believed any so-called ``safe'' limit was false ``because everyone
assumes that if you stay below it you are totally safe''.
Mr Douglas Allsop, of the Scottish Council on Alcohol, said there had always
been ``an amber area'' between the so-called ``safe'' drinking limit - 21 units
for men and 14 for women - and the Government's other limit, the so-called
``dangerous'' drinking limit of 50 units a week for men and 35 for women. The
council uses the traffic lights analogy with the 21 to 50 area for men and 14
to 35 zone for women, classed as amber or ``a sliding scale into danger''. The
new guidelines of 28 units for men and 21 for women simply make the amber area
a bit smaller.
In fact, yesterday's statement gives more recognition to the idea of a sliding
scale of harm than its predecessors. The maximum health advantage will come
from consuming one to two alcohol units a day. Three to four for a man, or two
to three for a woman, are not accompanied by big health risks.
The more units piled on on top of that, the more danger there is to your
health. Yesterday, groups like Alcohol Concern welcomed the care with which the
Depertment of Health and its advisors had weighed up the pros and cons on the
basis of scientific evidence but expressed doubts that new guidelines could be
reduced to a simple and effective health education message.

RELAXATION of the Government's recommended safe drinking limits was given a
mixed reception last night.
Mr Penny Richardson, director of the Edinburgh and Lothian Council on Alcohol,
said: ``We are slightly puzzled at the message being put out. There is this
relaxation on one hand but on the other the various royal medical colleges are
still advocating the lower limits.
``The move to a daily limit is helpful but we would like to see a matching
investment in health promotion and education, and funding for the councils on
alcohol.
``The central message should always be that whatever and whenever you take,
don't mix alcohol with other drugs, machinery, or when you are driving or
working.''
Actor and broadcaster Iain Agnew sees the issue from both sides. He appears as
a fearsome clan chief in one of the new television commercials aiming to win a
younger market for whisky, but also hears the darker side of drink when he has
to fend off the occasional late-night callers who have had one too many on his
Scot FM phone-in programme.
``I have always been of the opinion that a glass of red wine certainly does no
harm. It is so good for you'' he said. ``The same applies to whisky. But there
is nothing more boring than a drunk on air, thinking they are entertaining the
audience but they are not. I just try to make sure they don't get on air.''
Mr Ronald Gow, assistant director the CBI Scotland, said attitudes to alcohol
among companies had shifted considerably in recent years.
``I don't think anybody in industry is trying to change the social habits of a
country but there has been a move away from alcohol as part of a move towards
promoting good health. We encourage employers to take a holistic approach to
their employees' health. A healthy body and healthy mind means that people are
happy at their work and more productive,'' he said.
Mr Douglas Allsop, the director of the Scottish Council on Alcohol, welcomed
the new limits. ``Moving to daily limits is a substantial step forward. We are
still apt to regard Friday and Saturday nights as drinking nights in Scotland
when people go out and quaff their entire weekly ration,'' he said.
``Quite frankly, the old 21 and 14-unit limits were so low that not many people
paid much attention to them. Most people can see from life and observation that
a man who drinks two pints of beer a day is not doing any harm to himself at
all.
``Another major step forward is that the Government has now taken on board the
growing body of evidence that moderate drinking does carry some positive
benefits.''
Asked if he thought the new limits would be heeded, Mr Alsopp said: ``All you
can do is give people facts. It is a free country.''
Mr Robin Tucek, co-author of a new book on malt whisky, is less convinced. He
said: ``Any guidance from government departments should be treated with a large
pinch of salt. Most people drink sensibly and will not be changing their
lifestyle simply because someone says it is safe to take this amount or that
amount. The only government guidance that is worthwhile is not to drink and
drive.''

BBC Scotland's flagship news programme Reporting Scotland is changing its
starting time from next Monday to compete directly with rival news programmes
shown by Scottish and Grampian Television.
BBC Scotland chiefs conceded that their programme has been disadvantaged in the
past by going on air up to three minutes after Scottish Television's Scotland
Today and Grampian's North Tonight. Reporting Scotland is normally shown after
the national weather forecast broadcast at the end of the Six O' Clock News.
The programme attracts less than one-third of the potential viewing audience
while its main rival, Scottish Television, is understood to have just over 50%.
BBC Scotland's rescheduling will involve dispensing with the services of
weather people such as Ian McCaskill and Michael Fish in the early part of the
evening.
Instead Heather Reid will cover Scottish, national, and international weather,
in a slot lasting at least two-and-a-half minutes at the end of Reporting
Scotland.

<TEXT>
THE publication of the report, which highlights the significant health benefits
of moderate drinking in preventing some common but potentially lethal diseases,
was welcomed by some medical experts who confirmed that the Government claims
were backed by scientific research.
Yesterday, Mr John Duffy, senior lecturer in the University of Edinburgh's
department of psychiatry and a member of the renowned Edinburgh-based Alcohol
Research Group, said he had carried out a lengthy study into the protective
effects of alcohol, particulary on middle-aged men, and was pleased the
findings had been recognised by the Department of Health.
Mr Duffy said the effects of alcohol on health were far less controversial than
other assertions contained in the report and there was considerable evidence to
suggest moderate consumption of alcohol could prevent coronary heart disease,
ischaemic strokes, cholesterol gallstones, and certain prostate conditions in
men.
In the case of coronary heart disease, scientific studies carried out in
Britain and America had shown that alcohol appeared to prevent dangerous blood
clots by dilating blood vessels.
Mr Duffy also said that years of research into the health effects of alcohol
had cast doubt on the assertion that the recommended limit for men should be 21
units per week.
In a paper published in the International Journal of Epidemiology earlier this
year, Mr Duffy concluded: ``The misinterpretation of 21 units per week for men
as a safe limit, implying that any drinking above that level is hazardous, does
not seem justified.''
He added that all the indications were that the so-called accepted levels of
sensible alcohol consumption were not those which scientists would describe as
the maximum levels a person could safely consume.
In his paper, Mr Duffy also pointed to findings which suggested total
abstention from drink carried certain risks but said further research was
needed.
Mr Duffy also warned that, while there was reason to question the ``less is
best'' approach advocated by the World Health Organisation and the Scandinavian
countries and evidence that 21 units was not the most the average man could
safely drink, the setting of new ``safe'' recommended levels was to some extent
a spurious exercise since there was no definitive evidence over what levels
could prevent disease.

THE DRAWBACKS
STUPID, insensitive, and based on questionable scientific evidence. This was
the reaction yesterday of one consultant working in the accident and emergency
department of an average city hospital to the Government's new guidelines on
recommended maximum alcohol intake levels.
Pick any night of the week and the emergency rooms of the Victoria Infirmary in
the south of Glasgow sees a stream of up to 200 accident admissions.
Few eyebrows would be raised by those working in any other Scottish hospital to
learn that around half of the Victoria's casualties have come to grief through
drink. By the late evening, consultant Ian Anderson said you would be
hard-pressed to find a patient who was sober.
Mr Anderson painted a depressing picture of a department forced to deal with
the effects of Scotland's ``number one drug''. In a slightly resigned tone, he
told of the vomiting, abusive, violent patients who use vast amounts of
hospital time, staff patience, and much-needed beds.
Among each batch of daily admissions are those who have been involved in a
fight, those who have fallen over, and those who have simply poisoned
themselves with drink.
For accident and emergency staff, moping up can be an unrewarding, dangerous
job compounded by the problem of attempting to make an accurate diagnosis of
conditions often obscured by drunkenness.
``The real problem with drink is that it is a great mimicker of other
conditions,'' said Mr Anderson. ``The danger is smelling drink and dismissing
someone as merely a drunk when something else is wrong. Consequently, we have
to keep people in overnight while an assessment is made. A lot of beds in this
city are being used to watch people.''
Mr Anderson described the timing of the announcement, in the run-up to
Christmas and on the heels of the Government's straight to the point drink
drive campaign, as ``insensitive and remarkably stupid''.
He said: ``Frankly, people have a problem with this Government's credibility.
It seems like the Department of Health is deliberately looking for a banana
skin.''
Mr Anderson also questioned the raising of recommended limits by nearly 50%
when, he said, the original levels were fairly arbitrary. ``Does this mean they
got it wrong 10 years ago? I don't think there is a safe level since what is
okay for one individual is not for another.
``It's like saying there are safe levels of exercise or food. It's just a
figure plucked out of the air. I remain to be convinced by the safety claims.''

Ruth after meeting the princess briefly at a charity dinner. Of the princess's
frank Panorama interview about her marriage, Dr Ruth said: ``I would have liked
to talk to the two of them..... My office has two entrances. People can come to
me without being seen.''

<HEADLINE>Premier unbowed by unions' biggest show of strength yet in crippling 19-day dispute  Millions take to streets in France</HEADLINE>

STRIKING public service workers staged a massive show of strength across France
today, but embattled conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe said his bitterly
disputed welfare reforms would go ahead.
Trade unions said between 1.7 and two million protesters marched throughout
France to demand that Juppe abandon a plan for new taxes and health cost
controls to wipe out the debts of the social security system, which the
government says is vital to prepare France for European monetary union in 1999.
Railwaymen voted to continue a crippling 19-day stoppage for at least another
24 hours to demand more concessions despite Juppe's pledge to shelve a plan to
streamline the SNCF state railway and preserve a generous pension scheme for
rail workers.
The Communist-led CGT union called for another day of mass protest on Saturday
to demand that Juppe scrap his welfare reforms.
Unbowed by the most widespread labour unrest since the May 1968 student-worker
uprising, Juppe told Parliament that the social security reform would be
implemented by decree next month to save the welfare system from bankruptcy.
``This reform will come into effect, gradually and with consultation,'' he said
in a defiant response to a left-wing opposition no-confidence motion. ``There
is no serious alternative to the reform I proposed.''
Parliament easily rejected the motion, the second in a week. It was backed by
94 opposition MPs, far short of the minimum 287 needed to pass in the National
Assembly.
The motion cleared the way for Juppe to implement the core welfare reforms by
decree. He said the first two decrees creating a new tax to pay off the social
security fund's debts and reforming the organisation of health care were due to
take effect next month.
In the streets outside, demonstrators chanted ``Juppe resign'', ``Scrap the
Juppe plan'', and ``Juppe, make the bosses pay''.
Marc Blondel, leader of the independent Force Ouvriere, said: ``The balance of
power is on my side and on the side of all the unions, so this is going to
continue. With a demonstration this big, you can't imagine we're going to drop
our pants.''
Police said 100,000 people marched in the Mediterranean port of Marseilles,
where the demonstration was even bigger than during the May 1968 student-worker
uprising. Organisers estimated the crowd at up to 300,000.
Elsewhere, there were crowds of at least 50,000 in Bordeaux and Toulouse, piled
high with rubbish after dustmen joined the strike, and tens of thousands in
Rouen, Rennes, Caen, and Nice.
For the 19th day, there were no trains nationwide and public transport was at a
standstill in Paris and provincial towns. Giant traffic jams clogged all
approaches to the capital.
Strikers also blockaded the Channel Tunnel for 75min, preventing cars from
joining Le Shuttle service.
Hundreds of motorists were stuck in a tailback in Calais as around 1000
strikers blocked the toll-booths. However Le Shuttle freight services and
Eurostar foot-passenger trains were running normally, as were all France-bound
trains under the Channel.
There were no national newspapers and public radio stations broadcast a
curtailed service. Strikes by air controllers and airport firemen disrupted
flights. The government said one-third of the civil service was on strike,
including many teachers.
There were, however, signs of some divisions in union ranks with two smaller
groups, the Christian CFTC and the management CFE-CGC union, calling for a
return to work.
ZEEBRUGGE: The QE2 shunned strike-bound France today, taking passengers
expecting a shopping trip in Paris to Belgium. The cruiser had been due at the
French port of Le Havre and offer passengers a day in Paris, before going to
Amsterdam.-Reuter.

<TEXT>
A BID to reopen the notorious Hanger 13 rave venue will be made in the new year.
The boss of the seaside nightclub wants it to become a ``role model'' for safe
dancing.
Three youths died at the venue in Ayr last year after taking ecstasy at weekend
rave parties.
Mr Fraser McIntyre, manager of the club which was shut down by licensing bosses
last March, said: ``We will be applying to the council for the return of our
licence early next year. We want to get back into business as the premises are
providing no income at the moment.
``A lot of other activities such as discos, tea dances, and children's parties
were stopped when they took away our entertainments licence.
``We want to start again and don't see why we should not have weekend dances.
``But we have no intention of retaining the name Hanger 13, simply out of
respect for the boys who died and their families.''
Kyle and Carrick licensing board will consider an application to renew the
licence at its meeting in March.
Mr Fraser said: ``A lot of people support our view that closing clubs is not
the answer to the drugs problem.
``We worked very closely with the Drugs Forum at the Scottish Office to mould
new legislation for safer rave venues.
``We could become a role model in the running of such dances in the future.''
``Whether or not Hanger 13 exists, there will still be a drugs problem in the
country.''
In May last year John Nisbet, 18, of New Cumnock, and Andrew Dick, 19, of
Glasgow, died from taking ecstasy at the club. Three months later Andrew
Stoddart, 20, from Rigside, Lanarkshire, died in similar circumstances.

THE American Indians' belief that ``the environment is something that we have
borrowed from our children, not something we have inherited from our parents''
was held up as a definition of sustainable development by Scottish Environment
Minister Lord Lindsay yesterday.
However, speaking at the Scottish Environmental Forum's seminar in Glasgow, he
warned environmentalists that the practical application of this principle was
more complex. He said that since 178 countries signed Agenda 21, the programme
for local and national action on sustainable development, at the Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the UK had made impressive progress.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development last year had placed
the UK top or second in 10 of its 37 core indicators, he said.
Lord Lindsay praised efforts at grassroots level and by local authorities to
implement the objectives of Agenda 21.
``Without the voluntary contribution and initiatives by people closer to ground
level, the diktats and prescriptions from central Government have a fairly
limited shelf-life,'' he said.
He also announced that the principle aim of the new Scottish Environmental
Protection Agency, which will be launched in April, will be ``to deliver
well-managed integrated environmental protection, not only as an end in itself
but as a contribution to the Government's goal of sustainable development''.
The guidance is being put out for consultation.
The director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, Mr Kevin Dunion, who chaired the
seminar, called for a new mechanism to link local and national action.
``In particular, the home energy efficiency scheme (whose funding was cut in
the Budget), has now become a victim of its own success,'' he said.

Larnaca, Tuesday
A CYPRUS court today heard conflicting statements in which three British
soldiers blamed each other for the killing of a Danish woman tour guide.
Geoff Pernell, 23, Allan Ford, and Justin Fowler, both 27, have denied
abduction, conspiracy to rape, and the manslaughter of Louise Jensen, found
dead in a shallow grave near Ayia Napa on September 15, 1994.
The three, in statements read out by a police officer in the island's Assizes
court, gave conflicting accounts of how the 23-year-old tour guide was raped
and bludgeoned to death.
Ford admitted bludgeoning Jensen several times over the head and throat with an
army spade, but not killing her.
Pernell said Fowler had sex with Jensen and Ford battered her to death.
Fowler said Ford and then Pernell had sex with Jensen and then beat her to
death.
Cyprus police chief inspector Charalambos Argyrou read one statement by Ford,
three by Pernell, and one by Fowler to a hushed courtroom.
The defendants, based with the 1st Battalion, Royal Greenjackets at the British
base of Dhekelia in Cyprus, sat together in the dock, silent and expressionless.
Jensen's Cypriot boyfriend had testified that the three soldiers abducted her
after knocking the two of them off a motorcycle with their yellow ``mini moke''
recreational vehicle on the outskirts of the resort.
``I don't remember picking up the spade but I hit her on the head with the flat
side just hard enough to knock her unconscious. It didn't work.......I hit her
again the same as before and she slumped sideways,'' Ford, from Birmingham,
said in his statement.
``I know she wasn't dead because I could still hear her breathing. She looked
like she was asleep. Somebody grabbed the spade off me and pushed me away.
Stunned, I just stared at her face. Then the spade hit her, I think, neck and
again and again.''
Ford said he looked away from her but did not look at who was hitting her.
``I was frightened and sickened,'' said Pernell, who is from Oldbury, West
Midlands. ``When we stopped the car Justin asked the girl for sex. She didn't
refuse.......I saw them having sex.
``Allan was standing behind them. When Justin got up he hit her over the head a
number of times. She was not screaming.......it was as though she had trouble
breathing. There was also a bubbling noise present. Allan was hitting her on
the face, nose, and throat.''
Pernell said he was pacing up and down. ``I didn't think either one was capable
of this,'' he said.
Fowler, from Falmouth, blamed the other two for urging him to knock Jensen and
her boyfriend off their bike, because they ``wanted a woman''.
By the time they reached a dirt track, where Jensen was eventually found
buried, Jensen had soiled her jeans, he said. The other two men ripped off her
clothes and Ford told him to have intercourse with Jensen, he claimed.
``I pulled down my shorts and tried to do as I was told but the smell and
situation made it impossible,'' said Fowler.
He claimed he saw Ford try to have sex with Jensen and then Pernell swopped
places with him.
``Then I saw Geoff hit the woman with a spade. I couldn't believe it was
happening,'' Fowler said. The trial continues.-Reuter.

Test purchases are an effective and proven deterrent. I cannot understand why
Home Office Ministers are dragging their feet.             Nigel Griffiths
CHILDREN should be allowed to pose as customers to trap off-licences selling
alcohol to under-age buyers, Labour said yesterday.
The call came as a leading children's doctor said three out of four emergencies
she had encountered at one stage involved drunk adolescents.
Shadow consumer affairs spokesman Nigel Griffiths called for a change in the
law which would allow trading standards officers and the police to work with
children to make ``test'' purchases of alcohol.
The law currently allows children, under supervision, to buy cigarettes, adult
videos, and fireworks, and test purchases have resulted in successful
prosecutions.
Mr Griffiths said such purchases were allowed because, while it was illegal to
sell fireworks, adult videos, and cigarettes to children, it was not illegal
for children to buy them.
However, it was illegal for children to buy alcohol so test purchases could not
be made since the children would also be guilty. Mr Griffiths said he wanted
the 1988 Licensing Act to be amended.
``The public are alarmed at the increase in teenage drunkenness and by the ease
with which under-age children can buy alcohol,'' he said. ``Test purchases are
an effective and proven deterrent. I cannot understand why Home Office
Ministers are dragging their feet.''
Dr Joan Robson, leading consultant in paediatric accident and emergency
medicine at Liverpool's Alder Hey Hospital, said: ``Every Friday and Saturday
evening we see adolescents who are unconscious due to alcohol. At one stage,
three out of four emergencies we were dealing with were drunken children. I
welcome this initiative to reduce the problem.''
Mr Peter Maudsley, director of Liverpool Council's consumer protection
committee, also gave his support to Labour's proposal to give trading standards
officers more powers to prosecute off-licences which break the law.
``The carefully organised and supervised practice of working with children is
endorsed by the High Court and in Home Office guidelines of good practice.
Sadly, the Home Office refuses to amend the law similarly to permit test
purchases for alcohol.''
He said supervised purchases of fireworks and adult videos had seen their
illegal sale to under-age children drop from 50% to 5%.
Professor Philip Graham, who chaired the Royal College of Physicians and
British Paediatric Association working party on alcohol and the young, said:
``The supervised purchase of cigarettes to catch illegal sellers to children,
with their parents' consent, has been effective. There is no reason why this
should not be extended to alcohol purchases.''
Professor Graham said: ``The figures we produced in our report were that one in
four 14-year-olds had found it possible to buy alcohol in a pub, and two in
five of 16-year-olds had.
``This suggests there are hundreds of thousands of 15, 16, and 17-year-olds not
finding it difficult to buy alcohol in pubs, so it is clear the law is being
flouted very considerably.''
An official survey had found 28% of 13-year-old boys and 15% of 13-year-old
girls had been drunk at least once in the previous year, and over half of
15-year-old boys and just under half 15-year-old girls.

<HEADLINE>Five life terms for attacker Appeal to victims of serial rapist</HEADLINE>

POLICE have appealed for victims of a serial rapist to come forward after the
attacker yesterday began five life sentences.
Victor Willoughby, 30, is suspected of more than 100 sex attacks.
Detective Superintendent Duncan MacRae described him as ``the most dangerous
and prolific serial sex offender I have ever come across''.
The officer continued: ``We are dealing with the tip of the iceberg. We have
already investigated 17 rapes and I wouldn't be surprised if the total went
into three figures.
``We believe out there among the public are more of his victims and we clearly
would like to hear from them.''
His appeal was echoed by two of Willoughby's eight victims who were in court to
see their attacker convicted and sentenced.
Police have set up a special help line for other victims to report their
ordeal. It will be manned by female officers familiar with the case. The number
is 0181 733 3842.
The judge said the attacks, spanning a year, ``were all of the most appalling
sexual ferocity''.
At the Old Bailey, Judge Neil Denison said: ``The protection of the community
and particularly of women requires that I pass an indeterminate sentence. You
have a previous conviction very similar to these attacks.''
Willoughby started his reign of terror in north-west London shortly after he
was released from jail for a previous assault.
He terrorised women walking home alone late at night and stalked night buses
and scoured streets in his search for victims, the court had heard.
He was convicted of four rapes, another serious sexual offence, three indecent
assaults, false imprisonment, robbery, attempted robbery and dangerous driving.
The defendant from Tottenham, north London, had denied all charges.
In 1987, he was sentenced to eight years for dishonesty and attempting to rape
a woman walking home from a night bus.
On his release in 1992, he wounded a man in a street attack and was sent back
to prison for 12 months. Released in August 1993, he began stalking and
attacking his current victims within weeks.
The women, aged between 16 and 47, were subjected to degrading sexual assaults.
All the women were on their way home after a night out.
In one attack he pretended he was a minicab driver and then raped the woman in
the car.
In some attacks he hid behind bushes or in the shadows and pounced on his
victims from behind, dragging them into alleyways and, on one occasion, into a
churchyard.
He threatened violence and ``each woman was so frightened they offered
relatively no resistance,'' said Mr Nigel Sweeney, prosecuting. Only one woman
managed to fight him off.
Two of his victims remembered a distinct smell during their ordeal. One noticed
a pink oil moisturising gel in his hair. Another registered `` a sickly sweet
smell about her attacker''.
When arrested, Willoughby had the same sort of gel in his hair.
Mr Sweeney said there had also been a DNA match.
The two victims in court urged others attacked to come forward.
``It is a difficult thing to do, but we have received sensitive treatment from
the police and the court. I was so angry and I was determined to go through the
case,'' said 22-year-old student, Miss X.

<TEXT>
Arusha, Tanzania, Monday
THE UN tribunal investigating Rwanda's genocide issued its first indictments
today, accusing eight people of taking part in the mass slaughter of thousands
in a football stadium and church.
Tribunal chairman Judge Richard Goldstone refused to name the accused in case
four still at liberty escaped arrest. Four were in custody in Zambia, he said.
Goldstone, a South African judge, said the eight were charged with carrying out
genocide and three counts of crimes against humanity in the western Rwandan
town of Kibuye last year.
Rwanda's genocide, one of the most intense bouts of killing in history, lasted
from April to June last year, as mobs of the Hutu majority led by soldiers and
militia systematically put to death up to one million minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus.
Governments concerned are obliged by the United Nations to hand over suspects
to the UN-appointed tribunal, but Goldstone admitted the difficulties in
bringing suspects to justice.
``The indictments mark the beginning of a long and difficult road.......many
challenges lie ahead,'' he said.
He expected trials to start within six to eight weeks and the tribunal to begin
excavating mass graves next month.
In the Rwandan capital Kigali, some officials reacted with dismay.
``For a genocide of one million people, only eight indicted? This isn't enough.
The tribunal could have done more,'' said Information Minister Jean-Pierre
Bizimana.
Goldstone's decision not to name the accused came under fire from
prosecutor-general Simeon Rwagasore.
``Our people would like to know immediately which criminals are on the list.
Everyone has been waiting for this. We have a right to know,'' he said.
Rwagasore warned that further delays would prompt genocide survivors to take
justice into their own hands.
Rwanda's own justice system has been paralysed. Jails are crammed with 60,000
people not tried under genocide charges. The prison population is growing by
1000 a week.
``If criminals remain free, this will only strengthen our culture of impunity.
Our people have already begun taking justice in their hands. Acts of revenge
will only increase. Repatriation of refugees will be paralysed,'' he said.
In another development today, Rwanda and the Security Council agreed in
principle on keeping 1200 UN troops and 200 military observers in the central
African country.
However a resolution on the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (Unamir), whose
mandate expired on Friday but was extended until today, was still being
negotiated as envoys argued about whether troops should protect aid
workers.-Reuter.

Rome, Tuesday
WITHIN 50 years, skiers could find no snow on their favourite Alpine slopes and
and sunbathers scant sand on Mediterranean shores, the World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF) warned today.
The environmental group outlined the stark scenario as scientists from the
UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change met in Rome to approve
new research that suggests the earth's average temperature could rise by 2C
next century.
The WWF said half of the world's glaciers and 85% of deltas could disappear
within 100 years as the greenhouse effect caused lower snowfalls, more rain,
and hotter summers.
Scientists believe the phenomenon is largely caused by burning fossil fuels
which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat
in the atmosphere.
``The Alps are experiencing one of the fastest changes,'' said Paolo Lombardi,
International Programme Officer at the WWF in Italy.
In parts of the Swiss Alps, the snowline has risen 110yd since 1980. Martin
Beniston, who helped co-ordinate an IPCC study into the effect of global
warming on mountains, said that would worsen.
``The expected rise in the snowline in winter is 100 metres for every degree
increase in temperature,'' he said.
That would put famous Alpine ski resorts such as Courcheval and Val d'Isere at
risk, Lombardi said.
He said 20in of snow for 100 days a year constituted good skiing conditions,
and those were usually found at 1333yd altitude.
``There could be a shift in 30-50 years to more than 1666yd,'' he said.
``That's bad. Three hundred metres (333yd) may seem like a little, but it's
not.''
Beniston said the Rockies in the United States could also suffer and the WWF
forecast the US ski industry could lose up to $1.7bn a year (#1001m) because of
climate change. It said Australia's ski business could dry up altogether.
Lombardi said global warming also consituted a big threat to the Mediterranean,
whose coastlines are at risk of rapid erosion in the next century.
``The Mediterranean is considered one of the areas in the world most threatened
by climate change,'' he said. ``One-third of beaches are already retreating.''
He said sea levels rose by 1.2in to 1.6in last century but could rise an
average 20in by the second half of the 21st century.
Rising water levels are a particular threat to areas where subsidence is
already a big problem. ``The Venice lagoon will disappear unless dikes are
built,'' he said.
The IPCC, an independent body set up in 1988 by the United Nations and the
World Meteorological Organisation, is meeting to approve new guidelines on
climate change.
Some 300 delegates from 120 countries approved three key studies stating there
was a ``discernible human impact'' on world weather.
They were still haggling over another text designed to help governments turn
scientific information into action when signatories of the UN's 1991 Framework
Convention on climate meet in March.
The convention, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio, called on countries to
stabilise emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by 2000.-Reuter.

A REPORTER and photographer working for the Sun accused of a breach of the
peace walked free from court yesterday after the case was found not proven.
At Dundee Sheriff Court, Mrs Doris Brannan, 50, claimed she was ``hysterical''
when reporter David Dinsmore and freelance photographer Alan Ewing came to her
door.
However, the two men said they had been assaulted by her son.
The court heard they wanted to interview the widow of murder victim Danny
Hallet, a Dundee publican.
They believed Mrs Dale Hallet was at a flat in Murrayfield Terrace, Dundee, but
found it occupied by Mrs Doris Brannan, who refused to give them Mrs Hallet's
address.
Mrs Brannan said: ``I shouted at them to go away. I got hysterical and my son
evicted them.''
Her son, Peter Lea, 26, said he grabbed the reporter by the arm and ``threw him
out the house''.
However, Mr Ewing, 38, of Dungoil Road, Lenzie, said a man ``came at him'' from
inside the house. He added: ``I put my hand up and he caught me on the side of
the head.''
Mr Dinsmore, 27, of Lancaster Crescent, Kelvindale, Glasgow, said Mr Lea spat
on his coat as he and Mr Ewing went down the stairs.

Washington, Tuesday
THE new Israeli Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, has launched a new effort to make
peace with Syria, using a visit to Washington as his platform.
He addressed a joint session of Congress today, and took the occasion to call
on President Assad to make the last, final effort to reach an agreement.
Mr Peres came to the United States to attend a memorial service for Yitzhak
Rabin in New York on Sunday and to pay his first formal visit to Washington as
premier. The joint session, which tied up members of Congress for most of the
morning when they might have been debating Bosnia or working on the budget
crisis, was a gesture of respect to the late prime minister as much as a
welcome to his successor.
The Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, will return to the Middle East
later this week, after the Dayton agreement is signed in Paris on Thursday, to
try to make some progress on the peace negotiations. They have been stalled
since last summer on the issue of military patrols on the Golan Heights, and on
the question of the amount of Syrian territory that Israel will return.
The Syrians want the whole of the Golan, just as Anwar Sadat insisted on the
whole of Sinai when he made peace with Israel in 1979. The Israelis have
demanded that there should be independent monitors to watch for the movement of
troops in the liberated territory.
There has been a small international force in Sinai, including some Americans,
since the Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement, ensuring that Egypt does not move
troops into the demilitarised areas. Israel wants the same facilities on the
Golan, and has offered to allow Syrians to monitor Israeli troop movements
along the shores of the Sea of Galilee.
So far, Mr Assad has refused to move. However, he called President Clinton
yesterday while Mr Peres was in the White House, to agree to Mr Christopher's
mission and the president said later that he hoped that this was a sign of
progress.
In his address to Congress, Mr Peres said: ``I would like to use this podium to
turn to President Assad of Syria and say to him: `Without forgetting the past,
let us not look back. Let fingertips touch a new hope. Let each party yield to
the other, each giving consideration to the respective needs of the other'.''
He also noted: ``Nothing convinced Israelis of the sincerity of the Arabs more
than the sympathy and condolences they expressed when they heard of the
assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.'' He suggested that Israel's loss, in turn,
should convince the Arabs of the sincerity of its desire for peace.

CLYDEBANK and Airdrie will try for a third time later this month after their
clash last night was knocked out by fog 45 minutes before the kick-off. The
clubs hastily contacted Scottish League secretary Peter Donald to get
permission for the game to go ahead on Saturday, December 23.
Bankies secretary Ian Steedman said: ``The league rules suggest it should be
played next midweek. But it is better to play on a Saturday. We contacted the
league secretary and he has given the go-ahead.''
q.DUNFERMLINE striker Andy Smith, who broke a leg in a pre-season game against
Bolton only weeks after his move from Airdrie, has come through three reserve
games without reaction.
q.DAVE Bassett yesterday quit as manager of first division Sheffield United.
His departure, understood to be ``by mutual consent,'' ends an eight-year stay
with United, who only last week came under the control of new chairman Mike
McDonald.
q.WALSALL moved into the FA Cup third round after scoring five extra-time goals
in an incredible 8-4 home win over Torquay, the side propping up the third
division.
The teams finished level at 3-3 in normal time. Walsall, lucky to survive when
an Ian Hathaway shot hit both posts in the final minute, went clear with goals
from Chris Marsh, Kyle Lightbourne, and Martin O'Connor in the first seven
minutes of extra time.

VIEWS of Arran, a private road to the beach, and an award-winning
bed-and-breakfast business - Spottiswoode is a vibrant reminder of the
traditional Clyde coast lifestyle.
The late Victorian villa stands in Seamill, right next to the Hydro, and was
built in 1895 on a private road which leads straight to the sandy beach (with
no roads for children to cross).
The ground-floor accommodation consists of an entrance hall, sitting room,
dining room, kitchen and family room, utility room, and shower room on the
ground floor. On the first floor there are four bedrooms, en-suite bathroom,
and two family bathrooms. Then there are a further two bedrooms, study and
bathroom on the second floor.
The house has been well maintained and considerable effort has been made to
retain its character and charm. Although the purchaser could use it as a
substantial family home, Spottiswoode also offers considerable potential for
running a small bed-and-breakfast business. It is currently one of the few
establishments in Ayrshire to hold the Scottish Tourist Board's Delux Award.
To the front is a Victorian-style 100ft-long walled garden which creates
privacy and seclusion. The rear garden has an old-fashioned drying green with
vegetable, flower and herb beds. Gates divide the front and rear gardens and
there is a single garage.
The Largs-based estate agency Welch &amp; Roe is marketing Spottiswoode at a fixed
price of #157,000.

IF the bookmakers and pundits have got it right, Anfield, which has housed many
a historical football evening, will be the setting tonight for an Irish wake, a
celebration of a memorable era that has come to an end.
The problem with such theorising is that it concerns a man, Jack Charlton, and
a team, the Republic of Ireland, who have spent the last nine years defying
odds, experts, and logic. When dealing with that kind of defiance, it is best
not to bank on winning the wherewithal for the family Christmas by betting
against them.
Rationale says that Holland, a team of all the Ajax talents, should beat them
comfortably enough in the play-off to decide the last place in next summer's
European Championship finals in England.
Indeed, people are already suggesting that the Dutch are good bets to win the
tournament itself, but there has ever been an inherent flaw in the Holland
players' make-up which forces any analyst to ca' canny.
In fact, it is this self-destructive trait which has brought about their role
in this play-off in the first place.
The squad was not enamoured when Guus Hiddink took over as manager from Dick
Advocaat at the start of the year, so much so that the Ajax contingent
boycotted a friendly because they were too busy at club level.
Ultimately, they lost to Belarus, of all countries, and only retrieved the
play-off position by beating Norway.
All appears to be well with the players now, but you never can be sure. They
certainly know each other well enough. It is expected that the team will
consist of eight Ajax players and three former Ajax men, an incredible tribute
to the world and European club champions from Amsterdam.
A sign of the changing times in that cosmopolitan city is that six of the
players are black but, more important, all 11 are products of the Ajax school
of excellence which is unquestionably the leader in its field.
Charlton, typically, throws cold water on the Ajax theory, pointing out that no
country has ever successfully transferred a club team to international level.
The Dutch club might well be the exception to that rule, if the standards they
have set are maintained.
Charlton has said he will not decide his own future immediately after the game,
preferring to take a little time to discuss matters with the Irish FA.
However, if his team does lose, it will surely be finale time after glorious
defiance in World Cups and European Championships which took his adopted
country to a place among the elite of football nations.
Although that was done by dispensing with the frills and taking the direct
route to goal, a tactic which flummoxed the dedicated strategists, there was a
great deal more to his team than the long-ball punt.
He has hidden his men away in the Borders this week as he wrestled with his
selection, following the injury in training suffered by Steve Staunton. He will
field four full backs, two of them as midfield defenders, to combat the threat
of Dutch wingers Marc Overmars and Glenn Helder. That means a recall for
Chelsea's new signing, Terry Phelan.
The presence of Marseille's former Celtic man Tony Cascarino - who is nothing
else if not a survivor - will ensure the normal ``garryowen'' ball into the
middle to annoy the more cultured Dutch defence, but the return of John
Sheridan, a player of redoubtable passing skills, is an indication that other
options are available.
Overall, the brilliance of players like Denis Bergkamp, Clarence Seedorf, and
Patrick Kluivert, to name but three, should see Holland through but, in the
jargon of the modern game, they will have to be up for it, or Big Jack's
roadshow might still have another tour to do.

WALES
WELSH manager Bobby Gould rubbed his hands together and smiled broadly at the
prospect of locking horns with Holland and Belgium in Group 7.
With minnows San Marino and Euro '96 finalists Turkey also in their five-strong
group, Gould said: ``It's such a great, great opportunity. Not only are the
games against Holland and Belgium ones we can look forward to financially, but
they're also games we really believe we can win.''
The Belgians are far from unfamiliar opponents, with meetings in the qualifying
tournaments for the 1992 European Championships, in which Wales picked up three
points out of four, and the 1994 World Cup, when each side won their home game
2-0.
But Wales have lost all three of their previous games against the Dutch.

OUR OPPONENTS:
SCOTLAND can count themselves lucky with last night's draw in Paris for World
Cup '98. Sweden, the No.1 seeds in Group 4, and Austria, the main threats to
Scotland's qualifying hopes, are teams past their prime.
The Swedes, who have been encountered in three previous World Cup campaigns,
have yet to record a single victory over the Scots. Their prospects of doing so
in the qualifying process will lie with a diminishing group of star players
past their sell-by date.
Only Thomas Brolin, sold by Parma to Leeds United last month after serious
injury problems, can hold genuine claims to world-class status.
Others, such as eccentric keeper Thomas Ravelli, Kennet Andersson, Klas
Ingesson and Stefan Schwartz, who made no significant impact in his time with
Arsenal, can no longer be regarded among the leading exponents of their
profession.
Austria are currently in a period of steep decline. Their domestic leagues are
blighted by falling attendances, bankruptcy,  and a lack of emerging talent.
Over the years the Bundesliga has proved to be a natural progression for their
best players, yet this season only two are to be found plying their trade there.
One is captain Andreas Herzog, a formidable attacking midfielder with Bayern
Munich, but he, too, has been hampered by injuries. The other is FC Cologne
striker Toni Polster, now 31, and no longer such a prolific scorer.
Latvia, Belarus, and Estonia have employed Russian coaches to assist their
development, but without the infrastructure and finance, their progress has
been restricted, even though there is undoubted talent. Aberdeen found that out
last season, when they were beaten in the UEFA Cup by Skonto Riga, of Latvia.
However, none of the representatives from these three nations made any
appreciable headway this season in the European club competitions.

NORTHERN IRELAND
MANAGER Bryan Hamilton reacted with a smile and a joke after hearing that his
country had been paired alongside Germany and Portugal in the qualifying draw.
Hamilton's homework began immediately, as he was summarising for BBC Radio 5
Live on Portugal's match against England at Wembley. The six-country group is
completed by Armenia, Albania, and the Ukraine.
``I have a choice,'' he said. ``I either throw myself off the twin towers or I
plan for the play-offs - I think I will plan for the play-offs. To be honest,
Portugal are a side who always put you under a lot of pressure. Germany will be
tough, but it is a great tie as well.
``However, I'm more worried about Armenia, Albania, and the Ukraine. At least I
know something about the other two.''

CONNOISSEURS of the hallway should have a look at The Beeches, a substantial
house in Cambuslang's conservation area.
The former manse has been converted into two dwellings and the whole of the
ground floor is now for sale. The house was built around 1870, converted in
1961, and retains many of its original features - of which the strongest is
probably the hall, a baronial-style space which also serves as a dining area.
Thus retaining an echo of ancient feasts in ancient halls, it has mahogany wood
panelling to three-quarter height and two full-height stained and leaded glass
windows, with their shutters in working order.
Two wooden doors have leaded glass insets and there is parquet flooring at the
reception area, original ceiling coving and ornate centre ceiling cornicing. A
pair of Victorian brass wall-mounted candleholders completes the period feel of
the hall.
The accommodation extends to about 2000sq.ft and comprises: the hall/dining
room; breakfasting kitchen; utility room; three bedrooms (main bedroom with
en-suite); family bathroom and separate toilet. The house has a large private
garden which offers the possibility of future development potential.

the UK could be boosted if this group were to be provided with new inducements
to buy homes.
The bad news is that there will be a decline in the number of people in the
first-time buyer age group over the next ten years. But the escalator need not
stall, says the CML research. The report reveals that home ownership levels
among the 30-44 age band are lower than those in the 45-64 age group. A dip in
home-ownership could be created as these lower rates feed through to the
succeeding age band during the next ten years - unless action is taken too
stimulate ownership among the current 30-.to 44-year-olds.
``This report shows that there is still significant scope for more people in
the UK to get the chance to own their own homes - particularly if conditions
which support owner-occupation are favourable,'' says Adrian Coles, CML
director-general. ``Affordability is currently excellent, but longer-term
changes in the types of households identified by this report should also be
taken into account when considering the future of home-ownership.''
Meanwhile, the lenders have also been looking at how the property crash has
affected the attitudes of buyers. Falls in house prices and the resulting
negative equity south of the Border have changed beliefs and behaviour in
relation to home-ownership.
Major influences on borrowing are: the advent of a low inflation economy;
greater insecurity in the labour market; and the ``overhang'' of high levels of
personal financial commitments from the late 1980s. Mortgage affordability also
plays a part.
The lack of the ``feelgood factor'' is at the heart of the changing beliefs
about borrowing. There has been some limited recovery in overall consumer
confidence since 1992.
The report also points out that a willingness to borrow and a willingness to
buy a home are separate, although related, processes. The first requires a
resurgence of consumers' confidence in their financial prospects. The second
also requires some certainty that house purchase will not be a disinvestment --
that house prices will not decline further and may indeed rise.
Only when consumer confidence about both financial prospects and house prices
coincide is mortgage borrowing likely to increase. Even when this happens, the
report concludes, house purchases and mortgage lending are likely to lag behind
any sustained recovery in consumer confidence.
``Overall attitudes to home-ownership have remained stable, and show a gradual
increase in the numbers of people expressing a preference for owning rather
than renting a home,'' says Peter Williams, CML head of research and external
affairs.
THE big mortgage lenders have been anxiously studying where their future market
will come from. Having seen the mortgage market flat on its back for the last
five years, the banks and building societies have launched a major examination
into future home-ownership trends.
And the news is good. Home-ownership is set to rise over the next ten years,
according to research for the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) which says that
the UK's 67% owner-occupation rate is likely to reach 70% to 75% by 2006.
Scotland's lower rate of home-ownership than the UK average means that there is
scope for even more rapid growth. At the moment less than 60% of Scottish
households are in owner-occupation.
Home-ownership in the UK: the Potential for Growth was written by researchers
from the University of Bristol and South Bank University for the CML. It
reviews the past growth of home-ownership since 1973 - including the huge
impact of council house sales - and looks at how changes in the make-up of the
population are likely to affect future trends in owner-occupation.
Much of the growth will come from changes in lifestyle. Although the population
is not increasing, Government estimates suggest that there will be a 12% growth
in the overall number of households over the next ten years - generating a
higher demand for owner- occupation.
It is estimated that, by the early years of the next century, there will be a
decline of 3.5% in the number of married households; an increase of 2% in the
number of lone parent households; and a 17% increase in single-person
households.
Single-person households have tradition-ally had low rates of home-ownership.

EVEN the fog lifted enough to let the 37,300 see the man of the night, Paul
McStay, celebrating almost 15 years as a signed Parkhead player doing what he
does best, playing in the green-and-white hoops.
From the moment he came on the pitch with his two little daughters in his arms
until he was cheered to the night sky at the end, the fans made this his own
special occasion.
The presence of Manchester United guaranteed such a crowd and a bumper pay-out
for McStay, who would collect something close to #400,000 from the testimonial
fund after the takings had been counted.
United manager Alex Ferguson would not grudge him a penny as one of his
staunchest admirers. Ferguson had hoped to field more of his star turns but
injury prevented him from doing so. The team he fielded made a decent game of
it, however, but they came up against Pierre van Hooydonk in lethal form.
The Dutch striker shot home the first goal early in the first half and after
United equalised through Paul Scholes before half-time, he produced a stunning
second score midway through the second period.
Substitute Chris Hay added a third before the end and the cheering went on . .
. and on.
McStay went to the centre circle, picked up the trophy presented by his
parents, then the main man took the mike and thanked the troops. The cheers
went on . . . but we have been through that.
Afterwards, the tributes flowed.
From Ferguson: ``It was a fabulous night. The number of people who showed up
proved what he means to them. He's been a marvellous player for Celtic, and
he's also a smashing lad. To have achieved what he has and retained humility
makes him special.''
From Tommy Burns: ``The supporters demonstrated how much they love him as a
player and how much they appreciate the fact that he stayed here.''
From Brian McClair: ``He is a rare talent and a great ambassador for the game.
He would compare with any midfield player I have seen or played with.''
From McStay, who threw his shirt into what used to be the jungle: ``It was a
bit different from the last time I did that. This time it was in pure
happiness. I didn't get a lot of sleep last night and it turned out to be a
very emotional game for me. I want to thank the fans not just for tonight but
for my whole career.''
As the crowd gathered earlier in the evening when the fog was at its worst, the
lights of Celtic's proud new stand loomed through the mist like a grounded
cruise liner, but the lines of the makeshift stand behind the goal, used for
the first time, could at least be spotted, and the pre-match fun, with
Coronation Street stars among the celebrity side, was discernible enough to
keep the crowd entertained.
The Old Crock Celtic side, possibly relieved that their former talents were not
over-scrutinised in the dim outlook, did have enough going for them to beat the
soap stars.
The mist, presumably under orders from the committee, eased just before
kick-off as the teams came out, each player with a young mascot.
They lined up in the middle of the park and awaited the arrival of the man
himself, who came on carrying his daughters, Melissa and Siobhan, to a
deafening reception.
Manchester, in one of their multitude of change strips, this version in grey,
were missing many of their stars of course, but this did not stop their fans
giving vein to the ``Ooh, aah, Cantona'' chant but maybe they were surprised to
hear the home troops joining in with gusto.
It made us wonder what reception the controversial Gallic stylist would have
received had he been fit to play.
The Celtic fans had another name to chant after 13 minutes when van Hooydonk
stepped in with one of the goals that are becoming a welcome habit at Parkhead.
It was the consequence of a sweet move, too, with Simon Donnelly holding the
ball intelligently before laying it across to Andy Walker, who promptly pushed
it to the far post where the Dutchman had no problems in sending it past Keith
Pilkington.
United equalised eight minutes later when a Lee Sharpe corner was touched on by
Steve Bruce and Scholes shot through a ruck of players into the net.
Celtic left Donnelly and O'Donnell inside at half-time, replacing them with Hay
and Brian McLaughlin as the grey mists came swirling over the field again.
Then United put on their first sub, Appleton for O'Kane, followed by Morten
Wieghorst coming on for Celtic in place of Collins.
The game had begun to lose momentum but van Hooydonk was merely biding his
time. In 66 minutes, the Dutchman struck with a tremendous goal, taking a pass
from Tosh McKinlay and thumping it low into the net from 25 yards.
Almost immediately, Celtic took off McKinlay and brought on Stuart Gray and, as
the fog closed in, United brought on Tomlinson for Cole.
Hay completed the scoring four minutes from time.
All that was left now was the final celebrations. The fog gave it all an unreal
feeling but McStay will remember it clearly enough.
CELTIC - Kerr, Vata, McKinlay, McNamara, Mackay, O'Donnell, Donnelly, McStay,
van Hooydonk, Walker, Collins. Substitutes - Wieghorst, Marshall, McLaughlin,
Gray, Hay.
MANCHESTER UNITED - Pilkington, Parker, O'Kane, Bruce, Neville, May, Davies,

KEEP your eye on Paisley used to be the old-time political motto. So how does
it translate today in terms of the housing market, for example? ``Very well
indeed,'' says Janette Turner, director of Paisley Property Letting Centre.
``It's too soon to see whether the Budget had any real effect on the market,
but Paisley is a very popular place for lets.
``In fact, we can say the whole of Renfrewshire is popular. It can get quieter
over Christmas and New Year, but we just can't get enough properties at most
times to meet demand.''
Being close to ``big brother'' Glasgow does not inhibit local enthusiasm.
Increased levels of activity have been noticeable from three specific areas -
the international airport, the local infirmary, and the university.
``This is an expanding area, and a busy one,'' says Janette. ``There are lots
of people in transit, as it were. Staff come for a relatively short-term
period. They don't want to be tied down, buying a property. They need a good
home base, and they want it at a good price.
``Young people don't choose to stay at home with their parents, either.
Everybody wants independence, but not to be tied down too soon to a mortgage.
We are solely into letting. We don't take on multi-occupation properties, but
there is a steady demand to meet for everything else, from small flats to
villas.
``We have just moved to new premises ourselves, on the main street. That has
given us a much higher profile. Business has improved - it just seems to have
taken off. And we can offer better prices than you get in Glasgow. That always
helps business.''
There is a similar story of steady business from Cluttons, at its Houston
office. People are moving into the area wanting to rent rather than buy. The
airport, infirmary, and university sectors provide a large degree of interest.
For a comparison of prices, Janette Turner indicates the possibilities in a
detached three-bedroom villa at Johnstone, coming on the market early in the
New Year. Fully furnished, with gas central heating, double glazing, a pleasant
garden and parking space, it will come in at around #500 a month.
A more modest place, say a fully-furnished studio flat in Paisley, comes in at
about #210, meeting many budgets.
Going for a one-bedroom fully furnished flat in the town, with shower room,
electric heating, and double glazing could increase the price to #280 a month.
Even moving out to Lochwinnoch need not be too expensive. A two-bedroom flat,
fully furnished, with electric heating - and convenient for Castle Semple Loch
, of course - is on the books for #350 a month.

Stenhousemuir 2, Arbroath 2
ARBROATH manager John Brogan was less than happy with referee Bobby Tait when
the whistler refused claims for a penalty in the dying seconds after striker
Steve McCormick - a former Stenhousemuir player - had been pulled down in the
box.
``Steve's jersey was pulled,'' said Brogan. ``I really thought it was a
penalty.''
But he was well pleased with his side's display. ``They (Stenhousemuir) are
League Challenge Cup holders and a division above us, but I thought we competed
well and, as I say, might have sneaked it if the penalty had been given.''
Ochilview counterpart Terry Christie was unhappy with his side's performance.
``We did not keep our shape at the back and lost silly goals as a
consequence,'' he said.
George McGeachie fired home to put the Warriors ahead with just a minute
gone, but McCormick shot home the leveller after 10     minutes.
Two bizarre own goals accounted for the final result. A Lee Gardner cross hit
'Muir midfielder Jimmy Fisher to fly into the net in 33 minutes. But two
minutes from the break, the pair accidentally combined again to enable the
Warriors to level, Gardner this time knocking a Fisher back-heeler past his own
keeper from close range.

n.SOD the season of goodwill (suggests STEWART McINTOSH). Christmas brings a
shining opportunity to check out the neuroses of your neighbours. Have you ever
considered that those ostentatious fairy lights next-door might be a cry for
help or a flashy appeal for friendship?
Psychologists in the USA - well, where else would they come from? - say that
people who put that extra bit of sparkle on to their Christmas trees are either
very friendly and sociable...... or are lonely and trying to make new friends.
Perhaps in a bid to make new friends in the psychological world, Wimpey Homes
has carried out its own research into those blinking lights. It reveals that
the amount of decoration which adorns a neighbourhood for Halloween or
Christmas can affect perceptions about the area.
The sight of Christmas decorations on the outside of homes - even just a simple
wreath - persuades passers-by that the neighbourhood is open and sociable. Some
householders admitted to Wimpey's researchers that they decorate their homes in
an attempt to try to get to know people in the area.
(This can lead to disappointment. Catching sight of your neighbours as they
shin back over the garden fence with your fairy lights in a swag bag might not
be the social contact that was anticipated.)
Other studies have shown that houses with doors accessible from the street are
felt to contain people who are friendly and approachable. Other features which
give visitors the impression that they will get a friendly greeting on your
doorstep include: front walls painted in vivid (but not flashy) colours;
curtains which can be clearly seen from the road; and a garden which does not
obscure the house. So, if the house next door is lit up brighter than George
Square and its garden is teeming with plastic Rudolphs and inflatable snowmen,
don't just scream for the style police. After all, it could be a cry for help.
You could reply by sharing some goodwill and inviting him or her in for a mince
pie.
Or you could buy yourself a couple of pit bull terriers for Christmas.

REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
JACK Charlton greeted news of the draw with optimism - even though his team
have to play in one of the six-nation groups.
He said: ``Romania are the only team there that you would say had excellent
quality. Even so, I believe that many of their top players are coming towards
the end of their careers.
``We remember them from the penalty shoot-out in the World Cup finals in Italy,
and they also did well in America, of course.
``To me, it looks like them or us to win the group because there are no other
teams we know we can't beat. It will be a case of not making a slip against the
smaller sides. In a group of equal standings you can often recover from the odd
mistake but it is unlikely in this one.''

ENGLAND
TERRY Venables will face a huge job to take England to the 1998 World Cup
finals.
Losing finalists Italy, the side that ended Ron Greenwood's bid to reach
Argentina in 1978, and old enemy Poland are bad enough, but the draw also threw
in the dangerous former Russian satellites of Georgia and Moldova.
``The prospect of two games with Italy is exciting and it wouldn't be the World
Cup without Poland, would it?'' said Venables. ``It's a tough group, but I
think the public now understand there aren't any soft games.
``Moldova and Georgia overwhelmed Wales and they will be very strong.''
But the main threats are Italy and Poland, qualifying opponents for the fifth
time in 22 years. The Italians have not lost to England for 18 years, while the
Poles ended Sir Alf Ramsey's hopes back in 1973.

Ross Finlay finds
something extra in a six-gear Audi
RUNNING out of time on a test drive, I decided to put the Audi A6 into a
three-point turn and head back the way I had come. I fumbled for reverse and
discovered, to my dismay, that I had a box full of forwards. On events like
this, with the manufacturer's representatives back at base, unfortunate
incidents do happen.
A colleague who once returned a car with a shunted front end described
graphically how he had had to swerve to avoid a loose sheep on the road, and
cannoned into a wall. It was either the wall or the sheep. Everybody
sympathised, until another colleague who lived locally pointed out that, at
that time of the farming year, there would not have been a sheep within five
miles.
Transmission derangements are usually put down as the ham-fisted driver's
fault. Wanting to avoid that embarrassment, I peered at the gear lever, and
suddenly noticed what I had forgotten during the drive. The numbers on the knob
went from one to six, and reverse was out on a limb of its own.
This A6 was the turbo diesel 140 version with a six-speed box. I had thought up
till then that it was not as relaxed and long-legged as claimed, but that was
because, as well as forgetting where reverse lay, I had never got the Audi out
of fifth.
There are arguments about whether six-speed boxes are anything more than a
gimmick. When fitted to performance cars which have enough power and torque to
romp around with a three-speed transmission, let alone a four or five, they may
represent an over-egging of the technical pudding.
But when it comes to economical cruising, there is a definite appeal in a car
which will pull a really high sixth gear, always assuming that the engine is
flexible enough not to hiccup at the first sniff of a hill. The Audi A6 TDI 140
provides the most impressive combined performance/economy figures of any diesel
powered car on the market.
As the model designation suggests, the 2.5-litre five-cylinder turbo diesel
engine peaks at a very high 140bhp. An oil cooler, modifications to the fuel
injectors, and tinkering around with the electronics give it 25bhp extra over
the ordinary 2.5 TDI. It will pull over 33mph for every 1000rpm of engine
speed, and provides the phenomenal torque figures of a 214lb ft peak at under
2000rpm.
So there is power and flexibility, as well as ultra high gearing to show the
low-revving diesel engine at its best. In a roomy saloon or estate you can
expect something like 64mpg at 56mph, 46 at 75 and 37mpg around town.
But there is class-leading performance too. The TDI 140 will sprint to 60mph in
about 9.5 seconds, hit nearly 130mph on a test track, and murder its own
petrol-engined relatives in rolling acceleration.
When you add a well designed interior, and good passenger space, this car ought
to be in a class of its own. Some day soon it probably will be, but for the
moment the A6 is one of the older stagers in the Audi line-up. That brilliant
engine and optimistic transmission are installed in a car which is essentially
of the 1980s, based on the superseded Audi 100.
As in many cars with antecedents of that kind, wind and tyre noise are quite
pronounced. While ride quality is fine for the class, the A6 is a design
generation back in handling. It is more cumbersome when being pressed on
smartly than the newer and admittedly smaller A4.
Prices range from #23,500 to #27,177 according to body style and trim levels,
and a four-wheel drive quattro version has been introduced from #27,516. Twin
airbags are standard since the start of this month.
The present model's expected replacement may add higher-speed handling
qualities in advance of what is available now, but this A6 already has the
beating of its rivals in its outstanding combination of performance and economy.

MODERN houses offer much more comfort and warmth than those of the past, but
they don't usually have as much character as their older counterparts. So when
a building company with a strong ``modern'' track record redevelops an old
building by an important architect, the result is . . . well, our picture says
much of it.
An unusual opportunity has been created to live in a traditional house - with
all the benefits of up-to-date comforts, conveniences and building techniques.
CALA Homes' Auchenbothie site at Kilmacolm offers such a choice of lifestyle -
something old or something new? The scheme consists of modern executive housing
dotted around Auchenbothie House - a nineteenth-century mansion by the
important Scottish architect William Leiper, a specialist in churches and large
houses. His Glasgow kirks include Dowanhill Church, Hyndland Parish Church,
Victoria Park Church, and Camphill Church in Queen's Park.
He also designed commercial and civic buildings such as Partick Burgh Halls,
Dumbarton Town Hall and Burgh Academy, and the French Renaissance style Sun
Life Assurance Building on Glasgow's West George Street. Not to mention the
facade of Templeton's Carpet Factory on Glasgow Green - a daring interpretation
of the Doges' Palace in Venice.
While he was developing his reputation as a church and commercial architect,
Leiper was also much in demand as a designer of private houses. These included
Cornhill house near Biggar and Dalmore in Helensburgh. He had the ability to
design in widely different styles - French and Italian Renaissance buildings
were built in parallel with others which were influenced by Alexander ``Greek''
Thomson.
Auchenbothie was was built in 1898 in the seventeenth-century Scots style with
turrets, harling, crow steps, bay windows, dormer windows, and courtyard.
Now a total of ten apartments have been created in the house, all of them with
one or two bedrooms. They include a large two-bedroom apartment which takes up
the whole of the second floor. It has views in all directions, a hexagonal
dining room built into the largest of the towers, and a roof terrace which is
approached via a spiral staircase from the living room.
Other apartments have rooms built into the original turrets, some of them
grouped around the courtyard.
Meanwhile, some 15 modern detached CALA houses are being built in the extensive
groundsof the main building. Prices range from #92,000 for the apartments and
from #192,000 for the four-  and five-bedroom detached modern houses.

NAIRN striker John Davidson has been banned for nine games after having
received three red cards in one match. Davidson was ordered off against
Fraserburgh a week ago for a second bookable offence.
He picked up a second red card from referee David Patience for swearing as he
walked from the park, and a third for challenging the official after the game,
although he claims he never spoke to the referee at that point.
County manager Harry McFadden said: ``John has been banned for exceeding the
disciplinary points level, not for bringing the game into disrepute. He
maintains he wasn't swearing at the referee, but was unhappy at the foul being
awarded.''
Davidson has been suspended for two games for the red cards, three additional
games for the hat trick, and four for passing the points threshold. The player
has now threatened to give up the game for the rest of the season.
``By the time the ban is over my fitness will have dropped and there will only
be four or five games left to play,'' he said. ``I don't know if it would be
worth carrying on.''
q THE referee's jurisdiction lasts from the moment he arrives at the ground
until he leaves.
Any player guilty of misconduct - before or after the 90 minutes - is subject
to a referee's report to the SFA.

JUST as the winter really begins to bite, a house with a cosy ingleneuk
fireplace seems like the ideal home. But The Lodge offers more than a winter
retreat. Standing on the shores of Loch Goil, this unusual example of delicate,
almost filigreed Victorian architecture is a property for all seasons.
When the spring brings back the first of the watery sunlight to the west of
Scotland, the sun lounge offers a chance to feel the rays without feeling the
cold. And when real summer weather returns, the elegant balconies and covered
verandahs offer you a refreshing breath of fresh air without having to leave
the premises. With more than 200 yards of loch frontage, the house offers an
outdoor lifestyle at any time of year.
The ranch-style lodge is believed to date back to around 1860 and is a delicate
piece of work that seems to defy the term ``stone-built''. It has eight main
apartments and a self-contained granny wing. Under
the slate roof and behind the stone detailing, the drawing room has splendid
wood panelling, a vaulted ceiling, that ingleneuk with its snug seats for
coorying up to the fire, and a large bay window with views across Loch Goil.
French doors lead to a covered verandah.
The lounge also has a large bay window with views of the sea and its fireplace
contains a wood-burning stove. The dining room has a large stone fireplace,
parquet flooring - and more open views. It also has access to the sun room, a
space 16ft by 8ft which is glazed on three sides and has a quarry tile floor
and double doors opening on to the garden.
The kitchen has a south-facing picture window and comes with a gas-fired hob
and an oil-fired Aga. Upstairs are three bedrooms. The main bedroom has a
beamed ceiling, views southwards across the loch and an en-suite bathroom. The
four-apartment granny or guest suite has a living room, kitchen, three bedrooms
and a box room.
Outbuildings include two garages, laundry, workshop, woodstore and coal cellar.
The Lodge is located about 2.5 miles outside Lochgoilhead village in Argyll, on
the road to Carrick Castle. It sits at the foot of the hills, sheltered among
trees in a garden of around 1.7 acres which includes lawns, kitchen garden,
Victorian fountain, and a variety of mature trees and shrubs running down to
the loch shore. The garden also contains a summer house - for those idyllic
days when the ingleneuk season is only a faint memory.
Clyde Property is seeking offers over #195,000 for The Lodge.

England 1, Portugal 1
ENGLAND received a taste of things to come in next summer's European
Championship when a technically clever Portuguese side, comfortable qualifiers
for the finals, outmanoeuvred them for much of the night at Wembley, earning a
deserved draw.
Sadly, there was further evidence that it would be unwise to build either a
team strategy or too many hopes around Paul Gascoigne. The Rangers man's header
over the bar four minutes from time followed a rare sortie into the opposing
penalty area.
There was a deserved first start for Nottingham Forest's Steve Stone, after two
successful cameos as a substitute, and he celebrated with a goal after 44
largely uneventful minutes. Les Ferdinand chested down Stuart Pearce's cross
and Stone's aim was low and true from 20 yards out.
That was a setback for Portugal, a gifted young side beaten only once in their
previous 15 matches, whose movement off the ball and interchanging were so good
that it was impossible to pin down who was playing in which position.
Alan Shearer must have welcomed the extra power of Les Ferdinand alongside him
at least as much as Teddy Sheringham's more subtle approach that had worked
well against Switzerland last month. It was disappointing that Ferdinand had to
make way for his Newcastle team-mate Peter Beardsley because of a groin strain
midway in the second half.
By then, Portugal were level. Little Dominguez, playing wide on the right, fed
a shrewd pass through the middle and with Tony Adams distracted by Sa Pinto's
run and Steve Howey badly positioned, the lanky Paulo Alves hit a fierce shot
past David Seaman.
A triple substitution 10 minutes from the end almost worked for Venables as
well. Aston Villa's Gareth Southgate had played less than a minute of
international football when he headed a right-wing corner against the bar.
Venables' view, which cannot have been shared by many of the 29,000 present,
was: ``At half-time we were the better side. Then they had a good spell, but
when we put fresh legs on, we got back into it.''
He added, less controversially: ``They were a very, very good team and another
three workouts like that before next June would be ideal for us.''
ENGLAND - Seaman, Neville, Pearce, Wise, Adams, Howey, Barmby, Gascoigne,
Shearer, Ferdinand, Stone. Substitutes - Flowers, Le Saux, Southgate,
Beardsley, McManaman.
PORTUGAL - Neno, Carlos Secretairo, Dimas, Costa, Couto, Sousa, Figo, J Pinto,
S Pinto, Helder, Folha. Substitutes - Rui Carreira, Pedro, Dani, Domingos,
Paulo Alves.
Referee - R Pederson (Norway).
q.BIRMINGHAM captain Liam Daish will miss the rest of his side's Anglo-Italian
Cup action as organisers reacted to last month's brawl in Ancona.
Daish would have led his side against Cesena in today's group game at St
Andrews, but the club have agreed to a request to leave him out. However, a
carefully worded statement stressed that the decision does not mean any
individual has been found guilty of inflicting injury during a flare-up after
the match on November 15, when Ancona coach Massi Cacciatori was taken to
hospital with a fractured jaw and damage to his left eye.

PAUL Bernard's wish is to follow Eoin Jess into the Scottish side for the
European Championship finals next summer. The midfield man has marvelled at the
skills of his Aberdeen team-mate since moving from Oldham.
Bernard, who already has two caps from Scotland's Far East tour last summer,
said yesterday: ``I knew Eoin from our days together with Scotland's Under-21
side and always respected his ability.
``Since joining Aberdeen I can see why he is back in the Scotland side. He is
certainly justifying his place.''
Meanwhile, Dons' captain Stewart McKimmie returns from suspension tonight for
the rescheduled match against Kilmarnock at Pittodrie, which was abandoned last
Wednesday after floodlight failure, but Scott Booth and John Inglis are ruled
out through injury.
Kilmarnock's Tom Black is almost certainly out, suffering from tonsillitis.

SCOTLAND team manager Craig Brown sat for close to one-and-a-half hours here at
the Louvre in Paris yesterday to find out his World Cup fate. When the decision
arrived and Brown saw the group Scotland had been drawn in he admitted: ``This
section is winnable.''
The delay was caused by Sepp Blatter, general secretary of FIFA, aided by a
host of sporting superstars, trawling through the 170-nation qualifying process
which will involve 639 games worldwide. Europe, predictably, was the last area
to be drawn.
Initially, the Scots had hoped to avoid a six-team section because of the
fixture problems which may militate against them. But when Brown eventually
watched as the major players for the next World Cup, Germany, Italy, and Spain
vanish into other sections he realised that perhaps his luck was running well.
Eventually, Scotland found themselves with Sweden as the top team in their
group, and Austria from the stream of sides just below them. They also found a
trio of sides from the newly emerging nations in Eastern Europe. Estonia,
Latvia, and Belarus are there to add some mystery to the qualification.
Scotland's group was drawn by AC Milan's George Weah and former France
international star Just Fontaine at the glittering ceremony which began with
Michel Platini catching a ball headed by an image of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona
Lisa. However, president Jacques Chirac, who was scheduled to address the
audience, did not show up.
Compared to England, who must play Italy, Brown has reason to feel satisfied.
Predictably, he made warning noises. He stressed that Belarus could be a
threat, but they are not the kind of threat which might have been posed by, for
instance, Croatia. When pressed, the Scotland manager said: ``The group is
winnable. We can, given some luck, end at the top and qualify without having to
face a play-off match.
``We know the Austrians. We played them recently and we won in Vienna. We know
Sweden, too, having met them in Stockholm just six weeks ago. We lost, but
there was nothing which would seriously worry us. Sweden, of course, are there
as seeds because they finished third when the last World Cup was played in the
United States.
``They will be hurting now because they have not qualified for the European
Championships, but we will recognise that, just as we recognise the threat from
Belarus. Too many people write off the `new' nations, but they have, many of
them, a strong football tradition and a very organised infrastructure.
``The group is not easy, but we have a 50-50 chance of qualification.''
Jim Farry, the SFA chief executive, revealed that he and Brown will travel to
Vienna on January 17 to discuss the complicated dates situation. He said: ``We
have to fit in 10 matches, at least, by November 1997. That is not as easy as
it may sound. Four of the countries we are playing, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia,
and Belarus all have lengthy winter shut-downs. It looks as if we will have to
play matches in our own close season to make sure that the fixtures are
fulfilled.''
Farry again stressed, as he did in these pages on Monday, that the possibility
of weekend games, and double-headers would come into play.
He pointed out: ``It would seem the best way for us to do things. We could take
the squad to Latvia, and to Estonia, and play two matches back-to-back without
disrupting the domestic programme too much.''
In the meantime, Brown has to prepare his team for the Championships in England
in the summer. That is why they will avoid World Cup games before then,
although the qualifying programme begins in March.
Farry said: ``We must concentrate on one thing at a time. We have to look to
the finals in England. We are preparing, at the moment, to play one, or
possibly two, warm-up games in the United States on May. These will be in
either Boston or New York.''
Despite increasing speculation to the contrary, there is little doubt that
Brown will continue as international team manager. His contract, in that role,
ends in July. He knows  that a major part of his role at the SFA is to act as
technical director, to help with the youth programme, to help bring on young
talent, and to encourage the spread of a coordinated coaching system, one where
the nation will follow a lead from the SFA.
However, Brown is likely to guide the national side's fortunes into the World
Cup qualifying campaign just as he will do in the European Championships in the
summer. He is a man appointed by the SFA and they are unlikely to change their
views of his position especially following the qualification for England.
The one man wearing a frown in the SFA delegation was commercial director Bill
Wilson. A match with Italy, or Germany, or even Spain, would have given a huge
financial boost. Other draws:
Caribbean Zone: First round - A Aruba v Dominican Republic, B Bahamas v St
Kitts and Nevis, C Guyana v Grenada, D Dominica v Antigua. Second round: 1
Bermuda v Trinidad and Tobago, 2 Puerto Rico v St Vincent, 3 Cayman Islands v
Cuba, 4 Winner B v St Lucia, 5 Winner C v Haiti, 6 Surinam v Jamaica, 7 Winner
D v Barbados, 8 Winner A v Netherlands Antilles.
Third round: Teams drawn into pairs with winners (A, B, C, D) going into
semi-final phase. Winners qualify for semi-final phase.
Central American Zone: E Nicaragua v Guatemala, F Belize v Panama. Winners
qualify for semi-final phase.
Semi-final phase: Group 1 - United States, Costa Rica, Winner E, Winner D.
Group 2 - Canada, El Salvador, Winner A, Winner F. Group 3 - Mexico, Honduras,
Winner B, Winner C.
Top two in each group go into final phase (league system). Top three in final
phase qualify for finals in France.
South America: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru,
Uruguay and Venezuela (play in a single group on a league system). Top four
qualify for finals in France, plus Brazil, who qualify automatically as
champions.
Africa Zone: Cameroon, Nigeria, Egypt and Morocco exempt from first round.
First round - Sudan v Zambia, Namibia v Mozambique, Tanzania v Ghana, Swaziland
v Gabon, Uganda v Angola, Mauritius v Zaire, Malawi v South Africa, Madagascar
v Zimbabwe, Guinea-Bissau v Guinea, Rwanda v Tunisia, Congo v Ivory Coast,
Kenya v Algeria, Burundi v Sierrra Leone, Mauritania v Burkina Faso, Togo v
Senegal, Gambia v Liberia. Second round: First round winners plus Cameroon,
Nigeria, Egypt and Morocco will be drawn later into five groups of four with
group winners qualifying for finals.
GROUP 4
SWEDEN
SCOTLAND
AUSTRIA
LATVIA
BELARUS
ESTONIA
There will be 14 qualifiers from Europe plus France, who qualify automatically
as hosts. The nine group winners and the best runner-up qualify. The other
eight runners-up will be drawn into pairs for play-offs with the play-off
winners qualifying.

YOUR columnist Ian Bell (December 9) seemed to enjoy the programme which cut
down Robert Baden-Powell to size, The Secret Lives. Its modern opinions applied
to the past may sound convincing enough.
Inadequate psychology, however, if ineptly applied, can create all sorts of
mischief. Worse, the object of its destructive intent is no longer in a
position to defend himself, to repudiate its facile accusations.
The Bell has a hollow ring, and sounds symptomatic of the sickness our society
suffers from.
Like everyone else, Baden-Powell was a product of the times in which he lived.
He belonged to a militaristic and colonising England, and was under orders to
uphold its values. If he enjoyed such ghastly blood-sports as pig-sticking,
then he and his England were no more pig-sick than countries which to this day
permit bull-fighting.
His admiration of young boys did not turn him into a pervert. Any sound
educationist is permitted to admire children in order the better to educate
them. It is those who dislike children who make the worst educators.
His reputed unease with women seemed to evaporate as soon as he met the right
one.
Interestingly enough, Baden-Powell had no intention at first of founding an
organisation. The movement grew from seeds sown in the hearts of healthy boys
and girls. The adulation they accorded him he received with modesty and grace,
and with no little surprise.
It was a great deal healthier than the destructive sneers which mere cynicism
accords him at the hands of those who have achieved exactly what for young
persons?

I CAN only assume that Ian Bell (December 9) did not like being a Cub many
years ago! His malevolent diatribe against Baden-Powell makes John Macleod seem
like a benign wit.
B-P's vision has enthralled young people for 90 years. This makes him liable to
jealous attacks from sad, embittered people who have achieved nothing for the
benefit of others.
Ian Bell is obviously one of these and told us a lot about himself in his
article. My advice to him is to visit a Scout group and then write another
article.

IT was reported on December 8 that six cows had been seized by trading
standards officers in a BSE-related investigation. It transpires that the
beasts were sold at Lanark having been declared free of the disease. The six
cows then being transported for slaughter at Biggar were not the same ones but
carried the same paperwork.
The next time you bite into some British beef ask yourself if it came from a
sane or a mad cow. If the Lanark incident is anything to so on you will never
know if your bit of beef was mad or a potential PhD student.

CONFUSION reigns after Hamish Paton's article (December 7). He asserts there is
a distinct possibility of a tax cut and not a tartan tax when a devolved
parliament in Scotland assumes its powers in about 18 months' time.
He went on: ``An independent Scotland oil-rich and debt-free could rapidly
regain its place among the wealthiest nations on the planet''. Planet indeed!
Even the rather self-effacing George Roberston, Labour's Shadow Secretary of
State, may be somewhat taken aback by the sheer exuberance of Mr Paton's
visions for the future.
In any event it is time that a more authoritative statement on the financial
implications of devolution be made by the Labour Party to resolve the many
ambiguities of the current situation.
The electorate need to know how the 130 members of the Scottish parliament
(plus the unspecified number of auxiliary jobs) are to be financed.

W M FRASER is correct to question the witch-hunt for drunk drivers (December
11). I also would welcome a ``serious and impartial'' investigation into the
hard facts of road injuries and deaths.
There can be no doubt that the vast majority of accidents are caused by bad
driving when sober. It would therefore seem to make more sense to target
incompetent and careless drivers all year round.
The current campaign may indeed be costing rather than saving lives.

Margaret Vaughan reports how the money men have succeeded where the Green lobby
failed - in striking a death blow against nuclear power
DING, dong the witch is dead. The wicked witch of the West, the nuclear power
industry, killed not in the end by the gleeful Green lobby who are dancing on
her grave but by the City Suits who say she is too costly to keep in the manner
to which we have become accustomed.
The death blow was delivered after a shrewd look at the books convinced them
there was no way a privatised nuclear industry lumbered with huge costs for
decommissioning, disposal of spent fuel, and a #5.5 billion bill for building
two new power plants, could make attractive returns to shareholders.
British Energy's decision to drop plans to build the two remaining nuclear
reactors on its books marks the end of Britain's 50-year experiment with
nuclear power.
That nuclear power was feared for its dangers had, in the end, little bearing
on the decision to kill it off. More fatal was that it looked uneconomic. The
announcement seems almost paradoxical: if nuclear power is uneconomic, how can
it possibly be privatised? Easy, is the answer, if the Government, in hey
presto mode, simply writes off the massive debt accumulated by the industry.
City analysts believe the sale of British Energy will raise somewhere between
#2 billion and #3 billion for its eight power stations, including two in
Scotland. Yet Sizewell B alone cost more than #2 billion to build.
But the decision to halt the planned construction of PWR power plants at
Hinkley and Sizewell will help smooth the path to privatising the holding
company, British Energy which was formed recently out of the most commercials
bits of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear. The Government is counting on
the proceeds from the privatisation in its plans to reduce public sector
borrowing in the run up to the election.
British Energy argues that there is no reason to build any new power stations.
The price of electricity in the UK has steadily declined because of the falling
price of gas and the existence of spare capacity. It claims that low natural
gas prices have changed the economics of power generation in an uncertain
energy market.
Although the UK will go on producing some nuclear energy until around the year
2035, for Richard Killick, who was Scottish Nuclear's director of safety and
quality until a few months ago, the announcement means that the industry is now
condemned to a slow, lingering death.
Scotland's two nuclear stations, at Torness and Hunterston, produce half of
Scotland's electricity needs: ``The implication is that when they come to the
end of their lives they will not be replaced by nuclear stations. The ultimate
decision point is still five years away but that they don't believe that the
nuclear industry will be viable in future is all the more threatening.''
Mr Killick grew increasingly uneasy about the safety implications of
privatisation before he left in September. He is even more worried now: ``It
seems to me an interesting implication that the people who a couple of years
ago were pressing for the privatisation of the industry as the only way to save
it are now going to kill it off.''
He fears that safety may become a lesser priority as the British Energy
directors' attention is diverted elsewhere. ``My feeling is that the industry
will be pruned as much as they think they can get away with.
``If you are seriously running down the industry, that affects morale. If
people are worried about their jobs and don't feel the top management's main
concern is the nuclear element, I fear you are on a dangerously slippery
slope.''
But if environmental groups, who welcome the last gasp of their old nuclear
energy enemy, are correct and the power industry must look to other sources,
what will they be?
Coal is out of fashion, the mining industry virtually destroyed. You would have
to be a couple of lentils short of a cutlet to believe that wind, wave and the
power of chicken shit is likely to arise to replace the bad old nuclear bag in
the immediate future.
Most money is on gas. A typical nuclear plant costs as much as 10 times to
build as a modern gas-fired plant. But with the rundown of cheap home supplies
of oil and gas, is it sensible to be contemplating a gas-only energy future?
International gas prices are low at the moment. But then so were oil prices in
the early seventies, until the oil crisis plunged the UK into an energy crisis
and a knock-on economic crisis. Quite, says Mr Killick, who continues to
believe there is a future for the UK's nuclear power plants with their
excellent safety records. Quite, says Graham Stein of Friends of the Earth, who
believes there is nothing to stop us replacing nuclear power with alternative
energy sources combined with better conservation measures. For instance?
``Wave power technology could easily be developed and the signs are
encouraging,'' says Mr Stein. But didn't the last prototype launched somewhere
in the North Sea sink just a few months ago? And isn't it the case that
windmills, or wind turbines, once universally seen as cuddly technology, are
now the source of great dissent within the Green movement?
There are about 400 turbines on 21 sites around Britain, twirling and
whooshing, feeding energy into the National Grid, and providing the grand total
of one-fifth of 1% of the country's electricity. And while a wind farm provides
one permanent job, the nuclear industry argues that the Sizewell station alone
would have created 6000 jobs on site and 8000 around the country during the
seven-year construction, while employing 450 staff once built.
The normal trade-off between employment and the environment is one thing. But
what about the concerns about the ill-effects on the environment of the sulphur
dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide of coal-fired stations? The gas
stations which, of course, also use fossil fuels surely add to the destruction
of the atmosphere, and the risk of global warming?
In the end then, is the death of the nuclear dream of cheap energy no more than
a short-term solution to a long-term problem?
Or, now that she's gone, will we begin to see the old witch's good points?

THE Greater Glasgow Health Board has announced a scheme for the provision of
out-of-hours medical care in treatment centres, which is intended largely to
replace home visits by doctors.
Not surprisingly this has been welcomed by representatives of the general
practitioners who have seen the number of house calls escalate in the past few
years, while the number of assaults on doctors performing these calls has also
increased.
This type of development is completely untested on a population the size of
Greater Glasgow, and the decision to retract services from the patient's home
to these treatment centres has not been mandated through any ballot box, so it
is legitimate for the people of Glasgow to ask why this is not initially going
to be introduced as a pilot scheme in one or two areas, and to ask when they
are going to be consulted about the changes.
This new service will be critically dependent upon an increase in the ambulance
service, which at times is unable to meet all the out-of-hours demands for
emergency transfer to hospital, and the public will need to be assured that
present services will not deteriorate further with this development.
The money for this scheme has been top-sliced, meaning that another part of the
NHS in Scotland will be cut to pay for this. It is interesting to note that
these centres will not be new-build, but will be located in existing premises,
and the two teaching hospitals which have expressed an interest are the
Victoria Infirmary and Stobhill.
The financial difficulties facing the Victoria Infirmary have received
widespread publicity. Less widely known is the dispute at the Glasgow Royal
Infirmary concerning the proposed transfer of all of the Victoria Infirmary
accident and emergency staff to the Royal Infirmary. Does the Greater Glasgow
Health Board intend to close accident and emergency services at the Victoria
and move these to the Royal Infirmary?
As always, the people of Greater Glasgow are deliberately being kept in the
dark, and until the GGHB is honest about its proposals we cannot assume, as
Danny Crawford hopes, that acute hospital closures in some form are off the
agenda.

Alf Young considers whether Scottish Enterprise in accepting a 7.5% budget cut
has capitulated or simply made the best of a bad situation - but where will the
cuts fall?
THE man accused of playing the ``political puppet'' role in Michael Forsyth's
Christmas 1995 pantomime production of How Captain Hook Raided Aladdin's Tartan
Piggy Bank was in London yesterday, earning his other living.
Scottish Enterprise chairman Professor Donald MacKay, much vilified by
Opposition MPs and sections of the media for apparently volunteering cuts of
#33m in the enterprise network's headline budget next year, was embroiled,
leading a team from his own economic consultancy Pieda, in the public inquiry
into BAA's plans for a fifth terminal at Heathrow.
MacKay's absence down south and his reluctance - beyond Monday's first formal
SE statement - to be interviewed on the 7.5% cut to #439m in the network's
allocation next year did nothing to still angry accusations that he had
connived in the Bothwell Street butchery for narrow political reasons. But is
that the whole story?
Was the MacKay-led Scottish Enterprise board an easy touch when the Scottish
Secretary came looking for real spending cuts? And, now that the enterprise
network knows the overall level of pain it has to absorb, where are the cuts
going to fall and what impact will they have on SE's ability to deliver the
``jobs and prosperity for the people of Scotland'' by which it expects to be
judged?
In the early stages of the PES round - as this annual haggle over budgets is
known to Whitehall insiders - it became clear that the Scottish Office wanted
real blood from Scottish Enterprise this year. No more standstill budgets,
eroded only by inflation. Real cuts, this time. The options finally canvassed,
say insiders, were cuts of 5%, 10% or 15% in the planned allocation.
Michael Forsyth claimed on Monday that his initial instinct was to go for a 10%
cut. Sources close to MacKay say he was prepared to go public on the damage
which would be done to the agency's ability to deliver meaningful economic
development if the cuts ran much higher than 7%. The final compromise, we now
know, was a cut of #33m or 7.5%, and an equivalent cut in Highlands &amp; Islands
Enterprise.
As part of the compromise Mackay insisted - and the Scottish Office agreed -
that, from April, there will be more flexibility for Scottish Enterprise to
move resources across the five funding blocks which make up its total budget.
These cover enterprise programmes; environment; youth training; adult training;
and management and administration.
A technical, albeit important, concession. But not one to placate those who see
the #33m cut as a mortal wound to the entire Scottish Enterprise experiment.
MacKay is, apparently, unbowed. He regarded some cuts as inevitable. His role,
he believed, was to reach a settlement which acknowledged that fact, but
inflicted minimum damage on the network's ability to do its job. ``He's played
this, not as Forsyth's poodle, but as a wily old fox,'' claims one admirer.
But precisely how does the wily old fox expect to get by on #33m less rations
next year, without doing any operational damage to the 13 cubs in the SE lair?
Scottish Enterprise already allocates more than 82% of its total budget to the
13 Lecs. So, unless the core operation in Bothwell Street withdraws from even
more national initiatives - and significant ones like Locate in Scotland and
Scottish Trade International are ring-fenced - some of the pain will have to be
spread around the network.
These detailed decisions start now. We won't know the outcome until January.
But it is possible to chart some of the options. Listening to Mr Forsyth's
simplistic formula - ``cut back on administration, raise efficiency, and
concentrate on the essentials'' - the obvious target would appear to be the
#50m or so the network still spends on management and administration each year.
But there you quickly encounter a conundrum. The emphasis in much of what
Scottish Enterprise now does is business development - working with people who
want to start new businesses, working with existing businesses to help them
grow bigger, faster. But that kind of work requires high-calibre people,
whether staff or self-employed contractors, who can give businesses the kind of
support non-executive directors are expected to deliver in larger companies.
People of that calibre don't come cheap. So, given past assaults on bureaucracy
within the system, there is even an argument that more, not less, needs to be
spent in block five, which covers the network's running costs, if the Lecs are
to maximise their impact on the business development process. That said,
consultants may find the Scottish Enterprise train has run out of gravy by next
April.
The two other obvious block targets for savings are the adult training budget
and environmental spend. When Education and Employment Secretary Gillian
Shephard acknowledged her departmental allocation immediately after the budget,
she linked the 12% fall in long-term unemployment last year to the 4% reduction
in her allocation for employment and training programmes south of the Border
next year. We can expect an equivalent cut in SE's adult training budget and
greater pressure on employers to take more responsibility for skills training.
But cutting 4%, say, from a budget which totals around #80m this year across
the network, releases little more than #3m, just 10% of the #33m cut Professor
MacKay has accepted. More targets are needed for pruning.
What about environment? That block accounted for #78m in 1994/95 and the Lecs
are still under instructions, in the Scottish Secretary's latest operational
guidelines, to bring derelict brownfield land back into productive use. Many
senior Lec executives are bracing themselves for a hard cut-back on soft,
cosmetic environmental spend.
And then there's the infrastructure side of the big flagship projects - from a
national science centre to a Loch Lomond gateway to the Stirling project. The
lesson of the latest cuts for all of them is likely to be: If you don't raise
the wherewithal from the Millennium Commission or European structural funds,
forget it.
This is, of course, a dynamic process. Chairman MacKay believes he can leverage
further the private sector spending which magnifies the impact the SE budget
alone has. And there are assets across the network, including bricks and mortar
put on the ground since the great SDA factory sale of the late eighties, whose
value might be realised to help plug the budget gap. By January, the fox's
cards will be on the table.
It became clear that the Scottish Office wanted real blood from Scottish
Enterprise this year. No more standstill budgets, eroded only by inflation.

David Steele examines the efforts to put the Burns International
Festival back
on song
IT seemed like a good idea at the time. Take the fact that Scotland's bard died
200 years before, and use his name and influence to promote varied events aimed
at entertaining the locals and bringing in lots of visitors.
In the words of the mission statement of Burns International Festival 96: ``To
use the bicentenary of the death of Robert Burns as a catalyst to generate
additional economic activity in the south-west of Scotland by organising
events, helping market the area and promoting Burns.''
Fine so far, but then things started to go wrong and the rumblings began up and
down the country as one setback after another plagued the organisation of the
festival.
It is in this organisation, perhaps, where the key can be found as to why the
Burns International Festival has been described variously as a ``fiasco'', a
``shambles'', and a ``wasted opportunity''.
An 18-strong board of directors drawn from all the funding bodies, such as
local authorities and local enterprise companies, was left with the task of
drawing together a wide and varied festival. Many may see this as unwieldy and
a dangerous mixture of enthusiasm and ignorance.
They were to be guided in this by John Struthers, the former theatre and
festival director in various parts of England, who was brought in as director.
The vision he had then is still there despite the knocks, according to
Struthers.
He said: ``I had, and still have, a vision of a festival which brings together
community-based events and international attractions. This is a remarkable
opportunity to commemorate one of the greatest writers and poets and is an
opportunity which must not be missed.''
Mr Struthers will have to go cap in hand to a variety of places in the coming
weeks and there is no guarantee of the extra cash which will release the purse
strings of the EU to let much-needed support cross the Channel.
Unlike some of his board members he is slow to blame the media and is often
refreshingly honest in his comments. ``Yes, many mistakes have been made by me
and by others in the organisation but now we must put these behind us and move
forward to make sure the festival is a success.
``The media have occasionally been critical but too often we were not able to
tell them a full enough story of what was going on.''
The early events are a curious mixture of visual arts, fireworks, ploughing,
reading, reciting, and singing. Perhaps Burns would have approved, but the jury
is still out on that one.
What is for sure is that for the bicentenary to fail in its goal to promote
tourism and bring Burns to an even wider audience would be a crime.
Now Mr Struthers has been told by some of the board that they want more big
names and he must look again at the later programme. It is a tricky one.
He added: ``There is a school of thought that we should be out looking for big
names but the funding is not there. Now I am asking the existing funders,
coupled with a few new ones, to take a leap of faith and make more money
available which will be matched from Europe.
``I know everyone is strapped for cash but it is very important for us to get
the funding right. I will be looking at a wide range of possibilities and I am
still hopeful that commercial sponsorship will be in place in the coming weeks
in time for the later events.''
He is naturally reticent about naming names - a habit which has got him into
trouble in the past - but Mr Struthers has made it clear that major companies
are nibbling but they have yet to bite.
The biting will probably come when he has something more substantial for them
to chew on. In the meantime, the songs and verse will ring out all over the
world much as it does every January.
Whether 1996 is really all that different remains to be seen. As the bard wrote:
The best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft a-gley.

JONATHAN Edwards - lovely fellow, god-fearing, kind to animals - was named as
the BBC Sports Personality of the Year the other night, voted for by you the
viewers. It is not his fault that his specialist event, the triple jump, is
just about as exciting as synchronised draughts.
Frankly, I have great difficulty in believing that thousands of people wrote in
to say that Jonathan gave them the biggest sporting thrill of 1995. Or that
Frank Bruno came second in anything other than a two-horse race. But I am
probably just being cynical again.
Seriously though, is the BBC show, and its Scottish counterpart, not just a wee
bit stereotyped in its approach? Is it not time to organise a new kind of
sporting award and give the public a real role to play?
Just for the record, my 1, 2, 3 in the BBC list would have been Bernard
Gallacher, because he inspired a Ryder Cup victory that produced the most
thrilling climax of the year; Mike Atherton, for restoring some of England's
cricket pride almost single-handedly; and Stephen Hendry as he is, and has been
for some time, unarguably the best in the world at what he does.
I would create new categories, too. Manager of the year, open to all sports,
featuring Kevin Keegan, Craig Brown, Ian Doyle, Allan McGraw - and Terry
Venables for seeing off a record number of inquiries into his business affairs.
Spoilt brat of the year would be an interesting competition. I would let the
fans pick this one, perhaps by telephone poll.
One would expect Linford Christie to sprint to victory in this category but
let's not dismiss lightly the claims of Eric Cantona, Nick Faldo, Damon Hill,
or Brian Moore, who would be likely to achieve a landslide in the Scottish vote.
The ``you must be kidding, ref'' award could be voted on by referees and
umpires of every sport and go to the player or official who has irritated them
most in the past 12 months. Willie Miller would be the presenter.
Gazza might be the winner for several years, though our own Peter Wright should
pick up the Hawick vote. Video evidence of Jim Farry in action has been
disallowed.
Worst shot of the year would be an interesting diversion. This year's might
include Costantino Rocca's collapsing chip into the Valley of Sin at the Open,
Hearts keeper Henry Smith's missed penalty, and the one fired by the Brazilian
clay-pigeon expert which blew off his little finger.
Unluckiest sports personality of the year is likely to be a close-run thing.
Curtis Strange is a strong candidate, having been unfortunate enough to be
specially selected for the US Ryder Cup team, as is Peter McNeeley, who went 89
seconds with Mike Tyson, and any footballer who bumps into the procurator
fiscal of Glasgow.
For the most boring game of the year I would nominate the recent Boland-England
cricket match, which was cut from four days to one because it was so
uninspiring. No, any cricket match does not qualify.
Worst quote of the year could bring nominations from sports writers from up and
down the land. My own contribution would be from Mr Will Carling, who, when
asked for his highlights of England's Grand Slam win over Scotland, replied:
``Nothing particular,'' and then wrote an article detailing them for a Sunday
newpaper.
Worst sports columnist of the year? No, we are not having any of that nonsense.
I would mention the TV commentator who managed to miss a goal, except that I
sent the wrong score from a rugby match recently, and I do hate cast-ups.
q FOLLOWING last week's column, Jim Telfer, director of everything at the SRU,
rang to tell me he never said that Scottish rugby did not need heroes, though
he fully accepts that he was quoted on those terms in several newspapers.
Always happy to put the record straight.

ATHLETICS
BEWARE the wrath of a husband scorned. Lyudmila Narozhilenko, the world indoor
sprint hurdles record-holder, has been reinstated after serving 34 months of a
four-year suspension for a steroid doping offence, writes Doug Gillon.
The International Amateur Athletic Federation cited ``exceptional
circumstances'' yesterday in announcing the Russian's return.
Narozhilenko protested her innocence, denying all knowledge of the drugs which
were conclusively present in her urine sample, and threatening legal action.
Her husband eventually confessed he had spiked her food following the breakdown
of their marriage.
This admission has been known to the IAAF for at least two years, butthe
hurdler has still served the bulk of her sentence, missing two world outdoor
and one European championship.
Also reinstated under the same rule at the Monaco council meeting was German
endurance runner Iris Biba, whose coach admitted he had given her steroids.
BELFAST has been awarded the 1999 World cross-country championships. The 1997
Grand Prix final will be in Fukuoka, Japan, while Slovakia, marking 100 years
of athletics activity, will host the World Half Marathon Championships (in
Kosice), and the World Race Walking Cup (in Podebrady).
ALL athletes are invited to an open meeting tomorrow (7.30) in Meadowbank
Stadium Lounge. Edinburgh's new development officer, Norrie Williamson, wants
competitors of both sexes and all abilities, from track and field,
cross-country, and road and hill-running, to air their views.
American football
THE Scottish Claymores have cut their ticket prices in half for next season's
World League matches at Murrayfield. The price of adult tickets is halved from
#20 to #10, with children under 14 paying #2 instead of #5.

from the Canadian championships, and confident that she can achieve her
ambition of a third Olympic appearance at Atlanta next summer.
The 23-year-old from Milngavie and Bearsden claimed a silver medal with 25.8se
in the 50 metres free-style when she finished runner-up to US record-holder Amy
van Dyken, the fastest in the world this year. She also finished fourth in the

Rowing
HENLEY Regatta chiefs yesterday announced sweeping changes to their
qualification rules in a bid to prevent powerful regional and university clubs
pot-hunting in events designed for ordinary club and student crews.
The Thames Cup will be restricted to club crews, with all crews seeking
international representation barred. Only two former internationalists,
including lightweights, will be allowed per entry.
The Temple Cup will be restricted to student club crews, with Oxford and
Cambridge Blues and equivalent oarsmen from other institutions both at home and
overseas barred.
Also ruled out will be senior and under-23 internationalists, World Student
Games competitors, and previous winners of Henley events for seniors.

With a little help from their friends: Scott Murray is aided by fellow Scot
Barry Stewart as he outjumps Rob Fiddler, who also receives some support from a
colleague during last night's Under-21 international at Gateshead.
UNDER-21 INTERNATIONAL
England 21, Scotland 18
THE first international against the Auld Enemy at this level ended in a
three-point defeat and for Scotland scrum-half Graeme Beveridge it ended in
tears.
Scotland had clawed back from an 18-7 deficit at half-time. The Scots were all
square after an hour and it was not until five minutes from the end that a drop
goal put the English in front.
Three minutes into injury-time the Scots were awarded a penalty just outside
the English 22. A penalty goal would have secured an honourable draw but young
Beveridge chose to go for broke. He tapped the ball and ran, the move fizzled
out, and the referee blew for no-side. Beveridge was devastated.
The young Boroughmuir scrum-half, one of the finds of the season, had not found
the going as easy as he has on the club scene. None the less, he had laid on a
couple of Scottish tries and he did not deserve this.
Coach David Leslie said later: ``What we are trying to teach these lads is that
you have to win at international level, and if you can't win and the draw is
there for the taking, then take it. It was a tough call but Graeme knows it.
``What we're looking for, and what we're demanding are the right instincts at
the right time. Unfortunately, that last one wasn't quite right.''
The former Scotland flanker added: ``We are trying to teach these boys good
habits. First to win games, and secondly not to lose them.''
Scotland began poorly and had conceded 10 points within the first
quarter-of-an-hour.
Assistant coach John Rutherford had hoped that the Scots would have put the
English under pressure in the opening minutes but after six minutes England
opened the scoring with a soft try, scrum half Scott Benton nipping in
unopposed down the blind-side from a ruck inside the Scottish 22. Simon Binns
converted.
A Mike Duncan penalty attempt had struck the upright but stayed out before
Binns capitalised on extreme English pressure to spear home a penalty goal.
The big English forwards were proving a handful in the close-quarter stuff and
it would be into the third quarter before Scotland were to get their measure.
Nevertheless, after 22 minutes, and following some vigorous rucking by
Scotland, Graham Dall snaffled a ball at the lineout tail from an English throw
and from the ruck Gordon Bulloch charged through for a try which Duncan
converted.
A Binns penalty put England further ahead and a Chris Catling try gave the
English their 18-7 half-time lead.
Although Scotland had been under severe pressure for much of the first half
there were a number of plus points. In particular, the lineout worked well with
Guy Perrett and, specifically, Scott Murray taking some choice ball on the
touchlines.
Dall, cultured player that he is, linked well and was invariably first in the
break-down queue. Leslie, though, confided later that good player though the
young medical student is, he would like him to be much more of a predator.
The 1984 Grand Slam flanker merely gave one of those old-fashioned looks when
he was asked if this meant he would wish young Dall to flirt a wee bit more
with the offside line.
Scotland began the second half with a vengeance, giving credence to Leslie's
observation that a five-hour bus journey - and a host of players with
university exams coming up - is, perhaps, not the best preparation for
international rugby.
Mike Duncan kick-started the comeback with a penalty goal and followed this up
with a drop-goal after 54 minutes.
The equaliser came in 59 minutes, a surprise tap penalty by Beveridge inside
the English 22 setting Dall off, and David McLeish - who was later to suffer a
broken collar-bone - storming over for the try. It was all even, and the game
was definitely there for the taking. The Scots now rued the missed chances in
the first half when they had come away from the England 22 without scoring.
Scotland tackled well in the final 10 minutes as England mounted a last-ditch
effort. The fear for the Scots was that the line would not hold, and Binn's
drop-goal five minutes from the end proved to be the decisive score.
England Under-21 - C Catling (Exeter University); N Shaw (Durham University), J
Overend (Leicester), M Denney (Bristol), A Sleighholme (Wakefield); S Binns
(Leicester), S Benton (Gloucester); A Ozdemir (Harlequins), N McCarthy (Bath),

CRICKET
aJOHN Emburey was trying not to be too critical of his England A team last
night after the third Test was nearly thrown away in Peshawar.
A determined, unbroken ninth-wicket stand between Jason Pooley and Dean
Headley, who put on 49 in 52 minutes, eventually salvaged a draw and confirmed
England A's 1-0 series victory.
But there was an air of embarrassment in the English camp after a startling and
nervy afternoon collapse from 80 for two to 142 for eight which had left them
staring in to the eyes of defeat.
At tea England A were just 48 runs in front, but Middlesex left-hander Pooley
took charge with a show of confidence that will be of much interest to the
England selectors.
Emburey said: ``I don't want to sound over-critical because we've got the draw,
which is the most important thing. We've also won the series, which is what we
set out to do.
``But we didn't apply ourselves to the situation today and we will have to have
a chat about that once we sit down during the next couple of days to discuss
the limited-overs series which now ends this tour.''
Meanwhile, Mark Ilott's chances of playing in the third Test in South Africa
could depend on how quickly he recovers from a mild bout of food poisoning.
The Essex left-arm paceman missed yesterday's practice session after
complaining of an upset stomach following Monday night's visit to a Japanese
restaurant.
England expect Ilott to be back on parade today - and fighting for a place
against South Africa 24 hours later.
With Darren Gough ruled out by a hamstring injury, Ilott, Lancashire paceman
Peter Martin, and Worcestershire spinner Richard Illingworth appear to be
chasing one spot.
q.INDIA'S women are poised to win the third and final Test against England -
and square the series - in Hyderabad today.
England, who drew the first Test and won the second by two runs, go into the
last day requiring a further 264 runs for an improbable victory with nine
second innings wickets standing.
After Karen Smithies' side had slumped to 98 all out a disastrous second day,
India yesterday declared their second innings on 216 for seven, Chandra Kanta
Ahir top-scoring with 67 to help set England a victory target of 302.
Bradford's Helen Plimmer was then out for a duck before Jan Brittin (27 not
out) and Barbara Daniels (10 not out) guided the tourists to 38 for one by the
close.
q.SCOTTISH cricket legend George Goddard has been appointed to the
international selection committee.
Goddard, who earned 78 caps in a glittering national career spanning 23 years,
is the first recruit of new selection chief Bobby Hill, who said: ``I'm
delighted George has agreed to take on this role. He will command the respect
of all the players and should prove a tremendous asset for Scottish cricket.''
Spin-king Goddard took 154 international wickets and almost 1400 for Heriot's
before retiring last year, aged 57.

CURLING
SCOTLAND'S men and women assured themselves of quarter-final places with wins
over Germany in yesterday's play at the European Championships in Grindelwald,
Switzerland.
Yesterday morning, Hammy McMillan's men bounced back from their Monday night
loss to Norway, beating Andy Kapp's German team by 5-3, and they were followed
on to the rink by Kirsty Hay's women, who dominated their game over Germany's
former world champion Andrea Schopp, to win by 10-6 and retain their unbeaten
record.
In the men's game, Scotland won the toss but McMillan was too heavy with his
last stone draw to give first blood to Germany. The Scots brought the scores
back level at the second with a well-swept draw. In the fifth end, Kapp wrecked
on a guard with his last stone and Scotland stole a single to take the lead.
Germany drew level at the sixth, but Scotland moved clear at the seventh, when
the German sweepers touched one of the lying stones as they followed their own
last stone into the house. McMillan took this chance to draw for two.
Germany had a good chance to level again at the eighth but were too heavy and
could only score one. The Scots restored their two-shot advantage with a single
at the ninth and went on to win when Germany ran out of stones in the tenth end.
In the women's game, the teams swopped singles at the first two ends and, at
the third, Hay took advantage of her first real opportunity and drew her last
stone well to score two for a 3-1 lead.
Schopp responded straight away, scoring two in the next end to level the scores
again, but a confident hit on the nose by Hay in the sixth gave Scotland a
three from that end and a 6-3 lead.
Germany could only manage a single at the sixth and the Scots restored their
three-shot lead with a single at the seventh. A Hay take-out in the eighth end
did not completely clear the house and this gave Germany a chance for a two,
but the Scots made no mistake in the ninth end, scoring three again to move
further away and the Germans conceded the game halfway through the tenth end.
Both Scottish teams now have their final round-robin games today.
The men play Finland this morning, while later the women face Norway. Results:
Men: Round 4: Group A1 - Norway 7, Netherlands 4; Germany 3, Scotland 5;
Austria 5, Finland 3.
Standings (after four rounds) - Norway won 4, lost 0; Germany, Scotland 3-1;

BUILT at a cost of #1.2m, a new 22,000 sq ft extension to the hose and ducting
factory of Flexible Ducting Ltd at Cloberfield, Milngavie, has already resulted
in an increase in jobs and is regarded as both boosting production and
strengthening the firm's position as the leading manufacturer of flexible
ducting within the United Kingdom.
``We regard this investment as vital in our efforts to further strengthen our
UK position and to heighten our presence in Europe,'' said Mr Phil Battle,
director and general manager of Flexible Ducting Ltd.
``Apart from giving us the capacity to introduce new products, with the
benefits of additional warehousing space we will be improving the efficiency of
our service to distributors.
``It is also very satisfying to be able to secure the future for our workforce
and create additional employment for this area.'' The new extension, built by
John Dickie Construction, which includes both warehouse and office space, will
allow the company to create additional manufacturing space within the previous
main site and will boost overall production in heating, ventilation, domestic
appliance and industrial production.
Proud of its slogan ``Quality by Design'', Flexible Ducting Ltd, which employs
140 people, is a subsidiary of Smiths Industries. Four years ago it was the
first company in its industrial sector to achieve accreditation to BS 5750 Part
1/ISO 900l for the quality of its manufacturing systems. Heavy investments
backed by commitment to quality of product have been features throughout its
history.
Over 40% of the company's output is destined for use overseas.
When established over 34 years ago, the company was originally owned by the
Maclellan Rubber group. Smiths Industries, the UK conglomerate with interests
in aeronautics, defence systems and medical equipment, became the owners in
l977.
Steady growth, particularly over the past five years, has established the
Milngavie company in its position as a leading European ducting manufacturer.
It is now regarded as spearheading the growth of the entire Smiths ducting and
conduit division, which is represented by companies in the USA, Germany,
Switzerland and France.
Flexible Ducting's range of products has also continued to grow - a growth
further enhanced last year by the purchase of a range of products from a
competitor. While heating, ventilation and air conditioning remain among the
largest markets, the popular Thermaflex range can be found in HVAC systems in
hotels, aircraft, ships, offices and entire office blocks throughout the world.
The motor industry is another customer which takes a signficant part of the
output from Milngavie. Flexflyte Super is used in air intakes, heaters and
turbochargers. Underlining that established reputation for quality, Flexible
Ducting also supplies equipment to Rolls Royce, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Mercedes
Benz, and other top-end manufacturers.
Products for industrial use are manufactured for such widely varied uses as
carrying air, dust, fumes, cement powder, wood chippings and abrasive
substances including metal filings. Another expansion, in l990, was a venture
into the industrial hose market which followed on the acquisition of sole
European manufacturing and sales rights for an exclusive range of highly
flexible suction and discharge hoses from a Japanese company.
Known as Kanaline and a direct replacement for traditional rubber hose, it is
claimed to combine lightness and flexibility with a robust durability. It is
now widely used within the oil industry and in many other industries, including
processing, agriculture, chemicals and civil engineering.
A fourth area in which the Milngavie firm specialises, consumer durables, is
one in which marketing manager Mr Peter Samborek emphasises the paramount
importance of quality.
``Appliances in everyday use, such as hairdryers, tumble driers and vacuum
cleaners, require exceptionally high specification ducting to guarantee
durability,'' he said. ``European customers place great emphasis on quality and
demand that every piece of ducting is absolutely flawless. It is our policy to
meet these high standards as a matter of course.'' Strict quality control
procedures are in place at all times to ensure that every product leaving the
Flexible Ducting factory has been rigorously tested.
The range supplied in the consumer durables sector includes retractable hose
for use in upright vacuum cleaners produced by Electrolux, Hoover, Vax and
Dyson. High extension ratio hoses have also been introduced to allow these
companies to offer stair cleaning facilities on their machines.
A much praised facility offered to customers at Milngavie is an established
custom design department. Expert advice can be given on the requirements for
ducting or hose for specialised applications of every kind. This is a back-up
service backing a wide range of existing sales literature and published
guidance. It forms one more aspect of the ``Quality by Design'' motto and the
application behind it which has created the penetration of markets, both at
home and abroad, achieved by progresssive marketing by a strong sales network.
The ultimate proof is that even with the new major extension, the Milngavie
workforce is currently going flat-out to deal with demand.

A DATE was announced yesterday for South's postponed inter-district
championship match with the Exiles. They will meet at Richmond on Wednesday,
January 10, the kick-off time of 5pm representing a further nightmare for the
oft-vilified marketing men.
This decision follows the bizarre on/off saga of the Exiles' match against
North and Midlands next Sunday in Aberdeen. Last weekend, the N and M officials
and coaches, and several influential voices in the SRU, were all assuming that
their game would be postponed because of the loss of so many players to the
Stirling County v Heriot's FP Tennent's championship decider on Saturday. ``The
decision forcing us to go ahead with the game came as a shock to us,'' said Ian
Rankine, the N and M coach. ``On Sunday night a number of people in the SRU had
said there would be no point in playing the game,'' stated Rankine, who feels
disappointed that South should have been allowed to postpone their match with
the Exiles for the same reason.
Last night Midlands' secretary John Methven expressed more than disappointment.
He declared: ``SRU secretary Bill Hogg told us that the decision had been taken
by the general committee. He said he had phoned them and they have voted in
favour of the game going ahead.
``There is real fury in the North and Midlands and, I can tell you, that
resignations are being threatened.''
North coach Rankine said there is a possibility that the Stirling half-backs,
Ken Harper and Mark McKenzie, could be considered. ``But it would be too much
to ask any of the front five to play twice in 24 hours,'' said Rankine.
If,however, the Stirling halves were ruled out, there would be problems. One
avenue worth exploring for N and M would be offering the scrum-half berth to
Gary Armstrong, who, having spent some time at Dunfermline High School, has
district connections.
North, who had high hopes of lifting the championship, may have the bonus of a
return to duty by Martin Waite, with an outside chance that Scotland captain
Rob Wainwright will be fit by the weekend. The squad will have a practice
session tonight, but it may bear little resemblance to the team that takes the
field on Sunday.

TRYING Again looked an unconvincing recruit on his chasing debut and it is
worth opposing him and siding with Nemuro in the BBC Radio Devon Novices' Chase
today at Exeter. David Elsworth's useful handicap hurdler looked to have lost
his way last time when well-behind in the two-mile Newbury handicap won by
Eskimo Nel, but the truth could be he found the pace too hot.
However, to concentrate on his Newbury run would be to misrepresent his overall
form - the best efforts being a fine second to Thinking Twice in the
competitive Cordon Bleu Handicap Hurdle at Aintree and an easy win in the Welsh
Champion Hurdle in mid-April.
The net result of those runs though was an unfortunately high mark in the
ratings - cue the switch to the larger obstacles.
If he can take to fences, he can upset the likely favourite.

Oxford University 19,
Cambridge University 21
OXORD coach Lyn Evans slammed referee Tony Spreadbury after his award of a late
penalty try helped Cambridge clinch victory in an entertaining Varsity Match at
Twickenham yesterday.
But the official stood by his ruling that Oxford, desperately defending a 16-9
lead, were deliberately offside and preventing a try with three minutes to play.
Evans blasted: ``I did not think there was a probability of Cambridge scoring,
which is the definition required by the laws, and in any case, the ball was
dropped in the move.
``It was not the best decision he made during the match and it was not the sort
of decision to make in this situation.''
Spreadbury hit back: ``There was a tryscoring opportunity. I felt there were
players available for a try and it was deliberate offside.'' Inspired by the
penalty try, Cambridge snatched victory when hooker Jonathan Evans grabbed an
injury-time try and so rendered a record-breaking performance by Oxford
stand-off David Humphreys in vain.
Humphreys had collected 19 points to set a new Oxford record and equal Alistair
Hignell's Varsity Match mark.
The Oxford stand-off stroked over a drop-kick, three penalties and the
conversion of his own try to provide full value for the record 71,000 Varsity
Match crowd, who paid a record #1m to witness the first game under Twickenham's
floodlights.

MORNE du Plessis and Kitch Christie, who managed and coached the Springboks to
victory in the Rugby World Cup, will retain their posts for next year's New
Zealand tour of South Africa.
The pair had talked about resigning following South Africa's victory in their
first World Cup after being banned from the previous two because of apartheid.
But the South African Rugby Football Union said yesterday that they would stay
on for the new Tri-Nation series against Australia and New Zealand, followed by
the All Blacks' three-Test tour in August.
Du Plessis, a former Springbok, was credited with maintaining the squad's
emotional well-being throughout the World Cup amid tremendous pressure from
expectant South African fans.
He has been dropped as a selector for the Springbok side to affirm his
``paternal role'' as a confidante and advisor to the players, a SARFU statement
said.
Christie has coached South Africa to 14 straight Test victories, including six
in the World Cup that culminated with a 15-12 extra-time defeat of New Zealand.
The SARFU statement said Christie would only commit himself to staying on as
coach through the All Black tour.
Former Springbok Ray Mordt, who later played rugby league with Wigan, was
appointed as one of two assistant coaches to Christie.

SQUASH
PETER Nicol's career reached another peak yesterday, when he beat England's
Chris Walker in the final of the Mahindra International Challenge in Bombay and
became the first Scot to win a Super Series title.
The 22-year-old from Inverurie, who has had a disappointing start to the
season, comfortably beat Walker 15-8, 15-11, 15-10 to land his biggest cheque
of #12,000.
Following a tonsils operation in June, and a disastrous run of results, Nicol
dropped to No.8 in the world rankings, his lowest placing for 18 months. But
now he can look forward to making headway back towards his best placing of No.4
when the next list is announced on January 1.
``I'm absolutely delighted,'' said Nicol. ``Hopefully, this will be the first
of many. I had a really tough first-round match and just scraped home 3-2
against Egypt's Ahmed Barada. But I didn't drop another game, and really feel
I'm now reaching my best ever form.
``Because Jansher Kahn (world champion) was missing, I knew the chance was
there to win this title. But you've still got to go out and do it.''
Disappointingly, Nicol is not defending at the Scottish championships in
Edinburgh this weekend. After the arduous run of four Super Series events in
five weeks, he had already decided to take a long rest on his return from
Bombay.
His absence means that Martin Heath, who also proved his form in India with a
narrow 3-2 defeat from world No.2 Rodney Eyles, is favourite to win the
Scottish title for a first time.
In the women's championship, last year's winner, Claire Waddell, and world
No.21 Senga Macfie are joint favourites.

The Scottish Rugby Union's proposal that districts should represent Scotland in
Europe seems likely to come under fire.  At a meeting of the Premier League
Clubs' Association in Glasgow last night, it is understood that a majority of
representatives backed the idea of clubs carrying the flag for Scotland.
"The clubs will try to formulate a proposal which would allow a premier league
of eight to play their season through and at the same time accomodate three of
their member clubs participating in a European league," said the association's
David Kilshaw.
The meeting appears to have come out in favour of retaining some kind of
representative rugby being played in December and January as a stepping stome
to the international season.
"We do not think that European rugby played in October and November fits
comfortably as a precursor to international and even more so when the Five
Nations' championship moves back a fortnight," said Kilshaw, who feels that a
higher level of rugby in tghe two midwinter months might go some way to
answering the pleas of the Exiles for future involvement.
The next move for the association, in what is becoming a fascinating battle of
ideas, will be to design a working model  of next season and then to try to
lobby clubs outwith their association.
They are due to meet next in January, but by then it is expected that a
proposal to be put before the SRU will have been formulated.  Further momentum
is likely to be generated tonight at a meeting of the top 10 clubs.

England A 55,
Western Samoa 0
CENTRE Will Greenwood grabbed a hat trick as England A sent Western Samoa into
Saturday's Twickenham Test on the receiving end of a crushing whitewash at
Gateshead last night.
England A got the try count rolling as Gloucester flanker Richard West won a
lineout for Bath prop Kevin Yates to power through the gap. Bristol's Martin
Corry carried on the good work before Wasps scrum-half Andy Gomarsall darted
under the posts for full back Tim Stimpson to land the first of his six
conversions.
But the sluice gates in the Samoan defence were fully opened when Greenwood,
Andrew Blyth and wing Jim Naylor were all involved before the centre got the
first of his treble. Gloucester hooker Phil Greening burst through for a fine
try before Greenwood completed a break from outside-half Alex King by racing in
from halfway.
Saracens flanker Richard Hill charged over soon after the interval, then
Greenwood completed his hat-trick after a King interception. Gomarsall added
his second soon after, and Leicester prop Darren Garforth brought up the
half-century of points.
England A - T Stimpson (West Hartlepool); J Sleightholme (Bath), A Blyth (West
Hartlepool), W Greenwood (Harlequins), J Naylor (Orrell); A King (Bristol
University), A Gomarsall (Wasps); K Yates (Bath), P Greening (Gloucester), D
Garforth (Leicester), G Archer (Bristol), R West (Gloucester), M Corry
(Bristol), T Diprose (Saracens), captain, R Hill (Saracens).
Western Samoa - A Autagavaia; T Faaiuaso, S Leaega, K Tuigamala, F Fereti; C
Burnes, M Vaea; B Reidy, O Matauiau, G Latu, S Lemamea, M Birtwistle, captain,
L Taala, S Smith, M Iupeli.

I DON'T suppose when Scottish Ballet commissioned Peter Pan in 1989 that they
imagined something so unsecured - first full-length ballet for choreographer
Graham Lustig, first ballet score for composer Edward McGuire, first ballet for
designer Margaret Woznica - would end up being pressed into such regular
company service. At the time of its commissioning, the rising mood within the
company management was ``to try will be an awfully big adventure''. Now, as I
watch the dancers being hoist aloft, courtesy of Foy's clever wires, I have to
admit to a total plummeting of spirits. Because this was never a really
together ballet, ever.
Its magic was elusive and its sense of adventure chased itself in circles round
Neverland for the whole of Act Two. Tweeking took place. And yes, it has been
tweeked again. Even more of the over-literate stuff being stripped out. But
none of this can alter the bedrock fact that whatever's left is still always
going to lack the all-important tingle factor. What the company needs, for all
our sakes, is a shiny new Christmas ballet.
Not just to please the audiences, but because the dancers need, deserve,
something they can get their feet into. Watching them last night, I wished I
was the Lottery Fairy . . . It's nice that Maria Teresa Del Real has stayed on
a bit longer - that impudent hussy, Tinkerbell, is right up her street.
Vladislav Bubnov's Peter, kicks up his heels like an eternal truant while
Elspeth Shaw's Wendy does her best to chivvy him into early domesticity, and
Catherine Evers gives Mrs Darling's solos the emotional quality the
choreography omits.
I would love to say that they got the thing airborne, but what I can say is,
it's not their fault that it lies on stage twitching with less finesse than the
crocodile. I feel for them.

A golden retriever saved her owner's life early yesterday when flames swept
through their home as he slept.
Sandy dragged the blankets off 44-year-old Charles Blackmore, of St Ann's,
Nottingham, and then tugged at his arm to wake him.

Winners in fashion must know what suits to play for. John Davidson comes up
trumps with a selection of top designs for the leader of the pack
LET'S play poker. Fashion poker. It's a game of skill, not chance, where
accomplished players make the best of whatever attributes cruel fate (and
sponge cake) has dealt them.
A strictly tailored suit is the disciplined fashion option. In the business
world, it is the sartorial synonym for serious; style shorthand for ``No
messing''. A suit carries the implicit suggestion of formality - demanding
attention, commanding respect.
Fashion's trump card is the suit which creates an aura of sophistication the
very instant a woman slips it on.
She is immediately transported from the struggle of her workaday existence to
the threshold of glamour. Which is exactly where young British design duo,
Pearce Fionda, are taking their followers.
Who plays fashion's knave? There are so many potential candidates - designers
whose creations are cruel and unflattering to the women who fall beneath their
spell.
Or there is Thierry Mugler, whose razor-sharp cut produces the sexiest
silhouette conceivable in gaberdine tailoring.
His suits are serious business, cut to define an hourglass figure, yet their
structure is clever enough to coax the illusion of perfect proportions from a
figure which may not be curvy in quite the right places.
There is a joker in every pack. And in the fashion pack, it was a role
gloriously fulfilled by the late Franco Moschino.
His quirky humour coupled to extraordinary elegance lives on in the
idiosyncratically titled Cheap &amp; Chic collection. Cardsharps should love this
winter's skirt formed from two trompe l'oeil playing cards.
Jackets emblazoned with the legend ``Let's twist again'' are a must-have for
pontoon players. And the little black suit trimmed with dainty bows and ruffled
tulle is fit for any Queen of Hearts.
